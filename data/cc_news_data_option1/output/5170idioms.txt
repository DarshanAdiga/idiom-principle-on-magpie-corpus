When I hear any mention of Olympic Boulevard, my mind immediately leaps to the Mariscos Jalisco food truck, the all-white lonchera that has been parked more or less in the same spot on an industrial strip for a decade, and whose tacos dorados de camarón and chile-blistered seafood tostadas are widely considered the best in Los Angeles. Sitting there on the low brick stoop in front of the lonchera, among parents wrangling kids and teenagers laughing loudly, it might be the most visceral two or three bites in the city. The fresh-fried, perfect half-moon taco shatters into salty morsels between your teeth. Somehow the shrimp are impossibly springy, creamier than you remember, and the crisp shell dampened by rough-chopped tomatoes, onions and slivers of ripe avocado. There is more to Mariscos Jalisco than crunchy shrimp tacos, of course — the aguachile is bracingly fresh and spicy, and the Poseidon, an ultra-spicy conflagration of octopus, ceviche and shrimp aguachile, is equally legendary.

To the dismay of those wishing to finally resolve a lingering, thorny issue for the community college district, officials agreed to continue deliberations and analysis of the operating contract for the San Mateo Athletic Club.


  The San Mateo County Community College District Board of Trustees decided during a meeting Monday, Dec. 14, to take more time trying to resolve the question of which company will run the gym located on the College of San Mateo campus.


  But following more than six months of discussing whether the district will extend its deal with current operator Exos, trustees shared their frustration with taking up the issue during a meeting only weeks away from an approaching contract expiration date at the end of the year.


  “I wish our staff had not put us into this bind. It’s not how I think we should be operating,” said board Vice President Richard Holober, who directed his displeasure at an administrative team which he believes disobeyed previous instruction from the board.


  Holober said he felt trustees had been clear in telling the administrative cabinet that they would prefer for the issue to be brought up for a decision at an earlier meeting. But with the item not put on the agenda for a vote at the most recent meeting, he felt trustees were backed into a corner with limited options other than to grant a temporary extension of the existing contract.


  “I’m troubled when the board gives direction to staff to do something, that direction was not followed. That is a big problem for me,” he said.


  Trustee Maurice Goodman agreed that the board was in a tight spot, noting that trustees John Pimentel and Lisa Petrides were recently sworn into office and that the new additions would likely need more time to be briefed on the issue.


  “We need to have a sense of urgency to see how we can best move forward to ensure the public is a part of this and that our trustees are brought up to speed,” he said.


  Officials in June agreed to issue a request for proposals to seek other companies which may be interested in running the gym, and said they will look into the costs associated with the district running the facility as well.


  With the request for proposals still incomplete, officials are considering exercising a contract term allowing Exos to continue running the gym for three more months past the January expiration deadline while the process finalizes.


  Goodman said he would be comfortable granting the extension, if Exos signed a document guaranteeing it would not sue the district if officials ultimately select a new operator. If the company would not make such an agreement, Goodman urged officials to act swiftly and schedule a special meeting before the end of the year to make a binding decision on the operations contract.


  Considering the magnitude of the decision, board President Thomas Nuris encouraged officials to move deliberately.


  “We need to look at it carefully and not rush into it because haste in this case may make some serious waste,” he said.


  For her part, Petrides said she looks forward to officials finding some resolution on the issue.


  “I myself am very much anticipating the legal briefing we will be able to get now that we are sworn in, as well as actually coming to some resolve on this issue that is mystifying to me as to why the current board hasn’t been able to resolve until now,” she said.


  Petrides added that she had hoped the previous iteration of the board would have made a decision on the issue before new trustees were sworn into office.


  Pimentel concurred, saying he is willing to do whatever it takes to close the book on this problem so officials can direct their attention back to the assuring the district is offering the best education possible to its local school community.


  “I really don’t want to deal with this anymore,” he said.


  In other business, Pimentel was sworn into office after winning the District 5 race in the fall election. Petrides took the oath of office to represent District 1 and Goodman started his new term representing District 3 after defeating fellow former colleague Dave Mandelkern in November. Holober took over role as vice president from Nuris, who assumed the seat as president following the departure of former trustee Karen Schwarz.

The long-awaited return-to-sports guidelines were released by the California Department of Public Health Monday night, giving high school athletics a new timeline to follow.


  “I was watching Monday Night Football and started getting all these texts,” said Steve Sell, Central Coast Section president, as well as Aragon athletic director and football coach.


  “I was, like, ‘Whoa.’ Now, we’re all trying to figure out what it all meant.”


  The guidelines apply to all form of amateur and recreational sports that are allowed in the state — including club and private teams. But it was the road map for which athletic directors and coaches have been waiting.


  “We’re desperate for anything that someone can interpret as good news,” Sell said. “We have more information. We have more answers. But at this point, the questions still outweigh the answers.”


  The CDPH guidelines said actual games are not allowed before Jan. 25, but that date is still not set in stone. The guidelines will be revisited at a meeting Jan. 4, so while that Jan. 25 date may be good news through the holiday season, the goal posts can still move, so to speak.


  While the start date for games has been announced, there is also still a question as to when teams can return to full practice and begin ramping up for real interscholastic competition.


  “The thing that scared me about this document was the language ‘we can change this at any time,’” Sell said, referencing the guidelines that said, “The return-to-competition date will be reassessed by January 4, 2021, based on California disease transmission trends and is subject to change at any given time, given the level of COVID-19 transmission in California.”


  “They left themselves an escape clause,” Sell continued.


  As things currently stand, all outdoor sports activity will return to action before games and matches that are played inside gyms. Which tier a sport is placed is based on the category in which it falls: sports that can be easily socially distanced can compete in the purple tier, moderate-contact sports in the red and so on.


  If San Mateo County continues to stay in the virus’ purple tier, the most restrictive of the four-tier colored risk-assessment system, the sports that would be allowed to begin competition Jan. 25 would be cross country, golf, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field.


  Sports that can begin competition in the red tier include baseball, girls’ lacrosse and softball. Sports in the orange tier are football, boys’ lacrosse, soccer volleyball and water polo. Basketball and wrestling are the only sports offered that require the county to be the yellow tier — the least restrictive. They are both high-contact sports played indoors, but Sell said there have been discussions about finding a way to play basketball games and hold wrestling matches outside.


  “We had a coaches’ meeting and it was brought up … bringing wrestling mats outdoors. … I asked some of the basketball players in my classes, ‘What are the best outdoor courts out there?’” Sell said. “It gives a whole new meaning to working on your outside shot.”


  Of those sports allowed to compete in the purple tier, only cross country is slated to play in the Season 1 of the CCS sports calendar. All the rest begin in Season 2 which may lead to some sports deciding to forgo the CCS playoffs — assuming they section’s calendar remains as is.


  If any sport can hit the ground running, it should be cross country and many of those dedicated to the sport have been training on their own. But training at home and preparing for race conditions are two different things and Menlo School cross country coach Jorge Chen said many coaches are already preparing their runners for less-than-ideal times this season.


  “I believe the top coaches in our section are letting the kids know that this (situation) is not ideal,” Chen said. “At the same time, we have to keep the kids positive. … I was assuming our cross country season would be canceled. … Just getting them out there is a win.”


  The various high school districts in San Mateo County are working on a return-to-play plan that would, in some respects, go against the current CCS playoff plan in place. But the general consensus around the Peninsula Athletic League, especially, is that many athletic programs are simply looking to get the kids out and playing.


  Golf is a prime example of what it will take to get a season played. According to the CCS calendar, both the boys’ and girls’ seasons are to be played in Season 2. The San Mateo Union High School District is working on a plan, in conjunction with the other districts, of splitting up the girls’ and boys’ seasons. Splitting them up would allow schools better access to already overflowing golf courses.


  “We’re one of the few sports that don’t have facilities on (campus) site,” said Jimmy Ikeda, SMUHSD girls’ golf coordinator and coach of the San Mateo girls’ and boys’ golf teams.


  Poplar Creek has been the home course for the schools in the SMUHSD, but Ikeda said he is reaching out to other local courses as well, hoping spread the impact of trying to play a high school golf match.


  “We’re looking at Mariners (Point), Crystal (Springs). Looking to see if any of the country clubs can host us,” Ikeda said. “It’s still a work in progress, but I’m pretty sure I can get what I need to.”


  The proposal would mean, however, the girls’ golf season would be giving up its CCS playoff chances as the PAL schedule would not align with the section’s.


  Ultimately, the goal of many coaches and administrators is to get kids back on the field, out of the house, off the computer and back interacting and socializing with their peers.


  “The main focus is to get as many kids playing sports as soon as possible,” Sell said. “That is the guiding factor. If postseason play is a casualty of that? So be it.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Top congressional leaders are closing in on an agreement on a long-delayed COVID-19 relief package, hoping to seal an agreement as early as Wednesday that would extend aid to individuals and businesses and help ship coronavirus vaccines to millions.Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a coauthor of a $908 billion bipartisan package, said leadership negotiators are closing in on an agreement that would extend direct payments of $500-$600 to most Americans but would deny Democratic negotiators long- sought aid to state and local governments.“We made major headway toward hammering out a bipartisan relief package,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.The negotiators are closing in on an agreement around $900 billion, which would include a new round of stimulus checks, enhanced federal unemployment insurance benefits, and other avenues for delivering aid to states, localities, territories and tribes, according to two people familiar with the talks and authorized to characterize them. Their statement said that a GOP-sought provision shielding businesses from COVID-19-related lawsuits would be dropped.“I think they’re basically now putting it all together,” Manchin said on CNN. “We were able to break the gridlock.”Other aides following the talks offered more cautious assessments. The emerging package is serving as a magnet for add-ons and the two sides continue to swap offers.It is also apparent that another temporary spending bill will be needed to prevent a government shutdown at midnight on Friday. That is likely to easily pass.House lawmakers are returning to Washington Wednesday in hopes of a vote soon on the emerging package, which would combine the $900 billion in COVID-19 relief with a $1.4 trillion governmentwide funding bill and a host of other remaining congressional business.A new edict from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., requires members to wear masks at all times on the House floor, including while speaking.Negotiations on COVID-19 relief intensified on Tuesday after months of futility. The top Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress met twice in hopes of finally cementing a leadership agreement that would revive subsidies for businesses hit hard by&nbsp;the pandemic, help distribute new&nbsp;coronavirus vaccines, fund schools and renew soon-to- expire jobless benefits.Republicans labored to keep the price tag for the long-delayed rescue package in check, seeking to prevail in a battle over help for state and local governments, while capping the cost of bonus jobless benefits and direct payments sought by Democrats.After two meetings in Pelosi’s Capitol suite, where Democrats pressed for more generous steps such as direct payments of to help individuals struggling in&nbsp;the COVID-19 economy, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., gave an upbeat assessment.“I think we’ve built a lot of trust,” McCarthy said. “I think we’re moving in the right direction. I think there’s a possibility of getting it done.”The uptick in activity could be a sign that an agreement is near, though COVID-19 relief talks have been notoriously difficult.Pressure for a deal is intense. Unemployment benefits run out Dec. 26 for more than 10 million people. Many businesses are barely hanging on after nine months of the pandemic. And money is needed to distribute new vaccines that are finally offering hope for returning the country to normal.McConnell is playing a strong hand in the lame-duck session and pushed hard to get Democrats to drop a much-sought $160 billion state and local government aid package. Several senior Democrats, including close allies of President-elect Joe Biden — who is eager for an agreement — have said they would go along now and fight for the aid next year. Democrats cited other gains for states and localities in the emerging deal such as help for transit systems and vaccine distribution.Pelosi has insisted for months that state and local aid would be in any final bill, but as time is running out, Democrats appear unwilling to hold the rest of the package hostage over the demand.“We’re not going home until this is done,” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said on CNN Tuesday morning. “We’ve got to get people a lifeline.”Manchin is an architect of a bipartisan $748 billion aid package that is aimed at serving as a template for the leadership talks. President Donald Trump’s chief negotiator, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, supports a package with many similar elements. There is also bipartisan support for transportation and transit assistance, funding for rural internet service and help for the Postal Service, among other provisions.Lawmakers also worked to finalize a yearend catchall funding package that will be the basis for the last significant legislation of the Trump presidency.There’s a hoped- for deadline of midnight Friday to deliver the completed package to Trump. That is when a partial government shutdown would arrive with the expiration of last week’s temporary funding bill. But there’s no guarantee that the massive yearend measure will be completed in time. If the talks drag, further temporary bills could be needed.Negotiations on the $1.4 trillion catchall spending bill are virtually completed, lawmakers say, One hard-fought compromise would deliver another $1.4 billion or so for a final installment to continue construction of his long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.The post- election lame-duck session is the last chance to wrap up the unfinished work this year, a goal of all involved, though they have been slow until now to forge the often-tricky compromises required to pull the measure together.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Williamsport -- Louis E. “Lou” Hunsinger, Sr., 86, of Williamsport died at home on Monday, December 14, 2020, surrounded by his loving family and friends after an extended illness.


  He was born June 23, 1934 in Williamsport, a son of the late Bruce H. and Helen (Hawk) Hunsinger. On May 26, 1956, he married Doris Nance, who survives.


  Lou graduated from Williamsport High School, Class of 1952 and from the Williamsport Technical Institute in 1959 with a degree in business management. He was honored by the Williamsport Area Community College as “Alumnus of the Year” in 1977.


  He served his country honorably in the U.S. Air Force from 1953-57 and the Civil Air Patrol from 1949 to 1980. He served as Squadron Commander of CAP Squadron 401 from 1966 to 1970, before being promoted to Group 40 Staff and later as a member of the Pennsylvania Wing Staff. He retired with the rank of major. He was honored with Civil Air Patrol’s Meritorious Service Award in 1973 for his work during the Hurricane Agnes Flood of 1972. He gave a report at the Pentagon to Defense Department officials on the local CAP squadron’s efforts during the 1972 flood and showed a slide presentation detailing that work. He was the first CAP official ever to give a report at the Pentagon.


  He sold life insurance for 30 years with the Baltimore Life (Life of Maryland) Company.


  He served as Emergency Management Director for the City of Williamsport from 1976 to 1996 and again from 2002 through 2004, under Mayors Kirby, Lucasi, Bloom, Prezsiosi, Rafferty and Wolf. In connection with that, he served for many years as a member of the Lycoming County Emergency Preparedness Committee.


  He served on many public spirited committees, the most recent being the organizing committee of the annual Grand Slam Parade and the Lycoming Brotherhood Alliance.


  He was honored by the Williamsport-Lycoming Foundation as one of it’s “Men of the Year” in 1996. The next year, in 1997, he was honored by the local chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews as one its “Citizens of the Year.”


  Lou was a 73 year member of St. John’s-Newberry United Methodist Church, where he helped his brother, Skip when he started the Senior Citizen’s Lunch. He served at the Community Arts Center as a greeter, starting in 1995, where he was very active with the “Skip Hunsinger Children's Christmas Spectacular.”


  Lou was as Life Member of the Old Lycoming Fire Volunteer Fire Co., where he served as a Trustee for several years and as a Fire Policeman. In the aftermath of the disastrous January 1996 flood, he helped coordinate flood clean-up efforts in Old Lycoming Township. He was also hired by Lycoming County to supervise public service workers during the clean-up. He received Fire Police of the year in 2007 and the President’s Award in 2015.


  He was a member of the Korean War Veterans of Lycoming County, Lodge #755, F&AM and a former member of the Zafar Grotto.


  Lou believed strongly in the concept of service to others as well as community service, a concept he passed on to his children and friends and served as an example to all who knew him.


  In addition to his wife of 64 years, Lou is survived by his three children, Lou Jr, Montoursville, Kathleen (Terry) Keagle, Linden, and Karen (Curt) Ertel, Harrisburg; three grandchildren, TerriLynn Keagle, Matthew (Erica) Ertel, and Kenneth (Chuck) Ertel-Hoy; and three great-grandsons, Logan, Avery and Grayson; and brother John Hunsinger, Montoursville.


  Lou was preceded in death by his brother Harold L. “Skip” Hunsinger, sister, Emily Sullivan and a daughter-in-law, Mary.


  Services will be held privately with burial in Wildwood Cemetery due to current health restrictions. A recording of the service will be available later this week under Lou’s memorial page where condolences may also be made at www.SandersMortuary.com.


  Memorial contributions can be made to St. John’s-Newberry United Methodist Church, 2101 Newberry St. Williamsport, Pa. 17701

This is the first time the Lions and Titans will see each other on the football field since 2016. That season, the upstart Titans won a hard fought 16-15 game at Ford Field. As a whole, the Lions have not had much luck beating the Titans on the field whatsoever. Tennessee is 9-3 against the Lions all- time, and has won the last five contests in a row dating back to 1995. That was Detroit's last win in the series, so the Lions are certainly overdue. The last pair of games have been close, with the Lions losing a wild game in overtime in 2012, and the narrow loss in 2016 both on their resume recently. Safe to say this hasn't been a friendly matchup at all for the Lions historically, and that might be the case once again in 2020.

Since the turn of the new millennium, most Americans have been systematically indoctrinated to not trust our government. So here we find ourselves in the biggest health crisis in 100 years, and the country is divided between left and right, rich and poor.


  I am a pacifist. I hope if we start turning on each other, it is for more than a mask and the perceived relinquishing of freedoms.


  I suppose there is always some reason to go off to war, be it real or fabricated. Let’s just love one another and trust one another. And be strong.

Die Regelhüter des International Football Association Board (IFAB) haben einer Testphase für eine zusätzliche Auswechslung beim Verdacht auf eine Gehirnerschütterung zugestimmt. Wie das IFAB und der Fußball-Weltverband FIFA am Mittwoch mitteilten, sollen die Versuche im Januar beginnen. Interessierte Konföderationen, Verbände und Wettbewerbsorganisatoren können sich für eine Teilnahme an der Testphase bewerben.


  Dadurch soll die Hemmschwelle sinken, Spieler bei entsprechendem Verdacht auf Kopfverletzungen gleich aus dem Spiel zu nehmen. Die Regel soll sicherstellen, dass das Wohl der Spieler im Vordergrund steht, den betroffenen Teams aber kein zahlenmäßiger oder taktischer Nachteil entsteht. Erst am vergangenen Wochenende hatte Schalkes Mark Uth in der Bundesligapartie beim FC Augsburg eine Gehirnerschütterung erlitten.


  Darüber hinaus verlängerte das IFAB die temporäre Erlaubnis von fünf Wechseln pro Team für nationale Wettbewerbe bis 31. Dezember 2021 und für internationale Wettbewerbe bis 31. Juli 2022. Diese Regeländerung war aufgrund der Corona-Pandemie eingeführt worden, um die Belastung von Spielern im eng getakteten Terminkalender zu reduzieren. Ob sie zur Anwendung kommt, entscheiden aber die jeweiligen Verbände oder Organisatoren.

  Auf Anpassungen bei der Handspielregel konnte sich das IFAB am Mittwoch aber nicht einigen. Das Thema soll bei der Hauptversammlung am 5. März 2021 auf die Agenda kommen.

Die Vereinsleute hatten sich einiges ausgedacht: „Um die Spannung für die Kinder etwas aufzubauen, hatten wir mit der Post abgesprochen, dass für jede Klasse ein Brief vom Weihnachtsmann aus Himmelpfort den Weg in die Klassen findet“, so der Vereinschef. „Diese sind auch rechtzeitig angekommen.“ Die 19 Briefe wurden am Montagmorgen in den Klassen verteilt. Die Lehrkräfte werden diese digital in den Plattformen für das Distanzlernen den Kindern zur Verfügung stellen.


  „Insgesamt haben wir fast 1000 Euro für die Geschenke ausgegeben“, erklärt Thomas Meyfarth. „Darunter etliche Gesellschaftsspiele, ein paar Bücher, Tischtennisschläger, Softbälle, Springseile, ein paar große Sitzsäcke und 15 Tabletts. Und natürlich ist auch schon alles verpackt. Jedes Kind sollte und wird auch einen Schokoweihnachtsmann-Lolly bekommen.“


  Am Sonnabend konnte Thomas Meyfarth zudem im Edeka die nächste Pfandbonspende entgegennehmen. „Es sind wieder tolle 470 Euro zusammengekommen. Auch wenn das Geld nun nicht sofort den Kindern zugutekommt, es wird zu 100 Prozent in den Schulklassen landen und den einen oder anderen Wunsch der Kinder erfüllen. Wir werden sehr wahrscheinlich in der ersten Woche nach dem Lockdown die Kinder mit den Geschenken überraschen. Wie wir das anstellen, ist noch offen, aber sehr wahrscheinlich werden wir eine Variante des Plan B organisieren, so dass wir auch nach dem Lockdown eine größtmögliche Kontaktvermeidung sicherstellen können.

Long Beach’s landmark Cambodian noodle restaurant specializes in kuy teav, a traditional breakfast soup layered with springy noodles, aromatics and various porky odds and ends. The clear, wholesome broth is lovely, vaguely sweet and vivid with cilantro, green onions and the deep musk of garlic. For ballast, order the seafood version laden with shrimp, fish cake, squid, scallops and mussels; the chluy bowl, furnished with chewy flaps of beef intestine and pork rinds, is particularly lush. Perhaps the most comforting thing on the menu is the terrific chicken porridge, which tastes wonderful with the airy, baton- like donut called cha quai. You dip it in the fragrant creamy whorl and the fried dough dissolves as naturally as snow melting in sunshine.

If Bill Powers had his way, San Diego’s public utility would operate more like the San Diego Unified School District (which is not without its own set of unsavory problems). It’d have its own budget and an independent board elected by the public that’s not beholden to the City Council or the mayor’s will. While the city could choose to make it a department, that might be a harder sell to a public familiar with disappointments like the recent overbilling scandal at the San Diego Public Utilities Department, Powers said.

United Airlines said it will work on a contact tracing program to support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or CDC's efforts to lessen the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. and around the world.


  United will collect detailed customer contact information for all international and domestic flights.


  United customers will be prompted during the check-in process to voluntarily opt-in and provide their contact information such as an email address, phone numbers and a destination address. These details were previously difficult for the CDC to obtain in real-time, United noted.


  United will roll out the contact testing program in phases from this week with the voluntary collection of information for all international arrivals. The airline will then phase in domestic and international outbound departures in the coming weeks.


  In October, United had started a customer COVID-19 testing program at San Francisco International Airport by offering customers travelling from San Francisco to Hawaii to choose between a rapid test at the airport or a drive- through option. The program allows customers with a negative result to bypass Hawaii's mandatory quarantine requirements.       ---       In addition, United has participated in two international test programs. In November, the airline announced a free transatlantic COVID-19 testing pilot program for customers on board select flights from Newark Liberty International Airport to London Heathrow.


  In December, United expanded its customer testing efforts by adding a new mail-in test option for flights out of Houston to select destinations in Latin America as well as the Caribbean.


  In the same month, Delta Air Lines announced a similar contact tracing program, saying it is partnering with the CDC to keep international customers informed of potential COVID-19 exposure through contact tracing.


  Starting December 15, the airline requires customers traveling to the U.S. from an international location to voluntarily provide five pieces of information to aid contact tracing and public health follow-up efforts. This includes email address, address in the U.S., and two phone numbers.

It is worth mentioning that as per the analysts at Baird Equity Research, there has been an encouraging increase in patient volumes despite the rise in case counts in some states of the country. Although the pandemic continues to rage, companies involved in this space have been exhibiting gradual recovery from the month of July and we expect them to ride this favorable trend well into 2021.      The risk of contracting the virus has led to lower number of patient appointments available on a daily basis but clinicians have taken actions to counteract this impact. While some clinicians have resorted to teledentistry; others, especially dental support organization customers, have been focusing on maximizing patient procedures per visit.      Further, amid the ongoing pandemic, dental consumables and lower-cost equipment have been in demand among dentists, who are likely to be wary of making large investments in high-cost equipment.      Given the recovery path, most of the companies in this space are well positioned to deliver improved performance heading into 2021 on the back of new product launches and remote consultation technologies.

Short of trading one of their top players like Nikola Vucevic, Aaron Gordon or Evan Fournier, there isn’t a clear avenue for the Magic to get drastically better, and their offseason bore that out. They signed Dwayne Bacon to a two- year deal, and while he shot 43.7% from 3-point range two seasons ago, he hardly moves the needle. Michael Carter-Williams and Gary Clark re-signed, but they top out as decent second unit rotation pieces. With D.J.
