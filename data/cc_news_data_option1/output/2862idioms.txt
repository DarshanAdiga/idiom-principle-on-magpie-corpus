So spoke Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum on Friday. Taken alone, the statement is of course inarguable, but not for the reasons Rosenblum thinks. What civic plague is it that she finds so repulsive? What is it she fears will spread from the idyllic streets of Portland to the rest of the country? Not the rioting that for weeks has convulsed the city's downtown, certainly. Nor is it the property damage and disruptions to the daily lives of those who live and work in the affected area that discomfits the state's top law enforcement official. No, all of that is accepted, even welcomed, in the name of the progressive movement, of which Portland is vying with Seattle, San Francisco, and Minneapolis to be the capital. Rather, it is the efforts of federal law enforcement officials to accomplish what local authorities have been unable or unwilling to bring about: the restoration of order in the area near the city's federal courthouse, where anarchists have run amok for 52 consecutive nights.

Russell Crowe is still baffled over a 2015 bar meeting with Kanye West, during which the rapper clashed with a rugby player over a song lyrics mix-up.      Kanye joined the Gladiator star and former South Sydney Rabbitohs player Sam Burgess for a drink at The Dorchester hotel in London and offered to play the pals a snippet of his track FourFiveSeconds ahead of its release.      But Crowe reveals that what started as a little good-natured fun, turned nasty when Kanye became annoyed as Burgess mixed up the lyrics to the track as he tried to sing along.      "We were like, 'Yeah, it's great...', so he played it four or five times and at one point Sam is singing along, except he doesn't really know the words," Crowe tells Nova FM's Fitzy & Wippa. "I could see a little twitch in Kanye's eye.      "I said, 'Sam, you know you're getting the words wrong? And the wrong day?' And Sam was like, 'It doesn't matter what day it is, man'. Then he was like, 'Kanye, Kanye, does it matter what day it is?'      "Kanye just looked at him across the table and said, 'Yeah, it matters what day it is'.'      The Oscar winner first met Kanye in Australia, when the Stronger hitmaker discussed using material from Gladiator for an upcoming project.      News of Crowe's encounter with the rapper comes a day after Kanye staged his first election campaign rally in Charleston, South Carolina. .

At one point he openly sobbed onstage as he revealed he and his wife, Kim Kardashian, considered aborting their first child.

The renewal for the recreation millage is to maintain a 0.47 mills tax. It helps fund Oak Park events such as the Independence Day Parade, Summer Concerts, and Boo Bash, along with daily recreation programs and activities.
 “One of the main things it does is provide senior programming, including a senior shuttle service for appointments and recreational trips,” Tungate said. “
 Funding from the millage raises about $250,000 a year for the recreation department. The millage costs an owner with $100,000 taxable value on their home about $47 annually.
 That’s the same amount that property owners pay for Oak Park’s library millage.
 The library millage “is a substantial part of its budget,” Tungate said. “It funds about a quarter of their operations.”
 Oak Park officials put the renewal millages on the ballot Aug. 4 to better reach local voters on the issue.
 Reaching voters with town halls and discussions will be more of a challenge leading up to the national elections in November when many voters focus on the U.S. presidential and congressional races, Tungate said.
 Oak Park’s library and recreation department are closed and most of their employees are on furlough because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 However, those employees are expected to be called back when the two departments open, possibly as early as Aug. 1.

McDONOUGH COUNTY -- Rep. Norine Hammond and Sen. Jil Tracy met once again for a Zoom meeting on Friday to further discuss the reopening of Illinois.
   
 Grants were a big topic of discussion for the duo as they spoke about new and existing grants that businesses can apply for in the area.
   
 "Recently the state announced some broadband grants, which I think is very good for our rural areas to expand broadband and certainly with the pandemic that we've experienced with online learning and more people working from home," Tracy said.
   
 Broadband grants are focused on expanding internet service across the state. Tracy highlighted how important access to broadband is with the rise of online learning and telehealth services.
   
 Hammond said that she would like to see the state provide money directly to communities.
   
 "First of all, I think the communities are painfully aware of what their needs are," Hammond said. "Giving them the local control over those dollars is more prudent than having it perhaps go through the [Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity]."
   
 Hammond said she was "flabbergasted" that some businesses were not approved for funding through DCEO.
   
 Tracy also brought up CURE funds that provide assistance and relief to local governments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracy said that there was a bit of discussion at the Municipal League last week about where the CURE funds were going.
   
 "It wasn't quite as fairly apportioned as we would have like and in fact, we learned that downstate is perhaps getting shorted on some of that that was supposed to be going more downstate so we're going to make sure that those funds go to the local governments," Tracy said.
   
 Hammond spoke about how Cook County being divided grouped into its own region benefits Central and Western Illinois.
   
 "The most encouraging part of the redo of the regions as it affects us in West Central Illinois, is the fact that Chicago and Cook is now their own region," Hammond said. "They've got their own people to take care of and how their numbers go will certainly not affect those in the Western suburbs and other areas."
   
 Yet, Tracy and Hammond both spoke about their confusion about how McDonough County was placed into the same group as Rock Island Peoria and various Chicago collar counties when questioned about the grouping.
   
 "I would love to know the answer to that," Hammond said. "We have asked that of the administration and have pretty much been told, that's how it is."
   
 Another big topic of discussion is how the school year was going to look in the fall. Hammond said that as it stands now, the plans for the school year are day-to-day and that the state of Illinois has a lot of bridges to cross before students get back in the classroom.
   
 With the announcement that COVID-19 results and statistics are no longer being reported to the CDC, keeping track of positive cases was up for discussion.
   
 "That is worrisome," Tracy said. "We want to have the best data. So, again, I guess we'll be looking to your healthcare people to let us know what they're seeing, because that's how we've discovered this was even a change."
   
 Tracy said that she had just recently learned about the change and also questioned why it was made in the first place and. She said that it is an issue that needs to be brought up to the Governor's office.
   
 "First of all, I didn't even know that it was not working," Tracy said. "Was it not working for hospitals to report directly to the CDC? Why did we change it?"
   
 Hammond said that local health departments are the most important people when it comes to keeping track of cases in your area.
   
 "The reports that we get from the health departments are extremely helpful to us and I think to all of the residents," Hammond said. "Having those reports come through on a regular basis with numbers is very helpful."
   
 Hammond and Tracy were both asked multiple questions about possible legislation that would help parents deal with childcare if students are unable to return to school normally. Both Hammond and Tracy said that there is no current pending legislation and that the earliest time they would be able to submit anything would be in the Spring session in January 2021. Both expressed hope that local businesses and employers would be lenient with their employees with children.
   
 Meeting host Lauren Merritt asked Tracy and Hammond if they were concerned about rolling back to phase three of the COVID-19 recovery plan, citing community worries. Merritt asked what community leaders and businesses can do to help keep the virus away.
   
 "I don't see us going back to phase three but I think it's going to take a concerted effort to do that because of the spikes," Tracy said. "I think we're just going to have to keep vigilant and just keep trying to create new ways to do what we've done in the past."
   
 Tracy also said that wearing masks is very important and encourages everyone in the community to do their part in controlling the spread of COVID-19.
   
 "It's kind of nerve wracking right now to see a spike in the numbers, especially downstate so it's just something that we as the public are asking everybody to participate in the masks and it's a small discomfort for being probably one of the most proven ways to stop the spread," Tracy said.
   
 Hammond expressed optimism when it comes to containing the virus in the area.
   
 "I would like to say kudos to our region and what we've been able to do with keeping the numbers, in my opinion, at a pretty good level," Hammond said. "I'm hopeful that we don't have to think about going back to phase three because we are smarter than that and we are moving forward."
   
 Adrian MacGregor, a representative from McDonough County District Hospital, spoke in the meeting about various issues and things they hope to see from the state of Illinois going forward during the pandemic. The first issue MacGregor discussed was coverage of telehealth costs. MacGregor said that some private insurance companies are providing limited coverage for telehealth but said that across the board, it is not being recognized. MacGregor said that he doesn't believe that COVID-19 is going away anytime soon so telehealth will continue to be very important for patient care. MacGregor also said that the nurse staffing ratio needs to be made at the local level.
   
 Hammond and Tracy closed the Zoom meeting with a final question about the recent round of subpoenas served on House Speaker Mike Madigan.
   
 "It's just troubling. I know people in Illinois are just so tired of corruption. This year has been astounding. Norine had House members and we had Senate members. I still have a Senate member sitting on the Senate that's indicted," Tracy said. "The corruption has got to end and if this is it, I'm glad to see it."
   
 Hammond said that the subpoenas were expected and was not surprised when they were announced.
   
 "I think the $200 million fine is significant," Hammond said. "I think that is also telling that the fine could have been $800 million and it was not so they are certainly cooperating with this federal investigation with the FBI, Department of Treasury and other areas of law enforcement. It's a shame that Illinois continues to wear these black eyes and if this is what it's going to take to finally get to the bottom of this, then so be it."

Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, the Army officer who reported concerns about the President’s call with the president of Ukraine, recently retired. It was apparently under pressure. He was reportedly on the promotion list for Colonel but the President had planned to remove his name. Vindman was on the promotion list because his superiors rated him as deserving promotion. The list goes to the President before going to the Senate. While the President can remove someone it must be for cause. “Disloyalty” is not a cause. Vindman witnessed what he understood to be inappropriate action by Trump. He reported it as required by his oath. It had nothing to do with being “disloyal.” Even the Army said he had done nothing wrong. We know that the President had him (and his brother) unceremoniously escorted from the White House, “drummed out.” If the President planned to deny his promotion it is because he wanted to get even. It can’t be because “He hates Trump,” etc. (Late development: his name is on the list but that is irrelevant now; he retired.)
 Perhaps Trump and others believe military officers take a loyalty oath to the president. The oath I and every commissioned officer took says we will “... support and defend the Constitution of the United States. ...” There is nothing in that oath about supporting and defending, or being loyal to, the president. This was retribution, pure and simple.

GOG was famous for two things that allowed it to stand the test of time. It focused on making old games available today, something Steam doesn't really offer, and it provided these games without DRM, something no other games store will even consider. The first of these two have long been history and some fear that even the DRM-free spirit will soon be gone.

DEAR ABBY: My son-in-law was diagnosed with epilepsy 25 years ago. He typically has two or three seizures a year. He has seen a neurologist on and off over the years, but he has not been to the doctor for his medications in several years. He works in the medical field and gets his meds from the doctors he works...

Say that an investor reads in the morning newspaper that stock prices rose to record-breaking highs on the previous day. The one who believes that stock price changes are determined by economic realities gets excited. Rising prices means improving economic conditions, which permit us all to live better lives. The one who believes that stock price changes are determined by shifts in investor psychology has a more ambivalent reaction. He is of course happy to see the size of his portfolio increase. But he foresees stocks offering smaller returns on a going forward basis as irrational exuberance is always transformed into irrational depression in the long run. So the positives of a price increase are countered by the negatives of a price increase.

Now what?
 They all heard the sobering words from athletics director Earl Hilton, his voice choked with emotion during a Zoom conference call hours after the announcement. The video clip has made the rounds on social media.
 “These are not opportunities that will come again for many of these student- athletes,” Hilton said. “I’ll be there and you’ll be there next football season. But my seniors might not be. These (college careers) are time-limited. They expire.”
 Fifteen of A&T’s seniors are redshirt or fifth-year guys with just one year of eligibility remaining.
 For them, a fall without football could be the end of their playing days.
 “It’s tough having the season end so abruptly like this,” said Mac McCain, a senior who starred at Dudley. “It’s tough not knowing what the next move is going to be and how the NCAA is going to handle everything. Are they going to give everybody an extra year (of eligibility)? Are they going to push the season back to the spring? There’s just a lot up in the air.
 “Right now, I’ve got mixed feelings. But I have faith, and I believe God has a master plan. I have to walk by faith and not by sight.”
 ## ‘Guys need this year’
 McCain, a two-time All-America cornerback with elite speed, came back from a knee injury and started nine games last year. The defensive MVP of the 2017 Celebration Bowl, McCain is among a handful of A&T seniors considered pro prospects.
 “This senior class is special. Real special. We have a lot of great athletes who could possibly play at the next level,” McCain said. “So this year means a lot to them. A lot of guys need this year so they can show (pro scouts) something. …
 “There’s always something for me to prove. I wanted this year to solidify everything. I didn’t want to leave any questions (about my knee) on the table. This senior year, I wanted to remove any and all doubts and have a great year.”
 Richie Kittles, the defensive MVP of the 2018 Celebration Bowl, missed all of last season recovering from his own knee injury. With his medical redshirt year spent, the fifth-year player safety faces a tough choice.

Just the uncertainty of it all. We were gearing up for our busiest season yet and feeling so good about the direction that business was heading. I was really blindsided by the shut down, but I knew it was the right move. The first two weeks were filled with emotion. I really thought we were destined to throw in the towel. That feeling quickly lifted and we found a way to pivot. However, the familiarity of what we once were has dissipated. We are only about a third of what we used to be in regard to how we are functioning and making money. That's a little exciting and scary. This is our livelihood. I have a mortgage, two sons, insurance ... all of those adulty things. I'm typically a risk-taker, but generally on my own terms. The pandemic definitely took the wind out of our sails in 2020, but we are hustlers.
