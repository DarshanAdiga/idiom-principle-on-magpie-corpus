Through another project, clients can sign up for a chat-text program to keep in touch with their therapist in between face-to-face visits. The program uses an algorithm that detects key words and asks automated questions -- such as, "On a scale of 1 to 10, how is your mood today?" Answering a 1 or 2 would trigger a conversation with the therapist. The point is to keep tabs on clients' mental health, and force them to think about their well-being, outside of weekly or monthly visits.

Venette, who heads up a collaboration between the university and the MDA, also works with the U.S. Forest Service and is helping to develop a "bio-control" method of stemming the ash borer's spread. That involves the use of wasps that kill the insect in its larval stage, which otherwise has few other natural predators.
 He said the state is fortunate to have strong partnerships that make its fight against the ash borer a relative success, but cautioned that "the key is that we have to keep it up."
 Its unlikely in the long term that the ash borer will be eradicated, said MDA entomologist Angie Ambourn. The effect that it will have on the ash trees it feasts on will reveal itself only in time.

A fourth member of the Patriots has tested positive for COVID-19, forcing Monday night's game with the Denver Broncos to be postponed.
 The teams will instead meet next Sunday afternoon at Gillette Stadium, according to ESPN and the NFL Network, with this now becoming the bye week for the Patriots and the Broncos.
 The unnamed player was tested along with teammates on Saturday and learned at night that he was positive. The team was scheduled to report to the stadium on Sunday for a walk-through, but the facility was again closed.
 Quarterback Cam Newton, cornerback Stephon Gilmore and practice squad defensive lineman Bill Murray are already on the Patriots reserve/COVID-19 list.
 The Patriots and Broncos had their game moved from today at 4:25 p.m. to Monday at 5 p.m. on Thursday after Gilmore tested positive, forcing New England to cancel three straight days of practice.
 On Saturday morning, the stadium was reopened and the Patriots were able to hold their only practice of the week.
 The Broncos were scheduled to fly to New England today, but the league made the decision shortly after 9 a.m. not to play the game.
 Members of the Patriots will once again be tested for COVID-19 today and likely hold more virtual meetings.
 Newton tested positive for the virus last weekend, forcing the NFL to change the Sunday afternoon game against the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs to Monday night.
 Patriots players were not happy about having to fly to Kansas City on the day of the game last Monday.
 Some players moved into hotels in the Foxboro area in order to protect their families at home after the positive test results for Newton, Gilmore and Murray.
 During a video conference with the media Saturday afternoon, cornerback Jason McCourty didn't hold back when talking about how the situation is being handled by the NFL and the NFL Players Association.
 "Throughout all of this, the realization is it's not a league-wide thing. It's kind of a team thing,'' he said. "For us in this locker room, this is what we have between the players, the coaches, the administration, the staff, it's up to us to take care of one another to make sure physically we're all set and make sure mentally (too), because I think outside of here, the people who don't have to walk into our building whether it's the league office or whether it's the NFLPA, they don't care.
 "We're trying to get games played and we're trying to get the season going. For them, it's not about what's in our best interest or our health and safety. It's about what can we make protocol-wise that sounds good, looks good and how can we go out there and play games.
 "What I kind of learned personally throughout this situation it's going to be up to us as individuals in this building to really take care of one another and that's beyond just trying to be responsible and do things the right way COVID-related.
 "As we go through last week and this week, just mentally checking in on each other. There's guys staying in hotels this week away from their families. We've continued to stick together and build our bond as a team moving forward.''
 The Patriots sent two planes to Kansas City, one that included about 20 players and staff members who had been in close contact with Newton.
 Gilmore was on that plane, and he played the entire game against the Chiefs. The day after the game is when Gilmore tested positive.
 With the Patriots having the week of, it is quite likely that both Newton and Gilmore would be back on the field next Sunday when they finally play the Broncos.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Both sides in the debate over a ballot measure to change Illinois' income tax system from a flat-rate to a graduated structure have straightforward arguments Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker and other proponents call it the “fair tax” because it demands more from those with higher incomes. Those making less than $250,000 a year would pay no more than the current 4.95% flat rate. Opponents point to the state's history of political corruption, saying the proposal on the November ballot would loosen constitutional restraints on lawmakers' spending. THE PROPOSAL The ballot question would amend the Illinois Constitution to discard the current income tax system, in which every individual pays the same flat rate, 4.95%, and corporations pay 7%. It would set up brackets, like the federal government and 32 other states. The tax rate would increase with income. BIG STAKES, BIG MONEY Campaign group Vote Yes for Fairness has $56.5 million to spend on its campaign, all from billionaire Pritzker. A group backed by labor and other advocacy groups has raised $1.9 million. The Coalition to Stop the Proposed Tax Hike Amendment is not far behind, with $48.6 million in the bank — 97% of it coming from Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin. THE GENESIS The state Supreme Court invalidated a graduated tax approved in the 1930s. A flat tax of 2.5% on individuals and 4% on corporations in 1969 came months before a convention began writing a new state constitution. Delegates considered a graduated tax but ultimately were wary of asking voters to endorse a constitution with a new tax setup. Subsequent plans failed before Pritzker, who campaigned on the issue in 2018, got approval to put the question on the ballot. THE RATES Voters don't get to choose the rates....

As team members made changes, Galante would get texts alerting him to try it out on his prototype. He said this is the way they have to work. Speed is critical.
 In fact, working that way might even be a little quicker in some aspects, Galante said. Relaying ideas, which may have required a presentation previously, can be as simple as zipping texts back and forth.
 "It would have taken a little bit of time," Galante said. "Now that we're so used to this really iterative, quick communication, [I] just get a text. Before, they'd have to prepare something, and now it's like, 'No, no, he's there, he's available, let's just ask.' "
 While the home prototypes have been invaluable to refining the system, the true proving ground is the vehicle itself. Uconnect 5 appears to be passing that test with Galante's children, ages 9 and 6.
 The youngsters jumped in a Jeep Grand Cherokee equipped with the prototype unit and learned the system within a few seconds.
 "I just put it in front of them, and they're very curious. They were making pages and changing widgets and moving things around. I didn't have to say a thing," Galante said. "As soon as I saw that -- I mean it was 30 seconds and they had their own screens built. I said to myself, 'OK, I think we got something here.' "
 Galante's mother got in on the act, too, and was able to pick up on the intricacies of the system.
 Working from home, he said, has yielded an unforeseen benefit.
 "Designers, when you're more comfortable, when you're more in your element, it's a little easier to be even more creative, come up with new ideas and do all those things," he said. "A nice surprise of all this has been all of us designers are in our comfort zone. I've actually seen an explosion of creativity that I didn't expect."

Intersectionality was developed as a theory of practice by Dr. Kimberle Crenshaw and debuted in her legal essay in 1989. It was first created as a manner of understanding that the advances made within the Black community and for women continue to erase and neglect Black women. Since then it’s been applied to any approach that accounts for multiple realities at once. This richness, complexity, and nuance is where the beauty of the human spirit and experience lies.

Like so many rites, this one is a different this year.
 Usually, complaints about what the Bruins did or didn't do in the NHL Draft and free agent/trade markets come just as summer arrives. This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the criticism back to autumn.
 Never mind that at least some of general manager Don Sweeney's moves have a fighting chance of working out next season - especially if transactions made before the 2019-20 trade deadline are counted as acquisitions for '20-21.
 Take, for instance, the Bruins' forward group. Already set at the top (Brad Marchand-Patrice Bergeron-David Pastrnak) and bottom (Sean Kuraly-Par Lindholm-Chris Wagner), it has increasingly needed upgrades in the middle, so as not to waste the talents of Nos. 2 and 3 centers David Krejci and Charlie Coyle.
 Adding proven 20-goal scorer Craig Smith, who signed a three-year deal ($3.1 million salary cap charge) on Saturday, on top of the February acquisitions of Ondrej Kase and Nick Ritchie, represent Sweeney's biggest swings at the second and third line lines since he took over as GM in 2015. Unlike Rick Nash (2018) and Marcus Johansson (2019) and long-forgotten stabs like Drew Stafford and Lee Stempniak -- all acquired to give Krejci the viable right wing he has lacked since Jarome Iginla departed in 2014 - Kase and Smith aren't rentals. Neither is Ritchie -- who, like his brother Brett (not retained), was obtained to fill a third-line vacancy at left wing.
 Did Kase or Ritchie show much after they arrived? Nope. Can they be assessed fairly and accurately? Not really. They played a handful of games before COVID-19 ended the regular season in early March, and injuries (Ritchie) and quarantine (Kase) issues prevented them from full participation in the July training camp that could have helped them find chemistry before play resumed in August.
 Both are 24, but have significant NHL experience. Both have a year left on their contracts. Both should benefit from a full training camp, whenever that happens. And Smith, 31, hasn't started to show the mileage after nine years as a Predator as, say, David Backes was showing when Sweeney signed him to a too- long, six-year contract after Backes' 10 years of hard labor with the Blues.
 Jake DeBrusk-Krejci-Kase. Ritchie-Coyle-Smith. Anders Bjork pushing (still) for a full-time job. Do those second and third lines make the Bruins the Lightning? Certainly not. Do they give the B's a better starting point than last season, or its resumption? Certainly.
 Trying to blueprint the defense corps, though, is practically impossible. With Torey Krug snapped up by the Blues, and Zdeno Chara's status still unclear, Matt Grzelcyk is the only proven, full-time NHLer on the left side (and he's entering contract negotiations or arbitration), with emerging Jeremy Lauzon and depth veteran John Moore behind him.
 After three years in the No. 5-6 slot, Grzelcyk may be ready to graduate to the second pairing with Brandon Carlo, whose size can protect Grzelcyk as it did Krug. But there's no obvious candidate in that group to replace Chara on the top pairing with Charlie McAvoy. Lauzon has been solid enough in call-up situations from AHL Providence over the last two seasons to think he's ready for a full-time role, but an assignment on one of the top pairings might a stretch. Moore hasn't established himself in two years as a Bruin, but his experience allows him to be plugged in.
 A right side of McAvoy, Carlo, Connor Clifton and perhaps veteran Kevan Miller led Sweeney to stay out of the free agent market, which was overloaded with right-siders (Kevin Shattenkirk, Tyson Barrie, and Alex Pietrangelo, the latter still weighing his options through Saturday). The GM also said he'd explore trades to boost the left side, and indicated that a reduced-role return by Chara was still possible.
 Sweeney also broached the possibility of McAvoy, 22 and a three-year veteran, and Carlo, 23 with four years on his resume, mentoring younger defensemen.
 That's where things get very risky.
 The Bruins do have two former first-round picks in the pipeline in (No. 13 overall, 2015) and Urho Vaakanainen (No. 18, 2017), and after three and two seasons at AHL Providence, and it's time to see if they can play. And ordinarily, it's sound thinking to give young players early-season auditions, and then adjust accordingly.
 In this case, though, McAvoy and Carlo would be asked to mentor players of relatively the same age, and there's the very real possibility that the 202-21 season - now targeted for a Jan. 1 start - will either be shortened from 82 games, or super-compressed. A two- or three-week slump could be lethal to a team's playoff chances, so only teams committed to rebuilds can truly afford to take their lumps with young players.
 The B's could still be all right, especially if secondary scoring finally emerges. No Atlantic Division teams made moves that would seem to lead to drastic improvement, so it's still a Lightning-Bruins-Maple Leafs group at the top, with the Panthers and Canadiens possibly pushing from beneath.
 That said, it's not like the 2019 off-season, when the Bruins came off their Cup Final loss with the potential to fulfill their "unfinished business" mantra. In 2020-21, the theme might be more like "Hey, you never know."
