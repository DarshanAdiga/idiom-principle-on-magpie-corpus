That may have been the idea all along.

Whether or not those votes were in the best interests of those who cast them was highly debatable, but no one dared debate it.

 “I had the procedure and the nurse said afterwards it went really well.”
 But three days later, Bev’s hip pain started to get worse – and by the time she went to have her stitches out a week later she was in agony.
 It was then she claims her consultant dropped a bombshell.
 “He said, ‘well Beverley, I have to tell you your operation really didn’t go very well at all’.
 “He said when he got inside the hip it crumbled and I needed further operations,” she says.
 “I was numb. I couldn’t take it in. I asked what next and he said it would be urgent but because of Covid-19 things were up in the air.
 “I went home and over the following weeks the pain just got worse and worse despite painkillers they gave me. I couldn’t stand.

During my career as an automotive engineer at Ford Motor Company in the early 2000s, world-class vision system technology was already routinely being used for various applications on programs and production. However, the automation around the analysis had not yet come full circle. Today, it has. And with the latest iterations of smartphones for facial recognition and other functionality, most anyone with a smartphone already has a device using computer vision. Machine and computer vision are also being used in applications such as satellite geo-analytics, food safety and processing, agriculture operations, augmented reality, human emotion analysis, medical diagnostics, robotic guidance, quality control, transportation coordination, utilities, security surveillance, and more.

Rookie Jo Adell didn’t have a hit in the Angels’ 3-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Friday night. But his outfield assist on a one-out single in the ninth inning helped the Angels improve their record to 11-22.
 The Mariners had runners on first and second bases when Tim Lopes, representing the go-ahead run, rifled a hit into right field to cut their 3-1 deficit by one run.
 Adell moved swiftly toward the ball and scooped it after a few bounces. He then fired toward third base as José Marmalejos, who drew a walk ahead of Lopes, made an unwise turn around second.
 Adell’s throw was on target but didn’t have enough zip to reach third base on the fly. Shortstop Andrelton Simmons intercepted the ball on the first-base side before it could hit the ground and hurled it to third baseman Anthony Rendon for the second out of the inning.

In Italia ogni anno vengono colpiti da una neoplasia maligna circa 2.500 tra bambini e adolescenti, di cui 98 nella nostra regione e 37 in Romagna (province di Ravenna, Forlì, Cesena, Rimini). La terapia di un bambino o adolescente ammalato di tumore è complessa e la completa guarigione (biologica, psicologica e sociale) è un traguardo lento e sofferto, una strada in salita intervallata da tappe intermedie. Chi si occupa della cura dei pazienti oncologici deve avere come obiettivo il benessere di chi assiste e non può pertanto considerare di importanza secondaria il “supporto” che, nel caso dell’età evolutiva, deve essere rivolto al paziente e alla sua famiglia. L’intero nucleo famigliare deve essere preso in carico, dalla comunicazione della diagnosi, che rappresenta forse il momento più delicato e difficile, fino al ritorno alla normalità biologica e sociale o, nei casi sfortunati, fino all'ultimo minuto di vita del paziente. Su questa premessa è stato pubblicato “In viaggio con la valigia”, un manuale rivolto ai familiari dei bambini e degli adolescenti affetti da patologia oncoematologica che sarà consegnato ai pazienti e ai loro genitori al momento della comunicazione della diagnosi. Il libro è stato scritto a tre mani dalle dottoresse Roberta Pericoli (responsabile della struttura semplice Oncoematologia pediatrica di Rimini), Elena Fabbri (medico dell’Oncoematologia) e Samanta Nucci (psicologa). Vi sono descritti i principali tumori infantili e adolescenziali, i percorsi diagnostici e terapeutici, i principali effetti collaterali dei trattamenti, le strategie utili a ridurli e le principali problematiche di carattere psicologico. Il percorso dalla diagnosi alla fine delle cure è descritto simbolicamente come un viaggio e il manuale vuol rappresentare una sorta di valigia, contenente gli strumenti per affrontarlo in maniera più agevole e consapevole. Le spese di pubblicazione sono state interamente sostenute da AROP ONLUS a cui è possibile devolvere un'offerta per sostenere questa iniziativa. Dati d’attività dell’Oncoematologia pediatrica Dall’apertura del centro sono stati diagnosticate e trattate 350 neoplasie maligne, di cui circa la metà negli ultimi 6 anni (dall’avvio dell’Ausl Romagna), periodo nel quale sono afferite a Rimini 172 nuove neoplasie maligne in pazienti provenienti dalle diverse province della Romagna (media 28.6 l’anno) . L’attività media annua contempla: 1.340 infusioni di chemioterapici, 364 trasfusioni di emoderivati, 330 procedure in sedazione (aspirato midollare, biopsia ossea, rachicentesi).
