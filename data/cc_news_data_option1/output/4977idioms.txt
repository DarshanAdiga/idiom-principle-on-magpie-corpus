Lovece said she was angry that the county was grouped in the Southern California region with counties hundreds of miles away with far greater demands for ICU beds. Only one out of 53 ICU beds in San Luis Obispo county was occupied with a COVID-19 patient as of Thursday.
 The order is the latest balancing act as the state tries to slow the exploding infection rate -- blamed on people gathering outside of their households -- without further crashing the economy.
 After California closed all but essential businesses in March, the state lost 2.6 million jobs in two months. About 44% of those jobs returned when restrictions were eased as people heeded social distancing and mask-wearing precautions and new cases fell dramatically.
 But by fall people were congregating more for holidays and celebrations, while cooler weather drove them inside, where the virus flourishes. California is now averaging nearly 15,000 newly reported cases daily.
 Public health officials warn that the toll from Thanksgiving gatherings could start to swamp hospitals by Christmas.
 In the last month, the state imposed restrictions in 52 of the state's 58 counties, including asking people not to leave the state and implementing an overnight curfew for all but essential trips, such as getting groceries.
 But it hasn't worked because data shows people are ignoring the rules, Dr. Mark Ghaly, the state's top public health officer, acknowledged Thursday.
 "We of course had hoped and wanted to see more from that already, but we haven't," he said.
 The state might not need such a broad shutdown if it had better data on where people are being infected, said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health.
 Are stores and nail salons chiefly to blame or should restrictions be focused elsewhere? Lack of that knowledge reflects "a failure of public health," Klausner said.
 He likened the current approach to shutting down food production, restaurants and grocery stores because of a salmonella outbreak.
 "That's not the way we traditionally work in public health," he said.
 Some counties also have bucked the rules, following cues from state and local elected officials who have criticized the governor for going too far.
 Shannon Grove, Republican leader in the state Senate, criticized Newsom on Thursday for continuing "to disrupt life as we know it without releasing the full data behind his decisions."
 But in Los Angeles County, the nation's largest with 10 million residents, Sheriff Alex Villanueva announced that his department would be conducting "targeted enforcement on super-spreader events." The sheriff previously said he had relied on voluntary compliance with health orders.
 Even state government has felt the impact. Newsom and his family are self- quarantining at home after three of his children were exposed to an infected person. Two staff members in the governor's office have tested positive for COVID-19 but hadn't been in contact with Newsom, the office said.
 Beginning Monday, state government offices will close for three weeks except for those involved in "critical functions" such as public safety, prisons, social services and unemployment insurance claims processing, according to a Human Resources Department email sent to department leaders, the Sacramento Bee reported.
 Newsom acknowledged the difficulty in following the rules. But he urged people to stay vigilant and said progress is being made on a vaccine.
 "There is light at the end of the tunnel," he said.

When you start to read this, you will think that I am talking about the Rome Speedway. No, I am writing about the car races, foot races and all other kinds that come from being a police officer. They can occur at any time of the day or night and I have been involved in all of them.
 When you are young, you are foolish. It is in most of us that, while we are young, we are the best. There were times when it was a let-down to get beat by someone.
 Take the time when my partner and I were chasing a car out through the Armuchee area and he turned onto the Old Dalton Road and I drove by it. At the Old School Road, though, I made it back onto Old Dalton and the chase was on again. There, where the lake is, I was pushing him so hard he decided to stop.
 But just as his taillights came on, my police car came to a sudden stop. It felt like someone had grabbed it from the rear. The radio went out and we were in the middle of the road with everything off; nothing was working. I stepped out onto the road in time to see the car we were chasing take off at a high rate of speed. I raised the hood to find the battery hanging by one of the cables, almost dragging the road.
 I managed to get the battery back into its box. I put the hot cable on and, with a rock, managed to get it back down on the post. Everything started to work again. I drove back to headquarters and told the captain what had happened. I found out the next day that the mechanic had put in a new battery and forgot to fasten it in the box. We were lucky that when the battery fell out we did not wreck the patrol car.
 That wasn’t the only time that I can remember being lucky enough not to wreck the patrol car.
 When I went on the department, Turner McCall ended there where Ralph and Blanche had a cafe. It was in a corner next to the apartment house where Turner McCall intercepted East Second Avenue. The highway ended with a barricade and a high pile of dirt. Cars had busted down the barricade but managed to stop before going over the pile of dirt. The dirt was red clay, and the rain and weather had packed it down to the point where it was as hard as concrete.
 On this night we caught two people coming out of Elliot Sales. They jumped into a car and sped off. We followed with siren and blue lights on. They turned down the road beside the railroad tracks and made it to Brooks Avenue — which is now Turner McCall. In pursuit, we headed toward the barricade and the high pile of dirt. They hit the barricade and it went flying into the air. The car went over the top of the dirt.
 I managed to get the patrol car stopped about halfway to the top of the dirt. Dirt, smoke and screams pierced the night. I believe half the people that lived on Brooks Avenue were woke up. We scrambled from the patrol car and made it to the top of the dirt pile. I shined my light and saw two people scrambling to get out of the car, which was upside down.
 We got them and put them in the patrol car. It was a miracle that they were not hurt. With the car behind a wrecker we took them to headquarters and I turned the key on them.
 Every time my partner and I talked about it, we would shake our heads. Oh yes, did I mention that it was two girls in the car? And I almost forgot to say that the car was a new Cadillac belonging to someone’s daddy. Wonder what Daddy said when he saw the top of his new Cadillac — with less than 100 miles on it — flattened down to where you could not tell what it was.
 When I went on the Police Department I was young and fast. We would line up at Fifth and Broad and race to the Krystal. Last one there would have to buy the hamburgers. After the captain put me in the car with The Whizz I had a few good foot races. This is one that stands out in my mind:
 There was a grocery store on South Broad called Thomas. Purse-snatching went on there. We got a call that a lady’s purse had been snatched, and the culprit was going down South Broad. The only description was that he was wearing a red pullover shirt. As we approached East Main I saw him. “Get him,” Whizz yelled as he pulled in beside him. He looked at the police car and took off.
 I jumped out and went after him. He was no match. I had him by the belt before we had gone half a block. He still had the purse in his hand. I turned him around and bumped him on the seat of the pants and said, “Run.” I made him run back to where the patrol car was. If he slowed down, I would bump him again. We got back to the car and took him to the station, laughing at him all the way about how slow he was. I know he was glad when I finally turned the key on him.
 I can say I ran foot races with some of the best in those days. I am here to say there was very few that got away from me. When I tell this one, I take no shame in telling it.
 There was a man who walked Maple Street on crutches. I had talked to him a lot and got to know him. One day there was an incident where a child got hit by a car on Maple and the driver jumped out and ran. The man on the crutches pointed him out to me going down East 16th Street. I started to go after him when the man on the crutches went by me. “Come on,” he yelled. “I will help you.”
 I turned on the steam only to have him walk off and leave me. I lost them and was looking around when I saw the man on the crutches sitting on a wall in front of a house. I went to him. He pointed to a small shed and said, “He’s in there.” I walked over to the shed and saw someone hiding behind a riding lawn mower. He saw me and put his hands up and came out.
 When it was all over, I went over to tell the man on the crutches how much I appreciated his help. He smiled and said, “You need to practice running. You know, you are kind of slow.” I laughed with him and carried the hit-and-run man to jail. I thought I was fast, but when a man on crutches outruns you, I believe I did need some help.
 One time we got a call on a shoplifter who had stolen a new pair of shoes from a store in the mall. My partner and I came in from Turner McCall just as a description was given. We were going toward East Second Avenue, where the road made a bend, and I saw him. “Get him,” I told my partner.
 At that time, the only thing in that area was the bowling alley. I hit the ground running. Just as he made a jump for the river, I grabbed him. I held him, but the new shoes that he carried fell into the river. I took him back to the car. We locked him up for shoplifting but, needless to say, we didn’t get the shoes from the river.

 In another COVID-induced schedule twist, Coastal Carolina (9-0, No. 18 CFP) and BYU (9-0, No. 13 CFP) will square off after the Cougars stepped in to replace No. 25 Liberty.
 "We have a great mindset," Coastal Carolina coach Jamey Chadwell said. "We'll play whoever, wherever."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden is adjusting the scope of his agenda to meet the challenges of governing with a narrowly divided Congress and the complications of legislating during a raging pandemic.Rather than immediately pursue ambitious legislation to combat climate change, the incoming administration may try to wrap provisions into a coronavirus aid bill. Biden’s team is also considering smaller-scale changes to the Affordable Care Act while tabling the more contentious fight over creating a public option to compete with private insurers.Biden is already working on an array of executive actions to achieve some of his bolder priorities on climate change and immigration without having to navigate congressional gridlock.The maneuvering reflects a disappointing political reality for Biden, who campaigned on a pledge to address the nation’s problems with measures that would rival the scope of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal legislation. But Democrats acknowledge that big legislative accomplishments are unlikely, even in the best-case scenario in which the party gains a slim majority in the Senate.“Let’s assume my dream comes true,” Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said, referring to a tight majority for his party. “I think we have to carefully construct any change in the Affordable Care Act, or any other issue, like climate change, based on the reality of the 50-50 Senate.”“There’s so many areas, which we value so much that Republicans do not, that it will be tough to guide through the Senate under the circumstances,” the Illinois Democrat added.Biden’s agenda hinges on the fate of two Senate runoff races in Georgia, which will be decided on Jan. 5. If Democrats win both seats, the chamber will be evenly divided, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote.In that event, Biden’s agenda items stand a better chance of at least getting a vote. If Republicans maintain control, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might not bring the new president’s priorities to the floor.Biden’s initial focus on Capitol Hill will be a multibillion-dollar coronavirus aid bill, which is certain to require significant political capital after lawmakers have been deadlocked over negotiations on Capitol Hill for months.The president-elect said Thursday on CNN that while he supports a $900 billion compromise bill introduced this week by a bipartisan group of negotiators, the bill is “a good start” but it’s “not enough” and he plans to ask for more when he’s in office. His team is already working on his own coronavirus relief package.People close to Biden’s transition team say they’re looking at that stimulus as a potential avenue for enacting some climate reforms — like aid for green jobs or moving the nation toward a carbon-free energy system — that might be tougher to get on their own.Durbin mentioned President Barack Obama’s first term as a precedent for what Biden will encounter when he takes office.Then, Obama was forced to focus much of his early energy on a stimulus package to deal with the financial crisis, and he spent months wrangling with his own party on his health care overhaul. Obama also enacted financial regulatory reform, but other progressive priorities, like cap and trade legislation and immigration reform, ultimately lost steam.And he had a significant House and Senate majority at the time.Still, some Republicans argue that if Biden approaches negotiations in good faith, there are some common areas of agreement. Rohit Kumar, the co-leader of PwC’s Washington National Tax Services and a former top aide to McConnell, said it’s possible to find a compromise on some smaller-scale priorities, like an infrastructure bill, addressing the opioid crisis and even a police reform bill.“There is stuff in the middle, if Biden is willing to do deals in the middle — and that means being willing to strike agreements that progressive members don’t love, and maybe have them vote no, and be at peace with that,” he said.Indeed, speaking on CNN Thursday, Biden expressed optimism about cutting deals with Republicans. He said when it comes to national security and the “economic necessity” of keeping people employed and reinvigorating the economy, “there’s plenty of room we can work.”Still, he acknowledged, “I’m not suggesting it’s going to be easy. It’s going to be hard.”But here, progressives, not Republicans, could be the roadblock. Waleed Shahid, spokesperson for the liberal Justice Democrats, said progressives are “worried and anxious” about Biden’s history of making what he called “toxic compromises with McConnell.”“I think progressives will probably play a key role in trying to push Democrats to have a spine in any negotiations with Mitch McConnell,” he said. “People will hold him accountable for what he ran on.”Shaheed said he believes progressives could play a role in pushing the Biden administration to embrace a more “aggressive approach” and pursue executive actions to address some Democratic priorities.And indeed, Biden’s transition team has already been at work crafting a list of potential unilateral moves he could take early on.He plans to reverse Trump’s rollback of a number of public health and environmental protections the Obama administration put in place. He’ll rejoin the World Health Organization and the Paris climate accord and rescind the ban on travel from some Muslim- majority countries. He could also unilaterally reestablish protections for “Dreamers” who were brought illegally to the U.S. as children.But some of his biggest campaign pledges require congressional action and are certain to face GOP opposition.Biden has promised to take major legislative action on immigration reform and gun control, but prior legislative efforts on both of those issues — with bipartisan support — have failed multiple times.He’s also pledged to roll back the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy, forgive some student loan debt and make some public college free — all heavy lifts in a closely divided or Republican-controlled Senate.“It’s easy to be skeptical and pessimistic in this Senate,” Durbin said. “I hope that they give us a chance to break through and be constructive and put an end to some of the obstruction.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has been in London for six days, trying to carve out a difficult compromise with his UK counterpart David Frost and draw up a trade pact that can be ratified within weeks.
 "We are at the end of a marathon, probably past the 40 kilometre (25-mile) mark. But there's still a little way to go," Barnier adviser Stefaan de Rynck said, during a debate at the European Policy Centre.
 As the finish line nears, tempers were fraying in Brussels, with some of the EU's 27 member states \-- led by France and the Netherlands -- worried that Barnier would shake hands on something that in their view gives up too much ground to a country quitting the club.
 An EU diplomat insisted the Europeans remain united, but warned that it was clear that Barnier "was millimetres away from the red lines" he had been given.
 "I think it's quite clear that at this moment in time that we've reached a point where we are so close to the limits of our mandate, that we need a movement on the side of the UK if we want to strike a deal," he said.
 "I do not have the impression that we are hours away from a deal... what has to be bridged is still quite substantial," the diplomat added.
 Negotiators are working day and night to agree on a deal in time to be ratified before December 31, when Britain will no longer be bound by EU single market rules under the terms of a post-Brexit transition.
 A European source with close knowledge of the negotiations said the talks would continue on Thursday "and no doubt on Friday."
 "Everything could change at any moment," the source said, adding that the sense of urgency was "now understood in London".

Colorado’s roads can be notoriously vulnerable to weather conditions, particularly in the winter when snow, ice, wind and avalanches can compromise or cut off safe passage in a matter of minutes. While the Colorado Department of Transportation’s (CDOT) fleet of trusty plows is adept at treating and clearing roads around the clock, there is another tool in the quiver that stands at the ready. Perched high above mountain roadways throughout the state and along the 1-70 corridor are 30 different avalanche mitigation systems. The newest installation was recently completed on Highway 145 on the south side of Lizard Head Pass.
 “Colorado 145 and Lizard Head Pass is the alternate route for travelers heading north when the US 550 mountain corridor is closed for emergencies,” said CDOT Winter Operations Program Manager Jamie Yount. “This new avalanche mitigation system will help us keep (the highway) open more readily, offering a higher, more dependable level of service for motorists, particularly when avalanche conditions and cycles are occurring in the San Juan Mountains during significant winter storm periods.”
 The project, which commenced in early August about a mile north of Rico and 20 miles south of Telluride, consisted of the installation of five towers on the high ridgeline above the highway. They are strategically positioned at known snow slide paths — the Peterson and the Yellow Springs slide paths — and will be used for remotely triggering avalanches in a controlled, planned manner. According to a recent CDOT news release, “remote systems have proven more reliable and safer for avalanche mitigation personnel to operate. The new system will also provide more efficient and swift avalanche control operations, making travel in the area safer for motorists.”
