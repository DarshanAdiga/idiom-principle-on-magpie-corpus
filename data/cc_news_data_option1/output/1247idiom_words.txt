Though perhaps he was occasionally a bit clumsy in his execution, Lee shepherded Taiwan’s transition into the modern free and open democratic society we all know today. This involved leading his own party, the Kuomintang, despite intense internal opposition. Lee later broke with the KMT and created his own party, but by then he was in retirement and less of a player than he had been during his twelve years as the island’s President.

I believe it is accurate to term Mr. Lee one of the leading founders of modern Taiwan. Taking his cue from his mentor, President Chiang Ching-kuo, Lee skillfully led Taiwan into the community of democratic nations. Taiwan’s successful democratization represented one of the earliest such transitions in the East Asian region. His unparalleled example of stepping down from the Presidency ended decades of “authoritarian rule until death” that had preceded him.

In sum, Lee Teng-hui is one of the key founders of today’s prosperous and democratic Taiwan, a country that is the marvel of observers throughout Asia and the world. I salute him for his unparalleled contributions to the modern and self-confident Taiwan of today!

Lee and I shared the Episcopalian faith, and I saw in him a devout and humble Christian who understood his obligation to both the secular and spiritual worlds. He often told me he hoped to preach again when he retired from politics. I suspect he did so, though I cannot document this assumption.

_Ambassador Stephen M. Young (ret.) lived in Kaohsiung as a boy over 50 years ago, and served in AIT four times: as a young consular officer (1981-’82), as a language student (1989-’90), as Deputy Director (1998-2001) and as Director (2006-’9). He visits often and writes regularly about Taiwan matters. Young was also US Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Consul General to Hong Kong during his 33-year career as a foreign service officer. He has a BA from Wesleyan University and a PhD from the University of Chicago._

We have now witnessed three successive heirs to the Lee tradition in Taiwan politics, from both major political parties. Chen Shui-bian, Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) and Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) all owe a debt to President Lee for the high example he set for democratic leadership in Taiwan.

Among my many interactions with President Lee, I think none was more dramatic than in the summer of 1998, when in an interview with a German newspaper, he spoke of a potential “state-to-state relationship” between Taiwan and the mainland. I was Acting Director of AIT at the time, and the storm this kicked up in China and Washington came as something of a surprise to many observers. Beijing, which had long been hostile to Lee, orchestrated a firestorm, suggesting this was nearly tantamount to an act of war. President Clinton in Washington, already engaged in a gradual post-Tiananmen rapprochement with the mainland, sent me stiff talking points to deliver.
