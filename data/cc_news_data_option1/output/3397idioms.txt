Sitting there, with the music playing, and the buzz of people enjoying their meals made me take a break from the outside world, and everything going on in it.
 It was like I was in a little bubble where all I had to focus on was good music and good food.
 Families, couples, young people, older people, people eating on their own like me, there were all walks of life in Five Guys which is one of the reasons it's so popular - there's no specific demographic.
 There were plenty of happy faces and full bellies as people enjoyed their lunches, which is always a good sign.
 If you're after something more casual then Five Guys is the way to go.
 No fancy airs and graces, nothing frilly, just good burgers, good fries, and great service.
 Five Guys is definitely up there on our list of burger places in Cambridge, and did us proud on National Burger Day.

Renee Jobst Anderson, age 73, passed away at home on August 24, 2020, surrounded in love by her family.      Renee grew up in the Los Angeles area and attended George Washington High School. She was a talented musician, mastering the violin at an early age which earned her a scholarship to Pepperdine University. She was also a pianist and often played at home for family. Renee found joy in numbers and worked in accounting for 30 years alongside David J. Cecy and his family. The friendships and memories Renee made there brought her much happiness, and the two families remain now and forever close. A competitive game player, her younger years were filled with late nights and full weekends playing pinochle with dear friends; and she was a fierce Scrabble player, reveling in her triple word scores and seven letter bonuses.      As a mom, Renee was actively involved in her daughters' lives. From baking for their classmates to volunteering in the classroom; from hauling her kids to various sports practices and events, to cheering them on as they played/raced - Renee was always there for her girls. As a grandma, her grandchildren were her pride and joy - cooking for and with them, reading to them, teaching them games - she cherished it all and will be dearly missed. Renee loved to travel. Prior to retirement, she and Warren hit the road in their RV as often as possible. In retirement, Renee greatly enjoyed cruising the world with Warren, sailing on 14 different ships with the longest trip being 60 days at sea around South America. She served as an officer at the Watsonville Elks Lodge, and prior to lockdowns due to COVID she looked forward to her monthly lunch with the good friends she'd met at Curves. In addition, the connections Renee had at Corralitos Community Church were an important part of her life.      She is survived by her husband of 47 years, Warren A. Anderson; her children Michelle (David) Olson of Corralitos, CA and Melissa (Glenn) Griffin of Madison, WI; her grandchildren Timothy Olson (28) of Monterey, Jacob Olson (24) of Watsonville, Lillian (20), Matthew (16), and Ruth Renee (13) Griffin of Madison, WI; her brothers Wayne of Watsonville and Russell of Hawaii. She will be further missed by her beloved nephew Tobias, her Aunt Lou, and her cousins Dan, Jeff, Greg, and Doug. She is preceded in death by her mother Eva Lorraine, her father Wesley Allen, her beloved Aunt Thelma, and her Uncle Glenn.      The family would like to thank MaryLou, Renee's loving caregiver from Visiting Angels, and the wonderful staff of Hospice of Santa Cruz County. Due to COVID restrictions, we are unable to hold a service at this time. Mehl's Colonial Chapel has been entrusted with the arrangements. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Corralitos Community Church or Hospice of Santa Cruz County.

My fries were absolutely piping hot, fresh from the fryer but they didn't look oily or greasy.
 Five Guys use peanut oil for their fries, and always advertise where their potatoes have come from that day - often somewhere local.
 The thing with Five Guys fries, is they taste like actual potatoes. I know that sounds weird, but when you compare the taste with other big names, they often just taste like crunchy, fried salt sticks.
 With Five Guys it feels more like a homemade chip in that you have a bit of flavour to it, and it tastes more like something you'd make with spuds form the supermarket (as well as a fancy fryer and top-secret recipe probably!)

I am a retired U.S. Postal Service employee, having worked for 25 years as a letter carrier, training specialist and manager, and postmaster in Erie and Crawford counties. I am writing to raise awareness about the devastating issues facing the U.S. Postal Service. Recent operational changes, including those made in Erie at the General Mail Facility (GMF), are resulting in substantial delays in the delivery of mail. Americans need the Postal Service performing at full capacity now more than ever.
   
 Americans rely on the Postal Service to deliver life-saving prescription medications, essential goods and communications. In some cases, delayed or denied delivery could force individuals to forgo critical medications and goods altogether. An interruption in service also means a delay in receiving and delivering absentee ballots, crucial during the pandemic.
   
 For seniors, especially those with preexisting medical conditions quarantining for safety, a trip to the pharmacy, store or polling site could unnecessarily expose them to greater risk of infection from COVID-19.
   
 Congressman Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania's 16th District knows firsthand what COVID-19 can do its victims, as he successfully fought the virus himself this past spring. A lot of our seniors don't have the same support system in place as Kelly to help them fight this virus -- let's not diminish the effectiveness of one of the tools they need to navigate through their (hopefully) recovery.
   
 I am asking everyone in Erie and Crawford counties, as well as Ashtabula County in Ohio, to join me in calling on U.S. Reps. Mike Kelly, Glenn Thompson, R-15th Dist. and Dave Joyce, of Ohio, R-14th Dist., to do right by the people who tirelessly work each day to ensure households and businesses receive timely delivery of mail and goods, often at a greater risk to their own health.
   
 Tell your congressman to preserve the Postal Service and provide emergency funding to keep it operating.

 Gnibus will serve this
   
 district better than Kelly
   
 Every election we voters elect representatives to Congress to represent us and to look after our district's needs. As things have gone, I believe we have the worst congressman in my lifetime in U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, R-16th Dist.
   
 He has not done anything for our poorest workers, who have not had a raise in the minimum wage in more than 12 years. He has voted more than 50 times to kill the Affordable Care Act with nothing to replace it with, and recently, his Butler car dealership business, Mike Kelly Automotive Group, received three loans, totaling between $450,000 and a little more than $1 million of our workers' tax dollars from the Paycheck Protection Plan.
   
 He is one of the biggest cheerleaders and enablers of this president, who lies daily, name-calls anyone who does not support his thinking, makes statements that are outrageous, dismisses scientific recommendations by experts while the COVID-19 pandemic rages in our country killing thousands of our citizens, and who tries to suppress voting by shutting down processing in our post offices.
   
 Kelly comes to town unannounced to meet with his donors, but will never have a face-to-face town hall meeting with the voters to answer our questions and to tell us why he always votes the party line.
   
 We now have a highly qualified candidate in Kristy Gnibus, who will replace Kelly and finally give us a representative who will work for our needs and respect the voters.
   
 New leadership in our congressional district has been a long time coming. Let's vote for ourselves and vote for Kristy Gnibus.

 Keep your eyes on the turmoil in the devastated cities that are run over by wild mobs who hate America. See the truth in their objections, their smashing and burning.
   
 See the truth of what actually needs to change -- the hearts of the human race. What use is it to have all of the world's goods and have a heart that is discontent, focused on evil and hatred?
   
 Please open your eye, America, before socialism, or worse, takes over our nation. We are one nation, under God with liberty and justice for all.

Cycling grandmother busted for doping by Colorado Springs-based USADA | David Ramsey
 Otto was obsessed with this exotic spot, so obsessed that his marriage to Boston artist Beatrice Farnham was doomed when they exchanged vows in the canyons. She wanted Otto to sleep at their cozy home. He wanted to sleep in a tent, as he had pre-marriage, among the canyons he so loved. She left Grand Junction a few weeks after their wedding ceremony. She never returned.
 "I tried hard to live his way, but I could not do it, I could not live with a man to whom even a cabin was an encumbrance," Farnham wrote after her return to the East Coast.
 Otto returned, fully, to his true love.
 “I’m going to stay and build trails and promote this place,” Otto wrote, “because it should be a national park.”
 He was and is correct. This monument deserves a promotion.

The new Gamescom trailer for Little Nightmares 2 introduces us to a new character along with some creepy new bosses to run away in terror from. Just from this trailer, I feel compelled to protect this poor, adorable boy wearing a paper bag from every horror he encounters.
 This horror platformer picks up right after the events of the first Little Nightmares, and has raincoat-wearing miniature hero, Six, on the run from an array of ghoulish giants trying to eat her and her new friend Mono. Mono is the boy with the paper bag over his head, and I do not want anything bad to happen to him.
 Players will take control of both Six and Mono as they run from severed hands, hide from massive creepy doll people, and solve some puzzles in an unsettling 2.5D world. Our reviewer Samuel liked the first game, back in 2017, calling it "an effective and frequently unsettling horror platformer."
 Little Nightmares 2 is coming to PC on February 11, 2021.

AUBURN, Ala. (WSFA) - Auburn University’s reentry testing results show there was a 4 percent positivity rate among students returning for classes this fall, the university announced Thursday.A total of 21,315 tests were given in the weeks leading up to the fall semester, and there were 859 positive results. This data includes tests up until Aug. 21.The university said the majority of those who tested positive were asymptomatic or exhibited “extremely mild conditions.” Many of the positive cases were students who weren’t on campus. The ones who were on campus were quarantined and isolated.Auburn University required the tests for students returning to campus this fall. They were offered for free through the state’s GuideSafe program.The university said the reentry testing data gives a good snapshot of the student population leading up to this semester, but it doesn’t reflect the current conditions.For the week of Aug. 15-21, the university received 207 new reports of COVID-19 cases not affiliated with the GuideSafe reentry testing. Of those new reports, five were employees and 202 were students.Auburn’s COVID-19 Health and Exposure webpage, which is updated weekly, offers the most current COVID-19 data as it is reported through the Auburn University Medical Clinic and self-reports.Tracking of additional COVID-19 cases will continue as they come in through the Auburn University Medical Clinic, the Alabama Department of Public Health and those in the campus community who fill out the university’s online self-report form.Bobby Woodard, senior vice president for Student Affairs, called on students to do their part to keep the numbers down.“COVID is truly a situation in which every individual’s actions count,” Woodard said. “If we are going to preserve on-campus education, we have to be all-in, both on and off campus. One night out in a crowd is not worth the potential consequences the entire campus will face if the virus continues to spread in our community. We must be vigilant in doing our part for the common good. This will not be forever.”Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News. All rights reserved.

 The standard Five Guys burger comes with two patties, but since it was lunchtime I restrained myself and went for the Little Burger option, which is a single patty.

Dentro del planteamiento de Bartomeu no entra en ningún momento la posibilidad de dar la carta de libertad al jugador ni negociar su traspaso. El dirigente prefiere marcharse antes que firmar el adiós de Messi. De este modo y si la justicia no dice lo contrario, la única vía de salida para Messi sería el pago de su cláusula, de 700 millones de euros. Una cifra totalmente fuera de mercado e inasumible por ningún club.

Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond, the VR-only World War 2 FPS from Titanfall and Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment, is still on track for a release before the end of the year—"holiday 2020" according to a new story trailer revealed at Gamescom today.
 The trailer shows lots of intense first-person combat in everything from tanks to planes to ships at sea. There are even Nazis on skis to shoot at. Check it out above.
 I got to try out an early build of Above and Beyond in VR about a year ago, back when you could go places and meet people and let them put things on your face. It's a full-length VR game, with 50-plus levels in a campaign that takes you all the way through World War 2. I found it pretty engaging at the time, with not just guns but plenty of physics objects to use against your enemies, from throwing knives to frying pans.
 Respawn has said there will be multiplayer modes, too, though we still haven't heard the full details. We expect to learn more at Oculus Connect—er, sorry, at _Facebook_ Connect, next month.

Several airports, including in Rome, Milan and Naples, as well as seaports now test travelers as soon as they disembark from aircraft or ferries. Most of those infected lately are in their 30s, 20s or teens, and often are asymptomatic. Still the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients has been creeping upward. A month ago, the number of hospitalized patients had dipped to just over 700. In contrast, early in Italy's devastating outbreak, some 30,000 patients were hospitalized nationwide on any given day. On Thursday, 76 additional persons needed hospitalization, for a total of 1,131 non-intensive care patients in Italian hospitals. Italy's known death toll increased by five, to a total of 35,463.

GREEN BAY — The conversations began on Wednesday night.
 Matt LaFleur had watched as two other Wisconsin-based professional sports teams — the Milwaukee Bucks, who’d refused to take the floor for their NBA playoff game against the Orlando Magic, and the Milwaukee Brewers, whose game against the Cincinnati Reds had been called off — make significant public statements through their decisions not to play their games in the wake of Sunday’s shooting of Jacob Blake by a Kenosha police officer.

The new Gamescom trailer for Little Nightmares 2 introduces us to a new character along with some creepy new bosses to run away in terror from. Just from this trailer, I feel compelled to protect this poor, adorable boy wearing a paper bag from every horror he encounters. This horror platformer picks up right after the events of the first Little Nightmares, and has raincoat-wearing miniature hero, Six, on the run from an array of ghoulish giants trying to eat her and her new friend Mono. Mono…
