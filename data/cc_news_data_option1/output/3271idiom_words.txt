“Killing is not there. If I say they should kill them, that’s the case, I didn’t talk about killing. Nana Akufo-Addo did not do anything so 20% of NPP will be voting for John Mahama how will you tell them they should kill them. We know that they will vote John Dramani Mahama 2020. We say the criminals who are going around taking ID card. NPP people should feel free because we know they will vote for John Mahama so we won’t kill them. NPP are those telling people that they will kill them but we NDC will not do that. We know that the government is not a good government so we know that 2020 20% of NPP will vote for the NDC”; Chief Azorka said.
