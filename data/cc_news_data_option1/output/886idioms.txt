Un capitano dal destino segnato che guida una ciurma nella bufera: in una metafora avventuristica e questo, in un certo senso, lo scenario di Pioli alla guida del Milan. La situazione che vive l'allenatore emiliano, secondo le ultime voci, e surreale e complicata. Pioli, infatti, e alla guida di una squadra che ha faticato a trovare certezze sul campo e che, al momento, vede sgretolarsi le poche sicurezze avute sin qui in societa dato il probabile addio di Boban e Maldini. La scelta dell'ex Lazio ad Ottobre, dopo l'esonero di Giampaolo, e figlia del pensiero di due dirigenti destinati a lasciare e che, con il loro addio forzato, segneranno anche la sua partenza dal Milan.
