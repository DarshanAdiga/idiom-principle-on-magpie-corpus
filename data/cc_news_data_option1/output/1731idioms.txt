“Where do we go from here?” he recalled asking the officers. “What side of history do you want to be on? Someone has to stand their ground. We’re on a slippery slope, and we might end up where we might not want to be.”
 He cited the 2nd Amendment and civil rights activist Rosa Parks, and in the end, the parties shook hands and the police departed.

Pressure to reopen parts of California continued to build over the weekend, with more rural counties vowing to ease stay-at-home restrictions and protesters marching against the _closure of Orange County beaches_ , a move intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
 Polls show most Californians _support stay-at-home rules_ , which have been credited with helping California avoid the massive death toll of New York and other hot spots, and fear that lifting them too soon could cause more outbreaks.
 But the social-distancing restrictions _have devastated the economy_ , and some parts of California that have not been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus are pushing _to get back in business_.
 Gov. Gavin Newsom said he understood the frustrations and suggested he would announce an easing of some rules as early as this week.

“You’d see guys toward the end of a game, maybe getting ready for their final at bat, double-back into the locker room to chug a beer to ‘re-kick the bean’ so they could step to the plate completely wired and focused and dialed in,” Darling recounted in his book, “Game 7, 1986: Failure and Triumph in the Biggest Game of My Life." “They had it down to a science, with precision timing.
 “They’d do that thing where you poke a hole in the can so the beer would flow shotgun-style. They’d time it so that they were due to hit third or fourth that inning, and in their minds that rush of beer would kind of jump-start the amphetamines and get back to how they were feeling early on in the game — pumped, jacked, good to go.”

"He brings all of the energy to any situation," Rachel told CNN. "I always say this, but Jake is the life of the party no matter what. I just thought he'd love to do that."
 Rachel said she decided to throw her own prom after reading friends' posts on social media expressing disappointment in their school's decision to cancel the event. Many had already bought beautiful dresses and now had no prom to wear them to.
 Still, Rachel was committed to making her prom a night to remember -- and that's exactly what she did.
 The teen, who documented the event on her YouTube channel, put on a dress, did her makeup and even helped Jake into a tuxedo. Then they went outside to take photos, like most prom dates do, and even FaceTimed family members who couldn't be there due to social distancing measures.
