The university also plans to resume in-person instruction for the fall semester on Aug. 24. However, some classes will exclusively take place online. The university is working to reduce density in courses and to provide online learning for students with health concerns. After fall break, all classes will be online.
 “The public health experts on our own team and across the country are united in urging people to limit travel to contain the spread of COVID-19,” McConnell wrote. “In light of this guidance, it would be irresponsible to ask our community members to return to campus after traveling for Fall Break.”
 The residence halls will remain open for students who need to return to campus after fall break, and the university intends to institute contact tracing to track infections.

I have no faith in my own ability to prognosticate, I’m afraid. I lack Marc’s confidence, conviction, and insight. Instead, I have slowly adapted my own stock-picking strategy to keep up with the fact that value stocks have been underperforming, and I have been trying to focus on what has worked on Wall Street over the past ten to twelve years rather than what worked in other time periods. With the coming regime change, I may be caught flatfooted.
 But at least I can say this: the regime that just ended has been very good to me, despite the fact that I’ve been investing in cheap microcaps while the regime has favored expensive megacaps. That regime allowed me to grow my portfolio by about 30% a year. Will the next? Only time will tell.

MONTCLAIR, N.J. (AP) - Joe Biden could seize the number of delegates needed to formally clinch the Democrats’ presidential nomination on Tuesday as seven states and the District of Columbia push through a pandemic and exploding racial tensions to host the largest slate of primary elections in almost three months.Voters will be asked to navigate curfews, health concerns and a sharp increase in mail balloting as elections take place from Maryland to Montana. Four states were originally scheduled to vote in April but delayed their contests because of the coronavirus outbreak. Pennsylvania offers the day's biggest trove of delegates and represents a high-profile test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in one of the most important general election battlegrounds."We think we're prepared," said state Democratic Party Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills. "Thank goodness we have the opportunity of working this out in the primary because we don't know where we'll be with the pandemic in November."Biden needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to clinch the nomination, but his role as his party's clear presidential nominee is not in danger should he fall short. With a dominant showing on Super Tuesday in early March, the former vice president pushed out all his major opponents. He will almost certainly secure the needed delegates later in the month if necessary.Still, Tuesday offers a historic opportunity for the 77-year-old Democrat, who is waging his third presidential campaign and who hopes to amass as many delegates as possible to show strength before going up against President Donald Trump. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway."People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders," Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party's platform and rules. The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining, but he must still win over skeptical activists from his party's far-left flank who worry he's too close to the political establishment. Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation.The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day. At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests following the killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes.Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a 7 p.m. curfew, though voting places will be open until 8 p.m. Voting has been deemed essential, and city officials say voters will not be subject to arrest if they cast ballots during the curfew. It's much the same in Philadelphia, where officials have promised that voters would not be arrested should their city's 6 p.m. curfew be extended for a fourth consecutive night. "We are in unique times and voting is a unique challenge for people," said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday "to see how well it works, where issues are, and where obstacles have been put in place."Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines. Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. An eighth state holding primary elections, Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and focused on other offices.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

MUMBAI — A video featuring Wajid Khan started trending June 1, shortly after the singer-composers shocking death in the early hours the same day.
 The video, which went viral by afternoon, has Wajid singing the song "Hud Hud Dabangg" from his hospital bed. In the clip, the composer is unrecognizable, having shaved off his trademark beard. He tends to run short of breath after a point while singing at a stretch.
 Referring to his brother and professional partner Sajid, Wajid says in in Hindi, "Sajid bhai ke liye toh ek hi gana gaoonga main (I can only sing one song for Sajid bhai)" before he starts singing various versions of the popular "Dabangg" theme song with gusto.
 Talking about late Wajid Khan, singer Mamta Sharma who has sang multiple songs for the composer duo like "Anarkali Disco Chali", "Fevicol Se", "Pandeyji Seeti" and "Munna Badnaam Hua", told IANS: "Wajid Bhai would always feel his music. He never composed music just for the sake of composing it. He would always create music which he would feel deep inside. Most of the times he used live musicians, because he believed that live musicians bring life and soul in a song."

Mike Hahn with the Colorado State Patrol said there were "multiple breaches" into the state Capitol but that the patrol was able to "hold the line."
 Speaker of the House KC Becker said someone threw a rock through her office window and through the office window of Chief House Clerk Robin Jones.
 A window in the governor's office also was damaged, as was a window in his chief of staff's office. Lee said he believed protesters used slingshots to reach those upper windows.
 Elevators and windows at the state parking garage at Lincoln Street and 14th Avenue also were damaged.
 The damage extends to statues all over the complex and in Lincoln Park. Graffiti covered the Civil War statue in front of the Capitol, the Joe Martinez statue (a tribute to Colorado's first Congressional Medal of Honor winner), the Liberty Bell facsimile and the Colorado Veterans Memorial.
 The fencing around the veterans' memorial was torn down and used by protesters on Saturday in an attempt to block off police.
 There's massive graffiti everywhere, he said, although about 200 "peaceful protesters" came to Lincoln Park to help the city clean it up this morning.
 At the department of human services building, 1575 Sherman St., all the front doors were shattered and protesters got into the building. They shattered an interior door but took off as state patrol was coming, Lee said.
 The fence in front of the department of education was hit by a car and is now bent. Lee wasn't sure if that was part of the protest or an accident.
 Lee said that contractors will be arriving Tuesday to tour the complex and provide "a ballpark estimate" on the cost of repairs by the end of next week.

MANY sporting clubs across the region will remain closed despite recently eased restrictions allowing non-contact community sport.
 Stage two of the state’s plan to ease restrictions was moved forward to June 1 and allows gatherings of up to 20 people at a range of venues and will include non-contact indoor and outdoor community sport.
 Emerald Academy of Dance director Jane Davis said she was excited to welcome all the young dancers back to the studio.
 The dance studio has been operating online while coronavirus restrictions have been in place, although Ms Davis said the students had been getting tired of the reduced social interactions.
 “We have been online at reduced capacity with the kids and they’ve been getting really weary with no face-to-face contact,” she said.
 “But to some degree it has been really good for us because the students have had access to a lot of teachers outside of Emerald.”
 Ms Davis said the students had also been enrolled into an online 16-week program based in Melbourne, which they wouldn’t have access to otherwise.
 The Emerald-based dance company will reopen on Monday, June 8, abiding by coronavirus health and hygiene requirements.
 Classes will be limited to 20 people, including teachers, which Ms Davis said was similar to the club’s usual numbers.
 “It will be nice to have them all back,” she said.
 While some clubs are eager to reopen as soon as possible, it hasn’t been feasible for others.
 Clermont Netball Association president Kirsty Appleton said the announcement didn’t change anything at the club, that was still trying to meet all other coronavirus requirements, including having a safety co-ordinator.
 “For small community clubs, where you’re already short on staff, it makes it difficult,” she said.
 Ms Appleton said the club was planning to open in line with Stage 3 of the Road map to Recovery to allow more players but would only reopen if there was enough community interest.
 Players are still required to pay full season fees for insurance purposes, even though they will only play a half season without the guarantee of inter- town competitions.
 “We’re really heavily dependant on expressions of interest and if we have that interest we will definitely do what we can to make that happen,” Ms Appleton said.
 “(The eased restrictions) are great but at the same time there’s still so many restrictions in place and unknowns.”
 She said summer sports would probably be most excited, with the potential to host a full season later in the year.
 Many residents, business owners and sporting groups were excited to hear the news, although Dysart’s CQ Dance Academy owner Katie Griffiths wished they were given more notice.
 The dance studio will also hold off reopening until Term 3 to make sure everything is up to scratch and in line with government and health requirements.
 “We have to restructure all the classes, mark out the flooring, but it has to be viable,” she said.
 “It was just thrown upon us and it’s frustrating more than anything because we’ve been planning towards Term 3.”
 Ms Griffiths said she was looking forward to having students dancing again and would work towards to the end of year concert, if it’s allowed to go ahead.
 “It will be good if we can and sad if we can’t because that’s what they all look forward to,” she said.
 The golf clubs will continue operating, Emerald Archery Club won’t open for the public until at least next month, Emerald Bowls Club and Blackwater Junior Motorcross Club committees will meet this week to discuss plans of reopening.
