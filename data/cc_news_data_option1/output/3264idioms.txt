 Although McCoy will now land on injured reserve, it doesn't mean he'll be absent from the team. It's expected he'll remain present and accounted for in the capacity of a mentor and aid to coaches, much like Travis Frederick was in 2018 when the now-retired All-Pro was sidelined due to his battle with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Frederick was exceedingly active that season in helping the Cowboys offensive line prepare on a weekly basis, and while the two ailments are vastly different, McCoy will look to have a similar impact on the sideline and in the meeting room.
 So when McCarthy was asked if McCoy would stick around to help out in Year 1 of his three-year deal, despite being on crutches, the coach wasn't ambivalent in his reply.
 "Yes, I do," he said of his newly-acquired pass rusher. "Actually Gerald, that was part of our conversation -- he expressed not only a desire to be here and be part of what we've started here. Obviously he's very comfortable and this is where he wants to be. That's exactly what he communicated to me."

After five straight Finals appearances from 2015 to 2019, Golden State Warriors star guard Steph Curry became accustomed to deep playoff runs. This year, however, injury issues plagued Curry and the Warriors. Klay Thompson missed the entire season due to a torn ACL that he suffered during last year's Finals, and Curry was limited to just five total games after breaking his hand in October. In turn, the Warriors failed to qualify for postseason play for the first time since 2012.
 Thus, while the league is finishing out the 2019-20 season on an extremely unique stage in the Orlando bubble, Curry and his Warriors teammates are home, watching the games on television. After being at the center of the action for so long, being on the outside of the playoff picture this year was a tough transition for Curry, who admitted that he initially felt a bit left out when the season restarted last month.
 "Obviously I was happy to see basketball back on TV, but that first week I had major FOMO [fear of missing out]," Curry said in an interview with Marc Stein of the _New York Times_. "Once you see [LeBron James] and [Kawhi Leonard] and [Paul George] go at it, and you remember how much fun it is to play in those types of games and that kind of level, you miss it badly,"

Earlier this offseason, Dalvin Cook was reportedly set to hold out of training camp in the absence of a new contract from the Minnesota Vikings. Now, days into padded practice at camp, the Vikings are doing the holding out for him. NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday that Minnesota has been keeping Cook out of many team drills while the two sides negotiate a long-term deal.
 "This situation has to come to a head soon," Pelissero said. "Either Cook is going to become one of the higher-paid running backs in the NFL on a fair, long-term deal with the Vikings, or they're eventually going to re-integrate him into practice and he will be playing out the final year of his rookie contract."
 Cook has already indicated he'll practice and play this season even without an extension to his rookie deal, which expires after 2020, telling reporters he's "full go" at camp, isn't focused on negotiations and wants to remain in Minnesota. This echoes the general optimism that's surrounded contract talks since March, when the Vikings reportedly first engaged the star running back about a new deal. Even after the reported threat of a Cook holdout, which itself was unlikely because of CBA rules that would've penalized the RB for his absence, all signs pointed to Minnesota making Cook one of the game's highest-paid at his position.

The Center Square) – Gov. Mike DeWine has told state employees they can work from home at least until January 2021, drawing criticsm from a fellow Republican.
 “Delaying an anticipated office return date until no sooner than January will give us more time to prepare for those who will eventually return to an office setting, and better insight into the anticipated trajectory of the virus in the fall and winter months,” Columbus Business First quoted DeWine as saying in a message to all 50,000 state employees. “My team will continue its work behind the scenes to plan for your safe return.”
 DeWine's message drew condemnation from at least one lawmaker in his own party.
 “The only thing uncertain and precarious is if ‘we the people’ will ever rid ourselves of these draconian measures and have our liberty and freedom restored,” state Rep. Nino Vitale, R-Urbana, said on Facebook. “It seems clear now that DeWine has issued his order to state employees, he will continue to oppress the people of Ohio well into the new year and beyond.”
 A spokesman for DeWine did not immediately respond to a request for more information.
 On Tuesday, the state said Ohio had recorded 109,062 total COVID-19 cases and 3,832 total deaths from the virus. Last week, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) District 1199 called on DeWine to allow state employees to continue to work from home amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Last month, DeWine issued a new order requiring Ohioans to wear a mask while in public to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Earlier this month, the Ohio Department of Health said it would issue an order to require K-12 students to wear face masks while at school.

The quarterback battle in New England waged forward on Tuesday as the Patriots held their second full-padded practice of training camp. Of course, this gives us a bit more insight as to who may have the edge in eventually claiming the spot that Tom Brady held for 20 years under center when the regular season kicks off in a few weeks. According to those on the scene in Foxborough on Tuesday, this day belonged to Cam Newton.
 The former league MVP, who is entering his first season with the Patriots after signing a one-year deal with the club in July, completed nine of his 12 passes during team drills, according to The Athletic's Jeff Howe, and two of his misses were due to drops, making it an even more efficient day than those stats suggest. His one true incompletion was an overthrow of Damiere Byrd, who he had deep over the middle of the field. While that may be his lone blemish, it does provide some promise that his arm strength is in good form after dealing with a shoulder injury over the last few seasons.
 As Bill Belichick highlighted on Monday, Newton getting caught up to speed with New England's playbook and terminology will be something that needs to evolve quickly for him to secure the starting job. Michael Giardi of the NFL Network sensed that Newton was still a bit delayed in his processing which caused a couple of no throws during the session.

As for Stidham, the second-year quarterback has seen better days, completing eight of his 11 throws with three interceptions, per Howe. On a positive side, Mike Reiss of ESPN notes that Stidham did have one of the best throws of the day -- a sideline pass to Damiere Brydd during 11-on-11 drills. Hoyer, meanwhile, has seemingly been the most consistent of the bunch, which makes sense considering his familiarity in the system, only missing two of his 11 throws during Tuesday's practice.
 With two full-padded practices and 12 team periods in the books, it's still a dead heat as to who'll ultimately win the starting job, with no quarterback really separating himself just yet. Howe reports that Stidham has started the rotations five times throughout these two practices, while Newton has started four times. Hoyer comes up the rear being the first quarterback to begin drills three times thus far.

In the pivotal swing state of Ohio, Attorney General Dave Yost pleaded with Trump to postpone any needed changes to the Postal Service until after Election Day. GOP Sen. Rob Portman and other Republicans in Ohio's congressional delegation urged DeJoy to "ensure timely and accurate delivery of election-related materials."
 The crisis at the Postal Service has erupted as a major election year issue as DeJoy, a Trump ally who took control of the agency in June, has swiftly engineered cuts and operational changes that are disrupting mail delivery operations and raising alarms among workers.
 At the White House, Trump leveled fresh assaults Tuesday on mail-in voting and universal ballots. More Americans than ever are expected to choose to vote absentee this year instead of risking health concerns by voting at polling places during the coronavirus outbreak.
 "You can't have millions and millions of ballots sent all over the place, sent to people that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent everywhere," Trump told reporters.
 "This isn't games and you have to get it right," Trump said.
 Trump made clear last week that he was blocking $25 billion emergency aid to the Postal Service, acknowledging he wanted to curtail election mail operations, as well as a Democratic proposal to provide $3.6 billion in additional election money to the states to help process an expected surge of mail-in ballots.
 Congress is not in session but Speaker Nancy Pelosi is calling the House back to Washington over the crisis at the Postal Service, setting up a political showdown amid growing concerns that the Trump White House is trying to undermine the agency ahead of the election.
 The House is expected to vote Saturday on legislation that would prohibit changes at the agency. The package will also include $25 billion to shore up the Postal Service, which faces continued financial losses.
 DeJoy and the head of the Postal Service board of governors are also set to testify Monday in the House.
 "We have to save the Post Office from the President now," Pelosi said late Monday on MSNBC.
 The top Democrat on the Homeland Security panel seeking DeJoy's testimony, Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, called the Postal Service "a lifeline" to Americans.
 "We must ensure they can continue to count on dependable and timely delivery," said Peters.
 The Postal Service is among the nation's oldest and more popular institutions, strained in recent years by declines first-class and business mail, but now hit with new challenges during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump routinely criticizes its business model, but the financial outlook is far more complex, and includes an unusual requirement to pre-fund retiree health benefits that advocates in Congress want to undo.
