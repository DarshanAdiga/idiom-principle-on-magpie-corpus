Ravi Zacharias's story has been an inspiration to millions of people. On a bed of suicide at 17, void of needing, emptied of hope, he opened a Bible and he read the words that are now displayed on the wall outside this church: "Because I live, you shall live also." And lying on that hospital bed, he opened his heart and his life to Jesus Christ, now to leave no stone unturned in his pursuit of the truth. And, that, he surely did.

NEW YORK - Lady Gaga torna agli inizi. Il suo nuovo album 'Chromatica', il sesto della sua carriera, è un inno alla dance-pop music proprio come quando nel 2009 balzò in vetta alle classifiche con il singolo 'Just Dance'. "Ho fatto di nuovo un album dance - ha detto - e questa pista da ballo è mia, me la sono meritata". L'uscita dell'album è stato annunciata dalla stessa Gaga con un post su Instagram con lei che balla da casa sulle note del brano '911' (In Usa in numero per le chiamate di emergenza, ndr).   Chromatica', previsto inizialmente per il 10 aprile ma rimandato a causa della pandemia, segue 'Joanne' nel 2016, oltre ad essere una pure celebrazione del pop è anche un album provocatorio che apre le porte di un'utopia fittizia dove va dentro tutto, tutto è accettato. Un assaggio dell'album era già arrivato con il singolo 'Stupid Love' e nel video Lady Gaga appare come un'eroina extra terreste tutta in rosa. Non a caso il testo della canzone si apre dicendo che il 'mondo marcisce nei conflitti e molte tribù combattono tra loro per il potere'.   Tra queste tribù c'è quella guidata da Gaga, 'the kindness punk' (il punk della gentilezza, ndr) che invece si batte per la pace.   Sempre la popstar ha spiegato che Chromatica va visto sia come un luogo inclusivo dove si mischiano suoni e colori sia come uno stato mentale aperto a tutti. "Non voglio sapere - ha detto - se ho mai fato un album che non sia alla maniera di Chromatica. Intendo che il modo in cui la penso è parte della mia musica, è il modo in cui mi esprimo, sia letteralmente che in modo astratto".   Prima del gran debutto dell'album, Lady Gaga è uscita con diversi brani e anche collaborazioni eccellenti. Tra queste quella con Ariana Grande in 'Rain on Me', 'Sine From Above' con Elton John e una traccia con il gruppo al femminile coreano Blackpink. Ma l'album affronta anche temi seri come la violenza sessuale o gli abusi di vario genere., di cui lei stessa è stata vittima. 'Fun Tonight' parla della rottura di una relazione tossica, in 'Plastic Doll' Gaga dice, 'Non sono un giocattolo per un ragazzo vero'.   Chromatica è per Lady Gaga anche un album della 'guarigione'.   Mentre lavorava alle canzoni si è liberata di tutto il dolore e la pena che ha non scandito il suo passato. "Non devo più sentire dolore - ha detto ancora - può solo essere parte di me e io posso andare avanti". (ANSA)

San Francisco edge rusher Dee Ford had an “extensive cleanup” operation for the tendinitis in his left knee that limited his effectiveness in his first season with the 49ers.
 Ford said Friday that Dr. James Andrews performed the operation a few weeks after San Francisco lost the Super Bowl and that he feels in much better condition heading into his second year with the Niners after playing with what he described as a “blown tire” for most of last season.
 “I’m confident moving forward,” Ford said. “I feel great right now. I’m able to actually explode off of this knee. Thinking back on it, I can’t believe I played a whole season on it. We knew at the end of the day, what we had to do, had to be surgical. But I didn’t want to miss the season. We had too much going on. I didn’t want to miss that. It’s in the bag now. I’m confident in that.”
 Ford was a key acquisition last season for the Niners, who traded a second- round pick to Kansas City for the edge rusher and then gave him a five-year, $85 million contract.
 Ford missed most of his first training camp with the Niners after having an injection in the knee. He returned to play 40 snaps in the opener but hurt the knee again in Week 2 at Cincinnati and didn’t play more than 26 snaps again in a game until the postseason.
 He played only four snaps the final six games of the regular season because of a hamstring injury.

Being a parent of twins can be challenging enough, but being a parent of high school graduating twins in the midst of a global pandemic creates an even bigger challenge: The pain of missing out on end-of-year festivities is doubled.
 Carolyn Macek is the mother of Somerset Berkley Regional High School seniors Austin and Ashley Macek. Both Austin and Ashley are passionate about sports, as Austin is the captain of the soccer team, basketball team, and tennis team, and Ashley is the captain of the cheerleading and indoor and outdoor track teams. Both are very talented and have been successful in their athletics, and are taking their talents to the collegiate level. Austin is playing basketball at UMass Dartmouth and majoring in business management and Ashley will be competing on the track and field team at Merrimack College while majoring in nursing.
 Macek said the cancellation of their senior spring sports season was tough for both children, but it was especially disappointing for Ashley. "She had been working extremely hard and was ready to excel in outdoor track again this season. Being her senior year, and her main sport was canceled was just crushing," Carolyn Macek said.
 She also recognized the struggle for her children to rapidly adjust their busy lifestyles to a life filled with isolation and boredom.
 "Just having to adjust and not knowing what to do with themselves, as they are used to being so busy, is a challenge in and of itself," Carolyn Macek said.
 The adjustment to online learning has had its share of struggles, too, she explained.
 "They have always been in the classroom with a teacher, having the luxury of asking questions and seeking personal help if needed," Carolyn Macek said. "Now suddenly trying to learn things by themselves, keep on task, and a schedule while at home."
 One of the biggest struggles of a graduating senior this year is losing out on end of the year events such as graduation and prom.
 "They missed out on so many end-of-year events that you can just never get back," Carolyn Macek said. "Never mind that overall feeling of satisfaction of completing your last courses after 12 years of school and celebrating with friends."
 Seeing children upset is also difficult on parents. "As a parent, you never want your child to hurt and want to do anything to make them feel better. In this case, I have never felt more helpless," Carolyn Macek said.
 Although it is easy for people to become overwhelmed by all the negatives in times like these, Macek does her best to focus on the positives. Macek enjoys the extra time with her family this situation has created, as there has been time for more family dinners, walks, and movie nights in the Macek household. When talking about the positives of this situation, she said " I definitely would like to maintain more of the togetherness once things get back to the new normal."
 When asked what advice she would give to other parents of graduating seniors, Macek said to focus on the positives and make the best out of the situations that are given to us. "Just as I have told my kids numerous times that having a strong mind is just as important as a strong body. We can't let this bring our families down," she said.
 Kara Magoni also is the mother of SBRHS senior twins, who has had to witness the pain this pandemic has caused for her children - a pain that other parents have seen, but for Kara Magoni, it's times two.
 "They have had to roll with the punches and make the best of a very shocking and unexpected situation," said Kara Magoni, of the struggles twins Brandon and Maisy have had to face.
 Brandon was a member of the ice hockey and golf teams at SBRHS and will be attending UMass Boston in the fall. Maisey will be attending Suffolk University pursuing pre-law.
 Maisy is the president of the DECA business club, and was planning on going to Nashville for the International DECA competition, but the competition was canceled because of Coronavirus restrictions. Her senior tennis season was also canceled because of COVID-19.
 "That's their whole life right now... this was their time to shine... this should have been their senior spring sports season, their time to be the kings of the school," she said.
 Kara Magoni feels very sympathetic for her children and the entire class of 2020 and disagrees with the notion that it's "not a big deal."
 "I believe most parents have tried to keep everything in perspective for their families. Meaning everyone's health is what is most important, but that doesn't make what they are missing out on unimportant. I don't like when it is minimized as a small blip in their lives," she said.
 But Kara Magoni has nothing but praise for the Class of 2020 and how they've adapted to the restrictions placed on them.
 "From this Mom to the Class of 2020, I say you are bonded for life as the class that made the best out of a bad situation!" she said. "It has prepared you to be prepared for the unexpected. ... Congratulations, go do great things."

There is also the large social justice dimension to the peak. Peak commuters are far more affluent on average than all-day travelers, because higher wage jobs are more likely to be “nine to five” while lower wage workers, predominantly in retail and services, are more likely to be needed around the clock. So a decline in peaking could help sustain services that support lower wage people — and remember, these are people whose work everyone depends on.

Noah Hanson, who was one of the teens inside the car at the time, told BuzzFeed News that the other officer had aimed his gun at them, but did not recall if Chauvin also had his gun out.
 Hanson, 23, said the other officer had his gun “pointed directly at my face from two feet away.”
 Tesla Petersen, 24, who was driving the car at the time, told BuzzFeed News that she did not remember if either of the officers had their guns out.
 All three of them recalled that the officers had pulled up behind the car without any lights or sirens on and had shouted at the teens to put their hands up in the air.
    Hanson said he thought it would've been clear to the officers what had happened after he and his friends told them that they were just Nerf guns.
 “They saw the Nerf guns on our laps,” Hanson said, but added that the officers continued to be “very suspicious.”
 Bergh said the officers confiscated the Nerf guns in their laps and in the trunk of the car.
 When one of the teens admitted to the officers that he was the one who had shot the Nerf gun that may have hit a passerby, Hanson, Bergh, and Petersen said the officers took their friend to their squad car and “detained him” for a while.
 “That friend later told us that in the squad car he was verbally berated further, being told that he was a worthless piece of shit who is soon going to have a rap sheet a mile long,” Bergh said.      One of the officers told the teens that “we’d all be 18 by the end of the year, meaning we can all go to ‘big boy jail,’” Bergh recalled.
 He said the officers finally released their friend “after what seemed like an eternity” and returned their Nerf guns.
 BuzzFeed News is awaiting a comment from the friend who was questioned by the two officers.
 Bergh said his mother had witnessed the entire incident from inside the house and when she deemed it safe to come out, she asked the officers why they had acted so aggressively.
 “They told her it was because we had been trying to elude them,” Bergh said. “How could we be trying to elude them if we didn’t know they were following us, since they didn’t use their siren?”
 Hanson said he was “terrified” when the other officer had pointed a gun to his face.      He said that the officers “just wouldn’t listen to reason” and made it seem like that was “just the way it has to be” when the teens questioned him about why the officers were grilling their friend.
 Bergh said the officers included the word “fuck” with every command they gave the teens during the encounter.
 “‘Put your fucking hands in the air,’ ‘get back in the fucking car,’ ‘don’t fucking move,’” Bergh said.
 The three friends told BuzzFeed News that the officers did not physically harm them or threaten them, “aside from the inherent threat implied by aiming guns at us,” Bergh added.
 A few days after the incident, Bergh said he filed an online complaint against both officers with the Minneapolis Police Department, describing the way they had been treated.
 He said a few days after filing the complaint, someone from the department called him to ask for a few more details about the incident.
 On July 24, 2013, he received an email response from a police sergeant that did not include details about whether either officer had been disciplined.

As it happened, Yale was disappointed by Kurnub: the shiny pools he had seen from a distance turned out to be water with iron deposits glistening in the sun. Nevertheless, he concluded from rock samples and borings that oil might be discovered there, though not in commercial quantities. In the minds of Socony executives, driven by a desire to gain a foothold in the region, that was good enough reason to proceed.      They purchased a 25-year concession and extended their interests in Palestine. The company went on to invest considerable resources in the Kurnub project, spending some $250,000 (about $6 million today) in buying and shipping equipment, building a 30-km road and setting up a camp in the desert as a prelude to drilling for oil. Meanwhile, the British authorities looked on with mounting alarm. Lawrence had confirmed Socony’s interest in Kurnub, causing his superiors to redouble their efforts to block the American effort. When World War I intervened, the Ottoman authorities requisitioned Socony’s shipment of trucks and the British diverted the company’s pipes and drilling equipment to Egypt, where they were promptly impounded.      The chaotic Kurnub project would probably have failed anyway but, in the longer run, Socony could at least claim to have established a presence in the Middle East. On paper, its credentials were compelling – when the war broke out, the company had obtained concessions for seven plots in Palestine and another 60 were in various stages of negotiation. However, by the end of the conflict, the Ottomans had departed, the area was under British military occupation and the company was back to square one.

Stylist Samantha McCormick at Salon Jaylee in Rolling Acres loves that her regulars are back. She was thinking about them and hoping they were staying safe during the stay-at-home order.
 “I have missed lot of the customers, and I know they are all slowly trickling in and when you don’t have all of the customers you’re used to there are certain ones that stick out in your head and you kind of worry about them,” she said.
 She has seen some of them come back in already, and it’s been a joy for her to connect with them again.
 It’s been a longer time since her fellow stylist Sarah Antonovich has seen her regulars.
 Salon Jaylee closed in early April, but Antonovich has been out since March 20.
 She felt good seeing familiar faces again since returning.
 “We had a lot of catching up to do and discussed what we did over quarantine, and it was nice,” Antonovich said. “It was nice seeing everybody doing good.”
 At Color Me Hair Studio, located in Buffalo Ridge Plaza, staff have welcomed their old clients and new clients with open arms.
 “We’re glad to be back open and the customers have been ecstatic about us reopening,” said Cole Owen, co-owner of the location with his wife, Jennifer.

One note: The app seems to drain your phone’s battery life quickly, to the tune of about ten percent on an iPhone 7 Plus in the two minutes it takes to brush my teeth. That said, Snapchat has a similar effect on my phone, so if Snapchat drains your phone’s battery quickly, you’ll probably have the same issue with the Colgate Magik app.
 ## Conclusions
 For $17.99, the Colgate Magik turns a necessary chore into a fun game kids will enjoy. I have a young niece and nephew who are obsessed with mobile games and Snapchat’s AR filters, so I know they'll love the masks you can earn here. And the Magik offers a similar experience to the $50 Philips Sonicare for Kids at a fraction of the price, so it's not nearly as much of an investment if you have multiple children. For its affordable price and fun gamified brushing experience, the Colgate Magik is our new Editors’ Choice. For adults, meanwhile, the Sonicare FlexCare Platinum Connected is a worthy investment, offering a useful app with guided brushing and a built-in timer.

As talented as he is, the cartoonish character neutralizes Carell's comedic gifts. The show's fleeting charms thus stem largely from the supporting players, and the series is cast to the hilt, with the late Fred Willard as Naird's dad, and Jane Lynch and Patrick Warburton as other military chiefs, just for starters.
 The latter's crude banter accounts for much of the best stuff in the show, which is a thin recommendation. And while there are some clever moments -- see an astronaut's attempt to coin a moon landing phrase that goes awry -- they're too widely spaced out, pardon the expression, over the 10 episodes.
 Beyond the challenge of meeting the administration's lofty goals for Space Force, Naird faces international complications, although it's painfully clear that the US government is, in this show, its own worst enemy.
 On paper, "Space Force" would seem to have a whole lot of factors working in its favor, from its talent manifest to the real-life parallels. Yet somewhere between the drawing board and its Netflix launch, it became its own worst enemy too.
  _"Space Force" premieres May 29 on Netflix._

SILVIS -- The John Deere Classic has decided to cancel what would have been its 50th anniversary as a PGA Tour event.
   
 Tournament director Clair Peterson says there were too many obstacles to overcome and too many risks from the COVID-19 pandemic that it made sense in the long run to not hold the tournament.
   
 "In Illinois, by the governor's mandate, we're not supposed to have gatherings of more than 50 people through the summer," Peterson said in a telephone interview. "And then you have the rest of its layers on top of that."
   
 The John Deere Classic in Silvis, Illinois, had been scheduled for July 9-12 at the TPC Deere Run. Dylan Frittelli of South Africa was the defending champion.
   
 It would have been the fifth tournament in the PGA Tour's revised schedule, which starts June 11-14 at Colonial. The tour has said no fans will be allowed for at least a month, meaning the John Deere Classic potentially would have been the first golf tournament that allowed spectators.
   
 Peterson said among the factors considered was which spectators would be allowed. From the more critical side of hospitality, he said one sponsor said 90% of its clients would not be coming.
   
 The tournament still plans a charitable donation. Peterson said the "Birdies for Charities" campaign is no longer tied only to the tournament but included flat donations. The John Deere Classic raised $13.8 million for more than 500 local charities.

That was a far cry from the previous season when Ford averaged nearly 63 defensive snaps a game for the Chiefs and had the second most of any front- seven player in the regular and postseason combined.
 Even after the surgery, the 29-year-old Ford knows he will still likely have to deal with the knee problems for the future.
 “Anytime you’re dealing with a chronic issue, you’re always on the clock,” he said. “I know exactly what I felt like last year. Doing the things that I’m doing now is like night and day. We’ll just play it by ear once everything gets going. We haven’t really had an offseason. No one’s really been in competition. It’s just hard to measure exactly where we’re at. We’re just going to keep taking it one day at a time and just keep getting this thing as strong as I could possibly get it so we can sack some quarterbacks.”
 Ford was able to do that last year when he was on the field. Despite being on the field for only 151 pass rush snaps, Ford still recorded 6 1/2 sacks for the highest rate in the league among players with at least 100 rushes.
 Ford also played a key role in transforming San Francisco’s defense by freeing up rookie Nick Bosa and Arik Armstead for pressure opportunities. The Niners finished tied for fifth in the league with 48 sacks and sixth with 27 takeaways a year after having only 37 sacks and generating a record-low seven takeaways.
 San Francisco’s pressure rate jumps from 22.7% when Ford isn’t on the field to 34.2% when he is playing, according to NFL NextGen stats, a sign of his importance.

Mexico shares its early geological history with the US Gulf of Mexico. Rifting initiated in the Middle Jurassic, providing the accommodation for deposition of the laterally extensive Louann and Campeche salt deposits and subsequent deposition of the world class Type II marine carbonate Tithonian source rock. The Chicxulub meteorite impact at the end of the Cretaceous is responsible for the carbonate fields to the east of Mexico. The Paleogene Laramide and Neogene Middle Miocene Chiapaneco compressional events resulted in rapid clastic deposition which influences the present day structural styles, such as salt- withdrawal mini-basins, salt diapirs and associated structures, compressional folds and listric faults.      In the early days of exploration, the focus was primarily on the Sureste Basin, also known as the Salina de Istmo, a proven prolific hydrocarbon province. It has produced in excess of 18 Bboe to date, mainly from Cretaceous carbonate reservoirs, and is known for the supergiant multi-billion barrel Cantarell oilfield, one of the largest anywhere in the world. Prospective resources are in the order of 13 Bbo and 6.5 Tcfg (CNH 2018). With current production focused mainly on the carbonates, the majority of the established clastic players entering the basin were drawn to the seismic ‘bright-spots’ in the supra-salt and salt flank plays with the poorly imaged sub-salt traps as a potential upside. Post-drill analysis of wells in the Miocene and Pliocene plays in the Sureste Basin revealed reservoir presence and seal as the main risks with a smaller percentage due to migration.      With wells few and far between and limited access to seismic angle stacks it was difficult to properly understand the amplitude responses especially in light of the fact that there are structural traps at similar depths and age without AVO responses. Having an understanding of the regional geology, including features such as tectonic history, petroleum systems expulsion and timing and gross depositional environment were important for prospect risking. To date, with ten other exploration wells drilled in the Sureste, we know that seismic ‘bright-spots’ are not always a reliable indicator of hydrocarbons, and wells which lack an AVO response were dry. The deepwater Sureste Basin (also known as the Campeche Basin), is a frontier experience testing unchartered territory, with the Norphlet and Wilcox plays (successful in the US Gulf of Mexico) targeted by wells in 2020, including Chibu-1, which is currently drilling (Figure 1). As further exploration wells are drilled in the basin, many of which target the clastic plays, the amplitude story will be unraveled and result in better drilling decisions.

All over the world, there is only one topic of conversation: Covid-19. The pandemic has resulted in some welcome shows of solidarity, as countries help each other out with medical assistance, urgent supplies and, importantly, research into vaccines and cures. It will undoubtedly have some positive long- term effects on the environment, as people appreciate the clear skies, low pollution and sounds of birdsong resulting from fewer planes and cars. Working from home and videoconferencing may well become the norm.      Like many industries, however, oil and gas has been severely hit by the fallout from the pandemic, with both demand and the price of oil slumping at a time of already worldwide surplus, exacerbated by additional pumping by Saudi Arabia and Russia as they follow their own competitive agendas. A number of E&P companies are reported to be cutting their CAPEX budgets for 2020 by around 20%, which will see many planned exploration projects, particularly in capital intensive areas like deepwater, mothballed for the foreseeable future. As a debt-heavy industry, the security for which is usually oil and gas reserves – now worth a lot less than they were just a few months ago – we can expect to see bankruptcies, in the service sector as well as E&P companies of all sizes. These will result in further job losses, in an industry that was only just beginning to climb out of the last slump. It is a miserable scenario.      Oil will recover, but it will take time. Because of the glut in supply, an increase in demand will not immediately result in rising prices – although the cheaper energy resulting from this lag in oil price increase could help world economies recover faster once the virus restrictions are lifted.      You will be pleased to hear that GEO ExPro will continue to publish both online and in hard copy, bringing you the information on exploration and technology in the upstream geosciences you need in order to be ready to bounce back when the crisis is over. The print magazine will be distributed to companies and subscribers worldwide as usual; many conferences and meetings have been postponed until later in the year, so we will also reserve copies of each edition to be distributed at those, whenever they may be held.      I would like to take this opportunity to send best wishes from the whole GEO ExPro team to anyone affected by the virus, either in health or in business, and look I forward with you to better times ahead.

 Not only does the XP18000 give you the most battery life per pound, but it also charges the fastest.
 Remember, charging times are a double-edged sword. Ideally, you want a nice slow charge so that your battery lasts more than a few hundred cycles. Fast charge times get you back away from the wall socket faster. But in the long run, they cut down on the health of the battery.
 Brunton implements the most conservative charging scheme, but this solution may make more sense if you are considering pairing it with one of the company's solar panels for a trickle charge.

Meatpacking plants that had to briefly close due to coronavirus outbreaks have been back up and running for weeks, but production backlogs are forcing farmers to euthanize thousands of hogs that can’t be processed, drawing complaints from animal welfare advocates.
 In Iowa, where nearly one-third of the nation's hogs are raised, the temporary closure of slaughterhouses led to a backup of about 600,000 pigs, state Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said. Those plants now are operating at about 80% capacity, but that's not enough to clear the backlog, and efforts to sell directly to consumers or process hogs at small slaughterhouses for donation to food banks aren't enough to avoid euthanizing some animals.

Our target is to deliver over-proportionate net income growth on the back of a sustainable operating margin expansion, which is very much in line with the guidance we normally given for this year, but as you know also the long-term guidance. And we'll continue to address issues when and if they come up. Europe is expected to return to growth by the end of this year and have a sustainable growth pattern into next year. And our supply shortages will be completely passed out, when we're done with the fourth quarter. And we'll have a normalized year next year. But, I just want to remind everybody that, Q1 to Q3, we will continue to see impact with it and we'll continue to see so.

With more than 77 committed exploration wells to be drilled in the next five years there will definitely be no slowing down of activity in Mexico. There is also the added advantage of being protected by the Production Sharing Contracts in a lower oil price environment. Plays will be de-risked and our understanding of the petroleum systems of the Mexican sector of the Gulf of Mexico will evolve rapidly. Billion-barrel fields will be few and far between due to confined trapping geometries, and it is thought that many discoveries are likely to contain recoverable reserves in the 50-250 MMboe range, requiring cluster developments. This could potentially lead to another wave of divestments and acquisitions in the next 3-5 years.      The energy reform can help reverse Mexico’s declining production and contribute toward the government achieving its goal of increasing production by 600,000 bopd by 2025. However, this will require greater collaboration between the international oil companies and the Mexican regulatory bodies in order to reduce the timeline from discovery to first oil without compromising technical and HSES standards. Clarity from the Mexican government on the future for foreign investment in the Mexican energy sector will be advantageous. The future could be a period in country’s history of increasing production and development of the Mexican economy as a whole, placing its people and the country on a global stage with other producing countries worldwide.

But here's the thing: These missteps won't matter in the long run. This isn't a Quibi situation, a fundamentally flawed service that has no place in the current media landscape. HBO Max is everything HBO already offered, plus exclusive shows and films from the Warner library. It's also the only place you can stream _Friends,_ _South Park_ __ and Studio Ghibli titles in the US. (Netflix nabbed Ghibli rights elsewhere, excluding Canada and Japan.) Even if you're not obsessed with HBO's shows, there's a wealth of content that makes a Max subscription worthwhile.
 You can think of HBO Max as WarnerMedia's $4 billion bet on the future. It's a unified streaming platform that does away with the confusing need for separate apps. (Previously, cable subscribers used HBO Go while digital-only customers used Now.) Instead of just competing with other premium networks like Showtime, HBO Max is taking aim at Disney+, Netflix and Hulu. And based on its existing content alone -- including cinephile-friendly Turner Classic Movies and geek-friendly Crunchyroll anime -- HBO Max is better poised than Apple TV+ to be a major streaming player.
 That's a good thing for AT&T;, as it needs to prove that its $85 billion Time Warner acquisition was actually a success. But there's still plenty of work ahead. For one, WarnerMedia needs to add Roku and Fire TV support as soon as possible. (Roku representatives wouldn't comment when asked about HBO Max.) It also needs 4K and HDR support, both of which are major quality advantages for Disney+ and Netflix. Lastly, HBO Max needs to be broadly available to every cable subscriber. Currently, it supports major providers like Charter, Verizon, Optimum and Cox.
 In the long run, HBO Max needs to step up its original content even further to justify the high $14.99 monthly cost. (For reference, Disney+ starts at $7 a month, while Netflix's standard monthly plan costs $13.) It's launching with six originals, like the romantic comedy _Love Life_ and an Elmo talk show, but none of it is exactly "must watch TV." The _Friends_ reunion could have been a big draw at launch, but that was delayed because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
 WarnerMedia had previously planned to launch 50 original shows during the first year, but it's unclear if that will actually happen. At this point, the service is banking heavily on HBO's already strong original lineup. But the network is still trying to find its next _Game of Thrones_ , and its more limited selection of shows can't compete with the deluge of _Netflix_ offerings.
 To be clear, I'm not excusing HBO Max's messy launch. WarnerMedia deserves all of the criticism it's getting, and it could have avoided plenty of headaches by securing partnerships ahead of time, and reaching out to its customers more. But the real story of HBO Max lies ahead, in a future where every media company will need a marquee service to stay relevant.

Hegerberg continues to sacrifice her place on Norway's national team.
 After taking the conscious decision to step away from the women's team in 2017 over the unfair treatment of her team compared to the men, Hegerberg has been buoyed by the US Women's National team, and particularly Megan Rapinoe, over their fight for equal pay.
 Earlier this month a federal judge threw out the unequal pay claims by the players, but allowed their allegations of discriminatory working conditions to go to trial. Attorneys for the players were asking to postpone the trial, which currently is scheduled for June 16.
 "The US team is filled with great characters," says the Norwegian. "Rapinoe has always had the guts to stand up for the sport and we really need figures like that. "She's taken a beating for us all at times, standing up for what she believes in, and we need that.
 "Being a women's footballer today -- it's impossible to not be standing for equality. That's why we need to be together on this in order to make a change for the future."
 However, the future is looking uncertain for women's football.
 In England, the remainder of the Women's Super League (WSL) and Championship seasons have been canceled because of the pandemic. In France, elite sport has been put on hold until September, while the women's European Championship has been pushed back to 2022.
 There are fears the ongoing pandemic could erode the strides women's football made during and following the hugely successful 2019 Women's World Cup.
 Hegerberg says she's particularly concerned about impact of playing behind closed doors. In Germany, the Frauen-Bundesliga will resume on May 29 with all matches played behind closed doors.
 "Our recognition comes from the number of people who attend our games," Hegerberg explains. "That was a really good trend before this crisis. It was one of the main goals, to get people to games, to draw more attention to women's football week in, week out. But being in a situation like this, it stops that good trend. We have to deal with [that] and keep pushing in order not to lose that positive development."
 As Hegerberg readies herself for a return to the sport, whenever that may be, she and her husband are grateful to finally be able to watch live football on TV.
 Hegerberg's husband is Thomas Rogne, who plays for Polish side Lech Poznan. She was recently able to join him in Poland after isolating in France -- although the return of Germany's Bundesliga meant a special occasion almost passed the pair by.
 "It's our one-year wedding anniversary!" she says.
 "We woke up and a family member told us and we were like, 'What?' We were more thinking about watching a game in the Bundesliga, so we had other things on our mind."

Trump's fury at China has escalated in recent weeks, as he has blamed Chinese officials for not doing more to contain the outbreak and warn the outside world of the danger. On Friday morning he tweeted simply "CHINA!"
 The announcement follows Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's statement earlier this week that Hong Kong was no longer sufficiently autonomous from mainland China to deserve separate treatment. Under the 1997 handover agreement with the United Kingdom, China agreed to preserve the former British colony's Democratic system for 50 years. Xi's decision to impose security legislation on Hong Kong directly rather than by working through the territory's local legislature may mark the collapse of that "one country, two systems" approach.
 The U.S. since 1992 has treated Hong Kong as a separate jurisdiction from China for the purposes of trade, customs and visa regulations.
 Caught in the middle of the deepening U.S.-China dispute are more than 1,350 U.S. corporations with offices in Hong Kong. The erosion of the city's freedoms, including an independent judiciary, threatens to turn one of the global economy's financial centers into just another Chinese city and calls into question the rationale for such a sizable commercial presence there.
 The Chinese National People's Congress, the country's rubber-stamp legislature, on Thursday approved a plan to impose national security legislation in Hong Kong. The move was denounced in a joint statement by the U.S., Canada, Australia and United Kingdom as in "direct conflict" with China's promises in 1997 when it regained sovereignty over the former British colony.
 "The United States may well have to do something the market doesn't like in light of its longer term interests," said Patrick Chovanec, economic adviser for Silvercrest Asset Management in New York. "But there is concern about whether the U.S. is in a spiral of escalation with China on several fronts."

Great Britain now controlled the most promising petroleum lands and American attempts to access the Middle East soon met the brick wall of imperial officialdom. In August 1918, the British military forced the Socony agent in Jerusalem to show them the company’s maps of their concessions in Palestine. This prompted Socony to make an official complaint to Washington, which in turn triggered a protest to London.      For the Americans, the last straw was the Treaty of San Remo in April 1920. This represented a carve-up of oil interests in the Middle East between the British and French, resulting in the French joining TPC and effectively excluding the Americans from Iraq. At the urging of US Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, seven US oil companies mounted a challenge to the Europeans, and Socony’s earlier strategy now began to bear fruit. In April 1922, the British dropped their objections to a Socony survey in Palestine as a first move towards accepting a wider American participation in the Middle East.      This was the start of the ‘Open Door’ policy that eventually admitted American oil interests to the Middle East. In July 1928, five US oil firms, including Socony, joined TPC, renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company the following year.

We always said that we have selective price investments in Europe. It's not across the board, but you see it already from Q1 to Q2 that the benefit on the same hedging is less in Q2 compared to Q1. And that will continue in the second half through the selective price set ups that we have. And to tailwind of course from FX such as will fade not just in Europe, but also in China. We've had very favorable hedges in the first half compared to last year. And lastly, definitely we'll get into a tougher comparison not from a net sales point of view, but from a margin point of view in the second half. And I specifically want to mention again to the successful democratization of Yeezy last year in September. If we were not going to repeat in Q3 and that would also be on the margin because it's a highly attractive business for us.

Friday's action represents only the administration's latest slap at Beijing. The president earlier this month pushed a federal retirement pension board to abandon plans to invest in Chinese securities. And the Commerce Department tightened limits on Chinese telecom giant Huawei's ability to purchase American computer chips.
 Just four months after Trump celebrated a partial trade deal with China, marking an apparent truce in a two-year-long diplomatic conflict, relations between the two countries have plummeted. The president has been openly displeased with China's failure to quickly fulfill the trade deal's terms, including massive additional purchases of American crops, energy products and manufactured goods.
 In recent weeks, as the human and financial toll from the coronavirus pandemic soared, the president has lashed out at China in ever sharper tones. He has blamed Chinese officials for suppressing information about the initial outbreak late last year and refusing to cooperate in efforts to investigate its origins.
 "Frankly the U.S. government is - I'll use the word furious with what China has done in recent days, weeks and months, they have not behaved well and they have lost the trust I think of the whole western world," Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said Friday on Fox News.
 On Thursday evening, Pompeo took a swipe at Trump's predecessors in an interview on Fox News.
 "President Trump is the first president - and this isn't political - President Bush, President Obama, they all refused to recognize the threat that the Chinese Communist Party presented to the United States of America," he said. "They were stealing intellectual property from us, they were moving in the South China Sea - all the things that you know. And presidents before just turned their head. They wouldn't do it."

“Looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot,” Trump tweeted. “I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means.”
 White House officials did not respond to a request for comment about whether Trump was aware of the origins of the language on looting and shooting.
 Headley, who spent 20 years leading the Miami department, sought to send an unambiguous message to protesters that he had little tolerance for any actions that he deemed over the line.
 During the 1968 race riots in the Liberty City section of Miami that stemmed from anger in the black community over substandard housing and bleak economic conditions, Headley's language was even more harsh as he reprised the looting- shooting phrase. Police killed three residents during that riot.
 “There is only one way to handle looters and arsonists during a riot and that is to shoot them on sight,” Headley said. “I’ve let the word filter down: When the looting starts, the shooting starts.”
 The Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and frequent critic of Trump's, said that phrase has reverberated in the South and was “always used about civil rights protesters.”

A bluetooth-enabled gun trigger guard called LockOn, the brainchild of five Westlake High School students, won $15,000, allowing the team to develop their business and product.
   
 More than 100 Westlake High School students have formed teams and have been testing their business concepts all year as part of Westlake's Business Incubator program, a business entrepreneur course available to juniors.
   
 Drawing inspiration from reality show Shark Tank, each team would normally present their product ideas to local investors on a live stage. But due to social distancing recommendations to help fight the spread of COVID-19, the disease linked to the coronavirus, this year the top five teams pitched their ideas to local "sharks" in a live Q&A; via Zoom.
   
 The teams, comprised of five students, competed in the virtual pitch May 20 in hopes of being able to launch their business and product. Student winners were surprised at their homes by Incubator staff and mentors, as well as district staff on May 21.
   
 LockOn, which won first place, is a bluetooth-enabled gun trigger guard. The lock eliminates the use of a keyhole and unlocks via touch or face ID through a mobile application. The product aims to prevent accidental shootings, homicides, or suicide attempts that are often the result of an unsecured gun, the team said.
   
 Janus Tag, a QR Code iron-on patch that can be attached to a child's clothing or backpack, won second place, earning a $5,000 grant to further their business efforts. The team said the product could also be used for adults with mental disabilities or alzheimers, who can sometimes get lost.
   
 The patch enables a person to scan the QR code, which then sends a text message with where the person is located.
   
 The three other product ideas included Tride, a trusted rideshare mobile app for students and their families; Recruitr, a recruiting site for lacrosse athletes that allows them to create a profile including stats, film and accomplishments; and Flags Up, a life jacket with an orange, detachable flag that helps keep kids safe while in the water.
   
 The top five products are among dozens of business products created this year.
   
 Jerri LaMirand, director of STEM for Eanes, said students are coached by local experts and teachers to help develop an idea for a business product. The group is assigned a mentor in late September.
   
 She said the goal is to help student teams launch their business and come up with a minimum viable product. Each team pitches their ideas to a panel of judges, made up of community experts, in the classroom, receiving feedback on how to create and test their idea. The product is tested in the spring, and final pitches are made to local "sharks" for a chance to win money and continue their business the next year in the Eanes Accelerator class.
   
 The program, which started about four years ago, has resulted in several innovative business ideas and products that have continued development toward the market, including SipSafe, a date rape detection sticker that helps detect the presence of a date rape drug in a drink, and GameTime Live, a gaming app that allows users to answer trivia questions throughout a live sporting event.
   
 "These students are getting real world experience and hearing expertise from local business owners," LaMirand said. "When the students are on campus we try to make this experience more like a business and not just another class. We try to change the mindset of students and help them realize their potential."
   
 All grants and award money are funded privately by the Westlake Innovation Fund, a group of investors that raise money to support the entrepreneurial education of high school students.
