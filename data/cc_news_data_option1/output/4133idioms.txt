 As more Americans vote early, Trump presses on to Iowa
 With less than three weeks to go until the U.S. presidential election, President Donald Trump on Wednesday will hold a rally in Iowa, as he tries to make up for time lost on the campaign trail during his recent bout with the coronavirus. As Trump races against the clock, Americans are casting ballots early at a record pace. Close to 12 million people have already voted, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.
 U.S. Supreme Court nominee Barrett faces second day of scrutiny
 U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett faces more grilling by senators on Wednesday, a day after fending off repeated efforts by Democrats to elicit clues about her views on the Affordable Care Act, abortion and same-sex marriage. Barrett, who is President Donald Trump's third nominee to the Supreme Court, is set to answer two more rounds of senators' queries on the third day of her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing.
 Supreme Court allows Trump to wind down census early
 The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed President Donald Trump's administration to wind down population counting for the 2020 U.S. census earlier than planned, in a blow to civil rights groups concerned about an undercount, particularly of racial minorities. The justices blocked a lower- court ruling that had ordered the decennial population count be continued until Oct. 31. The Census Bureau said on Aug. 3 that it would wind down data collection by Sept. 30, a month earlier than originally scheduled.
 U.S. coffee drinkers consume as much at home during pandemic, poll shows
 Americans are drinking just as much coffee during the pandemic, as often as before, but at home instead of in coffee shops and restaurants, a poll released on Wednesday showed. Online purchases have jumped by 57% as coffee buyers cut back on trips to the supermarket, according to the survey commissioned by the National Coffee Association (NCA).
 Supreme Court confirmation hearing doubles as campaign stop for embattled Republicans
 Embattled Senate Republicans took advantage of the spotlight at Tuesday's confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump's third Supreme Court nominee to tout election concerns like healthcare, police and even fundraising as they fight to keep their seats. Republican control of the Senate - where the party holds a 53-47 majority - is in jeopardy in the Nov. 3 elections, with 10 incumbent Republicans in races rated competitive, compared with just two Democrats.
 Texas loses bid to reinstate ban on second-trimester abortion procedure
 The state of Texas on Tuesday lost its bid before a U.S. appeals court to reinstate a law that would have effectively banned the most common abortion procedure used by doctors for terminating second-trimester pregnancies. A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans sided with abortion rights activists in affirming a 2017 lower-court decision that struck down the law and temporarily barred its enforcement.
 Eli Lilly pauses trial of antibody drug Trump touted as COVID-19 'cure' over safety concern
 Eli Lilly and Co said on Tuesday that the government-sponsored clinical trial of its COVID-19 antibody treatment similar to one taken by U.S. President Donald Trump has been paused because of a safety concern. Trump touted the Lilly drug, along with the antibody treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc that he received for his COVID-19, as tantamount to a cure in a video he posted last week.
 U.S. accuses author of Melania Trump tell-all book of breaking nondisclosure pact
 The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday accused Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, author of a tell-all book about first lady Melania Trump, of breaking their nondisclosure agreement and asked a court to set aside profits from the book in a government trust. In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, Justice Department lawyers said Winston Wolkoff, a former aide who fell out with the first lady, failed to submit to government for review a draft of her book, "Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady," which offers an unflattering portrayal of President Donald Trump's wife.
 Wildfire threat intensifying across California, officials say
 Hot, dry conditions and intense winds across California are threatening to reinvigorate what has already been the worst fire season in state history, officials warned on Tuesday. Gusty winds in California's north and extreme heat in its south are creating conditions that could fan wildfires that began earlier in the summer as well as spark new ones, leading state and federal authorities to urge residents to prepare.
 Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Biden ahead of Trump in Michigan, tied in North Carolina

Reuters/Ipsos is polling likely voters in six states - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona - that will play critical roles in deciding whether Trump wins a second term in office or if Biden ousts him.

 Over the years, mental illness continues to be a focal point in the film and television industry. As humans, seeing others struggle is a way to make our complicated lives and hardships seem more normal. One particular umbrella of mental illness, eating disorders are often showcased in films such as 'To The Bone and Feed'. However, despite the abundance of films on eating disorders it seems that only one kind of eating disorder and its stereotype are almost always reflected upon: a white young woman or teenager who is visibly anorexic attempts to gain complete control of her life while also possessing a strong desire to lose weight or be thin.
 The protagonist is almost never a person of color, someone labeled as "overweight" or "obese", a part of the LGBTQ+ community or a man. For example, anad.org states that 16% of college students who identified as transgender reported having an eating disorder.
 The majority of eating disorder plots in the film world continue to paint a particular stereotype. To have an eating disorder one must be a Caucasian teenage girl who is unhealthily thin. But nationaleatingdisorders.org shares that according to a study done on how race and social class affect Bulimia Nervosa, "Black teenagers are 50% more likely than white teenagers to exhibit bulimic behavior" and this is not represented in films. This stereotype goes even further assuring that the cause of the eating disorder was to lose weight to fit into the thin standards that society places on women.
 Men, however, are not represented either and although eating disorders are stereotypically "a woman's problem", 10 million men in the U.S. will be affected by an eating disorder at some point in their lives. In addition, some cases are not even identified simply because the person does not come forward. This may be due to embarrassment or denial to accept the situation, inability to realize or even understand that they have a problem and could possibly be a reflection of feeling that they must fit into the painted stereotype. Many are turned away by doctors because although they are using severe behaviors, they are still at a medically healthy weight (or are even classified as overweight) and do not meet the traditional criteria for eating disorders.
 No, medical awareness will not change by creating more films about eating disorders. But, truth be told, these films only further reinforce stereotypes. These stereotypes cause harm and even prevent many from reaching out and/or getting help. To start, we must take away the stereotypes about eating disorders that are ingrained in our heads and understand that even though someone "looks fine" on the outside, they could be struggling on the inside. As research progresses and develops, new diagnoses are made and more people are helped. Finally, like with many things, education, understanding and empathy are the first steps to abolishing stereotypes.

 “I think it was a spark-setter,” Pau’u said during the media teleconference on Tuesday. “We needed one play to spark us. We hadn’t gotten into the groove of things as an offense with different penalties and the turnover by me. We couldn’t get in the flow after the fumble that I had.

The Black Lives Matter movement isn’t named in any of the 120 statewide ballot measures up for a vote on Nov. 3. But this year's nationwide protests over police brutality and racial injustice are major factors in the campaigns in several states for measures with distinctive racial themes.
 In California, voters will decide whether to allow affirmative action in public hiring, contracting and college admissions — 24 years after Californians approved an initiative outlawing programs that give preference based on race and gender.
 Elsewhere, the topics include a replacement for Mississippi’s Confederate- themed state flag, a proposed change in Rhode Island’s official name to remove the word “plantations,” and efforts in Nebraska and Utah to strip language from the state constitutions providing an exemption to the ban on slavery.
 In California, key supporters of the new affirmative-action measure — Proposition 16 — said they weren't sure they could get the needed two-thirds support in both legislative chambers to move forward. That changed, they said, amid the nationwide outcry over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in May.
 “Before his death, it was touch and go,” said Black businessman and civil rights activist Walter Wilson. “Now there’s been a sea change. …Social justice and racial reform are on the ballot.”
 Ward Connerly, a Black businessman and former University of California regent who pushed for the 1996 ban, leads the campaign against Prop 16. He acknowledges that the Black Lives Matter movement has energized his opponents.
 “It may give them impetus but that doesn’t make it right.” Connerly said. “The response should be looking at law enforcement and police tactics — it doesn’t justify discrimination.”
 In Mississippi, where legislators voted in June to retire the last state flag in the U.S. bearing the Confederate battle emblem, voters will decide whether to accept a new flag with a magnolia design. If they vote “No,” another new design will be proposed — and there would be a chance for supporters of the Confederate-themed flag to seek its reinstatement via a ballot measure next year.
 In Rhode Island, whose official name is “Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,” voters will have an opportunity to eliminate the last three words. The measure's proponents say the word “plantations” evokes the grim legacy of slavery, even though that wasn't the connotation when the full name was adopted in 1636.
 Near-identical measures in Nebraska and Utah also deal with wording — they propose eliminating passages in the state constitutions, dating from the 19th century, that allow slavery as punishment for a crime. In neither of those states is there organized opposition to the measures, which advanced through the legislatures on unanimous votes.
 In Mississippi and Rhode Island, Black supporters of the ballot measures hope this year’s nationwide spotlight on racial injustice will bring a different outcome than when similar proposals were on the ballot previously.
 In Mississippi, 64% of voters in a 2001 referendum opted to keep the Confederate-themed flag.
 This time, there was overwhelming support for a new flag among legislators and government leaders. They faced intense pressure from business, religious, education and sports groups amid widespread protests against Confederate symbols.
 Not all Mississippians are on board. Hundreds of people attended a Statehouse rally in August organized by Let Mississippi Vote, the group hoping to have a measure on the 2021 ballot that would offer a chance to reinstate the Confederate-themed flag.
 “In my mind, it is not about a flag at all — this is about the people having a voice,” said state Sen. Chris McDaniel, a leader of the campaign. “Ultimately we will be pleased with whatever the people decide.”
 Some Black residents may vote against the proposed new magnolia flag for a different reason, said Marquise Hunt, a senior at Tougaloo College and former president of the Mississippi NAACP’s Youth & College Division.
 As mandated by the Legislature, the proposed new flag bears the words “In God We Trust."
 “There are a lot of Black people asking, ‘Is that a God of continued white supremacy?'” said Hunt, 22. “I think we can do better than this.”
 In Rhode Island, which was a major player in the global slave trade during colonial times, a proposal to delete “Providence Plantations” from the state’s name was soundly defeated in 2010.
 Supporters of the change believe they have a better chance of prevailing this time, in part because of the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement and other campaigns for racial justice.
 “I think this time people will say ‘Yes,’” said Ray Rickman, a Black civic leader and former deputy secretary of state. ”It will be about white folks feeling good about themselves.”
 “I wish it were something bigger and better — like getting the first Black justice on the state Supreme Court,” he said. “But this would be a start. It’s an easy, symbolic gesture.”
 In Nebraska, state Sen. Justin Wayne proposed the amendment to strip the slavery provision from the state constitution back in January 2019 — 16 months before George Floyd’s death. But Wayne said this year’s dramatic race-related events made it all the more important that Nebraska address racist aspects of its past.
 He noted that Nebraska’s efforts to join the union in 1866 were complicated by its unsuccessful efforts to limit voting rights to white men only.
 “With all that we’ve seen going on with race this year, it’s critical that we remove the legacy and the tentacles of slavery from our founding documents,” Wayne said.
 The provision allowing slavery as punishment for a crime hasn’t been used in many decades; it was used long ago to force former slaves back into unpaid labor for private parties.
 In Utah, the slavery measure’s lead sponsor was Rep. Sandra Hollins, the only Black person now serving in the Legislature. There was little debate on the measure itself, but Hollins hopes national developments will prompt her colleagues to address issues of racism and police reform.
 “It’s a conversation you can no longer avoid," she said.

Sharon admitted that she’ll always have feelings for Adam — she’d even always love him. So what did she do in the wake of that confession? Run right home and pop the question to Rey, the far more sensible mate for her. Is she kidding herself, trying to believe that she can be happy with Rey when she really wants to be with Adam? Of course she is. And therein lies the juicy drama. (It’s also classic Sharon, trying to listen to her head when at the end of the day, her heart is always going to be louder.)                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

United Community Banks Inc. (UCBI) shares on Tuesday's trading session, dropped -2.14 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $18.76 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of $1.93 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $1.77 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is 11.70% and predicted to reach at 12.00% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out-come was 15.80% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 1.00% for the next five year.

We all know about the billions in funding to fight Covid-19, respond to the threat of Brexit and support measures like the Christmas Bonus for welfare recipients. But there was a lot more to Budget 2021. Here’s a flavour of what was in the fine print. 1 Hunt for more Spanish language teachersSpanish is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world and the Government clearly wants more young people to learn it. The Department of Education will use some of its funding to improve secondary school teacher supply for Spanish as well as maths and physics.2 Battle against cyber security threatsThe National Cyber Security Centre is tasked with managing security incidents and threats related to the State's IT systems. It will be allocated cash as it seeks to implement its strategy up to 2024 to protect &ldquo;critical national infrastructure&rdquo; and build &ldquo;resilience of public sector data and networks&rdquo;.3 €11m for museums, art galleries and orchestraFunding for Minister Catherine Martin's culture department will allow it to &ldquo;enhance support&rdquo; to the National Cultural Institutions like museums and art galleries to the tune of €11m. This includes funding for the process of transferring the National Symphony Orchestra from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall. The Arts Council funding is to be boosted by €50m to €130m.4 Re-train to retrofitThere are big plans to retrofit homes for energy efficiency as part of the battle against climate change. Higher Education Minister Simon Harris will use part of €27.5m in funding for up-skilling and re-skilling to provide 1,500 places on retro-fitting courses.5 €290,000 on staff at Department of FinanceThe Department of Finance is to spend €290,000 on two units in the Department of Finance – EuroGroup and Climate Action. The number of staff is not listed but some of the spending is evidently related to Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe&rsquo;s election as president of the EU&rsquo;s powerful EuroGroup.6 Overseas aid to rise by €30mIreland is borrowing tens of billions to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic but the world&rsquo;s poorest countries are also fighting the pandemic. Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) is rising by €30m to €867m in 2021 with some of the funds to go on the hoped-for vaccine response to Covid-19.7 Plans to spend €650m on PPEA massive €650m has been set aside for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like masks, gloves and gowns in 2021 as the pandemic continues. It&rsquo;s hoped that manufacturing in Ireland will have &ldquo;wider economic benefits for the country&rdquo;.8 €13m to be spent on the weatherMet Éireann is to get €13m in capital funding. It&rsquo;s to be spent on &ldquo;key projects&rdquo; like a national flood forecasting and warning service and new weather radar as well as its core meteorological infrastructure.9 Better conditions for Limerick prisonersThe Department of Justice is to spend €15m on an &ldquo;extensive modernisation&rdquo; of the prison facilities for male and female prisoners at Limerick Prison.10 Boost to island pensionersPensioners and certain other welfare recipients who live on the islands get extra cash in their weekly payments to compensate for the additional costs of living. This is being increased from €12.70 to €20 per week.11 €50m for cross-border projects to be spent in 2021Plans for €500m in spending for Taoiseach Micheál Martin&rsquo;s Shared Island initiative were outlined in the Budget. Of this, €50m is to be spent next year. Staffing for the Shared Island Unit will come from €1.75m to be spent on a number of new measures in the Department of the Taoiseach. It will also spend €15m on Covid-19 public communications.12 Funds to develop products to help fight Covid-19There's an extra €30m for the Covid Life Sciences Products scheme which is aimed at supporting the research, development and production of medicinal products in Ireland that are used in the fight against the virus. The funding for Tánaiste Leo Varadkar's Department goes to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.13 &lsquo;Secret Service&rsquo; gets €2mThe budget for the mysterious &lsquo;Secret Service&rsquo; will stay at €2m this year. The funding doesn&rsquo;t go to a single agency but has previously been reported to be used by the gardaí and military intelligence to fund sensitive operations.14 Funding for Centenarian&rsquo;s Bounty stays the sameEstimated spending on Centenarian&rsquo;s Bounty – the €2,540 payment people get when they turn 100 along with a letter from the President – is usually increased every year. The full fund has not been used for at least the last two years. The funding for next , €1.544m, stays the same as the 2020 estimate. This would provide for payments to around 600 people turning 100 next year.15 Plans to track sheepSome of the Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s funding will go towards using electronic identification of &ldquo;five million sheep movements from approximately 40,000 farms&rdquo; per year. It&rsquo;s not about counting sheep, but rather to support food traceability efforts.

Working hard to even the score, Meadville’s midfielders gummed up the midfield, finding their forwards to take shots on Clarion’s goalie Logan Bish, who had seven saves in the first half. Defender Emilie Best switched the field, finding fellow defender Noah Baumcratz on the right side. Baumcratz carried the ball up the sideline and found right wing Isaac Lerch who sped down the sideline with two defenders in pursuit and quickly got off a side shot on goal with another rebound opportunity. Unfortunately for Clarion, the opportunity faded as the goalie eventually pounced on the ball.

Trump on September 24 laid out what he called his "vision" for health care in America, but the two executive orders Trump said he was going to sign fall far short of a comprehensive proposal. Trump said he was signing an executive order to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, even as Trump and Republican lawmakers attempt to try to tear down the Affordable Care Act that already protects them. The second executive order directs Congress to pass legislation to address surprise medical billing by the end of the year, and if lawmakers don't achieve this, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will seek to do so via executive or regulatory action. Trump campaigned against the Affordable Care Act on the runup to his presidency. While the Republican-controlled Congress failed to repeal the law, Trump has taken a number of executive actions to undermine it, including making it easier for Americans to access alternative policies that have fewer protections and benefits. The administration is also seeking to invalidate the landmark health care law through the courts. Trump has promised to reduce drug prices and unveiled a blueprint to do so in 2018. Bucking long-standing Republican beliefs, the President is pushing to allow drug importation, particularly from Canada, and to tie the price of drugs in the US to their cost in other developed nations. However, several of his efforts have been stymied, including requiring drug makers to include their list prices in TV ads, which was nixed by a federal judge in summer 2019. In an effort to lower health care costs overall, the administration also issued a rule requiring hospitals to post the rates they negotiate privately with health insurers, starting in 2021. A coalition of major hospital groups took legal action to block the requirement.

During his 2016 campaign, Trump proposed the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border, and has made it a tenet of his immigration policy as President. After taking office, he issued an executive order suspending the entry of people from a number of Muslim-majority countries for 90 days; the order went through several iterations in court before it was upheld. The administration's "zero tolerance" policy in 2018 -- criminal prosecutions of adults who illegally crossed the border -- resulted in thousands of family separations at the border as parents were detained. Under a court order, the government must identify and reunify certain separated children. The President has proposed a merit-based immigration system, establishing a points-based system for green card holders and restricting sponsorship to spouses and minor children. Trump also officially ended Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children, a decision that has now been taken to the Supreme Court.

Then he’ll rely on the House of Representatives to put him over the top.
 “We are going to be counting ballots for the next two years,” Trump warned at a recent Pennsylvania rally, noting “we have an advantage if we go back to Congress. I think it’s 26 to 22 or something. It’s counted one vote per state. So we actually have an advantage.”
 He was referring to the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that if state electors deadlock or can’t agree on a president, the decision goes to the House. There, each of the nation’s 50 states gets one vote.
 That means small Republican-dominated states such as Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming (each with one House member, who’s a Republican) would have the same clout as large Democratic states like California (with 52 House members, 44 of whom are Democrats).
 Trump does have the advantage right now: 26 state congressional delegations in the House are now controlled by Republicans, and 22 by Democrats. Two — Pennsylvania and Michigan — are essentially tied.
 But he won’t necessarily retain that advantage. The decision would be made by lawmakers elected in November, who will be sworn in on Jan. 3 — three days before they’ll convene to decide the winner of the election.
 Which is why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is focusing on races that could tip the balance of state delegations — not just in Pennsylvania and Michigan but any others within reach.
 “It’s sad we have to plan this way,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues last month, “but it’s what we must do to ensure the election is not stolen.”
 Trump’s 5th Avenue principle has kept him in power despite levels of deprivation, desperation and death that would have doomed the presidencies of anyone else. But as a former New Yorker, he should know that 5th Avenue ends at the Harlem River at 142nd Street, and the end is near.

The court heard that officers found more than 400 indecent videos on his phone including 173 of Category A, the most explicit kind. One of these Category A videos showed a boy aged around four being raped by a man.
 Officers also found Lewis had been talking about videos showing the sexual abuse of children and babies with other paedophiles via the Kik messaging service, and had seven live links to the Mega online encrypted storage facility.
 Lewis, of Graig Avenue, Abercwmboi, Aberdare, had previously pleaded guilty to battery and to assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), and to six counts of making - downloading - and distributing indecent images when he appeared in the dock for sentencing. The prosecutor said it was accepted the use of the car in the ABH involving the brother was on a reckless basis rather that a deliberate use of the vehicle as a weapon.
 The court heard Lewis has two previous convictions for five offences, including one from 2018 which resulted in a woman suffering fractured ribs.
 Lee Davies, for Lewis, said the defendant's life had "spiralled out of control" after he lost his job as a railway engineer, and he began taking large quantities of cocaine.
 He said his client was "incredibly sorry" that the Glynneath incident happened, and accepted it had been his fault.
 The advocate said Lewis also accepted the images offences were "abhorrent", and that the defendant "is appalled at himself in becoming involved" in their distribution.
 Mr Davies added that his client's family remained supportive of him.
