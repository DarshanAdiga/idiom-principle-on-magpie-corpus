He did initially agree to join the rebel tour to South Africa in 1989 but in light of the anti-apartheid protests, decided not to.

TAUNTON -- City government is in the process of moving into the newly renovated, rebuilt and expanded City Hall on Summer Street. Mayor Shaunna O'Connell said they are excited to be doing so, as it not only gives them more space and a modern set up to work with, but because it will allow them to better serve their constituents.
 "It's much more functional than where we are now at the old school. We're really excited to be moving to our beautiful, restored City Hall." O'Connell said during a tour last week. " ...There are such beautiful views here in our building that give you a deep sense of appreciation for our community, our history and for all our citizens in the city of Taunton."
 According to the Mayor's Office, though most City offices are not where they used to be, the renovated building's layout is more conducive to public use for many reasons. Firstly, if entering from the rear parking lot, the most frequented City offices are easily accessible. The City Clerk and Tax Collector's offices are on the first floor as you enter the building, and the Veteran's and Registrar of Voters offices are on the street level if entering from Summer Street.
 We can deliver news just like this directly to your inbox. You can sign up for This Just In (a daily newsletter that comes out at 7:30 p.m. each evening with items we've posted that day), News Alerts (so you don't miss anything important), our Daily Newsletter (sent each morning) and more. It's customized to your preferences -- and it'll only take a few seconds.
 Secondly, the City Council chamber is now handicap accessible.
 The first floor of the building, at the rear parking level, also holds the Treasurer's and IT department offices. The second floor, level with Summer Street, also houses the Assessor's and Clerk of Committee's Offices. On the third floor is the Office of Economic and Community Development and the Auditor's Office, and the fourth floor houses the Mayor's, Law and Budget Director's offices.
 City officials are moving back into the building for the first time in a decade. Originally built in 1848, it was damaged in an arson fire in 2010 which forced City Government out and into a temporary city hall on Oak Street fashioned out of an old elementary school.
 After years of deliberation, construction began on the building in February 2019, and is just now concluding. The project cost $27 million.
 "A lot of work has gone into this over the last few years by people too numerous to mention, but we appreciate all our efforts," O'Connell said.
 The project preserved many of the building's history features, such as antique fireplaces and vaults. O'Connell said this is one of her favorite things about the renovated building, as it respects the city's long history.
 O'Connell also said the space and facilities at the new building stand in stark contrast to that available to them at the temporary City Hall. During the tour, she described many offices at the Oak Street building as being "like a closet."
 "It's a big difference here, and it really will give our employees the ability to serve the public so much better," she said.
 All City Offices will be operational in the building by Oct. 15. Tours of the building will begin Saturday, Oct. 17. Registration is required before the tour and is available on the City's website through the mayor's tab.

In a time when many McLeod County residents are feeling cooped up due to COVID-19, the local 4-H has found ways to connect its members and provide opportunities during the pandemic.


  Darcy Cole, McLeod County 4-H program coordinator, and local 4-H federal officers McKenna Wright, Emma Becker and Julia Quast reviewed those achievements in the annual report to the McLeod County Board Oct. 6, shortly after that week had been declared National 4-H Week in McLeod County.


  "It was a time where we had to think really differently about how things look and feel," Cole said. "A lot of things were offered virtually. But we did have some opportunities to be in person."


  4-H usually offers its soap making class in person, but this year it went digital, much like other opportunities typically associated with the local or state fairgrounds. In the local showcase, 120 youth showcased 677 projects. Animal science showcases were made possible with in-person animal shows followed by virtual interviews that would normally be carried out face to face.


  State projects went digital, with six youth exhibiting nine livestock projects. Another 14 youth exhibited 22 static projects to bring home 17 blue ribbons and two purple ribbons. Eight local 4-H'ers were in the top 10 animal science rankings, with one named reserve champion. 4-H'ers brought home an award of excellence, two finalist awards and a reserve champion reward in showmanship. Three locals participated in the dairy showcase, with McKenzie Swanson in ninth place, Kiley Lickfelt at 14th place and Emma Friauf at 16th place.


  "It's hard enough in a regular year," said McLeod County Vice Chair Doug Krueger. "You guys did an excellent job."


  A few activities were able to be held in person, such as horse arena riding practice after July 1.


  "It helped reduce the feelings of isolation that people had," Cole said.


  Shooting sports practices, which tend to grow quiet during the summer after a winter spike, remained popular throughout recent months.


  "People were looking for something positive to do in person, and to be able to interact with each other," Cole said.


  "Our ability to put together an in-person show for these kids, and our shooting sports program as well, was something very few kids nationwide were able to participate in," said Board Member Paul Wright, who credited 4-H staff and volunteers for implementing safe practices. "These kids will move forward and be an absolute asset to their community. They're worth all of the investment that we can put forward."

The topic of eugenics is vast and something the world needs to acknowledge as an ongoing problem. We need scientists from all backgrounds unwinding these theories and bringing their own research not only to the field of genetics, but across the board. It is important that science is unbiased and founded in experiments and research, otherwise it creates further problems within society. For example, according to The Washington Post many Americans think there are such things as ‘Black blood’ and ‘Black disease’. If we cannot eradicate racial bias such as this from genetics, then this ingrained mentality will continue. We must not tolerate any form of bias in science, but when the science itself becomes prejudiced is when we face these ignorant views, which will not be changed without diversity within the field.

Everybody thought she was crazy. I mean, she's _Linda Ronstadt_. A reigning queen of rock and roll.

And then go on tour with a full Mexican orchestra, fronting the ensemble dressed in traditional peasant dresses and smart mariachi jackets with a big red flower in her hair?
 Well, despite not working on paper, 1987's _Canciones de Mi Padre_ was not only a smash, but Ronstadt did more Spanish-language records. It all stemmed from a simple desire she had to reconnect with her family's roots and culture (her father was Mexican) and celebrate the songs she remembered from family singalongs. And it struck a chord with audiences who had never heard of "You're No Good," "It's So Easy" or "Blue Bayou."

PEMBROKE -- Incumbent Josh Cutler will face off against Republican candidate Tatyana Semyrog for state representative of the 6th Plymouth District in the Nov. 3 general election.
 The 6th Plymouth District includes the towns of Pembroke, Duxbury and Hanson.
 Cutler, a 49-year-old Democrat, has held the seat for four terms. He co- sponsored the Energy Savings and Efficiency Act (Energy SAVE), and led the successful effort to restore weekend commuter rail service to the South Shore.
 "I'm running for re-election (because) I want to continue to use my experience to help solve problems and make sure that our district continues to be a great place to live, work, and raise a family," Cutler said.
 Looking toward a potential fifth term, Cutler said he is focused on renewable energy, climate change, economic development and education. He said he wants to focus on bringing local aid to his district, and previously helped pass the Student Opportunity Act, which will provide funding to school districts to address disparities in achievement.
 Cutler also said he is focused on supporting small businesses, especially in light of COVID-19.
 "We need to focus on our economic recovery and helping all businesses, but especially our small businesses that need help the most," Cutler said.
 Semyrog did not respond to email, phone or social media attempts to contact her for this story, but did participate Monday in a candidate forum hosted by radio station WATD.
 In the forum, Semyrog touched on oppression she experienced in her birth country, the former Soviet Union, and said she now sees similar behavior in the United States with the "labeling, bullying, debasing, marginalizing, and ostracizing" of people who do not agree with "the left."
 Cutler said the role of a state representative is three-fold, but most importantly it requires one to provide constituent service. He said that is especially important because of the pandemic as people navigate unemployment and financial assistance for their small businesses. The other two roles, he said, are fighting for the district's share of state resources and being a leader on issues of importance to the district as well as the state.
 "I think I have a track record I think of getting things done, of being a voice for my district, I mean I can give you a litany of examples," Cutler said. "I'm comfortable [with] people judging me on my record and I hope that they will and I think if they look at that they'll see that I've done a fair job and I work hard and I've been an effective voice for our district."
 Semyrog said that her name has been "dragged through the mud and smeared," and that she has not received an apology from Cutler for what Semyrog says are attacks on her heritage, past, and character.
 "I am running to stand up against this oppression, to give people hope and courage," Semyrog said during the WATD candidates forum. "Our freedoms are under attack by the kind of socialist agenda my opponent has been voting for. His votes to defund our police, increase our gas tax, all while voting twice to increase his pay speak of a radical leftist who has no businesses representing this district."
 In response, Cutler said that he supports policing reform, such as the licensing and certification of police officers, but does not support "defunding the police," which refers to the reallocation of funds from police departments to other priority areas. Additionally, he said that the gas tax has decreased by 40% since he took office, although he did vote in support of the March tax bill.
 Semyrog was recently criticized on social media over comments she appears to have made under her maiden name on the blog shoebat.com. The comments, which are now deleted, addressed the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.
 She responded to the attacks with a post on her personal blog, where she said she is not able to recall much of the time period during which those comments were made due to her cancer diagnosis and death of her husband.
 "I don't recognize any of those words as ever have been written by me because I simply have no memory of such," Semyrog wrote in the blog post.
 Cutler currently resides in Pembroke with his wife and two children.
 Semyrog is a resident of Duxbury where she lives with her three children.

Anthony Mackie recently called out Marvel, in light of the Black Lives Matter movement, and was asked to comment on Marvel’s seemingly white-washing of comic book heroes. His response noted that Marvel, like many companies, suffers from an ‘unawareness problem rather than a racist problem.’ This shows that like many companies in the world right now Marvel is facing a reckoning with systemic racism within the film industry and that by not facing up to it before and following the status quo- it has wrought itself a huge cross to bear. Mackie, in a further interview, condemned Marvel for not only it’s lack of representation on screen but also behind. He decried Marvel’s hypocrisy for hiring ‘Black people for the Black movie’ whereas on the other seven Marvel films Mackie has worked on the crew has predominantly white. The fact that 90.7% of all Marvel’s directors have been white, shows there is a lack of diverse voices telling stories, limiting the scope of diversity that can ultimately be seen on-screen.

I have never been convicted of a crime.
 Jason Elmore, 28th Circuit Court Judge candidate
 • Tell us about yourself.
 This has been my family’s home for five generations. I grew up playing on its streets, working its fields, and going to its schools. Alicia, our three children and I choose to live here. I graduated from Hope College, Chicago- Kent College of Law, and U.S. Command and General Staff College. For 22 years, I have been an attorney and am an Army lieutenant colonel with active, deployed, and reserve duty. I have served as a local, federal, and military prosecuting, defense, and appellate counsel, as well as a military judge. I have severed with several local programs, organizations, and boards.
 • Why are you running for this position?
 We are all mere stewards of our time, talents, and treasures. I am called to serve. I have been blessed to call this home, to receive a good education, and to serve my country and community in valuable ways. My experiences and lessons of leadership and service accumulated in the Army, community programs, and courtrooms here and around the world have uniquely prepared me to serve in this position of public trust. I have watched and learned from Judges Peterson, Corwin, and Fagerman over decades, who have set a great example and high bar of compassion, fairness, and justice.
 • In your opinion, what do you believe are the core responsibilities of the office you are seeking?
 Judges are an indispensable part of justice. As a defense attorney, I represented the accused. As a local, federal and army prosecutor, I fought to protect society. As an Army judge, I ensured the conduct in the courtroom was professional and dignified. Judges ensure the judicial system is operated for the benefit of the parties and the public; not itself. Judges safeguard the rights of the parties and rule impartially on matters brought before the court in strict accordance with the law. When discretion is properly exercised, a judge applies it fairly, not based on political agendas and personal whims.
 • How can courts address the issue of drugs in our communities?
 As the prosecutor, I worked in and out of the courtroom for solutions to our drug epidemic. Drug crimes impact both the user and society. I have worked closely with police and media, supported improved treatment programing, and yet achieved increased prison sentences for repeat offenders. The roles of the judge and prosecutor are distinct. The prosecutor alone decides how and when to prosecute cases. Judges speak through their sentences, which must balance punishment and rehabilitation with deterrence and protection of society. Judges, however, can and should work behind the scenes to improve the administration of justice and rehabilitative options
 • What are your thoughts on sentencing guidelines?
 The sentencing guidelines only apply to felony cases. They are intended to reduce disparity between cases and to guide judges to fair and just sentences. They take into consideration prior convictions and the severity of the offense. I have 15 years of experience working with attorneys, judges, and the Department of Correction on hundreds of cases involving sentencing guidelines. Consistent, knowledgeable, and fair application of the guidelines in issuing sentences aid prosecutors and defense counsel in how to prosecute, defend, and resolve cases. Experience leads to fair and just sentencing on the cases that matter the most to our communities.
 • How would you approach mask enforcement complaints due to the current COVID-19 pandemic?
 Many people may think judges enforce the laws. Prosecutors and police enforce laws. Judges rule on legal disputes. During these trying COVID times, I choose to believe that citizens, businesses, groups, and leaders are trying to do the right thing. As a community, we have gone through fear, frenzy, hope, and confusion. We have seen 181 emergency executive orders and rescissions come and go. The best we can do is work together and adapt. In direct response, however, it is worth noting that most violations of the Governor’s orders would be misdemeanors handled in the lower district, not circuit, court.
 • Have you ever been convicted of either a felony or a misdemeanor? If so, when was it and for what were you convicted?
 No.

FALL RIVER - Town nurse Emily Lachance has been administering the flu shot at several drive-thru flu clinics in Swansea and Somerset over the past month. While in Fall River, Tess Curran, director of Health and Human Services is advising residents to see their primary care physicians or visit a flu shot clinic at a local pharmacy or store.
 No matter where, the message this season is clear: Get a flu shot.
 In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the flu shot is more important than ever, said Curran. While she always encourages everyone over age 6 months to get the flu shot, this year it's of even more significance because COVID can mirror some of the symptoms of the flu, she said.
 "People sometimes belittle the flu, but the flu kills people every year, so it's really important every year to get the flu shot but this year it's critical," added Curran.
 Fall River hasn't held flu shot clinics in years because there's so many other ways to access flu shots in the community and most types of insurance cover the cost them, said Curran.
 The flu season runs from October to May, but Curran is encouraging everyone to get the shot as soon as possible. The precautions people are urged to use to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as washing hands, wearing masking and avoiding any unnecessary contact outside the home, will also help with limiting the spread of the flu, added Curran.
 In Somerset and Swansea, Lachance will administer 1,300 flu shots over this season. She has already administered 650 flu shots in three clinics and she has another 650 shots available to administer at upcoming flu shot clinics and in her office by appointment. Lachance ordered the shots last spring through her supplier, but she was told they were out of shots now so once the remaining 650 are used up that will be the end of her supply for this season. The next ones will be Oct. 17 and 24. Check the Swansea website to make an appointment.
 She said the huge demand for the flu shot has resulted in delays in shipping, at least from one of the bigger companies. "I did have a few weeks where I had nothing," said Lachance. "I would not be surprised if I run out entirely this year."
 LaChance said she also does in-house clinics in the schools in both towns' schools with the assistance of the Swansea school nurses.
 Somerset Fire Chief Jamison Barros said the Somerset Fire Department has been able to help Lachance with administering the flu shots at the drive-thru flu clinics as a result of the Community EMS Program. Through that program, 33 members of the fire department have been trained to administer vaccines, which will also apply to a vaccine for COVID-19, when its available, he said.
 "Somerset Fire has been and will be a huge help," said Lachance.

We would have been beside ourselves…to put her in a cage with a bunch of other children who are crying for their mothers? But you're in the [border agents'] power. They can do anything they want."
 Keach also inserts interviews with a couple of the performers and their families at their homes, who tell their own harrowing stories about encounters with immigration authorities and others over their Mexican heritage and identity.
 One of the film's funniest lines comes when Ronstadt is trying to explain Los Cenzontles' take on traditional Mexican tunes and decrees "it's not Dorito music." On the phone, she explains. "It's like ordering a taco salad and saying you're going to celebrate a Mexican holiday. It's what people [wrongly] think you culture is," she says.

HINGHAM -- Private youth sports teams are helping to drive recent increases in coronavirus cases in the town, a Hingham official said on Tuesday.
 "We're all very concerned about these developments," said Town Administrator Tom Mayo.
 During a board of selectmen meeting on Tuesday, Mayo said private teams are seeing a "troubling increase" in coronavirus cases. This especially applies to teams that play indoor sports, particularly ice hockey, basketball and indoor soccer.
 In some instances, the Hingham Health Department has told entire teams to self-quarantine after potential exposure in the virus.
 While the teams seeing cases are not Hingham Public School teams, Mayo said, the cases are impacting people with ties to the school system.
 A cluster epidemiologist from the state government is examining some of the outbreaks, he said.
 Mayo urged residents to stay home and not attend school and work if they have been around someone who's tested positive for the virus, and to cooperate with contact tracers from the town and state.
 "Ignoring an order to quarantine… puts everyone at risk," he said.
 The town is also seeing an increase in transmission of the virus among members of the same household. Mayo encouraged residents who are quarantining to keep away from others in their house, to not share food and to use separate bedrooms and bathrooms if possible.
 For the past month, Hingham has been in the "yellow," or moderate, risk zone for coronavirus transmission according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The town has seen an uptick in virus cases in recent weeks following months with relatively low case numbers compared to neighboring towns.
 Mayo said the town is "on the cusp" of moving into the "red," or high-risk zone for transmission rates.
 "We certainly hope it doesn't happen. The only way to avoid it is for everyone in this community to start taking this seriously and follow the guidance," he said.
 In response to concerns about scam callers pretending to be contact tracers, Interim Police Chief David Jones said a genuine contact tracing caller will never ask for a person's date of birth or social security number. He advised residents to never give out sensitive personal information over the phone.
 If a resident has concerns about a call, "you can always get a number and call somebody back," he said.

There isn't one correct strategy for growing our business as each terrain and each hurdle varies by context. A game-plan in-advance is good, but it simply is a template. The number of unanticipated problems simply can't all be mapped out in advance. As the complexity of our world expands into uncharted territory, it's increasingly important to develop a strong mental attitude to face the challenges that come to our business as we grow. Such a mindset involves honing a clear, open, broad perspective that seeks out new possibilities without prejudice.

L'amministrazione comunale realizzerà una campagna per promuovere le consegne a domicilio di ristoranti e pizzerie del territorio. Questa una delle prime misure a sostegno della ristorazione annunciata ieri (giovedì) nel corso di un incontro con il tavolo dei ristoratori convocato dal Comune, previo passaggio con le associazioni di categoria, dopo le nuove regole introdotte dal nuovo Dpcm sull'emergenza Covid. Il nuovo decreto ministeriale stabilisce che le attività dei servizi di ristorazione (fra cui bar, pub, ristoranti, gelaterie, pasticcerie) sono consentite fino alla ore 24 con consumazione al tavolo, mentre senza consumo al tavolo sono consentite fino alle 21. Nel corso dell'incontro, al quale hanno partecipato il sindaco Luca Menesini e l'assessore al commercio Serena Frediani, l'amministrazione comunale ha dato la massima disponibilità a farsi interprete delle richieste di chiarimento sul nuovo Dpcm, presso Governo e Regione ed ha confermato l'apertura fino a fine anno del 'Bando rilancio' a sostegno di piccole attività, micro imprese e centri commerciali naturali del territorio colpiti dalle conseguenze dell'emergenza sanitaria, che mette a disposizione un fondo di 200 mila euro. Da parte loro i ristoratori si sono dichiarati pronti a rispettare appieno le nuove disposizioni e tutti i protocolli di sicurezza per garantire la tranquillità dei propri clienti.
 "Abbiamo espresso ai ristoratori la massima disponibilità del nostro ente ad accompagnarli e sostenerli in questo nuovo percorso che si apre dopo il nuovo Dpcm, così come abbiamo fatto anche nelle fasi precedenti dell'emergenza – spiega l'assessore al commercio, Serena Frediani-. Una prima concreta iniziativa sarà la realizzazione di una campagna di promozione delle consegne a domicilio di pranzi e pizze ed altri prodotti, ma siamo pronti a realizzarne altre sulla base delle esigenze che emergeranno. In questa nuova fase riteniamo importanti le risorse che abbiamo messo a disposizione delle piccole attività, micro imprese e centri commerciali con il 'Bando rilancio', perché permetteranno, oltre all'acquisto dei necessari dispositivi di sicurezza, anche di poter realizzare attività di comunicazione, marketing e promozione per rilanciare il livello di domanda del mercato, aspetto molto importante in questo delicato momento".
 Il bando rilancio prevede due misure. Con la prima misura, finanziata con 175 mila euro, si prevedono contributi per piccole attività, micro imprese, circoli privati autorizzati alla somministrazione di alimenti e bevande e soggetti associativi che esercitano attività commerciale, oltre che per le spese sostenute per adeguarsi alle misure sulla sicurezza anti Covid 19 (mascherine, dispositivi per protezione oculare, disinfettanti, sanificazioni) e per investimenti sull'innovazione, anche per le spese sostenute per attività di comunicazione, marketing e promozione per rilanciare il livello di domanda del mercato. Il nuovo bando è rivolto a tutte le attività che dal 1 marzo al 31 maggio hanno subito un calo di fatturato uguale o superiore al 20% rispetto allo stesso periodo dell'esercizio precedente. Per le attività di recente avvio il requisito di accesso al contributo è che la perdita media mensile sostenuta nel periodo 1 marzo – 31 maggio sia maggiore del 20% rispetto al fatturato medio mensile ottenuto dall'inizio dell'attività.
 I contributi sono previsti fino al 70%, per un massimo di 500 euro, delle spese sostenute. Le spese devono essere sostenute nel periodo successivo alla pubblicazione del bando e risultare pagate alla data di invio della domanda di rimborso.
 La seconda misura di sostegno prevede un plafond di 25 mila euro destinato ai Centri Commerciali Naturali del territorio, Capannori, Marlia, Segromigno in Monte, Segromigno in Piano, Guamo e Coselli e alle aggregazioni di attività per la realizzazione di eventi di animazione delle frazioni e promozione e valorizzazione del territorio e dei suoi prodotti. In questo caso i contributi, sempre fino al 70% delle spese sostenute, possono raggiungere un massimo di 5.000 euro. Le spese per le quali si chiede il contributo possono già essere state sostenute o possono essere previste per attività da realizzarsi entro il 31 dicembre 2020.
 Il bando e le informazioni per parteciparvi sono pubblicate sulla home page del sito del Comune nella sezione 'Fondo Rilancio'.

Although the KitchenAid K150 gets rave reviews for its sleek, modern look and its ice crushing pre-set, we didn’t find it up to snuff.

Blending soups took even longer, and even though we knew it was only going to make us feel worse, we just kept watching this one video on repeat of our friends riding around with their arms in their air like they were on a rollercoaster, but then the guy filming suddenly crashes and the phone goes flying and you can hear everyone laughing about it and having a great time.

Some voters have been wary of using the post office after national reports of slowed election mail service, and that was a key reason for Regina Wilson, 60, of South Bend, who was voting Thursday downtown.
 “I did mail for the primary but I wanted to make sure my vote gets here, and I was worried about that,” Wilson said.
 Some ballots seem to have gone missing in an apparent mix-up with the post office. The ballots were to have been processed by the post office in September, Glenn said at a county election board meeting Thursday, but at least 100 voters have called to say they haven’t yet received their ballots, so the clerk’s office is resending them. She said she’s still trying to figure out what happened.
 “It is possible then that we could get double ballots,” said Republican election board member Murray Winn.
 Election officials said while it’s possible for the county to get double ballots, the first ballot returned is the one that’s processed, and the computer system will not allow a second ballot to be processed for the same voter.
 “Our system will not allow you to vote twice,” Catherine Fanello, Democratic chairwoman of the election board, said. “There are checks and balances.”
 St. Joseph County currently has about 170,000 active voters, up from 164,000 last spring.
 The county’s voter registration office has been processing nearly 4,000 voter registrations it received by an Oct. 5 deadline from people who want to vote in the fall election.
 About 144,000 Hoosiers cast ballots during the first week of early voting, the secretary of state’s office said Tuesday. National media reported Wednesday that an estimated 14 million Americans had cast early ballots.
 In St. Joseph County, early ballots can be cast in person at the County-City Building downtown and at the County Services Building in Mishawaka up to Election Day.
 On Election Day itself, the election board plans to have 42 vote centers, dozens fewer than would typically operate because of the pandemic. If you visit the county's website at sjcindiana.com and click on the 2020 General Election banner on the home page, a map will show you the vote center closest to your home. Voters can cast a ballot at any vote center.
 Election officials are hoping a robust early voter turnout will take pressure off the limited number of vote centers Nov. 3.
 “I’m not taking any chances,” said Kate Tapper, 41, of Mishawaka, about why she turned out Thursday to vote early and didn’t want to wait. “This election is so important in terms of reproductive freedom, climate change … this election means everything to me.”

FOXBORO -- This 2020 NFL season has been strange but that's how this year has been for everyone. For the Patriots, returning to the practice field Thursday brought some semblance of normalcy.
 On this day, the Patriots not only had a full practice for the first time since Oct. 2 but also had Cam Newton and Stephon Gilmore return. After both players tested negative for coronavirus, the two Pro Bowlers were taken off the NFL's COVID-19/Reserve list. With their starting quarterback and Pro Bowl cornerback back in the fold, the Patriots will prepare for their already rescheduled match with the Denver Broncos with their two best players back on the field.
 After losing to Kansas City without Newton, the starting quarterback's return had his teammates fired up Thursday. Add to that the addition of Gilmore and it made for a good day for the Patriots.
 "It felt good. It felt good to have everyone back out there as a team just to practice," said cornerback Jonathan Jones. "You miss having those guys out there. They're a big part of what we do. Just having them out there today definitely felt different."
 "It was great to have all those guys back," receiver N'Keal Harry said. "They're a big part of the team and they help a lot of us out there. It was great to have them back."
 Everyone knew this season would be different and it was certainly expected that players around the NFL would test positive for COVID-19. Seeing what happened with Newton and the Patriots was a stark reminder of how fast things can change in 2020.
 The Patriots were prepared to take on the Chiefs but practiced all week with Newton as their quarterback. Having Brian Hoyer and Jarrett Stidham thrown into Arrowhead Stadium wasn't ideal -- the same goes for the results -- and it was a good reminder of what the Patriots have in Newton. Even after missing a game, Newton is still tied for sixth in the NFL in rushing touchdowns with four. With him on pace to start Sunday, the Patriots can continue to develop their offense with their new quarterback. On Thursday, Newton was back to his usual self -- firing up his teammates and dancing on the practice field. For the offense, it was nice to see after the 31-year-old had been out for 12 days with the illness.
 "He's a very vocal guy," Harry said. "[Newton] likes to have fun out there. It kind of brings back that mood -- that fun kind of mood out there. It's good."
 "[Newton brings] probably what you all see in warm-ups. He brings a ton of energy," receiver Gunner Olszewski said. "And when you all leave, I'd say he even turns it up a notch for all of us. A lot of energy. It's fun to play with."
 With Gilmore, the defense was clearly happy to have the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year back. Unlike Newton, Gilmore didn't have to wait 10 days to be cleared by doctors. Instead, his quick return suggests he tested negative twice two days in a row. Gilmore is quiet but his teammates say his play always speaks volumes.
 "He's a huge part of our defense, and any time we can have him, it definitely helps us in the long run," said linebacker John Simon. "Happy that he's back, for sure."
 After four players landed on the COVID-19/Reserve list last week, the Patriots shut down Gillette Stadium and have been slow to open up their facility. Even on Thursday, players were inside the stadium to lift weights only. Aside from practicing outside, players spent their day at home. The team held meetings virtually and even broke down film virtually.
 The Patriots have been forced to adapt during a year that's made everyone make changes. In the aftermath of a difficult week during which a game was postponed and practices were canceled, Patriots players remained focused and confident.
 In the wake of all this uncertainty, Patriots players are trying to stay positive amid a global health pandemic. This year has been strange, but football has served as a distraction for people at home and players on the field. For the players, Thursday's practice felt good because it felt normal. Having Newton and Gilmore back was also a plus.
 "It felt good just to finally be back in person, to get back in the normal routine a little bit," Harry said. "It felt great to get back out there today.

Meghan Markle dubbed the mastermind threatening Prince Harry’s UK trip
 Meghan Markle has had a rough past within the Firm and the British tabloids are dubbed the culprit in that respect, however, a new report has surfaced which pins Prince Harry’s wavering decision to return to the UK on Mgehan Markle and her past discourses within the royal household.  
 During an interview with _Sky News_ , royal expert Robert Lacey expressed these thoughts and also attributed Meghan’s troubles with the monarchy to be the reason the duo won’t be able to return to the UK for the holiday season.
 He was quoted saying, "With hindsight it's clear that the Palace, when they saw this self-made successful woman, a celebrity in her own right before she met Harry, a millionaire in her own right before she met Harry. Unlike anyone that had been before in the Royal Family, she has these dedicated believes in feminism, social change.”
 "There is the cutting edge. Her dedication to these causes caused clashes with the royal traditions of impartiality. And that's going to be one of the challenged that has to be sorted out in the future if the couple are going to come back in some way into the family."
 While international media has been back and forth in regards to Prince Harry’s return to the UK a source has come forward to lay those issues to rest once and for all.
 The source in question spoke to Vanity Fair regarding the issue and claimed, “Global travel has been made very complicated by the coronavirus pandemic and at the moment the Duke has no plans to travel back to the UK, certainly not before Christmas. The problem is if he comes over then he has to quarantine and that makes things quite difficult.”

While it would be fair to say that Melissa McCarthy comedies are rather hit and miss, with noticeably more misses in recent years, Spy stands out as one of her rousing success stories. She teams up with Bridesmaids director Paul Feig for this story about a desk-bound CIA employee who is thrust into dangerous fieldwork when her partner is killed and many more active agents are put at risk. What follows is a truly hilarious take on a Mission: Impossible- style action flick, with McCarthy on top form as well as Jason Statham in a brilliantly utilised supporting role.

Proposition 114 was placed on the ballot through a citizen initiative led by the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund. It asserts that gray wolves are endangered in Colorado; were historically an essential part of Colorado's wildlands, but were exterminated by humans; and will help restore ecological balance if they are reintroduced.

He added: ‘People have said it is kicking the can down the road, but treatment is getting better and there is a prospect of a vaccine and a low prevalence is effective because it makes everything in the system work better.’

It also caught the attention of rapper Drake. Unlike the rest of us, who have to lump it when our favourite series end, Drake worked with Netflix to finance a revival and get the original writer back on board. He even executive produces the new episodes. Series three, which sees Ashley Walters and Kane Robinson reprise their lead roles, is now available to view and a fourth is on its way. It might take you a couple of episodes to get into the style, but it’s worth it. And it’s so cool that rapper Dave has even joined the cast.

It's only in recent years that the perception of the cloud has begun to change, and there's a long way to go yet. Many people still see the cloud as vulnerable and easily hacked, but, often, the cloud is actually more secure than anything folks are doing on the ground.

The outbreaks don’t appear to originate in classrooms, but rather in places where students tend to work, socialize, and party. A recent CDC study backed this up, concluding that Covid-19 clusters in an unnamed North Carolina university were likely fueled by “student gatherings and congregate living settings, both on and off campus.”

As you can see it’s quite the mishmash of locations, ranging from big cities to small towns you probably won’t have heard of if you don’t live nearby. EE is clearly winning in terms of number of locations, though it’s also facing some stiff competition from O2 and Three.
 So if you’re looking for the most comprehensive 5G coverage, EE (or BT) is clearly the way to go. Of course O2 has quite the reach too, and its availability on Sky and Tesco gives you more choice on contracts and data plans.
 Of course 5G coverage isn’t universal, even in places where the network is available. It can change from one end of town to the other, street to street, or even depending on whether you’re inside or not. So make sure to check out coverage maps _before_ you commit to a network.
 _EE_, _O2_, _Three_, and Vodafone all have their own maps, but if you’d rather not have to keep switching between different network websites check out _nperf’s map_. That map doesn’t let you toggle off 2G, 3G, or 4G, but it does let you swap between networks at the click of a button — which could prove very useful.
 ## What about iPhone 12 and 700MHz?
 Thankfully buying the iPhone 12 shouldn’t be an issue. There had been some pre-launch rumours that the phone wouldn’t support the 700Mhz 5G band, which while not in use in the UK just yet is still expected to play a key role in expanding 5G coverage — on account of its long range. Fortunately _Apple’s specs_ tell a different story, and promise that all four iPhone 12 models will support 700Mhz (along with several other layers of the 5G spectrum) in the U.K.
