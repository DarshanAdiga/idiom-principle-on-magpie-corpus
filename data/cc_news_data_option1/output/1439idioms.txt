While some banks were slow to get the necessary infrastructure up and running to accept applications, the problems were further compounded by technological issues at the SBA, bankers said. It is taking more than an hour to submit each application to the SBA, the industry group executive said.
 “These systems are not built for massive volumes,” said Karen Kerrigan, president of the advocacy group Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council.
 Furthermore, not every bank could use the SBA’s E-Tran system, leaving many community banks unable to help their clients.

At the conclusion of the hearing, Barry-Smith, calling it “a unique set of circumstances,” shaved three months off of Perrot’s 18-month jail term.
 The judge said that while he doesn’t believe the Middleton Jail is especially dangerous, even with an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, “it is more dangerous than being released to a home where social distancing will be easier to achieve.”
 The hearing was one of 10 being conducted remotely Friday in Salem Superior Court.
 The situation took on new urgency last week after Sheriff Kevin Coppinger confirmed the existence of an outbreak at the facility that has resulted in at least 14 inmates and seven staff members testing positive as of Friday.
 An hour or so after Perrot’s hearing, a lawyer for Jeremiah Weatherbee-Pike, 41, asked Judge James Lang to reconsider his $60,000 bail in light of the pandemic.
 Weatherbee-Pike, of Danvers, is awaiting trial on charges of possessing child pornography.
 His lawyer, Patrick Regan, argued that his client has been in a dormitory- style housing unit, where, he said, conditions are “not exactly adequate” for Weatherbee-Pike to protect himself.
 Assistant attorney general Lynn Brennan argued that Weatherbee-Pike, with sex offenses on his record, is a risk to the public. And Brennan was concerned by something he wrote in a journal he was required to keep as part of his sex offender treatment in an earlier case.
 “The defendant specifically wrote that his ‘red flags were isolating myself in the house and stress,’ and that is exactly what is going on in the world right now,” Brennan argued.
 Lang denied the motion.

NEW YORK (AP) — Desperate small business owners who hoped for a quick government lifeline to help them survive the coronavirus crisis are still without funds, instead battling red tape, wary banks and swamped computer systems.
 Thousands of owners who applied for loans under the government's Paycheck Protection Program are in their second week of waiting for their money.
 And thousands who sought relief through Small Business Administration economic injury disaster loans have waited even longer — some since mid-March.

FIFA has confirmed all four pots for the 2018 World Cup finals draw will be allocated based on the governing body's world rankings.
 The move represents a change from previous editions, where only Pot 1 was determined by teams' positions in the standings with the remaining grouped by Confederations.
 But the decision taken by the Organising Committee for FIFA Competitions means all 32 teams will be seeded based on their positions in the October rankings.
 FIFA, though, will continue to insist no more than one Confederation is in a single group.
 Hosts Russia will be automatically seeded in Pot 1 alongside the other top- seven nations, while Brazil's spot is also guaranteed given they have already qualified and are guaranteed to be ranked in the top seven.
 Germany, Argentina and Portugal will also take a place in the main group should they qualify, but the race to join that quintet looks set to go down to the wire.
 Pot 2 looks set to be equally strong, with England, France, Spain and Italy among those likely to be involved.

Former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba believes Alvaro Morata has already begun to live up to expectations at Stamford Bridge.
 The Spain international, signed from Real Madrid for a reported club-record fee of £60million in July, has registered three goals and two assists in his first four appearances in the Premier League.
 The 24-year-old opened the scoring in the 2-1 win over Leicester City on Saturday, a result that lifted Chelsea to within a point of leaders Manchester United, and is in line to make his first outing for the club in the Champions League against Qarabag on Tuesday.
 Drogba, who scored 164 goals during a glittering career with the club, has been hugely impressed by Morata's start to life in London.
 "He is scoring goals that are winning games so I am really happy for him and for the club as well," Drogba told Sky Sports News.
 "It is very important to score. As a striker, when you start with a new team, people have high expectations.
 "When you match those expectations, you are just happy and the goals continue to come.
 "I hope he will have a great season because we need that."
 N'Golo Kante struck what proved to be the winner against his former club, prompting head coach Antonio Conte to hail his form as evidence that he is the top flight's best player.
 "He doesn't score much but when he does everyone is happy for him because he is working a lot for the team and giving everything," Drogba said of the midfielder.
 "I was proud that he scored his goal. It was a very difficult game. It is always difficult to play at Leicester so I am happy with the result."

I believe grassroots sport is going to be equally important in reuniting communities once the threat of coronavirus has passed.
 One of the toughest things about the situation we’re in now is that it has divided us. First, we were divided into countries as borders across the world were closed, then cities as movement became restricted and then in many cases we have had to divide into individual households.

A country learns about itself in a crisis, and one revelation in the coronavirus emergency is that we can’t make our own penicillin.
 The first patient successfully treated with the antibiotic was a woman suffering from sepsis in a Connecticut hospital in 1942. Her treatment took up half the country’s supply. Yet in short order we figured out how to mass produce the medicine, saving the lives of countless soldiers in World War II. Once, factories throughout the country made the stuff.
 But that was a long time ago. The last U.S. plant to make penicillin, a Bristol-Myers Squibb operation in Syracuse, New York, shuttered in 2004.
 What happened? According to Rosemary Gibson of The Hastings Center and author of the book “China Rx,” “Industry data reveal that Chinese companies formed a cartel, colluded to sell product on the global market at below market price, and drove all U.S., European and Indian producers out of business.”
 When European firms tried to sell their penicillin ingredients in China, they got a characteristic Chinese welcome: The government, Gibson writes, “imposed high trade barriers, charged astronomical fees for product testing, and held foreign firms to a higher standard than domestic ones.”
 Just like that — it’s not so easy to simply start up a penicillin fermenter — we were out of the penicillin-production business.
 The story of penicillin is the tale of U.S. dependence on China-sourced pharmaceuticals and active drug ingredients writ large.
 From 2010 to 2018, U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals from China increased 75%. China is the second largest exporter of drugs and biologics to the United States behind Canada, and our dependence is even greater, given that China is the source of the active ingredients of many drugs produced elsewhere. India, another major source of drugs for the U.S., gets about 75% of its active ingredients from China.
 China is a dominant force when it comes to generic drugs in particular, which account for the vast majority of medicines that American take. We rely on China for 90% of our antibiotics, and for drugs for everything from HIV/AIDS to cancer to antidepressants.
 China is fully aware of its leverage. It notoriously threatened via its state- run media to cut off our supply of drugs (except fentanyl, of course) and plunge the U.S. into “the mighty sea of coronavirus.”
 Even if China weren’t a malign global competitor (it is), a remorseless dictatorship (it is) or a dishonest kleptocracy (it is), there would be risk inherent in having so many of our medications and their components coming from one country. We become vulnerable to any disruption of Chinese production, whether from disease, political unrest or war.
 Beijing is a particularly nasty actor, but the coronavirus has demonstrated that even friendly nations will keep medical supplies from one other if it is in their self-interest to do so.
 It is only prudent, then, that the U.S. begin a national effort to produce more of its own medicines. It’s not as though China’s advantage in this area is the result of a policy of strict laissez-faire. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review commission attributes China’s success to “government subsidies, a robust chemical industry, IP theft, lax environmental protections, and regulations favoring domestic companies.”
 Unspooling supply chains that have developed over the course of the past two decades won’t be simple. The U.S. should create every incentive for drug companies to at least move out of China into other foreign countries, and ideally come back here (economic incentives clearly matter — when drug companies lost tax preferences to manufacture in Puerto Rico, many of them left for China). Eventually, federally funded health systems, including Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration, should buy only American- sourced pharmaceuticals.
 Prescient commentators have been warning of our growing dependence on China for medicines for years. After this, there’s no excuse for not fixing it.

 "Yes it's hard lines about Kitchener, but I think they have a good man in Robertson. Sorry to hear that the work has dropped off again but hope you will get enough to keep you going.
 "Well, Mother Dear. I can see from Eve's letter that you are no better but if you will keep on worrying you never will be.
 "Try and occupy your mind more and don't sit and brood; there's nothing to be gained by brooding.
 "I don't know what the people in England think but I don't think the war will last much longer. We are getting very funny weather; a drop of rain and a bit of frost, all sorts in about 5 minutes.
 "Well I am in the best of health and hope both of you will be by the time you get this.

Arsene Wenger will continue to fight for his Arsenal future despite going through a "tough time" at the club, believes former defender Kolo Toure.
 The centre-back was part of the famous 'Invincibles' side that made history by going the entirety of the 2003-04 Premier League season without suffering a single defeat.
 Wenger, who signed a two-year contract extension in May, has come under fire again after a poor start to the season, with Arsenal losing back-to-back matches against Stoke City and Liverpool.
 But Toure, who helped Celtic to win a domestic treble last season, believes Wenger can turn things around at Emirates Stadium.
 "He's done a lot for Arsenal," Toure told a Soccerex panel on Wednesday. "The thing with Wenger is he is someone who can see talent in young players, if you look at players he made shine it’s amazing.
 "Right now it is a tough time but he's a fantastic manager. He loves the club, that's why he's still there, he wants the best for this club, he will fight until he decides [to leave]."
 Toure is a free agent having left Celtic at the end of his contract, with the former Ivory Coast international mulling over the chance to follow Wenger into coaching by joining Brendan Rodgers' backroom staff at the Scottish champions.
 "Yes, I am [considering a coaching role with Celtic] at the moment," Toure said. "I am at a point where I need to make a decision. It is always difficult to stop playing, it is what I love and I still want to play, but 36 is a lot!
 "Now I take the next step which is coaching, I want to stay in the game, I want to help young players, give them my experience and advice to get better.
 "I learned from [Thierry] Henry, [Dennis] Bergkamp, [Martin] Keown, [Sol] Campbell and I want to help young players improve themselves, because it is a beautiful game.
 "I was thinking I could do another job, but I soon realised what I'd been learning was football. And the way I can express myself is in football.
 "I just took the decision, I was thinking about going into finance, but you will make mistakes and need time to learn, but in football I have a lot of experience, I have learned from coaches and it is much easier for me to find a way."

National medical director Stephen Powis said: "I am humbled by the overwhelming response by the thousands of former doctors returning to the frontline and would like to thank everyone who has signed up, they will make a huge difference at a time when our country needs it most.
 "But no matter how many staff return to the frontline, the NHS will only be able to cope if everyone plays their part and supports our frontline heroes, by staying at home and washing their hands."
 The response from former staff comes after NHS leaders issued an appeal to all clinical staff who left the profession during the past three years to come back.
 NHS England said that the General Medical Council (GMC) was helping to widen the search by extending its register so that those who left the service between four and six years ago can return as well.
 The Nursing and Midwifery Council is due to follow suit later this week with similar measures for nurses and midwives who left the profession four or five years ago, it added.

 “We know it’s going to be significant, but I’m not prepared or comfortable yet putting out hard numbers,’’ Barta said. “I anticipate most everybody will be involved in it.’’
 He said the only dollar figure that will not be reduced is the 13-to-14 million dollars the athletic department pays the university annually to fund scholarships for its student-athletes.
 Barta added completion of the newly-constructed clubhouse at the Finkbine Golf Course and planning for a new wrestling facility, funded by donations, will proceed while all future capital improvement projects have been put on hold for the time being.
