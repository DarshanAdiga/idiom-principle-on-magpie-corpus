Days six and seven were spent reimagining the best versions of myself. I made a list of everything I wanted to accomplish by the end of quarantine. I learned how to draw my eyebrows on and twist my hair. I discovered TikTok and quickly learned that yes, I was “Savage” like Megan Thee Stallion, but I’d leave the moves to Gen Z. I made a vision board to plot my world domination. Even added a little glitter for artistic flavor.
 And on Day Eight, I remembered that brain fluid was still leaking out of my left nostril. And sometimes, my right nostril. I remembered that brain fluid has been leaking from my skull into my ears and nose for three years, as doctors ignored me and gaslit me.
 So at 2 a.m. on Day Eight, I let myself feel the weight of the last few years. I downed a bottle of cheap prosecco (sorry, Mom) alone in my apartment, and I let myself feel it all. I bawled my eyes out. I drunk-called my boyfriend for a pep talk. I FaceTimed my best friends and family for support. I blared Beyoncé and Afrobeats and danced on top of my Ikea futon.
 And by dawn, I looked in the mirror and began to see someone who resembled a person I knew three years ago. But those tears weren’t just for me. They were for Sha-Asia Washington, Kira Johnson and the thousands of Black women who were never heard or seen by the healthcare system.

The incidents took place at a time when no search and rescue ship is present in the central Mediterranean Sea because the civil fleet remains blocked in European ports. On Friday 23 October, the NGO Sea-Watch appealed against the blockade of its rescue vessel Sea-Watch 4 that is ongoing since mid-September to the administrative court in Palermo. Sea-Watch Chairman Johannes Bayer commented this step: “We must not get used to rescue ships being illegally blocked and Europe letting people drown as a deterrent. Those who fight for human rights must do so at all levels. This is why we filed an appeal against the arbitrary blockade of Sea-Watch 4. We are not only morally right; our ships are safe and ready to rescue”. On 28 October, inspectors of the classification agency were on board the Sea Watch 4 and once more reassured that the ship is safe according to flag state and international regulations. But the blockade by Italian authorities continues. The organisation’s monitoring aircraft Moonbird was finally released by Italian authorities after being grounded for almost two months. During its first mission on Monday, the aircraft crew located a boat in distress carrying men, women and children without life jackets in Maltese SAR zone. One of the two engines had stopped working, making it impossible to maintain course. As confirmed by Alarm Phone, the 87 passengers were rescued by Italian coastguard and disembarked in Lampedusa.

Opponents of the measure include the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, which has spent more than $3.5 million on campaign advertising on TV and social media aimed at convincing the public that Measure J’s goal is to essentially defund the police.
 “Measure J could mean deep cuts to vital services like 911 emergency response, public health nurses and first responders,” the narrator says in one ad.
 Supervisor Sheila Kuehl, one of four supervisors on the five-person board who back the measure, said there isn’t a “shred of truth” in the No on J campaign ads that claim essential workers will be harmed.
 Kuehl said jobs based in punishment, such as the Sheriff’s Department detention officers in county jails, are becoming an outdated concept that has proved to be ineffective in curbing crime. “Punishment has not really worked well for society, and society is saying more, and louder, ‘We would like to try another way,’ and that’s what this reform is about,” Kuehl said.

James Maddison has warned Leicester they must expect rough treatment in the Europa League after their win at AEK Athens.
 The Foxes maintained their perfect start to Group G after a 2-1 victory in Greece on Thursday.
 Jamie Vardy’s penalty and Hamza Choudhury’s first goal since January sealed the win despite Muamer Tankovic pulling a goal back in the second half.
 They remain joint top with Braga, who visit the King Power Stadium next week, and Maddison is ready for more bruising encounters.
 "It’s a convincing start, two from two, it couldn’t have gone better," he told the club’s official website. "I got fouled a lot, personally, and a few of the other lads did as well, but that’s what happens in Europe.
 "You know, sometimes you don’t get those fouls where you would in the Premier League and vice versa.
 "It’s just about getting up and carrying on, still wanting the ball, still showing that bravery to get on the ball, even when you get kicked, and I think we did that. We were excellent in midfield.
 "It’s a really good start to the group. We said prior to the game last week at home that we wanted to get off to a good start and we did in convincing fashion, a 3-0 win.
 "Then we’ve come away to what is a tough place to come again and, watching the clips on the iPads from the analysts, we knew it was going to be a tough game.
 "We started the game very well and that was important. We came out the blocks quite quickly, created a few chances and managed to see the game out, after they had a little rally in the second half."
 Vardy struck from the spot in the 18th minute after he was brought down by Panagiotis Tsintotas and Choudhury then fired in Maddison’s corner.
 Tarkovic’s goal early in the second half made the Foxes sweat and the former Fulham forward missed a fine chance to make it 2-2.
 But Leicester recorded a third straight win ahead of Monday’s Premier League trip to Leeds.
 "It gives us really good confidence as a group," Choudhury told LCFCTV. "Coming away in Europe is really difficult, so we’re just going to push on now and try and win every game.
 "I think that’s been drilled into us now by the gaffer that every game is as important as the last, so we’ll go into the two games that we’ve got against Braga looking to get another six points.
 "We just want to build and build and hopefully have a successful run in this tournament."

Cries of “Death to France” rang out in Afghanistan’s capital of Kabul and several other provinces as thousands filled the streets. Demonstrators trampled on portraits of Macron and called on Afghan leaders to shut down the French embassy, halt French imports and ban French citizens from visiting the country. In the country’s western Herat province, protesters hoisted an effigy of Macron on a crane and set it alight.
 Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hezb-i-Islami, an Islamist party, warned Macron that if he doesn’t “control the situation, we are going to a third world war and Europe will be responsible.”
 Muslims also rallied outside the Middle East, with a huge crowd of some 50,000 noisily chanting protesters in Bangladesh’s capital of Dhaka burning effigies of Macron and holding signs that read, “Say no to Islamophobia,” “Stop racism,” and “Boycott French products.” Several hundred protested peacefully in Ethiopia’s capital after Friday prayers.
 Within Europe and globally, France’s hardline response to a string of attacks that French authorities attribute to Muslim extremism has reignited a debate that pits the country’s strict secularism and free speech laws against Islamic religious sensitivities.
 Over the past week, protests and calls to boycott French products have spread rapidly from Bangladesh to Pakistan to Kuwait. Social media has been pulsing with anti-France hashtags. Muslim leaders, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in particular, have loudly criticized France for what they see as the government’s provocative and anti-Muslim stance.
 Thursday's attack in Nice also drew condemnations from leaders of countries that had voiced outrage over the caricatures, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Egypt.

And in Afghanistan, members of the Islamist party Hezb-i-Islami set the French flag ablaze. Its leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, warned Macron that if he doesn’t “control the situation, we are going to a third world war and Europe will be responsible.”
 The protests come amid rising tensions between France and Muslim-majority nations, which flared up earlier this month when a young Muslim extremist beheaded a French schoolteacher who had shown caricatures of the Muhammad in class.
 Those images, republished by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to mark the opening of the trial for the deadly 2015 terrorist attack against the publication, have stirred the ire of Muslims across the world who consider depictions of the prophet blasphemous.

“I know taxes are expensive and it means taking a few acres out of production,” Olson said, “but if you can get in a program that will pay you to do it, it’s worth it.”
 District conservationist Andy Bohnenkamp said that although Olson isn’t the biggest operator he works with, he “undoubtedly” makes the biggest impact. Olson has adopted a variety of conservation practices to decrease erosion, protect water quality and increase soil health.
 Cover crops of grasses, vegetables like radishes and turnips, small grains and legumes are planted in the off-season to increase the soil’s ability to hold water and sediment. No-till has been used on his corn and soybean fields for more than 20 years. Terracing has made sloped farm fields more manageable.
 In 2017, the Olsons were among the first landowners to participate in Nebraska’s Corners for Wildlife program that established one- to three-acre plots of pollinator habitat at rural intersections. Sewn with wildflowers, these plantings benefit bees and butterflies, and they keep drivers safe during summer months when corn fields would otherwise limit visibility.
 “And the wildflowers just explode in the summer,” Olson said
 They have planted about 4,000 trees and shrubs to create windbreaks, and provide food sources and corridors for wildlife. Such efforts earned them a Legacy Award from Pheasants Forever, Quail Forever and the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2015.
 While the plantings have created a rich diversity of wildlife, from songbirds to deer, the work also has had a positive impact on his favorite outdoor pursuit — pheasant hunting.
 “We’d been told that you’ll never see pheasant in northeast Nebraska again,” he said. “But they’re coming back.
 “If you give them a place to live, they’ll come.”
 Off the farm, Olson has spent his entire adulthood fostering conservation ethics and a respect for the land among hunters and farmers. He co-founded the Burt County Pheasants Forever chapter and educates landowners on how to enhance pheasant habitat by planting natural food sources on abandoned farmsteads and fence lines. As owner of Olson Pearson Auctions & Realty, he donates his time auctioneering at conservation events.
 His strongest passion is sharing his knowledge with youth. He teaches youth firearm safety and outdoor ethics as an instructor for the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission’s Hunter Education Program and as a volunteer with Pheasant Forever’s Youth Mentor Hunt. As a former 4-H wildlife habitat team leader, he provided hands-on experience to youth building goose nests and wood duck boxes.

Working through Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations has been tricky. The FAA classifies drones used in this way in the same category as cropdusters, Ott said. Some early hiccups that amused Ott came in the form of seatbelt regulations that required their drone pilots, who often are completely stationary on the ground, wear seatbelts while operating the drones.
 The major benefit to the three-drone swarm – which Rantizo is actively lobbying to increase to a five-drone swarm – is that the system can hover over precise locations in a field down to inch-level accuracy.
 “We apply without soil compaction, can fly into rain, can have multiple units,” he said.
 The benefits of drones are being felt in South Dakota. Williams said he has already received requests to spray in places like pastures, or around conservation ground, where farmers and producers don’t want to drag heavy equipment through just to solve one problem.
 “It’s hard to find people who will spray and run ground rigs in that,” Williams said.
 The drones are roughly 6 feet in diameter when the booms are fully extended. The swarm can cover large amounts of ground using multiple battery packs.
 So far, the Williams’ have put on several cover crop demonstrations and done a handful of spray applications since August as more customers look to see just how a swarm of drones could replace the tried and true tractor methods. Williams said at one of the demos, people ended up pulling up alongside the road and getting out of their car to watch the drones work.
 Up next for the Williams Drone fleet would be adding more, should regulations ease on the drone use, and getting a mix and fill station to automatically mix chemicals for the drones. Both Williams and Ott said that in the next few years, they expect their drone rigs to replace any commercial sprayer in the field.
 For now, Williams said he is happy that he can quickly get in and out of problem areas for his fellow farmers and help them spray what needs to be sprayed.

Plandisc is compatible with Microsoft Teams and Sharepoint and the synchronisation between Outlook and Plandisc means that important meetings and events can be transferred across in a few clicks, so no "copy and pasting" required with changes appearing both in Outlook and the Plandisc at the same time.  Typically embedded on an organisation's intranet to make it accessible to all staff, the circular overview helps coordinate plans between academic departments as well as sports, events and marketing activity.  With a circular view, it is easy to spot overlapping activities and make sure that staff meetings, parent days and virtual open days for example are distributed evenly throughout the year. As Stigaard explains "Sharing information via Plandisc in business as usual times avoids last-minute changes of plans and extra workload but now, with so much activity that was paused during lockdown needing to restart, there is even more need for better planning as an educational establishment cannot suddenly implement all paused activity at the same time whilst still having the flexibility update plans easily and efficiently as circumstances change."

"L’aggravarsi della situazione generale, con la pandemia da Covid-19 che mostra quotidianamente numeri sempre più preoccupanti, ha indotto la FIDAL ad annullare lo svolgimento, previsto a Trieste il 22 novembre prossimo, dei Campionati Italiani assoluti di corsa campestre. La manifestazione, prevista nella prima stesura del calendario nazionale 2020 alla data del 3 marzo a Campi Bisenzio (Firenze, nella formula denominata “Festa del Cross”, comprensiva dei titoli di categoria), era stata sospesa all’emergere del contagio, per poi essere spostata a Trieste, il 22 novembre, in occasione della già prevista “Carsolina” (ma solo per le prove assolute). L’emergere di quella che gli specialisti definiscono “seconda ondata” del virus, ha determinato dapprima l’annullamento delle attività di preparazione delle squadre nazionali, e adesso, purtroppo, anche degli Assoluti di cross. Un’ultima considerazione va spesa per la città di Trieste, che resta sede di assoluto valore, idonea – ora ed in futuro – all’organizzazione di eventi di questo livello".

--DocBreak--
Tutto il mio folle amore, film diretto da Gabriele Salvatores, è ambientato a Trieste, dove vive Vincent (Giulio Pranno), un sedicenne chiuso in un universo tutto suo, affetto da una forma di autismo e da un disturbo della personalità sin dalla nascita. Proprio a causa della sua situazione, questi ultimi sedici anni non sono stati facili per nessuno, né per il ragazzo stesso né per sua madre Elena (Valeria Golino), che ha dovuto confrontarsi giorno dopo giorno con i problemi causati dai disturbi del figlio. Ad aiutare la donna è arrivato col tempo il suo compagno, Mario (Diego Abatantuono), che ha trattato sin da subito il giovane come suo figlio, adottandolo. Quello che si viene a creare nella famiglia è una sorta di equilibrio, seppur molto precario, nel quale i due adulti riescono tra alti e bassi a gestire Vincent. In questa situazione delicata irrompe una sera Willi (Claudio Santamaria), padre naturale del giovane e cantante squattrinato, che ha abbandonato Elena nel momento stesso in cui ha saputo che era incinta. In procinto di partire per un tour nei Balcani, l'uomo vuole conoscere il figlio che non ha mai visto, ma non immagina neanche lontanamente la situazione che si ritroverà davanti. Vincent, però, vede nel padre e nel suo furgone un tentativo di fuga e, nascosto nel veicolo, parte insieme a Willi, all'insaputa di quest'ultimo. L'occasione permette ai due di conoscersi meglio e approfondire quel legame di sangue che hanno ignorato per sedici lunghi anni. In questo viaggio nei Balcani e nei sentimenti, Willi e Vincent avranno modo di confrontarsi e parlare, così come Elena e Mario, partiti alla ricerca del figlio.

CARVER -- Without a 2020 postseason tournament, the 5-2-1 Crusaders wrapped up the season Tuesday night in Randolph with a 2-2 tie, but their 7-0 Senior Day victory against Middleboro on Saturday was the most noteworthy of the shortened season - and it didn't come without a remarkable career achievement.
 Senior Mike Sawicki entered his final home game on Saturday with 95 career points, and left the turf with 101. He scored four goals and racked up two assists in the win, relieving all the pressure from him, his teammates, and coaches to make sure he surpassed the 100 point mark before the condensed season concluded.
 "There was definitely a little bit of pressure because in the back of your head, you kind of know, you need five points. You just have to treat it one goal at a time, one assist at a time, and it'll get done, like it did," Sawicki said postgame.
 "It's one of those things that from the very beginning, we thought it was a possibility," head oach Mark Alessandri said, "With each season that passed, he just kept improving and getting better and getting better. Again, right when we get to the end here, it was one of those things where we were just like, 'Okay, let's get it for him.' I'm really happy for him, really proud of him, and he deserves it."
 Carver was firing on all cylinders in the win. Senior goalie Justin Ritz pitched a shutout in his final home game, and the scoring came from all over the senior cast. Cam Besegai put one through in the first half, as well as Captain Codan Foley, and Dom Craig got into the action to put the finishing touches on the win in the waning moments. It was a statement performance from a senior class that wanted to end the jeopardized season on a high note.
 This senior group is one of the most unique in program history. First off, with 10 seniors, it's one of the largest. Second, they came into the program several years ago and had to grow up on the spot. Four years ago, when this group came in as freshmen, there weren't any seniors on the team. It forced them to be the leaders from the beginning, and with that came increased playing time, allowing them to attain the experience needed to compete at the highest stakes later in their soccer careers. Foley reflected on what those early years were like and how they helped mold the team that took the field this year.
 "It was very welcoming my freshman year," said Foley. "Cole (Berry), Farq (Brandon Farquharson), Ben Vitale, they welcomed me in, and then C.J. (Vincent) taught me what it was like to be here. Me, Sawicki, Dom, and Alex (Berkobein), we grew up and went right into it and started playing great. We grew up playing together and we meshed. Now, we have 10 seniors, so it just works well."
 Alessandri proudly reminisced, "Going back to when they were freshmen, we talked about this. Their freshman year, we had no seniors. We talked about this that, every year, we're building for when you guys are seniors. We had the one year with Cole as a senior, and we had (last year) with the three seniors. This was something that was a progression. We got more and more competitive each year and that was the idea. The potential they had back then was very clear and it's nice to see that it's been realized."
 The process of even getting through a fall athletics season came with its fair share of new challenges and regulations, but the highlight of the season for the school has been seeing each and every one of their seniors get cherished by their teams one final time on their home turf.
 Alessandri continued, "We talked at various points in the season. Obviously, we knew that at any moment, it could've ended. It was nice to see it happen for these guys, they are such a great group. It would've been devastating if they didn't get (a Senior Day celebration), so to have a day like this weather-wise, to get a day like this for the way they performed, it's a nice way for them to finish out their careers here."

Posted by Boston University Athletics on&nbsp;Thursday, October 29, 2020Roy was a 20-year-old freshman making his debut for the reigning NCAA champions in the 1995-96 season opener when he crashed headfirst into the boards after checking a North Dakota opponent.The accident left him a quadriplegic.From his wheelchair, he gave as many as 40 motivational speeches a year. The message he shared: Do the best with what you have and don’t dwell on your misfortune.“I like to say the first 20 years I had a life that was full of passion and the last 20 I’ve had a life full of purpose,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press shortly after turning 40. “The dream is to have both at the same time, but I’m fortunate. I’ll take either one.”Since he created the Travis Roy Foundation in 1997, it has raised more than $9 million — half for research, and half to provide equipment for those with spinal cord injuries. Roy, who was able to control the joystick that maneuvered his chair, regained little movement after the injury and had no feeling below the middle of his chest. “I just thought the research would move along and by the time I was 40 I might have a chance of some normalcy again,” Roy told the AP in 2015, “some kids and a wife and not living with 24-hour home care anymore.”The hockey world mourned his passing on Thursday, with the NHL calling Roy “a special man who responded to his devastating injury by dedicating himself to serving others.”Former Bruins star and current team president Cam Neely also shared his condolences.“Travis Roy was the ultimate symbol of determination and courage,” Neely said. “The impact that Travis had on the New England hockey community is immeasurable, and his relentless advocacy for spinal cord research was inspiring.”Ray Bourque, another ex-Bruin and Hockey Hall of Famer, said he and his wife were “honored to have known such a great man who helped so many others.” “The warmth, strength, and resiliency he exhibited in the face of tragedy set him apart,” Boston Red Sox President and CEO Sam Kennedy said. “His mantra was never to take anything for granted, and his message resonates stronger than ever with all of us at the Red Sox.”Roy’s work as a fund-raiser and motivational speaker combined with his persistent optimism to make him a hero to other victims of spinal cord injuries.“Travis Roy, you were my friend, mentor, role model and the most positive person I knew,” Jack Jablonski, a Minnesota high school hockey star who was also left paralyzed after a hockey collision, said on Twitter. “You have forever changed the SCI and hockey community. Thank you for taking the time to get to know each other.”Denna Laing, who was paralyzed during an exhibition before the 2016 NHL Winter Classic, also tweeted her thanks.“Travis did so many little things and big things for so many people,” she wrote. “This is gutting, really truly sad.”The son of a Maine hockey rink manager who began skating when he was 20 months old, Roy went to North Yarmouth Academy and Tabor Academy before enrolling at BU. Both high schools have named their rinks after him.BU retired Roy’s No. 24 in 1999; he graduated from the school with a degree in communications the next spring. “I think all the time how grateful I am,” Roy told the AP on the 20th anniversary of the injury. “The thing that goes through my mind every once in a while is, ‘Thank God it wasn’t a brain injury.’ I don’t want any pity.”He said he occasionally thought about what might have happened if he hadn’t been injured.“There’s times when it’s kind of fun to think about it,” he said. “It’s also kind of sad to not know the answer.”Among the players on the 1995-96 BU Terriers team were future NHLers Chris Drury, Jay Pandolfo, Shawn Bates and Mike Grier. John Hynes is now the coach of the Nashville Predators. Coach Jack Parker is an inductee in the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame; Olympic hero Mike Eruzione was an assistant coach.“It’s so sad for so many reasons — not just the athletic end of it, but what his life could have been,” Eruzione told the AP on Thursday night. "To see a life changed in such a direction because of 11 seconds. “But what he did with it afterward was incredible,” Eruzione added. "Such an inspiration. He could have folded the tent. He could have said, ‘This is it.’ But he chose another path in his life, and he raised millions of dollars. “It just sucks, that at 45, that it’s over.” ___Former AP Sports Writer Howard Ulman contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The Covid-19 pandemic has an adverse impact on Indian sports. However, the organizers of the Indian Super League (ISL) and the All India Football Federation (AIFF) have managed to find ways to work through the lockdown. The ISL 2020-21 season will be played behind closed doors in Goa, with all teams playing at the three chosen stadiums.
 While the GMC Stadium in Bambolim will host the ISL 2020/21 season opener between ATK Mohun Bagan and Kerala Blasters, the Tilak Maidan Stadium in Vasco will host the second fixture between NorthEast United FC and Mumbai City FC.
 The Tilak Maidan is one of three venues for the ISL this season in Goa along with the GMC and Fatorda. Over the years, the Tilak Maidan has been predominantly used for footballing purposes and is managed by the Sports Authority of India (SAI).
 The ground serves as a home venue for Goan club Churchill Brothers, and has also played host to Indian Arrows, SC Dempo, and Sporting Club de Goa. Salgaocar Football Club used the Tilak Maidan as their home venue from 2006 to 2016. The ground has also hosted a bevy of cup matches, most notably from the Federation Cup in the recent past.
 ## 15 ISL matches to be played in the Tilak Maidan
 With just three venues for the entire season, the Tilak Maidan will host 15 matches for the first leg of the competition. The first one will be played between NorthEast United and Mumbai City on the 21st of November, with the last match played between FC Goa and Hyderabad FC on the 30th of November.
 Among the fixtures hosted at this venue, the most notable of the lot will be the Kolkata Derby between SC East Bengal and ATK Mohun Bagan on the 27th of November. This will be the first time the Kolkata Derby is being played in the history of the Indian Super League.

 # Puget Sound Energy's Colstrip coal plant sale falls through
 Associated Press
 SEATTLE (AP) — A deal to sell Puget Sound Energy's stake in one of the four generating units in Montana's Colstrip coal plant has fallen through.
 In announcing the deal in December, PSE said the sale of generating capacity in Colstrip Unit 4 to NorthWestern Energy and Talen Montana would help them meet a 2025 deadline to have a coal-free energy supply.
 But the transaction, which also included the sale of PSE's interest in a Montana transmission line, needed the approval of the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission. And its staff this month recommended the sale be rejected because PSE had not shown this was the lowest, reasonable cost option for meeting the requirements of the Washington law to have a coal-free energy supply by 2025, The Seattle Times reported.
 NorthWestern, which provides electricity in Montana, said that the sale would have addressed a "critical capacity shortage" when power demand is high and called the cancelation a "huge loss for Montana and our customers."
 NorthWestern said Thursday it agreed with Puget Sound Energy to end the transaction to buy 92.5 megawatts of capacity generation at Colstrip Unit 4 and a more interest in the Colstrip Transmission System from Puget.
 “This is a huge loss for Montana and our customers,” NorthWestern Energy Vice President Energy Supply and Montana Government Affairs John Hines said in an email. “We pursued this agreement because it provided a way to immediately address some of our critical capacity shortage at a very low cost. In addition, it created a reserve fund to address the environmental costs for NorthWestern Energy’s existing share of Colstrip Unit 4, which would have benefited our Montana customers."
 He said the deal would have let them add transmission assets to import and export energy to and from Montana.
 Colstrip's two older, smaller units — 1 and 2 — owned by PSE and Talen Montana shut down earlier this year.
 Under the terms of the sale, PSE would have sold its ownership in Unit 4 and then bought back some power from the unit until 2025, while continuing to hold a stake in Colstrip's Unit 3.
 PSE and the other companies must develop a new plan for what happens after 2025.
 "It became increasingly evident that there was enough opposition or misplaced opposition to this transaction that it necessitated withdrawing the application at this time," said Janet Kim, a PSE spokeswoman. "PSE wants a solution and we want to get off coal as quickly as possible. We remain no less committed to this and will immediately return to the negotiating table to explore options with the other owners."
 Colstrip, in southeast Montana, has strong political support in the state, and in the community of Colstrip, which has relied on the plant's jobs.
 But the facility has been buffeted by changing energy markets as natural gas, wind and solar power have ramped up generation.
 The Montana Environmental Information Center (MEIC) called it "great news for Montana."
 Anne Hedges, deputy director of MEIC, said consumers would "have been saddled with the costs, risks, and environmental harm posed by this expensive and aging coal plant.”
 MEIC is a party in the docket before the Montana Public Service Commission reviewing NorthWestern’s proposal to purchase more of Colstrip Unit 4.

Finnish National Opera is back in business. The company took advantage of Helsinki’s admirable control of the coronavirus and in September began presenting live opera and dance in full productions with a live, distanced audience and some starry performers, the soprano Karita Mattila included.
 This has included a new production now being streamed for free on Opera Vision. The titles come on for “Valkyyria” — a new production of Wagner’s “Die Walküre” — but the first thing you hear is what sounds like an audience coughing up a storm. Already, you know we’re in trouble. The storm music for the prelude packs a punch, but then a disgruntled customer “interface manager” steps in.
 “Hey, little guy down there,” she yells at the conductor in the pit. “Stop it with Wagner! Play Mozart!”
 The little guy happens to be Esa-Pekka Salonen (whose “Walküre,” postponed in the spring, is now set for January). The Mozart is “Covid fan Tutte,” an outrageous operatic spoof of “Cosi fan Tutte.” With spikes of COVID-19 the world over, this is clearly no time for a kidding around. Or is it?

HANOVER -- The Starland Sportsplex & Fun Park in Hanover wants to add a new attraction, a zip line, but getting a variance for the required 135-foot tower, 100 feet taller than regulations normally allow, could be major barrier.
 Hanover Zoning Board of Appeals member Fred Adami said during a Wednesday meeting that the park must show that not granting the variance would be a substantial hardship, especially since getting a 100-foot variance is "unprecedented."

 The park's attorney, Steven Guard, said Starland needs to continue to grow and add new attractions, otherwise, it will begin to atrophy.
 "Without the relief from the height restriction, it prevents sustainable long- term growth," he said.
 Guard compared the park to a restaurant -- the menu has to change from time to time.
 "If you're in a rut and the public finds there aren't new things, the public is going to stop coming," he said.
 Owner Frank Teixeira said fun parks are hard to run because they include other difficult businesses, like restaurants, and require long hours. It was not too long ago that the property was abandoned and bringing no business to the town. The zip line would bring people into the park, and hopefully they would stay for the older rides.
 A zip line would be better than bringing in bumper boats, and would allow a view of the whole of Hanover, he said.
 Two neighbors on Cricket's Run spoke at the hearing to raise their concerns about the possible project, as well as the variance required.
 Rolf Manser said he is concerned about noise from the ride, the additional traffic on Route 53 and the need for more parking.

 "Further, I'm concerned about the location of that tower," he said.
 Too many trees may need to be cut down to build the tower, lessening the buffer between the park and the residents, Manser said.
 JP Wing, who also lives on Cricket's Run, said he is worried about the amount of noise the project will produce.
 Zoning member David Connoly said he did not have enough information in front of him, especially compared to the planning board, which has already heard the proposal multiple times. He suggested the hearing be continued until the planning board and the zoning board could gather for a joint meeting on the proposals in front of both boards. Currently, the only issue in front of the zoning board is the 100-foot variance for the tower.
 The next zoning board meeting for the project is tentatively set for Nov. 23, likely in conjunction with the planning board. Before then, the zoning board will also hold a site visit to view the area and see which trees would be taken down, in addition to flying a drone to indicate the proposed height.
 The project is currently set for the planning board's Nov. 9 hearing.

Capt. Mullerwas born in Colombo and educated at St. Joseph’s College. He learnt to fly as a teenager and obtained an ‘A’ licence at Ratmalana. They say that Muller used to cycle from Colombo to Ratmalana Airport to take his flying lessons from renowned flying instructor, Flight Lieutenant Robert Duncanson. Subsequently, Elmo Muller was one of the first 15 Ceylonese to join the Royal Air Force and leave for training to the UK. Four of the 15 were selected as fighter pilots and Elmo Muller trained to fly heavier bombers. He also flew reconnaissance Spitfires attached to Squadron 543 of the RAF. Having entered the RAF as a Sergeant Pilot he rose to the rank of Flight Lieutenant by 1945, when he was just 24 years of age. His quick rise through the ranks say much about Muller as an officer and a pilot.

Archaeologists have also found evidence that these upland villages eventually adopted a Cahokian building method that placed a prefabricated wall directly into a trench. But it didn't happen immediately. They stuck with placing single posts into the ground to create building walls for houses from 1050 to 1350, emphasizing villagers' choice to maintain some of their pre-Cahokian traditional practices in the face of social change.

Ben Franklin might just as well have been talking directly to today’s farmers when he famously said, “In this world, nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes.”
 Even though most will admit continually reducing tax liability each year through deferral is a short-term solution to a long-term problem, few farmers are willing to part with the cash flow and opt to defer the tax liability anyway.
 The problem with this deferral strategy is the fact that someday, we may have to “pay the piper.”

The Desert Locusts invasion that has impacted countries in the greater Horn of Africa (HoA) for the last 2 years continues to devastate communities and livelihoods across the region. As of October 2020, more locust swarms[1] are forming in Ethiopia with a new generation of eggs having been laid in the Eastern part of the country and Central Somalia, with the potential to expand and spread further due to continued breeding in the Red Sea coastal plains and swarm migrating from Yemen[2]. As the winds over the Horn of Africa shift direction and start blowing southwards during November, there is an increasing threat of these swarms reaching northern Kenya before the end of the year[3].

Food insecurity has always been an issue in Southern California, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for assistance is greater than ever. The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank reports that distribution is up by 145% since March and that 115 million pounds of food, the equivalent of 95 million meals, have been provided.
 In more than 30 years of working in the food banking and pantry business, Michael Flood, chief executive of the Regional Food Bank, said he has never seen anything like it. “Not even close,” he said. “I know it’s used over and over again, but [the need] is truly unprecedented.”
 The approaching holidays compound the crisis. “We are also moving into a time when people are used to doing something special in terms of getting together and having whatever their food traditions are,” said Flood, “so we have truckloads of turkeys purchased, full tractor trailer loads. The volume here is significant. Will it be enough? No. There’s more need than that, but will it help? Yeah, it will definitely help.”

NEW YORK) -- As temperatures drop across the country, many are still trying to squeeze as much time as they can outdoors during the coronavirus pandemic by purchasing fire pits for their backyards.      At stores like Home Depot and Lowes, there's been a surge in sales for fire pits and other outdoor items. True Value also says it's also seen a 300% increase in wood-burning fire pit sales.      But while many are flocking to stores to purchase a fire pit of their own this fall season, fire and health departments across the country have posted safety alerts after seeing a rise in fire pit-related injuries.      "These devices are generally low, below the level of the knee," said Dr. Michael Marano, the director of the burn center at St. Barnabas hospital in Livingston, New Jersey. "It's very easy to trip and fall into them."      Not only can people easily trip and fall into these fire pits, but fire pits can also explode if there's no proper ventilation.      That's what happened to Keith Faver and his daughter, Chloe, last winter, when they were enjoying the gas fire pit outside their Florida home. Because the fire pit didn't have ventilation, it exploded and ended up tossing both of them in the air and scattering debris across their yard.      "I turned to find her and she had flown 12 feet in the air over the top of me," Faver recalls from that incident.
