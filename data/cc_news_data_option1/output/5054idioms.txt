Zhang Jienalin will make history this week when she becomes the first female golfer to compete in the 26-year history of the Volvo China Open.
 The tournament in Shenzhen usually has European Tour status and is for men only but the coronavirus and consequent travel restrictions sees it tweaked this year into a domestic event.
 The 24-year-old Zhang, who is ranked 484th in the world, won her first title in the recent mixed-field Hangzhou International Championships.
 On that occasion women were competing from forward tees, but in southern China she will tee it up on the same length course as her male rivals.
 "For me this week it's all about driving distance. I failed to hit the green in two shots on many of the par fours in practice today," Zhang said in a Wednesday press release.
 "The greens here are also very difficult and are playing quite fast.
 "My main aim is obviously to make the cut."
 Unlike previous tournaments, this year's Open is being sanctioned as a China Tour event.
 It has a total purse of two million yuan ($300,000).

One of Singapore's "cruises to nowhere" came to an abrupt end on Wednesday after a passenger tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, spokespeople for the Royal Caribbean cruise line and the Singapore Tourism Board confirmed to Insider.
 Royal Caribbean's Quantum of the Seas vessel, which left Singapore on December 7, returned to port at the island city-state at about 8 a.m. local time on Wednesday, a day before it was scheduled to return from its four-day voyage, Kyunghee Park first reported for Bloomberg. As of Wednesday afternoon, 1,680 passengers and 1,148 crew members were isolated on board while officials conduct contact tracing, Annie Chang, director of cruise at the Singapore Tourism Board, said in a statement to Insider.
 The guest who tested positive was an 83-year-old man who had taken a mandatory COVID-19 PCR test before boarding the ship and had tested negative, Chang said in the statement.
 After reporting to the onboard medical center with diarrhea, the passenger took another PCR test, which came back positive, Chang said. Every guest and crew member who came into contact with the passenger was isolated and has since tested negative for the virus, she added.

 # Relief funds going to municipalities, fire districts
 Messenger Post Media
 Monroe County Post
 Monroe County will provide local municipalities and fire districts with more than $9 million in funding through the federal coronavirus relief bill to help with COVID-19-related expenses.
 “As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only had a devastating impact on our public health, but has also increased the need for vital local government services,” Monroe County Executive Adam Bello said. “I am hopeful that this additional funding for our partner governments will help mitigate their unexpected costs and buffer any impact on their budgets. The financial weight of this pandemic should not fall on our local residents and taxpayers.”
 Nearly $5.4 million will go to towns and villages, $3.4 million to the city and about $90,000 to fire districts. The funds will be used to offset public safety, public health, human services and other costs incurred while responding to the COVID-19 public health emergency.

Innovation and the state’s support of investment in business and education will pay dividends as the economy recovers after it emerges from the COVID-19 outbreak, he said.
 Deriso began his presentation with a history of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, leading up to his explanation of what is happening nowadays and the future outlook.
 The initiative to create a state chamber began in 1911 when officials drove throughout Georgia to promote interest. Four years later, a manufacturers alliance joined the effort to create the state’s chamber of commerce.
 “This was quite an effort to getting the Georgia chamber started,” he said.
 The organization has been an advocate of businesses across the state, mostly with the support of elected officials. The chamber helped promote the sale of bonds during World War II, created the Red Carpet Tour to showcase areas across the state to potential employers, supported tort reform and opened an office in Tifton to help promote the creation of new businesses in rural areas of the state.
 While elected and chamber officials are often in agreement, that’s not always the case, he said.
 “We operate independently of government,” he said. “There are times we are on their side, and sometimes we’re not.”

When Ajit Mohan took charge as the Managing Director of Facebook in 2018, the social media giant was reeling under a crisis. It had been headless for nearly a year after Umang Bedi quit in October 2017 after a short 15-month stint. Bedi had taken over from Kirthiga Reddy, at a time when Facebook was embroiled in a controversy around its Free Basic initiative.
 Nearly two years later, Facebook is facing plenty of backlash over its policies on hate speech and content moderation. It has landed the company at the centre of India’s heated domestic politics. But despite these challenges, Mohan says he is trying to make Facebook’s operations in India stronger than ever before. “There is an absolute conviction that it is not in our economic interest to have hate speech on our platform. We don’t like it from our values point of view. Governments around the world don’t like it. Advertisers don’t like it. Whichever way we look at it, we are clear that we profit from the absence of hate speech,” Mohan told _BusinessLine_ in a recent interview.
 Facebook’s strategy for India rests on five pillars. One, push Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram as the top platforms to enable users to connect and explore. Mohan terms it as “enabling the agenda of expression”. In 2019, there were 328 million people on Facebook and 400 million on WhatsApp and the numbers are going up.
 Two, to engage new entrepreneurs with a focus on small businesses. “Small businesses account for a big share of GDP and a larger share of job creation. It is clear that innovation and economic growth will be fuelled by entrepreneurship. We want to make sure we can play a role in fuelling that agenda,” says Mohan. Facebook has announced a grant of ₹32 crore for more than 3,000 small businesses across Delhi, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore.
 The third priority area is payments. WhatsApp has gone live with its UPI payments offering from November. Payments are available now in ten Indian regional language versions of WhatsApp. “WhatsApp pay will fuel the adoption of UPI even more resoundingly and it can be the platform for meeting financial inclusion goals,” says Mohan.
 The fourth is Facebook’s quest to get more Indians online. Facebook has invested in a project called Express Wi-Fi where the company partners with telecom companies, internet service providers, and local entrepreneurs to help expand connectivity in under-served locations. Under this programme, internet access is provided for as little as ₹10 a day to users in remote parts of the country. The service is commercially available through hotspots across Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Mumbai, Mizoram and Meghalaya. “In the last four years, something remarkable has happened as nearly 500 million people came online on the back of high quality and affordable broadband. You now have the possibility of playing a massive role in enabling the transformation of the economy. We believe we have a role to play here over the long term,” says Mohan.
 Betting on India’s digital growth story, Facebook has invested ₹43,574 crore in Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL) wholly-owned subsidiary Jio Platforms. “An investment of this scale shows an extraordinary commitment to India. There is still an opportunity to bring the next 500-600 million online,” says Mohan.
 The fifth prong of Facebook’s India blueprint is to use the country’s huge market as testbed for future products. “It’s a place where we learn and deploy the learnings in other countries around the world. If we can build something and scale it in India, we can scale it to the world,” explains Mohan. The company recently announced India as the test market for Reels on Instagram, a new format for creating and discovering short-form video content similar to TikTok. It is also experimenting with microlending and microinsurance through WhatsApp. Express Wi-Fi, which was first launched in India, is currently live in more than 20 countries.
 At the centre of this strategy is the belief that growth in India’s Internet economy will lead to higher revenues for Facebook in the long term. “We do want to make sure that the economic models we are building are stable and sustainable. We are not applying a short-term transactional lens. The five pillars connect the dots between our platform agenda, our economic models and India’s economy,” says Mohan. “India as country over the next 5-20 years is on a growth trajectory so advertising as a percentage of GDP is all going to go up as well,” he adds.
 One thing that has worked in Mohan’s favour is Facebook’s decision to create a new organisational structure for its India unit two years back. Under this structure, all functional heads report to Mohan instead of the regional heads. The move is in line with Facebook’s plan of delinking its India operations from the Asia-Pacific region. That change enabled more local accountability and faster decision making. This framework exists only for Facebook’s India operations. “This is a recognition that India has a special role to play over the next few years and decades. India has the biggest user base for Facebook and WhatsApp. More than just the numbers, these products, including Instagram, are deeply entrenched in the lives of Indians,” says Mohan.
 But this deep engagement with users is also proving to be a problem for the social media company. “The user data with Facebook is a goldmine for advertisers, political parties and third-party entities. There have been multiple instances where this data has been misused. This is a big worry and wheels could come off Facebook’s grand vision for India if they do not address this quickly,” said an industry expert.
 Facebook is also facing scrutiny for failing to apply its own content moderation rules every time. Mohan defended the company saying that in the last quarter of 2017 Facebook had pulled down 1.5 million pieces of hate speech content and, in the second quarter of 2020, pulled out 22 million pieces. “More than 90 per cent of hate speech are picked by an automated system even before a user reports it. The stark number tells you the extent of how seriously we are taking this. We have invested in systems and human resources to increase our content enforcement capabilities,” says Mohan.

Hong Kong is reimposing a ban on in-restaurant dining after 6 p.m. and closing gyms, beauty parlors and other businesses and public venues as it tries to get a grip on the latest surge of coronavirus infections in the territory. Restaurants may only provide takeout between 6 p.m. and 5 a.m. and while open, must limit numbers of patrons to 50% of capacity. Enforcement of the new measures will begin Thursday and remain in effect for two weeks. Hong Kong has already limited public gatherings to just two people and closed bars and other entertainment venues. Hong Kong on Wednesday reported an additional 100 cases, bringing its two-week total to 1,274. Most are cases of local transmission and the origins of 303 remain unknown, according to the government's Center for Health Protection. Hong Kong has reported a total of 7,075 cases, including 112 deaths. In mainland China, authorities reported an additional four cases detected in the southwestern city of Chengdu, where authorities have locked down some neighborhoods and ordered widespread testing to curb a new outbreak that now totals nine confirmed cases.

In an industry where up-and-coming heroes do multiple photoshoots and release statements every other week to stay in the limelight, Jai is somewhat of an oddity. He rarely gives interviews. He is not too active on social media. Even during the release of his films, you hardly seen him giving promotional interviews.
 “If we cook at home, do we keep saying, ‘ _Super-ah irukku_?’ That’s the job of people who consume it, right? Similarly, for the films I have done, I expect audiences to say what they feel rather than me talking about it,” says Jai, when we pin him down for a Zoom call, “Sometimes, I would be impressed with a storyline but after it is made, I would realise that something has been lost in translation. In such cases, I don’t want to promote it and make myself feel guilty. An average theatre-goer spends more than ₹ 1000 when he goes to a theatre with his family...I do not want to subject him to that.”
 Jai is making an exception with _Triples_ , releasing on OTT platform Disney + Hotstar VIP on December 11. Produced by Karthik Subbaraj’s Stone Bench and directed by Charukesh Sekar, the series will be high on witty one-liners and situational comedy. “I think humour is in-built in me,” he smiles, “Whenever I am doing a scene that involves humour, I know that the audiences will laugh when they watch it...that gives me the confidence to do it better.”
 He believes that _Triples_ will have a lot of such scenes that will have audiences laughing hard. “Even generally, when you are going through a rough time, you perk up if you watch a comedy scene on TV. So, given the troubled times we are in now, a film with humour is more important for audiences rather than horror or a serious subject,” says Jai. But that does not mean it is easy for him, as an actor. “Making someone laugh is tough, because it depends on your body language and dialogue delivery.”
  _Triples,_ the majority of which was shot in Chennai and Goa, will be a tribute to Crazy Mohan’s style of comedy. “My all-time favourite film is one of his... the Kamal Haasan-starrer _Michael Madana Kama Rajan_ ; I watch it every month actually!”

McConville gets it spot on
 Your correspondents’ criticisms of Oisin McConville’s description of life in Gaza makes the usual false arguments. Gaza is under a blockade by Israel and Egypt and unlike the sad analogy of Singapore it doesn’t have an airport (bombed to pieces by Israel) nor a port, and its people cannot leave the strip. More than 2m people live in Gaza with 80% unemployment, limited electricity and almost no drinkable water. This is the result of Israel’s policy of blockade which has lasted for more than fifteen years.

Let’s keep clear heads about this ‘increase’ in the property tax. Will the property tax really increase nine cents?
 I was assigned to the Ways and Means Committee when the law was changed to require the Tax Commissioner to notify the legislature in writing of what the tax rate would need to be for the coming fiscal year. The legislative intent was never to simply take that estimated tax rate and sign it into law. The intent was that the money committees would use the estimate as a starting place and work backwards, doing whatever was needed to come up with an affordable tax rate for all property owners.
 I cannot recall even one year when the property tax ended up being the same as the Commissioner’s estimate.
 This year almost $39 million of the proposed increase is a payment into the Teachers Retirement Fund, up from last year’s payment of $7million. The Retirement Fund is not able to generate enough money needed to pay retiree costs. Why must property tax payers pick up the tab for its mismanagement?
 Gov. Scott said last week that he intends to keep the property tax rate level. It will be a rough winter. And in the end, it is the voters who will decide whether school budgets are approved, not the Tax Commissioner.
 I’ll pass on additional information as it becomes available. In the meantime, do as much good as you can.

India captain Virat Kohli and wicketkeeper-batsman KL Rahul moved up a place each in the latest ICC T20I rankings for batsmen on the back of their consistent run in the recently-concluded three-match T20I series against Australia.
 Rahul, who scored a fifty in the first T20I at Canberra, rose to the No.3 spot eclipsing Australia limited-overs skipper Aaron Finch. Rahul, who was out for a duck on Tuesday, notched up scores of 51 and 30 in the first two T20Is against Australia, playing his part in India's 2-1 series win.
 Kohli, who scored brilliant 85 in the final T20I against Australia at SCG, gained one spot to be at No. 8. Kohli's knock, however, was not enough for an Indian victory as Australia managed to win the dead-rubber by 12 runs.


   
   
 England left-hander Dawid Malan continued to lead the chart in the ICC T20I rankings for batsmen.
 In the bowlers' list, Australia leg-spinner Adam Zampa jumped two places to enter the top 5. Zampa is currently at No.4. England's Chris Jordan also broke into the top 10, while leg-sinner Adil Rashid gained a spot to jump to the third spot behind Afghanistan spin duo Rashid Khan and Mujeeb-Ur-Rahman.

In an industry where up-and-coming heroes do multiple photoshoots and release statements every other week to stay in the limelight, Jai is somewhat of an oddity. He rarely gives interviews. He is not too active on social media. Even during the release of his films, you hardly seen him giving promotional interviews.
 “If we cook at home, do we keep saying, ‘ _Super-ah irukku_?’ That’s the job of people who consume it, right? Similarly, for the films I have done, I expect audiences to say what they feel rather than me talking about it,” says Jai, when we pin him down for a Zoom call, “Sometimes, I would be impressed with a storyline but after it is made, I would realise that something has been lost in translation. In such cases, I don’t want to promote it and make myself feel guilty. An average theatre-goer spends more than ₹ 1000 when he goes to a theatre with his family...I do not want to subject him to that.”
 Jai is making an exception with _Triples_ , releasing on OTT platform Disney + Hotstar VIP on December 11. Produced by Karthik Subbaraj’s Stone Bench and directed by Charukesh Sekar, the series will be high on witty one-liners and situational comedy. “I think humour is in-built in me,” he smiles, “Whenever I am doing a scene that involves humour, I know that the audiences will laugh when they watch it...that gives me the confidence to do it better.”

As theatres took a back seat in the pandemic, it was the OTT platforms that came to the forefront to entertain the audiences.

Whether it was Shakuntala Devi or Ludo, I was grateful that during this time also people could see my movies and may be could distract themselves with whatever is going on in the world right now. As an artiste it is gratifying to entertain people in such circumstances."While she admits that digitally released films are not exactly the usual way to connect with the masses, Malhotra asserts that this is the best option available right now. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sanya Malhotra💥 (@sanyamalhotra_) "Obviously theatrical releases have their own magic but I really like OTT, too. I really like the idea of sitting in the comforts of my home and watching a film with my family. It has its own charm. I am also hoping that with theatres opening, we get back to normal soon. But this is something major that we all need to fight before everything opens up," she points out.The 28-year- old, who was in Delhi with her family the first four months of the pandemic, is getting back in the work mode. While the fate of many films remains uncertain as to where it ends up releasing, Malhotra is sure of one thing that the big screen will never die out."That charm will stay forever, because going to a theatre is also an experience.

Momentum built especially after the 2008 election, Kennedy said, when the challenges were so numerous that election officials began entertaining alternatives to state procedures, such as processing absentee ballots earlier. These were outlined in a report from the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, which was replaced in 2016 by the Wisconsin Elections Commission.
 The report states “election administrators felt overwhelmed with managing in- person absentee applications and ballot logs before Election Day, while voters complained of long lines at in-person absentee voting sites.” The board proposed allowing absentee voters to place their ballots directly into a tabulator as a solution.
 Confronted with a pandemic, other states opted to change their absentee ballot processes. For example, Maryland previously banned tabulating absentee ballots until a week after the election. But this year, the state allowed workers to sort and tabulate the ballots beginning Oct. 1.
 After reaching out to legislative leaders and the governor in March, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett wondered what could spark action. The Legislature hasn’t cast votes since its April meeting.
 “When you hear the leadership in the Legislature talk about local control, what we’re seeing is the farthest thing in the world from local control, as it pertains to the counting of the ballots in this election,” Barrett said.
 In public hearings on LeMahieu’s bill, presenters discussed details of how the current process could be altered and how municipalities in the state would adapt to different rules. Disagreement over these details, and a general reluctance to amend any aspect of the elections process, has kept legislative change at bay.
 “It's always hard for the Legislature to make changes in a process that got them there,” Kennedy said.
 Yet it’s possible the lessons learned from this election could prompt future legislation — especially as absentee voting will likely remain popular, he said.
 However, he said there is another possible outcome. Lawmakers may impose more restrictions on absentee voting, citing concerns about fraud, such as those laid out in the Trump campaign’s recount petition. Studies show fraud is exceedingly rare in Wisconsin — and around the United States
 “Do we make it easier on the election officials? Or do we make it harder on the voters?” Kennedy said. “That will be the tension that we’re balancing.”

Boise State football coach Bryan Harsin recently urged university leadership to pursue leaving the Mountain West Conference and the school engaged with at least two conferences about the possibility, according to records newly obtained by BoiseDev and the Idaho Press.
 On Sept. 11, Harsin emailed then-athletic director Curt Apsey and university president Marlene Tromp to share his thoughts about a recent Mountain West conference call. At the time the conference had previously voted to postpone the fall football season indefinitely due to COVID-19.
 “That leads into the conference conversation that we need to address again and for as long as it takes to put a plan together to move,” Harsin wrote. “NOW is the time! The longer it takes the longer we stay in the MW. I am 1000% convinced we need to make this move for football and if that means other sports too in the long run it will be what’s best for this University.

As theatres took a back seat in the pandemic, it was the OTT platforms that came to the forefront to entertain the audiences. For Sanya Malhotra, too, the possibility of showcasing her work to her audiences was only made a reality because of the digital platforms.
 The actor, who had two releases- Shakuntala Devi and Ludo, says, "I think as an actor, I am very happy that during the pandemic I got to entertain the audience, and I am just really happy. Whether it was Shakuntala Devi or Ludo, I was grateful that during this time also people could see my movies and may be could distract themselves with whatever is going on in the world right now. As an artiste it is gratifying to entertain people in such circumstances."
 While she admits that digitally released films are not exactly the usual way to connect with the masses, Malhotra asserts that this is the best option available right now.
 "Obviously theatrical releases have their own magic but I really like OTT, too. I really like the idea of sitting in the comforts of my home and watching a film with my family. It has its own charm. I am also hoping that with theatres opening, we get back to normal soon. But this is something major that we all need to fight before everything opens up," she points out.
 The 28-year-old, who was in Delhi with her family the first four months of the pandemic, is getting back in the work mode. While the fate of many films remains uncertain as to where it ends up releasing, Malhotra is sure of one thing that the big screen will never die out.
 "That charm will stay forever, because going to a theatre is also an experience. Planning and getting ready and visiting with friends and family. It is an event. OTT is necessary for right now in these times but bade parde ka charm khatam nai hoga," she concludes.

For all the horror stories we have heard about restaurants struggling to make ends meet in the COVID age, it’s nice to hear a success story every now and then. TacocaT in Margate is just that. But how they got there is a bit of a windy road.
 The concept of TacocaT was born two years ago when owner Mike Talley was working as the manager of Ernest & Son over at The Exchange in Linwood and one of the other businesses in the food court suddenly vacated their space. Talley, a local boy from Brigantine who spent decades as a chef in the casinos, decided it was time to make a move.
 “One of the spots at The Exchange became available, so my wife and I wondered, ‘what could go here?’ and then we thought, ‘tacos!’ and so we started to develop the brand. My daughter came up with the name and I worked on the menu. Within three months we had signed the lease and opened TacocaT,” says Mike Talley who owns the shop with his wife, Randi.

An elderly passenger on board a Royal Caribbean "cruise to nowhere" has been diagnosed with the coronavirus, prompting the voyage to be cut short as the vessel returned to Singapore on Wednesday. The 83-year-old guest on the Quantum of the Seas tested positive for COVID-19 after reporting to the ship's medical center with diarrhea, said Annie Chang, director of cruise at Singapore's Tourism Board. The passenger had tested negative prior to boarding, Chang said. "The passenger was immediately isolated and his initial close contacts were identified and isolated," she said in a statement, adding that the contacts have since tested negative. Singapore recently began a "safe cruising" pilot program allowing cruise ships to make round trips from Singapore with no ports of call in between. Strict safety measures were imposed, including reducing capacity by half and pre-boarding testing of passengers. Royal Caribbean is one of two operators licensed to run such trips.

There is a tendency among all people of a certain age to romanticise the past - the school-of-hard-knocks, never-did-me-any-harm line of thought, where the past is recast as being far better than it was. But one thing I will say for the past is that we didn’t have to endure YouTube. I tell my kids that things were better in my day because we only had two channels and not much on. It’s not that I was a huge fan of Radharc, or Garda Patrol, but that the TV we were fed had some shred of quality control. There was an ethos, and there was accountability. But then you spend half an hour watching YouTube with your children and you realise that actually, maybe things were better back in the bad old days before the internet. There is some excellent work on YouTube, informative and educational, but for the most part, that isn&rsquo;t what my youngest kids watch. They watch the loud American YouTubers who delight in driving sports cars over toys and attacking watermelons with homemade weapons.The older two, being 17 and 12, were still children of regular TV programming - we suffered through thousands of hours of , , , , . I can still recite the entire opening theme tune to , although that is more to do with the fact that it was an absolute bop. But all those shows were made with some sort of ethos — they were about entertainment, but there was some shred of education sprinkled through them. Just as &rsquo;s Magic Door taught me about the industrialised production of biscuits, taught my kids that you can still preach love and peace despite the rest of your kind being wiped out by an asteroid; taught us some basic Spanish and cartography; and taught us fire safety and that his arch nemesis Norman Price was the kids TV equivalent of Kaiser Soze from the .But our younger two, aged seven and five, are living in a different world. They don&rsquo;t watch TV, they watch YouTube, and they watch it on the TV, on Switches, or on my phone if we are out and about. The stuff they watch is really, really bad, and I can see no real value in much of it. But aside from young Americans screaming at the viewer to hit like and subscribe, or the fact that so much of what passes for content aimed at kids is clearly not vetted properly and has innumerable questionable messages, images, or behaviours, it&rsquo;s how my kids watch it.Growing up with one TV and two channels taught us about cooperation, negotiations, bribery. My youngest two never have to compromise as they can watch what they want how they want — sometimes I walk into the room and each will be watching a separate YouTube video on their Switches while the TV will be playing another video. They are consuming vapid culture in a distracted and fragmented way, completely separated from each other. Choice has become a curse. With ye olde TV, we had a set schedule, and lived our lives around it — we would all sit down and watch a film together, because it wasn&rsquo;t just about the people in the room spending a couple of hours together, it was about that sense of other people, out in the world, watching the same channel at the same time. It&rsquo;s the same reason hearing a song you love on the radio is a bigger thrill than playing it yourself at home — to know that others are listening too.Cinema isn&rsquo;t just about the big screen, the booming audio, the overpriced snacks, the sticky floor - it&rsquo;s about connections to others, shared experience. Granted it can also be about wishing death on people who chatter or go on their phones, but it&rsquo;s also about losing yourself with strangers in a form of collective dreaming. There are great things about the internet, but seeing your kids devour a video of someone driving a car into a swimming pool is not one of them. The internet has given us what we wanted - everything our own way. We all get to seek out our own truth, our own facts, our own channels and chambers and bubbles. We&rsquo;re already planning our festive TV — the only days old, is already being probed and scribbled on as we figure out colliding schedules. We have seven channels, three if the weather gets bad, and that is plenty — the six of us can battle to the death over what we watch, but it will be a collective decision. That or it will be a good old fashioned Donnybrook, just like in the good old days.

If Kansas' basketball season is a book -- and each game a chapter -- then Bill Self provided some foreshadowing last week as to what was coming Tuesday.
 It's fascinating to look back now. One could point to a thousand small reasons why KU eventually pulled off a 73-72 home victory over No. 8 Creighton at Allen Fieldhouse, but an important one was this:
 Self vowed to learn from a mistake. Then he did just that.
 So let's rewind a second. KU had trouble closing offensively in Saturday's four-point win over North Dakota State. In particular, Marcus Garrett looked fatigued, getting blocked twice in the final four minutes with little elevation on his jumps.
 "I thought Marcus played very tired, and then of course I play him 36 minutes," Self said then, "so that's not a smart thing to do."

 LONDON (AP) — Car maker Honda has temporarily halted production at its plant in England after shipping delays linked to the COVID-19 pandemic and preparations for Brexit left it with a shortage of parts.
 The company said it was forced to make the decision because “transport- related” delays left it short of parts. The factory relies on a “just in time” delivery system, in which parts arrive as they are needed for assembly and not stored locally, increasing efficiency.
 “The situation is currently being monitored with a view to restart production as soon as possible,” Honda said in a statement.
 The disruption of international trade caused by the pandemic is triggering delays as empty containers clog U.K. ports. Stockpiling ahead of Britain’s final departure from the European Union single market are adding to the congestion.
 U.K. Major Ports Group, which represents the nation’s container ports, said a recent survey showed the situation was improving, though ports remained “very busy.”
 “But just as container congestion didn’t occur overnight there are no instant, magic wand solutions,” CEO Tim Morris said in a statement. “Ports and their supply chain partners will need to continue to work constructively together.”

"It's important that you know that you are safe on board and we have a good plan in place to maintain your health, safety, and comfort," the captain said, according to The Straits Times.
 It's unclear how much longer the passengers and crew will have to remain on the ship.
 "They can't really disembark yet because the crew's operator has said that they are performing a review of the contact tracing, ostensibly to make sure they haven't missed anybody else," Gwyneth Teo said on Channel News Asia late Wednesday morning, reporting from the Marina Bay Cruise Center where the ship is docked. "Once that's done, the passengers will be allowed to disembark."
 Royal Caribbean spokesperson Jonathon Fishman confirmed in an email to Insider that guests would be able to leave the ship after the review of contact tracing was completed, but he did not specify when that would be. Chang of the tourism board said that passengers would need to stay on the ship until the Genting Cruise Line's World Dream vessel, which is docked at the same port, finishes boarding its passengers at around 6 p.m. on Wednesday.
