Tight end Colby Parkinson signed his four-year rookie deal with the Seahawks Tuesday, becoming the first of the team's eight 2020 draft picks under contract.
 The signing of draft picks is not real newsworthy anymore since all draft picks get four-year contracts with overall dollar values based on where they were selected and determined by the league's Collective Bargaining Agreement.
 Parkinson was the 133rd overall pick in the fourth round, meaning he will get a contract worth a total of $3.9 million with a signing bonus of $670,440. That means a salary cap number of $777,610 for the 2020 season (draft picks are considered to have a $610,000 cap hit until they sign their deals and their bonuses take affect).
 The Seahawks have a listed $13.9 million in cap room, according to OvertheCap.com, before the signing of Parkinson. The signings of the rookies, which will likely unfold now over the next few weeks and will likely all be done by the time training camp begins, will eat into that number by roughly $3 million or so.
 Parkinson, who played at Stanford, is expected to compete for a spot on the 53-man roster at a loaded tight end position.
 Seattle also signed veteran Greg Olsen to a one-year deal worth up to $6.9 million in February, re-signed veteran Luke Willson to a one-year contract at the veteran minimum benefit number of $1.050 million, and tendered restricted free agent Jacob Hollister to a one-year contract worth $3.2 million.

Several hundred people gathered in downtown Columbia to protest against police brutality in light of the death of George Floyd, starting at 7 p.m. and going well into the night.
   
 What started out as only around 30 protesters, grew to hundreds in a matter of hours.
   
 Early on in the evening, a female was hit by a car while marching through the intersection of Providence and Broadway. Less than an hour later, another individual was hit in the intersection, with each incident ending in both cars driving off and police and emergency services being called to the scene.
   
 "The vehicle aggressively ran through the crowd, knocked her up onto his hood and windshield," said a protester who asked not to be named. "He continued to accelerate through that, throwing her off the side of the car, really hurting her leg."
   
 After the two incidents, protesters attempted to block traffic by placing cones and bricks from the sidewalk on the intersection.
   
 A short while after protesting at the intersection, a much larger crowd gathered at the Columbia police station on Walnut street. Protesters were holding signs, passing around water, blasting music and chanting. Many protesters reminded those around them to stick to peacefully protesting throughout the night, and eventually began their march around downtown Columbia once again.
   
 On North Seventh Street, protesters came across a group of what seemed to be 10 police officers, one of whom had a tear gas canister in hand. Protesters began to move towards the officers, causing them to forcefully request all protesters to back up. After continually asking the officers to kneel with them, two joined the crowd in peacefully kneeling for a few short minutes and were met with cheers and applause from the crowd.
   
 Columbia NAACP chapter president Mary Ratliff urged protesters to back away from the officers, and eventually the crowd dispersed into the streets and returned to the intersection of Broadway and Providence.
   
 Upon returning to the intersection, a small group attempted to loot the Walgreens on Providence, which resulted in many pleas from most protesters asking for a peaceful night.
   
 "We're out here for peaceful reasons only. We are not looting anything, this is not why we are here," a protester told the Tribune.
   
 Still, upon completing a lap around downtown Columbia, the protesters came to find that both of the doors to Walgreens had been broken by concrete rocks, according to an officer at the scene. No looting had occurred, the officer said.
   
 Many protesters shared that they did not condone violence, and clarified why they had gathered on Monday night.
   
 "I know why I'm here, and why I'm here is because I've been dealing with racism [for] all [of] my life." said a protester who went by the name of Demarco.
   
 "[...] Without white people, we cannot get to the place that we want to be. Without Americans, we can't get to the place that we want to be. We all got to know that we are one. Period."

ADDISON -- Courtney Flaws has regularly been called the team mom during her time playing sports at Addison.
   
 As the oldest of seven kids, Flaws has always been looked up to and playing sports was no different whether it was volleyball, basketball or track.
   
 "She is a positive role model for all athletes," said Addison girls track and field coach Katrina Santiago. "She was my captain the last two years, which for an underclassmen is not very heard of.
   
 "We called her the mom of the team."
   
 Flaws excelled in athletics, earning numerous all-state honors in track as well as leading the Panthers in volleyball and basketball.
   
 In addition to her athletic accolades, Flaws earned a 4.1445 GPA. In the summer, she helped with her church's vacation bible school (VBS) while also volunteering with the Red Cross blood drive, the Daily Bread food kitchen and she's done janitor work for her church to name a few.
   
 For her work both on and off the playing field, Flaws has been named Addison's 2020 Scholar-Athlete of the Year.
   
 "I always, always, always put school work first," Flaws said. "If I had a big test or if I had to stay back at school and ask a teacher for help I would always let my coach know and take care of that first. If I had to get to practice late I would stay late after.
   
 "Being in sports all year round, it really made me not take any time for granted."
   
 Unfortunately Flaws and many other student-athletes across the state learned to not take things for granted the hard way this spring when sports were canceled due to the pandemic.
   
 Flaws and the Panthers had high hopes for the track and field season this year.
   
 "That took me a little while to get over," Flaws said. "We had huge, huge goals for this season as a team and individual goals I set for myself."
   
 Flaws is now looking forward to achieving her goals set for her future, starting with attending Spring Arbor University in the fall.
   
 Flaws is looking to go into secondary education with a focus on English and math.
   
 "English is my favorite," Flaws said. "I had a very strong English teacher, Mrs. Brown, she was my teacher in the classroom and kind of a mentor through sports and life. She was always there to listen and really made me want to be a teacher so I can influence other people like she influenced me."
   
 A big draw for Flaws when it came to choosing Spring Arbor was how close it was to home.
   
 Located a little more than a half hour away from Addison, Flaws is looking forward to seeing her siblings grow and play for the Panthers as well.
   
 "They are from seventh grade all the way down to two," Flaws said. "I didn't want go very far away from them because I don't want to miss anything.
   
 "(Spring Arbor) will allow me grow in my faith and stay close to home to watch my siblings grow up."

Making mayonnaise from scratch requires only four pantry staples and takes less time than running to the store for a new jar. Once you’ve got it, the BLTs, tuna salad and egg salad in your days ahead will be better for it.
 While many homemade formulas call for only egg yolk, I prefer to use the whole egg. The final texture is silkier and airier, and the mayonnaise is less likely to break when you make it.
 Like vinaigrettes and salad dressings, mayonnaise is an emulsification of oil and water, which naturally don’t want to mix. The key to preventing mayonnaise from turning into oil-slicked blobs is to add the oil in a very slow, very thin stream as you incorporate it.

BOSTON -- To-go cocktail sales, a cap on third-party delivery service fees and the waiver of penalties and interest for late meals tax payments are core components of a restaurant relief bill that could hit the House floor for a vote on Wednesday.
 Rep. Paul McMurtry, a Dedham Democrat who serves on a restaurant promotion commission established under a 2019 law, said the bill will be "very helpful to a very significant sector" of the state's economy.
 When the COVID-19 pandemic and new public health restrictions forced restaurants to either close for an indeterminate period or dramatically adjust their operations and work within the confines of limited revenues, the commission shifted gears to focus on helping the industry recover.
 "When you look at it, who doesn't want to see a local restaurant succeed and survive?" McMurtry said. "They bring a sense of community, a sense of normalcy, a sense of socialization."
 Restaurants remain limited to takeout and delivery service only under a March order from Gov. Charlie Baker. McMurtry, who co-chairs the Tourism, Arts and Cultural Development, said restaurants have experienced almost $2 billion in lost sales and more than 200,000 employees have been laid off.
 "The major concern at this point, as we navigate these uncertain times, is trying as best as we can to give restaurants and small businesses the tools they need to sustain and survive," he told the News Service. "There's a real, major concern that many may not ever be able to reopen again."
 Some restaurants have already shut their doors permanently or announced plans to do so. Stella Restaurant and Bar, in Boston's South End, closed May 15 after 15 years, writing on Facebook, "Please know that this was not in our control [and] we had hoped to come out of this stronger."
 Restaurants will be able to resume on-site, outdoor dining, with safety precautions, when the state shifts into the next phase of Gov. Charlie Baker's gradual economic reopening plan, and could be authorized to start indoor service later in Phase II.
 Baker on Monday signed an executive order that his administration said would help provide opportunities for outdoor table service by giving local licensing authorities flexibility to approve changes to liquor licenses.
 The bill contains similar language, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Aaron Michlewitz said it would leave the streamlined licensing process in place through November 2020.
 House Speaker Robert DeLeo flagged the issue of liquor licenses in a speech before the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce last month, saying that restaurants were interested in amending existing licenses so that they could serve alcohol outdoors.
 Senate President Karen Spilka also expressed interest in liquor license flexibility in a recent interview. She said restaurants typically need ABCC approval after their local government signs off, which "can sometimes take months," and described facilitating a quicker process as "something that I believe we should do."
 DeLeo also told the Chamber that lawmakers have "heard from many restaurants struggling with the meals tax." The House bill would waive penalty fees and interest for late meals tax payments through the end of the year.
 An April 3 law, also aimed at providing struggling restaurants with additional revenue, allowed establishments holding liquor licenses to sell beer and wine with takeout or delivery food orders. The bill extends that authorization until the end of February 2021, and adds in the ability to sell to-go cocktails with food orders.
 The drinks would need to be in sealed containers and customers would be limited to 64 ounces of mixed drinks per transaction.
 Michlewitz said legislators had considered including cocktails in the original takeout drinks law, and have since watched how other states have handled the idea.
 "We've never done anything like this in the commonwealth, so we wanted to see how the beer and wine sales would go, and maybe what kind of challenges would come from that," he told the News Service. "So far I think it's something that the restaurants have certainly appreciated. It's not the be all and end all, and it hasn't saved the restaurant industry to say the least, but it's certainly something they've been appreciative of."
 The bill would also bar third-party delivery services from charging restaurants a fee per online order that exceeds 15 percent of the order's purchase price. Michlewitz said that measure was based in part on a Rep. Michael Day bill that proposed a 10 percent cap.
 A North End Democrat whose district includes many restaurants, Michlewitz said he's also heard personally of delivery apps that "had been really pushing the limits on how much commission they were charging per order."
 "There had been a noticeable shift from pre-COVID to when the shelter-in-place took effect," Michlewitz said. "There was a real concern of them taking advantage, of especially our small restaurants in particular."
 The House plans to hold a formal session, with remote voting, on Wednesday. Michlewitz said the goal is to take up both the restaurant bill and a bill expanding vote-by-mail options for this fall's elections. House leaders have advised members that they could schedule a second formal session on Thursday if needed.

Preliminary results from mass testing of residents and staff at long-term care facilities in the state have shown that less than 1 percent of them have COVID-19.
 The Department of Health announced mass testing plans days after 20 residents died of COVID-19 and dozens more tested positive at Good Samaritan Society in Sioux Falls following mass testing of residents and employees, including those who were asymptomatic.
 The plan also followed White House recommendations to test all nursing home residents and staff within two weeks.

"SILENT MAJORITY!” Trump tweeted Tuesday, embracing a phrase popularized by President Richard Nixon decades ago, in claiming broad support for his actions. Trump also emphasized the political importance of the moment to his supporters on Twitter and declared that "My Admin has done more for the Black Community than any President since Abraham Lincoln.”
 The District of Columbia's federal status gives the president outsized authority to act, allowing him to direct the deployment of the National Guard. He authorized Attorney General William Barr to oversee a surge in the deployment of federal law enforcement officers, including the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team and agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency.
 Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to distance themselves from Monday night’s events after former military officials criticized their appearance with the president. Senior defense officials told reporters the two were not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said.
 Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible: "I just wish he opened it once in a while.”
 And D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said of the routing of the protesters, "At no time do we think it was appropriate that people who had not violated the curfew or anything else received that treatment."
 Democrats weren't the only ones saying Trump had gone too far.
 "There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others’ property, and no right to throw rocks at police,” said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. "But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I’m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.”
 It was Barr who gave the order Monday afternoon for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump's walk to the church and ahead of Washington's 7 p.m. curfew. Officials said the decision to clear the park was made earlier in the day in response to violence the night before.
 Trump also ordered military aircraft to fly above Washington on Monday night as a "show of force,” according to two Defense Department officials. They said the U.S. military and National Guard were operating under the mission name "Operation Themis.” In Greek mythology, Themis is a titaness of divine law and order, whose symbols are the scales of justice.
 Execution of the order to clear the park created striking split-screen images as officers deployed pepper spray, flash bangs and mounted units to break up the peaceful protest even as Trump was in the Rose Garden saying he supported the rights of peaceful protesters. Chemical remnants still hung in the air as he walked to the church.
 Trump reacted to the clearing of the protesters with enthusiasm, pumping his fist at officers in the park. He'd been furious about weekend images juxtaposing the fires in the area with the darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.
 Trump was also angry about the news coverage revealing that he had been rushed to the White House bunker during weekend protests, believing the park fires in what amounts to his extended front yard made him appear weak.
 But some White House and Justice Department officials privately acknowledged that Monday's events didn't serve the administration well.
 Trump on Tuesday appeared to be backing off his threat to deploy federal troops to quell unrest under the 1807 Insurrection Act. White House officials said Monday night's events indicated that the resources already available to local governments should be able to restore order.
 Instead, Trump turned his Twitter fire on New York officials, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a frequent political sparring partner.
 "New York was lost to the looters, thugs, Radical Left, and all others forms of Lowlife & Scum," Trump tweeted. "The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces.”
 The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump’s message to governors was that if they don’t use all the tools in their arsenal they shouldn’t expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down.
 Trump, meanwhile, toured a Catholic shrine on Tuesday in his second straight religious-themed appearance after he declared himself to be the "president of law and order."
 Washington Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory called it "reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.”
 On Tuesday's drive to the shrine, Trump’s motorcade sped past National Guard members deployed around the World War II Memorial. Some onlookers along the route booed, held "black lives matter” signs or made obscene gestures as the convoy rolled past.

But a development prior to that season catapulted the Eagles into the role of conference favorites. In a decision that is still baffling 40 years later, city rivals Case, Park and Horlick were realigned into separate conferences starting with the 1980 season. That ended their rivalries until 1983, when common sense returned and all three schools were placed into the Suburban Conference.
 Case was moved to the Parkland Conference, which was not known for its excellence in football. Members of that conference included Muskego, Oak Creek and Mukwonago, which would become state powers years later, but that was a long way off in 1980. What’s more, Case had the largest enrollment in that conference in those days, enhancing its role as favorites all the more.

Well, President Trump is determined to show dominance over the protests that are gripping this nation, and the president yesterday enacted a surreal scene outside the White House.
 I was standing, listening to the president deliver his Rose Garden remarks on my cell phone. And I looked up, and there were officers going toward peaceful protesters. And they used some sort of gas, a chemical component, possibly tear gas, that started my eyes tearing up, that started me choking.
 And what I saw was protesters running for -- all over the place, trying to get away from law enforcement that was showing an incredible degree of aggression. The president says that he wants people to understand that they can't just be everywhere that they want to be and that he -- and that people should know that this government is going to be one of law and order.
 The Park Police say protesters were throwing frozen water bottles and other objects at police.
 But I should say, Judy, I did not see that. What I saw were peaceful protesters gathering. And, of course, I learned later that the president did that to clear the streets, so that he could take a walk to St. John's Church.
 Of course, the church -- bishop that oversees that church said that she was outraged that President Trump did that and that he used the church as a photo- op.
 The White House today is saying that it's wrong to call it a photo-op. But, in fact, of course, President Trump did walk to that church to show a Bible and to take pictures and then walk away.
 So, the president here showing that he is willing to move physically law- abiding citizens out of the way in order to take a walk and show the optics to the nation that he wants to show.

"NOVEMBER 3RD," was all it said.
 Trump vowed to deploy the U.S. military to America's own cities to quell a rise of violent protests, including ransacking stores and burning police cars. He offered little recognition of the anger coursing through the country as he demanded a harsher crackdown on the mayhem that has erupted following the death of Floyd.
 Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd's neck with his knee as the man pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, marking a level of unrest unseen for decades.
 The political ground beneath Trump has greatly shifted in the spring of this election year. He was supposed to be running on a strong economy, but now he's facing a pandemic, an economic collapse and civil unrest not seen since the 1960s.
 Indeed, some around the president likened the moment to 1968, when Republican Richard Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate after a summer of riots and captured the White House. But Trump is the incumbent who risks being held responsible for the violence, despite his efforts to portray himself as a political outsider.
 Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, commented Tuesday in Philadelphia on Trump's posing with a Bible. "I just wish he opened it once in a while.," Biden said.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at the Capitol, "We would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many other presidents before him and be the healer in chief, and not a fanner of the flame." She also quoted verses from the Bible.
 Episcopal Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde, whose diocese includes St. John's, also criticized Trump's use of the church.
 "The president just used a Bible and one of the churches of my diocese as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus and everything that our church stands for," she said.
 The church stop and Rose Garden speech followed a video teleconference Trump held on Monday morning with governors, during which he derided them as ineffective in dealing with protests in their cities.
 "Most of you are weak," he said. "It's like a war. And we will end it fast. Be tough."
 "You have to dominate" and "if you don't dominate you're wasting your time," Trump said, demanding the protests be swiftly crushed, even as some warned that such an aggressive law enforcement response could lead to an escalation of violence.
 He urged governors to make more use of the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and other cities.

 Ten of the people who died were residents of Hillsborough County, all age 60 or older -- six women and four men. The other death was a woman residing in Rockingham County, also 60 or older.
   
 DHHS also announced 65 new positive test results for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. There have now been 4,749 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in New Hampshire. Several cases are still under investigation.
   
 Of those with complete information, there are six people under the age of 18 and the rest are adults with 57% women and 43% men. The new cases reside in Hillsborough County other than Manchester and Nashua (11), Rockingham (7), Merrimack (6), Belknap (3), and Strafford (2) counties, and in the cities of Manchester (24) and Nashua (8). The county of residence is being determined for four new cases.

Feeling the effects of COVID-19 closures, Fairfield Glade Community Club finances have been impacted, resulting in reducing and postponing capital expenditures.
 The actions taken by the board last month to reduce operating costs have included canceling FG’s 2020 road paving project and de-silting project – projects worth about $715,000.
 The board assured they came to this decision after having first conducted a study of paving project areas and found no immediate safety issues.
 Director of Finance Denise Dickinson gave a financial update at the Board meeting held May 28 at the Community and Conference Center and said, “We’ve had a little bit of a loss due to COVID-19. Our revenue is down.”
 She reported that the amenities cash flow was negative $1.38 million, which was a negative variance to the budget of about $359,000, including a subsidy of $1 million to golf negative $318,000 to budget, a $262,000 subsidy to food and beverage at $73,000 negative to budget and a subsidy of $163,000 to CCC and recreation which was positive $39,000 to budget.
 General Manager Bob Weber reported year-to-date golf rounds were at about 6,300, down 17,800 rounds less than budget and 17,600 rounds less than the same time last year.
 “We closed all amenities on March 21, so we had no activity for the month of April which is usually a pretty good month,” Weber said.
 Dickinson reported FGCC cash flow was negative $1.2 million through April, including capital income, capital expenditures and debt service. Operating activities were negative $753,000, a negative variance to the budget of “only $88,000” which she said was good given the COVID-19 shutdown.
 POA $627,000 positive result with a $271,000 positive variance. Capital income is positive $1 million.
 Dickinson mentioned 73% of FGCC’s cash was now FDIC insured.
 New to the agenda, the Board has requested Board Treasurer Bruce Cox to also present his perspective on club finances to the board through the end of the year considering the financial impact of COVID-19.
 Cox reported that the Sewer Department continues to operate normally.
 “We started the year with $2.2 million in cash and ended April with $2.6 million in cash. The results for the first four months are pretty much as expected and we don’t see any issues going forward with sewer,” Cox said.
 He noted that POA operations were more of a challenge because the amenities and timeshares were closed from March 21 through April 30.
 “We began the year with $1.9 million in POA operating funds. At the end of February, we had $2.6 million and at the end of March, we had $2.7 million. We projected would end April with $2.3 million and we actually ended April with $2.15 million, so we were pretty close to our projections there.”
 To control labor expenses, FGCC furloughed employees.
 “All POA departments were positive to budget in wages which would be expected with the layoffs. Senior managers limited the hours of our active employees to only what was required to maintain our facilities while we were shut down,” Cox said.
 Phase one of FGCC’s reopening strategy was implemented on May 1. As facilities and amenities are being reopened, some full-time, part-time and seasonal employees have been called back to work.
 As of now, 71 regular employees are still on furlough and 27 seasonal employees have not been called to return.
 “Overall operations since May 1 are going quite well,” Weber said. “We’re pleased with that, pleased to be back in business.”
 Cox added that the club was aware of the fact that amenity revenues will be less than budgeted and would continue to reduce POA operating expenses.

Evelyn Parziale is a spitfire. She has lived an adventurous life. Above all else, her story has taught her that if she’s not having fun, she’s wasting her time.
 “I’ve been around. We have lived everywhere. I have met generals, and I’ve seen emperors. I’ve had a very interesting life,” she said. “I’m still here. I’ll be 99 in July. When you reach my age, you can say anything you want and get away with it.”
 The feisty 98-year-old and her husband moved to Fairfield Glade in 1983. In those 37 years, she has been very heavily involved in the community, volunteering at various non-profits, as well as volunteering and serving as head librarian of the Fairfield Glade Library for over 30 years. She retired as head librarian in October 2017. Even then, she continued volunteer at the library until January 2018.
 Parziale’s story began in Boston, MA, where she was born to Axel “Ted” Theodore and Gladys D’Arcy Johnson in 1921. Ted and Gladys were both white- collar clerical workers.
 As Parziale put it, “We were just a good, old middle-class family. No pretensions. Life was so much simpler back in those days.”
 Parziale attended and graduated from schools in Braintree, MA. She earned her teaching degree from the Bridgewater Teachers College, now Bridgewater State University.
 “I taught school for a year and a half,” Parziale said. Then she added, only half jokingly, “Hated it.”
 She got a job working for American Airlines in the reservations department.
 One evening, she and a friend went to a movie and then stopped in for a drink at a music bar, where she was spotted by Army Capt. Charles “Chuck” Joseph Parziale when she walked in. He approached her with a fellow warrant officer, and said when he saw her walk in, he had already determined that he was going to marry her.
 “That’s the God’s honest truth!” Parziale said. “He was cute.”
 It was 1945, and the war was still on. Parziale said dating and relationships during wartime was different because you could have a couple of dates with someone and then they were just gone – they never came back from war.
 With this in mind, she said, “He wanted to marry me, so I kept him.”
 They had a wartime marriage within six weeks of their initial meeting.
 “I mean it was crazy, crazy, crazy. When we told our parents, they were appalled,” she said, laughing unapologetically. “But, it worked.”
 Chuck was a decorated Army captain who’d been wounded during the breakthrough at Anzio in the Italian theater and had just spent an extended amount of time in the hospital recuperating. He’d been awarded accolades, including the Silver Star and Bronze Star. He continued his service, climbing the ranks and became a colonel.
 After being stationed in Texas and Georgia, they were transferred to serve overseas. Their first overseas assignment was in Japan during the occupation. Two of the five Parziale children were born there. Then, while the wives stayed behind in Japan, the men received orders and were shipped out to Korea.
 They returned stateside for a while before they were assigned to Germany for about three years. Their last overseas assignment was in Thailand. The last seven or so years of Chuck’s military career had them living in Springfield, IL, where he was the Senior Army adviser to the Illinois National Guard.
 “How’s that for a title?” she said, obviously very proud of her husband.
 Parziale said as their children grew up moving from post to post, they didn’t have roots.
 “They all graduated from the same high school in Illinois, but no old homestead. We were on the move all the time,” she said.
 Chuck retired from service in 1970, and, with their children all grown, the couple moved to Florida.
 They lived there for about eight years and were ready to find a new home. On their way up heading for the East Coast and looking for their new home, they stopped in Cookeville to visit some friends who had been posted in Thailand with them.
 Their friends asked them, “Why not look at Fairfield Glade?”
 “So, we did,” she said. “The rest is history.”
 History — or better known as a life well lived.
 Parziale said she remembered there was hardly anything on the other side of Peavine Rd. when they decided to move to FG. “It has grown considerably,” she said. “Now that side has been built up.”
 Chuck passed away just over a year after the move to Fairfield Glade. Parziale immediately started volunteering her time and efforts toward the betterment of the community. She volunteered with The Arc thrift store, then with Habitat for Humanity serving on committees and as chairperson, then with Good Samaritans Thrift Store.
 Then, of course, she volunteered at the FG Library. When the library was first organized, it was located in a single room in Westminster Church.
 “It had been a station of the book mobile. When that was discontinued, we did what was necessary to make our own library,” Parziale said.
 As it grew, she said the library moved to the new mall next door before it was given its own designated place in the FG Library/Multi-Purpose Building on Lakeshore Dr.
 Some of her favorite memories in her nearly 40 years of living in FG revolved around her friends. She was a member of the XYZ (X-tra Years of Zest) singles group with about 20 members, and she really enjoyed the friendships she established with those residents. She also remembered what used to be called the “Welcome Wagon” that is now Neighbors and Newcomers group.
 In the past couple of years, she has limited her volunteer activities but continues to volunteer at Good Samaritan Thrift Store in Crossville, where she has been volunteering for well over 20 years.
 In a life spanning nearly a century and nearly 40 years in Fairfield Glade, she knows a good thing when she sees it. She misses her dear friends who have passed on.
 She said, “You know, if you didn’t laugh you’d cry.”
 The five Parziale children blessed her with 11 grandchildren and four great- grandchildren who live all over the U.S. Off the top of her head, she said some live in Illinois, Virginia, Florida, Ohio and Georgia.
 “I lose track,” she joked. “There’s too many of them.”
 However, she has risen to her newest title of “G.G.,” short for great- grandmother. It is the beloved name her great-grandchildren call her and she loves it.
 “I have a driver’s license that’s good until I’m 103,” she said, laughing. “So watch out for me on the road.”

But Veit never treated Kuiper as a star, anymore than anyone else on the Eagles. He saw him as just another player on a team that stressed unity and a one-for-all, all-for-one mindset. Even though Case came within one victory of playing for a state championship that season, the teamwork perspective is what mattered most to Veit, not so much what remains the best record in the program’s history.

"Zimbabwe will, therefore, continue on the Level 2 lockdown for an indefinite period. We shall have regular two-week interval reviews to assess progress or lack of it. This should give us more time to strengthen the prevention and case management approaches for the various risk populations," he said.

What should you do if you are sprayed?
 "The most important thing to remember is not to rub your eyes if you get sprayed. This will spread the compound deeper into your eye," Dr. Glatter has explained to Men's Health.
 Use clean hands to carefully remove contact lenses if you wear them. Blink so you help your tears wash away the oily pepper spray.
 "Applying baby shampoo to the affected eye is the most effective for neutralizing and removing the oil resin contained in pepper spray," he says. Then irrigate your eyes. Ideally, use sterile saline, but it's unlikely that you'll have that with you, so use water. "Often several liters is necessary to adequately irrigate the eye after exposure. A 20-ounce bottle of water poured over your eye is just not enough," he adds.
 If you get pepper spray in your mouth, rinse that with huge amounts of water, too. "Sucking on ice chips may also help to alleviate burning on your lips, tongue, gums and roof of your mouth," Dr. Glatter says. "While rinsing with milk may reduce pain in your mouth, it will not remove the oils present that are causing the pain."
 Wash yourself as soon as you are able, and wash your clothes, too (separately from other clothes). Over one to two hours, the pain should gradually dissipate. Seek medical attention if you think the spray has caused burns to your eyes or skin, or if you're having trouble breathing.

Like all "Final Fantasy" games, the plot here is ludicrous. But the appeal of this game for me has always been as a sort of road trip simulator. You roll around the country with your bros, stopping every once in a while to get gas, kill some monsters, go camping, or climb to the top of a volcano to take down a giant bird so you can take its giant eggs and eat them with cup noodles. It's nice.

The status that she strives to hold onto is also seen in the clothing Betty wears, which went from plain Jane when she was first married to Dan, to designer outfits and expensive jewelry as her husband became more successful. And throughout the divorce, that clothing transforms into armor, protecting that facade she has created for herself. “She was armoring herself for a long time. Like, ‘This is my wife. I’m not letting go of it,” Cunningham says. “The clothes and the hair were a big part of that.”

“Finally, this bill includes a problematic income tax exemption for for-profit banks. While the efforts of Kansas banks and credit unions to reach a compromise on this legislation are laudable, I cannot in good conscience agree to providing tax breaks for banks in light of the looming budget shortfall. Additionally, the CARES Act already provides relief for banks that will far exceed the benefits of this legislation.
