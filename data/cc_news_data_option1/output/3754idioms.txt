On a recent sultry mid-September Sunday with rain showers all around us -- and probably a few rainbows too -- there's hardly a better person to spend a few hours with than Lynda Beam. We convened in her commodious Vernonburg porch, some eight miles from downtown Savannah, to talk about Andrew Jackson, a faithful friend who was humble, gentle and accommodating.


   


  Andy, who died a few weeks ago, was a Sicilian donkey. He was 28 years old, kin to the herd started by Ossabaw's Sandy West when the doyenne, now 107 years old, bought a couple of donkeys for her son Justin, then 10 years old. In the 1980s, when state officials decided to rid the island of the donkeys, Lynda stepped in. She'd visited Ossabaw often as a child, usually with her parents who were friendly with Sandy. "I'll take a couple," she said. She wanted to keep the Ossabaw line pure.


   


  Andy's mother was Sandy Eleanor.


            


  "When Sandy heard what I named him, she said, 'I don't believe anyone's ever been named after me.'"


   


  Thirty years ago, Sandy Eleanor was full grown -- "and not showing," said Lynda -- when the late Roger Parker, who used to work on Ossabaw, casually tied a "crocker" sack around her neck and held on as he navigated his boat to the mainland. On the way to Lynda's, Sandy Eleanor sat in the back of a pick- up truck "as calm as can be. You'll never find a donkey leading a charge into war. I think it was Sandy who said that.


   


  "The first seven babies were boys," said Lindy Beam Wheat. Lindy and her husband Joseph had just stopped in to say hello. They live down the street, as does Lynda's brother and son. Lynda was six weeks old when her parents moved to Vernonburg.


   


  Lindy is vice president of Guerry Lumber ("Everything to build anything"), a company on Barnard Street Lynda's grandfather started in 1927.


   


  "Mama really wanted to breed the donkeys," Lindy said.


   


  Ready to talk donkeys, Lynda reached into a file and presented a certificate of registration from the Miniature Donkey Registry of the United States for Andy's registration papers. But then she disappeared into her house for a few minutes.


   


  "Oops. I forgot to wear a brooch," Lynda said returning with a modern silver variation of a piece of jewelry that is a bit of a throw-back to another era when women - and men - wore them. Lynda is rarely seen without one. We talk about starting a Bring Back the Brooch club.


   


  Brooch securely pinned, we headed out to the pasture to see Andy's grandchildren in a field where Lynda, 79, hopes to build a home for herself when she gets older. "One room," she said. "One long room."


   


  Either that or what they do in The Netherlands, Lynda said earlier. "You know, when they match up graduate students who need a place to live with people in 'finishing schools' - that's what I like to call assisted living places - who need help. Seems like a win-win situation."


   


  Then we spotted Andy's grands lumbering toward us in no particular hurry.


   


  "Hey girls," Lynda yelled. "They might be pregnant. Can you tell? I keep looking for milk sacks. We might be blessed. Here's Peggy Sue and Daisy. Put your ears up for the camera."


   


  They obliged.


   


  "Oh, look," Lynda said bending down to look closer at a passion flower. "A zebra longwing. Are you into butterflies?"


   


  Before I could answer, another visitor to the house -- Laure Ike, who had come to tend the horses -- started complaining about an armadillo who had taken residence at her property. Lynda had just what Laura needed -- an armadillo trap.


   


  "You set it up like a rabbit gum," she said, using a term both women seemed to be familiar with.


   


  But mostly Lynda wanted to talk about Savannah's participation in the International City of Peace, created by a United Nations resolution in the 1980s. She and three friends were sitting around one day bemoaning the violence and dissension in the city. They suggested Savannah's participation to then-mayor Eddie Deloach and he went for it. This year's celebration is Monday.


   


  "We need peace," Lynda said. "I'd like to see a large banner in front of City Hall. Wouldn't that be grand?"


   


  It would be. I hope they hang one.

FREDERICKSBURG, Va. — When Ellie Dufilho, 15, starts driving next year, it will be behind the wheel of her own custom-built vehicle.


  Not only that, it will be a complete rebuild of a classic model — the 1965 Ford Falcon—that she and her dad, Matt, did themselves at their Spotsylvania County home.


  The pair created a YouTube channel — Ellie’s Garage — to document their endeavor and it has led to opportunities for Ellie, a home-schooled sophomore, to write articles for vintage car magazines and national auto-parts dealers, and an invitation to be the special guest at the next national meeting of the Falcon Club of America.


  “As an adult woman in the world, she’s going to be able to not only listen to a mechanic and know what they’re talking about, but be able to not have to take her car to a mechanic at all,” said Ellie’s mom, Robin Dufilho. “I love that she’s being empowered and emboldened.”


  Ellie has always been a maker. She loves drawing and baking — figuring out what goes into a cake to make it rise — and she and her dad built a fort in their backyard.


  “I’ve loved teaching myself how to do something on my own since I was real little,” Ellie said.


  She’s also always loved old cars from the ’50s and ’60s, with their giant chrome fenders and circular tail lights.


  When Ellie was about 10 years old and riding in the car with her dad, she noticed a 1960s Ford Falcon parked in a driveway.


  “She said, ‘Oh dad, look at that,’ and we pulled over to stare at it,” Matt Dufilho said.


  As Ellie examined the Falcon that day, she thought, “Wouldn’t it be fun to build one of these?”


  “It became sort of a dream conversation,” Dufilho said. “Just fun talks. When we saw old cars, we’d stop and talk about them.”


  But as Ellie got closer to being old enough to drive, Matt and Robin presented her with an option. They would buy her a vintage car to restore, and she would pay for all the work and new parts that would need to go into it.


  Ellie accepted the deal. The family researched vintage cars and settled on the Falcon.


  “It’s about as good a starter car as you can get,” Matt Dufilho said. It was just a happy coincidence that the car that caught Ellie’s eye as a ten-year- old was also a Falcon.


  They bought their Falcon on Ebay, sight unseen, for about $2,000 and flew to Skokie, Ill., in November to pick it up.


  The car was in good enough shape that Matt and Ellie could drive it the 750 miles home.


  During that drive, Ellie learned about all the things that have changed in vehicle design in the past 55 years. She had never used a hand crank to open and close a window, or seen lap belts in the front seat instead of three-point seat belts.


  “Ellie had all these realizations about things, like she looked at the odometer and said, ‘Oh, it’s actually rolling,’” Matt Dufilho said.


  Once home, Matt and Ellie started rebuilding the car from the ground up.


  “We are basically going through the car step by step and redoing everything,” Ellie said. “The first thing we started with was the engine. We have completely overhauled the engine and the transmission. We have cleaned out the engine bay and put in all new wiring. We are just basically making it a brand new car.”


  While Ellie and her dad are focused on the drive-ability of the car, Robin is safety monitor.


  “This is our infant that we’re letting drive around in a 55-year-old car,” Robin Dufilho said. “I’m the one going, ‘Three-point seat belts would be a great addition. And how about a third brake light? Wouldn’t that be a fun project to install?’”


  Matt Dufilho said adding safety to a vintage look has been “a challenge, but a fun challenge.”


  The one thing they won’t be able to do that Robin keeps asking about is install air bags.


  Matt Dufilho said he always wanted to restore a car.


  “When we were first married and dirt poor, Robin’s dad taught me how to change oil. I like learning that kind of stuff,” he said. “I started changing our own oil and over the years, I started doing all the car maintenance as well.”


  While he said he is the one who does the research and brings the knowledge to the restoration process, it is a true team effort.


  “I’m much more of a creative person and Ellie is much more like her mom, very logical, very smart,” he said. “If you watch the videos, it’s not dad doing the work while Ellie’s holding something. She actually makes really great observations and comes up with ideas of how to do things.”


  Ellie estimates that she’s put about $2,500 into the car so far—money that she’s saved from birthdays and Christmases and earned by dog-sitting and other odd jobs.


  Companies learning about Ellie’s project have come on board to help. Hughes, an Arizona-based company, offered to overhaul the Falcon’s transmission for her.


  The family also started a Patreon fundraising account for the project.


  Having taken care of the Falcon’s engine and wiring, Ellie and her dad have moved on to the body of the car. Most recently, they fashioned a new toeboard out of 16 gauge steel and took apart and repainted the dashboard.


  Last, they’ll turn their attention to the interior. They plan to install bucket seats with head rests in place of the original low-backed bench seats.


  Finally, they’ll paint the custom Falcon in a “dream color” that Ellie is keeping secret until they reveal it on the YouTube channel.


  Ellie said she and her dad are already talking about what car project they’ll take on next.


  “Mom always wanted an old Mustang,” she said.


  “I want it to be electric,” Robin Dufilho said. “I figure they can figure that out!”


  Ellie doesn’t plan to become a mechanic. She wants to go to college to study either English or engineering. But she’s glad to have all this automotive knowledge.


  “I didn’t know anything about cars,” she said. “It’s not like I came into this having all this knowledge. I’ve learned so many things about how the car works and what the components are. And how to weld!”

"None of us knows what we are capable of until we are tested," once said Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, as she reflected on her long career. To be the first in a male-dominated field in a time when women had few rights led her to be tested many times. Because of her determination, Blackwell became the first woman physician in the United States, paving the way for others to follow.


   


  Elizabeth Blackwell was born in England in 1821. She was the third of nine children born to Samuel Blackwell, a sugar refiner and lay preacher, and his wife. Her father made sure that all of his children had the best education possible through the private tutors he hired, including for his daughters, which was very unusual at the time.


   


  Disaster struck in 1832 as a fire destroyed the sugar refinery. The family was nearly ruined financially, and they left for New York to start over. Shortly afterward, the family settled in Ohio. Their father died in 1838, leaving the family with many debts and little money. To help bring in money, Elizabeth Blackwell and two of her sisters started a school in Cincinnati.


   


  Blackwell would end up taking teaching positions with her older sisters in Kentucky and North Carolina before returning to Ohio. After caring for a friend through a difficult illness, Blackwell developed an interest in studying medicine. However, because she was a woman, every school she applied to turned her down.


   


  Finally, she applied to Geneva Medical College in New York. Though she clearly met the academic standards and could afford the tuition, college officials were concerned about admitting a woman. In an unprecedented move, the matter was discussed with the students and a vote was taken on whether to admit Blackwell. The students decided to admit her, and in 1847 at the age of 26, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first American woman to attend medical school. She still faced many obstacles because of being a woman. She noted years later, "The idea of winning a doctor's degree gradually assumed the aspect of a great moral struggle, and the moral fight possessed immense attraction for me." She graduated in 1849 as the first woman doctor in the nation.


   


  Blackwell soon published a paper in the Buffalo Medical Journal in New York on the spread and treatment of the deadly typhoid fever. This was also the first medical article written by a woman published in the United States. After expanding on her medical studies in Europe, she returned to New York City. Here, she opened a small clinic in 1853 that gradually expanded into a charity hospital for the poor.


   


  Her siblings managed to have remarkable lives of their own. Her sister Sarah became a noted biographer. Two brothers, Samuel and Henry, became prominent abolitionists and women's rights activists. Her sister Emily was so inspired by her medical education that she attempted to enroll at Geneva College as well. However, her attempt failed. A college in Illinois expelled her after being threatened with closure. She was finally admitted to what is now Case Western Reserve University in Ohio where she earned her medical degree in 1854, becoming only the third American woman to graduate from medical school.


   


  During the Civil War, Blackwell helped organize nurse training for the Union war effort. With her headstrong and determined nature, she often clashed with officials with the United States Sanitary Commission, leading her to create the Woman's Central Relief Association to continue training nurses to her high standards.


   


  In 1874, Blackwell, along with her sister Emily, Florence Nightingale, and others established the London School of Medicine for Women. This was the first medical school in the world established specifically to train women as physicians. It still operates as part of the prestigious University College London Medical School.


   


  Blackwell retired from the medical school and from medicine in 1877. She spent the next several decades touring across Europe and the United States, giving lectures and writing extensively on all sorts of social and moral reform movements active at the time. Public health and encouraging its instruction in schools became a topic of great interest to her as well as calls for women's suffrage. Eventually, she settled permanently in England. She continued to travel the world on lecture tours well into her eighties.


   


  In 1907, Blackwell was seriously injured in a fall down a flight of stairs while visiting Scotland. She died at her home in England in May 1910 at age 89. Her sister Emily died three months later. Today, there are nearly 370,000 women physicians in the United States, practicing in all fields of medicine. This includes more than 23,000 women in Texas, more than one-third of all doctors active in the state.

I felt incredibly close to Louise, but I had never actually met her. Ours was a working relationship that started just before lockdown and, as a result, we have still not encountered each other face to face. But as I mentioned this to Louise in astonishment and she agreed that this fact did indeed feel very strange, I wondered if – in an age of social media and social distancing – face-to-face contact even really mattered any more.

In origine la B side di _True Blue_ , con un arrangiamento tecnologico di marca mid-Eighties sotto la produzione di Reggie Lucas, era un funkettone bianco semisintetico (ma non troppo) e spruzzato di un sapore alla Nile Rodgers, tanto che ad ascoltarla ora sembra uscita da _Random Access Memory_ dei Daft Punk. La patina di effetti phaser sembra spuntare fuori da un disco di hypnagogic pop del 2009 e rotti. Il recupero attuato da Madonna nell’86 (ma era già b side per il singolo di _Dress You Up_ uscito in Giappone nel 1985) implica che il pezzo meritava parecchio, era infatti stato originariamente pensato come suo primo singolo in assoluto e poi come lato B di _Everybody._ Non divenne né una, né l'altra cosa probabilmente perché era ancora troppo legato alla prima versione wave di Madonna, mentre _Everybody_ era già a tutti gli effetti un inno post disco dall’impetuoso minimalismo. Nessuno ovviamente avrebbe potuto pensare che, al contrario, in futuro sonorità del genere sarebbero diventate hype con personaggi quali Geneva Jacuzzi, che prende in un certo senso il testimone della prima Maddy.

“I was thinking about it from the fifth inning on, and I was actually trying to do the opposite of jinxing it by talking about it,” Grant said. “Isaac put a great swing on that pitch in the ninth inning, and I can’t complain about giving up a hit to him. He’s a great hitter.


  “But I didn’t really feel any nerves in the last couple of innings. I just wanted to stick to the game plan, which was keeping pitches away from the middle of the plate and throwing it in and out and getting weak contact.”


  Zwingle’s biggest threat came in the first inning, when Juan Munoz reached on a hit batsman and Travis Lyons walked. But Grant coaxed Lance Richardson into an inning-ending fly out to left field.


  “We were just missing in that first inning,” Grant said, giving credit to catcher Nolan Weber. “He did a great job of moving (location) in and out, and when we did miss, we didn’t miss right down the middle. That was the big thing.”


  After the first-inning hiccup, Grant retired 21 straight batters until Luke Kuennen reached on a two-out error in the top of the eighth inning. Grant struck out seven, walked one, hit one batter and faced just four batters over the minimum in the nine-inning gem.


  “We were more or less pitching to contact,” Grant said. “That was the biggest thing. When I got down, that’s when I tried putting guys away. For the most part, it was a matter of putting it in spots where they really couldn’t barrel anything up, getting weak contact and getting the out.”


  Grant, who primarily pitches for the Peosta Cubs, put an exclamation point on a dominant season. Last month, the former Dubuque Senior and University of Iowa hurler earned the starting pitcher spot on the postseason Prairie League all-star team.


  “To be honest, I’m kind of glad this is the last game with the way my arm feels,” Grant said. “It was great to go out with a win, and that’s something most teams don’t get to say. But this is a great group of guys and we had a lot of fun.”


  The Reds earned their first tournament title of the summer after a handful of near-misses.


  “We were kind of close all summer, but we couldn’t win one, so it’s really nice to go out on top in the last one of the season,” said right fielder Bryce Simon, who went 2-for-3 with an RBI and two runs scored Saturday. “We won more games than we did last year, but it’s tough when you’re in the bottom half of the bracket of tournaments most of the time. We played pretty well and went deep in most tournaments, so it feels good to get this one, finally.”


  Cascade opened the scoring with a single run in the bottom of the first inning without the benefit of a hit. Brock Simon led off by reaching on a dropped third strike, moved up a base when Bryce Simon walked and scored all the way from second on an errant pickoff attempt.


  The Reds broke the game open two innings later, when they sent 10 batters to the plate and scored four runs on three hits, three walks and an error. Bryce Simon singled in the first run, Nolan Weber and Blake Simon drew bases-loaded walks, and Logan Otting singled through the left side for an RBI single that made it 5-0.


  Cascade added an insurance run in the eighth. Bryce Simon laced a leadoff single and scored on a two-out single by Blake Simon.


  The Reds finished with six hits despite not playing in three weeks. The tournament had been postponed the past two weekends because of weather.


  “You could see a little bit of that rust today,” Cascade manager Mark Simon said. “We knew it would be like that, and we knew Zwingle would throw some good guys at us. We only had four hits to get those first five runs, but, fortunately, we caught some breaks on walks and timely hits. As long as Connor was out there and we played defense, we knew we had a shot.


  “We love playing at Bernard, because it’s one of the best around. It’s always good to win that last game of the season. These guys will go their separate ways for a while, but we should have most of this group back next year.”

This is metapolitics, changing minds, then cultures can be changed in the long run. If more and more people distrust liberal democracies and believe that liberals are satanists planning to implement the New World Order, it’s not possible to uphold democratic accountability.

President Donald Trump has endorsed state Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, in his bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger. The president announced his support via Twitter. “Nick Freitas (@NickForVa) will be an incredible Congressman for the people of Virginia,” Trump tweeted Friday morning. “A Green Beret Combat Veteran, he is Strong on the Military & Vets, the Economy, Healthcare, and the Second Amendment. Nick has my Complete and Total Endorsement! #VA07” “This is huge!,” the Republican legislator’s campaign emailed supporters Friday evening. “President Trump needs Nick in Congress fighting back against the socialist agenda and working for our Commonwealth. Nick will work with President Trump to back our police officers, restore law and order, and stop the far-left mob.” “President Trump needs Nick in Washington to join him in rebuilding our economy, especially in the wake of COVID-19. Together, they will rebuild the greatest economic comeback in history, but that can’t happen without your help,” the campaign added, requesting donations. “Nick needs your urgent support to get to Washington and defend our President.” Eric Cantor, a former House majority leader, endorsed Freita the week before last. Cantor joined with Dave Brat, his former political rival, to back Freitas for the Central Virginia post that the two men once held. The Culpeper legislator is among the GOP candidates being funded by the House Republicans’ campaign arm as a member of its Young Guns program. The Army veteran of two combat tours in Iraq was endorsed the other week by the National Federation of Independent Business, the country’s largest small-business association. Spanberger was endorsed in the first week of September by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The former CIA officer and U.S. postal inspector chairs the House Committee on Agriculture’s Conservation & Forestry Subcommittee and serves on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Tom Bliley, who represented the 7th District for 20 years before Cantor, is a member of Freitas’ finance committee, along with Cantor and Brat. In December, two days after the delegate entered the race, U.S. Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, announced they were backing Freitas. The California native has also been endorsed by the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks, two conservative advocacy groups; and U.S. Rep. Ben Cline; state Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania; and state Dels. Michael Webert, R-Marsha; and Brenda Pogge, R-James City County. Brat endorsed Freitas last spring. Brat was elected to represent Virginia’s 7th District primary in June 2014, shocking the political world by defeating Cantor, the House majority leader. In 2018, Spanberger defeated Brat by a 50 percent to 48 percent margin. Before Spanberger took office, a Republican had represented the 7th District since 1971. The National Republican Congressional Committee began targeting Spanberger in February 2019 because she is among the freshman House members who flipped GOP-held seats in the 2018 midterm elections. Donald Trump won the 7th District in the 2016 general election. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the 7th District race as a “Democratic toss-up.”

The problem is that it is Indians who still believe that the Chinese can be made to mend their way, see reason, as External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar hoped ahead of the Moscow meeting with his counterpart Wang Yi. The outcome of that meeting was a five-point agreement, which incorporated the oft-repeated clichés that have become a part of any India-China dialogue--"differences should not become disputes"; "abide by all the existing agreements and protocol on China-India boundary affairs"; "border troops…should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions". Meaningless words, considering China is consistently guilty of violating each and every of the five points. Worse, the agreement lays a minefield for India for it talks about disengaging and retreating from current positions, which means India vacating all the heights it presently occupies on the bank of Pangong Tso, overlooking PLA's Moldo garrison--which is now a sitting duck--and thus losing the tactical advantage it has. And the 14-15 June clash at Galwan is proof of what disengagement means to the Chinese. This is not the time for hoping that China will see reason.

So, a lot of people agree to move and some people do that voluntarily because they themselves don't want to be out in a workplace situation that exposes them to possible risk. Whilst you have this technical breach possibly occurring, the likelihood is that, from a practical perspective, you're more likely to have the employee saying, let me get on board. Now, when they get on board, the employer should really make some inquiries to ensure that they mitigate the level of risk that may be in the house when they are working."

Cook texted Travis about some cough medicine that she wanted to drop off for one of the children and instructed him to meet her downstairs in the car park.


  Travis went down and waited. It was close to 7pm. But instead of meeting Travis there like arranged, Cook sneaked past him and went up to the apartment. It was unlocked and she walked straight in.


  When Travis realised he’d been lured out, he went back upstairs to find Cook confronting Lisa.


  It was clear Cook had come for a fight and Travis asked her several times to leave. When she refused, he called 911. Cook than locked herself in the bathroom for about 15 seconds, before bursting out.


  Cook reached for her coat as though she was going to leave, but instead, she pulled out a handgun and fired two bullets into Lisa.


  They hit her in the chest and back. Lisa fell back seriously injured onto the sofa – the horror was all unfolding in front of the terrified twins.


  Hysterical, Travis told the police to come fast and tried to help his girlfriend. Cook sat down on a chair as Travis told his children to run to their rooms.


  Then as Cook appeared to reach for her coat again, Travis grabbed her and pinned her against a wall, holding her there until the police arrived.


  Travis told police what had happened, and Lisa was rushed to hospital but, tragically, she couldn’t be saved. Cook had got what she wanted – Lisa permanently out of the picture.

NORTH ABINGTON TWP. — During the pandemic shutdown, the Roba family wasn’t sure their namesake Roba Family Farms would open for the make-or-break fall season.


  So, they planted vegetables at their Lakeland Orchard & Cidery 9 miles away in Scott Twp. to at least have produce to sell.


  “When this (pandemic) all started in March, we sat together as a family and said what can we do if for some reason we can’t open our door,” said family matriarch Sue Roba. “That was our main concern, so that we can continue in business so we can survive.”


  It turned out the state’s green phase of COVID-19 reopenings meant Roba Family Farms at 230 Decker Road in North Abington Twp. — one of the region’s largest and best-known seasonal attractions — could resume after all. It opened this weekend on schedule.


  “Fall — that’s our season. These (next) four to seven weeks right now, that’s our living,” Roba said.


  With picture perfect weather Saturday, large crowds came out to soak in all of the farmy fun.


  Lea Christopher of Kingston and her 4-year-old son, Landon Birk, enjoyed their outing Saturday at Roba’s. Landon’s favorite attraction was “the piggies” — pink piglets rooting around in a pen. Christopher, 26, recalled enjoying annual visits to Roba’s on school field trips during childhood.


  “We come here every year,” Christopher said. “I’ve been coming since I was little. Now, I’m just passing it on” to Landon.


  But a lack of school groups this fall because of the pandemic prompted Roba’s to open only four days a week instead of the usual six.


  Roba’s also instituted various COVID-19 protocols, including use of masks, frequent cleaning of common and high-touch areas and increased hand sanitizer stations.


  For social distancing, tickets are sold in advance with timed entrances to limit capacity, and seating and lines have been reconfigured for spacing. Staff members must pass a health check prior to each shift. The entire farm also has gone cashless, with credit cards, Apple Pay and cash-to-gift-card options available for payment.


  Meanwhile, adding produce at the orchard at 1649 Lakeland Drive in Scott Twp. produced a bounty. The orchard opened Aug. 1 and on Friday started a Halloween light show attraction.


  “We put in 6 to 10 acres of produce — potatoes, sweet corn, every vegetable you can think of — because we wanted to be pretty much secure that we could open our doors, being essential, agriculture, to get the people in,” she said.


  Roba Family Farms added an “Apple Cooler” refrigerated room inside the retail store to sell apples and cider from the orchard.


  Roba’s also is constructing a large food building called Jake’s Grill House to open in 2021.


  What began decades ago as a Christmas tree farm and pumpkin patch started by Sue’s husband, John Roba, has grown into a large-scale harvest hoedown park.


  The couple’s three children also work at the farm. Jennifer and Jeffrey work full time, while Jake, who has a career in Philadelphia, works seasonally part time on weekends. Sue’s siblings also help out and the operation has numerous employees.


  “We love it. I never dreamed it would be this big,” she said. “As John and I always say, when you love it as much as we do, it’s not really like going to work every day.”

This favourable global context is a blessing for the Rajapaksas. For example, the siblings are likely to use the excuse of the new constitution to disembowel provincial devolution. Provincial Councils will remain, with vastly reduced powers falling into the decentralisation rather than devolution category. Given Narendra Modi’s politics (especially his non-dependence on Tamil Nadu) India is likely to look the other way, so long as some appearances are maintained. A President Trump won’t even notice.

Taking the stage at a North Carolina rally to chants of "Fill that seat", the president said he would nominate his selection despite Democrats' objections.


  And, after conducting what he joked was a "very scientific poll" of the Fayetteville crowd as to whether supporters wanted a man or a woman, he declared the choice would be "a very talented, very brilliant woman".


  He added that he did not yet know whom he would choose.


  "We win an election and those are the consequences," said the president, who then seemed to signal that he'd be willing to accept a vote on his nominee during the lame duck period after the election. "We have a lot of time. We have plenty of time. We're talking about January 20th."


  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed on Friday night, hours after Ms Ginsburg's death, to call a vote on whomever Mr Trump nominated.


  But Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said any vote should come after the November 3 election. "Voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice to consider," Mr Biden said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is promising to put forth a female nominee in the coming week to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, pushing the Republican-controlled Senate to consider the pick without delay.


  Taking the stage Saturday night at a North Carolina rally to chants of “Fill that seat,” the president said he would nominate his selection despite Democrats' objections. And, after conducting what he joked was a “very scientific poll" of the Fayetteville crowd as to whether supporters wanted a man or a woman, he declared the choice would be “a very talented, very brilliant woman."


  He added that he did not yet know whom he would choose.


  “We win an election and those are the consequences,” said the president, who then seemed to signal that he'd be willing to accept a vote on his nominee during the lame-duck period after the election. “We have a lot of time. We have plenty of time. We're talking about January 20th."


  But one Republican senator had already broken ranks. Maine’s Susan Collins, who is in a tough reelection battle, said earlier Saturday that she believed replacing Ginsburg should be the decision of the president who is elected Nov. 3. Three more defections from the GOP ranks would be needed to stop Trump’s nominee from joining the court.


  At stake is a seat held by a justice who was a champion of women's rights and spent her final years on the bench as the unquestioned leader of the court’s liberal wing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. vowed to call a vote for Trump’s nominee, but Democrats countered that Republicans should follow the precedent that GOP legislators set in 2016 by refusing to consider a Supreme Court choice in the run-up to an election.

  Athletics in the county have not been able to play games against opponents since the season started and only get in one week of practice before their seasons were paused. Teams were able to start practicing Sept. 7 but last week could only condition due to changes in what was allowed in orange and are required to get in 14 practices before their first game.

Il comandante della motonave ‘Isola di Capraia’ ha voluto precisare i dettagli dell’avaria che si è presentata sull’imbarcazione di collegamento fra Termoli e Tremiti lo scorso 17 settembre.


  “La navigazione non è stata mai messa in pericolo nella maniera più assoluta in nessun istante della traversata contrariamente a quanto affermato nel vostro articolo. Non c’è stato alcun SOS conseguentemente non c’è stata alcuna attività di soccorso da parte di chicchessia, contrariamente a quanto a voi scritto. Lo sbarco dei passeggeri in realtà è avvenuta secondo una prassi consolidata quando non è possibile ormeggiare in sicurezza (vedi in condizioni meteo marine avverse), a mezzo locali motobarche autorizzata al trasporto passeggeri. Non c’è stato alcuno sbarco ed equipaggio come da voi oltraggiosamente affermato.


  Infine la nave al mio comando è rientrato a Termoli autonomamente in sicurezza con 25 passeggeri a bordo a conferma che non c’è stato pericolo alcuno per nessun passeggero e/o equipaggio. A prova di quanto sopra sostenuto c’è anche documentazione formale depositata presso la locale Capitaneria di porto (dichiarazione di evento straordinario previsto dal Codice della Navigazione).

Madonna riprenderà un po’ quest’andazzo con _Open Your Heart_ su _True Blue_ , chiaramente rendendo il tutto più tecnologico e mid-Eghties. In questo caso, tra leggeri echi dei B-52s si narra di una relazione in cui il partner non vuole fare altro che fuggire, per cui alla fine Madonna lo caccia a pedate fuori dalla porta in modo che assapori ciò che merita. La breve durata del brano lo rende potenzialmente una hit radiofonica dei tempi in cui viviamo.

Alex Ocean entered to the reaction of the night, and pulled multiple weapons from his pockets including skewers, syringes, and a lighter with lighter fluid. He offered Cogar a beer but Cogar batted it away. Ocean started in with strikes but quickly went for the chairs and drove one into Cogar's crotch. Cogar was quick to his feet and suddenly drilled Ocean in the head with a staple gun. Ocean absorbed the pain and showed off by punching the staples further in. On commentary Drennen said, "This is like wristlocks to these guys." Cogar pressed a bale of barbed wire into Ocean's forehead as Drennen lamented a lack of traction on the floor due to all the broken glass. Cogar landed an air raid crash onto a load of light tubes, then took some tubes that didn't break and smashed them across Ocean's midsection. Ocean reeled but came back with body blows. He snatched a syringe from the stage and poked it through Cogar's cheek. Drennen said, "I don't think that's the vaccine they're looking for." Cogar took Ocean's skewers and jammed them into Ocean's head. He slid the syringe from his cheek and playfully tossed it to Ocean's feet. Cogar arranged a sheet of glass across two chairs as Ocean sold on the stage. He dug the end of a broken tube into Ocean's head, then went to bulldog Ocean onto the glass. Ocean hit a low blow and tried to powerbomb Cogar through the glass but Cogar ducked away and chop-blocked Ocean's recently injured knee. The two rolled to the floor and Ocean suplexed Cogar through the glass for three.

"It's much too early to begin thinking about tautog fishing."


  Tommy looked at the man who made that statement like he had two heads.


  He quickly retorted, "What is the kid holding on the stringer?"


  I was caught in the middle of a dispute between two dedicated old time fishermen who had been catching tautog for well over 50 years. It was the second full week of September and I had been back to school for over two weeks and could not fish until late in the afternoon, after my mother was satisfied I had finished my homework assignment. Upon completion of my school work and chores, I changed clothes and headed to the shore.


  I turned over rocks and caught fiddler crabs, ribbed mussels and the occasional clam that had escaped the army of diggers and headed for the second pier. With my handline, a few spare hooks and sinkers inside the Maxwell House coffee can, I shimmied the rope up to the thick utility pipes that carried power cables to the Somerset shore then crawled out to the second granite abutment that supported the old green bridge. My target species were white perch, the feisty and tasty first cousin of the striped bass that favored that location on an incoming tide.


  I caught a single perch before the pesty choggies found me and began making short work of my mussels. I began hooking the fiddler crabs, so small that I baited two to a hook, but could not escape the voracious choggies that were tearing the bait apart with their sharp little teeth.


  After about an hour all I had was the lone perch and was down to a half dozen fiddlers when I felt a solid bite and reared back on the line. The fish pulled the tarred line around my thumb and forefinger so hard it burned the flesh.


  I fought it for a few minutes before I saw the head of a big white chinner swimming in circles just beneath the surface of the water. I was incredibly nervous because I had never hooked a tog that big from the bridge. That fish was still too lively and heavy to lift up to the top of the pier, so I attempted to drag it back to the shore via the pipeline. I was halfway there when the hook tore free and the fish swam away. I was heartbroken.


  From the time I first saw it, all I could think of was walking along the shore toward the clubhouse dragging my prize, but that was not to be. I lost my desire, but I had a few crabs left and less than five minutes later I had another heavy bite and set the hook.


  That fish gave a good account of itself and I was able to drag it over to the shore, where I covered it with sand to hide it while I crawled back to the pier to retrieve my tackle.


  The second tautog was nowhere near the size of the one I lost but it was still a big fish for that area, and I estimated it at about 18 inches, heavy enough to provide two thick fillets and a chunky head and rack of flesh to furnish the caretaker with stock for one of his superb chowders.


  Tommy's nickname was Tommy Togger, a moniker he earned because of his skill at catching bragging-sized tautog.


  Most of the old timers were still engaged in fishing for perch, digging clams and quahogs or pulling eels traps. That year the weather was mild for September, on occasion much too warm, with tautog fishing usually conducted in the early spring and late fall when the weather was colder.


  The day I dragged that tautog into the club I was wearing a short sleeve shirt and two of the younger members were pulling up to the dock with a tub full of blueshell crabs. To them it was still summer but to Tommy it was the onset of tautog season.


  Tommy asked me what I was doing on Saturday morning and when I replied that I intended to go fishing off the bridge, he invited me to join him and his friend on a trip to Hog Island Light. I had fished with the caretaker for scup there but had never for tautog. I was ecstatic.


  I am also afflicted with the fisherman's curse. I can't sleep well the night before a fishing trip, especially when I have to meet someone at an appointed hour. Whenever I have an alarm set I am prone to jump up in bed long before it rings in fear I have overslept. That was the case that night.


  I arrived at the boat house an hour before our appointed time and sat on the wharf watching the eels chasing mummies in the shadow of the clubhouse porch.


  Tommy arrived first and unlocked the door, then handed me a paper bag with a coffee milk and a very overstuffed jelly donut.


  Our host kept his boat up the Taunton River in the cove beyond O'Connell's boat yard at a place called Bessie's Beach. I soon spotted the bow wake of a handsome white boat making its way to the club and ran down the float to take his dock lines. His name was Larry and his handsome boat was a 15-foot lapstrake Lyman runabout, powered by a 15-horsepower Evinrude engine. We loaded up and pushed off from the float towards our destination.


  There was a world of difference between riding in a heavy flat bottom work skiff and a semi-vee hull powered by a powerful motor (a 15 HP engine was a big deal at that time) that pushed us along at what I considered a breathtaking pace as we cleared the Brightman, Slades Ferry and Mt Hope Bridges in short order and were soon setting the anchors just southwest of the Hog Island Light.


  Tommy filled the chum pot with ground quahogs, a few crushed green crabs and a can of cat food and set it off the stern.


  I was still unwinding my handline when Larry set the hook on a small 10-inch tautog, which was released, because when you fished with Tommy Togger all the smaller specimens and females were released.


  I recall a great morning on that beautiful boat with bright white paint and shining mahogany brightwork. I brought a towel which I used to wipe up any blood or bait that fell from the hooks onto the spotless deck. Larry noticed this and told Tommy a mate as attentive as "this boy" was welcome aboard any time. I was thrilled to hear that because the caretaker had instilled that trait in me.


  "Don't just stand around and fish. Be observant and clean up, cut bait or lend a hand and you'll receive many more invitations."


  We didn't set any records that day, but we did prove Tommy's theory that the tog were moving in. Our catch consisted of over a dozen nice tog from three to five pounds and one much larger that spit the hook just before Larry got a net under him.


  There are quite a few tautog on the inshore grounds now and more on the way, so don't wait until Columbus Day to begin the hunt; the bucktoothed ones with the beautiful smiles are now in residence.

Lubbock- Thomas Edward Tenner, Sr. passed away peacefully in his sleep in Lubbock TX, Friday, September 11, 2020. He was born in Pittsburgh, PA November 4, 1922 to Andrew R. Tenner, Sr. and Elizabeth McCoy Tenner. Tom was second of four siblings, Andrew, Alice and Margarete, all who preceded him in death. He is survived by his cousin Robert (Bobby) Tenner.      Tom was also preceded in death by his loving wife of 69 years Joan G. Schneider. They raised 5 children in their life together and are survived by Thomas E. Tenner, Jr. (wife, Linda) of Lubbock, TX., Andrea J. Tenner, (husband, Tom Poulos) of Irvine, CA., Mary Ellen Tenner of San Antonio, TX., Carol T. Augustine (husband, Web) of East Palo Alto, CA; and Clifford C. Tenner (wife, Arlene) of New Richmond, WI. Tom and Joan had twelve grandchildren and six great grandchildren.      Raised in Pittsburgh, Tom graduated from Central Catholic High at the top of his class. Tom served in the U.S. Navy from January, 1943 to January, 1946, and was Quarter Master (QM 1\C) on P.T. 127, Squadron 7 in New Guinea and the Philippines (WWII). He looked back on his time of service in the Navy proudly, and as a defining point of his life. With the help of the GI bill, Tom completed his Degree in Business Accounting at Robert Morris College. He became a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in Pennsylvania 1950 and in Texas 1960, after passing all of the CPA tests on the first round. Tom has been a member of AICPA since 1950.      Tom got to Texas to escape the "cold", and was first employed by Philco Distributors in Dallas. He worked for Earl McMillian Sales in Houston, TX for nine years before finally retiring. He was a highly respected financial controller. Although blissfully retired, he volunteered for ten years with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program.      Tom loved to sing. He was a soprano in the boys' choir at his childhood church. In 1978 Tom joined the St. Cyril's Catholic Church Choir in Houston. He sang in the tenor section thereafter for 20 years. Tom was an avid and excellent Bridge player all his adult life. When he wasn't playing bridge in his spare time, he enjoyed analyzing the US Congressional Budget. So that others could understand the US Budget, he consolidated the voluminous pages of this document onto a two page reference guide. He folded it neatly and compactly to fit into his front shirt pocket to serve as a quick reference at a moment's notice.

  # Adopt a Pet: Sputnik


  Beaver County Times


  Sputnik arrived at the Beaver County Humane Society about a month ago as a stray.


  The staff describes him as sweet and lovable, but is unsure how he would be with other cats or dogs but think with slow introductions, he would be a great addition to a multi-pet household.


  Sputnik has feline immunodeficiency virus, but it is not transmissible to humans. And animals in the same household cannot transmit the disease from one to another except by mating or by inflicting bite wounds, staff said.


  FIV-positive cats should see a vet twice a year for a physical exam and some lab work (a complete blood count, chemistry panel and urinalysis should be performed at least annually).


  Whenever they’re feeling poorly, FIV-positive cats should receive immediate care.


  FIV-positive cats should be spayed or neutered, live indoors only and steer clear of environmental exposure to infectious diseases (for example, raw food diets should be avoided).


  His $75 adoption fee includes vaccinations, health exams, microchipping, flea treatment, and neutering.


  The Center Township shelter is closed due to COVID-19 concerns but open for adoptions and fostering by appointment only. Anyone interested in temporarily fostering a pet may complete an online application at beavercountyhumanesociety.org.

Bloomberg) -- Bond investors who wagered on a group of malls owned by Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital Group are starting to take losses after the Covid-19 pandemic shuttered stores and wiped out emergency cash reserves that had been keeping interest payments flowing.


  The commercial-property bond, known as Starwood Retail Property Trust 2014-STAR, is backed by an almost $700 million defaulted loan. It’s cutting interest payouts to investors for a second time, after a reserve account dried up in June and a sharply lower property valuation led to the servicer holding back some funds.


  The bond’s performance shows how rapidly the pandemic is deepening losses in a sector that was already getting crushed by online shopping. Even the part of the bond deal that was once rated AAA -- meaning bond raters saw virtually no risk of taking losses just two months ago -- have now been cut deep into junk territory.


  “The experience of the mall CMBS from Starwood is certainly symptomatic of the larger narrative,” said Christopher Sullivan, chief investment officer of United Nations Federal Credit Union. Weakening mall asset fundamentals and fewer willing investors “will present ongoing financing problems.”


  A representative for Starwood declined to comment.


  S&P Global Ratings in July downgraded the entire Starwood commercial mortgage-backed security to speculative grade after a reappraisal of the four regional malls backing the debt valued them 66% lower than when the bond was issued.


  And while the servicer on the loan, Wells Fargo & Co., and borrower hope to restructure or modify the loan, the pandemic has put those plans on ice for now, according to a commentary by Wells.


  Cutting Back


  The servicer began slashing interest payments since June because the sharply lower appraisal triggered a CMBS protection mechanism known as an appraisal reduction amount. With the valuation so much lower, the ARA limits the amount of interest servicers have to advance on loans where the underlying collateral has declined in value.


  The idea is that the servicer will hold onto funds longer to safeguard senior bondholders.


  “Because of the appraisal reduction amount in place, the servicer is only advancing on a portion of the mortgage loan,” said Dennis Sim, a CMBS analyst at S&P.


  The Starwood loan defaulted at maturity last November when the borrower was unable to refinance, but the servicer paid investors out of a dwindling reserve account until June. Wells Fargo is now advancing smaller stopgap payments out of its own pocket.


  Total debt on the properties is $682 million. It’s tied to shopping malls anchored by struggling or bankrupt department chains including Nordstrom Inc. and J.C. Penney Co.


  The bond included debt linked to regional malls including The Mall at Wellington Green in Wellington, Florida, The Mall at Partridge Creek in Clinton Township, Michigan, and MacArthur Center in Norfolk, Virginia. Struggling collateral anchor Nordstrom shuttered stores at all three locations, according to Trepp.


  The slice of the CMBS originally rated AAA was last quoted at 69 cents on the dollar, according to Bloomberg data.


  The percentage of overall CMBS loans assumed by special workout servicers is increasing, going from 9.49% in July to 10.04% in August, according to Trepp. About 17.3% of retail loans were in special servicing in August, up from 16% in July, Trepp data show.

One of the two CPI-Maoist operatives, who got killed in an exchange of fire with police in Asifabad Kumarambheem district on Saturday night, was identified as Chukkalu.


  Ramagundam Police Commissioner and SP in-charge of the district, V. Satyanarayana, who visited the spot on Sunday morning, said Chukkalu was from Chattisgarh. The Maoist in his early 20s belonged to Pamedu area of Bijapur district.


  Information about his death was passed onto the district authorities of Bijapur. The second slain Maoist was yet to be identified. The exchange of fire started when police special parties combing the area reached interior parts of Kadamba forest in Kagaznagar sub-division of the district.


  “Another Maoist apparently sustained injuries but managed to flee the spot,” Mr. Satyanarayana said. A massive hunt was on to catch the remaining squad members. Chukkalu was a key operative of Mancherial-Kumarambheem division committee of the Maoists.


  Police believe he and other Maoists, led by CPI-Maoist Telangana State Committee member Bhaskar alias Adellu had been moving in the district for past three to four months.


  A 9 mm automatic Carbine, a 12 bore firearm and some literature was recovered from the spot. A letter from Maoist Central Committee condemning construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya was also found.

It’s been 10 years since a fourth-year starting quarterback has taken the field for Texas A&M.


  Jerrod Johnson was in that position in 2010, his fourth year in Aggieland, third as a starter. While he played in seven games that season, his fewest since his freshman year, he managed to claim A&M’s career records in passing yards, passing touchdowns and completions.


  For the first time since joining the SEC, A&M will have a returning senior starter under center in Kellen Mond. As would be expected for someone with Mond’s tenure, he has a chance to leave Aggieland with most of Johnson’s quarterbacking records.


  “He’s having an outstanding camp right now, and having a four-year starter, who knows how you think and what you want — now he’s finishing a lot of my sentences and the things we want,” head coach Jimbo Fisher said.

School districts with in-person instruction are now dealing with what to do when a student, teacher or employee tests positive for COVID-19.


  Dallas School District followed a plan that included notifying the state Department of Health when learning of its first COVID-19 case on Sept. 11. But district officials were not sure of what to disclose when informing parents, employees and the public.


  Dallas learned of a second case Sept. 13 and had canceled after-school activities, including a football game, over that weekend. The district issued announcements about the first two COVID-19 cases but didn’t specify if students or employees tested positive and didn’t identify an impacted school building.


  “I asked for a little bit of a legal review about the extent to which, what do we reveal and what don’t we reveal? Because at the end of the day, it’s people’s medical. It’s not an effort to be misleading,” Superintendent Thomas Duffy said Monday. “While we’re also attempting to keep our community well informed, we’re respecting the medical privacy of our stakeholders. Remember this stuff is really new to all of us.”


  When Dallas announced its third case Wednesday, Duffy disclosed all three cases involved students, two from the intermediate school and one from the middle school. The state Department of Health conducted contact tracing to identify anyone else who may have been exposed.


  Asked if the Department of Health has a guidance or standards on how school districts should notify the public of COVID-19 cases, spokesman Nate Wardle said “the schools will fulfill their safety plans to address the illness and virus in their communities, like done with measles, mumps, etc.”


  The health department is currently not releasing COVID-19 case numbers at schools in the state and numbers of students and school employees who tested positive. The health department is working with the state Department of Education and school districts “on the best ways to communicate increases in school-aged children,” Wardle said.


  “Obviously, it will take some time to link a case in a child to a school since there are different teaching models happening at the same time across the state,” Wardle said in an email.


  The health department “will share case data among school-age children moving forward” by releasing the statewide case numbers among 5-18-year-olds in data released each Monday, Wardle said.


  “Colleges are releasing data on their own in order to keep their communities informed,” Wardle said.


  Many colleges in the state are tracking COVID-19 cases with online dashboards. In Luzerne County, King’s College, Wilkes University, Misericordia University and Luzerne County Community College are providing online updates of case totals of students and employees and the number of students and employees in quarantine.


  The Pennsylvania State Education Association, the state teachers union, “supports legislation that ensures parents, employees, and other individuals associated with a school building are informed within 24 hours about any confirmed or presumptive cases of COVID-19 in their school,” PSEA spokesman Chris Lilienthal said.


  PSEA hopes the legislation currently before the state House gets a final vote by the end of the month, Lilienthal said.


  “Educators have been asking for clearer direction from the state level for months when it comes to informing a school community about cases of COVID-19, and this amendment ensures there is a statewide standard,” Lilienthal said in an email. “School districts would have the option of going beyond these requirements to meet the needs of their community.”


  Dallas, Northwest Area and Greater Nanticoke Area school districts began the school year with hybrid schedules involving online and in-person instruction days. Wilkes-Barre Area and Lake-Lehman started with in-person classes five days a week for students who did not choose a cyber option.


  Pittston Area, Hanover Area, Wyoming Valley West, Wyoming Area and Crestwood started with completely remote or online instruction.


  Greater Nanticoke Area Superintendent Ronald Grevera said he is not aware of any district employees or students testing positive since the school year began. The district “would never release the names of staff or students who are positive” and would inform parents about “potential exposure of the virus,” Grevera said.


  Greater Nanticoke Area has a plan for contact tracing “done through the use of seating charts in classrooms, cafeterias and school buses,” Grevera said.


  “In the case of multiple exposures outside of a family, we would simply close the school for cleaning for the recommended period of time,” he added.


  The Department of Education recommends canceling in-person classes for at least three days when there are two to four cases involving students and staff at a school over 14 days, or if the case total is less than 5% of the number of students and staff in a school. The recommendation is canceling in-person instruction for 14 days if it’s more than five cases, or the case total is at least 5% of the number of students and staff in a school.


  Lake-Lehman has a plan to immediately contact the Luzerne Intermediate Unit 18 when a student or employee tests positive, and the state health department is notified to investigate and conduct contact tracing and then provides the district “with specific instructions on how to proceed in regards to quarantine or any other preventative measures,” Superintendent James McGovern said.

BERNARD, Iowa — Connor Grant doesn’t pay much attention to baseball jinxes.


  In the fifth inning Saturday afternoon, he openly started discussing his ongoing no-hitter with teammates in the Cascade dugout. And it lasted three more innings until Zwingle speedster Isaac Evans singled sharply to right field to open the ninth.


  Grant became a clear-cut choice for the Bernard Tournament MVP award after tossing a complete-game one-hitter en route to a 6-0 victory in the championship game on a picture-perfect afternoon. It marked the 26-year-old right-hander’s third complete-game victory in the tournament, which had been delayed two weekends by rain.

Paris Hilton has made it her mission to close down America's toxic schools after experiencing a nightmare at an institution in Provo, Utah.


  The reality star was enrolled at the Provo Canyon boarding school for 11 months when she was 17.


  Paris recently told People magazine she was "bullied" by staff, who "were physically abusive, hitting and strangling us".


  Her revelations have prompted other women to come forward with horror tales from their school days, and now Paris has created a movement to shine a light on America's worst schools - and shut them all down.


  "I want to be a voice for the voiceless and I want to shut these places down," she told Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen.


  "People can come forward and tell their story and put #BreakingCodeSilence and we are starting a movement to make change," she added.


  Paris also revealed she has heard back from Provo Canyon school officials.


  "Of course they're saying that they deny it and that there's new management," she said, "but I've spoken to people who have just been pulled out of there, even like a week ago and the abuse is still happening, so they're just trying to cover themselves so they don't get sued."


  Paris goes into more detail about the hell she experienced at Provo Canyon and how the abuse has shaped her life in her new YouTube series This Is Paris.

In the medium term, the high-speed rail network will trigger exponential growth in domestic traveling-especially long-distance ones-and trade. And in the long term, the areas around the metros connected by the bullet trains will witness phenomenal spurt in manufacturing and processing industries, which would help realise the goals of "Make in India" campaign.

As his club faces a huge reduction to revenues, Perth Glory owner Tony Sage admits he may have to stand down players and staff at the A-League club if a pay dispute can't be resolved.


  Sage issued an open letter to Glory members on Sunday criticising Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) for rejecting a 30 per pay cut for the 2020-21 campaign.


  A-League clubs and the players' union have been in talks to broker a new collective bargaining agreement for a competition that has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.


  With uncertainty over gate figures and the future of a broadcast deal, Sage said the reality was players had to accept revenues were down across the competition and clubs needed to cut costs.


  "The clubs are the only group prepared to put money into the game at the moment," Sage's statement said.


  "In Perth Glory's case, our revenue from the broadcast rights has dropped by almost 50 per cent and in light of the unprecedented worldwide pandemic, our gate receipts remain uncertain because of WA's hard borders.


  "These border restrictions will be another huge hit to our revenue of about 30 per cent.


  "So in total, Glory's total revenue may drop by up to 75 per cent for the upcoming season."


  Sage said with the PFA and Australian Professional Football Clubs' Association (APFCA) failing to reach a new agreement, he is set to stand down players and staff.


  During the coronavirus enforced shutdown of the past season, all A-League clubs except Melbourne City, Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory stood down players.


  A short-term deal - which involved heavy player pay cuts - was then agreed on in order to complete the campaign.


  "Some other clubs will also stand down players and staff, other clubs may pay 50 per cent of current salaries, but all owners are unanimous in offering the players a 30 per cent reduction for the upcoming season because that's all the money there is," Sage said.


  The PFA were quick to respond to Sage's claims, saying talks were ongoing with clubs and Glory players were set to meet with their club on Monday.


  "Attempts to pressure the players through threats and misleading commentary is unhelpful and damaging, particularly while the players continue to work in good faith to reach a solution," co-chief executive Beau Busch said.


  The PFA has previously stated players have already had to make a financial sacrifice and it's unfair for them to be asked to accept further cuts for next season.


  The FFA is not directly involved in the negotiations but chief executive James Johnson has warned the governing body will intervene if the two parties cannot reach an agreement.

Lacking concrete details of the artist’s daily life, a biographer is tempted to fall back on the hypothetical. Young Rembrandt, according to Blom, “must have seen” this or “would have been familiar” with that. Writing of 18-year- old Rembrandt’s first trip to Amsterdam, Blom imagines Rembrandt’s first glimpse of the Netherlands’ largest city. “As the boat sailed across the IJ towards the harbor, its boom stretched out wide, the west wind propelling it forward, the silhouette of the city would have appeared to fill the entire horizon.” Perhaps. Or perhaps it was a foggy day, and the first view Rembrandt had of Amsterdam came when the docks loomed out of the mist.


  Such speculations aside, “Young Rembrandt” holds a wealth of historical tidbits about daily life in early 17th-century Holland, when painters kept their homemade paint in knotted pig bladders and coffins were stacked four to a tomb under the flagstones of the church floor.


  The worldwide notice given this past month to the re-attribution to Rembrandt of a small painting at Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum is a testament to the fascination the Dutch artist still holds for us. If “Young Rembrandt” does not wholly succeed in its quest to reanimate the young man setting out on the path that would bring him fame, Blom’s book does offer a tantalizing glimpse of the artist’s first steps.

But it's that era under Mourinho which has shaped Lampard's tenacity as a manager.


  Gone is Mr Nice Guy. Lampard is a born winner, and as such, is now in direct opposition to the man he left angry with his post-match comments.


  Klopp had no issue with Lampard's rant during the game, but certainly took umbrage with how his opposite number carried on.


  “For me, after the game, it’s completely over," Klopp said. "He has to learn to finish speaking about it after the final whistle, and he didn’t do that.


  “Speaking about it after the whistle is not okay.”


  Verbal handbags at best. But it elevated their rivalry to a new level ahead of Sunday's encounter between the sides at Stamford Bridge.


  Since their initial war of words Lampard has invested heavily in his squad on some big players - one of whom, Timo Werner, was snatched from under the noses of their Merseyside rivals.


  While Lampard has played down his side's hopes of pipping Liverpool to a trophy, he will no doubt be intrigued to see how close his new recruits will run the champions in their next meeting.


  His spending has even been a contentious point between the pair, as Klopp recently addressed Liverpool's lack of signings by stating his club "could not change overnight" and "behave like Chelsea".


  Those barbs could have easily been ignored by Lampard, but he's already in it for the long haul.


  "I was less annoyed with it, I found it slightly amusing," was his response.


  It wouldn't be the first time the managers of Liverpool and Chelsea clashed in this manner.

DUNLAP -- On the first day, the unexplained empty desk in the front row of Justin Hansen's third grade classroom at Wilder Waite Elementary School in Dunlap was alarming.


   


  The second day it filled Hansen with dread.


   


  "I had a bad feeling and at the end of the day the principal came in the room and dropped the news that (the student) had tested positive for COVID," Hansen said. "I had 15 minutes to leave the building and would not be allowed back in for two weeks. It was devastating."


   


  The 2020-21 school year is well underway and under circumstances no one anticipated, asked for, or wanted. The COVID-19 pandemic forced school districts across the country into struggles to find the safest solution to teaching students in a public health crisis. It created a generation of young people who will have to cope with an unprecedented and lengthy gap in the learning process.


   


  Before the school year started in mid-August, the Journal Star asked several areas school teachers about their hopes and preparations for the upcoming semester. At the time, concerns about social distancing, remote learning, deep cleans, hand sanitizing, hallway traffic, temperature checks and face masks outweighed the seemingly simpler concerns of items like curriculum and learning.


   


  We checked back in with those same teachers to see how things were going. Turns out one of them, Hansen, the third grade teacher at Dunlap's Wilder- Waite, got a close-up look at the perils of in-class learning when COVID-19 is sickening people -- some fatally -- across the community.


   


  "It defeated me for a while," Hansen said. "I had a whirlwind of thoughts about where this school year was headed. But I figured out I had a lot work to do, emails to send out, tutorials and videos to make and everything I could do trying to support my substitute. So I went to work without going in to work."


   


  Quarantine protocols removed the students in the front row and some in the second row -- anyone who spent 15 minutes or more within six feet of the person who tested positive -- for 14 days. Although another person has since tested positive at Wilder-Waite, all of Hansen's students, and Hansen, have returned to the classroom.


   


  "It's not normal," Hansen said. "You only have to look and see everyone wearing a face mask to understand that. But everybody -- teachers and students -- are working hard to make the learning as normal as possible."


   


  Better safety, but harder to find balance


   


  Nicole Clark teaches middle school English in Peoria Heights. A month ago, she predicted school that COVID-19 cases and quarantines would close the building down within two weeks. Now, she thinks things are both better and worse than she imagined.


   


  "The things I was most worried about, like health and safety, are so much better than I ever dreamed they would be," Clark said. "I attribute a lot of that to our district going above and beyond. Our classrooms are thoroughly disinfected every day, along with all high-touch surfaces like light switches, door handles, and railings. We've adopted a number of safety procedures for things, like lunches, to keep everyone safer, too. Thankfully, getting sick has honestly become a secondary concern."


   


  For Clark, the hardest part has been trying to meet the needs of both in- school learners and remote learners.


   


  "I am really struggling to find a balance, and most days feel like I'm working two full-time jobs," she said. "I want to give all my students the best education, but with movement restrictions, digital issues, face masks, shortened days, and not everyone in the room, it often feels like no one is getting what they need or deserve."


   


  It's not for lack of trying.


   


  "Administration has been so supportive and the teachers have really rallied to work together to do the best we can," Clark said.


   


  Teaching a language while masked


   


  Lauren Hanson teaches French to middle school students in Dunlap. Before school started, she struggled to find a way around the specific needs of language instruction -- students learn best when they can see a teacher's mouth form the words -- when everyone is wearing a face mask. Teacher included.


   


  "It's definitely been challenging to do discussion in class with the masks on, especially in French. I've been having to ask students to repeat themselves far more often than usual, not because they're saying something wrong but because I just can't hear them," Hanson said. "I never did find a mask where the kids can see my mouth that works perfectly, so I've been trying to talk really loudly so the kids don't have to ask me to repeat myself. I feel like I'm shouting at the kids through my mask sometimes."


   


  Personally, she feels safer in her classroom than she thought she might.


   


  "I was worried going into the year, honestly, but I'm starting to calm down about it some," Hanson said. "All the cleaning and safety procedures have become very routine, just part of our day. And the kids I work with are taking it in stride and being very conscientious of others and of their teachers, which is incredibly reassuring."


   


  'Better than expected' remote experience


   


  For Patrick Hogan, who teaches economics at Richwoods High School in Peoria, preparation for the new school year abruptly changed one night in August. The Peoria Public Schools Board of Education changed course and decided to move from a partial in-school schedule to all remote learning nine days before the scheduled start of the year.


   


  "I understand why the district made the decision to go to a distance learning model which puts the physical health of students and staff at the forefront," Hogan said. "I think most teachers understand it and are working as hard as they can to meet students' needs, whether they be content or social/emotional needs -- in the virtual format."


   


  All teachers and staff have had to make adjustments on the fly, Hogan said.


   


  "Overall, I believe it has gone better than expected in terms of connection. My students have all had the ability to get on our platform (Microsoft Teams) and seem to have the technology to participate in class," he said. "Attendance has been pretty good in all of my classes, very similar to a typical year."


   


  Not a 'rocky start' at all


   


  Although Dunlap started the year with a smattering of COVID-19 cases and subsequent quarantines, teacher Sarah Lueschow doesn't buy the premise that the district got off to "a rocky start" with its full-time in-school schedule. Lueschow teaches science at Dunlap High School.


   


  "Once we have our new routine down, things have been fine. I am seeing most of my in-person students. I personally have had very few students have to be quarantined," Lueschow said. "I personally do not think we got off to a rocky start, not compared to other stories you hear from other school districts. Yes, we had a few bugs to work out, like lunch, but, right now that is even working out all right. I do miss doing all the hands-on activities that I normally do with my students, we just need to be creative and come up with other options."


   


  From what she has observed, Lueschow said the students seem willing to be flexible, and appreciative of being back in the classroom.


   


  "I think students in person are adjusting just fine. I think they do better at wearing masks than I do. I hate the masks. We do have to remind them of social distancing if we go outside though," she said. "I do understand from the students' perspective of having contact, being next to their peers -- we are social creatures after all. I even just had a conversation with some students and they all mentioned that they were glad to be here in person as compared to remote."


   


  Justin Hansen's quarantine experience at Wilder-Waiter left a lasting impression, even if it doesn't affect his everyday behavior in the classroom


   


  "I think it is in the forefront of everybody's mind," he said. "I know a situation can change in an instant. You walk into school and you think 'could this be my last day for a while?'"

Wickham is a graduate of Western Dubuque High School and the University of Iowa. And rather than following a career as a litigator, he joined the parliamentarian’s office just a year after law school, in 1995.


  “It’s a unique position, where you’re dealing with the rules of the House and the members of Congress,” he said. “There’s no classes in law school to teach you how to be a parliamentarian.”


  Wickham was hired when former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich had the gavel. Since, he has worked under four speakers of the U.S. House of Representatives, including one twice — Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., John Boehner, R-Ohio, Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and now, Pelosi, again.


  He said that despite the prominent, powerful personalities of some of those speakers, his job did not change much between each.


  “Tom Wickham is a master of House rules and procedure, whose incisive legal acumen and absolute professionalism have strengthened the People’s House and benefitted the American people whom we serve,” Pelosi wrote in the statement announcing Wickham’s resignation.


  The Parliamentarian of the House may seem a low profile position for the layperson. Wickham has worked behind the scenes, usually opting not to weigh in on Congressional goings on — even when asked by his hometown newspaper.


  But, during that tenure, Wickham has given guidance to House leaders through some truly historic moments — including two impeachments.


  “Those experiences tend to steel you or get you ready for whatever might be coming around the bend,” he said. “So, it’s better, because you’re acting like a nonpartisan umpire, to have someone experienced.”


  Wickham worked as an assistant parliamentarian in the office beginning in 2005, then became a deputy parliamentarian in 2005, before getting his name on the door in 2012.


  He said that usually, the advice from his office to the presiding officer of the House was highly technical.


  “For an impeachment, for instance, it’s not on the substance of the allegations,” he said. “It’s how many committees are involved, what type of report is being formulated, how many articles — things like that, which are really separate from the alleged offense committed. It allows us to be technicians on those.”


  Wickham said that during his time in Washington, D.C., the job has had to adapt and evolve to both rapidly changing technology and growing political divisiveness. And, recently, the COVID-19 pandemic caused drastic changes, in which he had to be right in the middle.


  Now, he said he plans to take his time and cast a wide net to see what he does next. Pelosi appointed current Deputy Parliamentarian Jason Smith to take the post.

Then on the 14th, No Holds Barred 8 is scheduled to take place, also in Tampa. Demanto said he wanted to be honest about his feelings on death match wrestling. He said No Peace Underground has been on his radar for four years, but it's about time he involved them in "a weekend of ultra-violence in Florida." He called Florida historically the most violent territory in America, but he blamed promoters for going soft recently. He said "November is going to get very bloody."

ALBANY - The days of single-use plastic bags at New York grocery stores and retailers are about to come to an end, a year and a half after state lawmakers approved a ban.


   


  The state Department of Environmental Conservation said Friday it would begin enforcing the ban Oct. 19, meaning any store offering plastic bags after that date could face fines.


   


  The state agency signaled the change in a letter filed in state Supreme Court in Albany County, where a Long Island plastic bag company sued in an unsuccessful attempt to block the measure.


   


  The development seemingly puts an end to court wrangling and coronavirus- related delays that kept the state from enforcing the ban, allowing the bags to remain in many stores months after they were supposed to be prohibited.


   


  "The court's decision is a victory and a vindication of New York state's efforts to end the scourge of single-use plastic bags and a direct rebuke to the plastic bag manufacturers who tried to stop the law and DEC's regulations to implement it," DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos said in a statement.


   


  Ban a long time coming


   


  The state Legislature approved a bill in March 2019 banning stores from handing out single-use plastic bags to carry out goods, with exceptions for trash bags and bags used to carry produce, meat, fish, newspapers and restaurant takeout food.


   


  The measure is meant to combat plastic pollution by cutting by eliminating the bags that frequently get stuck in trees, litter the streets and pollute waterways.


   


  Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the measure into law. It technically took effect March 1, 2020, though the DEC didn't begin enforcing the measure immediately, choosing to allow stores a grace period to get used to the new law without facing a penalty.


   


  The law soon got wrapped up in the courts when Poly-Pak Industries of Long Island sued the DEC in mid-March, claiming the measure lacked a rational basis and conflicted with other state laws.


   


  Acting state Supreme Court Justice Gerald Connolly issued a preliminary injunction keeping the state from enforcing the ban. Then the coronavirus pandemic worsened, leading to court delays that helped keep the state from enforcing the ban for months.


   


  Over that time, some stores and grocery chains began reintroducing plastic bags while the court case dragged on.


   


  State agreed to give notice


   


  In mid-August, the state largely defeated the lawsuit, clearing the way for the ban to remain. The DEC agreed to give 30 days notice before it began enforcing the ban, which it did on Friday.


   


  Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, a group pushing for plastic-bag bans nationwide, said it was "good (the state's ban) will finally be enforced."


   


  "After the law is fully enforced, New Yorkers will see a noticeable decline in plastic bag litter in every corner of the state,"  said Enck, a former EPA regional administrator under President Barack Obama.


   


  Seggos, the DEC commissioner, said his agency is continuing to urge New York residents to make sure they're using reusable bags.


   


  "As we have for many months, DEC is encouraging New Yorkers to make the switch to reusable bags whenever and wherever they shop and to use common- sense precautions to keep reusable bags clean," he said.

John Fischetti, who waited in line more than two hours to enter Trump’s Fayetteville rally, said replacing Ginsburg would inflame tensions but was within the president’s rights.


  “I would assume it would make everyone more energized,” Fischetti said of the political repercussions. “Trump’s people want him to always press forward.”


  Four GOP defections could defeat a nomination, while a tie vote could be broken by Vice President Mike Pence. After Collins’ decision, focus grew on Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah, who have been critical of Trump and protective of the institution of the Senate.


  And because the Arizona Senate race is a special election, that seat could be filled as early as Nov. 30 — which would narrow the window for McConnell if the Democratic candidate, Mark Kelly, wins.


  The next pick could shape important decisions beyond abortion rights, including any legal challenges that may stem from the 2020 election. In the interim, if the court were to take cases with eight justices, 4-4 ties would revert the decision to a lower court; for instance, the Affordable Care Act could then be struck down by a lower Texas court.

How many of us have developed these ‘friends’ during lockdown, or perhaps even before, thanks to the weird connectedness you can feel on social media? And how many of us are desperate to meet them? Indeed, sometimes I find myself daydreaming about the day I am finally allowed to come face to face with Louise and Louisa and all the other people this pandemic has kept from me… and yet also, in a funny old way, brought me closer to. The circumstances our friendships have been forged in have made said friendships feel truly special and, for that, I will always be grateful.
