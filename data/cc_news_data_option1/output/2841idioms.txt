“The kidney is a ‘multi-tasking organ’ and even mild disturbances can knock it off kilter,” says Dr Sandeep Kapur, of London’s Mayo Clinic, who is the kidney lead in the Coverscan study. “The kidney removes waste and balances fluid levels. Kidney damage typically causes fluid retention so you can become a bit swollen, if things go wrong. When the kidneys fail the body becomes more acidotic which all cells dislike and it upsets their ability to function properly.” The kidneys also play an important role in producing hormones, says Dr Kapur.

The coronavirus pandemic got me thinking about my own BMI. I am 52, have had two children, and am healthy. I have a personal trainer twice a week, swim when I can, and try not to eat carbs with my evening meals (the glass of wine - or two - stays: one has to live). But there’s no doubt I have a few ‘life miles’ on the clock. There’s the hint of a double chin. More irksome still is the round stomach encouraged by medications prescribed for insomnia and depression in the mid-2010s — coupled with a sedentary lifestyle during that period.

President Donald Trump’s commutation of Roger Stone’s sentence is a body blow to two core democratic values.
 The first, and most immediate, is the principle of fair and impartial justice for all. It is a travesty that Stone — who was plainly guilty of serious crimes, who snubbed his nose repeatedly at the justice system, who continues to challenge his convictions — is now a free man. There is little that can be done now to reverse that injustice.
 The second principle is the public’s right to know, in this case about the full story of the 2016 election and the Trump campaign’s complicity in Russia’s attack on American institutions. Here Stone may yet be called to account, and that should be a goal shared across political boundaries.

Instead of sending his children back to school this fall, Jared Rich wants to create a new kind of learning system.
 He'd group his 3- and 4-year-old boys with several other students their age and, along with the other families' help, rent out a space -- perhaps a vacant Brooklyn storefront -- to transform it into a temporary classroom. They'd hire a teacher and maybe arrange for a nurse to come in several times a week to conduct Covid-19 tests and check for symptoms.
 "Essentially, you're creating a small bubble for your children to be with other children so they can maintain social interaction with human beings while being educated," he said. "As a parent, (you) want to do the best for your kid and want them to live a semi-normal life, to develop semi-normally. In such crucial developmental years, it's hard, it's horrifying."

There are a few glaring problems with those statements.
 First, brown water is still an ongoing issue in a good number of homes. Those people still have to pay to bring in clean water, even while still paying their water bills for the town water ruining their clothes and appliances. They have been spending extra on water for a while, so the commission’s spending complaints ring hollow.
 Second and most amazing is that any of the water/sewer commissioners has the gall to use the term “fiscal responsibility” when discussing their board, given their failure to properly manage the major ongoing piping project that has now doubled in cost from the original amount of the contractor’s bid.
 Just last month the board came back to taxpayers for another million dollars on this out-of-control boondoggle. It is at least the third time they have had to go to town meeting for more money. They cited “unforeseen issues” such as extra rock and ledge, claiming the project could not be finished without additional funding.
 Coming back once is understandable. Twice is more than questionable. Three times is both inexcusable and unforgivable. It represents a lack of planning, a lack of preparation, and gross mismanagement. What it most definitely does not represent is “fiscal responsibility”.

Shirley Freeman has been seeing therapists on and off for about six years, but not a single one has been Black.
 Her inability to find a mental health professional who shares her race and cultural background has made it difficult to heal from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe depression, Freeman, 30, told CNN.
 "What that translates to is that many of the cultural issues that I have to deal with aren't properly addressed because the therapist has no way to relate to my experiences on any level," she said.


--DocBreak--
Freeman described the circumstances as a "hot mess."
 "Many White therapists have a habit of dismissing the things that I say or making assumptions about my behavior or motivations based on my skin color," Freeman said. "A lack of diversity in therapy in the Black community also means that those of us that do seek help are less likely to find someone who understands the interconnectedness of what we go through versus who we are."
 Through Ayana, Coly aims to make Freeman's experience with mental health care a thing of the past.
 The four most important aspects of Ayana's matchmaking process is a person's race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. There are eight options for race and ethnicity, with subheads for each.
 "We get as detailed as possible. We want people to tell us, 'I don't want just a Black therapist, I want someone from Ethiopia. I'm not just Latino, but I'm from El Salvador,'" Coly said.
 "We also ask, 'How important is it to have a therapist that looks like you?' and people can answer, 'Oh, I want someone who's Black, and I don't care where they're from, but I want them to be queer,'" he said. "There's a variety of needs and we want to make sure we give our patients the therapist they need."
 Patients can also pick what religion they want their therapist to be, which can help resolve issues that stem from religious values and identity.
 By offering the service in app format, Freeman says it could even help overcome some of the stigma associated with mental health in the Black community, as well as many others.
 "The main thing is this mindset that the Black community has about mental illness. It's this idea that mental illness isn't something Black people go through or that it's not a luxury that we can afford like White people," Freeman said.
 With the app on a person's phone or tablet, it can be used privately and free of judgment.
 Ayana will cost $140 a month for unlimited texting and two half-hour phone calls, or $180 a month for four half-hour video calls and unlimited texting. So far, 260 therapists of different races, religions, sexual orientations and backgrounds are available on the platform.
 Coly has also partnered with three foundations to make the app free for individuals who can't afford the monthly fee.
