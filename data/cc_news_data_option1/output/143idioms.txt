2020 is now underway and it is time for me to make my annual tech predictions for the coming year.  


  Augmented reality will become more mainstream. Augmented reality (AR) takes real life (photos or videos) and overlays additional information or objects. Note that AR is different from virtual reality because virtual reality is 100% computer generated. This makes AR much harder as the computer needs to understand things such as what objects are, where the horizon is, etc. However, this is what makes AR much more valuable. AR has struggled as it requires so much data and image recognition. With machine learning making so much progress, in 2020 we should see AR getting better ... and to the point of having practical and usable mainstream applications.  


  Elon Musk will announce a new business. He has been quiet for a while on new ideas. This is understandable after all the turmoil he caused at Tesla recently from the apparently fake announcement Tesla was going private to making wild accusations about a person involved in a cave rescue (remember "pedo guy"?). But that all seems behind him now as his current businesses are hitting their stride including Tesla whose stock value is soaring and SpaceX which is beating Boeing handily for the next generation of manned space flight. Elon Musk must be itching to start something new again.  


  Amazon will continue to be the dominant e-retailer but Alibaba will make up much ground. If you have never heard of Alibaba, that is most likely because it isn't an American company. Alibaba is often referred to as the Amazon of China, but its business model is noticeably different. While Amazon sells mostly its own products with some merchants on board, Alibaba is focused on independent merchants. With Alibaba in many of the biggest growing markets in Asia, the company has had rapid growth. Here are a few comparison stats: Over the past year, Amazon stock has risen about 14%. Alibaba's has grown nearly 50%. Amazon's 2019 "Prime Day" sales (which lasted two days) were estimated at over $7 billion while Alibaba's "Singles Day" (which was only one day long) amounted to well over $38 billion.  


  The internet of things (IoT) community will have a serious and public discussion about security. It isn't that the internet of things hasn't talked about security or even taken security seriously. It is that there hasn't yet been the scale and concentration of IoT devices in U.S. households to make it a public target. For example, for a long time Mac computers were known to have less viruses ... that was because less people had them so there was less reason to target them. We are now at that point where serious and public discussions will have to take place, perhaps even new laws. Not only is it an invasion of privacy to have devices in our own homes hijacked, but those hijacked devices can be used against national security interests, such as launching a denial of service attack (DoS) against our government's systems.  


  More tech hubs outside of Silicon Valley will pop up and grow. Silicon Valley still will be a powerhouse for technology but the price of doing business there (and the culture) is starting to take its toll on many start-ups and established businesses. We are seeing cities both nationally and internationally trying to set up technology business hubs to attract residences, growth and tax dollars. Of course some are succeeding better than others but 2020 will see the trend continue with upward momentum.

Clemson will need to rely on forcing mistakes while limiting his own.

Clemson has generated a margin of over 14 in the last seven games and has not had a negative margin in a game since playing North Carolina in September.

2) "Loss given recession" has increased: With such low level of rates, central banks have less room to maneuver. "A common response is that while monetary policy has less space, fiscal policy can and should step in and save the day whenever the next recession looms. After all, low interest rates coupled with central banks' ability and willingness to purchase (more) government bonds create more fiscal space for governments. In theory, we agree and have in fact argued for some time that fiscal policy is likely to become more proactive in the future. In practice, however, it is unlikely that governments and parliaments are able to diagnose recession risks early enough and, even if so, implement fiscal easing in time to prevent a recession, given the slow way in which political processes usually work. Thus, central banks will still have to be the first responders in the next crisis and, again, will be more constrained than they have been in the past," Pimco says.

Adina cântă din voce, cântă la flaut, la pian, la fluiere românești și caval, compune și predă muzică.A studiat la Universitatea Națională de Muzică București, apoi și-a continuat studiile de master la Universitatea Salford din Manchester, unde a avut niște performanțe remarcabile și unde a ajuns să predea și altor studenți ce o pasionează pe ea cel mai mult.

While the recently approved supplemental budget restored funding for numerous important statewide programs for education, summer literacy, county jail reimbursements, new prison officers, road patrols, PILOT payments to communities, no-fault auto insurance reform, the independent redistricting commission and other programs, Pure Michigan funding was not included in the supplemental budget.
 That’s a real blow to communities large and small that partner with Travel Michigan/Michigan Economic Development Corporation to spread the Pure Michigan message to Midwestern, national and international audiences, bringing new visitors, new revenues, and new investment to Michigan.
 Muskegon has worked hard for decades to shed its Rust Belt image and grow as a destination. We market our offerings to visitors outside our state, and this loss of funding for the national campaign will be a severe financial setback for Muskegon and all Michigan destinations moving forward.
 The old adage, “out of sight, out of mind” holds true here. Colorado’s legislature zeroed out the state’s tourism budget in 1993 and their market share fell by 30% in two years, with revenue losses estimated at $1.4 billion per year. Funding was eventually restored in 2000, but by that time Colorado was losing $2 billion per year in tourism revenues.
 The nationwide reach and success of the Pure Michigan campaign has contributed tens of millions of dollars of investment in Muskegon County alone, not to mention many other communities across the state that are investing in destination development.
 Muskegon County has invested $19.7 million in development of a new convention center; an $8.2 million investment transformed a tired hotel in downtown Muskegon into a Delta by Marriott with a new full-service bistro-themed hotel restaurant; a new, branded hotel and a restaurant/entertainment facility are set to break ground in downtown Muskegon in spring 2020, representing an $18.5 million investment; and at least four new restaurants, two new breweries, two distilleries, and two brewery production facilities have opened or will open in Muskegon County in 2019 and 2020, representing an investment of more than $9 million.
 Michigan’s Adventure – Muskegon’s largest attraction and the state’s largest theme park – will be making a substantial investment in Camp Snoopy, a five- ride Peanuts-themed attraction set to open in May 2020 at the 250-acre theme park and water park.

The art form with which Kunisada distinguished himself was a phenomenon that only Edo (today Tokyo) had to offer. Its roots go back to the city's origins and the political and economic reforms that Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543-1616) and his heirs adopted after the country unified in 1600. These started in a nutshell with urbanization and economic development. With the expansion of business and government activities, the demand for trained workers followed. This in turn increased literary rates. The merchants became wealthy and increasingly self-confident, although they limited themselves to the lowest level of the social ladder. Over time, Edo grew into a large metropolis - it had 1 million inhabitants in the early 1720s - and since there was a population made up of men and full of idle samurai, the demand for entertainment increased.

By admitting that its own missile shot down the Ukraine International Airlines jet last week, Iran has put an end to a debate on who could have been behind the disaster. The country should now reach out to those nations whose unsuspecting citizens became the victims what it calls an act of “human error” (Front page, “Iran admits its missile shot down Ukraine jet,” Jan. 12). In this context, one is reminded of a similar incident in 1988 when a guided missile cruiser of U.S. Navy shot down Iran Air Flight 655 over Iran’s territorial waters, killing all 290 people on board. It took quite some time for the then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan to express regret while still insisting that the country’s officers acted in self-defence. In contrast, Tehran has been more gracious in acknowledging its mistake. In this regard, the UN must take the initiative and devise a more effective mechanism for averting such tragedies in future.


  S.K. Choudhury,


  Bengaluru


  It may be possible for Iran to compensate the kin of the victims but it remains to be seen how the country will bring the guilty to book. In this context, it may be recalled that the U.S. has not only never expressed remorse for shooting down an Iranian passenger plane using a surface-to-air missile in 1988, it has also shown the audacity to maintain that there was no improper use of force. Its payment of compensation later was only a tacit admission of guilt.


  C.G. Kuriakose,


  Kothamangalam, Kerala


  Though the Iranian authorities magnanimously accepted their mistake, shooting down a civilian plane was an unpardonable act. In the war-like situation prevailing in Iran, there was a possibility of the missile man mistaking the passenger jet for a cruise missile. But, that cannot be taken as an excuse, when there were communication facilities available between the pilot and the airport. The guilty should be made accountable and punished, as demanded by Ukraine.


  D. Sethuraman,


  Chennai


  Iran’s mea culpa in the tragic shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger jet is a sign of contrition, but its attempt to trivialise the disaster’s cause as a missile operator’s misjudgment glosses over its complicity in creating a war- like situation by the frenzied ratcheting up of tensions after the assassination of one of its top generals. Iran’s right to self-defence and its right to retaliate against the U.S for the unprovoked killing of a military commander provided it with a margin of international support and sympathy. But even an undeclared war demands nations to ensure the safety of civilians likely to be in the crossfire of fighting. When Iran planned a missile attack against American targets, it should have issued a ‘no flight’ advisory to civilian aircraft using Iranian airspace. The avoidable loss of human lives makes the wrangling over the intricacies of international laws a travesty. Having admitted its horrific mistake, Iran should carry forward the process of healing and reconciliation by offering fair financial compensation to the families of the ill-fated jet’s crew and passengers without waiting for the international law’s protracted proceedings to run their normal course.

Queen Elizabeth has summoned her grandson Prince Harry for a crisis meeting to discuss future arrangements for him and his wife Meghan following the couple's shock announcement that they want to step back from royal duties.
 Harry's father Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, and his elder brother Prince William, will also attend the meeting, due to take place on Monday at the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, eastern England, a Buckingham Palace source told Reuters.
 Meghan, an American former TV actress, will try to join via telephone from Canada where she returned earlier in the week to rejoin the couple's baby son, Archie.
 Harry and Meghan, officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, surprised the rest of the royal family on Wednesday by publicly announcing they wanted a "new working model" that would allow them to spend more time in North America and to be financially independent.
 They did not consult the 93-year-old monarch or other members of the family before making their announcement on a new website, sussexroyal.com, a move which hurt and disappointed the Queen and other royals, according to a royal source.
 The meeting on Monday will be the first time the senior royals have met in person to discuss the concerns raised by Harry and Meghan.
 Officials had been holding talks behind the scenes since the bombshell statement to try to work out a new arrangement for the couple, and a royal source said those efforts progressed well.
 The consultations, which also included the British and Canadian governments, paved the way for a face-to-face meeting between Harry and the Queen.
 The palace source said it remained the Queen's aim to a find a resolution to the crisis in days rather than weeks but it would require "complex and thoughtful discussions" and any agreement would take time to be implemented.
 The split between Harry and the other Windsors is the latest crisis the royal family has faced in a period described last month as "bumpy" by the Queen in a televised annual address.
 Such is the global interest in Harry and Meghan that their news has overshadowed a scandal surrounding the Queen's second son Prince Andrew and his friendship with disgraced late U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who hanged himself in jail in August while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.
 In an emotional TV interview last October, Harry admitted he and William had fallen out.
  _The Sunday Times_ newspaper said the elder prince had spoken of his sadness at the rift. The brothers were close for years following the death of their mother Princess Diana in a Paris car crash in 1997.
 The newspaper quoted William as saying to an unnamed friend: "I've put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can't do that any more, we're separate entities.
 "I'm sad about that. All we can do, and all I can do, is try and support them and hope that the time comes when we're all singing from the same page. I want everyone to play on the team."
 Earlier on Saturday, the _Times_ newspaper reported that Meghan had agreed to do voiceover work for Disney in return for the company making a donation to a charity she supports that works to protect elephants.
 A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the report. Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

State of Texas: Fighting threats from abroad and close to home


--DocBreak--
It should have been easy. My parents had moved into assisted living. I was trying to be helpful last spring and get their house ready for sale.  


  My work began with getting rid of junk -- anything worn, broken, useless, or outdated. Their tiny third bedroom had become a repository of all things medical -- wheelchair parts, mattress pads, first aid supplies, rehab appliances, hospital stay plastic ware, grabbers, canes, even a pair of ski poles that a doctor told Mom would help with stability. This mini-warehouse was overflowing, and included an alarming supply of unused, outdated medications. Mom had been on pain pills of many kinds for years. With dosage and prescription changes, discarded pills accumulated quickly. Then Dad got sick, and the stockpile of pills became truly impressive -- rivaling most pharmacies. It seemed inevitable, with the house now uninhabited, that some crazed druggie would break in and have a field day with the pharmaceuticals. Time to neutralize those nasty narcotics!  


  In the old days, it was okay to flush pills down the commode, but now we must dispose of them "properly." So where DO you get rid of old prescription medicines? Calling several local police stations didn't answer that question. Pleasant-sounding officers apologized, saying drug drop-offs were only once a year, and not happening again soon. I couldn't believe my ears. The very agencies trying to get drugs off the streets didn't want to take unused medications EVERY day? Unthinkable! It made no sense.  


  Fast forward to Thanksgiving week. I'm back in Pennsylvania again. The pills are right where I left them. It freaks me out. Finally, a poster catches my eye--one of the police stations is taking medications. Hallelujah!  


  I call to be certain. "Yes," the officer says. "Bring it in any time between 8:00 a.m. and midnight." So, bright and early Monday morning, I walk confidently up to the station door with my crate of contraband -- but the door is locked.  


  I knock. For fifteen minutes, I dial every phone number listed on the door, three times. I look around for a hidden camera because nobody's answering. Surely, they see me. Finally, I access the website and tap the number there. Aha! A voice -- a live voice!  


  "I'm outside the front door and it's locked," I explain. A short silence.  


  "Where are you?" he asks.  


  "At the front door of the police station," I repeat.  


  "No, I mean what city?" I tell him. Another short silence. "Oh, okay, I just checked the schedule and no one's on duty there today. They only have a part- time police force. Sorry, but you'll have to go to either…" and he named two stations in nearby towns--where they are NOT having drug drop-off days, naturally.  


  Resigned to my bad luck, I lug the box of booty back to the car. Next stop, the State Highway Patrol barracks. Surely, at the state leve l… but no. "I'm sorry, it's just once a year." One kind officer had pity on what must've been my sincerely forlorn face. "Check with CVS Pharmacy. Sometimes they take pills." Yeah, right.  


  But I'm desperate, so I drive straight there, knowing the answer to my question before I ask. "Do you take outdated meds?" I enquire at the pharmacy window.  


  "Well, no …" (See?) "But there's a drop box where you can leave them," she added, pointing to my right.  


  "Really?" Unbelieving, I turn. There it is -- a beautiful, white drop box…at last. Well now, that was easy, wasn't it?!

Metro: Suspect behind bars after crashing into local bar


--DocBreak--
PHOENIX – Last week Arizona Governor Doug Ducey made a formal request for federal funds in order to fund a bridge over a dangerous creek near Lake Roosevelt.


  On Jan. 8, Ducey sent a letter to U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao asking her to “prioritize funding” towards a bridge over the Bar X crossing in Gila County.


  According to a release from the governor's office, the creek divides a community of 1,500 residents and separates them from a number of necessities including school and healthcare.


  The issue received a wide amount of interest following a tragedy over the holidays last year when a family attempting to ford the creek during rising flood waters was swept away, causing the death of three children between 5 and 6 years old.


  Following the incident, Arizona Lawmakers proposed setting aside $20 million dollars in order to build a bridge over the crossing. Efforts had been made before but the county is unable to afford a project of that magnitude and requests for federal dollars in the past have met with no success. Ducey has been seemingly reluctant to have the state foot the bill as he, thus far, has not chosen to commit to those funds and instead issued this request for federal funding.


  “Residents need a bridge over Tonto Creek for basic safety and quality of life needs,” Ducey said in his letter to Chao. “Since 1995, eight people have died while attempting to cross in their vehicles during high-water times; three children lost their lives while crossing in a vehicle the day after Thanksgiving less than two months ago.”


  In the press release, Ducey seems keen to target $1 billion dollars in funds from the BUILD Grant program that was part of the 2020 fiscal year spending bills signed by President Trump in December.


  “The Arizona Department of Transportation stands ready to provide technical review and assistance to Gila County through its BUILD Grant application,” Ducey said. “I look forward to offering my continued support.”

Irving's return does create an interesting dilemma for Nets coach Kenny Atkinson, though. Spencer Dinwiddie has been playing some All-Star-caliber ball while starting at the point position in Irving's absence. On the season he's averaging 22.5 points, 6.4 assists and 3.2 rebounds per game -- numbers that represent career-highs for the sixth-year guard, and his play has been a big reason that the Nets have been able to stay in the playoff picture. Now that Irving is back, does Atkinson move Dinwiddie back to a reserve role, or does he start Irving and Dinwiddie together in Brooklyn's backcourt and make adjustments elsewhere?
 Atkinson has certainly considered his options, but he hasn't committed to any specific rotations yet. Instead, it's likely that Brooklyn's rotation will be fluid upon Irving's return, as Atkinson tinkers to see which combinations of players work best together.
 "That'd be a tough tandem to match up with," Atkinson said of playing Irving and Dinwiddie together earlier this week. "And Spencer can obviously guard off the ball easy -- he's 6'6" -- so that's good, too. And Spencer's a two-way player. It's exciting to think what it could be. You could have Caris, Kyrie and Spencer. You know, that was kind of obviously in the original plans. You could play them as a finishing lineup. I wouldn't hesitate to do that at all. My job at the end of the day is to do the best for the team, what's going to fit best for the team concept."
 No matter what Atkinson does, Dinwiddie's usage and opportunities are going to drop, as Irving excels with the ball in his hands, and he will have it, a lot. Overall though, the Nets' outlook is obviously improved, as teams will now have to account for two dynamic guards when they play the Nets. Brooklyn won't reach its full potential as a team until Kevin Durant joins the active roster next season, but Irving's return should certainly provide them with a big boost for the rest of this season.

In addition to that, radical growth of the ecommerce industry is also expected to open new opportunities in this market, particularly in the Asia Pacific region. On the other hand, growing preference for air suspension systems, rising number of car-sharing services, and stringent government regulation for owning luxury cars are obstructing the market from attaining its true potential. The analysts of the report also highlights increasing preference for strut coils over spring setups in light commercial vehicles in Europe and growing usage of composite leaf springs as couple of trends of this market.

The Grain Palace literally ended with a bang. Most of the equipment of Company L of the South Dakota State Guard was inside at the time of the fire “including 2,000 rifle cartridges which cleared the area when they began exploding,” according to an Aberdeen Daily News story that ran April 28, 1902, the morning after the fire.


  It was a big loss for the city because the palace served the city well, hosting lots of events. It was a large meeting and show hall with a stage, kind of like Mitchell’s Corn Palace. It was both a convention hall and, outside the building, an exposition grounds.


  Such palaces were all the rage back in the day. The Mitchell building is the last of 34 “prairie palaces” built throughout the Midwest from the 1880s to 1930s. You can see and read about them in Rod Evans’ interesting book “Palaces on the Prairie.”


  Evans and others speculate that Aberdeen resident and famous author L. Frank Baum might have gained some inspiration during his short time here for his later writing of “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” experiencing a tornado and seeing balloon launches in Aberdeen in 1889 and 1890. And, Evans writes, “Had Baum remained in the city a couple of more years perhaps Aberdeen’s Grain Palace would have become world renowned, having been described in detail as the Wizard’s palace.”


  Like Mitchell’s Corn Palace, which features huge exterior murals made with different colors of corn, Aberdeen’s Grain Palace reportedly was generously decorated with grasses and grains. But so far only the only photos found show it as plain, with flat-planked outside walls and interior decorations made from grains. Still, it was the center of Aberdeen’s social life, a big hall with room for more than 1,000 people, pushed to close to 2,000 at times, early news reports indicate, with many more outside.


  The idea for Aberdeen’s Grain Palace began when a corporation was formed with plans to build and operate the palace during state fairs, which at the time were held in different cities through the years.


  Businesses pledged money to the Inter-State Grain Palace Association, the group organized to build the Palace, according to the 1980 “Brown County History” book. Many residents took part in decorating for its opening on Sept. 11, 1893, which the book describes as a 13-day festival filled with bands playing, theatrical productions and a concluding night planned to climax the week with an on-stage wedding, but the bride backed out at the last minute.


  The Grain Palace days were the heyday for amateur theatricals, but many other events took place there, including musical programs, melodrama, political conventions and even livestock shows. Many famous people spoke there, including presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan who stopped in 1895, the history book says. (Don Artz’ “The Town in the Frog Pond” book says 1896.) There were 10 special trains bringing huge crowds, and hundreds more came by wagons for his three addresses, first at the Grain Palace, then at the opera house and Sherman Hotel.


  News reports also tell of thousands of people who showed up to see President William McKinley, who spoke at the Grain Palace following a huge parade down Main Street in 1899. And presidential candidate Theodore Roosevelt spoke from an outside stand set up at the palace in 1900.


  The palace was the center of Aberdeen’s celebratory life, Artz writes:


  “It was convention hall, exposition grounds, opera house, theater, and community church, all in one. It was more, though. It was a symbol of the young city’s energy and unity, its ability to persevere in hard times,” he writes in his “Frog Pond” book.

Their rivalry is renewed Sunday at Lambeau Field, with a berth in the NFC Championship Game on the line. The teams arrived at this NFC Divisional contest in opposite fashions: the Packers closed out the season with five straight victories—some in rather ugly fashion—after getting blown out in San Francisco on November 24 to earn a No. 2 playoff seed and bye.

"It wasn't changed in translation. I don't know where that rumor started," Mnuchin said on the "Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo" show.
 "We have been going through a translation process that I think we said was really a technical issue," Mnuchin said. "And the language will be released this week. So I think it is — the day of the signing, we will be releasing the English version.
 "And people can see. This is a very, very extensive agreement," he added.
 White House officials had said as late as Friday that the final Chinese text was not yet completed, even as invitations went out to more than 200 people for a Jan. 15 signing event at the White House.
 Asked if he still expected China to purchase $40 billion to $50 billion in U.S. farm products under the deal, Mnuchin said: "I do. Let me just say, it is $200 billion of additional products across the board over the next two years, and, specifically in agriculture, $40 billion to $50 billion."
 Thus far, Beijing has not confirmed those purchase commitments, and recent government actions www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china- agriculture/hopes-for-spike-in-us-farm-exports-to-china-dim-ahead-of-trade- deal-signing-idUSKBN1Z82CJ in the agriculture industry have raised questions over the $40 billion to $50 billion target cited repeatedly by Trump administration officials.
 Chinese officials have been careful not to publicly discuss details of the Phase 1 deal, because Washington has changed its position multiple times during negotiations, three Chinese officials with knowledge of the situation told Reuters last week.
 Signing of the trade deal on Wednesday eases Trump's 18-month trade war aimed at altering China's trade and economic practices, but will leave in place tariffs on about $370 billion worth of Chinese imports per year.
 Those are expected to be addressed in "Phase 2" negotiations, which the Trump administration wants to launch this year, covering thornier issues untouched by the Phase 1 trade deal, including Beijing's heavy subsidies to Chinese state-owned enterprises and restrictions digital trade and cybersecurity issues.
