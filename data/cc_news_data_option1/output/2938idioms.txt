Under ideal circumstances, a Franklin County group working to establish a lab to test ideas for countering poverty would have a full-time leader in place and be off and running on efforts to help lift poor residents from their economic doldrums.
   
 That was the direction the panel behind what's being called the "Rise Together Innovation Center" was headed back in January, with a job description in hand and hopes of hiring an executive director by midyear.
   
 But that was before the coronavirus pandemic, community demonstrations against racism, and a who-knows-what's-next year that has upended lives and the best- laid plans.
       Get the news delivered to your inbox: Sign up for our politics newsletter     
 County officials aren't too worried about the delayed hiring, though, saying work on the Innovation Center is continuing, with racial disparities highlighted by COVID-19 and civil unrest making the work even more important.
   
 "I would hope that by the end of the year, we would have an announcement of someone," said Trudy Bartley associate vice president, local government and community relations at Ohio State University and co-chairwoman of the leadership council. "… It's about the right person. … It's too impactful in the lives of everyone in central Ohio. We've got to have that innovative, progressive thinker who can really bring people together, that is really going to make a difference in the success of not only the blueprint but of the success of the big ideas that come out of the innovation hub."
   
 The Innovation Center was a capstone of the Franklin County commissioners' "Rise Together Blueprint," a plan to address longstanding poverty in central Ohio and provide a means to connect needy residents to the types of economic opportunities others have enjoyed.
   
 The plan was developed after months of meetings and discussions and included more than a dozen recommendations, with a commitment from the county of more than $13 million to help implement the ideas. Some ideas have already been instituted -- ongoing racial equity training for county employees and others and a larger affordable housing effort to direct more public support for developments to help needy residents secure homes, for example.
   
 The commissioners also named a leadership council to establish the Innovation Center, a think tank to study ideas for countering poverty, including gauging the feasibility of an expanded childcare subsidy and universal preschool program open to all Franklin County youth.
   
 "(The Innovation Center) isn't another nonprofit, it's not a human services organization," said Matt Habash, president and chief executive officer of the Mid-Ohio Foodbank, who also serves as co-chairman leadership council. "It's about us all realizing current scenarios are not acceptable long-term."
   
 There has been progress on establishing the center, Bartley said. A project manager, Tiffany Wright, has been hired. Proposal requests are being circulated as part of efforts to find an executive director.
   
 "We are going slow to move fast," Bartley said. "We want the right person. There is no room for error. … We have a plan, and it's time to execute it."
   
 The commissioners also are set to vote Tuesday on a fiscal sponsorship agreement with the United Way of Central Ohio to handle the initial accounting and other administrative functions for the Innovation Center. County Administrator Kenneth Wilson said the center will share office space Downtown with Smart Columbus for now.
   
 Franklin County Commissioner Kevin Boyce said he's satisfied with progress to date.
   
 "It's still moving, and it's still progressing," he said.
   
 Commissioner John O'Grady added, "These were never going to be easy decisions, where to locate, who to lead… This was always going to take discussion, this was always going to take time."
   
 Addressing disparities and systemic racism was part of the county's poverty discussions long before the widespread demonstrations that followed the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis officers.
   
 The issues have been front and center this year for the Innovation Center leadership council.
   
 "Racism is an overarching theme of poverty," said Joy Bivens, director of Franklin County Job and Family Services. "I think people conceptualized it then… but when you visually see it, you're bombarded with it on the news and social media… I am excited and pleased to see that we have so many diverse groups coming together to be intentional about addressing racism. I haven't seen it like this before."
   
 Bartley added, "We have very open, honest and intentional conversations withe each other and had some really hard behind-the-scenes conversations… as far as the importance of aligning our resources to make a difference for individuals who are in poverty…."

TROY, Ala. (AP) " Civil rights icon and longtime Georgia congressman John Lewis was remembered Saturday " in the rural Alabama county where his story began " as a humble man who sprang from his family's farm with a vision that 'good trouble' could change the world.
 The morning service in the city of Troy in rural Pike County was held at Troy University, where Lewis would often playfully remind the chancellor that he was denied admission in 1957 because he was Black, and where decades later he was awarded an honorary doctorate.
 Lewis, who became a civil rights icon and a longtime Georgia congressman, died July 17 at the age of 80.
 Saturday morning's service was titled 'The Boy from Troy,' the nickname the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave Lewis at their first meeting in 1958 in Montgomery. King had sent the 18-year-old Lewis a round-trip bus ticket because Lewis was interested in trying to attend the then-all-white university in Troy, just 10 miles (16 kilometers) from his family's farm in Pike County.
 It was the first of six days of memorials and services.
 On Sunday, his flag-draped casket is to be carried across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, where the one-time 'Freedom Rider' was among civil rights demonstrators beaten by state troopers in 1965. He also was to lie in repose at the state Capitol in Montgomery. After another memorial at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, where he will lie in state, funeral services will be held in Georgia.
 At the Troy University service, his brothers and sisters recalled Lewis " who was called Robert at home " as a boy who practiced preaching and singing gospel songs and was scared of thunder. And as a young man who left with a mind to change the world.
 'I remember the day that John left home. Mother told him not to get in trouble, not to get in the way ... but we all know that John got in trouble, got in the way but it was a good trouble,' his brother Samuel Lewis said.
 'And all of the troubles that he got himself into would change the world,' Samuel Lewis said.
 Lewis's casket was in the university's arena where attendees were seated spaced apart and masks were required for entry because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 'The John Lewis I want you to know about is the John Lewis who would gravitate to the least of us,' his brother Henry Grant Lewis said. Even as a busy congressman, he always made time to attend family functions or to make a surprise appearance at a school or birthday party.
 His brother said on the day Lewis was sworn in to Congress that they exchanged a thumbs up. He later asked Lewis what he was thinking when they did. 'He said 'I was thinking this is a long way from the cotton fields of Alabama,'' Henry Grant Lewis recalled.
 Those cotton fields were in then-segregated Pike County, where Lewis as a child winced at the signs designating 'whites only" locations.
 At his 1958 meeting with King, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy and civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, Lewis talked about the possibility of a lawsuit to try to integrate the university at Troy, Gray recently recalled. The lawsuit ultimately did not happen because of concerns about retaliation his parents would face in the majority-white county.
 'Even before he met Dr. King, he was interested in doing something about doing away with segregation. And he did it all his life,' Gray told The Associated Press.
 Lewis was one of 10 children born into a sharecropping family. His parents saved enough money to buy their own farm where the Lewis children worked the fields and tended the animals. A young Lewis was less fond of field work " often grousing about the grueling task " but eagerly took on the job of tending the chickens while practicing preaching.
 In his autobiography, 'Walking with the Wind,' Lewis described how as a youngster he longed to go the county's public library but wasn't allowed because it was for whites only.
 'Even an eight-year-old could see there was something terribly wrong about that,' Lewis wrote.
 He would eventually apply for a library card there, knowing he would be refused, in what he considered his first official act of resistance to racial apartheid.
 In 1955, he heard a new voice on the radio: King, who was leading the Montgomery bus boycott about 50 miles (80 kilometers) away.
 Lewis became a leader of the Freedom Riders, often facing violent and angry crowds, and was jailed dozens of times. In 1961, he was beaten after arriving at the same Montgomery station where he arrived three years earlier to meet King. In 1965, his skull was fractured on the bridge in Selma when law enforcement officers beat civil rights marchers in a melee became known as Bloody Sunday.
 President Barack Obama in 2011 awarded Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom saying he was 'an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time."
 Last year, Lewis announced he had been diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer.
 His sister Rosa Tyner told The Associated Press that about a week before his death she asked him about possibly seeing another doctor, but that he declined. 'He said, 'No, I'm at peace. I'm at peace and I'm ready to go,'' she said.
 His sister Ethel Mae Tyner said Saturday that, 'this not a goodbye. It's just a different kind of hello.
 'Rest well, Robert. Rest well."

CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - Opposing protesters continue to gather in downtown Charleston at the Battery on weekends.On Sunday morning, activists groups from across the Lowcountry that support the Black Lives Matter movement stood in front of the Confederate Defenders Statue.Activist groups say they want the City of Charleston to put limits on where and how people can fly the Confederate Flag in public.They say they are taking a stand against the Confederate Flag and its supporters among other things.Protester Jason Jones opposes the flag. He's also the Co-Founder of an activist group called Change is Coming and is creating a new organization that unites local group leaders."They need to revisit their history, get beyond the history they were taught in grade school and the slanted glorification of the Confederate Army and their flag," Jones said.For the last five years, the group Flags Across the South say they've been flying Confederate flags at the statue at the battery. They disagree with those who view it as a symbol of hate.Braxton Spivey is with the group Flags Across the South.“That was a soldiers banner no more no less,” Spivey said. “I firmly believe this, the reason people today look at that flag the way they do is because other organization after the war picked it up and they basically disgraced the Confederate soldier’s banner.”Activists groups including, Stand As 1, are also calling into question the City of Charleston's permitting process.The groups say they were granted a city permit to protest in front of the statue Sunday, sending the flag supporters across the street. However, they say they believe previous permit requests were wrongfully denied.Spivey said he had no comment in regards to their display location moving across the street from the statue.The activist groups are also asking the city to remove or deny the display of the confederate flags on public property and to cut back on the recent increased policing in the city.In addition, the BLM protesters said they would like the city to remove the use of ‘oversized flags,’ larger than 3x6, at events and displays."We do hope that our presence here will not be needed for long, we ask that our elected officials do the right thing for the city," Protester, Justin Hunt said.Hunt is also the President of the Stand As 1 Activist Group.Protesters say they will continue to show up at the Battery as long as the Confederate flag is flying.The City of Charleston is expected to provide a comment at a later time.Copyright 2020 WCSC.

BOSTON -- Whether it ultimately fell on Sunday or Monday, Zack Godley was ready to make his Red Sox debut.
 Boston hoped to stay away from the right-hander during the series finale with the Orioles and feature him in the first of two games with the Mets.
 Godley was recalled from the alternate summer camp site at Pawtucket on Sunday. Dylan Covey was optioned two McCoy Stadium in the corresponding move after throwing two innings in his own Red Sox debut on Saturday.
 "I'm looking forward to any opportunity I can get to pitch, whether it's starting or out of the bullpen," Godley said. "Just excited to be able to try to help this team."
 Godley worked twice for Boston during its preparation for Opening Day on Friday. He threw multiple innings in an intrasquad contest and then logged three scoreless innings in Wednesday's exhibition game against the Blue Jays.
 "He's probably going to pitch somewhere, whether it's starting or coming in as kind of an opener," Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke said. "But it kind of also has to do with what happens in today's game -- whether he starts or whether he comes in for the opener."
 Godley was in camp with the Tigers before being released. He drove from Detroit to his South Carolina home and spent one day there before agreeing to a deal with the Red Sox. Godley was barely off his flight when he took the mound here for the first time.
 "It was nice to get out there and get off the mound and get that rust off, and then turn around and throw the way I did against the Blue Jays," Godley said. "That was nice."
 Godley debuted with the Diamondbacks five years ago and enjoyed his most productive seasons with the club in 2017 and 2018. He posted a 3.37 earned run average to help Arizona reach the National League playoffs in 2017 and struck out 185 across 178-1/3 innings in 2018. Current Boston bench coach Jerry Narron served in the same capacity with Arizona during that time.
 "Jerry is an amazing person," Godley said. "He's one of the best staff guys I've ever been around."
 Roenicke said left-hander Matt Hall is likely to start or serve in the bulk role Tuesday against New York. The Red Sox have yet to decide whether or not they will feature an opener ahead of Hall or piece together multiple innings behind him.
 Taking a knee
 Jackie Bradley Jr. took a knee for Sunday's national anthem and was joined by at least one Red Sox teammate for the second time this weekend.
 Alex Verdugo also engaged in peaceful protest prior to the last of three games with the Orioles. Bradley spoke at length about his decision to kneel Friday night and did so in all three games. Verdugo offered his own reasoning following Saturday afternoon's contest.
 "Me kneeling was more to show there's injustice and inequality going on in the world," Verdugo said. "It's just something I feel like was important for myself and also just to have Jackie."
 Bradley, Verdugo, third base coach Carlos Febles and first base coach Tom Goodwin were among those who took a knee Friday night. Bradley and assistant athletic trainer Brandon Henry did so on Saturday.
 "I think there are a lot of things that need to be addressed, and I want to bring attention," Verdugo said. "That's all. I want to use my platform to have a little bit of awareness and maybe help out a little bit."
 Verdugo collected three hits in his Boston debut, a 7-2 loss to the Orioles. Two of those came in left-left matchups with Paul Fry and Richard Bleier.
 Back to the max
 The Red Sox are back to the maximum 60 players in their summer camp pool.
 Boston claimed left-handed pitcher Stephen Gonsalves off waivers on Saturday and assigned him to the alternate site at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket.
 The 26-year-old Gonsalves was designated for assignment by the Mets prior to making an appearance for the club this season. He debuted with the Twins in 2018, pitching in seven games, and has worked 121 times in the minor leagues. Only 10 of his professional appearances have come out of the bullpen.
 Gonsalves went 2-2 with Minnesota, posting a 6.57 earned run average. He allowed 28 hits and walked 22 in just 24-2/3 innings. Gonsalves suffered a preseason elbow injury in 2019 and was eventually designated for assignment.
 Gonsalves is a 6-foot-5 San Diego native who prepped at private power Cathedral Catholic. He was drafted in the fourth round by Minnesota in 2013 and put together four straight strong minor league seasons from 2015-18. Gonsalves eclipsed 115 strikeouts and appeared in at least 20 games in all four years, compiling ERAs of 2.01 in 2015, 2.06 in 2016, 3.27 in 2017 and 2.76 in 2018.
 The Red Sox now have just one open spot on their 40-man roster.

ORLANDO -- Florida's top business regulator said Saturday that he planned to set up meetings with bar owners to discuss how they can reopen their businesses again safely, as the Sunshine State surpassed New York State in the total number of coronavirus cases.
   
 Halsey Beshears, secretary of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, said he planned to start setting up meetings with owners of bars and breweries across the state later this week to discuss how they can reopen without spreading the virus.
   
 Late last month, Florida banned alcohol consumption at its bars, for the second time this year, in response to a spike in the number of coronavirus cases.
   
 "We will come up with a Safe, Smart and Step-by-step plan based on input, science and relative facts on how to reopen as soon as possible," Beshears tweeted.
   
 Last week, members of Florida's craft brewing industry sent a letter to Beshears and Gov. Ron DeSantis, warning that almost a third of the 320 craft breweries in Florida could be forced to go out of business in the upcoming weeks if the restriction on on-site consumption continues.
   
 "The health of our community is paramount, but it cannot be at the life savings of hundreds of entrepreneurs, the livelihood of thousands of families and the majority of an entire industry," the letter said.
   
 The Florida Department of Health reported 12,199 new cases Saturday, bringing the state's total since March 1 to 414,511 cases. Florida surpassed New York State's 411,200 cases and is now trailing only California in having the nation's largest caseload.
   
 Florida also reported 126 new deaths, raising that total since the start of the pandemic to 5,894 fatalities on Saturday. By comparison, New York State has had more than 25,100 deaths.
