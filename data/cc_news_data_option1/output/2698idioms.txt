Buxton hit .262 with a .314 on-base percentage and a .513 slugging percentage with 10 homers and a career-high 30 doubles last season in 87 games and flashed the tools that made him such a dynamic player when he was healthy.
 “He impacts the game on every aspect, I think, hitting wise, baserunning, mentally too, just to have him next to you on the bench is awesome. But his defense is like no other,” right fielder Max Kepler said. “I think the best I’ve ever seen. I’m definitely super-excited to have him back on the field.”
 But Buxton also landed on the injured list three separate times: Once after getting hit on the wrist by a pitch, once after coming down hard while making a diving catch and the third and final time when he injured his shoulder running into a wall in Miami.

Buxton is now fully healthy after a spring training in which his readiness for Opening Day was up in the air. The center fielder had surgery to repair his left shoulder labrum and had just started taking live batting practice at the time that spring training shut down.
