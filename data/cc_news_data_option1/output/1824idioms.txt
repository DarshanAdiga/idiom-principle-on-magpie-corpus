They thought it wouldn't be very long before returning to work, so they started baking for neighbors for fun to keep busy. Then, when they realized sheltering in place would last a lot longer than expected, they decided to start a business with their baked goods to pay rent.
 Stagg said it exploded from there. It has turned into a business. The bakery was recently incorporated with an LLC and registered with the state of California.
 "We have been blessed with an astronomical amount of support, and all of our success is because of the community and the people," Stagg said.
 A restaurant unable to be in business during the pandemic has even donated their kitchen so the bakery could have a commissary kitchen to make and store their product.
 Stagg said that the bakery is serving up bread, cookies and cinnamon rolls. Customers order the goods online through the bakery's website.
 Right now, the bakery is only open select hours, but Stagg said it may be a matter of time before their success overtakes the part-time hours.
 The pop-up is already turning into a more permanent establishment and the two plan to continue Bernal Bakery even after the pandemic is over.

Following the Friday announcement that most of the Pittsburgh region is moving into the yellow phase of reopening, the Diocese of Pittsburgh revealed plans for the gradual reopening of churches.
 Churches will be allowed to reopen for private prayer and the Sacrament of Reconciliation.
 “The decision to suspend public Masses and close church buildings was truly heartbreaking, but it was made with the health and well-being of the community in mind,” Zubik said. “We have, and will continue to be vigilant in doing our part to help ‘flatten the curve’ of the spread of COVID-19.”
 The changes will take effect Friday, when four more counties in the diocese – Allegheny, Butler, Greene, and Washington – will move to the state’s yellow level of reopening. Lawrence County moved to yellow on Friday. Beaver County remains in the red phase, with the strictest stay-at-home orders still in place.

Bernard Lerman   05/08/2020   It is with great sadness that we announce that Bernard Lerman, 89, passed away peacefully from natural causes the morning of May 8, 2020, in his room at Pine Run Lakeview, Doylestown, Pa.   Bernie (Lefty, Butch, Berel) was a first generation immigrant from Poland. He lived the first 60 years of his life in Brooklyn, N.Y. - Williamsburg, East New York then Canarsie. In the '90s he, along with his wife of 63 years, Carole (1935-2018), retired to the Pocono Mountains. There they enjoyed their friends in "The Young & The Rest of Us" club. In 2015, they moved to the Pine Run retirement community. Bernie was an U.S. Army veteran of the Korean War. While only a high school graduate (Eastern District High School), Bernie worked his whole life in business, from bookkeeping to credit management in the textile industry, enabling him to proudly send both of his children to college and enjoy a nice retirement. He was a true family man, whose first priority was always the care and protection of his family. Bernie's favorite pastimes were fishing, bowling, playing poker, and visiting with his grandchildren.   Bernie is survived by his sister, Helen Tapick; two daughters, Finette Russak and Elycia Lerman and her wife, Anita; four grandchildren, Jason (and Andrea), Samantha, and Evan Russak, Saidah Lerman; two 'adopted grandchildren' Dustin Lynn-Becket and Meagan Warner; and two great grandchildren, Abigail and Nathaniel Russak.

Interim CEO Rob Clarke is making big inroads at Rugby Australia after less than a week in the job, earning praise from Super Rugby clubs.
 Brought in with RA and the game in crisis, Clarke has moved swiftly to fill a troubling vacuum following predecessor Raelene Castle's resignation two weeks ago, which led to a failed power play by would-be chairman Peter Wiggs before he quit.
 The upheaval left a remodelled domestic competition to replace Super Rugby during the coronavirus pandemic among many tasks needing swift attention.
 Melbourne Rebels boss Baden Stephenson said that Clarke had seized control and given the Super Rugby clubs confidence in the path forward.
 A previous CEO of the Rebels and Brumbies who also had two stints as RA's chief operating officer, Clarke was able to hit the ground running.
 As well as his domestic rugby experience, Clarke has ties to NZ Rugby, has a personal relationship with decision-makers at rugby's estranged broadcaster Fox Sports and has already had meetings with SANZAAR and World Rugby.
 He briefed all of the Super Rugby heads last Thursday, providing timelines for a return to play on July 3. All players are set to return to training by May 18.
 "That gave everyone a bit of comfort," Stephenson said.
 "Rob's an experienced guy and he's a relational leader and he will provide some good stability and decision making and he's been clear on what he needs to get done."
 Stephenson said little was being achieved in the two weeks between Castle and Clarke.
 "There wasn't a lot of clarity and no-one could make decisions so there was a bit of frustration building away.
 "I know Rob is keen to make sure the narrative around rugby and the communication around the game and how it's progressing, and the transparency, will definitely improve."
 Wiggs sought to install former RA deputy and current Australian Olympic Committee CEO Matt Carroll as the new RA CEO under himself as new chairman.
 But the board decided it needed to follow due process and check all options in the recruiting process, leading to Carroll withdrawing his interest and Wiggs quitting.
 Carroll, whose rugby administrator experience goes back 30 years, told AAP on Saturday he and Wiggs believed they would complement each other and he was upset at claims of a perceived conflict of interest because they were friends from club rugby days.
 "I think it was terribly unfortunate that there was some suggestion that my friendship with Peter Wiggs had any sort of problems because I played rugby with hundreds of people over the years and I consider quite a lot of them friends," Carroll told AAP.
 "Peter and I never had any business dealings or business connections whatsoever. We were in two totally different worlds, it's just that I have great respect for his ability and he has great respect for mine.
 "It was the combination of his business ability and my sports administration ability that would be proposed to the executive."
 Carroll said the only governance issue lay with RA, with repeated leaks meaning the media broke news of his proposal before he had a chance to tell the AOC.
 "The most unfortunate thing was that we were told that it wasn't good governance, but then I think board confidentiality is probably the best governance practice," he said.
 "The leaks from the Rugby Australia board ... I've never in my entire life of sports administration experienced it, and I've experienced a lot of boards, so that was terribly unfortunate."

OK, maybe I can strum some guitar chords and have a penchant for remembering lyrics without consulting an iPad. But considering just the number of people I know personally who have genuine musical talent, I hesitate to put myself in anything resembling a similar category.                  That doesn’t stop me from making noise, so to speak, when presented with even the slightest opportunity.                  So when COVID-19 started obligating the responsible parties among us to stay home, freeing up some of the time I usually spend sitting in traffic jams, I decided to present a live stream of what I termed “An Exercise In Self-Indulgence,” properly crediting the expression to the subtitle of a song by the rock band Rush.                  For the better part of three hours, I sat in front of a cellphone – my image reversed, it turned out, making it look as if I were left-handed – and put on a concert of sorts.                  I’ve played to live audiences for years and years, ever since I was old enough to stop caring what other people think of my, uh, talents. But I was really nervous about the live stream.                  In fact, I compare it to the classic episode of “The Honeymooners” – actually, they all are classics – in which Ralph is all set to portray the Chef of the Future, and then he’s reminded that he’ll be in front of thousands of TV viewers. He freaks out, and Norton has to save the day.

The Athenaeum's archives are peppered with examples of women who fought to preserve Portsmouth's heritage and houses, organized grand historical pageants and, 100 years ago, won the right to vote after decades of activism.
   
 Marilla Marks Young Ricker (1840-1920) was the first woman admitted to the New Hampshire bar in 1890 after taking her battle all the way to the state Supreme Court. She ran for governor in 1910, even though the Secretary of State would not allow her name on the ballot.
   
 "Her filing papers were refused because, as a woman, she was not registered to vote and thus not allowed to run," states a bio of RIcker on the League of Women Voters of New Hampshire website.
   
 "I'm running for governor in order to get people in the habit of thinking of women as governors. ... people have to think about a thing for several centuries before they can get acclimated to the idea. I want to start the ball a-rolling," she is quoted as saying in an August 1913 Boston Herald article by Gertrude Stevenson.
   
 It was not until 1996 that New Hampshire elected its first female governor, Jeanne Shaheen, now in her second term as a U.S. senator.
   
 Marilla Marks Young, born in New Durham to a family of free thinkers, studied at Colby Academy (now Colby-Sawyer College) in New London and taught school. At 23, she married John Ricker of Dover. He died in 1868, leaving her a young and wealthy widow. At age 30, she is believed to be the first woman to try to vote in New Hampshire, but she was denied a ballot by the Dover town clerk.
   
 It would be the first of her many attempts to vote.
   
 Most of Ricker's working years were spent in Washington, D.C., where she was known as the "prisoners' friend" for her pro bono work of applying for releases and pardons.
   
 In her later years, she served as president of the New Hampshire Woman Suffrage Association. Her portrait now hangs in the New Hampshire State House in Concord, thanks to a years-long effort by a group of state legislators and donations from more than 80 people and organizations.
   
 Ricker died of a stroke on Nov. 12, 1920, three months after the federal passage of the 19th Amendment.
   
 Ten days earlier, Ohio Republican Warren G. Harding was voted into the White House. Did Marilla get to legally vote before she died? It's not clear.
   
 Suffragist Virginia Tanner Green (1881-1950) of New Castle is perhaps best known as the author and director of the city of Portsmouth's tercentenary celebration in August 1923, "The Pageant of Portsmouth."
   
 The Athenaeum has a scrapbook donated in 1997 by her family that is filled with newspaper clippings that detail her many activities. The 1905 Radcliffe graduate married 1905 Harvard Law graduate Louis Green, who was a Portsmouth High School graduate. The couple lived in Cambridge, Mass., but summered in the Seacoast. In New Castle, they had an estate called Greentan, a combination of their surnames.
   
 The Harvard Graduates Magazine of 1916 notes that Virginia Tanner Green staged the opera, dances and ballet of the Radcliffe Choral Society's performance of Gluck's "Orpheus" and raised $300 for a scholarship fund.
   
 In August 1923 she wrote and directed the 300th celebration for Portsmouth, which had a cast of hundreds made up of residents of Portsmouth, Dover, Exeter, Greenland, the Isles of Shoals, New Castle, Newington, Rye and Kittery, Maine.
   
 Characters depicted included Passaconaway, the leader of the Penacooks; French explorer Samuel Champlain; Capt. John Smith of Pocahontas fame; and American patriot Paul Revere.
   
 The Portsmouth Herald declared it a "dazzling, inspiring spectacle."
   
 In 1930, Green was still at it, applying for a copyright for a 1928 pageant she created in celebration of the official dedication of the Carlton Bridge in Bath, Maine.
   
 Green was also involved in historic preservation of historic houses in Portsmouth. But the scrapbook's most dynamic image is of her leading a suffragist victory party in Boston. The Boston Photo News. Co. image is dated May 3, 1914.
   
 Before the Athenaeum was closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, its 2020 Program Series had a number of events planned related to New Hampshire's role in politics.
   
 It is hoped we'll be open in time for an Oct. 21 talk by Liz Tentarelli, president of the League of Women Voters of New Hampshire on "The Campaign for Women's Right to Vote." Using historic photos and documents, Tentarelli will start with the 1848 Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y. and conclude with the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920.

The gaming compact Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signed with the Comanche Nation is a "provocative attack on Chickasaw Nation sovereignty," writes Chickasaw Nation Gov. Bill Anoatubby.
   
 Wichita and Affiliated Tribes President Terri Parton describes that compact as "a direct threat to the jurisdictional and governmental authority of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes."
   
 Anoatubby and Parton are among leaders and attorneys of a number of Oklahoma tribes who have joined Oklahoma Attorney Gen. Mike Hunter in writing letters to the U.S. Department of the Interior urging rejection of Stitt's proposed gaming compacts with the Comanche Nation and Otoe-Missouria Tribe.
   
 The depth of the bad feelings the gaming compacts have created between Oklahoma tribes became clear this past week when other gaming tribes voted to suspend the Comanche and Otoe-Missouria tribes from membership in the Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association.
   
 Leaders of other tribes are incensed by provisions in the compacts that purport to offer the state's approval for the Comanche Nation and Otoe- Missiouria Tribe to pursue federal authorization to construct new casinos outside their traditional tribal jurisdictions and, in some cases, within the tribal jurisdictions of other tribes.
   
 Under terms of the agreements now awaiting federal approval, the Otoe- Missouria Tribe would receive the governor's blessing to build three new casinos in Logan, Noble and Payne counties, while the Comanche Nation would receive the governor's approval to build new casinos in Cleveland, Grady and Love counties.
   
 All or portions of those counties lie outside the traditional jurisdictions of the Otoe-Missiouria Tribe and Comanche Nation and within the jurisdictions of the Caddo, Citizen Potawatomi, Delaware, Iowa, Ponca, Sac & Fox, Chickasaw and Wichita & Affiliated Tribes, Stephen Greetham, senior counsel for the Chickasaw Nation, said in a 22-page legal analysis of the compacts prepared for Gov. Anoatubby.
   
 "Off-reservation trust acquisitions are always controversial, but these provisions seem particularly designed to provoke discord and to disrupt Oklahoma Indian country," Greetham wrote.
   
 Granting state approval for the Comanche Nation to build a Love County casino in the middle of the Chickasaw Nation's tribal jurisdiction signals "a profound disrespect for Tribes and Tribal sovereignty, on the part of both Governor Stitt and, unfortunately, the Comanche Nation," Greetham wrote.
   
 Quapaw Nation Business Committee Chairman John L. Berrey expressed similar concerns in his letter to U. S. Department of Interior officials.
   
 "Gov. Stitt's strategy is transparent -- he wants to bully Oklahoma tribes until we pay him to stop," Berrey wrote. "Throughout the course of the governor's ruse, he has attempted to divide Oklahoma's tribal nations, which would make it easier for him to get an agreement he wants."
   
 "The Governor is pitting tribes against one another to see which tribe will pay the most for a long-shot opportunity at prime gaming location," Berrey stated. "Gov. Stitt has had two takers so far, and has stated that he intends to continue dealing. If he is not stopped, the end-result will be a second 'land run,' where the state would get increased revenue and authority, while the tribes concede sovereignty in exchange for unfulfilled governmental promises."
   
 In the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes' letter to Department of the Interior, Parton cited numerous previous instances where federal officials have rejected compact language that purported to authorize casinos on land not already within a tribe's jurisdiction.
   
 "Likewise, the Comanche and Otoe proposed compacts should be disapproved because of the illusory nature of the Governor's purported prospective off- reservation gaming acquisition concurrence," Parton stated.
   
 Rob Rosette, attorney for the Comanche and Otoe-Missouria tribes, acknowledged that obtaining federal approval to build a casino outside of a tribe's traditional jurisdiction is a long and difficult process and said it is uncertain whether the two tribes would seek to do that if the compacts are approved.
   
 However, he said the tribes have historical and modern ties to the land that he believes could make federal approval possible.
   
 "If and when they ever pursue an off-reservation location, … they believe that they're up to the task to provide all the information necessary to pass scrutiny of the federal government," Rosette said.
   
 Rosette said obtaining the approval of a governor in a state is often one of the most difficult hurdles to clear in gaining federal approval. He said if the compacts receive federal approval, at least the tribes would be that far along if they should decide to move forward.
   
 The letters that the attorney general and leaders of other tribes have written to the Department of the Interior cite numerous reasons they believe the compacts are illegal, including provisions designed to to permit the two tribes to engage in sports betting and house-banked card and table games.
   
 Attorney General Hunter has written an official attorney general opinion that those types of games are not permissible under state law.Meanwhile, the Oklahoma governor's office and Comanche and Otoe-Missouria leaders have staunchly defended the two compacts, with the governor's office contending they are not only legal, but also that they "deliver unprecedented guarantees of clarity, stability, and transparency for all sovereign parties."
   
 The U.S. Department of the Interior is required to render its decision on the two compacts by June 8. The federal agency can approve them, reject them, or let them go into effect without action.
   
 Even if the compacts gain federal approval, it would not be a green light for the two tribes to engage in everything mentioned in the compacts.
   
 The tribes could not, for example, start building casinos outside their tribal jurisdictions without obtaining further federal government authorization.
   
 Whether or not they could start taking sports bets is unclear. Stitt and the Comanche and Otoe-Missouria tribes have taken the position that federal law preempts state law on Indian gaming matters so sports betting would be allowed.
   
 Other tribes see it differently.
   
 "Even if it's deemed approved by Interior, that doesn't mean they don't have state law problems," said Sara Hill, attorney general for the Cherokee Nation. "If it is deemed approved it would just be the beginning of possible state challenges and tribal challenges of these compacts."
   
 "House-banked card games, house-banked table games and events wagering or sports book would remain criminal acts under Oklahoma law, so a non-tribal Oklahoma citizen who may go to one of these facilities would be violating state law and subject to criminal sanctions and penalties," contends Greetham, the attorney for the Chickasaw Nation.
   
 "This is why it's so important to follow the rules and make sure each of the governments that have an interest in these compacts are fully onboard with the authority to bind themselves," Greetham said. "If you don't, you'll end up playing Whack a Mole with all of the myriad of legal issues that will come up and result in litigation and destabilize economic activity in Oklahoma."

In total, the CMA's taskforce has reportedly written to 187 traders after receiving 2,500 complaints about price rises.
 One of these was Nisa.
 "Last week we were approached by the CMA following a number of consumer complaints about unusually high prices in Nisa partner stores," a leaked document to retailers from Nisa, seen by publisher betterRetailing, explains.
 "We are aware that in some instances this has been down to products coming off promotion, newly introduced lines or pricing being higher on some substituted lines," it read.
 "But, we would advise where this is the case, you highlight the reasons for the higher prices, either on the shelf edge or on posters around the store, to avoid consumer confusion and frustration."
 According to the leaked document, nearly 75 per cent of complaints related to food and drink, 20 per cent related to hygiene products and around 5 per cent related to medicines.
 Nisa retailer Harj Dhasee said that, despite increases, he is continuing to sell at wholesale prices to protect his reputation.
 "Milk cost price is £1, but we are selling it at £1," he told the website.
 "We haven’t moved our prices because we don’t want to be seen to be profiteering, but at some point, prices will have to move."

Over the past few decades, bidding philosophy has changed. Methods have evolved and improved, and expert partnerships reach good contracts more often -- if given a free run in the auction.
 So an emphasis on obstructing the opponents' auction has taken hold. There is no denying that preempts work. Still, your preempt may impel your opponents to bid with all the more vigor, push them into an unlikely contract -- and help them make it.
 In today's deal, North lacked the values to act over West's preempt. But when South backed in with four diamonds, North lifted to six. West led the king of clubs, and South took the ace.
 With no clues from the auction, South might have cashed the K-A of diamonds, then finessed in spades to try for a club discard. But after West's preempt, South's approach was different -- and successful. He led a trump to the king and trump to his jack, playing West for a singleton (especially since West might have led a major-suit singleton if he'd held one). After taking the ace of trumps, South led the nine of spades and let it ride.

Implanted infusion pumps are small medical device intended for steady dose administration of drugs. Implantable pumps consist of a reservoir that is placed subcutaneously which is connected through a catheter into the intrathecal space of the pump. The pump directs liquid medicine through a thin flexible tube or a catheter to a target part of the body. They are typically labeled for dosages, specific drugs, and routes of administration that generally require a high level of monitoring. Implantable infusion pumps are designed to offer long term drug infusion through the intravenous, subcutaneous, or intra-arterial route of drug administration. The advantages of these pumps are, the convenience of drug administration, reduction, or elimination drug overdosing, the drug is delivered locally or to a systemic circulation with minimal interference of metabolic or biological barriers and flexibility.

At A&M, Ron became a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, Army ROTC, Sword and Scabbard, the cheerleading team, and was the school handball champion. During the summers from 1949 and 1953, he worked for Midwestern Pipeline Constructors as a skid hustler, hoosier pole man, swamper and a helper to put himself through college, where he earned a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering.
 After college, Ron served in the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps for two years in Germany and became maintenance officer for all battalions of 280mm atomic cannons stationed in Europe.
 Upon discharge, Ron resumed his education at the University of Oklahoma, earning a Master's Degree in Business and Finance in 1957. Ten years were spent as an engineer for Shell Oil Company, specializing in equipment design and sales for structural resins and corrosion coatings in New Jersey, Atlanta, and Houston. In 1967, Ron founded Commercial Resins Company and returned to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to raise his five sons. He pioneered a series of novel machines and received a number of U.S. patents including specialized spray guns, the first field coating machines to employ induction heating, robotics for internal pipeline inspection and a fully portable coating plant in shipping containers among others.
 The '70s and '80s saw his small company grow internationally to include engineering of pipe coating facilities in the U.S., Saudi Arabia, the U.K. with British Gas, South Africa, Columbia, Mexico and Australia, and offices in Tulsa; Houston; Napa; Monterrey, Mexico; and Bedford, England. Thirty years after his first summer job for Midwestern, Ron bought the company and folded their coating, double-jointing and welding activities into Commercial Resins.

HARRISBURG, Neb. (AP) — Linda Barrett, a second generation Banner County school bus driver, smiled and laughed this week while she told stories of her time spent behind the wheel, specifically driving the football team to and from a number of games in the past. “During that time, the team didn’t have a manager so I became the new ‘water boy’ for the kids. I’d fill up the water bottles and hand them to the players when they came out of the game and the first thing the boys would say is ‘Thank you Linda.’ I would have to keep telling them to stop saying thank you and just to focus on the game.” Barrett will retire in May after spending the last 43 years supporting small town kids and families, in big ways. The Scottsbluff Star Herald reports she spent the last four decades traveling thousands of miles down dirt roads, picking up kids in the midst of snow blizzards and sunny days. “In 1988, we left school here and it was pretty much a blizzard. Two of the buses didn’t get home and my bus was one of them, and during that time, it ended up that I was away from home for 52 hours. I had 13 kids with me and we had to stay at an elderly lady’s house for two nights, and I was a little nervous about how the kids would behave but they were so great when we were there.” Not only did she take on the role of a school bus driver, but has also consistently been a key supporter and sponsor for the school’s activities. “I was a student council sponsor for years and years, and that was a fun thing to do. I just love FFA, so I enjoy to do that too. I subbed in just about anything you can do here. I have worked in the kitchen, subbed for the secretary, subbed in classrooms for a few hours when they needed me. I was the pep club sponsor and I have spent lots...

We have been here before. In 1968, I was a federal agent on assignment in Washington, D.C., at a time when it appeared the fabric of our nation was being shredded. Our nation’s capital, along with the rest of the nation, was enmeshed in Vietnam war protests, the anguish and violence following the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King, the Poor People’s March, the murder of Bobby Kennedy along with economic and social upheaval. Here I experienced firsthand the nature and significance of activism in a democratic society.
 More than half a century later we have seen some progress even though, in the clutches of a deadly virus, we are still struggling with the same issues of economic, social and racial injustice.
 In our current divided situation, words matter. Freedom, justice, love, peace, peaceful coexistence are words of substance and meaning. These words feel good. They are calming, healing, dignified and, most important, they are words to live by and to provoke action.
 Acting in pursuit of freedom, justice and peace is vital if these words are to have meaning. However, actions require us to choose a side and take a stand. The tension between progressive and conservative ideology should become irrelevant when people’s lives are at risk. So, how do we choose sides, survive a pandemic and keep the peace at the same time?
 To be an activist and meet this challenge requires you to be informed and to understand the cause you support. In this age of intense social and commercial media, one must exert extra effort to separate truth from fiction and facts from propaganda. The success of activism in any arena depends on a combination of informing oneself, speaking out, educating the public and taking direct action.

Nell’ultima settimana e cominciato, all’ombra del Covid, quel gioco di nascondino al buio in cui nessuno sembra disposto a fare la prima mossa. Anzi, tutti si schermiscono dicendo che la Capitale e ingovernabile con un buco di bilancio di 13 miliardi di euro. Per ripensare Roma, dopo i tanti inutili tentativi della destra e della sinistra e con la strenua opposizione di sindacati, lobby e piccoli appaltatori, si potrebbe partire facendo cassa con la vendita di Acea e Atac. La prima, che distribuisce acqua, gas ed energia a Roma, dopo la cura Donnarumma ha buoni risultati sia sul piano aziendale che in borsa e la vendita del 51%, o di una quota inferiore, della partecipazione del Comune, magari incorporando anche Ama, l’azienda dei rifiuti, potrebbe portare nelle casse dell’Urbe fino a un miliardo di euro. Piu complicata la situazione di Atac, l’azienda dei trasporti che va completamente ristrutturata e che potrebbe diventare una partita da giocare con Trenitalia. A schermirsi con piu convinzione degli altri, la grande favorita per la corsa al Campidoglio, la romanissima Giorgia Meloni, l’unica capace di battere il candidato della sinistra. Ma, forte dei sondaggi in crescita, si e ormai convinta che l’unico Palazzo a lei congeniale e Chigi.

SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- Outrage is spreading over a shooting of a black man that led to murder charges more than two months later against a white father and son, but "all that matters is what the facts tell us," Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vic Reynolds said Friday.
   
 And once the GBI was brought into the case, "we came up fairly quickly with the solid belief that there's sufficient cause to charge them with felony murder and aggravated assault," Reynolds said at a news conference.
   
 The investigation continues now that Gregory and Travis McMichael have been booked into the Glynn County Jail in the Feb. 23 shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, and Reynolds said "every stone will be uncovered."
   
 But in response to a question about racial intent in the shooting, Reynolds said "there is no hate crime in Georgia. There isn't. It is one of four or five states that doesn't have one."
   
 The McMichaels told police they pursued Arbery, with another person recording them on video, after spotting him running in their neighborhood. The father and son said they thought he matched the appearance of a burglary suspect recorded on a surveillance camera.
   
 Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, has said she thinks her son, a former football player, was just jogging in the Satilla Shores neighborhood before he was killed on a Sunday afternoon.
   
 National outrage over the case swelled this week after the cellphone video was leaked and shared on social media.
   
 Those close to Arbery celebrated the news but also expressed frustration at the long wait.
   
 "This should have occurred the day it happened," said Akeem Baker, one of Arbery's close friends in Brunswick. "There's no way without the video this would have occurred. I'm just glad the light's shining very bright on this situation."
   
 Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the slain man's father, Marcus Arbery, said it's outrageous it took so long for arrests to be made.
   
 "This is the first step to justice," Crump said in a statement. "This murderous father and son duo took the law into their own hands. It's a travesty of justice that they enjoyed their freedom for 74 days after taking the life of a young black man who was simply jogging."
   
 The GBI announced the arrests the day after it began its own investigation at the request of an outside prosecutor. The felony murder charges against Gregory McMichael, 64, and Travis McMichael, 34, mean that a victim was killed during the commission of an underlying felony, in this case aggravated assault. The charge doesn't require intent to kill.
   
 A GBI news release said the McMichaels "confronted Arbery with two firearms. During the encounter, Travis McMichael shot and killed Arbery."
   
 Reynolds said he didn't know whether the McMichaels had an attorney who could comment.
   
 Gregory McMichael served as an investigator for Glynn County District Attorney Jackie Johnson before retiring last year. The connection caused Johnson to recuse herself from the case.
   
 At a news conference in Atlanta before the arrests were announced Thursday, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters he was confident state investigators would "find the truth."
   
 "Earlier this week, I watched the video depicting Mr. Arbery's last moments alive," Kemp said. "I can tell you it's absolutely horrific, and Georgians deserve answers."
   
 Gregory McMichael told police he suspected the runner was the same man filmed by a security camera committing a break-in. He and his grown son, Travis McMichael, grabbed guns and began a pursuit in a pickup truck.
   
 The video shows a black man running at a jogging pace. The truck is stopped in the road ahead of him, with one of the white men standing in the pickup's bed and the other beside the open driver's side door.
   
 The runner attempts to pass the pickup on the passenger side, moving just beyond the truck, briefly outside the camera's view. A gunshot sounds, and the video shows the runner grappling with a man over what appears to be a shotgun or rifle. A second shot can be heard, and the runner can be seen punching the man. A third shot is fired at point-blank range. The runner staggers a few feet and falls face down.
   
 Brunswick defense attorney Alan Tucker identified himself Thursday as the person who shared the video with the radio station. He did not say how he obtained it. In a statement, Tucker said he wasn't representing anyone involved. He said he shared the video "because my community was being ripped apart by erroneous accusations and assumptions."
   
 Tucker did not immediately respond to a phone message or an email.
   
 The outcry over the killing reached the White House, where President Donald Trump offered condolences to Arbery's family. He spoke again about the case Friday morning in an interview on Fox News Channel, saying "I saw the tape and it's very, very disturbing."
   
 "It's a heartbreak. ... Very rough, rough stuff," Trump added. "Justice getting done is what solves that problem. It's in the hands of the governor and I'm sure he'll do the right thing."
   
 Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden called Arbery's death a "murder." During an online roundtable Thursday, Biden said the video shows Arbery "lynched before our very eyes."
   
 The outside prosecutor now overseeing the case, Tom Durden, had said Monday that he wanted a grand jury to decide whether charges are warranted. Georgia courts are still largely closed because of the coronavirus.

Well-hidden from casual view, Oak Vistas is a cozy enclave of 69 single-family residences east of Honore Avenue. Sandwiched between Colonial Oaks to the south and west and the Heron East assisted living facility on Cattlemen Road, it offers quiet seclusion and privacy.
   
 "It's a neighborhood within a neighborhood," said Carol Burke, an agent with White Sands Realty.
   
 Getting there requires taking one of two circuitous routes. The more direct approach from Cattlemen Road runs west to the end of Hagerman Road with a left turn onto Old Trenton Lane to the entrance of the neighborhood. The other winds through Colonial Oaks from Honore Avenue, but if you don't know the way, you're likely to get lost among the many twists and turns.
   
 A ring road, Aaron Court surrounds a small, scenic pond with scenic views and an abundance of birdlife. Two short, offshoot lanes end in cul de sacs.
   
 "I like that you don't have a cut-through, so it's safe for kids to play outside and ride their bikes," said Burke. "It's very walkable, with sidewalks on both sides of the streets, which is great or dog owners who don't want to take their pets in the streets."
   
 Starting in 2005, Maglich Homes, a custom builder in Sarasota, put up a dozen or so houses before the real estate recession put an end to development. In 2010, D. R. Horton took over and finished out the neighborhood over the next five years.
   
 The Fort Worth, Texas based company kept the attractive, Mediterranean-style look in its one-and two-story models. Barrel tiles cover the front porch entrances and two-car garage overhangs, as well as the roofs. Stucco facades with black metal wall sconces complete the old-country feel. Inside, spacious floor plans and tall ceilings provide space, luxury and comfort. The kitchens come equipped with granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances.
   
 Homeowners association fees of $850 per year cover upkeep of the sidewalks, ponds and common areas, and lawn irrigation with reclaimed water.
   
 Most of the three-, four-, and five-bedroom homes lie on the central pond and the two side lakes on the western border of the community. A few have covered lanais and private swimming pools in their backyards.
   
 Burke's listing at 5797 Aaron Court has the feel of a Tuscan villa with bright yellow walls and white trim. The front entrance and first floor windows have fluted column ornamentation on the sides. A pretty balcony with a balustrade overlooks the three royal palm trees in the front yard and the paver driveway leading up to the 2-car garage. An adjacent gazebo adds to the charm
   
 Built in 2007, the two-story house has five bedrooms, three baths and 2,907 square feet of living space. "It was done by Maglich for their family use, so there is extra custom woodwork, columns and niches, crown molding and recessed lighting throughout," said Burke.
   
 Most residents of Oak Vistas live there year-round and include retirees and working professionals. "The four- and five-bedroom homes attract families with children," Burke said.
   
 Two of the district schools -- Brentwood Elementary and McIntosh Middle -- are within a two-mile radius. The third, Sarasota High, is only five miles away.
   
 Although well tucked away, Oak Vistas enjoys proximity to a variety of amenities, including easy access to I-75 -- via the Bee Ridge exchange. Grocery stores, big box stores, other shopping venues, and restaurants Cattlemen, Bee Ridge and Fruitville Roads are within convenient driving distance. UTC and Benderson Park are a quick 10-minute jog to the north. Doctor's Hospital is only five minutes away.
   
 "It's a great location," said Burke.
   
 Currently, there are three homes on the market in Oak Vistas, ranging in price from $334,900 to $430,000.

If those indicators begin to spike, he said, Long Beach “could roll back some of these measures” it’s implementing to allow businesses to reopen.

LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — To bring the coronavirus under heel, particularly as the measures that effectively closed Nebraska are lifted, public health agencies across the state will use a tried and true tool used for decades to help control infectious disease outbreaks. Contact tracing, a kind of connect-the-dots for tracking how a disease spreads in a community, has been deployed to manage everything from outbreaks of sexually transmitted diseases to a recent flare up of the measles in New York. The goal is to identify positive cases in the population, ask those individuals to isolate at home or elsewhere, and to identify any one else they may have come into contact with since becoming infected, according to the Lincoln Journal Star. That’s not necessarily easy, said Dr. Crystal Watson of the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, particularly when efforts to perform more tests are showing the virus continues to spread quickly throughout a population. Nationally, estimates for the number of contact tracers needed in the ongoing response range between 100,000 to as many as 300,000, costing billions of dollars to deploy. But it’s a tool states will want to have in place before this fall, Watson said, when infectious disease experts anticipate a resurgence of coronavirus cases across the country. “This capacity is really needed to break those chains of transmission,” Watson said at a recent SciLine briefing on contact tracing for reporters. “But more importantly, at a population level, it’s to manage this epidemic on an ongoing, low level in different places around the country.” Contact tracing efforts are already in place in several communities across the state, including Lincoln, which has seen its total cases rise by 148% this week...

Robert "Bob" Newkirk, age 93, passed into new life after a brief illness on May 3, 2020. He was a Tulsan most of his life, coming here in 1957.
 Bob was born March 25, 1927 in Stuttgart, AR, the second child of Vera Robnolt Newkirk and Arnold Leroy Newkirk. He spent his childhood there but left at age 18 to join the Navy in 1945. He served his country in the Navy as a Radar Operator, Seaman First Class, on the USS Delta in China and Japan at the end of World War II. He acquired tuberculosis during his military service and spent four years in a quarantine hospital in Booneville, AR, upon his return. After his recovery, he was able to attend the University of Arkansas using his GI Bill and graduated in 1955 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration.

PORTSMOUTH - New Hampshire Theatre Project announces the next session of their riotous Couch to Mic five-week improvisational comedy training and performance class. This workshop begins on Tuesday, May 12 and runs from 7 to 8:30 p.m. for five consecutive weeks culminating in an online performance on the NHTP YouTube Channel. Couch to Mic is taught by NHTP Company Artist Stephanie Lazenby who maintains the same high standard of writing and performance instruction, adapted to an online setting. For more details, visit, www.nhtheatreproject.org.
   
 "When all of THIS started I thought a lot about performance and comedy." says Stephanie Lazenby, "I never questioned if comedy was okay or necessary. We need comedy. We need to laugh, feel good and to connect with other people - but I did question the HOW. How does stand-up, or any type of live comedy performance - which depends on a live audience - translate to an online setting? Couch to Mic was designed to get you off of your couch, meeting other people and into a theatre in front of a live audience. How does that translate, when we are all on our couch?"
   
 With one online session of Couch to Mic completed, we know that translating comedy online works. Mo Conley, who has taken class online says, "I definitely still felt the same camaraderie with the class, which is a very important part of Couch to Mic. The feedback we give each other is fantastic. It felt like a safe environment to express ourselves, just like the in-person environment." Leslie Pasternack, a performer and owner of Lemon Punch Theatre Lab agrees, "Taking Couch to Mic online was fascinating and extremely fun! I have taken the class in person and on Zoom and Stephanie Lazenby always keeps the mood upbeat and gives us really useful feedback as we shape our material. I highly recommend this class for anyone looking to have fun, connect with a group of talented people, and take their creativity to the next level."
   
 There are a few exciting advantages in Couch to Mic being online. Stephanie says, "Now, participants aren't limited to living in the Seacoast, so really you can live anywhere and take the class. Plus, the performance is uploaded onto NHTP's YouTube channel, which allows a wider audience for the show. Plus, NHTP Company Artist CJ Lewis does an incredible job in editing the show."
   
 Couch to Mic students participate via Zoom on either a computer or smartphone. Instruction is given through this method, and students have the same opportunity to introduce themselves, explore their stories, and learn performance skills.
   
 "This program was intentionally designed for anyone interested in exploring stand-up comedy and we know those skills gained translate to a number of other settings. For example, humor and laughter can be so helpful to resolving conflict and even healing." explains Catherine Stewart, NHTP Artistic Director. New Hampshire Theatre Project continues its mission of sparking conversation, connecting individuals and strengthening community through programs like, Couch To Mic.

But there is little hope that the Chinese government will relax its stance toward the server lock or quickly green light the sale of Animal Crossing in China, as the game has become a political flash point after Hong Kong democracy activist Wong used it to protest against Beijing's rule over the Chinese territory.
 Last month, Wong posted a screenshot of his island on Twitter decorated with a banner saying: "Free Hong Kong, revolution now." Shortly after that, cartridges of Animal Crossing and related themed merchandise were pulled off China's grey market e-commerce platforms.
 Mainland gamers now have to look for the game using code names such as "macho man picking tree branch" and "macho man fishing bass" to find vendors willing to deal privately, and it has fueled further frustration among the majority, who say they usually just carry out mundane, nonpolitical activities like dressing up their cartoon avatars or grow vegetables.
 "If it were a very violent game that had been banned internationally, I'd understand," Zhao said.
 Still, some Chinese gamers have reacted to Wong's posts by decorating their island with slogans such as "one country, two systems, unite China," in reference to Beijing's policy toward Taiwan and Hong Kong.
 Wong has since shared pictures of his island showing portraits of President Xi and the World Health Organization's head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a mock funeral with a sign saying "Wuhan pneumonia."
 "We try our best to turn an island to be a protest site," Wong said.

In order for 5G to work effectively, wireless network infrastructure has to change to support 5G tech. This include rejigging base stations with something called “Massive MIMO,” or massive multiple-in, multiple-out architecture. The science here is fairly complex, but in a nutshell, Massive MIMO involves putting a bunch of extra, 5G-enabled RF antennas on each base station to enable better wireless performance without maxing out individual antenna power (faster speeds with more network density).

Speaking on a "Virtual Sports Report” conducted via Zoom on Thursday by the Greater Columbus Sports Commission, Memorial Tournament director Dan Sullivan indicated a limited number of fans will be allowed on the course but movements would be restricted and monitored.
 Other protocols, according the Golf Digest report, include limiting ticket sales, curtailing capacity in the clubhouse and public gathering structures, elimination of all grandstands, supplying face coverings for staff and volunteers and taking the temperature of everyone who enters the grounds.
 The sale of draft beer and fountain drinks will be prohibited while all transactions will be restricted to credit cards.
 "At any time we can know around the golf course how many people are collecting in a certain area,” said Sullivan.
 "We're going to use that technology to make sure that we're protecting everyone around us, protecting the folks that are inside those various venues and make sure that we're monitoring effectively and producing a tournament that everyone can be comfortable with."
 The RFID technology has been used the last four years at the Memorial to monitor entrances and exits and identify choke points at Muirfield Village Golf Club, but will play a much more important role at this year's event.
 The PGA Tour released a revised schedule in April. It outlined that the first four events will be played without spectators, starting with the June 11-14 Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas.
 In addition to the Charles Schwab, the other tournaments slated to be held without fans are the RBC Heritage (June 18-21) in Hilton Head, South Carolina; the Travelers Championship (June 25-28) in Cromwell, Connecticut; and the Rocket Mortgage Classic (July 2-5) in Detroit.
 The first tournament tentatively preparing for spectators is the July 9-12 John Deere Classic in Silvis, Illinois, followed by the Memorial.
 "It’s a common misconception based on the initial news release that the first four events are not having fans … but it never really said our event is going to have fans,” John Deere tournament director Clair Peterson told Golf Digest.
 "We're trying to work through all of the obvious considerations, which includes all of the Illinois restrictions.
 "Who knows? Memorial could be the first event with fans if we do not have them, but they’re in the exact same position of not knowing what will be permissible. But they have to make every preparation possible, as we are."
