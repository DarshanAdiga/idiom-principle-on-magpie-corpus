It has been 20 years since Texas could claim a day where there were no fatalities on our roads. This Nov. 7, Texas marked 20 years of daily deaths on our roadways with more than 70,000 people killed since 2000. According to the Texas Department of Transportation every day in Texas nearly 10 people are killed in traffic crashes with the leading causes of these deadly crashes continuing to be failure to stay in one lane, alcohol, speed and distracted driving.
 TxDOT is promoting the “End the Streak” campaign to help end motor vehicle fatalities in Texas. The road to ending the streak is not impossible. In Texas there were 23 counties with zero fatalities in 2019.
 The pandemic has taught us all about the importance of shared responsibility. Ending this streak of needless tragedy on Texas roadways is also a shared responsibility. While it is considered socially unacceptable to drink and drive and most people would think twice about drinking and driving or riding with a drunk driver, riding with a driver who is speeding, not buckled up, using their phone while driving or driving in any reckless manner has not reached the threshold of being socially unacceptable yet. Drivers and passengers can change that by taking responsibility for each other’s safe driving.
 What if for one day everyone took responsibility for themselves and their friends and there were no drunk drivers on our roads? And there was not one person driving somewhere to drink without a plan for a sober ride home — and no underage drunk drivers were to be found anywhere.
 What if everyone made sure that the driver and all passengers in the vehicle were buckled up? And, that all children were riding in the correct car seat for their age, weight and height and the seat was installed correctly.
 What if everyone took responsibility to make sure that no driver was speeding down the road, but was instead driving within the speed limit, including slowing down for construction and emergency vehicles, and driving more slowly and cautiously during bad weather conditions?

Things appear much more serious with the two strongest parties PML(N) and PPP having set aside their differences for the moment and agreed upon a compromise leader in Maulana Fazlur Rehman.

The PDM proposes to launch a mass protest campaign comprising public gatherings, political rallies, no-confidence motions, en masse resignations from assemblies and, finally, a long march in January that will culminate in a sit-in in Islamabad until their demands are met. Sticking together long enough to see it through will be a major challenge.

Celebrating Biden's presidential election win
   
 America stood up and voted. This was not really about a fight between Democrats and Republicans; it was people of both parties standing up against Trump.
   
 The Republicans made the mistake of supporting a sick man even though they knew Trump needs serious help.
   
 This election indicates that not all Republicans voted Trump and should be a wake-up call for the party and their future.
   
 President-elect Joe Biden has shown dignity, courage and the wisdom of a true leader. We are in good hands.

 Troubled by Democrats' approach to flawed ballots
   
 It was bit disconcerting, if not disturbing, to read in a story published Nov. 7 headlined "Advocates race to find voters to correct flawed ballots" that a Democratic activist gave "instructions and a pep talk" proclaiming "never has it ever been more true than now that every vote counts."
   
 Later in the piece two of those Democratic activists admittedly decided to "skip" a house where an SUV touted a "Blue Lives Matter" sticker because "The sticker suggested the home could be occupied by someone who backed President Donald Trump, a Republican." If this isn't telling I don't know what is.
   
 It would be interesting to know what was known about these ballots needing correction and just who was handling them. More intriguing would be to know what was said behind closed doors about the content and instructions for this "pep talk."

Epidemiologists still don’t wholeheartedly agree. The questions in most people’s minds when they hear of an infection are: Were there underlying factors? Did the person have pulmonary issues? How old were they? And last but not least, did they wear a mask? Those inquiries are followed by a self-check if we’ve compromised any of the protocol.
 After all, those are the facts drilled into us about this unforeseen enemy by sought out expert advice. We may never know the full aspects of how this thing travels.
 One thing we know is that it affects people in different ways. Some people are barely affected and some cases have extreme results. I know people that have had both results with no rhyme or reason as to how they became infected. That’s what puts people on edge.
 My wife had a cousin who was diagnosed with the virus on a Saturday and passed away by Tuesday. Then, by the same token, I know several people who have tested positive who haven’t even had a sniffle. I admit, every time my throat feels scratchy, I feel a sneeze coming on, I cough or see anyone else do any of the aforesaid actions, COVID-19 comes to mind. Am I getting it? Does that person who coughed have it?
 There is talk about herd immunity. I’m not a fan of the term, it makes me think of cattle warding off mad cow disease.
 With a U.S. president yet to be certified, we look to the future to see what could be coming down the pike as far as continued handling of the virus. Opinions of what protocols will be put in place are as split on that prediction as they are with how we should go about our daily lives.

BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - LSU football player Koy Moore retained a group of civil rights attorneys after being “violated” by Baton Rouge police officers.In a prepared statement, the attorneys claim Moore was with Alabama freshman wide receiver Traeshon Holden in Baton Rouge Sunday, Nov. 8.That same day, officers were sent to a parking garage at 740 W Chimes St. just before 2 a.m. after being called by a security guard, Baton Rouge Police Department (BRPD) records say. The guard told dispatchers about 200 people gathered for a party with loud music, according to those records.Once at the scene the officers were unable to find anything described by the security guard, the report says.But that’s where the report ends. It makes no mention of the alleged encounter with Moore and Holden.According to the attorneys, the events excluded from the report began with Moore and Holden being approached by the officers as they were attempting to get food.Immediately the officers pointed guns at the athletes, the attorneys wrote.From there the situation grew more hostile. The officers allegedly questioned the two about weapons, snatched Moore’s phone as he attempted to record the encounter, and attempted to physically search Moore by unzipping his pants at one point, the attorneys allege.“Things went from zero to 100 real quick,” said attorney Ron Haley. “That’s not fair to these kids. But it’s also not fair to the next set of officers that may have an interaction with them because now they have a preconceived notion as to this thing may go bad and that may cause them to react in a more negative way the next time they have that interaction.”Moore and one attorney were able to watch body camera footage captured of the incident.BRPD refuses to release copies of that footage to the public.There is a “critical incident” policy used by the department to release body camera footage of controversial and violent interactions in the past, but BRPD officials maintain this incident falls outside the scope of that policy.“We should always err on the side of transparency. A transparent police department is a better police department,” said Haley in response. “This may not come to a critical incident because a gun wasn’t fired [and] somebody wasn’t killed or maimed. But, it could have went that way.”The attorneys have filed a request for records, setting up a potential court fight where a judge would get to decide if the video should be released under Louisiana law.They argue sharing the video would clear the damage done to the student-athletes' reputations.“My client has a future. My client is hopeful to have a profession after college, whether that profession is in the NFL or whatever academic lane that he chooses to be in. And the fact that now he has been thrust into the spotlight for something not positive, that’s impactful to him from already being in the public eye to now being in the public eye for something else,” said Haley. “He did not ask for this.”Attorney Ryan Thompson said it was unclear if Holden retained an attorney.Attempts to contact Alabama’s athletics officials were not returned.Contrary to Moore sharing a detailed post about the incident, Holden’s only mention of the interaction was shared via his Twitter account.In a tweet, Holden says officers “didn’t care” as the two explained they were athletes and innocent.Moore said that’s the only reason the encounter didn’t go further.“That’s troubling that you had to put an additional status. That it’s not enough to be an American for you to be treated equally. That somehow you have to be special. You have to be special to get basic decency,” said Haley. “You have to be special to warrant a decent interaction, in this case, with these officers. That you have to have the status of a title, and at that point you get respect. It’s not enough that you’re a citizen.”The officers involved in the incident have been placed on paid administrative leave as an internal investigation continues.“We appreciate Mr. Moore bringing this incident to our attention,” BRPD Chief Paul said in a statement. “As in every case, we will be collecting all available evidence and conducting interviews. Accountability and transparency are critical in building trust with the community. I pledge a thorough investigation into this complaint.”East Baton Rouge Parish Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome also released a statement concerning the incident.“My office has been made aware of a situation concerning BRPD and an LSU student. Upon notification, I have been in contact with Chief Paul, who has assured me his department is thoroughly investigating this matter and he has been in touch with the student,” said Broome. “We take these allegations seriously and will await the findings of the investigation. We will get to the bottom of this situation and keep the lines of communication open with the community.”Haley says the next steps are figuring out if proper protocol was followed by the officers, figuring out if policy changes could be made at BRPD, and understanding why officers responding to a party had their guns drawn.“When we talk about escalation and de-escalation this could have been one of those tragedies," said Haley. “And I’m so happy that it’s not one of those tragedies.”Click here to report a typo.Copyright 2020 WAFB.

 “While we are clearly a nation divided, we sincerely hope that American voters can reach across the table and celebrate democracy--and move forward as a nation,” said Sepanta Bagherpour, Chief Brand Officer of Nando’s U.S. operations. “As a first step, come together over a meal and let’s begin to put ‘United’ back in the United States. Nando’s will throw in the chicken.”
 Customers who come in between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Tuesday will receive a quarter chicken, on the house.
 The Nando’s offer is good for dine-in or takeout at all Nando’s restaurants in Virginia and Maryland.
 Nando's has 10 restaurants in Northern Virginia, including Ashburn, Springfield, Alexandria, Woodbridge, Gainesville, Reston and several locations in Arlington.
 Customers can choose from a chicken leg or chicken breast and the offer is available while supplies last.
 During the election cycle, Nando’s put voter registration on its menu. Literally. Customers ordered voter-registration forms directly from the menu at every Nando’s in the US, and took home more than 200,000 registration applications and voter-resource flyers, showing prospective voters how to quickly update their voter-registration status online.

Amanza Smith is defending co-star Crishell Stause amid rumors that the _Selling Sunset_ star was having an affair with her _Dancing With the Stars_ partner, Gleb Savchenko. Just days after the pair was eliminated from the ABC dance floor, the pro dancer split from wife Elena Samodanova, who accused her husband of 14 years of multiple affairs and a "recent inappropriate relationship." While eyes turned to Stause as the alleged mystery lady, the former soap opera star and Savchenko have insisted their relationship is purely platonic.
 Smith is standing behind Stause 100 percent, she said in an interview on FUBAR Radio Thursday. "Poor Chrishell," the interior designer said. "She was like, 'I went through a very public divorce [with _This Is Us_ star Justin Hartley]. Like, the last thing she would ever do is add to somebody's infidelity if that's what was going on.' But that's just how it goes when you are in the spotlight, but I think she's pretty pissed off about it. … It sounds like maybe the wife is using this as, like, a cheap PR stunt."
 Just a day after Savchenko announced he and his wife were splitting up, Samodanova told _PEOPLE_ the reason for the breakup was "ongoing infidelity" on his part. "No wife should ever stand by and watch while another woman gifts her husband expensive presents, lures him out to dinners and seduces him at every turn," Samodanova said at the time. "Last night was the final straw, and I can no longer turn my head the other way. My trust in Gleb is irrevocably broken and it is time that I walk away and begin to heal so I can be the best version of myself for my girls."
 Stause came out soon after to deny she had any role in the split, citing her public divorce from Hartley, which played out on TV after he filed in November 2019. "I am so saddened about the news of Gleb and Elena's split," Stause wrote in an Instagram Story. "It is unfortunate that this has caused rumors to swirl about my personal life. Having gone through a public split myself, I would not wish this on anyone."
 She added, "As you can imagine, the countless hours of training and dance rehearsals has created a strong supportive friendship, but nothing more. I wish nothing but the best for both Gleb and Elena during this unfortunate time."

Tom Brady is not used to seeing tropical storms as he didn't have to deal with them when he was with the New England Patriots. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback talked to reporters on Thursday and revealed that he lost his dock and two jet skis after Tropical Storm Eta hit the area. He was surprised to see how much of an impact the storm made.
 "The hurricane, that was a trip last night for me," Brady said as reported by _TMZ_. "I had a dock and it broke, floated away. I had these jet skis on, I saw those things sitting in the middle of the bay and I was going, 'Wow, that's pretty surreal' and I was kinda laughing. 'Well, you'll get the jet skis back.'" Brady went on to say he was surprised to see how fast the storm moved through the community.
 "It happened pretty quick, I thought you had time to prepare for these things but apparently you don't, They're just kinda on you and then you just gotta deal with it so we pushed the schedule back today," he said. "Fortunate everyone made it safe and sound. Good lesson learned for someone who's been in the northeast for a long time."
 Brady was able to retrieve his jet skis. However, the focus for him is getting back on track on the football field as the Buccaneers are coming off a 38-3 loss to the New Orleans Saints. Brady had one of the worst performances of his career, throwing three interceptions and recording a 40.4 passer rating.

 "It's about playing better and execution, Brady said after the game on Sunday night as reported by Fox News. "When you play good teams, there's little margin of error. They've been a great team for a long time. They've got a lot of good players. If we're going to beat them, we're going to have to play a lot better than we played tonight."
 The Bucs are now 6-3 on the year and would make the playoffs if it started today. However, the loss put them behind the Saints for the lead in the NFC South. So far this season, Brady has completed 65.3% of his passes and has thrown for 2,398 yards, 20 touchdowns and seven interceptions with a passer rating of 96.2.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — One of the first cruise ships to ply through Caribbean waters since the pandemic began ended its trip early after at least five passengers tested positive for COVID-19, officials said Thursday.The SeaDream I is carrying 66 crew and more than 50 passengers, with the majority of passengers hailing from the U.S., according to Sue Bryant, who is aboard the ship and is a cruise editor for The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain.She told The Associated Press that one passenger became sick on Wednesday and forced the ship to turn back to Barbados, where it had departed from on Saturday. However, the ship had yet to dock in Barbados as local authorities tested those on board. The captain announced that at least five passengers have tested positive, Bryant said.The incident marked the first time SeaDream had resumed its West Indies voyages since the pandemic, with the ship originally scheduled to return to Barbados on Saturday, according to an online itinerary. The ship had made several stops in St. Vincent and the Grenadines before turning back.The Norway-based SeaDream Yacht Club, the ship’s parent company, wouldn’t say how many passengers tested positive in the initial round of testing.Bryant said passengers were required to have a negative PCR test to enter Barbados and underwent another test on the dock administered by the ship’s doctor.“We all felt very safe,” she said, adding that the ship had been implementing strict hygiene protocols. “Yet somehow, COVID appears to have got on board.”SeaDream said the ship’s medical staff has tested all crew members and that all tested negative. The company also said it is currently re-testing all guests, noting they’re all under quarantine along with non-essential crew members.“We are working closely with local health and government authorities to resolve this situation in the best possible way,” SeaDream said. “Our main priority is the health and safety of our crew, guests, and the communities we visit.”Government officials in Barbados did not return messages for comment.Waters around the Caribbean have been largely bereft of cruise ships this year, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suspending cruise ship operations at U.S. ports in mid-March. The no-sail order expired on Oct. 31.Last week, the Cruise Lines International Association, which represents 95% of global ocean-growing cruise capacity, said its members were voluntarily suspending cruise operations in the U.S. through Dec. 31.SeaDream was among the first cruise lines to resume service in Europe. In August, the company reported that an asymptomatic passenger had tested positive for the coronavirus after disembarking from SeaDream I in Denmark. All other passengers and crew tested negative, the company said.___AP business writer Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit, Michigan, contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

"Mank" has the makings of an Oscar contender, and not just because of Hollywood's traditional love for movies about itself. With Gary Oldman as the alcoholic, self-destructive writer of "Citizen Kane," director David Fincher has made a near-great movie about what's in the argument as the greatest of all time.
 Shot in black and white to breathtakingly evoke the 1930s, the film cleverly adopts a time-hopping format intended to approximate the structure of the movie at its core. In the eye of the storm sits Oldman's Herman J. Mankiewicz, a gifted writer and one-time unofficial court jester at the California castle constructed by media titan William Randolph Hearst ("Game of Thrones'" Charles Dance) to entertain his guests.
 The movie finds a recuperating Mankiewicz hidden away in the middle of nowhere, on a tight deadline to finish the "Kane" script for 20-something auteur Orson Welles (Tom Burke, simply uncanny in capturing his voice and manner). He dictates the script, working with a secretary (Lily Collins) and live-in nurse (Monika Gossman) while fighting an ongoing battle with booze.

  The special had initially been slated to debut in May alongside the launch of WarnerMedia's new streaming service HBO Max. It was later revealed, however, that the special had been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, which forced production on many series and films to grind to a halt. In March, _Deadline_ confirmed that the special would delay filming, reporting that production would be pushed back until sometime in May, a date that was again pushed back. In July, Schwimmer told Jimmy Fallon that the hope was to begin production in August, though that date, too, was pushed back.

  "Unfortunately it's very sad that we had to move it again. It was, 'How do we do this with live audiences?' This is not a safe time. Period. That's the bottom line.

  The special will mark the first time the entire cast has reunited on the screen since the show came to an end in 2004. First premiering in 1994, _Friends_ chronicled the lives of six 20-something New Yorkers as they navigated through their personal and professional lives. It aired for 10 seasons, with all 236 episodes of the series currently available for streaming on HBO Max.

But all are expected to be in contention when MK Dons visit the Stadium of Light.
 Parkinson said: "We picked a team for the FA Cup game that we felt should have won the game, but a focus for me in the week was the players who had been ruled out [with injury] and one or two who needed a break.
 "My aim was to get through this week with as many of our key senior players available for this weekend as possible.
 "Josh, Lynden, Denver and Luke have all trained."
 Jordan Willis has sat out recent games with an ongoing knee injury but he played the full 90 minutes of the midweek EFL Trophy game at Fleetwood Town and could play tomorrow, giving Parkinson an extra option in central defence at a time when Conor McLaughlin and Tom Flanagan are both away on international duty with Northern Ireland.
 "Jordan is ready [to start]," he said.
 "He has patella tendonitis which is quite a difficult problem to explain to people who haven't had it.
 "It is something which just needs to be managed, and Jordan has managed it.
 "He got to this stage last year, after the Scunthorpe game, when he just needed that injection to help him and he'll have on after this game.
 "Playing that central role in the back three the other night, it's probably the least demanding position on the pitch in our system.
 "We expect the other centre-backs to join in when we're in possession, which is something he's done for us when he's played there.
 "Lessening the workload in the last couple of weeks has helped him, as well, and he felt good in the game.
 "He's certainly had no adverse reaction to playing the other night."

Gierhart’s noteworthy soccer stats were next on the agenda, including being a four-year starter, playing in 82 games, 50 career goals, 49 career assists, 56 career saves and only gave up 13 goals as goalkeeper.
 “As a Racer soccer alumnus myself, I am beyond excited to see Angela continue her soccer career at Murray State,” said Traylor. “The Racer program is one of the best in the OVC and it’s very exciting she’s going to be a part of it for the next four years. She is going to shine as a Racer soccer player. She has a winner’s mentality. They’re a winning program and she knows how to win.”
 Gierhart has been a fixture at Racer games and talked about the difference in actually playing instead of spectating. She also addressed which parts of her game she needs to elevate now that she’s moving up to a higher competitive level.
 “I need to work on handling the ball more, working on being more confident dribbling, shooting and knowing I can do those things,” said Gierhart.
 When asked about what parts of her game would help the Racers program, Traylor replied, “I would say her versatility. She’s not a player that comes in and only plays one position. She’s going to want to be on the field so wherever they tell her to play she’s going to do it.”
 Racer head coach Matt Lodge recruited Gierhart because of that versatility.
 “Her ability to play multiple spots,” said Lodge when asked why he recruited her. “She played multiple sports and is a pure athlete. I worked with her at the club level so I know how she works. She’s going to put her all into everything she does.” Lodge projects Gierhart playing the wide mid-field role, but will wait until she gets to campus to see exactly where and how she fits into their system.
 She grew up a Racer fan with deep family ties to the program and the school and really only looked at MSU when she was going through the school selection process. Staying home was important.
 “One thing I’ve done over the last couple of years in recruiting is bring in someone that’s got passion and a real desire to play for the school,” said Lodge. “They’re not just in it to say they played Division I or say they played college soccer, but they love being part of the school. You want kids around like that.”
 Gierhart will be joining a Racer squad that is extremely young and last year only had seven upperclassman out of 26 players and so she could have a chance to shine early if she works hard enough.
 “Freshmen come in with a clean slate, but everyone’s got to come in and work for their spot. She’s got the ability to play. She’s going to have to come in fit and be ready to work. We cram 20 games into a three-month schedule and we need to be healthy. Specifically, I want her to get out of her shell a little bit and I think for her the possibilities are endless once we get her comfortable, adjusted to the college scene and the speed of play.”
 Assuming the NCAA soccer season stays as scheduled, the Racers open their season in Morehead against Morehead State on March 2, and the first chance to see her at Cutchin Field is March 5 against Eastern Kentucky.

This Wednesday, Nov. 11, in addition to honoring our veterans, America celebrated a once-in-a lifetime event: the quadricentennial of the Mayflower Compact signed in 1620.
 First, a refresher why we should celebrate the Mayflower Compact. Four hundred years ago this week, religious freedom-seeking Pilgrims arrived in the New World near Cape Cod, Mass., far from their Virginia destination. This and other misfortunes caused many on board to consider their English charter with the Virginia Company null and void.
 In order to prevent a mutiny and quickly establish a set of rules for everyone to live by — even before settlement was established on land — Pilgrim leaders signed a new agreement aboard the Mayflower on Nov. 11, 1620. The Pilgrim leaders drew upon the ancient tradition of social contracts or covenants between parties to guide them.
 This particular agreement was unique because it was the first written example of self-government in the New World. Additionally, it was a contract between individuals and not a monarchy. It also ensured a working social structure where none existed. Finally, it worked so well for the new colony that it remained in effect until 1691. The agreement eventually became known as the Mayflower Compact.
 Historians and our founders consider the Mayflower Compact the forerunner to our Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution. In 1802, Sen. John Quincy Adams wrote, “That [the Mayflower Compact] is perhaps the only instance in human history of that positive, original social compact, which speculative philosophers have imagined as the only legitimate source of government. Here was unanimous and personal assent, by all the individuals of the community, to the association by which they became a nation.”

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has publicly disengaged from the battle against the coronavirus at a moment when the disease is tearing across the United States at an alarming pace.
 Trump, fresh off his reelection loss to President-elect Joe Biden, remains angry that an announcement about progress in developing a vaccine for the disease came after Election Day. And aides say the president has shown little interest in the growing crisis even as new confirmed cases are skyrocketing and hospital intensive care units in parts of the country are nearing capacity.
 Public health experts worry that Trump’s refusal to take aggressive action on the pandemic or to coordinate with the Biden team during the final two months of his presidency will only worsen the effects of the virus and hinder the nation’s ability to swiftly distribute a vaccine next year.
 The White House coronavirus task force held its first post-election meeting Monday. Officials discussed the rising case numbers and the promise of a vaccine in development by Pfizer, and they recognized the service of Navy Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, a member of the task force who retired Monday.
 But Trump, who does not take part in the task force meetings, remains preoccupied with last week’s election results. He has yet to weigh in on the recent spike in virus cases that has state and local officials scrambling and hospitals concerned about their ability to treat those stricken.
 With more than 100,000 new confirmed U.S. cases reported daily for more than a week, Trump has been more focused on tracking the rollout of a vaccine, which won’t be widely available for months. He has fumed that Pfizer intentionally withheld an announcement about progress on its vaccine trial until after Election Day, according to a White House official who was not authorized to publicly comment and spoke on condition of anonymity. Pfizer said it did not purposely withhold trial results.
 Although the president has consistently played down the pandemic, which has killed more than 240,000 Americans and infected more than 10 million people in the U.S., public health experts expressed worry about Trump’s silence on the troubling spike in cases, as well as his refusal to begin coordination on virus issues with Biden's transition team.
 “It’s a big problem,” said Dr. Abraar Karan, a global health specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “The transition is not going to happen until January, and we are in a complete crisis right now. We already know where this is headed. ... It’s not good enough to say we’re going to wait until the next president to address this.”
 The president’s silence comes as numerous White House and campaign officials have tested positive for the virus in recent days.
 White House chief of staff Mark Meadows tested positive last week after attending an election night party at the White House. Others at the party also have tested positive, including White House political director Brian Jack, former White House aide Healy Baumgardner and Trump campaign advisers David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski said Thursday that he believes he contracted the virus in Philadelphia while assisting the president’s election challenge there.
 Meanwhile, state and local officials around the country are scrambling in the midst of mounting caseloads. While Trump stays silent, they are urging their residents to step up mask wearing and social distancing, as they brace for what many epidemiologists worry is the beginning of a tumultuous period.
 In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has issued an order starting Friday for bars, restaurants and gyms to be closed by 10 p.m., and has set a cap of 10 people for private gatherings. In Illinois, public health officials asked employers to allow their personnel to work from home when possible and urged residents to stay at home as much as possible and skip nonessential travel.
 In Iowa, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who resisted coronavirus restrictions, announced earlier this week that masks will now be required at indoor events of more than 25 people, and she banned outside events of 100 or more people unless all attendees wear masks.
 Trump hasn’t answered questions since before Election Day. That hasn’t slowed his Twitter habit, but he’s used it almost exclusively in recent days to rage over the election results and spread unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud.
 By late Thursday afternoon, Trump had tweeted or retweeted more than three dozen times that day. Just one was related to the virus — a retweet of a posting by Sen. David Perdue about Georgia receiving 2,000 vials of a new antibody treatment.
 White House officials declined to comment Thursday on when Trump last engaged with members of the coronavirus task force but insisted he remains focused on the pandemic
 “The president is regularly briefed about the coronavirus,” said White House spokesperson Sarah Matthews. “The relevant information is brought to him on the big decisions, and then he moves forward in the way that’s best for our country.”
 The White House announced Thursday evening that Trump would get an update Friday on Operation Warp Speed, the multi-agency effort to get a vaccine to market as speedily and safely as possible.
 In the closing days of the campaign, Trump sought to reassure Americans that the country was “rounding the corner” on the virus, and he wrongly predicted that Democrats' focus on the disease would go away right after the election. The president pushed a sunny public tone even after he tested positive for the virus in early October and was hospitalized for three days after contracting the virus. His wife, Melania, and teenage son, Barron, also contracted the virus.
 Biden, for his part, largely framed the election as a referendum on Trump’s handling of the pandemic. He has made addressing the virus his top priority as he moves forward with his transition. He spoke by phone Thursday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about the intensifying pandemic and prospects for passage of a COVID-19 relief bill in the lame duck session of Congress.
 Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris met virtually with his new coronavirus advisers this week, and Biden delivered remarks warning Americans that ’’the challenge before us right now is still immense and growing.”
 “We could save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democratic or Republican lives, American lives,” Biden said in a speech this week. “Please, I implore you, wear a mask.”
 Incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Biden will appoint a “COVID coordinator” who will lead the administration’s pandemic response. Klain, speaking on MSNBC Thursday night, said the individual will have “direct access” to the president and will brief him daily on the pandemic. A team of people underneath the coordinator will supervise vaccine distribution, address supply chain disruptions and improve access to testing.
 Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University’s law school, said Biden will only be able to “scratch the surface” of tackling a pandemic that could be a “raging forest fire” by the time he takes office on Jan. 20.
 He added that even the good news on Pfizer’s development of a vaccine that showed 90% efficacy in early trial results could be diminished if Trump doesn’t begin coordination efforts with Biden’s team on how to roll out the vaccine. Some public health experts believe the task of persuading Americans to take the vaccine and widely distributing it could be as complicated as the vaccine's development.
 “I fear the next three months ahead could be the worst we’ve faced during the pandemic,” Gostin said. “America is like a ship at storm, and the captain has decided to go play golf.”

 # Military voters fear they’re part of unsupported fraud claim
 Michelle L. Price, Michael Balsamo and Anthony Izaguirre
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Las Vegas_ – Even before Attorney General William Barr issued a memo that authorized federal prosecutors across the country to investigate “substantial allegations” of voting irregularities if they exist, the Justice Department had already begun looking into two specific allegations.
 One was a claim from the Trump campaign that thousands of people may have improperly voted. The other was an allegation from a postal worker in Pennsylvania that a postmaster had instructed workers to backdate ballots mailed after Election Day.
 But so far, neither case appears to hold much water, according to details about the probes. And the first accusation has U.S. military personnel in Nevada concerned they have been drawn into unsubstantiated fraud claims.
 There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election despite President Donald Trump’s claims. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities that elected Democrat Joe Biden the next president.
 Still, lawyers from Trump’s campaign sent a letter to Barr alleging they had uncovered what they described as “criminal voter fraud” in Nevada and saying they had identified 3,062 people who “improperly” cast mail ballots in Clark County, a Democrat-heavy area that includes Las Vegas and about 75% of the state’s population.
 Those people were identified by “cross-referencing the names and addresses of voters with the National Change of Address database,” according to the letter.
 A copy of the Nevada letter provided to The Associated Press included a 62-page chart enumerating each voter but the listing did not include the name, address or party affiliation. Instead, it listed voters by the county, city, state and zip code they moved from, and the city, state and nine-digit zip code they moved to. The full nine-digit zip code can narrow an address down to a particular segment of a few blocks or even one side of a street, according to the U.S. Postal Service.
 With Biden leading Trump by wide margins in key battleground states, none of those issues would have any impact on the outcome of the election, including Nevada and Pennsylvania, where Biden is winning by 37,000 votes and 54,000 votes, respectively.
 But voting rights activists say hundreds of people on the list appear to be linked to the U.S. military. The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, which is doing election protection work, found 157 voters who listed a military base post office, according to staff attorney Nikki Levy, meaning they likely voted legally under added protections in federal law allowing absentee voting for military members and their families.
 Nevada election law stipulates that in order to register to vote, an individual must have been a resident for 30 days preceding an election, but does not specify how long an already registered voter must be physically present in the state in order to participate in an election.
 The Nevada Secretary of State’s office said voters do not lose their eligibility to vote or void their registration when they leave the state temporarily, even for long periods of time, and they may travel for 30 days or more and still cast a ballot.
 Federal and state law allows otherwise eligible voters to be exempt from any requirements that they reside in a state for any amount of time in order to cast a vote in a presidential election. A citizen who moves within 30 days before an election has the right to vote in their new state or their prior state of residence. Voters who take advantage of that only vote for president and vice president. They do not get to vote in any other contests.
 Clark County Registrar of Voters Joe Gloria responded to the Trump campaign’s allegations at a news conference last week, saying his office was reviewing a list of names that the campaign sent him, but said the allegation involves “something that happens regularly.”
 “You don’t have to live here in order to be eligible to vote here. This is a military town,” he said, referring to Nellis Air Force Base, which sits northeast of Las Vegas. He also that noted Nevadans who leave the state for college often vote by mail. The students and military families, while not physically in the state, “are eligible to vote here in Nevada,” he said.
 It’s hard to know offhand how many military families are on the Trump campaign list because not all service members use their base post office as their address, ACLU lawyer Levy said. It includes voters living in cities where there are military installations and it likely includes a good number of college students as well, she said.
 Rebekah Mattes, a civil servant who now lives in Stuttgart, Germany, said she believes she found herself and her husband, who is in the Air Force, on the list because it includes only two voters who made the same move they did from North Las Vegas to their new zip code in Germany.
 “It’s a little disheartening that this process that’s in place for people like my family, to be able to exercise their right to vote, is being questioned,” Mattes said.
 Mattes said absentee voting is something she and her family relied on growing up as her father was in the Air Force. She said it was concerning that it appeared her vote was being labeled as potentially fraudulent, along with hundreds of others, without anything to base it on.
 “That’s a pretty broad brush to be painting with for something that’s this important,” she said.
 Her comments were echoed by other military families who had the same concerns. Some cited security worries about having details about their past residences and their new nine-digit zip codes being linked and released.
 Justice officials would not comment on the investigation.
 Shortly after the Trump campaign sent the letter, Barr gave prosecutors the ability to go around longstanding Justice Department policy that normally would prohibit such overt actions before the election is certified. Soon after it was issued, the department’s top elections crime official announced he would step aside from that position because of the memo.
 The issues Trump’s campaign and its allies have pointed to are typical in every election: Problems with signatures, secrecy envelopes and postal marks on mail-in ballots, as well as the potential for a small number of ballots miscast or lost.
 Trump’s campaign has also launched legal challenges complaining that their poll watchers were unable to scrutinize the voting process. Many of those challenges have been tossed out by judges, some within hours of their filing; and again, none of the complaints show any evidence that the outcome of the election was impacted.
 Another active probe in Pennsylvania, meanwhile, appears to have fallen apart after the employee recanted the allegations in an interview with the postal service’s inspector general’s office, people familiar with the matter said. It is a federal crime to make a materially false statement to a federal agent. The people were not authorized to speak about an ongoing investigation and spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity.
 The employee, Richard Hopkins, admitted in an interview with the Postal Service’s inspector general that allegations were based on parts of a conversation he overheard among co-workers at the mail facility where he works in Erie. He also said an affidavit cited by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee – and forwarded to the Justice Department by Graham – was written by Project Veritas, a conservative group that has been promoting voter fraud accusations on social media.
 He agreed that some of the statements in the affidavit should have included amendments or caveats and also agreed to sign a new statement that undercut some of his main claims in the initial affidavit, according to a recording of the interview posted by Project Veritas.

Woda sottolinea come questa nuova vettura rientri nella politica di M-Sport, ovvero «fornire ogni opportunità per la prossima generazione di piloti», che potranno farsi le ossa con una vettura a trazione integrale e dai costi accessibili. «La Fiesta Rally3 non sarà in alcun modo un'alternativa a qualsiasi auto che è attualmente in circolazione - spiega ancora il direttore di M-Sport Poland -, ma sarà un concept nuovo di zecca al servizio di quella che è stata un'area molto poco servita dei rally. Sarà il trampolino di lancio perfetto per coloro che passano dalle due alle quattro ruote motrici, consentendo ai piloti di apprendere e affinare le abilità necessarie per gestire le auto a trazione integrale, il che è un passo enorme per qualsiasi guidatore.

Although the pause on debt-service payments was welcomed as a reprieve, experts have pointed to the constraints of a scheme that leaves out private lenders like investment firms, banks and bondholders. Without buy-in from the private sector, economists say that poor countries’ emergency funds may just land in other lenders’ pockets, regardless of the G-20’s concessions.
 The group’s new “case-by-case approach” to debt negotiations unveiled Friday, also endorsed by the Paris Club, a group of mostly Western sovereign lenders, requires “fair burden sharing” among all official creditors — suggesting that China and its disparate lending agencies will have to get on board. It asks that private creditors offer debt treatment “at least as favorable” as that offered by creditor countries.
 Mohammed al-Jadaan, the finance minister for Saudi Arabia, this year’s chair of the G-20, hailed the framework as “an unprecedented agreement and a major breakthrough in international debt agenda.”
 Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, echoed the praise, saying the agreement would make the participation of private creditors “more likely” and “increase the viability of our action.”
