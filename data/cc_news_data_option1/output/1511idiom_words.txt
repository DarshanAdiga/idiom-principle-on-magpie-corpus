"articleBody": "Modernist Turkish poetry developed through two major movements – namely, the &quot;Garip&quot; (Strange) and &quot;İkinci Yeni&quot; (Second New) movements – which have been in a long-lasting contradiction. While the Garip movement&#39;s poets refused the tradition of the early modernism developed by late Ottoman poets such as Yahya Kemal and Ahmet Haşim, the İkinci Yeni poets directly attacked the poetry by Garip poets. The Garip movement is deemed to be the poetry of the so-called “little man” that is the secular petit-bourgeois of the 1940s, dichotomized by the existentialist portrayal of the abstract human being by the İkinci Yeni. A good example to differentiate the world images of the two movements would be that Garip poetry is the tram that takes you from Laleli and drops you at Sirkeci (two real stops of the tramway in old Istanbul), while the İkinci Yeni tram carries you from Laleli to the world.

Only one man chose not to deny his affiliation with the Garip when joining the İkinci Yeni: Metin Eloğlu. A peer of Tomris Uyar and Edip Cansever, he never disdained his early poetry perhaps because he didn’t make a 180-degree shift from realism to imagism. Eloğlu is a mediator between two clashing movements, and his poetry reflects the strengths and weaknesses of both. He speaks of real persona with an imagist touch.

Beginning with the 1950s, Turkish poets had to pick a side, meaning that each poet would either write the realist petit-bourgeois poetry of the Garip or the imagist poetry of the İkinci Yeni. The initiators of the İkinci Yeni, Sezai Karakoç and Cemal Süreya, had discardable connections with the Garip movement even in their early poetry, while some other major poets joining them in imagism, such as Turgut Uyar and Edip Cansever, had a considerable past with the Garip. However, other poets like Behçet Necatigil, who belonged to the lyrical Republican poetry of the pre-Garip times and had been with them for a long time, became followers of İkinci Yeni. Oktay Rifat, another poet who sided with the İkinci Yeni even though he was one of the three major poets of the Garip. Many others left their affiliation with the Garip movement behind to join the İkinci Yeni as a ruling movement in the Turkish poetry circles.
