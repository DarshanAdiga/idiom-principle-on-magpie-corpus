Austrian conservative leader Sebastian Kurz is on the brink of returning to power as a coalition deal with the left-wing Greens is likely to be struck this week, three months after his party won a parliamentary election, both sides indicated on Sunday.
 Late Saturday the Greens called a meeting of their party's top decision-making body next weekend to sign off on a deal, indicating they expect the accord to be finalized before then. On Sunday morning Kurz and Greens leader Werner Kogler said the deal could happen "by the middle of the coming week".
 A deal would make Kurz chancellor again after his coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) collapsed in May over a video sting that felled FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache. A provisional government of civil servants is in place for the time being until a coalition is formed.

When you’re away from home, parents need to be forgiving with routine. Bed and meal times may be set at home during the school and work weeks, but let loose a bit on vacation. It’s not the end of the world if you have a late breakfast and happen to skip lunch. Just make sure you have a few snacks on reserve to get you through the gap between meals. Sticking to a schedule when you’re not in your usual elements can be unnecessarily stressful.
 Bring the survival items. Travelling with multiple people can come with a plethora of requests, so make sure you have the basics: wet wipes, bottles of water, healthy snacks, a deck of cards, and a pad of paper with a pen. These items can help you get through lengthy layovers, long car rides, and child meltdowns.
 Confirm everything before you leave. There’s nothing worse than arriving at your destination only to find out something was screwy with your dates, etc. Confirm flight times, hotel and rental car reservations, tickets for events, etc.

The excess weight created even more health issues. So, she – like so many – has resolved to hit the gym and change her diet. She signed up for a trainer at Crunch Gym in South Tampa.
 And so far. “It has been life-changing,” she says.
 But despite those best intentions, a new study from the Harvard School of Public Health finds Americans are getting heavier, and by the end of this new decade, about half of us – 49% – will be obese.
 “Everybody has their own thing. You know?” said Cerdric Tyson, leaving the gym after a workout.
 “Sometimes with the stress of life it’s hard to keep a regimen.”
 “A lot of people fall short of their goals because they don’t have consistency,” said Nick Filloramo, General Manager at Crunch South Tampa.
 Filloramo says if people are really dedicated to reversing the trend, they need to stick to those resolutions – and not just for a few weeks or months. That means setting realistic goals.
 Baby steps, as he puts it.
 “It’s all about doing it over the long haul. Changing your diet slightly. Getting more hours of rest every night. Pushing yourself to small goals to eventually achieve those large goals that you want to see in 2020,” said Filloramo.
 Researchers at Harvard and George Washington University say the surging obesity numbers are also based on a more realistic look in the mirror. They discovered phone surveys – more than 6 million taken over 23 years – had underestimated the obesity rate because people had been self-reporting themselves as being taller and lighter than they really are.
 According to the Harvard health study, obesity is measured by body mass index.
 By that standard, about 40% of Americans are currently considered obese, but that number is projected to increase by more than 20% over the next 10 years.

PALM BEACH, FLORIDA - President Donald Trump says the federal government will soon announce a new strategy to tackle underage vaping, promising, "We're going to protect our families, we're going to protect our children, and we're going to protect the industry."
 Trump was vague about what the plan would entail but suggested "certain flavors" in cartridge-based e-cigarettes would be taken off the market "for a period of time."

During a campaign stop in Memphis, Tennessee. this month, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called out Trump on health care, saying the president is "determined to throw Americans off the boat, without giving them a lifeline."
 Polling suggests Trump's failure to follow through on his promise to deliver a revamped health care system could be a drag on his reelection effort.
 Voters have consistently named health care as one of their highest concerns in polling. And more narrowly, a recent Gallup-West Health poll found that 66% of adults believe the Trump administration has made little or no progress curtailing prescription drug costs.
 Prescription drug prices did drop 1% in 2018, according to nonpartisan experts at U.S. Health and Human Services.
 That was the first such price drop in 45 years, driven by declines for generic drugs, which account for nearly 9 out of 10 prescriptions dispensed. Prices continued to rise for brand-name drugs, although at a more moderate pace.
 Trump's broadsides against the pharmaceutical industry might well have helped check prices, though drug companies have been hammered by every major Democrat as well as many Republican lawmakers.
 Trump says a health insurance overhaul can be done in a second term if voters give him a Republican Congress as well as a reelection win.
 But Trump and the GOP had that chance when they were in full control and unable to deliver, because Republicans don't agree among themselves.
 Trump could still score a big win on prescription drugs before the 2020 election. He's backing a bipartisan Senate bill that would limit what Medicare recipients pay out of pocket for their medicines and require drug companies to pay rebates to the government if they increase prices above inflation.
 Passing it would require the cooperation of Pelosi, harshly criticized by Trump over impeachment.

Candidates contesting the Maharashtra Assembly elections will be under watch not just physically, but also in the cyberspace, with the Election Commission of India (ECI) setting up a dedicated cell to monitor their activities on social media platforms ahead of the polls.
 Cyber crime officials said the social media monitoring cell was set up earlier this month, in light of the observation that social media has become a popular platform for election-related activities.
 The cell will be headed by Superintendent of Police Balsing Rajput, Maharashtra Cyber, who is also the nodal officer for Maharashtra for the cell.
 “We are watching out for any and all content uploaded on social media that could amount to violation of any kind, and will be reporting these instances to the relevant authorities. This includes scanning all mediums like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram,” Mr. Rajput said.
 The cell will mainly be keeping an eye out for three kinds of violations.
 The first kind is any content being shared that might amount to defamation, rumour-mongering or fake news, and such instances will be forwarded to the concerned police units for further action. The second is violation of the model code of conduct, which will be reported to the ECI. The third category is of posts that might give rise to law and order problems, in which case they will be removed from the internet.
 “There is a lot of scope for violations through social media, such as holding live events on Facebook or Instagram when campaigning is forbidden, or uploading advertisements of candidates on such platforms when it is not allowed. Any activities which hamper the election process will be liable for action,” Mr. Rajput said.
 The cell will also scan social media for posts by citizens drawing attention to wilful violations of the model code of conduct by candidates or their supporters, including enticement for votes and use of force or intimidation, officers said.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - Police have made an arrest in the death of a cab driver found gunned down in his car on a December night in north Columbia.Paul Swatsell, 53, worked for Checker Yellow Cab.He picked up five juveniles at a Waffle House on the night of Dec. 15. When he dropped them off, police said the teens robbed him and shot him, causing his car to crash into a tree.Pastor says cab driver killed in shooting ‘would have given the shirt off his back to anyone’Columbia cab driver killed in shooting identified, next of kin soughtOfficers said they were able to identify all the juveniles involved based on tips and video surveillance.Police arrested two 14-year-olds, charging them with murder and armed robbery, among other offenses. Their names have not been released.Swatsell’s death is a tragedy that many co-workers and friends said has been difficult to process.“We’re still kind of in a state of shock. It’s just very tragic and sad,” Peyton Greene, the Checker Yellow Cab Company owner, said.Greene said the company is like a family, and Swatsell’s fellow cab drivers have felt angry and sad losing Swatsell that way.“It’s very tragic and sad what happened to Paul,” Greene said. “I mean Paul would have given the money. There’s no reason for these kids to shoot and murder Paul. He was just a hardworking, dedicated, and loyal guy. Just an awesome guy.”His generosity and kind spirit is something that friends, including his pastor at Abundant Life Assembly of God in West Columbia, spoke about in the wake of his death.“He would have given the shirt off his back to anyone. If these assailants had just asked for money he would have reached into his pocket and given it. They didn’t have to blow him away,” Pastor Jerry Flowers said.Pastor Jerry Flowers told WIS in an interview a few days after Swatsell’s funeral he had been driving a cab for over 30 years, fulfilling a life-long dream.“I said when you were a kid what did you want to be and he said a cab driver. He loved meeting people,” Pastor Flowers said.Pastor Flowers said after Swatsell was killed the church held a prayer service for all cab drivers.“These cab drivers, their lives are really on the line,” Pastor Flowers said. “Because when they pick up someone they don’t know the person they’ve picked up and what might be their intentions.”Greene said Swatsell’s coworkers are facing a new round of shock in the wake of the arrests of two teens, announced by Columbia Police Chief Skip Holbrook yesterday.“We were shocked; 14 years old. They are still a child,” Greene said.Greene said he was at the bond hearings of one of the 14-year-olds today, along with a few of Swatsell’s co-workers and friends, wanting to honor the man who was so generous to so many.Greene said that Checker Cab Company doesn’t plan to make any changes in the wake of this shooting, but they do have safety measures in place for drivers and riders, including a way to call the company dispatch from their app.Greene said the juvenile’s lawyers waived their right to a bond hearing, and both are still behind bars.Chief Skip Holbrook said the investigation is open and there could be more arrests.Copyright 2019 WIS.

WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - Officers describe fighting for their lives after brushes with deadly fentanyl, but medical experts say their research suggests drugs aren’t the culprit.Over the last several years, there are dozens of reports of first responders requiring overdose reversal drugs after coming in contact with or being around opioids. Toledo Police Det. Lisa Fauver is one of them.Every time the radio crackles, Fauver holds her breath. About a year-and-a-half ago, she says the last call of the day almost turned into the last day of her life."it’s hard still, every time I hear an overdose call on the radio, it gets me," she said.Responding to a Toledo home to revive an overdosing drug user – Fauver began to feel odd symptoms herself. "I thought maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me."Back in her cruiser, she said her body stiffened and her head flew back. She radioed her brand-new partner for help as she grabbed a spare opiate reversal drug, and inhaled. "I just knew if I did not do that to myself, I would not be here," she said in a one-on-one interview.She recalls being pulled out of the car as she drifted in and out of consciousness. Retelling the story brought her to tears. "Seizing, a lot of seizing, convulsions, not being able to breathe, sweating, this weird sweating," she said describing her symptoms before explaining her mindset, "thinking that my husband might not have his wife my children might not have their mom, that was the hard part."Fauver’s partner, Offc. Juana Trevino, never imagined the first time he responded to an overdose, he would administer multiple reversal doses to his own partner. "We were just trying to get her to breathe, and stay with us," he remembered, "at one point her eyes did roll in the back of her head and then we were tapping on her head saying, 'Lisa, Lisa, you’re going home, stay with us’."Fauver's not the only officer with an experience like this, though few ever share their story publicly. But, leading medical experts said these stories don’t lineup with science and there’s no evidence they’re even medically possible."There’s a persistent myth that you can get poisoned or overdose from fentanyl just by having it touch you or just by being in the room with you," said Dr. Andrew Stolbach, "and that’s a myth."Stolbach, a leading overdose researcher, spends his days in Johns Hopkins University Medical Center’s Emergency Room.He said it is possible to accidentally inhale the drug, but said for it to lead to an overdose, there would have to be so much of it in the air that you could visibly see it. "You can’t get sick from fentanyl just from being in the room with it, or just by having it touch your skin."Fauver wore gloves and a facemask that day. She’s not sure what happened, but guesses she either inhaled airborne particles – or put herself at risk by washing off her hands with hand sanitizer rather than soap and water, which may make the skin more absorbent to drugs."That’s always been a theoretical concern," said Stolbach of the possibility that hand sanitizer could facilitate an overdose, "I don’t know that that’s ever been studied or tested." But, he did say he and other experts do recommend washing off with water and soap if possible if one comes in physical contact with a deadly drug.Stolbach said he has reviewed almost every report of first responder overdoses up through 2017. He said the symptoms described in reports are often inconsistent with an overdose, and he has yet to see one confirmed by a drug test."[Medical experts are] not saying these people are fakers, and we’re not saying they’re crazy," he made clear, noting legitimate fear of these drugs can create powerful physical responses."People have experienced real symptoms, it’s just my belief and belief of other medical toxicologists based on science that the symptoms they are experiencing are not from opioids," Stolbach said.Doctors hope law enforcement will begin collecting and sharing more data with researchers, so they can get a better idea of what exactly is going on.Many officers exposed to opiates are never tested after a scare like Fauver’s. She said her hospital drug test came back clean, but has no doubt that she nearly died of an overdose that day."Oh, I am actually convinced, convinced," she said.Fauver would return safely to her family later that night, but never returned to her old beat. She studied to become a detective, and investigates property crimes now, and isn’t likely to find herself in a similar situation again.Specialized drug investigators are also more likely to be sent to overdose scenes in Toledo following Fauver’s scare.Meanwhile, in the small village of Newtown outside Cincinnati, Police Chief Tom Synan says he wants to make sure his officers don’t slow their response time by taking unnecessary precautions.Given the threat of exposure isn’t as high as previously experts previously believed, he said rather than getting into full hazmat gear, more basic steps will adequately protect his officers."We have to be careful; we have to weigh the caution along with doing our jobs too," said Synan, "the thing is, if we take these precautions, wearing the gloves, wearing a facemask if you want, wearing eye protection, changing those gloves, you reduce the risk significantly."And, Synan said every second saved gearing up, could be the precious time needed to save the life of an overdosing drug user.Copyright 2019 Gray DC.
