Witty and impeccably paced, Autumn de Winter and Eleanor Catton's take on Jane Austen's 1815 classic doesn't reinvent the wheel so much as give it a good spit-polish before sending it on its merry way. Bolstered by an impressively on-point performance from Anya Taylor-Joy in the title role and gorgeously shot by cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt, it ticks all the right period drama boxes without succumbing to blandness.

And this, I think, is also part of what accounts for the outpour of (entirely legitimate) anger and outrage after yesterday's umpteenth tragedy. To put it simply: people are perfectly justified in feeling 'unsafe'... also because they rightly suspect that the authorities are (to put it bluntly) prioritising the economic input of the construction sector, over their own life and limb.

We're allowed to take naughty pleasure in Emma's gentle skewering of the more pretentious aspects of her social circle, but at the same time, we're rooting for the better angels of her nature to pull through before she hurts the ones who don't deserve the puncturing power of her cruel gaze and crueller tongue. This does, of course, come to pass, and Catton and de Winter cleverly split the mood down the middle - with its first half devoted to witty fun and games - with staging and choreography that would not be out of place on an opera stage - and the second allowing for the deeper affective keynotes to shine through. Both Taylor-Joy and Flynn weather the moods like true champs, the latter emerging as the kind of paragon of stoic virtue that makes the best of Austen's male characters so eminently swoonable.

return against top contender Dan Hooker according to reports.
 The match-up although not official is believed to be in the works to headline at UFC San Diego on May 16 per MMA Junkie who cite two anonymous sources with knowledge of the deal.
 Poirier hasn’t fought since losing his 155lb unification fight against Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 242 in September. ‘The Diamond’ came up short against the Russian who picked up a third-round submission win when the pair met in Abu Dhabi.
 Prior to this loss Poirier was in rare form picking up high profile wins over Max Holloway, Justin Gaethje and Eddie Alvarez. Since suffering defeat 'The Diamond' has been nursing a hip injury and seeking the biggest fights possible.
 In comes New Zealand fighter Dan Hooker, fresh off the back of the biggest win of his career. The 30-year-old from Auckland beat Paul Felder over five rounds in front of his hometown fans last month. He’ll be hoping to be more convincing in his next fight after many fans thought he lucky to emerge victorious against Felder.

WORCESTER -- In a rematch of the last two Division 1 Central semifinals between Natick and Wachusett, the two teams went to overtime for the second year in a row - but this time it was the Redhawks that came out on top.
 Natick senior Brenna McDonald scored 32 points as she led the third-seeded Redhawks to a 64-54 overtime victory over the previously unbeaten No. 2 seed Mountaineers to advance to the Division 1 Central final for the first time since 2016.
 "It's an incredible feeling to be able to head (to the sectional finals)," McDonald said. "I've personally have never been because we we've lost to (Wachusett) twice here and then to a different team team another game.
 "Outside of me personally, I just want our team to go as far as possible because I see the potential in some of our younger players and I just want this to be as great of an experience it can be for them."
 It was the third year in a row in which the Redhawks had faced the Mountaineers in the Central semifinals. Wachusett defeated Natick in 2018, 53-46, before going into overtime with them last year.
 Now, the Redhawks face top-seeded Franklin (22-0) in the sectional finals on Friday (8 p.m.) at Worcester State University.
 "This overtime, we had the momentum going our way," Redhawks (20-2) coach Dan Hinnenkamp said. "When we played them last year, I believe we were up by seven in the fourth quarter and then they got the momentum going.
 "I think I recall calling a timeout around the six minute mark maybe and I think we were down by seven and I said, 'Hey, there is a ton of time,' and we started chipping away and started playing good defense, we made some shots," Hinnenkamp added. "The rest of the team stepped up. Alana Ciccorelli, who was a tad hesitant hit a big bucket at the end, and I think we had a little bit of a momentum swing going our way and I think we carried that over into the overtime. Last year, we were on the wrong end of that momentum, this year, we were on the right side of that momentum."
 Natick trailed Wachusett (20-1) by as many as seven points in the fourth quarter but proceeded to finish the quarter on an 11-4 run to send it to an extra session.
 McDonald hit back to back layups to cut it to a one-possession game. After a layup by Charlotte Head brought the lead back up to five, senior Delaney Ross hit a pair of free throws and McDonald finished a layup with the harm to tie the game at 50. Head then came down with a layup on the other end to make it 52-50, Mountaineers but Cicorelli scored her only points of the game on a layup to tie it at 52 and force it to overtime.
 "This time it was just a mental game where we stayed in the game," McDonald said. "Even though we played down in the first half, we brought ourselves back up and didn't let it get into our heads, we just took it to them."
 McDonald specifically took it to Wachusett scoring 26 of her game-high 32 points in the second half and overtime.
 "It started with our defense and our confidence," McDonald said. "In the first half we were being too tentative, letting them control the pace and in the second half, especially in overtime, we just played our brand of basketball and get rebounds and we did well."
 "I think in the first half she was being a little bit hesitant," said Hinnenkamp of McDonald. "I told her at halftime that she hadn't attempted a free throw yet, which basically meant that she really wasn't taking it hard to the basket as we wanted and so second half, you can see the intensity in her eyes a little bit and I think just sheer will on her part. I thought she had a phenomenal second half.
 "I haven't seen her play that dominant in awhile," Hinnenkamp added. "She's had herself a good season. I thought she looked great against some teams, but she really in that second half, had a different mentality."
 The Redhawks struggled in the first half, being held to just four points in the first quarter. Natick trailed by as many as 11 in the second half before they began to chip away at the deficit.
 The Redhawks, led by McDonald went on an 8-0 run to cut their deficit to two, before Wachusett senior Belle Lanpher (25 points) hit a three at the end of the third quarter to give the Mountaineers a five point lead heading into the fourth quarter.

Culmine della falsificazione: i ripetuti tentativi di addossare al governo siriano la responsabilità delle stragi condotte con gas nervini (responsabilità regolarmente smentita dall'Onu, nel silenzio imbarazzato dei media occidentali che si erano affrettati a incolpare Assad). Il tentativo di far crollare Damasco e smembrare la Siria (a nord, la Turchia avrebbe invaso l'odiato Kurdistan, mentre Israele nel frattempo s'è appropriato del Golan) è stato sventato soltanto dal risoluto intervento militare della Russia, a partire dalla fine del 2015. In pochi mesi, le forze russe - insieme alle milizie libanesi di Hezbollah e ai Pasdaran iraniani guidati da Qasem Soleimani - hanno permesso all'esercito di Damasco di liberare gran parte del paese, scacciando l'incubo del terrore jihadista. Il successo russo (militare, diplomatico e geopolitico) ha messo a nudo le responsabilità dell'Occidente nella spaventosa campagna terroristica organizzata in Siria. Una vittoria imperdonabile, costata probabilmente la vita allo stesso Soleimani, assassinato a tradimento da Trump all'inizio del 2020.

Right: at this point, a few provisos may be necessary. First off, it is too early to establish whether this latest collapse was caused specifically because the developers did not abide by the new building regulations launched in 2016; or, conversely, whether those conditions were simply insufficient to prevent it from happening anyway. For these and other conclusions, we shall have to wait for the outcome of whatever inquiries are ongoing.

By Swansy Afonso Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world threatened by trade wars. Sign up here. Steel mills in India are gearing up for an increase in demand from overseas buyers as the coronavirus outbreak chokes supplies from China. China is the world’s largest steelmaker and accounts for more than half of global output. The virus crisis has crippled demand and led to record high inventories of steel in the country, as migrant workers, who typically staff construction sites or drive trucks, are unable to return to work due to quarantine measures and movement restrictions. “There are opportunities in certain markets where China is not able to supply because Chinese ports are blocked and movement to the ports is also pretty impacted,” Jayant Acharya, director for marketing at JSW Steel Ltd., said by phone from Mumbai. Indian steelmakers could gain business from this month onward as supply gaps emerge in Southeast Asia, which is a big market for China, and the Middle East, he said. Indian mills have been shipping out more steel this year as domestic demand remains sluggish amid the slowest economic expansion in more than six years. India’s exports of finished steel jumped 40% in the 10 months to January to 7.2 million tons, according to the Steel Ministry. The virus outbreak “provides Indian steel producers an opportunity to cater to the traditional Chinese markets where Indian steel mills are also present,” Ranjan Dhar, chief marketing officer at ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Ltd., said in an emailed reply to queries. “It is important to note that voyage time from India to these markets is equal or better than China.” India’s biggest export markets in January were Vietnam, Italy, Nepal, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The country is the second-largest steelmaker after China. “Any exports will only be after meeting the domestic demand in full,” Dhar said. “Not only steel exports, even auto component exports from India can be an answer to supply disruptions from China.” Indian steelmakers are also expecting weaker imports from China, South Korea and Japan as these countries have been affected by the virus, leading them to increase prices in the South Asian country despite sluggish demand, Jayanta Roy, senior vice president at ICRA Ltd., the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service, said by phone. “Companies would first try to maximize their sales in the domestic market if prices are better here and only then willthey look for exports to ensure a decent capacity utilization,” he said. “It is little unclear at present how long this window is going to be open for them, as one doesn’t really know how long the coronavirus impact is going to stay.” 74486729
