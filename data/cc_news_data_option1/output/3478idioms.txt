"It was pretty easy," Reed said of his decision to re-sign with the Seahawks when he talked to media via Zoom Tuesday in what was his first talk with reporters since then. "I wanted to stay here. I love it here in Seattle."
 And as Barnwell wrote at the time, Reed "likely took a short-term deal in hopes of producing another big year before the salary cap rises dramatically in a couple of years" and, he hopes, being able to cash in even more greatly then.
 That, though, was before the COVID-19 crisis really hit and the NFL since agreed that it will spread out possible losses in revenue in cap hits over the next four years, meaning lots of potential uncertainty down the road for both teams and players.
 For Reed, there's only one thing to really do about it -- try to prove that the real Jarran Reed is the one from 2018, when he joined only future Hall of Famers Cortez Kennedy and John Randle as Seahawks defensive tackles to get 10 or more sacks in a season.
 And while sacks can often be somewhat fluky, Reed got his pretty consistently -- he had two in three games apiece but had at least half of a sack in eight games. He also had 24 quarterback hits, which ranked 12th in the NFL, going only five games without getting at least one, the kind of pass-rushing consistency not easy to achieve out of the tackle position.
 But any ability to build off that momentum was squashed when Reed found out in the spring of 2019 that he was being suspended for the first six games of the season for his involvement in a domestic violence incident in 2017 (he was not charged).

With the Supreme Judicial Court expected to hear arguments in a little over a week over a lawsuit challenging Gov. Charlie Baker's COVID-19 executive orders, Attorney General Maura Healey has filed a lengthy defense of the governor and the legality of his actions to control the coronavirus.
 Baker has been sued by a group of business owners, religious leaders and others over the numerous executive orders he has issued since declaring a public emergency on March 10 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The orders have included everything from forced business and school closures to size limits on indoor and outdoor gatherings.
 The plaintiffs claim that Baker overstepped his legal authority, but Healey argued in a briefing filed with the SJC that Baker acted well within the scope of the Civil Defense Act to protect the public from the coronavirus.
 "The CDA gives the Governor extensive authority to protect the Commonwealth during a civil defense emergency," Healey wrote. "The Act defines 'civil defense' broadly, and responding to the current pandemic falls within its scope because COVID-19 is a 'natural cause' that threatens the public health and welfare of the Commonwealth's residents."
 The response to the lawsuit was filed with the SJC on Friday, and the state's top court is expected to hear oral arguments on the lawsuit on Sept. 11. The Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance is not a plaintiff in the case, but supports the litigation.
 "After 171 days, this lawsuit has forced Governor Baker to finally put pen to paper and offer the people of Massachusetts a written, legal explanation as to why he believes he has the authority to violate their civil rights and bypass the state's Public Health Act," said Danielle Webb, a lawyer and chair of Fiscal Alliance Foundation.
 The lawsuit was initially filed in Worcester Superior Court by lawyers with the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a national non-profit organized to fight what it describes as the "unconstitutional administrative state."
 The group, on behalf of local plaintiffs, contends that the Civil Defense Act does not cover pandemics, and that the public health response should have come from local authorities.
 Healey, however, called that interpretation of the CDA "misguided."
 "This pandemic, which has killed 822,000 globally, including more than 8,700 Massachusetts residents statewide, is precisely the kind of civil defense emergency that warrants a coordinated state level response by the Governor under the Act," the Democrat wrote.
 The latest report from the Department of Public Health documented 118,483 cases of coronavirus in Massachusetts since March and 9,049 confirmed deaths from COVID-19.
 The actions taken by the governor, Healey said, are consistent with what is known about COVID-19, including that the virus is highly transmissible, spread by asymptomatic people and can be prevented by social distancing, frequent sanitizing and mask wearing.
 The attorney general said emergency measures taken by governors in times of public crises are typically afforded a "broad deference" by the courts, but even without that deference Healey said Baker's orders "readily survive scrutiny" under a traditional constitutional analysis.
 Healey also argued that the governor's orders respected the separation of powers between the executive and Legislative branches, and have been repeatedly affirmed by the Legislature through its passage of new laws predicated on the public health emergency.
 "Since the governor's emergency declaration, the Legislature has enacted a host of laws that approvingly acknowledge the state of emergency and are even contingent on the existence of a declared state of emergency," she wrote.
 Futhermore, she said nothing is preventing the Legislature from acting to reverse any of the governor's orders, from the forced closure of certain businesses to social distancing guidelines and travel restrictions.
 Baker joined the plaintiffs in July in requesting that the case be heard by the Supreme Judicial Court, and Justice Barbara Lenk agreed to have to case transferred.
 If Baker were to lose the case, it could unravel many of the safety measures he has put in place to try to control the spread of the virus at a time when many elementary, high school and college students are preparing to return to classrooms, at least part time.
 The plaintiffs include business owners in Hubbardston, Lexington, Burlington, and Marlborough, the pastors of churches in Westfield and Medford, and Ben Haskell, headmaster of Trinity Christian Academy in Hyannis.
 "People can debate the merits and shortcomings of the policies put forth by Governor Baker in his executive orders all day, but their legal authority should never be in question," said Paul Craney, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance.
 "The lawsuit does not take a position on the orders. Rather, it focuses entirely on the legal underpinnings behind them. We believe laws, especially any laws that for whatever reason may abridge our civil rights, must originate from the democratically elected legislature. In bypassing the laws prescribed by the legislature, these executive orders set a bad precedent for future emergency situations," Craney said.

Gurugram (Haryana) [India], September 2 (ANI/NewsVoir): An active professional from Ghaziabad was amongst the small percentage of the population infected with severe COVID-19 being treated at the critical unit of Artemis Hospitals, Gurugram. With each passing day, it became difficult for him and his family as his condition started deteriorating.   He had undergone an entire plethora of management right from medicinal therapy, high oxygen demand, ventilator requirement, tracheostomy. He was initially admitted in the COVID dedicated ICU where he recovered from the acute illness after aggressive treatment and finally tested negative. Despite the best efforts over 6 weeks, it was unable to bring him out of ventilation due to severely damaged (Fibrosed) lungs as part of Post-COVID-19 sequelae.   Most options for his acceptable recovery was exhausted though Dr Shivanshu Raj Goyal was determined to explore a better solution thus with the consent of the patient's family, Dr Goyal and his team derived an organized plan to offer a surgical cure in the form of a Lungs Transplant. Till now this procedure was not performed in India for a post-COVID sequelae case.   The patient was on a ventilator due to high oxygen demand and the possibility of the collapse was extremely high during the transport to the transplant center. Another big challenge was the unavailability of the donor's lungs with a long waiting list.   "Even though there was a high risk involved in it but we wanted to leave no stone unturned to save his life. No obstacle is big enough if the determination, right team spirit, and destiny is in the favor," said Dr Shivanshu Raj Goyal, Consultant, Respiratory/Pulmonology & Sleep Medicine, Artemis Hospitals.   "Decision of advising lung transplant was taken at the right time which resulted in transfer by air ambulance to Chennai at about 6 weeks after his initial admission," said Dr Reshma Tewari, Chief Critical Care Unit, Artemis Hospitals.   As fate would guide, the patient was airlifted in July 2020 to a Center more than 2000 km away and upon safe arrival was put on a transplant waitlist. Specialized technique ECMO was used by the transplant team to oxygenate the patient for 33 days. After the wait of over a month, finally, two matched and healthy lungs were available. On 27th August 2020, he had undergone India's first sequential bilateral lung transplant successfully, opening a ray of hope to many patients whose lungs have undergone irreversible changes secondary to COVID-19.   "We are grateful to the Artemis Hospitals and doctors who guided us with the right decision and helped us in facilitating this transplant," said Yash Verma, son of the patient.   This marks a first of such kind procedure to date reported from any part of Asia.   Artemis Hospitals, established in 2007, spread across 9 acres, is a 400 plus bed; state-of-the-art multi-speciality hospitals located in Gurugram, India. Artemis Hospitals is the first JCI and NABH accredited hospitals in Gurugram. Designed as one of the most advanced hospitals in India, Artemis provides a depth of expertise in the spectrum of advanced medical & surgical interventions, a comprehensive mix of inpatient and outpatient services.   Artemis has put modern technology in the hands of renowned doctors from across the country and abroad to set new standards in healthcare. The medical practices and procedures followed in the hospitals are research-oriented and benchmarked against the best in the world. A top-notch service, in a warm, open patient-centric environment, clubbed with affordability, has made it one of the most revered hospitals in the country.   This story is provided by NewsVoir.

When he signed, the Seahawks were thinking they could pair him again with Clowney, hopefully this time getting a full season of the two working together.
 Clowney, stunningly, remains unsigned, so maybe that could still happen. And most still expect that Seattle could make another move to bolster its defensive line.
 But what could serve as one of the biggest boosts for the Seahawks is a return by Reed to his 2018 form.
 Tuesday, Reed said don't be surprised if that's what happens.
 "I know what I'm capable of doing," he said. "But it's definitely key that I get back to that. That playmaking ability. That spirit there that never left. You know nobody's perfect and no season's gonna be perfect. Sometimes you're gonna have a downfall, especially when you have so much production the year before -- you're gonna be a little bit more keyed on. Now we've got guys around us that are going to make plays and open up doors for everybody to make plays. And that's just the way it's gonna go and I'm just ready to get to it."

With the environments, they are quite large and even a good player will be spending a fair amount of time in them. Ori is a game that has music that is almost omnipresent, it's just part of the DNA. With that, a lot of music needs to be written to cover the environments, but instead of just writing incredibly long music tracks or delivering stems that are mixed on the fly by middleware, I chose to write curated but fixed tracks of 3-5 minutes in length that would then move into a new track based on actions that Ori completes during the game. The advantage of creating the fixed tracks is that I can fully control the overall flow of the music. It's something that works for a game like this.

Reed was able to go through the preseason with the Seahawks a year ago but then had to disappear once the regular season started. And while he downplayed the impact of that at the time, Tuesday he admitted it was a difficult period.
 "I don't make excuses," he said. "I could have came in and done a way better job. But it was very different for me, something I'd never been through in my life. And to come late, behind the eight ball already, I tried so hard not to over try. But when you come in late you want to just be a factor to your team so much. And sometimes you've got to let the game come to you without forcing it."
 Reed, who played in all of the final 10 games of the regular season, finished with just two sacks and eight quaterback hits (though one forced one of the biggest plays of the season, the forced fumble that was returned for a touchdown by Jadeveon Clowney that sparked Seattle's comeback win at San Francisco).
 "I've just got a bounce back," Reed said. "That year is behind me now. That was then. And I'm in way better shape than what I was. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to get this fresh start and start this season with a clean slate. I'm just excited for this season because I worked really hard and I'm not gonna let none of these guys down."
 At one point Tuesday, Reed said his return to Seattle -- which selected him in the second round of the 2016 draft out of Alabama -- was also about settling "unfinished business."
 "I just didn't want to leave on that note," he said. "The way the season went, and especially the way it went for me personally, I just did not want to go out like that, basically, with a bad taste in my mouth."

"articleBody" : "'Mookkutthi Amman', a devotional film which was scheduled to be released in May featured Nayanthara in the lead. With the pandemic throwing the film industry affairs into a tailspin, the next best option for the film is to get featured on OTT platform. Already, a dozen films have been either screened or await a screening slot on the Net since May this year. Nayanthara, who commands a market independently was recently in the news taking a private jet to visit her mother in Kerala during the Onam festival. She had her beau Vignesh Sivan, with whom her marriage is about to be finalized anytime soon. As many of her contemporaries failed to impress the audience, beginning with her contemporary Jyothika and her junior and fellow Keralite, Keerthy Suresh, people would wait and watch how the 'lady Superstar' of southern cinema would fare if her film takes the digital route. Directed by R J Balaji, the film is produced by Ishari K Ganesh and rests itself solely on the star appeal of Nayanthara. Of course, the last few releases of the star have been well accepted and have also been dubbed and released in neighbouring territories also, which is what would keep the market enthused. ",

 Navalny, a politician and corruption investigator who is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critics, fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on Aug 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk after the plane made an emergency landing.
 He was later transferred to Berlin’s Charite hospital, where doctors last week said there were indications that he had been poisoned.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in a statement Wednesday that testing by a special German military laboratory had shown proof of “a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group.”
 Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent, was used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain. It is a cholinesterase inhibitor, part of the class of substances that doctors at the Charite initially identied in Navalny.

We believe we have the best way, the most advanced way, and the quickest way to get to fault tolerance. If that’s true based on that premise, then photonics is really the best way to go, and then having access to our cloud therefore is the best way to go as well.”

When COVID-19 vaccines become available, health providers will need to track where and when patients receive their vaccines, said Moore, the medical director of Tennessee's immunization plan during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and 2010. And with many different shots in the works, they will need to know exactly which one each patient got, she said.

When COVID-19 vaccines become available, health providers will need to track where and when patients receive their vaccines, said Moore, the medical director of Tennessee’s immunization plan during the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and 2010. And with many different shots in the works, they will need to know exactly which one each patient got, she said.
 People will need to receive their second COVID-19 dose 21 or 28 days after the first, so health providers will need to remind patients to receive their second shot, Moore said, and ensure that the second dose is the same brand as the first.
 The CDC will require vaccinators to provide “ dose-level accounting and reporting” for immunizations, so that the agency knows where every dose of COVID-19 vaccine is “at any point in time,” Moore said. Although “the sophistication of these systems has improved dramatically” in the past decade, she said, “many states will still face major challenges meeting data tracking and reporting expectations.”
 The CDC is developing an app called the Vaccine Administration Monitoring System for health departments whose data systems don’t meet standards for COVID-19 response, said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, a nonprofit based in Rockville, Maryland.
 “Those standards haven’t been released,” Hannan said, “so health departments are waiting to invest in necessary IT enhancements.″ The CDC needs to release standards and data expectations as quickly as possible, she added.
 Meanwhile, health departments are dealing with what Minnesota’s Ehresmann described as “legacy” vaccine registries, sometimes dating to the late 1980s.

Commenting on the performance, Hemant Sikka, President, Farm Equipment Sector, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. said, " _We have sold 23,503 tractors in the domestic market during August 2020, a growth of 69% over last year. On the back of highest ever sales in July, we have clocked yet another highest ever sales in August. The Tractor industry growth continues to remain strong in August. This is primarily on account of continued positive sentiment, due to increase in Kharif sowing area, thereby indicating a bumper harvest, bountiful monsoon, good rural cash flows and base effect. We expect rural sentiments to remain positive and translate into robust tractor demand as we move into the festive period. In the exports market, we have sold 955 tractors, a growth of 1% over last year._ "

Parents know this, even the many who are worried enough about the safety of the public schools to favor delays. But some families are better placed to insulate themselves from the possibility that the public schools will fail — and many have already taken the necessary steps. Parents with the time, financial resources, and educational capital are forming learning pods, shifting to home-schooling, enrolling children in private schools that promise in-person instruction — whatever they need to do to provide a robust education for their children. The failure of the public schools to get their act together is driving even very liberal parents around the bend. Where will they ultimately land?

Warped Wing Brewing Co. has opened its new barrel-aging facility, pilot brewery and restaurant in Springboro.
   
 The 20,000-square-foot Warped Wing Barrel Room & Smokery opened Saturday (Aug. 29) and includes an outdoor beer garden. The facility has enough space to hold more than 400 barrels, along with serving as a brewery and distribution hub.
   
 The Dayton-based Warped Wing also is launching special customer program such as a Barrel Club Reserve membership which will allow people to get hands-on tours, exclusive tastings and first offers for limited bottles.
   
 "Our barrel-aging program has propelled us into an interesting place," cofounder Nick Bowman said in a prepared statement. "My partner, cofounder and brewmaster John Haggerty has a wealth of knowledge and experience with brewing and barrel aging. He pushes the creativity of recipe development to another level. Barrel aging is an intimate and patient process. A lot of our beers rest in wood for up to a year or longer. We are excited to share this process and experience with our customers. The Barrel Room & Smokery will take beer to a new level and will change the way people perceive and interact with beer. That is what I'm most excited about."
   
 The pilot brewing system also will allow Warped Wing to experiment, he added.
   
 The Smokery, run by Culinary Director Erin O 'Neill, will focus on smoked meat/food items and many of the dishes will feature Warped Wing beers as ingredients, the brewery said.
   
 The new brewery will be open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday; 11 a.m. to midnight Friday and Saturday; and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday.

Aid agencies have called on Greek authorities to investigate press reports of alleged pushbacks at sea. Greek officials, including Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, have vehemently denied the coast guard engages in the practice, whereby those arriving inside a nation's territorial waters would be summarily returned without being given the chance to apply for asylum.

JBL has doubled down on its true wireless in-ears range, throwing in active noise-cancelling technology while introducing new models. The JBL Live Free NC+ headphones are the ones to look out for, and aside from noise-cancellation their other notable feature is the Dual Connect + Sync technology, which links the left and right buds independently to the user's source device the minute the charge case is opened. That should not only improve latency between the buds but it also means that one can…

He would not elaborate on how the boats were prevented from entering Greek waters, which also mark the southeastern border of the European Union.

Nonetheless, Germany, like many other countries, understood that if they truly prioritized reopening — as I agree they should have — that meant prioritizing the steps that would make reopening possible. While taking the necessary steps is expensive, an administration that did the proper planning would be in a much better position to go begging in Albany or Washington for greater fiscal support than an administration that didn't even start planning to use outdoor space for classes until late in the summer. And while teachers were always going to be nervous, it's not like the city had to confirm their worst fears with outrageous shenanigans like asking teachers to certify the adequacy of ventilation systems (hardly their area of expertise), and then seeming to bureaucratically bury any notices of problems. It's hard to ask teachers to step up and take risks when the government has done so little to bolster their confidence.

All in all, attempting to deflect liability by forcing students to sign waivers strikes me as ill-advised for colleges and universities. The optics of having students sign liability waivers are not good, to say the least. It makes colleges and universities seem like they are more concerned with resuming in-person instruction and reopening their dorms than they are about the health, welfare and safety of their students.
