SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Top-seeded North Dakota State led from start to finish and overwhelmed No. 6 North Dakota 89-53 in the Summit League Tournament championship game on Tuesday night and secured the automatic NCAA Tournament bid.
 NDSU’s leading scorer, Vinnie Shahid, led the Bison with 25 points on 8-of-14 shooting. Shahid entered the game averaging 18.2 points per game, but he blew by that early in the second half. Tyson Ward scored 15 of his 23 points in the second half for the Bison.
 NDSU (25-8) raced to a 13-0 lead and had North Dakota down 21-2 in the first eight minutes of the game. The Bison continued to pour it on in the first half, building the lead to as many as 27 points at the break.

Sessions is seeking a return to the Senate seat he held safely for 20 years before stepping down to become Trump's first attorney general. Sessions resigned as attorney general after their relationship soured over his recusal in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Sessions said he was bound by Department of Justice regulation to resign because he played a role in Trump's 2016 campaign.
 Tuberville responded to Trump in a tweet that he is, “looking forward to helping you drain the swamp and (Keep America Great.)"
 The Sessions campaign did not immediately respond to a text message seeking comment.

“We’re working on (a coronavirus response) on a regular basis with our health experts at the Health Sciences campus and with the governor’s office,” Harroz said. “We will have regular updates.”
 The regents approved the appointment of John Klier as the new dean of the Gallogly College of Engineering, while also approving personal decisions which included paid leave for Tom Orr, a professor in OU’s Helmerich School of Drama. Orr was investigated by OU Title IX in 2018, and was placed on administrative leave in January “in light of recent allegations.”
 Following an hour-and-a-half executive session, the regents elected Regent and former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating — who was absent for a majority of the day’s meetings — as the board’s vice-chair. Keating will serve alongside Regent Gary Pierson, who was selected as the new chair effective in March during the regents’ October 2019 meeting.
 Although Rainbolt objected and Pierson joked she “threatened (him) with physical violence,” the regents passed a motion in honor of Rainbolt’s 14 years of service on the Board of Regents, which drew applause from many attendees.
 “Thank you for caring deeply for all the students, faculty and staff who have passed through here,” Pierson said. “We appreciate you, and the university and state of Oklahoma appreciate you.”
 After the meeting adjourned, Pierson said the regents are well-prepared to move forward following Rainbolt’s departure.
 “The Board of Regents has been preparing for this transition for a couple of months … there are a number of things happening on a number of different fronts,” Pierson said. “I’m terribly excited and honored for this position. OU’s in a good spot. We’ve come through some rough times recently but I have high hopes for the future.”
 Pierson said he was optimistic about the “outstanding faculty” OU has hired in recent months, the record-number of freshmen in the university’s most recent class and OU’s improved finances.
 “There’s dozens of things all across the campus that are working beautifully with the right people, and we’re proud of all that,” Pierson said. “Do we have work to do? You bet — but that’s always true for an institution that lives before and after its temporary governors.”
 The future search for a permanent university president is “not on the backburner,” Pierson said, but official considerations for candidates had not yet begun.
 “The arrangement we made with interim President Harroz was that no search would begin until after 15 months starting last June,” Pierson said, “that clock has not run yet … but we’ll address that in due course.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden decisively won Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday, seizing a key battleground state that helped propel Bernie Sanders’ insurgent candidacy four years ago. The former vice president's victory there, as well as in Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho, dealt a serious blow to Sanders and substantially widened Biden's path to the nomination. Biden again showed strength with working-class voters and African Americans, who are vital to winning the Democratic nomination. Sanders' narrow hopes for good news rested on North Dakota and Washington state. Washington's primary was too early to call, and because all votes there are cast by mail or by dropping them off in a ballot box, many ballots were marked for candidates who have since dropped out of the race. The six-state contest marked the first time voters weighed in on the primary since it effectively narrowed to a two- person race between Sanders and Biden. And the first four states on Tuesday went to Biden, a dramatic reversal for a campaign that appeared on the brink of collapse just two weeks ago. Now it is Sanders, whose candidacy was ascendant so recently, who must contemplate a path forward. Addressing supporters in Philadelphia, Biden noted that many had “declared that this candidacy was dead” only days ago, but “now we're very much alive.” He also asked Sanders supporters to back him going forward. “We need you, we want you, and there’s a place in our campaign for each of you. I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,” Biden said. \"We share a common goal, and together we’ll beat Donald Trump.” It marked a high point for the former vice president's staff. They sipped beer and broke into an impromptu dance party after his speech, which was held...

quot;I don't think anyone would resist to such a situation.&quot; Spurs produced a remarkable fightback from 3-0 down on aggregate away at Ajax in last season's semi-finals to make the final for the first time in the club's history thanks to Lucas Moura's hat-trick.


--DocBreak--
Leipzig (Germany), Mar 11 (AFP) Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli questioned his side's mental strength after RB Leipzig cruised to a 3-0 win on Tuesday to progress 4-0 on aggregate to the quarter-finals for the first time.
 Leipzig captain Marcel Sabitzer struck twice in the first 21 minutes before substitute Emil Forsberg added the third late on with his first touch.
 "We were second to a lot of balls. To concede them goals shows our mentality wasn't strong enough," added Alli.
 "We had to show maturity and fight and we didn't do that and we were punished."
 Unlike many fixtures across Europe this week, there were no restrictions on supporters attending due to the spread of coronavirus and the Leipzig fans were able to enjoy a nerve-free evening.
 Spurs travelled to eastern Germany shorn of striking options without the injured Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Steven Bergwijn.
 However, it was at the other end that they buckled inside the opening quarter of the game as two errors from goalkeeper Hugo Lloris turned a tough task into an impossible one.
 Leipzig took just 10 minutes to open the scoring when Lloris did not get a strong enough right hand to stop Sabitzer's strike from outside the box finding the bottom corner.
 Timo Werner then fired home from close range only to be denied by the offside flag as Leipzig opened up the Tottenham defence at will.
 And the visitors did not learn their lesson as Sabitzer met Angelino's cross with a powerful header, but Lloris should still have done better to keep the ball out at his near post.
 Tottenham have now failed to win their last six games in all competitions -- the longest winless streak of Jose Mourinho's managerial career.
 And the Portuguese again blamed that run on his lack of options due to an injury list that also includes Moussa Sissoko, Davinson Sanchez and Ben Davies.
 "People can say excuses but I'm pretty sure it is bad for anyone," said Mourinho.
 "I don't think anyone would resist to such a situation." Spurs produced a remarkable fightback from 3-0 down on aggregate away at Ajax in last season's semi-finals to make the final for the first time in the club's history thanks to Lucas Moura's hat-trick.
 But in keeping with their collapse since that night in Amsterdam last May, Mourinho's men lacked the quality and belief needed to reproduce that thrilling fightback.
 Forsberg took just 32 seconds after replacing Sabitzer to fire the third goal into the far corner three minutes from time.
 "It's a great moment for the history of the club, for me as a manager, and for my young team," said Leipzig's 32-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann.
 "It's totally deserved we go to the next round. We were the better team, scored four goals, conceded none, so we are very happy."
 Tottenham's season now hinges on refinding their domestic form if they are not to miss out on the Champions League next season for the first time in five years.
 Spurs are eighth in the Premier League, seven points adrift of the top four, and in desperate need for Mourinho to exact revenge on Manchester United for his sacking last season when the Red Devils visit north London on Sunday.
 "We know this hasn't been a good season but we can't hide," added Alli.
 "Confidence is gone at the minute but we have a big game at the weekend and we have to pick ourselves up and go again." (AFP)

WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden has delivered decisive wins in Missouri and Mississippi, dealing an early blow to Bernie Sanders on a night when six states were up for grabs.
 Both men were focused intensely on Michigan, Tuesday's biggest prize.

It's also where President Donald Trump's victory four years was so narrow that Democrats are desperate to show they have the strength to flip it back.
 Beyond Michigan, Sanders could get a boost in Idaho, North Dakota or Washington state. Polls there haven't yet closed.

Arsenal's game at Manchester City was postponed on Wednesday after players from the London club were put into quarantine, making it the first Premier League fixture to be called off because of the new coronavirus. Arsenal said players will be isolated for 14 days after coming into contact with the owner of Greek club Olympiakos, who has tested positive for COVID-19. "We are strictly following the government guidelines which recommend that anyone coming into close contact with someone with the virus should self-isolate at home for 14 days from the last time they had contact," an Arsenal statement said.
 "As a result, the players are unavailable for tonight's (Wednesday's) match against Manchester City and the Premier League has decided the game should be postponed."
 The first postponement in the Premier League, which has a worldwide following of billions of TV viewers, comes after UEFA's Champions League and Europa League were both forced to arrange matches behind closed doors.
 Football's top-flight Serie A and all other sports have been put on hold in Italy, which is under national lockdown as virus cases soar.
 Matches in the top two divisions in Spain and France will be played behind closed doors for at least the next two weeks, officials announced Tuesday.
 In Asia, football has been suspended in China, South Korea and Japan, and the AFC Champions League schedule heavily disrupted.
 Arsenal were knocked out of the Europa League by Olympiakos in late February. Vangelis Marinakis, owner of the Greek club and England's Nottingham Forest, announced on Tuesday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus.
 Arsenal said the players and four staff who met Marinakis after the game at their stadium will be remain at their homes until the quarantine period is complete.
 "The medical advice we have received puts the risk of them developing Covid-19 at extremely low," the club added.
 Manchester City said the postponement was a "precautionary measure" and that information about rescheduling would be available in the coming days.
 The postponement could also frustrate Premier League leaders Liverpool as a Manchester City defeat would have taken them to the brink of their first top- flight title in 30 years.
 Olympiakos's home Europa League last-16, first-leg game against Wolverhampton Wanderers in Athens has already been ordered behind closed doors.
 Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo on Tuesday joined a number of managers, including Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp, in voicing disquiet at being asked to playing in an empty stadium.
 "If we have to go we will. But we don't agree -- we're not happy to go," he told Sky Sports.
 "Behind closed doors doesn't make sense," he added. "We're pretending to live a normal life when things aren't normal."
