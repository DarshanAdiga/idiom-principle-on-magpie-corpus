China also reported a reduction in stroke activity during the pandemic, and one study has shown that some Chinese patients delayed presenting to hospital with stroke symptoms. We shouldn’t jump to conclusions, but this suggests it’s possible that stroke victims in the UK avoided hospitals when the pandemic was at its worst. Equally, we can’t yet rule out other factors influencing China’s lower rate of stroke admissions either.

One person has died and eight others have been injured in a collision between four vehicles on the R24 in Tarlton, according to Gauteng paramedics.
 Paramedics arrived on the scene shortly after 20:30 on Friday and found multiple victims, ER24 spokesperson Ineke van Huyssteen said.
 "Upon further assessment, they found a man, seated in the driver's seat of the one vehicle, showing no signs of life."
 The man was declared dead at the scene.
 Three other people were found to have sustained serious injuries, Van Huyssteen said.
 "Two of these people were trapped inside vehicles and the West Rand fire department had to extract them using the jaws of life," she said.
 The injured were airlifted to hospital in a medical helicopter. Five others sustained injuries, ranging from minor to moderate.
 They were treated on the scene before being transported to hospital.
 The exact circumstances around the incident were not known, but police were on the scene for investigations.

With Zimbabwe's coronavirus infections on the decline, schools are reopening, along with churches, bars, restaurants, airports and tourist attractions. Strict lockdowns designed to curb the disease are being replaced by a return to relatively normal life.
 The threat has eased so much that many people see no need to be cautious. With his face mask stuffed into his pocket, Omega Chibanda said he's not worried about Covid-19.
 "We used to fear coronavirus, not anymore," the 16-year-old said in the crowded Chitungwiza town on the outskirts of the capital, Harare. "That's why I'm not even wearing a mask."
 As the global death toll from Covid-19 approaches 1 million, Zimbabwe and several other African countries have not experienced the widespread surges and many deaths that were predicted. That has invited complacency.
   
   
 "It's all relaxed now," Chibanda said.
 Earlier this month, Zimbabwe went a week without recording any deaths from coronavirus, and new infections and deaths have declined, as in South Africa and Kenya.
 Africa's surge has been leveling off, with its 1.4 million confirmed cases increasing relatively slowly. Antibody testing is expected to show many more infections, but most cases are asymptomatic. Just over 35,000 deaths have been confirmed on the continent of 1.3 billion people.
 But the improving figures and the start of the searing heat of the Southern Hemisphere's summer could undermine efforts to beat back the virus even further, said community health worker Rosemary Rambire.
 She leaves home early in the morning and returns in the evening after going door to door calling "the gospel is here" and gathering families for quick awareness sessions.
 "Our job is now harder to do because people are no longer afraid," Rambire said. "Some even tell us that it has not killed anyone they know. Most of them say the sun kills Covid-19 so they have no reason to worry."
 Some think they are immune once they eat garlic, ginger and onions, she said.
 In her 14 years on the job and through multiple disease outbreaks, Covid-19 has been the most difficult to get people to take preventive measures, she said.
 "It's different from before, when we did campaigns on cholera (and) HIV. We could tell that people were afraid. They tried to follow preventive measures," she said. "With Covid-19, they are not afraid."
 Many people look at the infection and death figures in Zimbabwe, compare them with other countries "and conclude that it only affects other countries and not Zimbabwe," Rambire added.
 In Chitungwiza, a sprawling working-class center on the southern edge of Harare, people no longer wear masks at markets, funerals or other public events. Masks are now the exception in many of Harare's poor residential areas.
 "We have lost both the initial Covid-19 fear factor and the motivation to comply with national guidelines," said Aaron Sundsmo, of the charitable organization Mercy Corps. The group has now enlisted local soccer, music and film celebrities to renew awareness.
 The government will "not hesitate to do something really strict" to curb any creeping complacency, said Dr. Agnes Mahomva, the chief Covid-19 response coordinator in Zimbabwe.
 "The dire projections that 'Africa, you are going to be toast,' perhaps actually helped us. We tightened up," she said.
 Continued vigilance should accompany Africa's apparent success story, said Mervyn Joullie, deputy regional director for Africa at Mercy Corps, which operates in 16 of Africa's 54 countries.
 Limited testing in many African countries makes it difficult to assess "the reality of Covid-19 situation," Joullie said.
 In West Africa's Sahel region, for example, positive cases of Covid-19 have declined over the past several weeks amid low testing capacity, which could suggest "a significant presence of undetected cases," Joullie said.
 Health experts point to Africa's youthful population as a factor in why Covid-19 has not taken a larger toll, along with swift lockdowns and the later arrival of the virus.
 Many African countries have eased the lockdowns and curfews in recent weeks to boost economies battered by the virus outbreak and, in some cases, ease local political pressure.
 Balancing concerns about unemployment, security and access to food, as well as the complacency and the need to keep infections low could be Africa's next big challenge, experts said.
 "We are at a crossroads as we relax some of the restrictions," said Dr. Mahomva, Zimbabwe's Covid-19 response coordinator. "It's not over until it's over."
 But for Chibanda, the teenager in Chitungwiza, there is no such dilemma.
 "Coronavirus is not an issue anymore here," he said, pointing to people walking on the street without masks. "Just look around."

Future moon explorers will be bombarded with two to three times more radiation than astronauts aboard the International Space Station, a health hazard that will require thick-walled shelters for protection, scientists reported on Friday.China's lander on the far side of the moon is providing the first full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, vital information for NASA and others aiming to send astronauts to the moon, the study noted.A Chinese-German team reported on the radiation data collected by the lander -- named Chang'e 4 for the Chinese moon goddess -- in the US journal Science Advances."This is an immense achievement in the sense that now we have a data set which we can use to benchmark our radiation" and better understand the potential risk to people on the moon, said Thomas Berger, a physicist with the German Space Agency's medicine institute.Astronauts would get 200 to 1,000 times more radiation on the moon than what we experience on Earth -- or five to 10 times more than passengers on a trans-Atlantic airline flight, noted Robert Wimmer-Schweingruber of Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel, Germany."The difference is, however, that we're not on such a flight for as long as astronauts would be when they're exploring the moon," Wimmer-Schweingruber said in an email.Cancer is the primary risk."Humans are not really made for these radiation levels and should protect themselves when on the moon," he added.Radiation levels should be pretty much the same all over the moon, except for near the walls of deep craters, Wimmer-Schweingruber said."Basically, the less you see of the sky, the better. That's the primary source of the radiation," he said.Wimmer- Schweingruber said the radiation levels are close to what models had predicted. The levels measured by Chang'e 4, in fact, "agree nearly exactly" with measurements by a detector on a NASA orbiter that has been circling the moon for more than a decade, said Kerry Lee, a space radiation expert at Johnson Space Centre in Houston."It is nice to see confirmation of what we think and our understanding of how radiation interacts with the moon is as expected," said Lee, who was not involved in the Chinese-led study. In a detailed outline released this week, NASA said the first pair of astronauts to land on the moon under the new Artemis program would spend about a week on the lunar surface, more than twice as long as the Apollo crews did a half-century ago. Expeditions would last one to two months once a base camp is established. NASA is looking to put astronauts on the moon by the end of 2024, an accelerated pace ordered by the White House, and on Mars sometime in the 2030s. The space agency said it will have radiation detectors and a safe shelter aboard all Orion crew capsules flying to the moon. As for the actual landers, three separate corporate teams are developing their own craft with NASA oversight. For the first Artemis moon landing, at least, the astronauts will live in the ascent portion of their lander. The German researchers suggest shelters built of moon dirt -- readily available material -- for stays of more than a few days. The walls should be 80 centimeters (about 2 1/2 feet) thick, they said. Any thicker and the dirt will emit its own secondary radiation, created when galactic cosmic rays interact with the lunar soil. "So in this sense -- I think the walls of European Castles would be too thick!" Berger wrote in an email.

The company is expected to unveil the excess debt when it releases its April- June earnings on Wednesday, the sources said.
 Leopalace21 is believed to have enough funds to keep operating for a while. As of the end of March, it had about ¥60 billion in cash and deposits.
 But the company could find it difficult to take on fresh bank loans if it fails to resolve the negative net worth soon, the sources said.
 Although Leopalace21 is taking restructuring measures, such as seeking the voluntary retirement of about 1,000 employees, a swift recovery appears difficult, making it necessary for the firm to find a sponsor to support its business reconstruction as soon as possible.
 Leopalace21 incurred a group net loss of ¥80.2 billion in fiscal 2019, which ended in March this year, staying in the red for the second straight year. The company expects to remain in the red in the current year.

Russia has been given five more months to fix a “seriously deficient” plan to combat doping in track and field, World Athletics said Saturday. Track's world governing body said Russia's deadline was moved from Sept. 30 to March 1. A World Athletics task force reported the Russian track federation, known as RusAF, had so few experienced staff that it couldn't compose an adequate road map for lifting a doping suspension which has been in place nearly five years. “Although the draft plan was better than what has come before (in particular, in acknowledging the doping culture in Russian athletics, and in identifying some of the systemic issues that have to be addressed to change that culture), it is nevertheless seriously deficient and does not meet most of the requirements,” the task force said in a statement. The task force \"could not possibly provide feedback that would facilitate turning this product into an acceptable plan by the end of September unless we took on the job of rewriting it ourselves, when our job is supposed to be only the provision of advice and feedback on what they come up with based on their own analysis of the situation.\" World Athletics had previously said RusAF could be expelled from membership if it didn't compose an anti-doping plan. RusAF handed in a draft plan last month and was meant to modify it by Sept. 30 to include changes required by World Athletics. The task force said a “void” of experience in senior management hampered the work. The then-president Dmitry Shlyakhtin was among five RusAF employees or board members who were suspended last year over allegations of providing forged documents to give an athlete an alibi for being unavailable for doping testing. Long-running financial problems have made it hard for RusAF to attract and retain staff. RusAF is due to elect a...

Hunter received an Emmy nod for the role and won the trophy for a pair of other TV movies, 1993's "The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom" and 1989's "Roe vs. Wade."
 "In a way, the greatest thing I got out of playing Billie was Billie as a friend," Hunter said. It also made playing her more difficult, "because I was afraid I was going to completely screw her up."
 She is also "steadfast friends" with Susan Zirinsky, the inspiration for the driven TV news producer in 1987's "Broadcast News." Hunter said she and the journalist, who was an associate producer on the film, became close after it was made.
 "I was at such a different place in my career, which is to say at the beginning," Hunter recalled. "I wasn't worried about offending Susan or not bringing Susan to life. I was just worried about myself. I was worried about, like, `Wow, am I actually going to be able to do this'?"
 The film earned seven Oscar nominations, including one for Hunter.
 In 2019, Zirinksy became the first female president of CBS News, and Hunter surprised her at a party with a one-of-a-kind congratulatory gift: A silver plaque from "Broadcast News" given to Hunter's character, Jane Craig, after she was promoted to Washington bureau chief.
 "She just completely lost it," Hunter said of Zirinsky.
 "The Comey Rule," originally set to air after the Nov. 3 general election, was moved up after creator Ray expressed disappointment about the post-election timing in a letter that became public.
 Hunter said she can't predict how "The Comey Rule" might be received in these polarized times. She's a Democrat who calls herself "defiantly anti-Trump," but isn't politically active and said she prefers to keep a low profile in every regard.
 "I think it's my profession. I like being an actress and being somewhat of a blank slate," she said. "I have never, ever talked about my personal life. It's just not my thing."

DEAR ABBY: I feel uncomfortable receiving gifts, and I find it hard to meet my husband’s requests for constant gifts, especially when I feel I already give so much. He constantly asks me to buy him things, some of which are very expensive.
 I’m a saver, not a spender, and I try to watch my budget. I already pay all the household bills, even though we make the same amount of money. I owned my house before we met, and he chips in with occasional upgrades and maintenance or takes me out to dinner once in a while. But I pay for the vast majority of expenses, as well as perform the majority of chores. I have sacrificed and paid for all our vacations because I wanted the experience, and I accept that.
 The problem is, he seems to feel unappreciated, suggesting that if I gifted him more often, he would know he was constantly thought of. He says he buys me random gifts — usually small items to which there are strings attached or implied reciprocity. These requests, especially when he buys for himself quite a bit, seem like a smack in the face to me. I feel he’s impulsive with purchases and won’t be happy until I have nothing left.

The pace has been frenzied even by the standards of the busiest year on record, 2005. That season didn’t make it to its 23rd tropical or subtropical storm until Oct. 22. This year, that happened more than a month sooner, on Sept. 18. That was also the only day in history on which the Hurricane Center has named three storms (Wilfred, Alpha and Beta).
 While forecasters scramble to keep up, researchers are puzzling over what’s made 2020 such a banner year.
 One of the most obvious culprits is La Niña, whose arrival was confirmed by NOAA on Sept. 10. La Niña, a semi-regular cooling of the eastern tropical Pacific, tends to reduce the wind shear that can impede Atlantic hurricane formation. A La Niña is only present about every third hurricane season, though — so by itself, it doesn’t fully explain why 2020 is so extraordinarily active.
 Sizzling oceans, supercharged by climate change, may be an even bigger factor. Most of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic, including the Gulf of Mexico, has run warmer than average through the season, with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) at or near record values in some areas.
 Unusually warm waters extended up the U.S. East Coast as Hurricane Isaias plowed northward, leaving in its wake an estimated $5 billion in damage and 15 deaths. Likewise, Hurricane Laura traversed warmer-than-usual SSTs en route to a destructive landfall in southwest Louisiana, where at least 33 deaths and some $10 billion in damage were tallied.
 “Certainly, the SST pattern we’ve had over the past 30 days screams ‘active season!’” said hurricane forecaster Philip Klotzbach of Colorado State University in an email.
 Thus far in 2020, two named storms, Laura and Teddy, have hit major-hurricane status, both Category 4. Two others, Paulette and Sally, came close to Category 3 strength.
 By comparison, the Atlantic spawned five major hurricanes by the end of September 2005. Three of those, Katrina and Rita, hit Category 5, and both of them struck the U.S. Gulf Coast. Katrina alone caused as many as 1,800 U.S. deaths and $125 billion in damage. Even the less destructive Rita led to more U.S. fatalities and damage than the entire 2020 Atlantic season thus far.
 Why has this season so far been more prolific yet less catastrophic than 2005? One reason is the randomness of landfall geography. For example, the storm surge from Hurricane Laura could have been much more devastating if it had hit 100 miles to the east or west, striking New Orleans or Houston, rather than just missing Lake Charles.
 Another factor: tropical waves coming off Africa, though plentiful, have struggled to intensify in the tropical Atlantic’s Main Development Region (MDR), where many of the most dangerous U.S. hurricanes get their start. All but one of this year’s hurricanes became hurricanes outside the MDR.
 Some of this year’s plentiful tropical waves got caught up in large monsoon- type circulations in the MDR that impeded development. Others struggled when they reached a persistent zone of low pressure at high altitudes just east of the Lesser Antilles, which generated hostile winds.
 Meanwhile, from May through July, a string of weaker named storms popped up at higher latitudes. According to hurricane researcher Falko Judt at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, most of these originated from upper-level low-pressure systems or weakening cold fronts rather than tropical waves, and the conditions weren’t ideal for growth.
 “These kinds of storms develop in marginally favorable environments, so there’s usually quite a bit of shear and dry air. The waters aren’t as warm as farther south, either,” Judt said in an email.
 Even these weaker, higher-latitude storms have been attention grabbers, in part because several have struck U.S. shores.

Sports fans can get accustomed to anything, and some of the new norms are preferable to the old ones.
 After a couple of months of watching the rebooted sports world play out, here are four things I hope to see in 2021.
 1\. The NBA schedule moving to summer
 The 2020-21 NBA season tentatively was scheduled to begin around Dec. 1, though Commissioner Adam Silver told Bob Costas on Tuesday that his “best guess” is it won’t start before January. A January start would be about a 2½-month delay from the NBA’s mid-October starting date for the 2019-20 season.
 After watching this year’s playoffs, which began in mid-August and will run through mid-October, I’m more convinced than ever that moving the regular season from a fall-winter schedule to a spring-summer schedule is the way to go.
 A perfect opening night would be Feb. 9, a couple of days after the Feb. 7 Super Bowl in Tampa, Fla. The regular season would go through the end of July, with the playoffs running from the first week of August through early October.
 Yes, that means the NBA would go head to head with the baseball season, which has had the summer to itself for eons until the pandemic. Truthfully, baseball could benefit from the competition, and as we learned the hard way in March and April, you can never have too many sports-watching options.

But the same cannot be said for the rest of the casting. Kingsley Ben-Adir as Obama is jarring both in appearance and speech, and Joe Lo Truglio as Jeff Sessions leaves much to be desired (fans of _Grey's Anatomy,_ keep your eyes peeled for a surprise).
 Many iconic scenes have been recreated, with pointed dialogues to help us discern Daniels’ one beatific smile from another. In the famous White House greeting incident, for instance, director-writer Billy Ray lingers on Daniels’s attempts to blend into the White House curtains before he is called up to greet the new President. “That’s his ‘Oh, shit!’ face,” says his wife Patrice (Jennifer Ehle), as Daniels walks over and shakes hands with Gleeson.
 As far as political dramas go, _The Comey Rule_ checks all almost all boxes. It attempts to provide context to the headlines that dominated U.S. politics for over a year, and is untiring in its efforts to portray Comey as a morally- upright bureaucrat who believed that America’s norms of checks and balances would stand in the way of a President who has little regard for either. Much like Comey’s decisions, this two-part series too is unlikely to satisfy viewers on either side of the political spectrum. To Democrats, Comey’s justifications may be too little too late. I can’t imagine Republicans being thrilled with the depiction of Trump and his cohorts either.
 So what exactly is _The Comey Rule_? An attempt to provide context to headlines? A stab at redemption for James Comey's decisions? A love-letter to the FBI, or an ode to the institutional pillars that hold up the American democracy? The choice lies with the viewer.
  _The Comey Rule will premiere on 27 September on Voot Select and will air on Zee Cafe in November_

Visceral aversion also plays a role in the slow adoption of consumer-facing robots. In contrast to AI software running silently in the background, a robot is a physical object invading your personal comfort zone and raising primal alarm bells. This sentiment is echoed by the viral response to the Boston Dynamics product demos of eerily dog-like robots, which were received online as harbingers of the looming robot apocalypse. While we feel comfortable handing over our most private data to AI engines on a near-constant basis, the most sophisticated robot most people will welcome into their homes is a Roomba.
 Finally, consumer-facing robots threaten to replace manual and service jobs, raising fears of mass unemployment. This concern — an understandable one, considering the current 10.2 percent unemployment rate — could make regulation stricter and suppress investment appetite.
 But the unemployment argument against robotics is Luddite in nature — history teaches us that it rarely wins. From the original Luddite movement in 19th century England, when workers rallied against textile machinery, to the Soviet Union’s early denouncement of genetics and cybernetics, we see that efficient technology usually ends up being implemented. Labor markets adapt in response. In the long term, automation creates new employment opportunities by reducing product prices and creating new industries.
 When human contact is risky, the argument for public-facing robots is straightforward. An autonomous, self-disinfecting vehicle can transport front- line workers when mass transit is unsafe. Home base units with robotic capabilities can expand the functionality of telemedicine, transforming it from a glorified Zoom chat to a platform for remote delivery of therapeutics or diagnostics. Robotic assistants at hospitals and nursing homes can reduce the risk of exposure in environments that have seen more than 40 percent of all COVID-19 fatalities. Companies such as Waymo and UVD are already exploring some of these ideas. Many can be readily implemented using existing technology.
 And it’s not too late for robots to make an impact. Early forecasts predicted that the virus would disappear within a few months. Multiple experts today predict we will have to coexist with the coronavirus for years to come. Besides, antibiotic-resistant bacterial outbreaks, environmental disasters and new pandemics are likely to emerge in the future. At a time where most of the tools to fight the outbreak are decidedly low-tech, robotic solutions to address future disruptions deserve a second look. The same robotic tools would bring further benefits to the post-pandemic economy, improving public safety in a variety of sectors and generating a boost in productivity.
 What can be done to hasten the consumer-facing robotic revolution? Targeted federal funding with a focus on civilian applications is a good start. While the Department of Defense’s investment in AI technologies amounts to $2 billion, the nonmilitary National Robotics Initiative budget is a comparatively minuscule $50 million. Streamlined regulation is another key to this process, addressing public concerns about robotic safety and broader impact on the job market without hampering innovation. Finally, workforce retraining is key. If we focus on workforce development and prioritize applications that offer broad societal benefits, our robotic overlords may end up being benevolent after all.

Six months after bill Maguire's bullet-riddled, dismembered body washed up in suitcases on Virginia Beach, investigators turned their attention to New Jersey where he and his wife had last lived and he was last seen alive. The task force had local police, state police, the attorney general's office. They decided to treat this case with top priority. Police searched for a record of the gun used in bill's murder, turns up, a purchase made by Melanie in Pennsylvania. Because bill Maguire had a felony conviction stemming from his horrendous driving record, he was barred from purchasing firearms. You say your husband asked you to purchase the gun. But you purchased the gun just two days before your husband went missing. Of course it's a coincidence. He was on me for a while about that. If he was in some sort of trouble, that may very well been the reason why he was so intent on getting it. As police hone in on Melanie, they begin wiretapping her phones, discovering her affair, providing a possible motive for the murder. Eager to prove his innocence, Dr. Miller agrees to wear a wire. You swear you had nothing to do with this? Yes. On your children's lives? Because I'm standing by you. Yes. Investigators also focus on Melanie's highway toll records, trying to track her movements in the days surrounding bill's disappearance. On April 30, 2004, the day after the couple's alleged fight and the day Melanie filed for a restraining order, she says she goes to Atlantic City looking for bill's car. Absolutely not rational, but get in the car and go down there. And lo and behold, there it is. She decides she's going to move his car. Melanie says in the past, when they're angry at each other, it's a way of messing with each other I guess you could say. We believe she was planting his car in Atlantic City. She was trying to create an illusion that bill Maguire was still alive. Investigators also find that five days after bill went missing, Melanie took a trip to Delaware. She says she was furniture shopping. We believe that that was when she took the suitcases with bill's remains and got rid of them in the Chesapeake bay. And the first suitcase turned up the very next day. The circumstantial evidence against Melanie is piling up. But investigators need physical evidence to link her to bill's murder. So they scour the couple's townhouse. They couldn't find any forensic evidence whatsoever to establish this was a crime scene. I don't know how you would dismember a body and effectively clean that up. Still, investigators decide to arrest Melanie on the circumstantial evidence, more than a year after bill's murder. Her 2007 trial becomes a media circus. The evidence in this case points to a well- organized, meticulously-planned, execution of a murder. Were you somebody if you were going to do something you were going to do it all the way? Correct. If that's the case then I would have been sure not to include my own luggage. I don't get to be an evil genius and an idiot at the same time. Prosecutors present evidence they say was key to Melanie's claim, including a forensic examination of the home computer searches. How to purchase guns illegally. How to commit murder, and undetectable poisons was searched. I was a nurse. If I wanted to look for something like that, I have a book that I can look in that doesn't leave an internet history. And then the evidence that was referred to as human sawdust. Microscopic pieces of bill Maguire's flesh investigators had found in his car. That theory was that this nurse, who was kind of so maparticularless accidently tracked these human sawdust particles of bill's body from the house to the car. The prosecution's star witness, Dr. Bradley Miller and the secret recordings he'd made for investigators. After you tape recorded her, sir, you then had additional intimate relations with her, correct? Yes, sir. I think that was damaging to his character. It was a very big turnoff to the jury. We looked very closely at Dr. Miller. There was no evidence connecting him with this crime. How do you find as to the count of the indictment charging Melanie Maguire with the murder of William Maguire? Guilty. Melanie Maguire is now serving a life sentence at a correctional facility in new Jersey. Having exhausted her appeals, she reached out to criminology professor Megan sacks. She had done poorly in the justice system and was frustrated. After visiting with her the first time, I was like, this is a story, this is important. In 2019, sacks and her friend decided to make a podcast. This was the first time someone was basically saying "We hear you." The series looked into the gun that was used to kill bill, which was never found, and the trash bags the prosecutor said matched the trash bags Melanie used to throw out bill's clothes. He ran tests, but he didn't do all the tests that you actually need to definitively say whether these bags matched. They put on a really good show. When you have props, two garbage bags, oh, wow, those do look alike. Based on the testing we conducted and results I observed I felt confident at the time to believe that those bags were created at the same run. And questions about animal hair inside the suitcases. They looked high and low to connect Melanie to some pet, and once they found out that there was no way to connect Melanie to these pet hairs, it became not of evidentiary value. You mentioned that you found some animal hairs. Did you find anything that you considered of evidential value? No. Melanie did not incapacitate, shoot, use a saw to dismember her husband, and also, if the crime scene didn't happen there, and she's home with her children all night, where is this happening? There are just too many holes in this story. This was a murder trial. It wasn't a contest to see who could outsmart the investigators and if someone is smart enough to successfully hide a crime scene that they win. Did you find any evident that exonerates Melanie? I wished we did, I had hoped we would. I still think we might get a tip-in that direction. What do you say to the people at home who watch this and say how dare she talk from prison and bring this all up again? The killer is out there, and it's not me. There are times when and media can shine a light where what the government did was not right. This is not one of those cases. I think bill deserves to be remembered as fantastic friend. A dad who loved his boys. He didn't deserve this.

A young man stabbed two people Friday outside the former Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, where 12 people were killed in 2015, and a terrorism investigation has been opened into the new attack, authorities said.
 The suspected assailant had been arrested a month ago for carrying a screwdriver but was not on police radar for Islamic radicalization, France's interior minister said. He said the screwdriver was considered a weapon, but did not explain why.
 Two people were wounded in Friday's attack, and two suspects were arrested, although the links between the two suspects weren't immediately clear.
 The main suspect, a young man with speckles of blood on his forehead and wearing orange gym shoes, was arrested on the steps of the Bastille Opera in eastern Paris, authorities said.
   
   
 The site is not far from where Friday's attack took place, outside the building where the weekly Charlie Hebdo was located before the 2015 attack.
 The interior minister said the assailant arrived in France three years ago as an unaccompanied minor, apparently from Pakistan, but his identity was still being verified.
 "Manifestly it's an act of Islamist terrorism," Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in an interview with public broadcaster France-2. "Obviously, there is little doubt. It's a new bloody attack against our country, against journalists, against this society."
 France's counterterrorism prosecutor said earlier that authorities suspect a terrorist motive because of the place and timing of the stabbings: in front of the building where Charlie Hebdo was based until the Islamic extremist attack on its cartoonists, and at a time when suspects in the 2015 attack are on trial across town.
 Prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said that the chief suspect in Friday's stabbings was arrested, along with another person.
 Ricard said the assailant did not know the people stabbed, a woman and a man working at a documentary production company who had stepped outside for a smoke break.
 An investigation was opened into "attempted murder in relation with a terrorist enterprise," according to the terrorism prosecutor's office.
 French Prime Minister Jean Castex said the lives of the two wounded workers lives were not in danger. He offered the government's solidarity with their families and colleagues.
 The prime minister noted the "symbolic site" of the attack, "at the very moment where the trial into the atrocious acts against Charlie Hebdo is under way."
 He promised the government's "unfailing attachment to freedom of the press, and its determination to fight terrorism."
 People in the neighbourhood were stunned, saying on French TV that they were reliving the nightmare of the newsroom massacre.
 In a tweet, Charlie Hebdo strongly condemned the stabbings.
 "This tragic episode shows us once again that fanaticism, intolerance, the origins of which will be revealed by the investigation, are still present in French society....There is no question of ceding anything," the newspaper said.
 The two people confirmed injured worked for documentary film company Premieres Lignes, according to founder Paul Moreira. He told France's BFM television that the attacker fled into the subway, and the company's staff members were evacuated.
 Moreira said a man in the street "attacked two people who were in front of the building, didn't enter the building, and who attacked them with an axe and who left." He said the company had not received any threats.
 His colleague, Luc Hermann, describing witnesses' version of the attack, said the assailant first struck the woman in her face, then the man, before returning to attack the woman again.
 "The whole team ... took refuge on the roof of the building like our team did five years ago during the attack of Charlie Hebdo," he said on France-2.
 He said it was "incomprehensible" that authorities had not taken special security precautions particularly at this time.
 A wrenching, two-month trial in the Charlie Hebdo attacks is currently unfolding at the main Paris courthouse. Murmurs broke at the terrorism trial of 14 people, including 3 fugitives, accused of helping the attackers in the January 2015 killings, as the news filtered through.
 The widows of the two brothers who forced their way into the newspaper's offices and opened fire at a morning editorial meeting testified Friday.
 Caty Richard, a lawyer for the Charlie Hebdo journalists, heard about the knife attack in the midst of the trial.
 "My first thought was this will never end," she said. "I am devastated, angry." The interior minister conceded that security was lacking on the street where Charlie Hebdo was once headquartered. He said that 775 police protect its new location.
 But "there was an attack so we could have done better," he said. The minister said he has ordered special protection for all "symbolic sites," noting in particular Jewish sites ahead of the Yom Kippur holiday this weekend. A Jewish grocery store was targeted days after the Charlie Hebdo newsroom massacre in what authorities say were coordinated attacks.

PARIS (AP) — French women enjoy a reputation for their instinctive knack for spot-on chic attire. But now they may well be confused.
 Ministers, already working overtime to tamp down the coronavirus spread and ramp up the economy, have gotten side-tracked in a debate about whether crop tops or other skimpy clothing on adolescent girls in classrooms is a grave affront to the French Republic.
 Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer has said that girls should go to school dressed in “a republican manner.” That apparently means prim and modest, but no one is quite sure.
 Meanwhile, fueling the feeling that women in France just can’t win, some have come under fire recently for covering up too much — by wearing a Muslim headscarf.
 Blanquer was responding to an initiative started on social media, dubbed the Monday, Sept. 14 Movement, encouraging students to come to school in their best “provocative” or “indecent” clothes. The idea was to claim freedom from what is seen as an implicit dress code in public schools, which have no written rules about attire.
 In a land where portraits and statues of the bare-breasted symbol of France, Marianne, are omnipresent, Blanquer's remark drew mockery on social media. Some posts portrayed women of the French Revolution in their traditional “Phrygian” bonnets, and dresses with deep decolletés exposing cleavage.

Sue Jerzak of Honeoye has lived in Honeoye for 18 years and a particular thought has crossed her mind from time to time. It's about an annual pilgrimage, and plenty of people around her are part of it every year, but she's never been part of it.
 This autumn, that will change. Because after plenty of thought and consideration, Jerzak finally pulled the proverbial trigger and is now licensed to hunt whitetail deer.
 "I've wanted to try it for years," said Jerzak, 45, who took the Department of Environmental Conservation's mandatory Hunter Education Course. "I have friends who hunt, but I grew up in Rochester … I've always had an interest, but nobody to do it with."
 Jerzak is not alone. And if the numbers for 2020 are any indication, she and plenty of other new hunters won't be alone in the woods when the regular season (gun) for deer in the Southern Zone opens at sunrise on Nov. 21.
 DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos on Sept. 10 tweeted that the sale of hunting licenses on Day 1 this year was three times the number sold on Day 1 of 2019. This comes on the heels of news earlier this summer that the number of people who registered to take the Hunter Education Course was nearly double the total number that took the course in 2019.
 "There is anecdotal evidence that more people are hunting this year," said Kelly Stang, DEC Wildlife Biologist and Hunter Education Course coordinator. "License sales for a number of resident hunting licenses were up this past spring over the same time period last year. What we don't know yet is if they were new hunters or hunters who just had more time this spring to actually get out turkey hunting."
 More numbers, more concerns
 To be sure, the trend is a bit of a surprise. And while many experienced hunters are pleased to see the possibility of more hunters in the field after years of declining numbers, there are some concerns.
 But at its root, many hunting officials are trying to identify the source of the surge. The DEC is in the works of developing a survey to gain a better understanding of the motivation but it is apparent that the coronavirus pandemic is a big part of it.
 The impact of the pandemic has changed daily life in countless ways, including shortages at grocery stores. Plenty of food items are in demand and even if the supply is there, prices have trended upward.
 That's especially apparent for meat, which saw a tremendous spike in prices during the early part of the pandemic after several supply chains were disrupted. The prices have rebounded a bit since then, but it appears more New Yorkers are not willing to take that chance again.
 So when Glen Adams, a DEC certified hunter safety instructor, of LeRoy first learned of the increase in people registering to take the safety course, he was impressed.
 "It really struck me," he said. "20,000 is the number I heard at first and I thought that was a lot."
 By Aug. 10, the DEC said that number was up to 71,108 who registered to take the course and 37,004 who completed it. In 2019, 20,000 people completed the course. Bow hunters require an extra course and in 2019, approximately 9,000 completed the course. In mid-August, approximately 7,000 had completed the bow course.
 In total, more New Yorkers were certified to hunt big game in the first eight months of 2020 than in all of 2019. Licenses for trapping are up as well and on Aug. 10, the first day New Yorkers could purchase their hunting licenses for the upcoming deer season, the DEC reported license sales of $922,444. Last year, that figure for the first day of sales was $347,103.
 "That's just phenomenal," said Adams. "I can't really explain it other than the ease now of getting the classes going on-line."
 Indeed, because of the pandemic, the DEC in March switched hunter safety courses to a virtual setting. The bowhunter course went virtual in July. In the past, people could take part of the course on-line at home and print the homework portion of the course. Students then brought that homework to the in- person portion of the class -- sometimes called the range day -- that finished the certification process and allows the purchase of a hunting license.
 But with the virtual instruction, the in-person instruction is not happening and that's where firearms safety is not only stressed, but practiced. So missing that element, along with not seeing students physically complete the coursework are a couple of the main concerns for instructors.
 "Who exactly is taking the class?" said Adams. "And we usually have the range day portion where we have students hand off a gun properly when crossing an obstacle. And then we learn to track animals … That's the fun part, where we help more people get through it."
 Adams said the importance of the range day is that it allowed instructors to watch and see who is paying attention.
 "We can see if someone is fooling around and we have the right to fail that student," he said. "But in the time I've been doing this (17 years), it's happened just once."
 By early September, the DEC resumed in-person hunter safety courses but said the virtual courses will remain indefinitely as an option.
 As for Jerzak, she has relied on the help of friends to learn firearm safety, something she admits she was uncomfortable with initially.
 "I've learned a lot," she said, adding that she spread out the six-hour course over a few days. "There are the common sense things and things I didn't know like how to respect other people and their property (as a hunter). A lot of things I wouldn't have thought of on my own."
 The combination of the course and firing a shotgun under the guidance of friends has helped with the comfort zone and she's ready to be in the woods in November. She didn't quite credit the pandemic for providing the final bit of motivation to get her certification but taking the course and getting out to hunt helps fill the abundance of time on her hands.
 "I definitely have more time on my hands," she said. "I literally go to work and then home. So really, I had no reasonable excuse to not do this."
 Run on canning supplies
 As impressive the rise for hunting numbers is, there is more evidence of a shift for people to be more self-reliant. Especially when it comes to food.
 In addition to deer hunting being a big part of the autumn process for many, so too is food preservation. While it's difficult to pinpoint numbers, there is no question more vegetable gardens were planted this season.
 This spring, at the height of the pandemic concerns, vegetable seed sales "surpassed any year in history," said Russell Welser, Senior Resource Director at the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Ontario County. "That obviously tells you that a lot of people are gardening for the first time, gardening to get back into it or extending what they already grow."
 The impact is showing up at stores that sell canning supplies. Jars, lids and rings -- and even apple cider vinegar that's used as a pickling agent -- are difficult to come by and a recent round of phone calls to five different local stores that sell these supplies offered the same explanation: We have nothing.
 What's more, dates and times for future shipments of supplies were unknown.
 Welser said he hasn't had an uptick in people requesting information or help with canning food, but there is plenty of on-line instruction that could account for that. Still, the empty shelves are an indication that more people than usual are preserving food.
 "With COVID, there is a fair number of people out of work and lots of people have time on their hands," he said. "There is no easier way to feed yourself than to grow your own."
 Welser also is among the new hunters in New York. He took the state course because now seemed ideal, he said.
 "For a lot of people, it was the unknown," he said. "We had shortages on food and even toilet paper, so is it going to be like that again? … We're seeing increases all over. More people are going out to hunt, more people are trapping furs for money and any number of outdoor activity. I think most folks are thinking they just want to do something."
 That observation is in line with what Stang of the DEC is seeing.
 "All outdoor recreation is on the rise in the state during the pandemic, and with greater interest in obtaining local food it would make sense that more people are interested in starting hunting or getting back into hunting for the same reasons," she said.
 In many ways, the surge of new hunters and trappers can be seen as a positive. The money generated by license sales goes back to the land in the form of support for conservation projects and protection of natural resources to benefit anyone who enjoys the outdoors. In addition to the record sales on Day 1 of the licenses, the DEC said that the first two weeks of sales have generated more than $6.2 million compared to $3.5 million over the same time period last year.
 Add to this the increased interest and participation in canning food, and Welser believes the return to food gathering basics can be a long-term benefit.
 "It's rather refreshing that folks are … getting back to nature," he said. "That's the positive of the pandemic, if there is a positive."

That is exactly what Orland Park resident Marty Nachel did, time and time again, in 1995. He documented the places and people he met along the way with the intention of immediately publishing a guidebook.
 His book wouldn’t see the light of day for another 25 years, when Nachel in August self-published “Tapped Out: A Look Back at Midwestern Craft Breweries 25 Years Ago” through Amazon. But the journey that led to the paperback release started even longer ago, and its context has been altered by a quarter-century of the beer industry’s growth.

With Zimbabwe's coronavirus infections on the decline, schools are reopening, along with churches, bars, restaurants, airports and tourist attractions. Strict lockdowns designed to curb the disease are being replaced by a return to relatively normal life.The threat has eased so much that many people see no need to be cautious. With his face mask stuffed into his pocket, Omega Chibanda said he's not worried about Covid-19."We used to fear coronavirus, not anymore," the 16-year-old said in the crowded Chitungwiza town on the outskirts of the capital, Harare. "That's why I'm not even wearing a mask."As the global death toll from Covid-19 approaches 1 million, Zimbabwe and several other African countries have not experienced the widespread surges and many deaths that were predicted. That has invited complacency."It's all relaxed now," Chibanda said.Earlier this month, Zimbabwe went a week without recording any deaths from coronavirus, and new infections and deaths have declined, as in South Africa and Kenya.Africa's surge has been leveling off, with its 1.4 million confirmed cases increasing relatively slowly. Antibody testing is expected to show many more infections, but most cases are asymptomatic. Just over 35,000 deaths have been confirmed on the continent of 1.3 billion people.But the improving figures and the start of the searing heat of the Southern Hemisphere's summer could undermine efforts to beat back the virus even further, said community health worker Rosemary Rambire.She leaves home early in the morning and returns in the evening after going door to door calling "the gospel is here" and gathering families for quick awareness sessions."Our job is now harder to do because people are no longer afraid," Rambire said. "Some even tell us that it has not killed anyone they know. Most of them say the sun kills Covid-19 so they have no reason to worry."Some think they are immune once they eat garlic, ginger and onions, she said.In her 14 years on the job and through multiple disease outbreaks, Covid-19 has been the most difficult to get people to take preventive measures, she said."It's different from before, when we did campaigns on cholera (and) HIV. We could tell that people were afraid. They tried to follow preventive measures," she said. "With Covid-19, they are not afraid."Many people look at the infection and death figures in Zimbabwe, compare them with other countries "and conclude that it only affects other countries and not Zimbabwe," Rambire added.In Chitungwiza, a sprawling working-class center on the southern edge of Harare, people no longer wear masks at markets, funerals or other public events. Masks are now the exception in many of Harare's poor residential areas."We have lost both the initial Covid-19 fear factor and the motivation to comply with national guidelines," said Aaron Sundsmo, of the charitable organization Mercy Corps. The group has now enlisted local soccer, music and film celebrities to renew awareness.The government will "not hesitate to do something really strict" to curb any creeping complacency, said Dr. Agnes Mahomva, the chief Covid-19 response coordinator in Zimbabwe."The dire projections that 'Africa, you are going to be toast,' perhaps actually helped us. We tightened up," she said.Continued vigilance should accompany Africa's apparent success story, said Mervyn Joullie, deputy regional director for Africa at Mercy Corps, which operates in 16 of Africa's 54 countries.Limited testing in many African countries makes it difficult to assess "the reality of Covid-19 situation," Joullie said.In West Africa's Sahel region, for example, positive cases of Covid-19 have declined over the past several weeks amid low testing capacity, which could suggest "a significant presence of undetected cases," Joullie said.Health experts point to Africa's youthful population as a factor in why Covid-19 has not taken a larger toll, along with swift lockdowns and the later arrival of the virus.Many African countries have eased the lockdowns and curfews in recent weeks to boost economies battered by the virus outbreak and, in some cases, ease local political pressure.Balancing concerns about unemployment, security and access to food, as well as the complacency and the need to keep infections low could be Africa's next big challenge, experts said."We are at a crossroads as we relax some of the restrictions," said Dr. Mahomva, Zimbabwe's Covid-19 response coordinator. "It's not over until it's over."But for Chibanda, the teenager in Chitungwiza, there is no such dilemma."Coronavirus is not an issue anymore here," he said, pointing to people walking on the street without masks. "Just look around."

Ronald Perelman, who's sold more than $200 million of art from his extensive collection in recent months, is putting more trophies on the block.The billionaire owner of Revlon Inc. is offering a group of works at a Christie's auction on Oct. 6 that could bring more than $180 million, including paintings by Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the pieces are being offered anonymously.Since the end of July, Sotheby's has disposed of more than $200 million of Perelman's art, both privately and at auction. Some proceeds from the sales were slated to pay down loans from Citigroup Inc., according to people with knowledge of the arrangements.Representatives for Perelman and Christie's declined to comment.Perelman's offerings have been a major boon for auction houses in what has been a difficult year for the art market. The global pandemic dramatically reduced the volume of sales, canceled live events and upended the decades-old calendar and formats.Christie's added the October sale -- which will be live- streamed from New York -- ahead of its traditional November auctions. Perelman's consignment was finalized this week and by Friday paintings by Rothko and de Kooning were in Hong Kong for private viewings, according to a person familiar with the deal.Perelman's investment company, MacAndrews & Forbes, said in July it was reworking its holdings in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the ravages it caused to American businesses, including his own. The 77-year-old said in a statement last week that the time had come for him "to clean house, simplify and give others the chance to enjoy some of the beautiful things that I've acquired just as I have for decades."Christie's said it will offer Rothko's 1967 "Untitled," with a $30 million to $50 million estimate. The work last sold at auction for $1.2 million in 1998, according to the Artnet database. Perelman bought it privately in 2002.De Kooning's 1953-1955 "Woman (Green)" may fetch $20 million to $30 million, according to Christie's website.Also on Oct. 6, Sotheby's will offer an abstract canvas by Gerhard Richter, owned by Perelman and estimated at $15 million to $18 million, at its contemporary auction in Hong Kong, testing Asia's demand for high-end Western contemporary art.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

 Construction has begun on a dozen new coach homes in the Viansa neighborhood at Talis Park, Naples’ luxury master-planned community offering championship golf, a unique club experience, and new estate and condominium homes.
 The new coach homes from WCI, a Lennar Company, complement their collection of luxury terrace and penthouse homes offered within the intimate Viansa enclave. Featuring 1,710 and 2,376 square feet of living space, coach homes in Viansa offer three bedrooms, two baths, and private two-car garages. Second-floor homes with elevator access offer a study.
 With an open great room design, Viansa coach homes feature expansive lanais and loggias that enhance the indoor-outdoor connection and offer lush preserve views. Starting in the high $500,000s, the coach homes are scheduled for completion in spring 2021.
 Viansa coach homes feature modern designs and finishes, plus upscale appliances and fixtures without compromise or additional cost, as part of Lennar’s simplified “Everything’s Included” homebuying process.
 Also available in Viansa, terrace homes offer 2,350 square feet of living area with nature preserve views, while penthouse homes feature more than 2,900 air- conditioned square feet with wraparound loggias overlooking Talis Park’s legendary golf course. Both homes feature three bedrooms, a den and three-and- a-half bathrooms, and the convenience of a lock-and-leave lifestyle.
 Viansa is just short walk, bike or golf cart ride away from the Vyne House, the epicenter of activity for Talis Park residents offering formal and casual indoor and alfresco dining. Residents enjoy a resort-style pool with a newly installed bar overlooking the 18th green of Talis Park’s Greg Norman and Pete Dye co-designed golf course, along with a state-of-the-art fitness studios and spa services.
 The enclave is also convenient to Talis Park’s Sports Complex, which boasts six lighted Har-Tru tennis courts, a tennis pro shop, four bocce ball courts, a 50-foot lap pool, a playground and basketball hoops. Next to the driving range, Casa Cortese sports pub offers billiards, shuffleboard, darts and a Trackman golf simulator. Talis Park residents also have The Beach Runner, the community’s exclusive complimentary Mercedes-Benz Sprinter beach shuttle, at their disposal.
 Talis Park has a full offering of move-in ready and to-be-built opportunities for future residents. Homes start from the high $500,000s to $10 million.
