The song, overall, has a quality to it that it’s not finger-pointing. It’s not saying somebody’s to blame; although I may feel that way personally, this song does not include any of that. It’s a song that takes into account the struggles that people are going through in difficult times. And it was Jim’s idea to add to it a final verse that would be more hopeful. So we put together a verse that was not in the original Stephen Foster song. That’s become my favorite part because it’s not only a song of doom and gloom, which is what people are feeling in the moment, but it adds a note of hope. And I think we need that, too.

We have been blessed with bright planets to easily see in the evening sky (Mars, Saturn and Jupiter) and early morning sky (Venus). Let's try for another you can easily see with a pair of binoculars!      The planet Uranus, one of the gas giants, is seventh in line from the sun. British astronomer Sir William Herschel made history after spotting it in his 6.2-inch, 7-foot-long reflecting telescope, on March 3, 1781. This was the first planet ever discovered since mankind first looked up at the heavens enough times to see that some of the bright points of light were slowly moving, unlike the stars.      He made repeated observations over several weeks and consulted with other astronomers before confirmation was made.      The planet has been detected many times before, but astronomers mistook it for a star.      Uranus is well placed in the evening sky this fall. It is actually bright enough to find with eyes alone, as long as you have a dark, clear sky and dark-adapted eyes. It is shining at magnitude +5.7 and appears like one of many very dim stars.      You need a detailed star chart showing where to find Uranus. Once you think you have it, you can confirm it is Uranus by checking back over the next few nights to see if it has moved.      With binoculars, it is easy as pie. 10x35 binoculars will do fine; 10x50 makes the planet even brighter. If you have a telescope with a mirror or lens at least 3 inches wide, use an eyepiece giving you around 100x and you will share what Sir Herschel must have felt, when you see it as a small disc, unlike any star in the night sky.      It appears to have a somewhat greenish tint in a telescope. Some say bluish. I see it as pea green. Anyway, the color is from the perpetually clouded shroud enveloping Uranus, made up of methane gas. What color do you see?      In the early evening, face east to see the constellation Aries the Ram, and Cetus the Whale. Uranus is right between the "tail" stars of the Whale, which is an easily recognized star pattern on the east side of the constellation. (That's the left side as seen from those of us what I like to say are "Up Over" \- opposite of Down Under - and living in the Northern Hemisphere.)      There are four principal stars of Aries. They make a line that bends down on the west (right) side.      To help you find this region in the sky, Aries is a little over to the right from the glittering, compact Pleiades star cluster, a sight you can't miss. This year, over to the right of Aries, is the bright red planet Mars.      Uranus is very unusual among the planets as it is literally tipped on its side. The axis of rotation, through the planet's north and south poles, is tilted 98 degrees with respect to the planet's orbit. The Earth's axis is tilted 23.5 degrees. It is thought that a major collision knocked the planet over, long, long ago.      At 31,518 miles across, four Earths could fit inside. There are at least 27 moons circling, and 13 extremely faint rings.      Uranus takes 84 Earth years to go around the Sun, which is 1.83 billion miles away, on average.      NASA's intrepid Voyager 2 spacecraft flew by Uranus in 1986.      It may be some time before another space vehicle ventures to Uranus, but with a simple pair of binoculars, you can have a look for yourself the next clear night and let your imagination whirl.      It can make a memory. Like others, I have kept a journal of my astronomical observations. I first located Uranus over 50 years ago, on March 6, 1970, with 7x35 binoculars. I showed the planet to my mother. Uranus was in the constellation Virgo at the time, and has completed more than half of its orbit since then.      The moon is at last quarter on Nov. 8, and new moon is Nov. 15.      Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania.

The only current U.S. senator who graduated from a Journal Star-area high school will have to wait a few more months to see if she'll return to office.
   
 Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler will face the Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, in a runoff election Jan. 5 in Georgia.
   
 Loeffler graduated in 1988 from Olympia High School in rural Stanford in McLean County, not far from the farm where she was reared. The Olympia district includes much of southeast Tazewell County, including Armington, Hopedale and Minier.
   
 No candidate among the 21 in the special Senate election this week in Georgia received at least 50% of the vote. In such cases, the top two vote-getters advance to a runoff, according to Georgia law.
   
 Warnock won about one-third of the vote in this election. Loeffler won about 26 percent. She split most of the Republican vote with U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, who won about 20 percent.
   
 Loeffler took office in January. An Atlanta-based financial-firm executive, she was appointed by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to fill a vacancy left by the resignation of ailing GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson.
   
 This is the first time Loeffler has served in public office. She also is part- owner of the Atlanta Dream, a WNBA franchise. The 5-foot-11 Loeffler played varsity basketball, among other sports, at Olympia.
   
 Loeffler's brief Senate career has not been without controversy.
   
 Reports suggested Loeffler traded stocks in her portfolio after being part of a senators-only briefing about the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated Loeffler and cleared her of wrongdoing.
   
 Loeffler's husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is chairman and CEO of the company that owns the New York Stock Exchange. The couple's net worth exceeds $500 million, according to The Washington Post.
   
 WNBA players also have been actively supporting Warnock, a response to Loeffler's lack of support for the Black Lives Matter movement.
   
 The impending Senate runoff might help determine which political party controls the chamber. As a result of this election, Republicans lost at least one seat from their 53-47 majority, with final outcomes of other races pending.
   
 Whoever wins the special-election runoff in Georgia would serve until the completion of Isakson's six-year term, in 2022.
   
 Warnock is senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had preached.
   
 During her years at Olympia, it became apparent Loeffler was destined for success, according to a schoolmate who now is the Oly principal.
   
 "I would say Kelly always had a pretty charismatic personality, but she was very bright and articulate and just kind of a beacon of light in her class," Ed Jodlowski said earlier this year.
   
 "I think this sends a great message to our students that you may not become the next senator, but you can become anything you want if you work hard and do the right things. Kelly obviously did the right things in high school and beyond high school."
   
 Loeffler's 50th birthday is Nov. 27.

Nov 6 (Reuters) - The mental toll that comes with spending long periods in bio-secure bubbles should be taken into account when the length of cricket tours are being decided, India captain Virat Kohli said on Friday.
 Playing within bubbles has become the new normal for teams since the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the game in March.
 Kohli has spent the last two-and-half months in a bubble in the United Arab Emirates, leading Royal Challengers Bangalore's (RCB) bid for their first Indian Premier League (IPL) title.
 Immediately after the conclusion of the IPL, Kohli will enter another bio- bubble in Australia where India play six short-form internationals followed by four tests.
 "These things will have to be considered," Kohli told RCB TV ahead of their eliminator against Sunrisers Hyderabad in Abu Dhabi later on Friday.
 "Like, what length of the tournament or series one is going to play, and what impact it will have on players mentally, to stay in a similar environment for 80 days and not getting to do anything different."
 Kohli said he and his Bangalore team mates enjoyed the time together in the bubble but conceded that repetitiveness was an issue.
 "These things have to be seriously thought about," said Kohli, who celebrated his 32nd birthday on Thursday inside the bubble.
 "At the end of the day, you want the players to be in the best state mentally and physically. Mentally it can be taxing if this continues for this long a period." (Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; editing by Peter Rutherford)

It’s not surprising that the presidential election between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee former Vice President Joe Biden was not decided on Election Day. The votes will continue to be counted, and there is a good chance there will be recounts in areas where counts are very close. It might very well end up in the courts.


  What we do know is that Republicans gained seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate will more than likely remain Republican. While the presidency might be too close to call, we have a few clear takeaways.


  First, Trump has brought about an increased interest in politics and participation. We had the highest turnout since 1900, with almost 70% of those eligible to vote projected to do so. This is fantastic.

Hamlin has had conversations with Harvick and some of his Stewart-Haas Racing crew since Harvick's dramatic elimination. Hamlin appreciates the season his rival has put together in the pandemic-altered season, when there was no practice or qualifying, and Harvick and crew were good every week with the car brought straight from the shop.
 Harvick was so focused on winning a second Cup title that he homeschooled his 8-year-old to minimize health risks. The No. 4 team was locked in on the championship and everyone expected them at Phoenix.
 “In my mind he was deserving of racing for a championship, but didn’t earn it because of the system,” Hamlin said. “I understand their pain."
 There's a balance, though, in commiserating with Harvick and exulting over the opportunity ahead. Keselowski won a series-high six races in 2014 but didn't make it to the final four that season, the year Harvick won his only title.
 Now Keselowski is in the championship round with a chance at his own second crown.
 “It’s a helpless feeling. It’s a frustrating feeling. But it’s what the format is,” Keselowski said. “I do feel those sympathies for him. In a selfish way, I’m glad that I won’t have to compete against him.”
 Logano raced his way into the finale as the only playoff driver with a third- round victory. Since clinching his berth three weeks ago, his Team Penske crew has been focused on a plan for Phoenix and doesn't much care about Harvick's fate.
 “I honestly as a competitor don’t have many feelings for others,” Logano said. “When I’m competing, it’s about my team.”
 Elliott, racing in the final four for the first time in his career, has somewhat shielded himself from the dramatics of the season and focused only on his Hendrick Motorsports effort. He's taken a break from social media over the closing months of the season and didn't focus on Harvick's season.
 “For us to sit here and talk about others, or the other three guys in it, or who’s not in it, who somebody thinks the favorite is or isn’t, is just very unproductive in my eyes,” Elliott said. “I’m just really thinking about us, being selfish in a lot of ways this week, trying to put emphasis on the things that are going to make us go fast. Me ranking Kevin’s season is not one of them.”

“In retrospect,” South says, “it may have been a mistake for Democrats across the board to make this election all about health insurance. About 92% of Americans already have health insurance — about 68% through their employers. Democrats act as if half the American population is uninsured. They’re preaching to a crowd that is already insured. People ask, ‘What does that have to do with me?’”
 In 2018, running on healthcare worked for Democrats. But campaign consultants, like generals, often make the mistake of fighting the last war.
 The Democrats running against Trump’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic did seem to work.
 During the presidential primaries, however, the Democratic candidates’ liberal yacking — although not by Biden — about “Medicare for all” probably scared off voters, especially when Trump bellowed “socialism.”

“We wanted to make this fantastic book series into a TV drama, and we had no idea how to do it. The market was not ready for such a production,” says Hefzy. “(Netflix coming on board) really was the beginning of making the dream come true. It's been a very long journey, but I think worth the wait because we learned a lot. This is a show that we could not have made earlier because just there's no way that we could have done something of that magnitude, in terms of production execution, challenges, and the freedom to risk so much on the idea. No Arab broadcaster or streaming service would have taken such a risk on a property of such size and that budget and with a genre which is untested in Arab drama and Egyptian drama.”

  The more information first responders have when they arrive at the scene of an emergency, the better they are able to assess the situation, leading to a more positive outcome.


  Carrollton Police Department’s Special Neighbor Assistance Program (SNAP) is an effort to identify citizens with special needs and better assist them.


  “Enhancing our citizens’ well-being and confidence by deploying proactive and progressive policing methods will elevate our most vulnerable population’s life in our city,” Sgt. Omereo C. Potts said. “It is of the utmost priority to deliver the most professional, efficient services to the residents of Carrollton.”


  The program utilizes information gathered from a form, which is filled out by residents on a voluntary basis. This information is then given to 911 dispatch and entered into their system and shows up on the computer monitor during a 911 call from that resident.


  Dispatch advises all responding agencies this residence may contain a person with special needs, such as being non-ambulatory, wheelchair-bound or bedridden, hearing or visually impaired. It also provides a secondary contact person for the residence. By having this information available, response time is significantly reduced and there are fewer miscommunications on the scene.


  Some goals of the department’s community policing programs, including SNAP, are to increase police presence and visibility in neighborhoods, do door-to- door knock-and-talks, establish rapport and community feedback, hand out crime-prevention material, provide information on crime affecting that neighborhood and identify citizens that might require special assistance.


  The SNAP program increases residents’ feelings of security, enhances cohesiveness between neighbors and public safety personnel and decreases response and reaction times for all public safety and emergency response personnel.


  All members of the department are encouraged to identify residents who live in the city limits of Carrollton who may qualify for SNAP. Information may also be collected via officer/citizen contact, computers, phone, mail or from contacts made by other officers or city employees.


  “Sgt. Kurt Catudal established the SNAP program while he was here,” said Sgt. Potts. “He put his heart and soul into it. I proudly keep this program going just as he intended.”


  For questions concerning this program or how to submit someone’s special needs information to the Carrollton Police Department, please call (770) 834-4451.

Harvick was so focused on winning a second Cup title that he homeschooled his 8-year-old to minimize health risks. The No. 4 team was locked in on the championship and everyone expected them at Phoenix.


  "In my mind he was deserving of racing for a championship, but didn't earn it because of the system," Hamlin said. "I understand their pain."


  There's a balance, though, in commiserating with Harvick and exulting over the opportunity ahead. Keselowski won a series-high six races in 2014 but didn't make it to the final four that season, the year Harvick won his only title.

“Comerica’s top priority is to ensure the safety of our customers, employees and communities,” a spokesperson for Comerica said in an email. “Our business- continuity team continues to actively monitor events across all our markets to determine if any necessary actions are needed. Conversations remain ongoing ,and we stay prepared for the ever-changing circumstances.”


  As of midday Tuesday, federal banking agencies — the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. — had offered no advice on how to handle branch security this week. Two industry trade groups, the American Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America, declined to comment.


  Citizens is among the companies prepared to take even more action should the need arise.


  “As with many organizations, we are monitoring the external environment closely and taking prudent steps to ensure that impact on both business operations and potential property damage are minimized,” a Citizens spokesman said in an email. “This includes making plans to board up branches in select areas where there is the potential for disruption. We will continue to monitor the situation in the coming days and are prepared to take additional steps as appropriate.”


  Some credit unions, meanwhile, are following suit. In Washington, National Institutes of Health Federal Credit Union boarded up a branch on Pennsylvania Avenue, along with an external interactive teller machine at the facility, said Steve Levin, vice of marketing and business development at the Rockville, Md.-based credit union.


  “We had some vandalism, for lack of a better word, when the George Floyd protests occurred, so out of an abundance of caution our property manager boarded up the entire complex,” Levin said Tuesday. “We don’t know what’s going to happen today, so we decided to close the branch an hour early. We’ll figure out later today or tomorrow what we’re going to do in terms of opening tomorrow, and we’ll be watching the news very closely.”


  Two of the nation’s largest credit unions, Navy FCU and Boeing Employees Credit Union, which does business as BECU, have not closed branches yet but have not ruled it out, either. Representatives for both institutions said management will continue to monitor the situation in the communities those credit unions serve and would adjust operations as needed.


  “We have a communications system in place for alerting both employees and members should we have to close any Neighborhood Financial Centers out of an abundance of caution,” a BECU representative said by email Tuesday afternoon.


  As for how long banks and others stay boarded or closed, it’s anyone’s guess, Friedlander said.


  “It’s going to depend on the immediate aftermath, either overnight or as the week extends into the weekend,” he said. “Then it will be the responsibility of the individual bank to determine its threat level” as election results become clear and banks monitor their own risk.


  “It’s possible that it will be several weeks’ duration,” Friedlander added.

That said, this does not bode well at all. The president of the United States and much of the conservative media apparatus instantly got themselves on board with a preposterous story about a stolen election. If Trump weren't so incompetent, or if the election were closer, it's easy to imagine a much more successful effort — which is basically what happened in 2000, when a conservative Supreme Court installed George W. Bush by judicial fiat. Just because an election theft failed from incompetence doesn't mean a future one won't succeed. _Ryan Cooper_

As with all market entries, the initial investment phase is focused on building our customer base and, as a result, the US market has seen revenue negatively impacted by big bonus campaigns during the second half of the quarter, but still grew 22 per cent sequentially.

A week of rain spoiled crops, washed away bridges and flooded homes across Central America. Hurricane Eta’s arrival Tuesday afternoon in northeast Nicaragua followed days of drenching rain as it crawled toward shore. Its slow, meandering path north through Honduras pushed rivers over their banks and pouring into neighborhoods where families were forced onto rooftops to wait for rescue.Marta Julia Portillo, 62, fled her San Pedro Sula neighborhood before dawn Thursday with relatives. They paused at a gas station on dry ground until they were told to move on.“We don’t know where to go because we don’t have any place to shelter,” she said. Her son, who stayed behind at the family home, told her water was up to the third floor.“I would say the national capacity has been overwhelmed by the size of the impact we are seeing,” said Maite Matheu, Honduras director for the international humanitarian organization CARE. The group was using its network of contacts in Honduras to identify the hardest-hit areas and catalogue their most-pressing needs.Honduras Foreign Affairs minister Lisandro Rosales said via Twitter that “the destruction that Eta leaves us is enormous and public finances are at a critical moment because of COVID-19, we make a call to the international community to accelerate the process of recovery and reconstruction.”Observers are already anticipating that the havoc wrought by Eta will pressure more people to migrate from countries that are already some of the primary senders of migrants to the United States border in recent years.“Now with this situation, this is going to be an exodus, a massive exodus of migrants toward the north,” said Matheu.Late Thursday, Tropical Depression Eta had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and was moving north at 8 mph (13 kph). The forecast had it strengthening to a tropical storm before nearing the Cayman Islands Saturday and crossing Cuba Sunday. From there it could reach Florida or at least come close enough to assure heavy rains.“Whatever comes out (of Central America) is going to linger awhile,” said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. “I’m not convinced we’re done with Eta.”That’s because what’s left of Eta still has spin, which is hard to kill off, and that should help it reform, said NOAA hurricane and climate scientist Jim Kossin.Once it reforms and heads toward Cuba, it could meander in the area for awhile.“The winds aren’t going to be the problem. The rains are going to be the problem,” Klotzbach said.Eta will be so big, wet and messy that it doesn’t have to make landfall in already rain-soaked South Florida to cause a mess, Klotzbach said.“Slow-moving sprawling ugly tropical storms can certainly pack a precipitation wallop even if it doesn’t make landfall,” Klotzbach said.___Pérez D. reported from Guatemala City.

"They all used her bookshop as a sanctuary," Whitman said.


  During World War II, as the shop's story goes, Beach closed Shakespeare and Company in 1941 after refusing to sell her last copy of Joyce's "Finnegans Wake" to a German Nazi officer. The bookstore re-opened in a different guise in 1951, with a new address and owner -- George Whitman. The rest is history.


  Since last week's email appeal, it's not only Whitman's daughter who has been overwhelmed. Shakespeare and Company's website, run by a small team, has been overloaded with book orders and donations.


  Sylvia Whitman looked to the past for a solution to her new problem.


  Inspired by how the bookshop weathered the worldwide financial fallout from the Wall Street crash of 1929, she has set up a Friends of Shakespeare and Company fund with a website link that supporters can click to send donations.


  "It is inspired by Sylvia Beach during the Great Depression, who had a difficult time, obviously. A lot of expats had to leave Paris, as it was too expensive, so she and her friends set up a Friends of Shakespeare and Company," Whitman said.


  While the bookshop is a Paris institution, Whitman still maintains her eccentric and down-to-earth spirit that she seems to have inherited from her late father, George.


  At several points in an interview with the AP, Shakespeare and Company's resident dog, appropriately named Colette, interrupted with barking. Whitman said it was because Colette had a strong opinion on certain matters.


  Shakespeare and Company's financial troubles didn't begin with the coronavirus pandemic. Paris in recent years has been a theater of calamities that caused lasting problems for small shops and businesses that rely on out- of-town visitors -- from terrorist attacks and anti-government protests to the devastating April 2019 fire that closed Notre Dame Cathedral.


  Like many independent stores, competition from online retailer Amazon has also cooled commerce, although Shakespeare and Company has been shielded more than most booksellers by its fame.

On Tuesday morning in Washington's Farragut Square, a normally bustling commercial district about two blocks north of the White House, parking was severely restricted and nearly all retail establishments were boarded up. Some of the bank branches in that area were still open for walk-in business but several, including the boarded-up JPMorgan and M&T branches, were closed for the day and perhaps longer.


  A Bank of America branch across the street from boarded-up United Bank and Amalgamated branches on K Street was operating normally, with no plywood on its windows, as were nearby PNC Bank and Citibank branches.


  M&T, based in Buffalo, N.Y., not only boarded up some branches in the Washington area, but it also had to temporarily close three of them as building landlords decided to secure their properties, a bank spokesman said. The bank encouraged customers to visit the M&T website to check the hours and status of other branches.

In California, the national hesitation to side with Democrats was reflected in the outcome of five ballot propositions.
 Two measures placed on the ballot by the Democrat-dominated Legislature were rejected. One was Proposition 16, which would have repealed the ban on affirmative action in public education, contracting or employment based on race, ethnicity or gender. The second, Proposition 18, would have allowed many 17-year-olds to vote.
 Voters passed Proposition 22, which repealed the major part of a bill the Legislature passed to require many companies to reclassify independent contractors as employees. The measure will allow ride-hail and delivery drivers to keep working independently, a major defeat for labor.
 In rejecting Proposition 25, voters scuttled legislation that eliminated the requirement of cash bail for release from jail before trial.

“By and large, the issues facing FCS are not FCS issues. People say things like, ‘I’m disappointed in Flint Schools,’ when what they mean to say is, ‘I’m disappointed in Flint Schools’ funding, I’m disappointed in the legislative destruction of public education, I’m disappointed in society’s ability to allow education to be based on zip code.’ The problems they are going to face will not be solved with rushed decisions and a hammerhead approach.” Lester said.
