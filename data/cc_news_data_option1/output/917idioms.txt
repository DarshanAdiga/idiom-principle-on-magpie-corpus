Thirteen European countries and tens of companies on Friday pledged to use less plastic and recycle more, a move NGOs said was positive but no substitute for government regulations on plastic pollution.The Netherlands, France and Denmark spearheaded the European Plastics Pact, which was signed by two of Belgiums three regions and a host of firms, including German chemicals firm Henkel and Finnish oil refiner Neste. Participants commit to make their plastic packaging reusable where possible and in any case recyclable by 2025, while increasing plastics collection, sorting and recycling capacity by 25 percentage points.They aim to produce at least 20 less virgin plastic meaning newly made plastics that dont contain recycled materials by 2025. Companies will aim to use at least 30 recycled plastics in their products and packaging by 2025. If we want to tackle climate change, we need to look beyond energy to materials. We have to start treating plastic as the valuable raw material it is and keep it out of our oceans, Dutch environment minister Stientje van Veldhoven said.NGOs welcomed the pledge but said it did not let governments off the hook. It remains completely voluntary and can never be considered as a replacement for ambitious regulatory measures on single-use plastics and packaging, said Delphine Levi Alvares from Zero Waste Europe.The EU will ban single-use plastic straws, cutlery and plates by 2021, in a bid to stop them littering the environment. Next week the bloc will unveil a circular economy plan to cut waste in sectors like plastics and construction. Researchers estimate the world has produced more than 8.3 billion tonnes of virgin plastics. Only 9 of this has been recycled, with 79 ending up in landfills or the natural environment, and the rest incinerated. Editing by John Chalmers and Chizu Nomiyama

The Minister of Police, General Bheki Cele, has commended the Hawks and the Special Task Force rapid response team that arrested five cash heist suspects, who also allegedly shot and killed two officers in Mahikeng, North West.Cele on Friday expressed condolences to the families and colleagues of the two deceased members.The apprehension of the five suspects, with three, fatally shot and two injured, can only bring cold comfort to those who lived and worked with the slain members. We are, however, hoping that it will bring some kind of closure to the bereaved families, the Minister said in the statement. Cele has urged the tracing and investigating teams to leave no stone unturned in their effort to find the remaining suspects.On Thursday, the Hawks were dealt a major blow when two of its members were shot dead in a confrontation with an armed group of cash-in-transit robbers in Mahikeng, North West.During the gun-battle, three of the gang members were shot dead and four others arrested. The hunt for the remaining suspects has been intensified and the National Commissioner has ordered all police tracing teams to leave no stone unturned to bring these murderous perpetrators to justice, Hawks spokesperson, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, said.It is reported that on Thursday, Special Task Force members engaged suspects around Mahikeng, who were in three vehicles. The Hawks said the armed gang had shot and forced a cash security van off the road.The suspects were confronted as they blew open the van. The suspects retaliated and took off in different directions. In their attempt to escape, two of the vehicles faced off with members from Technical Operations Management Section TOMS of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation DPCI, Mulaudzi said.During the shootout, Detective Warrant Officer Delene Grobelaar 44 was fatally shot. The suspects managed to flee and a manhunt ensued in earnest. Later in the day, one suspect was tracked and arrested at a Johannesburg hospital. Immediately thereafter, a follow-up operation was launched in Coligny, where the wanted suspects were confronted at a filling station by TOMS members. The suspects retaliated with AK 47 rifles, fatally wounding Detective Sergeant Wynand Herbst 42, he said.Three suspects were fatally wounded and two seriously injured during the gun battle. Later in the evening, a further two suspects were traced to Ventersdorp. However, they managed to escape.Mulaudzi said police have so far seized three AK 47 rifles, two 9mm pistols, a bakkie and a minibus connected to the crime.The National Hawks Head, Lieutenant General Godfrey Lebeya, has expressed sincere condolences to the families, friends, and colleagues the deceased members.We shall hunt the members of that organised criminal group that attacked the cash-in-transit vehicle and caused the death of our members.We have recently assembled a bigger team under an experienced Brigadier to deal with these matters. Those who have information should provide the same to the investigators or the police in general, said Lebeya.Meanwhile, the National Commissioner has applauded the team for the successful implementation of the 72-hour Activation Plan.I am satisfied with the speedy response by our members to the brazen robbery and subsequent killing of our colleagues yesterday. The search for more suspects is continuing and I have urged our policemen and women to relentlessly continue searching for the remaining suspects, whilst maintaining their own safety, said General Khehla Sitole.

Just one win away from the International Cricket Council (ICC) Women’s T20 World Cup 2020 glory, Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur could be about to throw the biggest birthday bash of her life. But regardless of whether or not she lifts the trophy on her 31st birthday, the 30-year-old is well aware that the occasion will be one to savour forever. Kaur is on the brink of making history. When she leads India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Sunday, she will become the first woman to ever captain India in a T20 World Cup Final. It’s not just her country’s first appearance in the showpiece, but also one that could break history in setting a world record attendance for a women’s sporting event. But it’s not just about the history books, either. Sunday will be a special day for the skipper in more ways than one with her parents travelling from Moga to see her in action - her mother due to watch her play cricket for the first time. If she was to mark the celebration with a win with them on International Women’s Day, it would be the most fitting of moments for a player who has revolutionised women’s cricket in her country, the ICC press release reported. Kaur featured in the inaugural Women’s T20 World Cup in 2009, but it took a while, and plenty of patience fine-tuning her game as a go-to batter and off-spinner, for Kaur to establish herself as a name in the side. In the wake of a disappointing home World Cup, where India won just one game in the group stages, Kaur was handed the captaincy reigns in 2016 - and that’s where it all changed. Kaur’s innings of an unbeaten 171 to flatten Australia in the 2017 World Cup semi-final sparked a new triumph for women’s cricket in India. When it comes to career milestones, Kaur’s got them aplenty. In 2016, she became the first Indian woman to sign an overseas T20 contract when she signed for inaugural Women’s Big Bash League champions Sydney Thunder. In her debut season, her aggressiveness saw her win plenty of games while finishing as the Thunder’s lead run-scorer, also offering an all-round show with the ball. And later that year, she led India to their sixth straight Asia Cup crown. In 113 T20I innings, she has shone on all fronts, scoring 2,182 runs and taking 29 wickets since her debut against England in 2009. She may have been outshone on the batting front by the likes of Shafali Verma in the run-up to this year’s final, but there’s no doubting Kaur is capable of stepping up in the middle. With her 183 total runs at the 2018 T20 World Cup, the captain has scored the second-highest number of runs for India at the tournament, 32 behind Mithali Raj’s 208 in 2014. Kaur has only hit double-digits once in India’s four wins Down Under and while she knows she cannot beat Raj’s record in one last outing at the MCG, she will know exactly how important it is to step up in the showpiece. Hosts Australia are used to big stage success, with 12 of this year’s squad having lifted the trophy in 2018 - and they will want the show to be theirs in front of a huge crowd at the MCG on Sunday, especially after losing to India in their opening game on home soil. But if there’s one player with a track record of downing their hopes, it’s Kaur. On Sunday, India will no doubt be looking to release their not-so-secret weapon once again.

Women in the Arab region have long struggled to obtain the rights due them under international law and treaties, and for greater representation in their countries' political and social systems. There has been progress in several states but many view the changes as merely scratching the surface and designed to polish the image of governments and ruling political parties.
 In the past few years, several Arab countries have adopted laws to protect women and their rights, particularly in the political arena.
 In Lebanon, some see the presence of six female cabinet members in the new government unveiled on January 22, including Zeina Akar as defense minister and deputy prime minister, as an effort to win over angry protesters who remained in the streets for days after the announcement. This record feminist representation sets a precedent not only for Lebanon but for the entire Arab world.
 Nada Nassef, a Lebanese political activist, has taken part in the protests that began in mid-October against planned new taxes and then widened to what many call a revolution, to express deep dissatisfaction with economic mismanagement, corruption and sectarianism. She told The Media Line that the appointment of six female ministers was "folkloric," as the women were appointed to the "wrong posts" rather than within their areas of expertise.
 "It was a step designed to save face," Nassef said.
 She said there is a misconception that Lebanese women have equal rights but that in comparison with advanced countries, where there is high female representation, "Lebanon lacks that. Also, we still have unfair laws against women, such as the citizenship law and personal status laws that are great injustices for us."
 However, she added that the current revolution highlighted the issue of women's rights, and that being in the streets together day after day demanding government change had created solidarity among females. "But in terms of legislation and laws, we have not achieved anything yet," Nassef said.
 In 2019, the Palestinian Authority, in an effort to protect girls, passed a law setting the minimum age for marriage at 18 for both genders. Moreover, the Women's Affairs Ministry said that by the end of 2019, the PA would enact a Family Protection Law in the Palestinian territories. This after thousands of females protested in the West Bank and elsewhere against physical, psychological, sexual and economic violence against Palestinian women, as part of the Tala'at movement and under the slogan "There is no free homeland without free women."
 Tala'at demonstrations took place in Ramallah and Rafah in the Palestinian territories; in Jerusalem; in Jaffa, Nazareth, Jish and Araba, in Israel; and as far afield as Beirut and Berlin.
 Luban Alashqar, an instructor of social studies at Birzeit University, near Ramallah, told The Media Line that the law setting a minimum age for marriage did not represent real change, as it allows judges to waive the rule in "exceptional cases," "and most of our judges are traditional and conservative," depriving the legislation of real teeth.
 As for the Family Protection Law, she said that it wasn't enacted, despite the PA government's vow to do so.
 Alashqar said that based on the latest survey on domestic violence by the Palestinian Center Bureau of Statistics, there has been a slight improvement, "but the study measured traditional violence, whereas now women suffer now from different kinds of violence, such as violence against them in media and digital content."
 She added that women's respect and freedoms should be reflected in laws and regulations, "as states are judged on the space they give to women's institutions to carry out their work."
 In late 2019, as the issue erupted on social media, the Palestinian street split over a commitment the PA had made in 2014 by signing the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).
 Some Palestinians rejected the treaty, "because it contradicts local norms, religions and divine law," while others supported it, as it aims to eliminate discrimination against women and achieve equality between the sexes.
 Alashqar opined that the division over CEDAW reflected the lack of awareness of the majority and the fact that they formed their opinions based on rumors.
 "It's an international treaty that concerns all the nations around the world. The subject was highlighted in Palestinian social media for deceptive ends, showing certain parts of the treaty but not others. The reactions showed the patriarchal system that dominates the country."
 She said that the treaty confirmed basic human rights, while some clauses that are incompatible with the country's culture could be covered by exceptions.
 In Saudi Arabia, women's rights have noticeably improved over the past two years.
 A central aspect of Saudi Vision 2030, a plan to reduce the kingdom's dependence on oil, diversify its economy, and develop public service sectors, is for Saudi women to work across a broad spectrum of industries, as opposed to being limited to such sectors as education. Saudi women can now obtain travel documents, including passports, without the consent of a male relative. Saudi women now have the same legal rights as men in matters of work, leisure, finance, law and health. Women can now drive and register as co-heads of household, along with their husbands.
 Additionally, Riyadh has committed to raising the female labor participation rate from 22 percent to 30 percent, by reforming both the economy and the legal system.
 Lama al-Sulaiman, a Saudi businesswoman who is vice president of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce, told The Media Line that the Saudi woman had become a partner in the country's opportunities, building, development and public opinion. "She became part of the community and it's only the beginning," Sulaiman said.
 She said that the country's laws and regulations now help women to become partners and contributors in developing the country. "In terms of implementation, there is a certain change required in the culture to ensure that what has been enacted becomes reality," Sulaiman said.
 In Iraq, amid widespread demands to transform the political system, feminists are demanding 50% representation in any new cabinet. Recently, hundreds of women and girls took to the streets asserting their right to participate in anti-government protests and demand political reforms.
 Activists say that Iraqi women have proved themselves through wide participation in the latest demonstrations, which showed that the country's feminist movement, which began gaining steam close to two decades ago, has paid off.
 Milad Latof, a Dubai-based Iraqi journalist and political activist, participated in the protests that began on October 1, demanding an overthrow of the political system and of foreign influence. She told The Media Line that after several devastating wars in Iraq, women became powerless and spent most of the time locked up at home because of sexual harassment and the dangerous security situation.
 "However, the revolution changed that, where the female voice was raised alongside all of the other Iraqi voices that emerged for the homeland," Latof continued. "Iraqi women played a big role in the latest demonstrations, actually an extremely important role. They brought peace to the protests because after the female representation became noticeable, the Iraqi security forces stopped using tear gas and sound bombs [stun grenades], as well as bullets, against the protesters."
 She added that at protests away from "sit-in squares," which didn't include women, weapons were used against male demonstrators.
 Women in Tunisia have witnessed remarkable progress. In 2017, the government passed a law to end violence against women, in addition to the Personal status law. Donia Bin Othman, a Tunisian lawyer and political activist, told The Media Line that Tunisia had always been a leader in terms of women's rights, especially since the Personal Status Law was issued, as it made remarkable progress at all levels.
 "In 2017, a very important law was issued, which has to do with ending all kinds of violence against women, and it was implemented in 2018," Bin Othman said. "The state is required to take all necessary measures to protect women under this law, from physical, moral, economic, social and political violence."
 She added that Tunisian women suffered from male tyranny prior to the Tunisian revolution but that women's rights were among many issues considered within the context of political, social and economic reforms afterward. "However, Tunisian women still demand a law to equalize the inheritance rights of women and men," she said.
 The 2011 revolution in Tunisia, which resulted in the establishment of Tunisia's first democratically elected government, came in response to high levels of unemployment, political corruption and overall poor living conditions. In 2019, Tunis banned the wearing of the niqab - the full-face veil - in public institutions and government offices. The decision came after suicide attacks in the Tunisian capital, as the terrorists wore niqabs to sneak weapons past security forces. Some people, however, feel that the security consideration conflicts with personal freedoms for women guaranteed by a 2011 Tunisian law.

Britains top listed companies must disclose how climate change affects their business, using globally agreed guidance, or explain to investors why they have not, the Financial Conduct Authority FCA proposed on Friday.Investors increasingly favour companies with business models likely to prove robust as climate change raises the risk of storm and flood damage and reduces the value of carbon-intensive fossil fuel assets. The changes we propose will help to provide the transparency the market needs to be able to assess how well companies are adjusting to the risks of climate change, FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said in a statement.Improved disclosures will support better asset pricing and enable investors to make more informed choices about where to allocate their capital, which will ultimately support the transition to a low carbon economy, Bailey said. The FCA proposes that all commercial companies with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange make climate-related disclosures that conform to an approach set out in 2017 by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD.The risk-assessment framework was established by the Financial Stability Board, which coordinates financial rules for the Group of 20 Economies G20. Sovereign-controlled companies would also have to comply, the FCA said, implying Saudi Arabias state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, would also have to meet the requirements should it seek a London listing.There are 480 premium-listed companies on the London Stock Exchange with a combined capitalisation of 2.3 trillion pounds 3 trillion, or 60 of total market capitalisation. The proposal is that they must make disclosures or explain why they cannot.The watchdog also said in a consultation paper it would consider extending the proposed rule to a wider range of listed companies. For some of them a binding rule may not be achievable for now as they have further steps to take to make disclosures of the highest standards.The watchdog proposed on Friday that it would also provide guidance on existing obligations that require issuers to disclose information on climate-related, social and governance ESG matters. This would be for all companies with listed securities, not just those on the premium segment.The FCA said it was also considering how best to enhance climate-related disclosures by the firms it regulates, including asset managers and life insurers, to ensure a coordinated approach. A public consultation on the proposal ends in June, with final rules published later in 2020. 1 0.7693 pounds

 Loren Jerome Sand Loren Jerome Sand passed away peacefully on February 26, 2020 with his family by his side. Loren was born January 20, 1947 to Walter and Hazel Sand in Everett, WA, the eldest of three boys. He attended Everett schools and graduated from Cascade High School in 1965. After high school he attended Everett Community College until the winter of 1965 when he and three friends enlisted in the Army together on the buddy system. He was stationed in Georgia for basic training and spent time in Korea. He enjoyed serving his country earning a sharpshooter badge and a National Defense Service Medal, but the draw of a cute checker at the House of Values, back home was too much. Loren and Karen married on March 9, 1968 at Fort Campbell, KY, making their first home in Clarksville, TN. Loren was honorably discharged from the Army in September of 1968, to pursue school. After returning to Everett, Loren worked with his father in construction while attending Everett Community College. Eventually he changed his mind about the construction industry and started working at the City of Lynnwood in the planning department. In 1970 their son, Jon was born. In 1972 Loren enrolled at the University of Washington School of Engineering. With Karen's support, he managed school, work and a young family. He graduated Tau Beta Pi with a Civil Engineering degree in 1976, the same year that Jon graduated kindergarten. After graduation he worked for the design firm of Gray and Osborne Inc. for several years before returning to the City of Lynnwood for a 23 year career including serving as the City Engineer, Public Works Director, and Executive Assistant to the Mayor. Loren transitioned to Snohomish County and retired as the County Engineer. His love of working, and wanting to continue to make a difference, he came out of retirement to work for Perteet Inc. in Everett where he has remained on their Board of Directors. Loren had a passion for public service and has served on many county and state committees, such as the City of Everett Planning Commission, SCCIT (Snohomish County Committee for Improved Transportation), Seattle Viaduct Committee, and many others. Loren thoroughly enjoyed his second retirement as a devoted follower of his grandsons baseball adventures. He spent countless hours bundled up, sitting on baseball bleachers up and down the west coast and across the country watching their baseball games thru their collegiate careers. Always in the stands, rain or shine. Family has always been Loren's focus and creating memories was at the top of his list. To celebrate Loren and Karen's 50th wedding anniversary, Loren planned an amazing European trip creating lifetime memories for his family. Other great adventures include Spring Training trips, and following Husky football (30 year season ticket holder), including going to the 2019 Rosebowl. Loren's love for family included all branches of the genealogy tree as well as long time treasured friends. His passion for making connections with multiple generations of cousins led to great family reunions and interesting trips for he and Karen across the country and to Norway. Loren loved bicycle riding and rode weekly with local buddies who call themselves the Big Shots. Their support and encouragement for the last 10 plus years helped to inspire Loren every day. Their friendship brought so much joy, fun and happiness to him thru their rides and fellowship. Loren's life was based on building things and relationships. Building homes with his father growing up; a better community with his years of public service; a wonderful marriage and life with Karen and their family; a strong bond with his parents and brothers; an amazing fatherly relationship with his daughter-in-law; and an unconditional loving and supportive bond with his son and grandsons. He was also an excellent carpenter who enjoyed woodworking, remodeling homes and building a cabin at Lake Riley where he loved to spend time enjoying the outdoors and the Lake Riley community. Although not the cause of his passing, Loren fought Prostate Cancer for the last 12 years and it was a daily physical demand for him, but the love of his family and great friendships pushed him to embrace each day and treatment with a smile. Loren was preceded in death by his parents, Walter and Hazel Sand. He is survived by his wife Karen of 52 years, their son, Jon and daughter-in-law, Erin; grandsons, Connor and Parker; brother, Duane and nephew, Daniel, brother, David and wife, Jean, nephew, Chris and wife, Laura, and niece, Katie and husband, Peter and their children, Peter, Caroline and Mary. Due to the current community health concerns, a Celebration of life will be scheduled at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.
