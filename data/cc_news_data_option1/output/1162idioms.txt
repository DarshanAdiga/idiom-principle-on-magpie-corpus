As bad as this outbreak is‚Äîand it‚Äôs very, very bad‚Äîeveryday life, for the moment, isn‚Äôt as challenging for most Houstonians as it was during Harvey. We haven‚Äôt lost electricity or water, and there‚Äôs no reason to think we will. People are self-isolating in their own homes, surrounded by their creature comforts. Even if we have to shelter in place, as San Francisco is doing, the vast majority of us are going to be okay.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tensions are rising in Washington between those who argue the country needs to get back up and running to prevent an irrecoverable depression, and medical experts who warn that, unless more extreme action is taken, the human cost will be catastrophic. President Donald Trump is caught in the middle of that debate. Health experts have made clear that unless Americans continue to dramatically limit social interaction -- staying home from work, isolating themselves -- the number of infections will overwhelm the health care system. But pushback is growing as the economic impact snaps into focus.

REPURPOSED: General Motors is exploring the production of ventilators at a facility in Kokomo, Indiana. The automaker said Monday that it's working around the clock with Ventec Life Systems of Washington State to build more of the critical medical devices. GM spokesman Dan Flores said he can't comment on how many more ventilators Ventec will make or how soon they will come. The GM statement also didn't say when the Kokomo facility might be in operation. Supply chain experts say it will be difficult to repurpose an auto plant to build a smaller, unrelated product such as ventilators. They say such a change could take months, but GM may be doing it faster. In an email to GM senior management late Sunday, Shilpan Amin, the company's vice president of purchasing, wrote that GM has commitments from Ventec's parts companies to supply 93% of the ventilator's parts to GM. The company is developing plans for the remaining 28 parts, he said in the email.

In addition, the Secretary of State has also today announced that reviews and reassessments for disability benefits are being suspended for the next three months. The suspension will be kept under regular review and extended if necessary.
 These stronger measures come in response to the changing situation and mean more staff are being deployed to process new claims and make payments, with remote support a top priority for the department.
 Around 10,000 existing staff will be moved to process new claims, with 1000 already in place. In addition, the Department is expecting to recruiting 1500 extra people to aid the effort.
 The changes are part of the Government‚Äôs effort to stop the spread of the virus, supporting people to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. The measures follow Government guidance last week that people were not expected to attend face to face jobcentre appointments, and the suspension of face-to-face assessments for all sickness and disability benefits for the next 3 months.
 In the meantime, all services can be accessed online and over phone with the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey is urging people to use online services first, helping keep phone lines free for those who really need them.

From Caracas to Tehran, officials are calling on the Donald Trump administration to ease crippling economic sanctions they contend are contributing to the growing death toll caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The idea has gained support from prominent leftists in the US, including Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who say throwing a financial lifeline to some of the United States' fiercest critics is worth it if lives can be saved.
 "It's absolutely unconscionable to keep sanctions on at this moment,‚Äù Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Centre for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, said in an interview. "The only moral, sane and legal thing to do is stop the madness that is crippling other countries' health systems." But almost in the same breath, the same officials in Iran have rejected U.S. offers of aid ‚Äî a sign to critics that scapegoating and pride, not US policies, are causing immense harm.
 American companies have been blocked from doing business with Iran and Venezuela for almost two years, after the Trump administration unilaterally pulled out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers and launched a campaign seeking to oust Venezuela's socialist president, Nicol√°s Maduro, for allegedly committing fraud in his 2018 re-election. The escalating restrictions have drastically reduced oil revenue in both countries and led to tensions that, in the case of Iran, culminated in a January drone strike that killed a top Iranian general.
 US officials have brushed aside the criticism, saying that the sanctions allow the delivery of food and medicine. But most experts say shipments don't materialize as Western companies are leery of doing business with either of the two governments. "In most cases, compliance by banks makes it virtually impossible to do business," said Jason Poblete, a sanctions lawyer in Washington who has represented American citizens held in Cuba, Venezuela and Iran.
 Iran has reported more than 1,810 coronavirus deaths as of Monday, the fourth- highest national total in the world, and its government argues US sanctions have exacerbated the outbreak. It has been supported by China and Russia in calling for sanctions to be lifted. The European Union's top foreign policy chief on Monday called on the US to make clear its sanctions don't target humanitarian aid. "Even amid this pandemic, the US government has vengefully refused to lift its unlawful and collective punishment, making it virtually impossible for us to even buy medicine," Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a video statement.
 He also published on Twitter a list of the supplies that Iran urgently needs, including 172 million masks and 1,000 ventilators. "Viruses don't discriminate. Nor should humankind," he wrote.
 US officials say providing sanctions relief to Iran would only fund corruption and terrorist activities, not reach people in need. They point out that Venezuela's medical system has been in a free fall for years and shortages predate the sanctions. Far from pulling back, the Trump administration has been expanding its "maximum pressure" campaign on Iran, finding time in the middle of the virus frenzy to blacklist five companies based in China, Hong Kong and South Africa that it says are facilitating trade with Iran's petrochemical industry.
 "This is a sort of tired regime talking point, saying that the sanctions are impacting their ability to deliver assistance for their people," said Brian Hook, the State Department's representative for Iran. "If the regime is sincere about looking for resources to help the Iranian people, they could start by giving back some of the tens of billions of dollars they have stolen from the Iranian people." Kenneth Roth, the head of New York-based Human Rights Watch, which has issued scathing reports on abuses in Iran and Venezuela, said the international community should come together to help every country, even those under sanctions, gain access to needed medical supplies.
 "The US government should clearly state that no one will be penalized for financing or supplying humanitarian aid in this time of a public-health crisis," he told The Associated Press. The virus' spread in Iran was exacerbated by days of denial from the government about its severity amid the 41st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and attempts to boost turnout for February parliamentary elections. Hard-liners in its Shiite theocracy, meanwhile, have stormed shrines closed due to the virus as the public largely ignores guidance from health officials to stay home.
 In Venezuela, the impact has been less severe ‚Äî only 77 confirmed cases and no deaths. But its healthcare system was already in shambles like the rest of the economy, with as many 70 per cent of hospitals reporting electricity and water shortages, so even a small disease outbreak can trigger major havoc. Together the two countries control around 30 per cent of the world's petroleum reserves, so they are expected to be among the hardest hit from a halving of crude prices this month that reflects forecasts for a global recession.

Though Leal sacrificed shot attempts being part of a talented team, he still wound up averaging 18.5 points as a senior at Bloomington South while working on aspects of the game that don‚Äôt show up in the box score. Often, Leal took on the challenge of guarding the opponent‚Äôs best player.
 ‚ÄúI could have gone into each game thinking, 'OK, I‚Äôm going to go for 25 shots and try to just get my stats up really nice,'‚Äù Leal said. ‚ÄúBut what the team needed me to do is just be a leader and be a guy that can get other people going and also do some of the dirty work and still be able to score points and rebound and all that kind of stuff. So I was just really focused on making sure I could do what my team needed, and I think I did that as well as I could throughout the season.‚Äù
 Leal was recognized last week as Indiana‚Äôs MaxPreps player of the year and is in the running for Indiana Mr. Basketball, which will be handed out in May.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a blessing and an honor to be recognized like that for all of my hard work, and I think that it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs really special, and hopefully they‚Äôll be more to come,‚Äù Leal said. ‚ÄúBut, at the same time, I really wish we could have finished the state run with my team.‚Äù
 Leal is keeping in touch with his fellow IU 2020 classmates -- guard Trey Galloway and swingman Jordan Geronimo -- as often as he can. He‚Äôs also been on the phone with 2021 five-star point guard Khristian Lander of Evansville Reitz. A former AAU teammate of both Leal and Galloway, Lander is considering reclassifying to 2020 and joining the Hoosiers next season. Leal and Lander could have squared off in a Class 4A regional championship game in Seymour had the tournament not been canceled.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to be a really good fit for IU, whether he‚Äôs coming this year or next year,‚Äù Leal said. ‚ÄúBut I think he‚Äôs really athletic, quick. He gets other people open. He can get to the rim. He can finish. He can shoot. He‚Äôs just a really all-around good point guard, and I think that he‚Äôs going to be able to help a lot.‚Äù
 With IU coming off a 20-12 season that was cut short due to the pandemic, Leal is excited about the future of the program and contributing next season as the Hoosiers enter Year 4 under head coach Archie Miller.
 ‚ÄúCoach Miller and his staff are doing really great, and they are sticking to their vision for what they think is best for the program, and I really believe in that,‚Äù Leal said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve shown their belief in me, and I think that they can continue to recruit the guys that want to be at Indiana and want to be Hoosiers. I think they are going to see a lot more success and that we‚Äôre going to be able to hopefully do something special.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat I'm really upset about is he's a physician, and he ought to know best in the whole Senate,‚Äù Emanuel told MSNBC.Paul defended his actions in a statement Monday. Since most senators travel frequently by plane and attend "lots of large gatherings, I believed my risk factor for exposure to the virus to be similar to that of my colleagues, especially since multiple congressional staffers on the Hill had already tested positive weeks ago,'' he said.‚ÄúFor those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine, realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee, I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol,'' Paul added. Current federal guidelines would not have called for him to get tested or quarantined, Paul said."It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested,'' he said.Paul, 57, had surgery last year to remove part of a lung damaged in a 2017 assault by a neighbor who attacked him over a long-standing landscaping dispute. Paul broke several ribs in the incident and was later awarded $580,000 in damages and medical expenses.Paul said his decision to get tested was not related to his attendance at a Mar. 7 fundraiser for a Louisville art museum. Two event attendees have tested positive for COVID-19, but Paul said he "never interacted with the two individuals even from a distance.''‚ÄúPerhaps it is too much to ask that we simply have compassion for our fellow Americans who are sick or fearful of becoming so.'' he said in the statement released by his office. "Thousands of people want testing. Many ... are sick with flu symptoms and are being denied testing. This makes no sense.''Paul went into quarantine Sunday after learning his results.His announcement led Utah‚Äôs two GOP senators ‚Äî Mike Lee and Mitt Romney ‚Äî to place themselves into quarantine, stepping away from negotiations as the Senate worked on a $1.4 trillion economic rescue package for the coronavirus crisis. At least five senators, including Paul, are in self-quarantine.Paul was on Capitol Hill this past week, including at a luncheon Friday among GOP senators. He spoke on the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon, addressing the cornonavirus and a failed amendment he sponsored that would have paid for virus relief efforts by withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan.A spokesman for Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said Moran briefly saw Paul at the Senate gym Sunday morning and shared that information with GOP colleagues. Moran ‚Äúfollowed CDC guidelines and kept a safe distance between him and Sen. Paul,‚Ä≥ spokesman Tom Brandt said. Moran has spoken with the attending physician at the Capitol and has been told he does not need to self- quarantine, Brandt said.In a tweet Sunday, Sinema said Paul acted irresponsibly: "You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results. It endangers others &amp; likely increases the spread of the virus.‚Ä≥Other senators, including Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, had gone into self-quarantine while they awaited the results of a coronavirus test. Both were negative.A day after Paul‚Äôs announcement, calls grew among senators for remote voting. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted that ‚ÄúI totally support‚Äù the idea and said the change should be made before the Senate leaves town. First-term Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., tweeted that ‚Äúextraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. It is time to bring the Senate into the 21st century.‚ÄùSens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Dick Durbin of Illinois have put forward a bipartisan resolution to amend Senate rules to allow senators to vote remotely during a national crisis."At some point (remote voting) is going to become inevitable,‚Äù said Sen.

DHEC said some of that $45 million will allow the agency to hire more people, buy more protective equipment, pay for staff support, finance an education campaign, cover the costs of quarantine and transportation and any other unexpected expenses related to fighting the coronavirus.Gov. McMaster is also asking for South Carolina hospitals to immediately restrict visitations to patients, with the exception of end of life situations. The governor asks for compassion from South Carolina residents, and he also wants people to stay home to keep from spreading the virus.McMaster has called for all public colleges and universities in the state to determine which employees are needed to ensure classes can continue online for the rest of the semester.Around the same time as the news conference, officials at the University of South Carolina announced that all campuses within their system will be closed through the end of the semester due to the coronavirus pandemic. Also, UofSC has postponed all commencement ceremonies in May for all campuses. Officials are looking into possibly rescheduling in-person ceremonies.Winthrop University is also moving to remote instruction for all courses for the remainder of the semester and is postponing spring commencement ceremonies.As the state‚Äôs number of positive cases expectedly increases, DHEC will continue to provide the number of positive cases and the county of residence. DHEC‚Äôs COVID-19 county map provides the number of cases by county and is updated daily.‚ÄúOur top priorities remain preventing the spread of the disease and protecting the public health,‚Äù Traxler said. ‚ÄúThis includes working to control spread and sharing measures that best protect our neighbors, friends and family.‚ÄùGov. McMaster has also issued an executive order stating new guidelines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The executive order will close all dine-in services at restaurants and bars beginning on Wednesday, March 18. To-go/take out services will be allowed.McMaster also announced that he is prohibiting organized events of 50 or more across the state. The Department of Revenue has extended the state tax deadlines to June 1. McMaster also asked grocery stores and big box stores to limit the number of customer purchases on paper products and disinfectants.FACTS ABOUT CORONAVIRUS The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the coronavirus is spread mainly from person-to-person by those in close contact, or through coughing and sneezing by someone who‚Äôs infected.Symptoms of coronavirus can show up between two and 14 days of exposure, health officials said. Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But some severe cases can lead to death.Those who are at the highest risk of catching COVID-19 are the young, the elderly and those who are already being treated for chronic medical diseases.Young people who contract the virus are not likely to have a serious case, research shows.Doctors said there is not currently a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, but over-the-counter medications, like cold and cough medicines, can help treat symptoms of the virus.The mortality rate for people with the virus has been widely reported around 2 to 3%, but health experts note the actual percentage is not that high, as not all cases are diagnosed or reported.The rate is higher than the flu, which kills on average about 0.1% of people who get it, based on a 10-year average of data from the CDC.Anyone with concerns about their health, or who believes they are showing symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath, should call their health care provider.People with general questions about coronavirus should call the DHEC Care Line at 855-472-3432. The line is open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day. Callers are urged to be patient as call volumes are high.People without a doctor can take advantage of free online screening from Prisma Health and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC).MUSC has an online platform to aid with coronavirus diagnosis and care. Go to musc.care and access the COVID-19 platform. The service is free with code: COVID19.Prisma Health also has a free virtual visit, which allows patients to video conference with a doctor instead of coming into a facility.

If the regime is sincere about looking for resources to help the Iranian people, they could start by giving back some of the tens of billions of dollars they have stolen from the Iranian people. Kenneth Roth, the head of New York-based Human Rights Watch, which has issued scathing reports on abuses in Iran and Venezuela, said the international community should come together to help every country, even those under sanctions, gain access to needed medical supplies.The US government should clearly state that no one will be penalized for financing or supplying humanitarian aid in this time of a public-health crisis, he told The Associated Press. The virus spread in Iran was exacerbated by days of denial from the government about its severity amid the 41st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution and attempts to boost turnout for February parliamentary elections. Hard-liners in its Shiite theocracy, meanwhile, have stormed shrines closed due to the virus as the public largely ignores guidance from health officials to stay home.In Venezuela, the impact has been less severe only 77 confirmed cases and no deaths. But its healthcare system was already in shambles like the rest of the economy, with as many 70 per cent of hospitals reporting electricity and water shortages, so even a small disease outbreak can trigger major havoc. Together the two countries control around 30 per cent of the worlds petroleum reserves, so they are expected to be among the hardest hit from a halving of crude prices this month that reflects forecasts for a global recession.

Through Messner's words, we learn she was born in the Columbia Valley to a true ranching family. She had two older siblings, and the three of them "enjoyed a childhood of unconditional love and support, punctuated with the occasional, much-needed kick in the butt for motivation."

I am still training with my coach as if the next race on my calendar is Dirty Kanza because I don‚Äôt know what else to do, and it‚Äôs good for me. If they pull the plug on it, then I am putting together bike packing solo rides of my own. In the vein of the Alaska trip, but here in Idaho.
