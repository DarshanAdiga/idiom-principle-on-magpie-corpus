COLUMBIA COUNTY, Fla. (Gray News) - It’s usually the police dog’s job to sink its teeth into an unruly suspect.But deputies in Columbia County said 38-year-old Donald Watts beat their K-9 to the bite.An arrest report reviewed by WJAX shows Watts faces charges for simple battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest with violence and aggravated battery on a service dog.It started on Dec. 27 when a woman called deputies to report Watts for using meth. When deputies arrived, they received another call from a neighbor reporting a man in his yard with a flashlight.Investigators saw the light and approached the suspect. As they moved closer, they could hear strange noises coming from a shallow creek.The arrest report said Watts laughed and made bird noises as he paced back and forth. Other than the mud smeared over his body, deputies said Watts was completely nude.Before they could get him in custody, deputies said he ran away and hid under the stairs of a nearby mobile home. When he came out of hiding, a deputy tried to detain him. But that ended in fisticuffs.Authorities said Watts punched the deputy. Another deputy had seen enough and deployed a Taser.It didn’t work.The deputy who had been punched pulled out his Taser, took aim at Watts and fired.Still, nothing.As the suspect ran away, authorities decided to wait for backup. Six more deputies and their K-9, Casper, joined them.The crew managed to catch up to the suspect in the woods where he reportedly got down on his hands and knees to growl like a dog. Accordingly, they sent their dog to subdue him.But deputies said Watts pounced on the dog and bit its ear. Watts allegedly wrestled Casper to the ground with a chokehold.Even so, he couldn’t hold him forever. Once free, deputies said Casper bit Watts on the head, finally giving deputies the chance to take control.But despite being in custody, deputies said Watts remained defiant. As they led him out of the woods, Watts spat on one of the deputies, the arrest report stated.A local hospital treated the man’s dog bite before authorities locked him inside the county jail.Copyright 2019 Gray Media Group, Inc.

Last year, the event raised more than $6,000 for the charity. This year, organizers were looking to match that total — or better.
 "We definitely want to help the local food banks, especially during this time of year and around the holidays," said O'Brien.
 It's an event that certainly draws a crowd. The wharf was lined with spectators and participants, while members of the fire department were on hand to provide assistance.
 Substitute teacher Christine Thompson was the seventh jumper to take the plunge and it was also her first time participating in the event — part of her New Year's resolution to be bold and try new things.

Editor's note: The Daily News looked at the top stories of 2019, and the YMCA and Dix Crisis Intervention Center opening after years of planning, fundraising and organizing were significant for the Onslow County community. They received honorable mentions on this year's list.
   
 The New River YMCA and the Dix Crisis Intervention Center have been embraced by the community since their openings in 2019.
   
 "The power of the Y has really brought in stories that no one else could have scripted prior to opening," YMCA Executive Director Jane Schirmer said. "We are here to serve and that's why we have been around for 175 years."
   
 Onslow's YMCA, located at 159 Chaney Ave. in Jacksonville, opened in October.
   
 The 8,000 square foot building includes a community room with full kitchen, child-watch room filled with toys, and a large exercise room for group classes like yoga and Zumba.
   
 The Dix Crisis Intervention Center at 215 Memorial Drive opened in February, and like the YMCA the crisis center has been well-received by the community, according to site director Grace Dolfi.
   
 "The community has really come together, but it hasn't just been Onslow or the city of Jacksonville, but also surrounding communities who have supported this," Dolfi said. "This shows that people are looking to make a change and make a positive impact.
   
 "We have been excited about the feedback we have received from the community and we are excited to keep being able to serve."
   
 Dolfi said the crisis center has helped "close to 500 people" and added many of those individuals were self-refers to referred to by friends and family.
   
 Going forward, the center looks to receive an Involuntary Commitment (IVC) designation.
   
 "Right now we are just voluntary, but when we receive the designation next year, if you are unsafe, you can be here involuntary," Dolfi said. "We will continue to offer our services as we have been, but we have submitted an application to for the IVC designation and we hope that comes soon."
   
 Only four miles down the road, the YMCA has also served the area.
   
 Schirmer said January the YMCA kicks off with several events.
   
 "January is always self-motivated month, February is healthy heart focus month and come march, we will have a March Madness fitness challenge," she said. "And on Jan. 23, we will have the American Red Cross blood drive.
   
 "But the great thing is that we do things outside healthy and wellness. We have services for parents and children. In November we had a date night where parents, members and non-members, could drop their children off for a small fee and go shopping or do what they needed to do. It was so awesome."

Surprising in all of this is that Prescott wants to break the bank so badly, it may be at the expense of better weapons around him in Dallas. While he has Elliott, the offensive line did not play well in 2019 and needs re-shaping. At some point, a massive contract figure to the quarterback will mean Dallas can't buy better pieces there.

DES MOINES, Iowa (WHO/CNN) - An Iowa mother wants to warn others about a face mask sold at stores like Target and Ulta after she says it burned her stepdaughter’s face.Chelsea Anders says her stepdaughter only had the Vitamin C Glow-boosting Unicorn Paper Mask on for about two minutes. The girl said it felt like it was burning, and Anders told her to take it off right away.“Her face was welted with red, swollen, itchy, raised abrasions. I had first thought chemical reaction. It’s what a lot of people had assumed when using this product was that it was just an allergic reaction. Then, doing the research after I had seen what had happened, it looks like a chemical burn,” Anders said.Chelsea Anders says her stepdaughter only had the face mask on for about two minutes before she had a reaction to it.The mask is made by the company Yes To, and it is sold at several stores, including Target and Ulta.One hundred reviews from other customers on the Ulta website say they also had reactions to the mask, and there is even a YouTube video review showing the reaction in real-time.Anders says the way the face mask is marketed is concerning because it suggests users be at least 18 years old but features unicorns. She ultimately wants the product to be recalled.The Vitamin C Glow-boosting Unicorn Paper Mask is made by the company Yes To and sold at several stores, including Target and Ulta.“The reviews about children, the same reaction is happening in adults, so suggested ages really isn’t a point to say I understand the difference in the skin care. But your target marketing is definitely children, and if you are suggesting 18 and older, why are you targeting unicorns at 18 and older?” she said.Iowa Dermatology Clinic Nurse Practitioner Christina Warren examined the ingredients in the product.“There was lactic acid in it, fragrance in it, vitamin C, which is a powerful antioxidant that we usually recommend for aging skin or sun-damaged skin. It’s probably not appropriate for younger children,” she said.Warren says a good rule of thumb is to stay away from paper masks that cover the entire face and use a product with which you can easily do a spot test.“Just test a corner of your skin, like maybe on the jawline, and give it some time, even a few days. Because if you have a delayed reaction, you want to make sure that your whole entire face isn’t going to react,” she said.Copyright 2020 WHO-DT, Ulta.com, Anders Family via CNN.

Solskjaer suggested his players may have been affected by fatigue after playing five games in 13 days prior to the trip to Arsenal.
 "We started off decent but didn't capitalise on the two or three counter- attacks we had," said Solskjaer.
 "We were too slow to things and too slow on the ball. That's credit to them because I thought Arsenal played really well. On and off the ball I thought they were excellent. We had some tired heads, maybe.
 "We kept going, we pushed them back, created half-decent chances but the quality in our finishing wasn't good enough."

A steady presence and voice on the Alamance-Burlington Board of Education will serve out his last year in 2020, proud of the progress the district has made and concerned about the future of public schools.
   
 "If you're not improving then you're going backwards," Steve Van Pelt said.
   
 The district and the state still have a serious and growing shortage of teachers as fewer young people go into schools of education, Van Pelt said, as teachers have to do a lot more than teach as the troubles in their students' lives make their way into the classroom. Schools need more counselors, psychologists and nurses to handle those issues, Van Pelt said, so teachers can focus on teaching.
   
 "It's not going to be an easy solution," Van Pelt said. "It's not just teacher pay; it's teacher morale."
   
 Van Pelt, 73, will have served 16 years on the school board when he leaves his last meeting at the end of 2020, but it will be the end of a much longer career in public education.
   
 "I think that I always wanted to be a teacher," Van Pelt said.
   
 There was a strong music program at his school in Cabarrus County, Van Pelt said, and his ambition was to teach music. For the better part of 20 years, he did teach band and chorus in Moore and Rowan county schools before taking a job as assistant principal at Cummings High School in 1988, and later principal of the Sellars Gunn Education Center until he retired in 2002.
   
 "It's different," Van Pelt said. "You have contact with all the kids, not just the ones in your class. You get to see the problems and talents that many of the kids have."
   
 Retirement was never idle. The new Clover Garden Charter School brought him on to start its music program practically before he got out the door, Van Pelt said, and when a couple of school board members didn't run for re-election in 2004, Van Pelt ran for, and won, an open seat. His wife May Ann said it was the chance to put his decades of experience teaching in and running public schools to use.
   
 Van Pelt said he is proud of what the board did over all those years, especially things like starting the Career and Technical Education Center, where high school students from all over the county take vocational and technical classes.
   
 "There was a lot of nay-saying about the building, saying the place was never going to fly," Van Pelt said. "You'll never fill it up -- they filled it the first year, and the next year had a waiting list."
   
 But the past few years have been the most productive, he said, starting with the Vision Plan for Public Education, which was created through a series of large community meetings in 2013 that, by this year, led to the county Capital Plan to update buildings in the Alamance-Burlington School System, Alamance Community College, the local court system and county government.
   
 "That led to the Strategic Plan, which led in turn to the bond issue," Van Pelt said. "It really addresses the needs of our buildings here in Alamance County."
   
 The public input for the Vision Plan also led to great growth in public participation.
   
 "It's been absolutely amazing the community support Alamance-Burlington Schools has had and continues to have," Van Pelt said. "We're building our school system and our community to improve our job situation and make other improvements, too."
