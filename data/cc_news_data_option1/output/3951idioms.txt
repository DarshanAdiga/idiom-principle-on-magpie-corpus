Trump's standing with white, working-class voters has proven resilient through federal investigations, impeachment and countless episodes of chaotic governing. But if those issues were too distant — centred on complicated foreign entanglements — reports about his tax avoidance might have had the potential to hit closer to home during a time of economic upheaval.
 Yet, interviews with voters in swing-voting Wisconsin show scant evidence of damaging impact from The New York Times' reporting this week on Trump's long- secret tax returns.
 In the hub of swing-voting Winnebago County and Milwaukee's dynamic suburbs, the reactions fit into categories of flat-out disbelief, like Fairbanks, defence of a tax strategy as smart business and an overall fatigue many voters feel with every revelation.
 If there is was one common reaction, it's laughter, though not joyful.
 Seth Willer snickered from the front porch of his home in the upscale neighbourhood of Bellhaven Estates near the shores of Lake Winnebago on Oshkosh's east side when asked what he thought about Trump's income taxes.
 “Nah, that's the game, right?" said the 40-year-old industrial laundry equipment distributor who supports Trump. “We all try to lower our tax burden. You can't blame him."
 Likewise, Cathy Gerring, a 60-year-old part-time employee from the north Milwaukee suburb of Shorewood echoed, “I just feel he’s a smart business owner.”
 Mary Herrick, down the street from Willer in Oshkosh's upscale subdivision notes Trump's donation of the president's salary as a counter to criticism of his tax burden. “That’s giving back to the country," said Herrick, who works from home.
 In fact, Trump donates his salary to charities, and continues to earn income from his real estate interests. In 2018, he reported making more than $434 million in a federal disclosure. That same year he reported losses to the IRS of $47 million, according to the New York Times report.
 Some national polls have shown esteem for Trump's performance in business ebbing somewhat after similar stories that have suggested tax avoidance in the past. However, national polls have shown the president's support to be relatively stable at roughly 42 to 45 per cent of voters nationally throughout the tumultuous summer and into the fall.

For long a controversial project, the Yelahanka power plant’s highly delayed commissioning was jinxed in its first attempt with the fire accident. Though the Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. (KPCL) is treating this as a one-off incident, residents and environmentalists who have been fighting against the plant are even more riled up.
 Simmi Kumar, resident of Heritage apartments, which is close to the power plant, said their worst fears had been confirmed. “There was a blast around 3 a.m. Residents saw fire tenders. We didn't know what happened. In the morning we got a message saying there was a blast. This has always been a major fear,” she said.
 She pointed out that they live across the road from the plant. “Gas leakage and a blast can be fatal as they can cover a good distance. This is not a small scare. There is a bird conservation reserve. The loud noise is going to impact their habitat. We have some rare birds in the reserve,” she said.
 In 2013, the closure of the power plant was announced as it was a diesel generating unit at the time. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) had issued a show-cause notice to the then 20-year-old plant, alleging violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The board’s officials had alleged that the plant was fuelled by cheap, polluting Low Sulphur Heavy Stock (LSHS), and not diesel. Around 40 MW power was being generated at the plant.
 Later, work on a combined cycle power plant – the only power plant in the city – was launched by the then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in June 2016. The plant was supposed to be ready by May 2018, but faced delays.
 Abdul Azeem Kalebudde, the advocate for the Yelahanka Puttenahalli Lake and Bird Conservation Trust and Heritage Estate Apartment Owners’ Association, has alleged that KPCL obtained the Environmental Clearance (EC) from the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) by “suppressing the fact that the lakes are declared as Bird Conservation Reserve”, and hence, the Environment Clearance granted by the SEIAA is “void and illegal”.
 “Moreover, no information is provided as to the construction and functioning of the power plant. People in the vicinity have been experiencing vibrations continuously. There is frequent discharge of froth from the plant. Residents are exposed to some unbearable emission of gas, which is let out during the day and unknowingly at night as well. This has already created a fear psychosis among the people staying in the vicinity,” the advocate alleged. He claimed that no steps have been taken despite the matter being brought to the notice of the KSPCB and BBMP.
 This July, the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered serving a notice to KPCL based on an application filed by the Trust seeking nullification and cancellation of the EC granted by the SEIAA.
 V. Ponnuraj, Managing Director, KPCL said the plant will be commissioned in due course. “Generally, we keep two to three commissioning dates, and this was our first attempt. Before we commission the plant, we will wait to learn the root cause of the accident and set it right,” he said.

New Delhi [India], October 2 (ANI): Entry and exit gate for Janpath has been closed and trains will not be halting at this station, said the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Friday.   This comes amid the ongoing protests in the national capital by various parties and organisation, demanding justice for the alleged Hathras gang-rape victim.   "Entry and exit gate for Janpath is closed. Trains will not be halting at this station. Exit gates for Rajiv Chowk and Patel Chowk are closed," the DMRC tweeted.   Meanwhile, Delhi Traffic Police issued an alert saying, traffic on Panchukian road coming from R/A Shamshan Ghat will not be allowed to take a right turn towards Mandir Marg due to the gathering of some protesters.   "Due to the gathering of some protesters, traffic on Panchukian road coming from R/A Shamshan Ghat will not be allowed to take a right turn towards Mandir Marg. The vehicles can take a right turn at R K Ashram crossing," Traffic Police tweeted.  
 Similarly, vehicles coming on Panchukian Road from Connaught Place Outer Circle and intending to take a left turn towards Mandir Marg will also not be allowed. They should also take the left turn from R K Ashram crossing, the Traffic Police added.   Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Youth Congress members, Left parties, members of Bhim Army and student organisations, CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury and CPI leader D Raja are protesting at Jantar Mantar.   Earlier in the day, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attended the prayer meet for the Hathras victim at Maharishi Valmiki Temple in the national capital.   The 19-year-old Hathras girl died at Delhi's Safdarjung hospital on September 29, a fortnight after allegedly being gang-raped. All the four accused in the incident have been arrested.   The government has formed a three-member SIT to probe the case and said the matter will be heard in the fast track court.   The post-mortem report reads that the victim suffered a fracture of "C6 cervical vertebra" and there was "extravasations of blood along the fracture line" and the underlying spinal cord was "contused with ascending oedema". Also, the postmortem report denies rape charges. (ANI)

But doing so is going to require continued public support and compliance, Patrick Parfrey, a clinical epidemiologist at Memorial University, said in a recent interview.
 The bubble enjoys widespread support. An online Narrative Research survey in August indicated more than three-quarters of respondents were opposed to lifting the Atlantic bubble’s 14-day isolation requirement.
 But there is also opposition — particularly to the travel restrictions. In August, Newfoundland and Labrador health officials successfully defended the province's travel ban in court. Parfrey was a witness and spoke to the province's health risks.
 “We haven’t really had a community-acquired case since ... approximately the start of May," Parfrey said. "That’s five months, nearly."
 The region's victory against the virus has been hard won.
 Tourism has taken a massive hit, even with quarantine-free travel permitted within the bubble. Last week, the Atlantic Canada Airports Association said air travel in the region was down 92 per cent from April to the end of August compared with the same period last year.
 And there could still be a long way to go, Susan Kirkland, head of the department of community health and epidemiology at Dalhousie University, said in a recent interview.
 “There was a time in late July where it looked very, very likely we were going to break the bubble and we didn’t,” she said. “Immediately after that, we realized ... it’s too late, we've missed the prime tourist season, and school is on top of us.”
 The amount of public compliance with travel restrictions and isolation orders has impressed Kirkland — but she wonders if there’s a limit, especially with the pandemic's toll on mental health and the costs that come from being alone.
 Atlantic Canada didn’t just go through a pandemic this year. It also went through the worst mass shooting in Canadian history, when 22 people were murdered by a gunman in April, and the police shootings of two Indigenous people during a global uprising against police violence.
 Back in St. John’s, Leek said she spent her isolation reading books and watching television. Her family left birthday cupcakes outside her door and they talked across the veranda.
 “It’s really quite something that we’re all going through,” she said. “But look at where we are. We’re safe here.”

Says McDonald, the Trump campaign spokesperson: “County board members need guidance on how to proceed in the wake of these unelected Democrats’ attempt to radically rewrite the law 40 days out from Election Day."
 On Thursday, the state Board of Elections, which has a Democratic majority, told counties to halt using the new cure method pending the outcome of court hearings this week and next.
 Regardless of the outcome of the litigation, voting rights specialists were stunned at the Trump campaign's step.
 "What we’re talking about is an effort to deliberately place these barriers in front of people. And many may be discouraged from trying to cure, or making it impossible for them to cure, a deficiency,” said Irving Joyner, a law professor at North Carolina Central University who’s not involved in the case.
 North Carolina is not the only state that has seen upheavals to its election procedures even as ballots are being filled out. Many of the more than 200 lawsuits filed over voting issues are still lingering, an enormous question mark over the election as more and more states start early voting.
 Republicans have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a ruling in South Carolina on how to handle errors in mail ballots and a judgment in Pennsylvania allowing the count of some ballots arriving after Election Day. Also in Pennsylvania, the Trump campaign is asking a federal judge to throw out a state law that requires poll watchers to live in the county where they are monitoring. It's become a major obstacle to Republican plans to send out some 50,000 poll watchers in battlegrounds.
 But the GOP's scrutiny of local elections offices isn't always over complex legal issues. In Wisconsin, Republicans warned the city of Madison against holding a “Democracy in the Park” event, sending a cease and desist letter late last week warning it could be a venue for illegal collection of ballots in the liberal bastion. The event went ahead anyway, and city officials say about 10,000 participated.
 On Wednesday, there was a new warning to Milwaukee and its sports teams. It covered not only players but mascots such as the Brewers' famed racing sausages as enticements for people to vote.
 “It seems kind of silly to be worried about racing sausages, but the larger point is the law is pretty clear,” GOP state party chair Andrew Hitt told The Associated Press by phone on Wednesday.
 Wisconsin state elections officials have already warned the Trump campaign off once after it sent a survey to local elections offices asking for details on procedures. Such surveys can help find issues to be litigated — but they also are a way for campaigns to make connections with local election officials who will help determine their success. The Trump campaign noted that such surveys are standard and also sent by Democrats.
 Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine who has been a frequent critic of Trump's approach to voting, said there's a difference between campaigns talking to election offices and trying to pressure them.
 “To know the rules of the game you're going to play under, it's different than trying to work the refs,” Hasen said. “All of this conduct is so beyond the pale — it's hard to put in context because there's been nothing like it in modern American campaigns.”

A rebuttal to the letter published Sept. 28 by Rosalyn LaPier:

Shannon Lee isn’t giving up on finding a new home for “Warrior,” which will eventually be available on HBO Max. It’s helped reveal another side of her father, she said.
 “I think he’s really getting his due as a creative — someone who knows how to story-tell,” Shannon Lee said. “We’re finally getting to see he wasn’t just a flash in the pan.”
 Any fan of Lee — who died in 1973 at age 32 after an allergic reaction to pain medication — will recognize his DNA in the brutal, blood-spilling fights.
 Dustin Nguyen, a star on the original “21 Jump Street” series in the ’80s, plays a menacing tong leader and directed an episode this season. A huge fan who studied under Lee’s old training partner, Nguyen helped sprinkle in nods to his idol.
 “It’s just little things that the writers put in there to pay homage to Bruce Lee without being a caricature, which I think is the danger zone whenever you get to the subject of Bruce Lee,” Nguyen said. “There’s lots of bad caricatures and portrayals of who he is and what people think he is.”
 One of those, in Shannon Lee’s view, was her father’s “cameo” in last year’s “Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood” movie. She was incensed watching a boastful Bruce challenge Brad Pitt’s stuntman to a fight. It was especially “irresponsible” as Tarantino never consulted her but spoke with families of other real-life characters.
 “He was not a bully and he was not arrogant,” she said. “Quite frankly, my father was treated in that film like he was by white Hollywood when he was alive.”
 It was sheer coincidence that the documentary, “Be Water,” aired on ESPN in June. Almost like a tonic to Tarantino’s film, director Bao Nguyen fleshed out the difficult path Lee had to stardom through archival footage and interviews, including with Shannon Lee. The title comes from Lee’s belief that fighters need to be “formless” and adapt like water.
 If Lee were alive, his daughter believes he would be part of the current national conversation about Hollywood white privilege and support Black Lives Matter.
 “He believed in celebrating people’s cultures and backgrounds and not holding it against them,” Shannon Lee said. “He was interested in people showing up as themselves and being authentic.”
