Atlanta started the game quickly on offense, with Matt Ryan hitting Calvin Ridley for a 63-yard completion on the team's very first offensive play. That catch moved the Falcons to the 1-yard line, and they capitalized on the deep shot just two plays later when tight end Hayden Hurst had a 1-yard touchdown reception. The Falcons finished the game with 371 yards on offense, including a season-high 144 rushing yards.

Michelle Loielo filed documents in the Supreme Court of Victoria two weeks ago to have the curfew removed, saying the direction was “invalid, irrational and illogical”. Her lawyer Vanessa Plain told the court Victorians were suffering arbitrary detention by being ordered inside each night, and that the curfew was in breach of Victoria’s human rights charter. But Premier Daniel Andrews announced on Sunday the curfew would be scrapped from 5am Monday — five hours before the trial challenging it was scheduled to begin. Ms Loielo, a 41-year-old mother, owner of Unica Cucina E Caffe on the Mornington Peninsula and Liberal Party member, claimed it as a win. “It’s definitely a win and with Sunday’s announcement I just hope that those suffering with mental health issues were given a bit of hope and can have a little bit of breathing space,” she told NCA NewsWire. “The trial will still go ahead this morning, my legal team is very prepared and I’m very proud to be involved with them.” CONFUSION AS TRIAL BEGINS In the trial on Monday morning her legal team told the Supreme Court of Victoria they were considering how to proceed. “Yesterday we had some unexpected announcements made publicly,” barrister Marcus Clarke QC said. “We haven’t sorted out in our own minds what impact that has on the proceeding. “We’ll need some time to reflect on what the repercussions – the ramifications are – of this order.” Lawyer for the government Kirsten Walker QC said the legal team was waiting for Ms Loielo’s decision. “In light of the revocation the plaintiff needs to say how she proposes to put her case,” she said. “She (is) invited to articulate whether she intends to continue, if she does on what grounds, and if she is seeking relief.” Ms Loielo had sought an order quashing the curfew — which would now be redundant. She was also seeking a declaration from the court that the curfew was illegal — which could still go ahead, with the option for judge Timothy Ginnane to make that declaration retrospectively. ‘I’VE RECEIVED DEATH THREATS’ Outside court, Ms Loielo said her bid to mount a legal challenge had been met with internet trolls, saying she needed two bodyguards at her side for two whole days last week. “The support from people who know me and understand why I’ve done this has been amazing,” she said. “But there has been a lot of trolling from people who don’t know me and it concerns me that people find themselves so freely abusing people they don’t know. “I had to have two bodyguards for two days last week after receiving death threats – I think that just screams that something else is going on in society right now.” ‘WE DIDN’T DROP CURFEW BECAUSE OF LAWSUIT’ On Sunday Victoria chief health officer professor Brett Sutton said a curfew was no longer required following low cases and transmission of COVID-19. “A not-insignificant proportion of our daily cases are in aged care, and a curfew doesn’t address that transmission risk — obviously,” he told reporters. “The individual community cases that we’re seeing are now very small in number. “It was my view, and the public health team’s view, that the curfew was not a proportionate measure to have in place going forward.” When asked by reporters, the Premier denied he had dropped the curfew because of Ms Loielo’s lawsuit. Ms Loielo said she was restricted in commenting about the case while it was ongoing, but assured there was a valid reason behind her legal push. “A much bigger reason has driven my heart through this and once legal proceedings are over that will become more apparent,” she said. “I don’t know Daniel Andrews – he might be the most amazing man, I don’t know – I just know that this curfew is directly affecting myself and those around me, especially those suffering from mental health issues. “Being a primary caregiver to three children and running a business trying to do the basics to get through the day has certainly been challenging over the last six months.” The trial continues.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters on Monday morning she was heartened to see the results overnight, but wanted to see a drastic increase in testing. “I am worried about the lower rate of testing,” she said, noting only about 6,400 people were tested on Sunday. “Can I please encourage everybody not to get complacent. Make sure when you are out and about that everybody is socially distanced … if you’re with the family in school holidays, if you’re at a venue or outdoors, please note the threat of virus is still around us. “The only reason we’ve done well is because everyone has been careful, has been following the health warnings. I don’t want to lull us into a false sense of security. We have to keep the virus at bay.” Monday’s numbers come after the state began to wind back restrictions, with dancing now allowed for up to 20 people at a wedding and more than one parent able to watch their children play weekend sport. Ms Berejiklian said she would be happy to see restrictions begin to ease further, when the health advice dictated it was safe to do so.

The lone glaring mistake by the Falcons' defense in the second quarter was a 45-yard run by Mitch Trubisky after defenders lost sight of the quarterback while focused on receivers in coverage. Fueled by that big run, Chicago scored its first touchdown on the game with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Trubisky to tight end Jimmy Graham. That left the Bears trailing 16-10 heading into halftime.

It is important to determine such a role in a historic perspective as Sharifs themselves need to answer many such questions about their own role as well.
 His speech was followed by two major leaks, one about the meeting of the parliamentary leaders with the army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and the ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, about a week before the APC and the second, meeting of the PML-N leader and Sindh’s former governor Mohammad Zubair.
 The first meeting that lasted about two hours was reportedly held on the invitation of the army chief in regard to the status of Gilgit and Baltistan, which was attended among others by the AJK prime minister as well.
 Since there was no news about any such meeting before the APC, its leak after Nawaz’s speech generated a debate over the breach of trust as that meeting was suppose to be kept ‘off the record’ since neither any press release was issued from the host side nor the guests ie parliamentary leaders including that of the PML-N, the PPP and the JUI-F top leadership.
 The leak, first through sources followed by back-to-back statements and press conferences by veteran and vocal politician- cum federal minister Sh Rashid gave an impression as the political leadership met the military establishment ‘secretly’.
 The Opposition leaders reacted over the leak and said they went on the invitation and not on request from them. However, in the case of meeting between Mohammad Zubair and army chief and ISI chief certainly put the PML-N leadership on the defensive as none other than ISPR DG not only confirmed about such a meeting in the presence of ISI chief but also disclosed that Mr Zubair also discussed about the cases of Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz.
 The PML-N senior leader on his part admitted that he did meet the army chief twice in a year, one in December, during the wedding reception of the son of his brother and federal minister Asad Umar which was informal and then at Islamabad.
 All this followed by Sh Rashid’s constant attack on Nawaz Sharif and he went on to challenge all political leaders who claimed they had never met. He even went on to say that all leaders of the key political parties were created by the establishment. “They are all product of the establishment”.
 Sheikh sb often reminds me of late Pir Pagaro, who always publicly claimed, “I am GHQ man” and never hid it. Now, Sheikh sb though denied he is anyone’s spokesperson, he came under heavy criticism for his recent interviews, statements and press conferences in this connection.
 Prime Minister Imran Khan has also joined the controversy. While talking to news heads of some private TV channels, he claimed that both the PPP and the PML-N are the product of establishment.
 He believes that both Nawaz Sharif and former president Asif Ali Zardari are now out of the system and said his government is under no threat from the Opposition. “If they resign from assemblies I will hold by-elections and they will get no seat,” he claimed. The PPP was created not by the establishment but was formed by anti-establishment forces after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto revolted against Ayub Khan’s cabinet and joined the mainstream politics. However, it is true that he entered the political arena and joined Field Marshal Ayub Khan’s cabinet as junior minister in his 30s.
 The dilemma of Pakistan since its birth on August 14, 1947 has been the constant involvement of the powerful quarters in decision making whether it’s a direct military rule or so-called civilian rule.
 Even if one goes by the statements of Prime Minister Imran Khan and Sh Rashid, its role and interference is more than visible. The latter who had remained in most of the cabinets except during the PPP government from Gen Zia to Gen Pervez Musharraf and from the PML-N to the PTI, knows better than anyone else these non- civilian forces were behind the making and breaking of parties and the government.
 Pakistan is in search of a political and democratic system where civilian supremacy is respected and all institutions remain in their constitutional domain and respect their own oath in office.
 It is also a fact that political parties by and large are undemocratic in their own political domain and seriously lack a culture of democracy within. Thus, if the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) worked as an independent body and had power to register parties which held elections and have enough membership to be called national parties; how can one party be registered in the ECP?
 Only a powerful and independent ECP could ensure transparency in the elections and even in political and democratic culture. Establishment on its part must stop ‘political engineering’ which they have been accused of since long and even in the last few elections. Meeting between the prime minister and the army chief on matters of national, security and strategic importance is understandable but meeting of politicians or vice versa and that too with ‘secrecy’ raised questions for both.
 If we really want to build the image of civilian supremacy at the global level where the general perception is that the power centre is the military establishment and not a civilian government, it is important that all stakeholders should have political maturity. It is unfortunate that even with the release of top political leaders either through NRO or deals being done under pressure from the international establishment, how we could grow as a matured democratic state.
 It is time to learn a lesson from history. Political divide in Pakistan has once led to the creation of Bangladesh and a sense of deprivation among the federating units. We have not yet learned a lesson from the past and still brand all those politicians as ‘traitors’ who talked about civilian supremacy. Unless this issue is resolved there is little chance of democracy taking roots.
