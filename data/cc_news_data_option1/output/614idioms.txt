The award for the best overall digital game goes to this RPG Maker experience that employs a classic technique for reimagining a famous work: switching the perspective character. _You Are The Rats In The Walls_ takes H. P. Lovecraft's 1924 short story of the nearly-same name and, as you've probably guessed, puts the player in the shoes of the titular rats. One thing that makes this game stand out is its excellent and amusing writing, which mines a great deal of comedy from the combination of baroque Lovecraftian prose with more modern, casual dialog. But what sealed its spot as Best Digital Game was that it goes beyond the basics of the RPG Maker engine and actually adds some real gameplay mechanics -- simple ones perhaps, but enough to elevate it beyond the more rigid interactive fiction it could have otherwise been.

See, to me this sounds like a perfect vacation: one that makes me even happier after I get back home. There’s actually a good amount of online discussion surrounding Mr. Roarke and if he’s supernatural or not. (Okay, yes, there are _some_ people who are still very familiar with the show.) I mean, he kind of has to be supernatural, right? Though, I always wondered how the island advertised itself. Maybe it’s addressed in an episode? But is it word of mouth? Is it mainstream advertising? Does Mr. Roarke just supernaturally summon people who need him?

Getting on base and slapping a ball to right field when he needs to, and driving a ball when he needs to.

After majoring in English at Georgetown University, where he also competed in tennis and swimming, Jim became a U.S. Marine lieutenant. That may be one reason he so lauded “not bellyaching, but moxie” ​— ​people with the character to do the right thing, and, if need be, to take a hit and still climb right back into the saddle. After his son Michael, an adventurer who designed and promoted hemp clothing, lost his life in China’s Nanpan River in 2007, it gave Jim some comfort that Michael had swum from relative safety into swift whitewater in a bid to save his girlfriend, who also perished.

WORCESTER -- John Cleese anticipates an agreeable evening at The Hanover Theatre and Conservatory for the Performing Arts on Feb. 15 talking about the uproarious 1975 comedy "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" after its screening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "The audiences are pre-selected to be friendly," Cleese said, because most likely only people predisposed to enjoying such an event are going to buy a ticket to it. After the film is shown, Cleese will have a conversation with the audience and a Q&A via a moderator. Cleese played Sir Lancelot the Brave, a French Taunter and the Black Knight (who gets his arms and legs cut off but keeps fighting) among other roles in Monty Python's satirical send-up of the legend of King Arthur. It was the second movie for the group, which had developed the now-legendary surrealistic BBC TV series "Monty Python's Flying Circus."

"The audience can text questions. She (the moderator) knows which questions are going to get funny answers, and what aren't. It's a very good arrangement," Cleese said of the format for Feb. 15.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    However, there will be at least one person at The Hanover Theatre who won't be as enamored of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" as many in the audience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And now for something completely different, so to speak. That individual would be ... John Cleese.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "I don't think it's as good as most people do, which makes it a very interesting evening," Cleese said. "The first 40 minutes are very good." But later, not to put too fine a point on it, co-director "Terry Gilliam '...... up a lot,' " he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    People are a bit shocked about his opinion, Cleese acknowledged. "People think it's blasphemy."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But he does credit the film with bringing Monty Python's brand of comedy to a wide audience, especially in this country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "A lot of people hadn't seen silly humor like that," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" grossed more than any other British film released in the United States in 1975. Forty-five years later, the film still evidently retains its appeal because Cleese has toured with it stateside before, including a 2017 visit to The Hanover Theatre.

One of the most important things to understand about sports betting is how odds work. If you want to make any money at all, you’ll need to know how to read and understand at least one type of odds. There are three main types, American odds (-200 and +200, for example), decimal odds (1.2 and 3.4, for example), and fractional odds (1/2 and 5/7, for example). Don’t worry, you don’t need to understand all of them. Most sportsbooks will allow you to display odds in your chosen format.

Freedom Service Dogs trains dogs young and old for a career as service animals for veterans with PTSD and people with autism or mobility issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “Service dogs need to be paying attention in case their person has a seizure or a drop in blood sugar,” said Morgan Karol, the dog training manager at Freedom Service Dogs. “A service dog is specifically trained to mitigate an individual's disability.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Karol says the organization helps people live normal lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             “That includes traveling on airplanes, something that can be stressful for those with service dogs, due to crowds, distractions, or untrained animals,” Karol said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In January, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced proposed changes to the rules for animals that can travel in the cabin of airlines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “What we’ve seen over the last three years is frankly a lot of abuse of the current rule,” said Sharon Pinkerton, Senior Vice President of Policy for Airlines for America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The organization advocates for airlines and employees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “It’s almost become a bit of a joke over the last several years about people bringing their pets and trying to pass them off as legitimate service animals,” she said. “The badgers, the snakes, the hive of bees, these are the type of things people were claiming they were emotional support.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Pinkerton said the industry saw a 50 percent increase in animals brought on board from 2017 to 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             “Upwards of a million and a half emotional support and service animals,” Pinkerton said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The proposed changes to the rules would include requiring psychiatric service animals to receive the same training other service animals do. Airlines would be able to continue denying animals who act hostile or pose a health threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “Our crew has reported to us an increase in health conditions with defecation from untrained animals,” Pinkerton said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The definition of a service animal would also be aligned with the Americans with Disabilities Act definition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             “When you start talking about the ADA definition of a service animal, they specifically only recognize dogs and miniature horses,” Morgan said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The proposal would no longer require airlines to allow emotional support animals, or ESAs, on board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “Service animals, comfort animals, it comes together, it’s a blended thing,” said Carol Komitor, Founder of Healing Touch for Animals. “I’ve seen it work where animals, they come into the presence of the person and they’re settled down.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “Some people with PTSD can’t be around crowds and a confined airline can be pretty scary sometimes,” she said. “They can focus on that animal and the animal can focus on the person as well.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “Regardless if it’s a service animal or an ESA, Morgan says there are two important things – that animal has had the appropriate training to do that job and that animal has the appropriate temperament to do that job,” Morgan said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The public has 60 days to submit comments on the proposal.

Hellebores are pretty, easy to grow, deer- and vole-resistant, will take drought and neglect once established, and are long-lived. It is hard to imagine all these wonderful traits in a single perennial. Hellebores have been around for a long time and recently they have become extremely popular because of the breeding work that has been done to create flowers with exotic colors plus different forms and traits.      There are about 15 different species of hellebores and the three that I will mention are known by several different names. This could be one reason for confusion. Christmas rose, Helleborus niger, is not a rose at all, but a very early blooming form of hellebores. It is said to bloom at Christmas, but I find it blooms early January in my garden. The blooms are most often white but can become pink as the flower ages.      Stinking hellebores, Helleborus foetidus, have an unusual odor when the leaves are crushed, hence the name. The foliage is much more serrated than other varieties. The dark green, deeply cut foliage makes a wonderful show, particularly during the winter months. The pendant flowers are a pale green that can open anywhere from December until spring. It is advised not to plant this variety too close to other varieties if you are looking for your plant to self-seed. If this variety cross-pollinates, the seedlings might not look like the parent plant and the leaves might not be serrated.      Lenten rose, Helleborus orientalis, is the most popular and the one that is grown the most. Lenten roses get their common name from the rose-like blooms that flower during the time of Lent, the 40 days before Easter. This plant features large, cup-shaped flowers that come in a broad range of colors. You can find these particular hellebores with flowers of white, pink, rose, rose- purple, almost black-purple, yellow and shades in-between. Plus, they are not limited to solid colors. Hellebores can also have beautiful picotee (dark- edged petals), or spotting or dark centers. The array of coloring seems endless as every year or two another series is developed.      Hellebores are easy to grow and are a wonderful winter-flowering perennial. They like some shade in the summer and are ideal for a woodland garden. If they get too much hot summer sun, the leaves will burn and if the shade is too dense, the plant will not put on as heavy a show of flowers as it would with high shade, shade where the foliage is higher up and some light gets into the area.      When planting hellebores, be sure to amend the soil. This will help the plant develop a good root system. They like a moist soil that is well drained and are quite sensitive to wet feet and will not tolerate a boggy area. You will be rewarded with a plant that can take drought, but it has to be well established first. These plants appreciate a drink of water when the weather is hot and dry in the summer. They are found in nature in limestone soil, but they perform in our acidic soil too.      There are many new hellebores hybrids available today at the local garden centers. Breeders from around the world are working to develop plants with exotic looking flowers and interesting patterns. There are double flower forms that have been developed in recent years and some of the newer ones are quite dramatic when in bloom. Characteristics like flower shapes, unusual color, outward-facing blooms, exotic patterns and strong stems are some of the results they have achieved. It is great to see everything from double purples to reds and even light shades of yellow.      Unless you have sterile hybrids, these plants will self-seed and, over time, you will have a nice collection. Like humans, these seedlings might not be exactly like the parent, but it is amazing how they will self-seed, filling your garden with a sea of color.      Now, I am not one that has a manicured garden, but if you wish to obtain this, you can cut the foliage of the hellebores back in December before the flowers emerge. This will make the flower stand out when in bloom. This is not required, but the foliage will eventually die and new foliage will develop.      Hellebores are typically long-lived plants and do not need to be divided as other perennials require. If you do wish to divide the plants, do so in September or October. Leave at least three buds in each division. This way the plant will have a speedy recovery.   Hellebores have a toxicity that keeps them safe from wandering deer. Living in the country, this is a big help to me since the deer roam freely, wanting to eat some of my other prized plants. Some of the prized hellebores that are available can be expensive, but I can assure you that if you plant them in a site where they are happy, they will outlive you.

There is only one St. Elmo Steak House, at 127 S. Illinois St. in the heart of downtown Indianapolis. It is not part of a chain -- it is a tradition. It began in 1902 and continues to feed its customers in the same location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Don't come to St. Elmo to find potato skins, sauerkraut balls, mozzerella sticks or any typical appetizers -- there is only one appetizer on the menu, and it is the shrimp cocktail, with what's known as the spiciest shrimp sauce available.                                                                                                                                             It will clear the sinuses and possibly bring a tear to your eye, but it is oh so good! It can be ordered with the sauce "watered down," but I don't think staff like to hear the request and really, all they do is add some ketchup, according to our waiter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The restaurant uses more than 48,600 pounds of shrimp annually to serve 135,000 shrimp cocktails each year, and 3,800 gallons of sauce is made in house during a year using 6,500 pounds of horseradish, which evens out to about 18 pounds per day. The sauce is made from fresh horseradish root.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         But don't let the hot hype from the spicy cocktail sauce cloud the dinner menu. Steaks of all kinds top the list, and the steak house serves up more than 162,000 pounds a year, from the most popular filet to the bone-in "cowboy" steak and ribeye to a tomahawk. Also popular are the cherrywood-smoked pork chops, roasted chicken breast and fresh seafood. The sides of brussels sprouts, house-made onion rings, king crab mac 'n cheese and others help to round off a great meal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The restaurant has been a landmark in the downtown area and was named after the patron saint of sailors. It remains in three original buildings that date from 1892 to 1900. The serving area can seat almost 500 patrons. There is not much turnover of restaurant staff and they are 140 strong, with 1,000 years of combined experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The steak house serves as a place for many business meetings, romantic evenings and celebratory family dinners. Its atmosphere lends itself to a step back in time. The 3,000-square-foot second floor offers diners a speakeasy-design lounge. St. Elmo's 2,000-square-foot wine cellar is filled with 12,000 to 15,000 bottles at any time, with the most expensive being a 1902 Pauillac, Chateau Lafite Rothschild, $8,500.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Throughout the historic buildings there are more than 500 framed photos that include many of the famous who have eaten at the steak house. One that stands out is legendary NFL quarterback Peyton Manning. It is told that he often brought new teammates on the Indianapolis Colts to St. Elmo and ordered them a shrimp cocktail, just to see the expression on their face when taking the first bite.

The curious son of a cloth merchant, young Antony was destined to follow in his father’s trade but with an interesting sideline: lens grinding. Gentlemen of the age that we’ve come to call the Scientific Revolution had been using lenses to explore small things. But Antony had some ideas that would improve the simple magnifying glass and give human eyes the capacity of seeing into a tiny world of living creatures previously unknown. The engaging biography with colorful and winsome illustrations communicates the excitement of those days, when a draper with a middle-class education could blaze new trails into the frontiers of science. _(Ages 7-10)_

When Iowans first arrive at their polling stations, they'll first hear pitches from supporters of all the candidates on the ballot. Those supporters will then move to different sides of the room, and caucus-goers will literally take sides and join up in groups with their preferred candidates.


  At that point, the precinct will determine which candidates are viable and which ones are not. Then, anyone caucusing for a non-viable candidate has 15 minutes to join up with the group of any candidate still in the running, or abstain.


  Typically, a candidate needs the support of 15 percent of people in the room to be considered viable.


  At the end of the night, the party leaders at each precinct determine the number of delegates to send to the state party using a mathematical formula. Based on that information from the precinct, the state party then determines how many delegates each candidate earns.

El perder la única nominación de la noche ante 1917 —lo que enfureció a quienes creen que la Academia premia a efectos visuales “más pequeños” le dio a Endgame un nada honroso récord: ser la película más taquillera en irse a casa con cero Oscars. Esto se remonta a las épocas de Gone With The Wind, que fue la primera gran película taquillera, desde que existen los Oscars y que se llevó diez estatuillas.

He was stopped after failing to maintain a single lane of travel and driving 45 mph in a 35 mph zone. As he was slowing down, the driver hit a pile of snow and nearly lost control of his vehicle. After stopping, he and a 20-year-old passenger — who claimed to be 16 — showed signs of being under the influence. The passenger was arrested for interference and being a minor in possession. The driver, who did not speak English, also was arrested. The Gillette Police Department is contacting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to see if the suspects are in the country illegally, Police Lt. Brent Wasson said.

Luisana Lopilato compartio en su perfil de Instagram una reflexion sobre la importancia de no preocuparse por el futuro y vivir el presente. La actriz, que se encuentra en Canada, en pocas semanas se instalara en la Argentina para protagonizar la version teatral de Casados con Hijos, junto a todo el elenco original.

“I wouldn’t be the person I am today if I hadn’t had drugs in my life at some point or another. I had some illuminating experiences—but also it’s fuckin’ stupid, too, you know? So besides the occasional muscle relaxer, no, I don’t do drugs recreationally. I still kinda drink like a fish. I drink and I smoke. But I don’t touch the things. I do love them. They’re like old friends. But sometimes you outgrow your friends.”

 Peter Thomas Vandehei  Ventura - Peter Thomas Vandehei, 90, passed away with his family by his side on February 11, 2020. Peter was born in Salt Lake City, Utah on December 25, 1929, the youngest child of Evan Eugene Vandehei (1889-1977) and Constance Sutcliffe Vandehei (1890-1969).  Peter grew up in Salt Lake City with four older sisters as part of a very active outdoor family. In the summers he hiked, camped and worked for the forest service blazing trails and fighting forest fires and in the winters, he loved to ski and snowshoe in the surrounding mountains. Peter enjoyed competing in sports, including track and field, ski jumping and racing. He placed forth in slalom at the Olympic Trials in Sun Valley, Idaho in the winter of 1951, just missing a place on the Olympic team.  Peter graduated from East High School in 1948. He enrolled in college, but his studies were interrupted by the Korean War when he enlisted in the United States Air Force. Returning to college after the war, he graduated from the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree in Physics in 1956. After college Peter came out to California to work at the Naval Air Station Point Mugu Pacific Missile Test Center, which launched his long career in the field of Optics and Thin Films. He developed and coated lenses for various military projects, the Hubble space telescope, National Ignition Facility laser, various Medical equipment and for Panavision cameras.  During his time at Point Mugu he met many of his lifelong friends who introduced him to surfing in Malibu, C-Street, Mondos, Rincon and other prime spots up and down the California coast. Peter started shaping his own surfboards out of Balsam Wood. A friend introduced him to a pretty blond surfer girl named Phyl. After their surfboards blew off the rack of his car on a surf trip to San Onofre, they spent the next few weeks after work fixing them in the garage of his new home on Loma Vista Road, and their relationship subsequently blossomed.  Peter proposed to Phyllis Ann Kopko on Telescope Peak in Death Valley National Park after she beat him to the summit. They married on March 29, 1958 at Santa Clara Church in Oxnard. They surfed California Street together from 1957 through the early 1970s while raising a family of six children. Later, they hung up their surfboards and joined the Cabrillo Racquet Club, where they spent many years playing tennis with friends and family. Each winter they packed the whole family in the van and headed for the slopes, skiing all over the mountain and leaving no trail or jump untouched. Their life was full of adventure. Pete and Phyl worked hard to build a beautiful home that they shared for more than 58 years. As their family grew, they built 7 additions to the house.  Peter worked for a few different companies prior to starting Infrared Filters, Inc. where he designed and coated lenses until he retired in his late seventies, after which he still consulted for many years.  Peter was preceded in death by his wife Phyllis and son Sverre Vandehei (wife Kim), and his four sisters Betty Edmonds, Gayle Morgan, Joy Brietbarth and Jean Davis. He is survived by his children Sven Vandehei, Heidi Lanning (husband Rex), Leif Vandehei (wife Terri), Schatzi Sovich (husband Jan) and Thor Vandehei (wife Eleanor). He is also survived by thirteen grandchildren - Joshua, Elijah, Rusty, Peter, Ezekiel, Ashley, Rocky, Bailey, Leisl, Brigitta, Taylor, Katarina and Beatrix - and twelve great-grandchildren - Asher, Napthtalia, Hezekiah, Hadassah, Valory, Sverre, twins Adina and Baet, Aurora Grace, Remington, Silas and Tanner too, on his way.  Peter was born during the depression, raised during World War II, served in the Korean War, immigrated to California from Utah to surf, ski and work, married and raised a large family, started his own business and basked in the joy of his creations. Peter passed on his love for the outdoors and adventure to all his children. His last remaining wish was to make it to 90 and the decade in which he was born, 2020. You made it dad! We love you more than words on paper can ever express! Family and friends are invited to a Celebration of Life on March 7, 2020 at 2pm. Please contact schatzisovich@sbcglobal.net for the pending location of the celebration.  Arrangements are under the direction of the JOSEPH P. REARDON FUNERAL HOME & CREMATION SERVICE, 757 East Main Street, Ventura.

PEORIA -- Plenty of good-paying jobs with the U.S. Census effort in central Illinois are still available, and they ought to go to people in this community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That was the message Thursday at an open house and job fair held at the Peoria offices for the Census at 325 W. Romeo B. Garrett Ave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "We've got local jobs, and we're going to be needing local people to be able to make sure we have a full, complete count," Sid Ruckriegel, the at-large Peoria City Councilman who is overseeing the city's effort to get as complete a count of residents as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Ensuring that number is accurate and that no one is left out is critical, Ruckriegel said. Doing so equates to the maximum amount of federal aid to the area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "You name any program that is really a fundamental need, and somewhere those tax dollars are coming into play," he said. "It might be for providing food, it might be providing shelter, emergency care, some infrastructure pieces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "... A lot of what we do around the City Council is really being able to leverage the dollars we have from a local tax base with our federal and state tax dollars," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The jobs themselves range from full time to part time, short term or longer term. And many will kick into gear after the full-blown count gets going in April, and include those efforts to reach people who haven't responded to Census forms or are in hard-to-reach populations, and could carry through until late in the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Pay for many can range between $17 and $23 per hour, Ruckriegel said, and in some instances there can be the ability to work around other demands on one's schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "The flexibility of being able to work your schedule around some of these schedules is really powerful," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            PCCEO will also be the lead outreach agency providing assistance during the Census process, Ruckriegel said.

In the modern period, there is also much in common between Ukraine and Syria. In both countries there is a war, there are refugees—people fleeing and displaced from their homes, and religiously speaking—not everything is going smoothly either, to say the least.

Ginsburg's comments are an indication that if this repeal was challenged in the Supreme Court, it would almost certainly be struck down. The Department of Justice has also issued guidelines saying an amendment whose deadline for ratification has passed cannot be added to the Constitution.However, Democrats say that the original deadline was not part of the amendment, but was a resolution passed by Congress, and therefore could be undone by Congress. Speaking on the House floor ahead of the vote, Democratic Congresswoman Jackie Speier called out Republicans for hypocrisy, saying that those who say the process should restart aren't being honest."You're the same people who admit you won't vote for it!" Speier said. "There can be no expiration date on equality."Republicans also argue that the amendment is unnecessary, as the 14th Amendment provides equal protection under the law, and would be used to undo state abortion restrictions. GOP Congresswoman Jackie Walorski called the vote a "political stunt.""Let's be honest: this is not about equality or women's rights, this is about enshrining unrestricted abortion in the constitution," Walorski said.However, Pelosi countered in her speech that abortion was an "excuse, not a reason" to oppose the ERA."This has nothing to do with the abortion issue," Pelosi said. "It has everything to do with the respect for women."

  Among those not campaigning in Iowa is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who entered the race for the Democratic nominee this winter and chose to instead prioritize on campaigning in other states.


  The 2016 Iowa Democratic caucuses proved to be a preview of what was to come in the general election. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton edged out Sanders, earning 23 delegates to Sanders' 21. In the Republican caucuses that year, Sen. Ted Cruz edged out then-candidate Donald Trump, eight delegates to seven delegates.

The courts upheld the law's ban on sanctuary policies and its key feature: a requirement that police officers, while enforcing other laws, question the immigration status of people suspected of being in the country illegally.

President Donald Trump's address to Congress Tuesday night was more of a campaign speech than a traditional State of the Union message, with an agenda for the current session of Congress.
   
 In actuality, Trump made a very strong case regarding the state of the country during his watch. It illustrated the political paradox that is Donald Trump.
   
 Any other Republican running on Trump's record would be standing on the edge of a probable landslide victory this November. Democrats would be looking at a McGovern-like debacle. Instead, he will be lucky to eke out another Electoral College majority.
   
 Ronald Reagan was always more popular than his policies. When his reforms put a spring back into the step of the economy, he could run an upbeat campaign about it being morning in America again. That's, in part, because Reagan was an upbeat guy. The message rang true and felt authentic.
   
 Trump is considerably less popular than his policies. And it will be hard for him to run an upbeat campaign because he's not an upbeat guy.
   
 Trump's best case is on the economy. To the extent Democrats acknowledge good news about the economy, they claim that it is merely a continuation of the recovery that began under President Obama. No credit due to Trump.
   
 However, the trajectory of the recovery has changed notably under Trump, and his policies do deserve a considerable share of the credit.
   
 The pace of economic growth quickened. One of the larger, and politically most important, differences is wage growth among those without a college degree. It is stronger, and broader, than in many years.
   
 The heart of Trump's tax reform was a sharp reduction in the corporate income tax rate. That increased cash on hand and potential returns on future investments.
   
 Leaving more resources at work in the private sector, and increasing the potential return on future investments, will result in more private sector economic activity. Even things dismissed by liberal critics, and some conservative ones, as an economic waste, such as share buybacks, are actually an efficient way of redeploying capital to more productive uses.
   
 Perhaps equally important was Trump eliminating the regulatory uncertainty that served as an anchor on the economy during the Obama years. Businesses had to assume that the regulatory environment would change, and likely for the worse.
   
 And not just the regulatory environment for their particular sector. Obama overhauled the entire finance and health care industries. And he was in the process of trying to do the same to the energy sector when time ran out.
   
 Trump's deregulation initiatives have lifted the regulatory uncertainty anchor. If there are changes, businesses can assume that they will generally increase their latitude to operate.
   
 There is a third, often overlooked, factor. To the extent Trump's immigration policies have helped create a stasis in the number of foreign-born low-skilled workers in the country, that contributes to the upward push on low-skilled wages.
   
 Trump would claim that his trade policies have contributed as well. But he is on less firm ground here.
   
 Trump's tariffs, and threats of tariffs, have added their own element of uncertainty to the economy, which has deterred the investments in business expansion that otherwise would have flowed from his tax cut.
   
 With China, there's a case to be made that slower growth from impinging the free flow of goods and services is a necessary price to protect American markets from its form of state capitalism. With the rest of the world? Not so much.
   
 The economy isn't everything. But in politics, it's a lot. And Trump has a record that should attract broader support than he is receiving.
   
 That's because Trump has turned American politics into a soap opera starring himself. His management of the national government has been chaotic. His Twitter tantrums roil American politics, inflaming supporters and opponents.
   
 His base likes this and thinks it's necessary given liberal bias in the media and the intemperate attacks regularly directed at Trump. And that is not a view without some foundation.
   
 But the soap opera alienates a lot of voters to whom Trump has a case to make, if he can get them to listen.

The best thing about the park was the people—both the visitors and the city employees. Of course, not everybody enjoyed having me around—some parents warned their children to steer clear of me—but I knew how to make myself liked. I stocked up on free coupon books and copies of Now Magazine, which I dispensed to tourists who passed through, and I bought a bucket of coloured chalk for the kids who came each day to play. Some drew magnificent pictures on the pavement. One, a 12-year-old named Francesca, will surely grow up to be a successful illustrator.

Boorish white people linger in the background throughout the 10-episode first season, swanning into the botanica in yoga pants for some cultural tourism and ignoring the mariachi band hired to enhance the atmosphere of their boozy brunch. But the real gentrification drama happens within Casimiro's family and between other Boyle Heights natives. Chris' efforts to satisfy his boss, an abusive chef who could make or break his career, earn him the scorn of Latinx co-workers; at the taqueria, his high-end menu tweaks mark him as a "coconut" (brown on the outside, white on the inside). Meanwhile, Ana's ethnic identity, sexuality, politics and ambition come into conflict when a gay white man hires her to paint a homoerotic mural on a building he purchased in the neighborhood --and the older woman who operates a store inside it starts losing business. For these millennials, it seems impossible to make their dreams come true without selling out their heritage and their elders.

 VICTOR -- For Dr. Tim Terranova, failure isn't something to run from, but something he embraces.
 "I mean, it's not fun to fail. Nobody likes to fail, but I've always thought that, you know, you've got to, you have to put yourself out there to accomplish stuff," he said.
 As a former deputy superintendent for the West Irondequoit Central School District, Terranova is now looking toward his next challenge, as the new superintendent for the Victor Central School District. Starting Thursday, Terranova will be overseeing operations at the 166-acre campus, rated as the number-one school district in Ontario County for 2020, according to the data rankings company Niche.
 Given how the reputation of the district "spoke for itself," Terranova felt it was worth applying for once the superintendent position opened, even if he wasn't selected.
 "It was like, you know what? I might not get this job. I'm never going to get it if I don't try, and this is a district that really appealed to me. So I applied," he said, adding, "I'm thankful that the board chose me to be the next superintendent."
 Becoming a teacher
 With over 18 years of experience in the public school system, Terranova can't be accused of not being prepared for the job. However, his initial career interests were quite different from the path he eventually chose. As a student who attended the University at Buffalo, Terranova wasn't interested in studying teaching.
 "I was originally looking at, I wanted to study sharks," he said with a laugh.
 "Yeah, so I loved biology. I was actually going to go into marine biology," which is why he graduated with a degree in biological sciences, according to Terranova.
 But after graduating, he slowly found his career interests shifting.
 "I started to think about, well, do I want to go to a med-school type thing, or even law school. But I kept doing volunteer work with camps and youth groups and just did coaching with kids. And I really enjoyed it, so I put plans on hold, and for about a year and a half after I graduated, worked at a Boys and Girls Club" outside of Buffalo, he said.
 Eventually, when Terranova was in his early to mid 20s, he decided to go back to school, earning his teaching degree in 1992, according to LinkedIn.
 Yet after he graduated with a Master's in Elementary Education, positions were scarce in the Buffalo area, so he looked toward Rochester.
 "So my college roommate's parents lived in Rochester, in Brighton. They offered me a place to stay in Rochester, and I ended up working as a teacher's assistant in Brighton. And I lived in my college roommate's parents' house for like four months," Terranova said, adding, "I still keep in touch with them."
 In 1993, Terranova managed to land what he termed a "long-term sub, third grade teaching job" in West Irondequoit, slowly working his way into a permanent third-grade teaching position.
 Yet while Terranova accumulated other responsibilities, including coaching and working as a teacher on special assignment at the high school level, he kept an eye out for bigger opportunities.
 Working together toward a common goal
 While Terranova always enjoyed working with kids as a teacher, when the opportunity came to work as an assistant principal, he "went for it."
 "And you know, assistant principals, those are tough jobs, because you're given a lot of bad news. I mean, you're dealing with student management and discipline."
 Yet while there were challenges in his new role, one of the main takeaways from the job was how "it built really strong relationships with kids and staff," something which continued once he became principal of Dake Junior High.
 "Obviously you still have a lot of strong connections with kids, but you're dealing a lot more with, you know, a hundred staff members. But I enjoyed it. I enjoyed really working together with people kind of towards a common goal, to help kids, you know? That's what it was about."
 Given his work as a coach for the district, Terranova also saw a parallel in his new responsibilities.
 "So it was just a different level of coaching actually, you know? I did a lot of coaching with kids, but I felt like working with adults gave you that same feeling of trying to get a group of people with you to accomplish stuff, so I liked that."
 In 2004, Terranova enrolled in the Teacher's College, which is part of Columbia University, where he eventually earned a doctorate in School Administration. Working in a "cohort program" with a small group of other students, Terranova was able to explore the field of special education, and the impact of collaboration with general education teachers.
 "So I studied a ton of teachers, and the way they worked together and planned together, and it gave me a lot of insights around better ways to promote collaboration between special ed teachers and general ed teachers," he said, adding how it was "a major focus for our district."
 Aside from the practical applications from his research focus, most of which he still refers to today, Terranova also found perseverance as he pursued his doctorate to be an added benefit.
 "When you accomplish hopefully something that's difficult, you learn to persevere, and hopefully be resilient, which is an important trait," he said.
 As Terranova gradually stepped into positions that demanded more leadership, colleagues characterized his approach as collaborative.
 "He's the kind of person who activates leadership in others," said Karen Finter, director of instruction for grades 7 through 12 in West Irondequoit. Having worked with him for over 20 years, Finter has considered Terranova to be a mentor, who's always "focused on the kids."
 Plus, as she put it, "he has a wicked good sense of humor."
 "We're going to miss him terribly," she added,
 Another colleague, Dr. Aaron Johnson, spoke of how instrumental Terranova was after Johnson became the new superintendent of West Irondequoit in March of last year.
 While there were concerns with having a new leader come into the school district, "Tim was really good at keeping an open mind," Johnson said. Terranova helped guide him through "the complexities of the district," which helped Johnson adapt to the position.
 "We became friends," as a result of their working relationship, he added.
 Johnson also praised Terranova for his focus on helping the students in his district, describing it as a "strong sense of purpose."
 Challenges ahead for Victor
 Now with Terranova stepping in as the new superintendent, he aims to foster a climate of "clear and transparent communication" as he begins his new role.
 "I mean, if you think about it, I probably know the least about Victor. There's 750 employees right now. And I'm probably the least knowledgeable around Victor and what makes it tick. But my job is to learn more and more, and listen."
 Currently, Terranova hopes to hold a series of meetings with what he termed "stakeholders," with the goal of completing these conversations by June. These groups include everyone from administrative and teaching departments, to students and external organizations such as the Ontario County Sheriff's Office and the town supervisors.
 "And I think through these entry plan meetings you start to set up those systems of communication that ultimately you then use going forward that's so important," he said.
 One of the current goals the superintendent is looking to carry over from his work in West Irondequoit is expanding the number of teachers of color who work in the district.
 "Our staff is 99% white, and our students are much more diverse. I mean, the world, the nation's much more diverse," Terranova said. "So, there's been challenges trying to find teachers of color, staff of color. So yeah, that's an area that I'm definitely going to pursue."
 While Terranova has done outreach at several historically black colleges and universities, he's often found the competition among recruiters rather steep.
 "One of the sessions I was over there, I was sandwiched between San Diego and San Francisco, in terms of the booth," he said. "And I'm trying to sell us, which is a great place, it's just, you know."
 "So part of what we have to do is grow our own," he said, adding how the creation of programs such as the one he created in West Irondequoit, which fostered relationships with area colleges and helped "generate opportunities for kids who might be interested in teaching someday."
 Another looming challenge Terranova will have to address is the district's budget, which has not received additional state aid despite an increase in students. One possible course of action which is being discussed is to pursue a vote to increase the district's tax cap, which would require a 60% majority vote.
 Either way, once the board does reach a decision, Terranova is hoping to have plenty of open conversations with the public.
 "I think there's got to be clarity and transparency on the decisions that are going to be made, and then we get public input on that," he said.
 No matter how discussions around the district's budget unfold, Terranova is optimistic the community will be receptive.
 "There's so much to do, and so many people that have a stake in the school district, that you'd hope that if you find a solid plan and clearly articulate it, that people will understand the importance of it, and help us communicate that to all constituents," he said.

The story was sensational. A small, struggling congregation of some 30 elderly attendees is scheduled to close this summer, only to relaunch in the fall with a new, young pastor, new décor, and a new worship style, but without its aging members. _Pioneer Press_ reported that church leaders at the Grove United Methodist Church (UMC) had asked elderly members not to participate in the relaunch and to worship elsewhere for two years before “reapplying” for membership. Accusations of age discrimination followed. Major media picked up the story, painting it as a case of youth-obsessed culture run amok.

Penn, who is in the UFC Hall of Fame, was supposed to make a comeback last year, but league president Dana White said he would not compete again after a video surfaced of him getting into a fight.


  "He won't fight again, that's it," White told ESPN in September. "That's a wrap. It's not even that this was the last straw. I didn't love him continuing to fight anyway. But with the relationship that he and I have -- he gets me on the phone, begging me for another fight; it's hard to turn him down -- after what I saw in that video, BJ needs to, you know, he needs to focus on his personal life before he thinks about fighting."


  Penn's last fight was at UFC 237 and lost to Clay Guida via unanimous decision. That was his seventh consecutive loss, which is a UFC record.

  "I know I am on a losing streak," Penn told BJPenn.com. "I think they said it is the longest in UFC history or something. But that being said, I am not going out there and getting knocked unconscious. There are ton of guys, who would be considered in their prime, who still get knocked out cold - even this past weekend. I still feel good and the desire to compete is still there.


  "It was a good scrap with Clay, who is a really tough fight for anybody at 155 [pounds]. You know what they say, Babe Ruth set a record for most strikeouts too right. But in all seriousness, I do this because I love it. Anderson Silva said it best; never feel sorry for the lion, because the lion doesn't feel sorry for himself when he is surrounded by a bunch of hyenas ready to die."

However, the plan for Shrunk!, or whatever the new Honey, I Shrunk the Kids movie is being called, appears to call for Rick Moranis to have a more significant role, at least based on the initial report from DisInsider which turned out to be accurate. That might be part of why it appealed to him enough to come on board. The majority of the work Rick Moranis has done in the last 20 years has been voice work, which has worked for him because it's something he said he could do from home.

As the criticism continued, the term "prednisone" also began to trend alongside Judd's name as other defended the actress, who has opened up about using the steroid in the past to treat sinus infections. Swelling and weight gain in the face are common side effects of prednisone.

The UN has reached a new low. The UN Human Rights Council, usually in the news because it includes countries with the worst records of human rights abuse in the world, has now targeted companies that do business in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. The so-called blacklist includes 112 companies with the aim of letting the world know who it is that works in Israel's alleged "occupied territories."


  The publication of the list has been in the works since 2016. Countries with the worst human-rights records, such as Cuba and Venezuela, pushed the list due to their anti-Israel views, not because of an attachment to international law. The Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation also supported the list, neither of which are known for having members with stellar human-rights records.


  Unsurprisingly, the UN does not have a global standard for how it labels companies that operate in different disputed areas, such as Crimea, Kashmir, Afrin, Northern Cyprus or Western Sahara. As usual, the Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has merely replicated the antisemitism of previous eras, targeting Israel the way global antisemites target Jews. There is no reason Israel's role in the West Bank is especially unique. Corporations that do business in the West Bank are no more involved in human-rights abuses than those accused of fueling such abuses from the Gulf to Asia.


  As Lahav Harkov wrote in Thursday's Post, there is no explanation for why some companies active in the West Bank, in the categories the UN mentions, are on the list of 112 while others are not. The UN supposedly seeks to target companies involved in surveillance, demolition, pollution and hindering the Palestinian economy. The list includes Motorola, Airbnb, General Mills and TripAdvisor, among others. This is confusing, since TripAdvisor enables users to review places in Palestinian areas. Why punish a company that assists people in finding tourism opportunities in Palestinian areas merely because the same company might highlight restaurants that are also owned by Israeli citizens?


  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will contest the decision with all of its strength and will boycott those who try to boycott it. President Reuven Rivlin said the companies deserve support, and former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also slammed the list.


  The Palestinians want to use the report to go after companies. This puts a target on these companies and their legal departments, which will now have to examine potential ramifications. Depending on how the companies respond, this could have economic ramifications for Israel and the Palestinians. Companies may seek to pursue disclosure on the methodology used to place them on the list, contesting their inclusion.


  Israel must work with its partners in the international community to oppose both this list and the biased Human Rights Council. The council is routinely a home for the worst abusers of human rights, a kind of "old boys' club" used to shield countries from criticism and distract the world by singling out Israel.


  As such, the council is the embodiment of antisemitism, holding a regular agenda item against Israel at each of its three annual sessions. The item calls Israel to "immediately end its occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory," without any mention of Palestinian terrorism, and expresses concern at "the suffering of Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan," without holding Syrian President Bashar Assad accountable for massacring his own citizens.


  In 2018, the US left the UNHRC due to its anti-Israel slant, with then-US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley calling it a "cesspool of political bias." Israel, which was not a member, cut ties with the body immediately after, but continued contacts with the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the professional arm of the UNHRC. Now, Jerusalem has completely cut ties with the office's commissioner Michelle Bachelet as well.


  We welcome that move, as it targets the UN's double standards when it comes to Israel.


  For years, Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaigners have sought to target companies and celebrities who do business in Israel, but they have mostly failed to harm Israel's economy or foreign trade. Let's hope that the international companies named on this new blacklist also realize that it has no teeth and decide to give it the zero attention it deserves.

Tasting notes: Owner Ashley Jacot De Boinod explains that this is one of her year-round staples because it’s one of the best-sellers. The signature yeast doughnut is coated in American buttercream and sprinkled in breadcrumbs. “It’s one of the OGs and it’s a great doughnut because I’m all about no-waste, and the toasted crumb topping is actually from the ugly doughnut children that didn’t make the cut," says de Boinod. The sisters love it because it’s the doughnut they first fell in love with.

Meanwhile, the number of people infected with the virus aboard a quarantined cruise ship in Japan continues to tick upward. Since the Diamond Princess arrived at the Japanese port of Yokohama on Feb. 3, at least 218 people on board have tested positive for the new coronavirus by Thursday morning -- with 44 new cases in the past 24 hours. At least one quarantine officer has also been infected, according to Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.

If you're a serious action movie fan, then you're already familiar with 2011's The Raid, known stateside as The Raid: Redemption. It was directed by Gareth Evans and is generally agreed to be one of the best pure action films ever made. Plans for an American remake have been around for years, though the wheels on the project have been turning quite slowly, when they haven't stopped altogether.

The goal for Naidu, ultimately, is to build an archive of poems, which currently exists as a personal collection from various workshops that they have conducted. They want to raise funds to showcase the poems in galleries and on digital platforms to generate visibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     “It’s important because when you look at India, there is such a deep historical erasure around queerness through British colonial laws, current ruling governments and education systems. That’s why these archival projects are so important in post-colonial countries where we are unearthing our histories and understand queerness, not through Western identities,” observed the 35-year-old poet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Currently working on their first poetry book _Territory_ , Naidu often finds themselves at the crossroads of queerness and colonialism. “My dad was a Telugu speaker and my mom spoke Kannada. But growing up in the States, they didn’t want to teach me my mother tongues because they feared I wouldn’t integrate well,” informed Naidu. “I don’t have a command of either my native languages [which] I was denied because of racist practices within the education and social systems, so now when I do this workshop I still do it in colonial language, so there’s something to critique there.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Naidu finds it noteworthy that queer archival work in post-colonial countries like India is largely limited to English, a colonial lingua franca. “These are interesting intersections to explore as the project grows, and ideally we want to explore how does poetry look for queer people in their native languages and in languages that haven’t been colonised,” they concluded.

It turns out that Katherine was something of a fiction of her own creation. Her secret was that she was born in Herne Hill and began life in London; it didn’t stop her presenting herself as a committed Republican. But what Actress makes clear is that a real actress can turn her life into art, even as she disintegrates as a woman in tandem with her career. She remains elusive even after death when her daughter does find out about the manner of her conception.

The episode with the Baio cousins opens with two separate plotlines as they arrive by hot air balloon.

Hey, do you think you’re getting just one Baio this episode?

Humorist Finley Peter Dunne in 1901 said, “The Supreme Court follows the election returns,” but this was no laughing matter near the end of the century. Republican operatives had assured ­pro-life leaders that Reagan nominee Anthony Kennedy (1988) and Bush nominee David Souter (1990) would vote to overturn _Roe v. Wade_. In 1992’s _Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey_ case, though, they instead followed the Gallup polls and smashed pro-life hopes by keeping _Roe_ alive.

This alternative will be especially difficult to imagine in the coming months, as politicians and those who cover them increasingly invoke an alarmist view of politics that extends no further than November 3, 2020. However, it is doubtful that a strategy meant to instrumentalize voters is likely to win them over in the long term. The Sanders and Warren campaigns have shown that engaging with the real grassroots is at least as effective as manufacturing "local" support, and in the end, those who choose the president are not just voters, but citizens. Any functioning democracy needs journalists and politicians who treat them as such.

Inoltre, è stato possibile rilevare che l’agenzia di “porteur”, a fronte delle prestazioni rese a favore del casinò, aveva percepito nei citati anni un correspettivo complessivo di oltre 5 milioni di euro che, in maniera illecita, attraverso la falsa residenza all’estero dichiarata della società, non era stato sottoposto a tassazione in Italia. Al termine delle indagini sono state denunciate alla competente Autorità Giudiziaria n. 13 persone responsabili, a vario titolo, dei reati di associazione a delinquere, bancarotta fraudolenta, riciclaggio ed omessa presentazione delle dichiarazioni fiscali. Inoltre, nei confronti della società di “porteur” e del proprio socio unico e legale rappresentante, sono state eseguite due distinte verifiche fiscali per il recupero a tassazione ai fini delle imposte sui redditi e dell’I.R.A.P. dei redditi prodotti in Italia, per un ammontare complessivo di oltre 14 milioni di euro. Il risultato dell’operazione di servizio conferma il quotidiano impegno della Guardia di Finanza al contrasto di tutti quei fenomeni illeciti, tra i quali il riciclaggio di denaro e l’evasione fiscale, in grado di inquinare i circuiti legali dell’economia e di alterare le condizioni di concorrenza, compromettendo la corretta allocazione e distribuzione delle risorse. In particolare, l’evasione fiscale produce effetti negativi per l’economia, ostacola la normale concorrenza fra imprese, danneggia le risorse economiche dello Stato ed accresce il carico fiscale per i cittadini onesti.

 Ricky Z - Pilot of the Airwaves has signed off.  Frederick S. Zirpoli, Sr., local Doo Wop DJ and car cruise host from Milanville, died Tuesday morning at Wayne Memorial Hospital in Honesdale as a result of a battle with a long-standing illness. He was 73 years old.  Born on May 20, 1946 in Newark, NJ, he was the son of the late Anthony Zirpoli and Sonia Babushik. Raised in nearby Union, NJ, he was a member of the United States Navy before moving to Budd Lake, NJ where he worked as a Mt. Olive Township Police Officer before retiring due to a work-related injury.  Rick, as he liked to be called, was a lover of all types of music, but had a special place in his heart for the sounds of Doo Wop which reminded him of the streets where he grew up.  Similarly, he loved classic cars and loved collecting them, always eager to show them off at a nearby car cruise.  He was especially proud of his 55' Chevy Bel Air Convertible, a car that he owned when he was young and was thrilled to be able to find again later in life.    His gravely voice and knowledge of music soon led to hosting duties at those car cruises and, soon after, work as a DJ.  He loved finding great music to bring to the scene and share with fans.   He was even know to appear on local radio shows that rocked the oldies and loved being part of the broadcasts.   On top of that, he also loved collecting a wide variety of antiques. From kitchen shakers to Depression glass to restoring old Hoosier cabinets, he loved decorating his home and property with all of his amazing finds. He also enjoyed collecting and building model trains and had spent years building tiny replicas of nearby Honesdale.   Rick Zirpoli was one-of-a kind who lived life to the fullest.  A dear friend too many and a true character, he will be sorely missed.   He was greeted with open arms by his father Anthony and mother Sonia.  Surviving are his ex-wife Judith of Guilford, NY, his sons Frederick Zirpoli, Jr. and his wife Elizabeth of Milanville, Patrick Zirpoli and his wife Tracie of Milanville, and Christopher Zirpoli and his wife Kelly of Boston, MA; grandchildren Jessica, Melissa and her husband Kris Corey, Anthony, Michael, and Buddy; great grandchildren Carmine, Vincent, Avah, and Abigal.  Private Cremation took place at Lake Region Crematory, Lake Ariel and a memorial car cruise is being planned for the spring.  Arrangements have been entrusted to and under the direction of James Wilson Funeral Home, Lake Ariel.

  Foundation announces Emerson Hospital donation to Leadership Fund


  The Natick-based Foundation for MetroWest this week announced Emerson Hospital is the first organization to donate to the foundation's Business Leadership Fund. The $40,000 gift will help ensure that the Foundation for MetroWest can continue to respond to the most pressing needs facing MetroWest communities. The fund was made possible through a partnership between the foundation and the Middlesex Savings Charitable Foundation and will increase its impact as other businesses contribute. "Emerson Hospital is so proud to be the first to donate to the MetroWest Business Leadership Fund. As the largest employer in Middlesex County, we believe it is important to lead by example," said Christine Schuster, president and CEO of Emerson Hospital. "I have seen firsthand how, in their own quiet way, the foundation is making a difference in multiple areas. We are thrilled to partner on this endeavor with organizations who share similar missions to care for the community." Schuster was first introduced to the community foundation by her daughters, both of whom have participated in its Youth in Philanthropy program. The Business Leadership Fund provides businesses the opportunity to make a difference in their own backyard, to have employees involved in their community and to make sure that funding is available where it is needed most. Middlesex Savings Charitable Foundation will match any business' gift of $1,000 or more, up to a total of $250,000. Emerson Hospital is based in Concord. Middlesex Savings Bank is based in Natick.

JEFFERSON CITY — Every weekday at noon since Jan. 27, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Director Randall Williams gathers his outbreak response team for a meeting on coronavirus.Missouri has yet to have a confirmed case of what officials are now calling COVID-19, but about 20 people statewide are being monitored for the novel viral infection originating from Wuhan, China. While 15 cases have been confirmed in the U.S. so far, tens of thousands of people have been infected worldwide and more than 1,300 have died. Global — and local — fears of the spread of the respiratory virus are fueling concerns about a lack of preparation in the U.S.Missouri health department staff have been working overtime preparing for if, and when, the cases come by ensuring they have adequate supplies of non-expired protective gear like masks and planning how to trace the movements of those who have come in contact with potentially infected people.They’re also helping set up coronavirus testing capabilities at a regional lab based here in the state capital to evaluate potential cases from Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has started shipping testing kits around the country.Coronavirus may not require a front-line battle yet in places like Missouri as it does in states with confirmed cases, such as Washington, California, Illinois and Texas. But it’s still taxing public health officials in Missouri, which has one of the lowest levels in the nation for public health spending per person. And they, like health officials in other states, are stuck in the tricky position of trying not to be over- or underprepared for a potential public health crisis that may never come.Missouri’s Legislature is considering an additional $300,000 in emergency funding for events like coronavirus. This money is vital for responding to outbreaks in the state, Williams said, including more common concerns like mumps and measles or ongoing fights against hepatitis A and tuberculosis.However, according to Williams, the Legislature denied such an appeal for $300,000 last year.“We are essentially like a fire department, right? People want us to be available when there’s a fire,” the director said. “But when there’s not a fire, they don’t really give a lot of thought to it.”Limited budgetAs state officials gear up for possible problems from coronavirus, local health departments in Missouri are at a disadvantage because they have lost staff amid state budget cuts, according to Lindsey Baker, research director for the Missouri Budget Project, a nonprofit focused on public policy decisions.Similar patterns hold true across the nation. Almost a quarter of local health department jobs have been lost since 2008, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials, and a quarter of local health departments experienced budget cuts last year.While federal funding has supplemented public health funding in Missouri, Baker said, the federal cash comes with strict rules on how it can be used.Williams stressed that, despite Missouri’s limited budget, his state ranked in the top tier for emergency preparedness by Trust for America’s Health, a nonprofit advocacy group promoting public health.Money notwithstanding, viruses like COVID-19 force the staff to work longer hours, according to state epidemiologist Dr. George Turabelidze, as the health department juggles its existing workload with pressing concerns.“Everything else is happening — it’s not like we can switch, we have to do all this at once,” Turabelidze said.Plus, he added, since this outbreak involves world travelers arriving at all times of the day, his staff has had to work weekends to track down where travelers have come from and whether they’ve had contact with infected people. For now, salaried staffers — who do not receive overtime — are expected to shoulder the extra load.Even as they work extra hours, some routine health department matters such as onsite sewage inspections “get put in the back seat,” said Adam Crumbliss, chief director of Missouri’s Division of Community and Public Health.If coronavirus reaches a pandemic level — in which it spreads worldwide — Crumbliss said the National Guard could be activated.Relying on existing relationship and stockpiles  Vital to any public health emergency response are the underlying relationships, stressed Paula Nickelson, the state’s program coordinator for health care system readiness. Knowing whom to call and having an established rapport with key health care providers such as the Missouri Hospital Association is critical during a crisis.As is experience. Nickelson said the state’s response capabilities were tested and strengthened during a successful practice transport of a hypothetical Ebola patient from St. Louis to the University of Iowa in May.Through that exercise, they learned that the material of their ISOPODs — portable, see-through isolation units that quarantine infected patients while allowing them to still see and speak to other people — was so thick it made it hard to hear those inside. Now, they are equipping them with walkie-talkies.Another major question in recent days is a potential onslaught of shortages of protective medical equipment — everything from masks to latex gloves ― often manufactured in China. Nickelson said the state has assessed what materials are on hand.“They’re fairly small amounts,” she said. “What we found over the course of a decade is that a lot of that stuff sits on the shelf, doesn’t necessarily get used, and so we’re better off to have just-in-time, vendor-managed processes in place.”Still, Nickelson noted, that could become a problem for everyone if a pandemic occurs and those vendors become swamped with orders.“This is by no means a sprint,” Crumbliss said. “This is a long wind race.”

The repeal was approved with a vote of 232 to 183, with five Republicans joining all Democrats in voting in favor of the legislation.Several Democratic congresswomen wore white during the vote, in honor of the suffragist movement which led to the ratification of the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote in 1920. Others wore purple, traditionally a color associated with the women's rights movement. Many visitors watching the proceedings in the gallery also were clad in white, adorned with green buttons promoting the ERA. When the resolution received enough votes to pass, some on the House floor and in the visitors' gallery cheered.

UPDATED at 9:45 a.m. Thursday with chargesBERKELEY — The father of a sixth- grade girl stormed onto a school bus with a loaded pistol, threatened a new bus driver and encouraged students to fight, officials said.The man, upset that a student had been fighting with one of his kids, pointed the pistol at the bus driver, two other adults and seven children, saying, "You got what you wanted."St. Louis County prosecutors on Wednesday charged Christian M. Goodson with two counts of unlawful use of a weapon and seven counts of endangering the welfare of a child. All of those charges are felonies. Goodson also faces misdemeanor charges of second-degree property damage and fourth-degree assault.No one was injured in the incident just before 7 a.m. Wednesday at Fay and Canyon drives, said Kevin Hampton, a spokesman for the Ferguson-Florissant School District.Goodson, 31, was being held Thursday in the St. Louis County Jail, in lieu of $100,000 cash bail. Goodson lives in the 6300 block of Abbott Drive in Berkeley. He had no attorney listed as representing him.Tangie Francwar, principal of the Johnson-Wabash Sixth Grade Center, reported the disturbance to school parents in a letter shortly after it happened. She said the parent who forced his way onto the bus was on board for 37 seconds. Berkeley police later arrested him.Berkeley Police Officer Mike Wallish said in court papers that Goodson had a loaded Highpoint pistol in his hand. Two of his children were on the bus, and he became angry that a student was fighting one of his children, Wallish said.When the driver wouldn't let Goodson board the bus, Goodson used the pistol to break the glass on the school bus door, Wallish said. Fearing Goodson would open fire, a district employee who was riding the bus as a monitor then opened the door and let Goodson step onto the bus, Wallish said.According to Wallish, Goodson walked up the stairs of the bus and pushed the female bus driver. After he pointed the gun at everyone on board, the middleschoolers ran to the back of the bus, Wallish said. Goodson then took his two children and left, police said.Police said they arrested Goodson later and recovered a loaded pistol.Francwar's description of the incident said the parent had encouraged students to fight. The police summary doesn't mention that.The bus carried nine students, a new bus driver, a veteran bus driver who was mentoring the new one, and another staff member who was riding as a bus monitor because of previous disruptions and fights on the bus.Before the father boarded the bus, Hampton said, there had been a fight among some students waiting at the bus stop. The fight continued when they boarded the bus on the way to school.Hampton declined to discuss specific student suspensions in this case. But, in general, Hampton said, students who were fighting and violating district policy could be suspended by the principal for up to 10 days. Longer suspensions could be handed down by the district superintendent.Hampton said the new bus driver who was threatened hasn't quit. "She was back at it today," Hampton said Thursday.

The award for the best combination of material from multiple public domain sources goes to this Twine-based interactive fiction that clearly had such remixing at the heart of its mission. _192X_ weaves together the Buster Keaton film _Sherlock Jr._ , the Yevgeny Zamyatin novel _We_ , and George Gershwin's _Rhapsody in Blue_ -- all works from 1924 (and thanks to the designer for noting that the game only uses the now-public-domain composition by Gershwin, not any of the still-copyrighted recordings). Moreover, it's another of the entries that brought the ideas of public domain material and remixing into the game itself, resulting in (as the designer describes it) "a game about the art we leave behind for the future, and what we allow the future to do with it". The writing is compelling and often funny, the interactivity is simple but designed with care and subtlety that enhances the story, and as one of our judges put it, "my hat is off to the creator for having the guts to even try to tell a Buster Keaton movie in words alone."

Thursday the company didn't skip a beat as it continued to hit the market with fresh news. Barrick gold stock soared on the back of an update on progress in Senegal. Teranga Gold and Barrick obtained approvals from the Government of Senegal to close the previously announced acquisition of a 90% interest in the Massaqa Gold Project.

The best thing about the park was the people—both the visitors and the city employees. Of course, not everybody enjoyed having me around—some parents warned their children to steer clear of me—but I knew how to make myself liked. I stocked up on free coupon books and copies of _Now Magazine,_ which I dispensed to tourists who passed through, and I bought a bucket of coloured chalk for the kids who came each day to play. Some drew magnificent pictures on the pavement. One, a 12-year-old named Francesca, will surely grow up to be a successful illustrator.

Most people assume some teachers just have a special "it" that makes children pay attention to them, while others don't. But when Doug Lemov, a former teacher and principal who is one of the main characters in my book, studied great teachers, he found that what looked like magic was actually technique. One example is the technique called "What to Do." Instead of focusing on what students have done wrong, great teachers describe in painstaking detail exactly what they expect them to do instead.

Peter was born in Salt Lake City, Utah on December 25, 1929, the youngest child of Evan Eugene Vandehei (1889-1977) and Constance Sutcliffe Vandehei (1890-1969).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Peter grew up in Salt Lake City with four older sisters as part of a very active outdoor family. In the summers he hiked, camped and worked for the forest service blazing trails and fighting forest fires and in the winters, he loved to ski and snowshoe in the surrounding mountains. Peter enjoyed competing in sports, including track and field, ski jumping and racing. He placed forth in slalom at the Olympic Trials in Sun Valley, Idaho in the winter of 1951, just missing a place on the Olympic team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Peter graduated from East High School in 1948. He enrolled in college, but his studies were interrupted by the Korean War when he enlisted in the United States Air Force. Returning to college after the war, he graduated from the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree in Physics in 1956. After college Peter came out to California to work at the Naval Air Station Point Mugu Pacific Missile Test Center, which launched his long career in the field of Optics and Thin Films. He developed and coated lenses for various military projects, the Hubble space telescope, National Ignition Facility laser, various Medical equipment and for Panavision cameras.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                During his time at Point Mugu he met many of his lifelong friends who introduced him to surfing in Malibu, C-Street, Mondos, Rincon and other prime spots up and down the California coast. Peter started shaping his own surfboards out of Balsam Wood. A friend introduced him to a pretty blond surfer girl named Phyl. After their surfboards blew off the rack of his car on a surf trip to San Onofre, they spent the next few weeks after work fixing them in the garage of his new home on Loma Vista Road, and their relationship subsequently blossomed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Peter proposed to Phyllis Ann Kopko on Telescope Peak in Death Valley National Park after she beat him to the summit. They married on March 29, 1958 at Santa Clara Church in Oxnard. They surfed California Street together from 1957 through the early 1970s while raising a family of six children. Later, they hung up their surfboards and joined the Cabrillo Racquet Club, where they spent many years playing tennis with friends and family. Each winter they packed the whole family in the van and headed for the slopes, skiing all over the mountain and leaving no trail or jump untouched. Their life was full of adventure. Pete and Phyl worked hard to build a beautiful home that they shared for more than 58 years. As their family grew, they built 7 additions to the house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Peter worked for a few different companies prior to starting Infrared Filters, Inc. where he designed and coated lenses until he retired in his late seventies, after which he still consulted for many years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Peter was preceded in death by his wife Phyllis and son Sverre Vandehei (wife Kim), and his four sisters Betty Edmonds, Gayle Morgan, Joy Brietbarth and Jean Davis. He is survived by his children Sven Vandehei, Heidi Lanning (husband Rex), Leif Vandehei (wife Terri), Schatzi Sovich (husband Jan) and Thor Vandehei (wife Eleanor). He is also survived by thirteen grandchildren - Joshua, Elijah, Rusty, Peter, Ezekiel, Ashley, Rocky, Bailey, Leisl, Brigitta, Taylor, Katarina and Beatrix - and twelve great-grandchildren - Asher, Napthtalia, Hezekiah, Hadassah, Valory, Sverre, twins Adina and Baet, Aurora Grace, Remington, Silas and Tanner too, on his way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Peter was born during the depression, raised during World War II, served in the Korean War, immigrated to California from Utah to surf, ski and work, married and raised a large family, started his own business and basked in the joy of his creations. Peter passed on his love for the outdoors and adventure to all his children. His last remaining wish was to make it to 90 and the decade in which he was born, 2020. You made it dad! We love you more than words on paper can ever express! Family and friends are invited to a Celebration of Life on March 7, 2020 at 2pm.

Blockades of abortion centers peaked in 1992 with 83 and were already down to 25 in 1994, but that year President Bill Clinton signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Protesters who blocked entrances, trespassed on facility property, or stopped cars from entering parking lots now faced up to a $10,000 fine and six months’ jail time for a first offense. A second conviction would bring up to 18 years in prison and fines of up to $25,000. In 1995 the number of blockades decreased to five, and soon there were none. The forced end to OR prominence was a public opinion blessing in disguise.

“I personally don’t like it,” O’Regan said. “If I could choose I would never want to play a weekday game. I think our crowd is too good. They will still come out and support, but it’s not what I’d want to do. But it’s one of those things for us, wherever, whenever we better come to play. Charleston is much improved from last year.”


  The Cougars (11-11, 4-7) are coming off back-to-back losses, but are also the team that handed first-place Drexel its only CAA loss. Latrice Perkins leads the way for Charleston, averaging 13.9 points and 5.6 rebounds per game. But it’s mostly been a balanced attack for the Cougars that at times has caused good teams quite a bit of trouble.


  Of course, the Dukes are awfully tough to beat when they are playing their best. One such instance was last Sunday when JMU put an 81-39 beating on Towson. While the Dukes have lost two CAA road games, they’ve been close to unstoppable at home, winning conference games at the Convo by an average of 25 points.

Sickle cell is almost exclusively a black disease, Andy Lord, lobbyist for the foundation, said. About 60% of cases in Georgia come from rural areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Jeanette Nu'Man, operations manager for the foundation, told CNHI that out of all orphan or rare diseases, sickle cell has historically been underfunded and under researched. The areas most in need, she said, are going to be most impacted by cuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “These are people who are sick and dying because they don't have access to care — especially living outside of Metropolitan Atlanta,” she said. “Everybody doesn't want to live in metropolitan Atlanta. They shouldn't have to move to Atlanta to get care. They shouldn't have to move to Augusta to get care. They should be able to access care where or at least near where they live.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Dollars from previously allocated funding for the foundation have gone toward opening access for patients including funding for community health workers who coordinate routine care for patients in areas with high rates of the disease — Augusta, Columbus, Savannah, Macon and Atlanta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            These workers reduce the need for acute care, reliance on emergency rooms and overall costs, Nu'Man said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “The whole focus of the funding, of how we use the funding, that we get from the state is to improve access to care,” Nu'Man said. “What is happening in Georgia, which is what's happening in many other states, is that adults have very limited access to care and because of that limited access to care, they have such poor outcomes.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Hematologists in Georgia are few and far between. The foundation’s most expensive endeavor is bringing hematologists to under-served areas. It also provides non-specialty doctors understanding of and training on how to treat sickle cell disease. With the cuts, Nu'Man said, they’ll most likely have to reduce the number of times they can bring in hematologists to provide services and cut down training.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “If you're not close to Metropolitan Atlanta, if you're not close to Augusta University, you're really kind of out of luck when it comes to hematologists," she said, "because they’re low in number, even in those locations, but outside of those cities there are almost none.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            A 2019 brief from the policy center reported that many of the children living with sickle cell face long drives to treatment and limited appointments for specialized care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In the last year, Lord said, the foundation has done four large physician trainings. The foundation has screened over 100,000 Georgians to date with mobile testing units. Out of those screenings, they detected over 10,000 cases where the patient did not know they had it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “That is a direct result,” he said. “That is directly funded by the funds this committee and this body has allowed us.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Lord has the sickle cell trait himself, but lived most of his life without knowing. It wasn’t until doctors discovered his son was born with the trait that he was tested, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “There are many of Georgians who also don’t know,” he said.

Jimmy and Scott Baio’s fantasy is to be famous rock stars, in a band they play in along with their two younger siblings, The Four Collins. You see, their parents are “lost at sea” (was being lost at sea more common in the '70’s?) and the four siblings have been split up and placed in four separate foster homes.

More than a 100 US service members have been diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injuries following an Iranian attack on US forces in Iraq, injuries President Donald Trump has repeatedly downplayed as "not very serious."


  "There's nothing mild about a brain injury," Michael Kaplen, a brain-injury lawyer and a lecturer at The George Washington University Law School, told Insider recently, explaining that the term "trivializes a very serious and significant injury."


  The word "mild" has "become misused to characterize what a brain injury is in terms of its consequences," he added.

The US market remains a goldilocks investment environment where everything is just right with a relatively strong economy coinciding with low inflation, Schutte said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But the more investors who get off of the sidelines and back into the market, the better it is for stocks: "There's still a lot of cash on the sidelines, which is why I think markets could still move higher," Schutte told CNN Business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    This means investors shouldn't worry about the market's almost daily all-time highs and should jump on the bandwagon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In 2019, stocks were helped higher by the Federal Reserve's shift to loosen monetary policy, which outweighed concerns about the US-China trade war. The S&P 500 climbed nearly 29% last year, its best performance since 2013.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Worries about trade have receded since the United States and China agreed to a 'phase one' trade deal and Congress approved the USMCA deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. This has helped lift stocks, as trade was the biggest point of uncertainty last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Being out of the market at the moment is one of the biggest mistakes you can make," said Matt McCall, founder and president of Penn Financial Group, on CNN Business' digital live show Markets Now on Wednesday.

Checkered flags, bragging rights, the rookie of the year award -- and the pressure to keep the high-profile jobs -- are all up for grabs. Each hopes to finish at the top of their class.

For the last one, I didn’t really know what capacity I was going to come back in or if I was going to come back. I think they’re a year away from filming, I think it would be great if I could do a third one. But you never know, especially with all the stuff that happened in Endgame. Right now, Marvel’s in a situation where they can crush some expectations, they’re gonna have to crush some expectations of other characters, not just mine, so hopefully I make the cut.

Today, the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, and the Honourable Bill Morneau, Minister of Finance, launched a consultation to examine how to strengthen corporate transparency. The Government is seeking feedback from Canadians and subject matter experts on the consultation paper entitled Strengthening Corporate Beneficial Ownership Transparency in Canada, which examines options for the creation of a public registry of individuals who own and control corporations.

"Without the reopening of businesses, in the short term, it will affect the supply of medical material and ... in the long run, it will affect the supply of all kinds of production and life materials and will make the control and prevention efforts on the front line unsustainable. The target of defeating the epidemic will not be reached," Cong said at a news conference.

Ricky Z - Pilot of the Airwaves has signed off.  Frederick S. Zirpoli, Sr., local Doo Wop DJ and car cruise host from Milanville, died Tuesday morning at Wayne Memorial Hospital in Honesdale as a result of a battle with a long-standing illness. He was 73 years old.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Born on May 20, 1946 in Newark, NJ, he was the son of the late Anthony Zirpoli and Sonia Babushik. Raised in nearby Union, NJ, he was a member of the United States Navy before moving to Budd Lake, NJ where he worked as a Mt. Olive Township Police Officer before retiring due to a work-related injury.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Rick, as he liked to be called, was a lover of all types of music, but had a special place in his heart for the sounds of Doo Wop which reminded him of the streets where he grew up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Similarly, he loved classic cars and loved collecting them, always eager to show them off at a nearby car cruise.  He was especially proud of his 55' Chevy Bel Air Convertible, a car that he owned when he was young and was thrilled to be able to find again later in life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  His gravely voice and knowledge of music soon led to hosting duties at those car cruises and, soon after, work as a DJ.  He loved finding great music to bring to the scene and share with fans.                                                                                                                                                  He was even know to appear on local radio shows that rocked the oldies and loved being part of the broadcasts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 On top of that, he also loved collecting a wide variety of antiques. From kitchen shakers to Depression glass to restoring old Hoosier cabinets, he loved decorating his home and property with all of his amazing finds. He also enjoyed collecting and building model trains and had spent years building tiny replicas of nearby Honesdale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Rick Zirpoli was one-of-a kind who lived life to the fullest.  A dear friend too many and a true character, he will be sorely missed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 He was greeted with open arms by his father Anthony and mother Sonia.

The courts upheld the law's ban on sanctuary policies and its key feature: a requirement that police officers, while enforcing other laws, question the immigration status of people suspected of being in the country illegally. Other provisions of the landmark law - such as a requirement that immigrants carry registration papers - were barred by the courts.

If you're not on board with free clothes, stop reading now. But if you're a fan of the idea (and not a fancy fashion blogger who is always just being handed free shit), keep going. The secret to scoring free stuff is to work your existing wardrobe. Go through the stuff you thought was cute a few years ago but wouldn't be caught dead in now, and get ready to do some up-cycling. Need some inspo? We've got you, girl.

Following the UK’s exit from the European Union on January 31, the country has entered into an 11-month transition period in which the two parties will negotiate a free trade agreement. Although many critics doubt the viability of achieving this before December 31, others, including new Conservative MP for Truro and Falmouth, Cherilyn Mackrory, have backed Boris Johnson. She told Express.co.uk that she was “positive” a trade deal could be reached by the end of the year because the EU will “not play games anymore” in the Brexit process.

Fantasy Island reminds you of Jumanji. A group of strangers undergo a series of events quite fantastic to stay alive. It also has tones of the Agatha Christie classic, And Then There Were None. Also from Lost. We must also bear in mind that it is the official adaptation of a popular American series of the 70s that bears the same name. The series had a mysterious host who invited a certain number of guests. Each guest underwent a personal fantasy, which invariably took on a life of its own and gave a life lesson to both the participant and the spectators. The stories were extravagant, dark, twisted and were always true to the saying that you should be careful what you want.

"Nearly 100 years ago, Alice Paul, a Republican, introduced the Equal Rights Amendment," Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a speech on the House floor ahead of the vote. "But today, in this year that marks the centennial of the 19th Amendment, it is a shameful reality that the Equal Rights Amendment has not been enshrined in the Constitution.""The ERA will strengthen America. It is not just about women, it is about America," Pelosi said. She received a round of applause from the Democrats in the chamber after she spoke.Nevada became the first state to ratify the amendment after the 1982 deadline in 2017, followed by Illinois in 2018.Ratifying the ERA was a priority for the Virginia legislature after Democrats gained control of both state houses, and the amendment was approved in January.However, even with the repeal of the ratification deadline in the House, it's uncertain if the amendment will be added to the Constitution. It's unclear whether the repeal will be approved in the Senate and signed by President Trump, and even if it were, five states have rescinded their earlier ratification. Supporters argue that these ratifications are invalid, due to precedent and statutory language.Moreover, most Republicans argue that Congress does not have the authority to eliminate the long-expired deadline, and say that the process should begin all over again with ratification by two-thirds of Congress and then by 38 states. This argument received support from Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a longtime advocate of the amendment, who said she would "like to see a new beginning" at an event at Georgetown University law school on Monday."There's too much controversy about latecomers," Ginsburg said. "Plus, a number of states have withdrawn their ratification. So if you count a latecomer on the plus side, how can you disregard states that said 'we've changed our minds?'"

The bad news for The Four Collins is they have to admit they were lip-syncing, so it looks like it’s back to the four individual foster home for all of them. But just as things look the bleakest, Mr. Roarke shows up to tell them their parents who were “lost at sea” have just “washed ashore in a remote part of Mexico.” (I assume alive.) Again, is that part of the fantasy? This show is pretty twisted! Mr. Rourke swears it’s true and shows the Baios some sort of official-looking document (it can't be that hard to forge a document on Fantasy Island), but I still think there’s a good chance The Four Collins will get back to the mainland and find out the whole “washed ashore” part was just part of the fantasy and it was just another punishment for their contribution to the horrors of lip-syncing.
