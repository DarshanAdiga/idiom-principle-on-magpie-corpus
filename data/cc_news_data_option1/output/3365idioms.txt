The simple fact is that measurement affects performance, as it signals to the rank and file what the system values. Hence, what gets measured gets improved. What doesn’t get measured, doesn’t count. We all—citizens and police alike—need to understand that. Respect that. And then, together, choose new performance measures that reflect today’s needs and aspirations. With that, when police fail, the public will know it is of the police officers’ own doing and not because of a corruptible performance measurement system. And when the police succeed, the entire community can feel a part of it.

Just think of the destruction wrought to Uganda by Idi Amin when he victimized the 300 000 Indians who were the anchor of that country’s economy in the 1970s. After expelling them in one big swoop, he transferred their assets to his tribesmen. But the tribesmen’s only expertise at the time was to mould dagga pots and tea-cups. As they say, the rest is history. Uganda is yet to recover from Amin’s wretchedness.

Counts 2, 3 and 5 were dismissed. Krista Blaisdell, special prosecutor for the Dickinson County Attorney’s Office, said there was insufficient evidence for the DUI charge.
 Asked by District Judge Benjamin Sexton how he was guilty of the first count, Mohn said he was driving too fast on a gravel road.
 “I had an accident and she got hurt,” Mohn said in the court hearing held with Zoom. “I can see where that is coming from. I can see how that will make me guilty.”
 The crash happened on 2100 Avenue south of the Abilene Municipal Airport.
 “I didn’t know I was going as fast as I was,” Mohn said. “I was going pretty fast and I went around the corner and hit the gravel and slid all over the place.”
 He testified that he was probably going over 45 miles per hour but not over 50.
 Mohn said he was not sure how bad the passenger was injured. Mohn was also transported by aircraft to a Wichita hospital.
 Blaisdell said the victim was treated in the hospital for several days. She sustained spinal injuries which caused temporary paralysis of her lower extremities.
 “The jury could have found that would have equated to great bodily harm,” Blaisdell said.
 Asked what he did to be guilty of count 4, Mohn first said he couldn’t remember.
 “I do not know,” he said. “I woke up in the hospital.”
 He said he read the reports where people say he offered them money.
 “I don’t know about that,” he said.
