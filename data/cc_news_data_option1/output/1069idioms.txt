But with more than half of the total delegates still up for grabs, and a rapidly evolving global pandemic that's upending all facets of life in the United States, the race to 1,991 pledged delegates -- the number needed to win the nomination -- may not be as settled as political pundits once thought.

Dopo un incarico a Gerusalemme portato a termine con grande successo, Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) decide di riposare un po’ concedendosi una breve vacanza. Quale migliore occasione che chiedere al suo amico e ammiratore Bouc (Tom Bateman), direttore dell’Oriente Express, di prenotargli un posto sul famosissimo treno? Durante il viaggio viene commesso un omicidio. Lo stesso Bouc prega Poirot di risolvere il caso prima che intervenga la polizia locale e possa incolpare uno qualunque dei passeggeri, magari mosso da pregiudizi razziali. Subito dopo l’assassinio, il treno rimane bloccato in un altissimo ponte in legno sospeso in una scarpata impressionate. Il nostro detective avrà tutto il tempo per trovare l’assassino, prima che arrivino i soccorsi per liberare il treno dalla neve. L’indagine è incalzante, avvincente, intrigante, perspicace, come in tutte le storie di Agatha Christie. Ma questa è un’altra storia da vedere nelle sale cinematografiche perché il finale, come in tutti i romanzi gialli, è sorprendente, anche per il lettore che avrà già letto il romanzo originale, anche per lo spettatore che avrà visto una precedente produzione cinematografica.

With two little kids and two sets of grandparents visiting us often, my husband and I knew we needed to bite the bullet and buy a bigger car. While our car buying experience had its ups and downs, I was pleasantly surprised at improvements car companies made to elevate our experience. One dealership, for example, helped entertain the kids so we could focus on making the right decision. With a play area, arts and crafts, and going so far as to give my kids stuffed animals, they really went above and beyond.

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 17th March, 2020) The first-ever European climate law will be used to "fill the void" in terms of discussions since it fails to address the 2030 emission goals and sets a low target on reducing emissions, Marc-Olivier Herman, a climate policy expert at international group Oxfam, a confederation of 19 charitable groups focusing on the alleviation of global poverty, told Sputnik.
 In March, the European Commission unveiled a major part of the so-called European Green Deal, the project of the first-ever climate legislation, aimed to create a legal infrastructure for putting the policies of the European Union member-states in line with climate neutrality goals. In order to establish a 2050 goal, the commission proposes regularly increasing emissions reduction over the next 30 years, without setting a goal for the first decade. This point faced fierce criticism of the major climate NGOs, which argue that not setting clear goals for 2030 means the EU is postponing the difficult decisions and fails to set an example to other countries in a fight against climate change.
 "The main fear is that the legislation, even if it is valuable and serves the progress, it can be used to fill the void in terms of discussions around 2030, something to show that we are doing something, distracting the attention from a really urgent question of the 2030 goals," Herman said, adding that EU could not solve the climate change on its own, but the block could do its fair share and set a "good example."
 The expert added that having a 2050 goal was valuable, but solutions in the short-term were also necessary, especially ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 in UK's Glasgow.
 "The main concern is that all the attention is currently focused on the 2050 goals, and the really hard decisions that need to be taken are left for later - for too late, that is the whole issue. A key question now is what we look at as 2030 goal, when it will be adopted and how ambitious it would be. This piece of legislation doesn't really answer that question, and that's a really important question.," Herman said.
 The European Commission vowed to present a "responsible" plan by September on how to raise its current 2030 target of reducing greenhouse gases by 40 percent from 1990 levels to at least 50 percent and more.

Business owners, especially those new to their position, may struggle with the concept of delegation. It's hard to imagine running your website from behind the scenes while a well-trained staff takes care of day-to-day operations. Let's be honest—without delegation, it's almost possible to grow your business because you can't handle everything yourself. I like to make a list of all of the things we do on a quarterly basis and assign my employees responsibilities based on their strengths and weaknesses. This tactic helps me make the most of my time and streamlines the process of managing my website. - Chris Christoff, MonsterInsights

As you look through the long and tedious list of things on your to-do list, consider whether the time it will take to complete them is worth it. If it isn’t, then look to outsource this to someone else. At the end of the day, time is your most valuable commodity and if you spend it doing things that don’t increase value, it’s better to hand them off. Sometimes, you do have to hustle through things, but be conscious of how long it takes you and what that time could have been spent doing. If you are determined to drive across town to get $1 cheaper gas, consider whether that 20-minute drive was worth the few bucks. Begin to view time as currency and you will quickly learn how to prioritize. - Jared Weitz, United Capital Source Inc.

If you review your holdings, be they individual securities or funds, you should be able to determine the level of “credit risk” in your portfolio. Specifically, if you own high-yield corporate bonds, high-yield muni bonds or preferred stocks, that’s a good indication that a hidden risk is about to identify itself. In fact, last week, that process started. A good example is companies in the oil sector, particular smaller ones that drill for oil. They flew higher during the U.S. shale oil boom. But they are highly-leveraged business. Now, the price of oil is down, companies owe money for the oil they already drilled or are in the process of drilling, and they are unlikely to be able to make ends meet. The debt markets have floated them the cash all this time, but the buck may literally stop here. That is one of many industries whose bonds just went from risky to severely damaged. This is one of the after-effects of the stock market bubble bursting, and the economy cratering as it is in the process of doing.
