The 66-year-old faces a daunting challenge to preserve his managerial record of never being relegated from the Premier League after West Brom slumped to a 3-0 defeat to Aston Villa in his first game on Sunday.
 The former England manager’s first match in charge since replacing Slaven Bilic left him with much food for thought—not least whether Jake Livermore should be restored to the captaincy when the former England international has served a three-game ban for his red card in Sunday’s match. Since the Premier League came into being, no club with fewer than eight points after 14 games have stayed up. This was West Brom’s 14th game and they have seven points.
 “An easy one next (Liverpool),” quipped Allardyce about next Sunday’s game at Anfield.“We will give it our best shot, no-one expected us to battle against Manchester City and I did not see that tonight, we need to find that.”
 Allardyce is renowned for no-frills football but his strength is instilling self-belief.He will need to act fast as Liverpool hammered Crystal Palace 7-0 at the weekend.
 “It’s one win in 14,” Allardyce said of West Brom. “My first battle is to make sure they don’t lose confidence in their own ability. “Then I need to guide them to battle their way out of this position, because they can’t play their way out.”
 Allardyce said he would consult with the players over their failure to adapt to the Premier League after Bilic guided them back a season after being relegated.“I want to find out why the players think they haven’t got the results they feel they have deserved,” he said.The Villa game was the seventh time they have failed to score—and they have kept only two clean sheets.“Small moments can define your season. If you concentrate when these small moments come along and you stop mistakes, then you stop conceding goals,” said Allardyce.

Releasing a science fiction film about a viral pandemic as audiences find themselves in the midst of a Covid-19 outbreak feels like a risky endeavour.
 On the one hand, an opportunity for escapism is a welcome distraction. On the other, the subject matter could see the film hitting a little too close to home for some.
 Directed by Liam O’Donnell, it’s precisely the situation new sci-fi offering Skylin3s finds itself in.The third film as part of the Skyline franchise, the timing of Skylin3s’ release comes a decade on from the initial instalment, which captured the imaginations of audiences worldwide.
 “That was just a really strange coincidence,” notes actress Lindsey Morgan, 30, of the timing of the release.“I spoke to someone the other day and they said ‘there really is not a better time than right now for this movie to come out’ and I was like ‘I don’t know if that’s a good thing?!’.
 “It was super strange but that’s kind of the cool thing that sci-fi lets us do.“Sci-fi can show us this fantastic mirror of what the future could be like or how different societies can govern themselves and what we’re capable of as a human species.”
 Continuing the tale of Captain Rose Corley, played by Morgan, best known for her role as Raven Reyes in The 100, the story takes place at a time when alien hybrids live side-by-side with humans on earth following an invasion.
 Having subsequently ensured that the aliens’ biological makeup has been altered in order for both species to co-exist peacefully, the virus causes the aliens revert back to their previous human hunting form.
 “I think sometimes we can watch superhero movies and think, ‘of course they’re going to win; of course Superman is going to defeat them!’”, says Morgan.“But with Rose, it really is a gamble; we just don’t know.
 “She has all this responsibility and pressure thrown on her and at the end of the day she really is 17 – people forget that.”The story sees Rose, who is herself a super-powered hybrid, lead a team of elite soldiers to an alien planet named Cobalt1 in order to save what’s left of humanity.
 A mission fraught with danger, O’Donnell’s vision of Rose as a strong, female character that takes centre stage is but one of the reasons Morgan was initially drawn to the project.“I love that we’re seeing more women in these very heroic positions but I also love that it’s not a masculine take on a woman being in a position of power,” says Morgan.
 “The big thing about Rose, for me, is that she’s still a girl.“She’s going to be a bit more emotional – and in my opinion, more complex, and having vulnerability, and wearing her heart on her sleeve.
 “She has this rapid-ageing syndrome thing happening and so she’s a lot younger than she actually appears, and so it was interesting that we had this flawed superhero.“I have this strong, super-human character that can do these amazing things but is also sensitive and complex that, in my opinion, you don’t always feel in male-centric superhero movies.”
 However, the film also shows a darker, more insecure side to Morgan’s character, as Rose finds herself battling her emotions following past trauma.“She has a guilt and shame she carries for a good half of the movie and it takes her a while to reconcile with herself,” reflects Morgan.
 “When she does, her true power is unleashed. And then she’s unstoppable.“I always think that’s a really nice message; we all have these unique gifts as people, we’re all different, and even though we may feel lost and outsiders at times, when we take our power back, that’s when our true selves and our greatest power comes from.”
 As you’d expect from any self-respecting sci-fi offering, Skylin3s is filled with perilous moments and CGI effects aplenty.
 From blazon-eyed aliens to interactive 3D holograms, the earth depicted on film is every-inch an evolution of our current surroundings.“It’s a little challenging and intimidating,” notes Morgan of a shoot involving so many heavily computer-generated environments.
 “It’s kind of like ‘here’s an empty space, make magic’ or ‘act with this green piece of tape’ or ‘imagine this giant alien but really it’s just a guy in green tights’.“But it also just brings you back to the basics,” she continues.
 “I got into this job because I love to use my imagination and I love to play and this is my opportunity to channel that child again and really just make everything up in my mind.”As the storyline progresses, all is not what it seems, as we see Morgan’s superior, General Radford, played by Alexander Siddig, drop a dark and unexpected bombshell.
 According to Morgan, it’s an important lesson when it comes to hierarchy – a takeaway the actress hopes audiences will ponder as a result of this dark, intergalactic adventure.
 “I hope people see it and question what these very big authoritative bodies of people and governments are telling us to do,” says Morgan.
 “And I think we, as people, need to take it upon ourselves to know more instead of just following blindly – we see how that gets us in trouble in the movie.“I think a healthy dose of scepticism is important.”Skylin3s will be released in select UK cinemas and available digitally on demand from December 18, 2020.

Namely that Spurs are perhaps not good enough to go all the way in the title race. Or perhaps more to the point, not with the style of football Mourinho currently employs.
 Mourinho remains an excellent manager, that much is clear.
 And he has done an admirable job at Tottenham so far.
 But the defensive tactics he now employs aren't likely to turn a side into title winners.
 His Chelsea sides, while watertight at the back, were still more than capable in front of goal.

Welcome to the improv that is the New Mexico School for the Arts.
 Improvisation has been the name of the game since the state charter high school opened in a former Catholic elementary school in 2010. The school moved into the former Sanbusco Market Center in 2019.
 In the first year at Sanbusco, the paseo of the former shopping center served as the dining area. So far, there hasn’t been a second year for students on campus.
 While students are learning from home, Klinger Constructors of Albuquerque is building a cafeteria at the school. Work is ahead of schedule because no students or teachers have been around since construction started in March, Head of School Eric Crites said.
 “One of the things I’m most excited about is the cafeteria is intentionally designed to be the heart of the school,” Crites said. “It creates an additional space for our artists to come together to work on senior projects. We are going to apply the same philosophy as we did to the classrooms that everything is moveable.”
 The cafeteria will also be the public event space and serve as a study hall.
 “We will have a gathering space where the entire school can meet,” school President Cindy Montoya said. “We will have a proper eating area.”
 The cafeteria will have a movable stage to create a performance space, Crites said.
 The school substantially remodeled Sanbusco’s three buildings, one dating to 1880. The cafeteria is the first new structure. A dormitory for 60 students and a theater are slated for the future, Crites said.
 The $3.8 million, 7,486-square-foot cafeteria will have a 4,956-square-foot assembly space with capacity for
 330 students. The school now has
 286 students.
 The 1,365-square-foot kitchen will remain empty because of budget constraints but will become a full kitchen to prepare meals for dorm students once the dormitory is built. Crites said the school will ask the Legislature in 2021 for $1.465 million to finish the cafeteria, including building out the kitchen.
 The school received $4.2 million in capital funding in 2019 from the Legislature to cover the design of the cafeteria, the initial design of the dormitory, demolition costs and construction of the cafeteria minus the kitchen, fencing on the courtyard outside the cafeteria and other finishing items, Crites said.
 A dormitory eventually will be built across the courtyard from the cafeteria. Students living in Albuquerque ride the New Mexico Rail Runner Express commuter train, and those in Los Alamos, Española, the Pojoaque Valley and Abiquiú take the Park and Ride bus. Students from farther away would live in the dorms.
 Dorm students lived at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Retreat and Conference Center until in-school teaching ended March 12 and the residential program was suspended.
 The school acquired Sanbusco Market Center in 2015 and started renovations in March 2018. The work involved extensive demolition, shoring up the foundation and converting retail space into classrooms, rehearsal halls and practice rooms, Montoya said.
 Construction was completed in July 2019 and school started in August 2019.
 “We literally moved an entire school in a week,” Montoya said.
 The cafeteria should be finished in May.
 “As an arts school, we have a lot of experience of using every square foot we have for multiple purposes,” Crites said. “When you have a community full of creative thinkers, you see a lot of ingenuity happening. The fact we were able to repurpose a structure that has had so many uses over the years into a space that allows us to operate a full academic curriculum and full arts curriculum is remarkable.”
