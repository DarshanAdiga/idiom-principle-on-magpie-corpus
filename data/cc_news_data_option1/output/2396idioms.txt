A Central government committee appointed under the Ministry of Home Affairs has recommended that treatment charges for Covid-19 in private hospitals must be slashed by more than half in New Delhi. The recommendations arrive as India registers a record high of 13,000 new infections of the virus in one single day with Delhi recording 2,877 cases.
 The expert committee chaired by VK Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog has recommended that, including the personal protective equipment donned by health workers, charges should be capped at ₹8,000-10,000 for an isolation bed from ₹24,000-25,000 charged by private hospitals excluding PPE.
 Charges for ICU bed without ventilator is capped at ₹13,000-15,000 as compared with current prices of ₹34,000 to ₹43,000.
 For ICU facility with ventilator facility the charge is set at ₹15,000-18,000 against the average price calculated by the committee which stood at ₹44,000-54,000 now.
 An analysis of rate charts suggests that in a private hospital, bills for a single day admission with a ventilator can cost close to ₹1 lakh per day. For instance, Max Hospital charges over ₹70,000 for a ventilator bed in an ICU, while the Fortis group has said it charges over ₹20,000 for ICU bed with separate doctor charges, routine tests as well as overheads such as bedside procedures of central line insertion, nebulisation, ventilator charges for six hours at close to ₹2,000 and with some individual procedures charged up to ₹9,000.
 Experts say that there needs to be clarity on what is excluded or included while capping the charges apart from specific mention of PPE and ventilators. “We do not know if rates subsume costs of managing co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension, kidney, heart issues and so on as well as high-end medicines and lab investigations. The committee report should be made available to analyse this. Also, if Covid-19 patients are experiencing lengthy stays with need for oxygen and ventilator support. Even at these rates costs will not be affordable,” said Malini Aisola, co-convenor, All India Drug Action Network.
 “The lower rates are suggested by the panel but they have not been finalised. The capping is much lower than what Association of Healthcare Providers and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry had suggested to the centre,” said HS Chabra, medical director, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre in Delhi.
 On June 19, Delhi government said that it will cap the prices of Covid-19 at ₹2,400 following the central committee recommendations, and Supreme Court has stated that all States should follow suit and cap test prices as in Delhi, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU/Gray News) - The famed “Bus 142” on the Stampede Trail has been removed by the state of Alaska, according to the mayor of the Denali Borough.Mayor Clay Walker said Thursday a coordinated effort between the State Departments of Natural Resources, Military and Veterans Affairs, and Transportation came up with the plan to remove the bus, a longtime attraction for travelers and hikers.The bus was made famous by the book and movie “Into the Wild” and turned into a pilgrimage site for travelers recreating the steps of Chris McCandless, who journeyed into the wilderness of Alaska in 1992 intending to live off the land. McCandless died, malnourished, in the old Fairbanks transit bus that had often been used as shelter by hunters in the wilderness west of the Teklanika River.However, that pilgrimage didn't come easy, as a number of rescues have been made on the river either for people who crossed the river and couldn't make it back, or for parties that went down the river.Last summer, a newlywed couple from Belarus found trouble in the river, and 24-year-old Veramika Maikamava was swept into the river and died.The Department of Natural Resources says at least one other person has drowned on their way to or from the bus since 2010.Walker says the removal of the bus is in the best interest of public safety - for the public and first responders.“We do believe that the removal of the bus will lessen the attraction,” Walker said. “Some people will still make that pilgrimage to that spot, but fewer people with that bus removed.”In March, after a rescue effort for five people in the area, Walker says the Borough Assembly was given a proposal to build a footbridge over the river, which it declined. At the same time, he said, the Assembly asked the state to remove the derelict bus."That river is a perilous river, and three people have died on the west side of it or in the river, and we believe the right thing to do for public safety is to remove that perilous attraction," Walker said.The Alaska Army National Guard airlifted the bus with a Chinook Helicopter, as a training exercise and no additional cost to the state, said Corri Feige, Alaska's Commissioner of Natural Resources, in a release.It was then loaded on a flatbed truck for transport.Walker said he didn't know the plan for the bus, which is now in the State of Alaska's possession.“They are putting it in safe storage currently and working on the plan,” he said.KTUU’s Mike Ross contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 KTUU via Gray Media Group, Inc.

Construction of the 2.2-mile section of the Erie Canalway/Empire State Trail from the village of Mohawk to the Ilion Marina is scheduled to begin in late July, said Shane Mahar, a spokesman for the Canal Corporation.
   
 Mahar said bids were received for the project last week and a contract will be awarded soon. Completion is scheduled by the end of this year.
   
 Plans for the estimated $2 million project call for the new section of trail to start where the trail in German Flatts ends near MOVAC headquarters at the intersection of Routes 28 and 5S. It will continue under the bridge that crosses the Erie Canal and the Mohawk River, running parallel to Route 5S.
   
 Culverts for the smaller streams will be extended, but the work will also include construction of a bridge over Fulmer Creek. The section will eventually end at the Ilion Marina.
   
 The paved trail will be 10 feet wide with a 2-foot shoulder on both sides and 5 feet of cleared area along it.
   
 Work is also underway on three other sections of the trail located in the Herkimer-Oneida County area:
   
 • A 2.2-mile section from Lock E-18 in Jacksonburg in the town of German Flatts to Route 167 in Little Falls
   
 • A 2.3-mile section of trail from the town of Frankfort to the marina in Ilion
   
 • A 3.5-mile section from Utica to Dyke Road in the town of Schuyler
   
 The projects will fill gaps in the Canalway Trail and are scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Work was delayed for a time when the state ordered a halt to all non-essential businesses and construction projects in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 Groundbreaking for the trail between the Jacksonburg lock and Route 167 took place last September, on the same day the section of trail from Fort Herkimer Church to the lock was dedicated.
   
 The Erie Canalway Trail is part of a 750-mile Empire State Trail running from Albany to Buffalo on the 360-mile Canalway Trail and from New York City to the Canadian border through the Hudson Valley and Adirondacks, while also connecting to existing hiking and bike trails.

Abbiamo avuto l’occasione di conoscerci e soprattutto di scambiarci idee per il futuro del polo siderurgico e della città - il commento di Latini -. I Marcegaglia mi sono sembrati molto determinati nel loro progetto per Ast. Da parte mia ho ribadito che a Terni servono lavoro, sviluppo e investimenti e che approcciarsi con la nostra città per un possibile acquirente di Ast significa entrare in contatto con una comunità che ha fortemente radicato nel suo Dna il valore della cultura industriale. Quest’aspetto è fondamentale perché significa che 150 anni di industrializzazione hanno creato a Terni professionalità e capacità specifiche, ma anche un sistema di relazioni industriali molto più complesso che altrove e una grande sensibilità alle tematiche ambientali, sviluppatasi soprattutto negli ultimi anni. Su questi temi - aggiunge il sindaco -, come rappresentanti dei cittadini, manterremo sempre alta l'attenzione, con l'obiettivo di conciliare sviluppo, tutela del territorio e salvaguardia dell'ambiente». Riguardo ai contenuti della possibile offerta di Marcegaglia, il sindaco pone i suoi paletti: mantenimento e potenziamento dell’area a caldo e del sito integrato nonché dei livelli occupazionali, rimanendo quindi a favore di qualsiasi iniziativa che vada nella direzione dello sviluppo economico della città. «E’ comprensibile che il vissuto degli ultimi 25 anni ci porti a essere diffidenti, visto che l’Ast ha subito un progressivo ridimensionamento, perdendo settori di produzione e quote di mercato, con conseguenti tagli occupazionali. Fondamentale è dunque che la città e i lavoratori di Ast percepiscano nel progetto una discontinuità in positivo che dovrà prevedere la centralità di Terni nel piano industriale del gruppo». «Se così sarà - conclude il sindaco - la città saprà rispondere e anche le istituzioni saranno pronte ad instaurare relazioni positive nell’interesse del territorio».

I grew up under Ian Smith Rhodesia regime, at a time when Blacks were not allowed to walk along pavements as they were reserved for whites alone. blacks had to walk off pavements along the roads amongst traffic including vehicles and bicycles. it is right that Britain has finally woken up to the discrimination, inequality and institutional racism in the country because of the racist police murder of George Floyd in USA and the growing 'BLACK LIVES MATTER! movement and protests globally. This is a time for all to stand up in absolute defiance to oppression of Blacks, which many of us have silently lived through in the First world, painfully seeing the vile conduct displayed and masked with plastic smiles. Many of us who can stand up for themselves, know a lot, have facts and evidence regarding racism in the first world, and the time will come when we can help the system eradicate this hostility and bring equality of all races, when the law takes its knee off our necks and we can breathe and not accept being silenced legally over institutional racism,…watch this space!

I may be the only one who welcomed the reassessment of our home. I welcomed it because I knew what it meant to our city budget, our employees and the services we are able to provide you. For nearly all of the 14 years that I have served you we have had to rob Peter to pay Paul among the different departments within the city. I know and understand that many feel they are over taxed and underserved; but when I reflect on what we can do without as a community it gets really hard to make much of a list that would return significant dollars back to you as tax payers. I empathize with the argument that folks on a fixed income make. As a teacher in Idaho my family has always lived on a fixed income, one paycheck to the next. Early on hard choices were made between things our kids needed and bills that were past due. I get it; it is really hard, desperately hard, when ends don’t meet. As a community I think we do a very good job in helping and accommodating those truly in need while providing essential services to everyone along with open green spaces to enjoy and relax.

In that 2013 ruling, justices wrote McMaster hadn’t followed Brown’s expressed wishes for most of his money to go to charity, having instead selected a professional manager who took control of Brown’s assets from the estate’s trustees to settle Brown's debts. Writing that McMaster's deal “destroys the estate plan Brown had established in favor of an arrangement overseen virtually exclusively by the AG,” the court also ruled then that the Godfather of Soul was of sound mind when he made his will before his death.

“The hard-working farming community invests in many agricultural products and services that help them produce wholesome foods, feed, and quality fibers for consumers in the United States and across the globe. Like most conventional farmers, soybean and cotton producers purchased such a product legally when they bought the dicamba herbicide for this growing season. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently vacated the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) federal registration for three dicamba herbicide products on the market registered for over the top applications. The effect of this ruling during growing season may prevent cotton and soybean farmers from using these products in combating weeds that threaten the quantity and quality of the crop.

For now, following Thursday’s decision, these Dreamers expect things will continue as they have, renewing their DACA status every two years and facing the same obstacles they have in the past, such as facing the lack of in-state tuition rates.

Bollywood actor Arjun Kapoor is known for his sense of humour and he loves to interact with his friends and fans on social media. When Malaika Arora took to Instagram and shared a series of pictures of herself while sitting by the pool and playing with her hair, Kapoor dropped a hilarious comment which stole the show. Malaika Arora captioned the image by writing, "#tuesdayteachings .... 5 steps on how u can learn to tie a ponytail.....#tossntie (swipe right )". While the caption suggests teaching how to tie the knot, her hair was still open in the fifth snap. So, Arjun Kapoor noticed that and pulled the former's leg with a witty comment. He wrote, "Still not tied after five pictures...". Malaika Arora also quickly responded to him and replied, "achaa".

Uttarakhand High Court on Friday directed the state government to sanitise schools across the state before the commencement of the board examinations in the state from June 22. HC stressed that sanitisation would not mean mere sanitisation of the rooms but the sanitisation of desks, chairs, toilets and the entire school premises and examination centresThe HC gave these directions while responding to an urgency application filed by advocate Shiv Bhatt in an ongoing PIL related to the condition of the quarantine centres in the state and how the state was fighting COVID-19 epidemic.Last week, the Uttarakhand government had released the date-sheet for the remaining board exams to be held from June 22-25. The board examination dates were changed from June 20-23 to June 22-25 as the state government has decided to keep everything shut on weekends in Dehradun and one of the earlier dates was falling on a weekend."The concern raised here is that the Board examination of Class 10 and Class 12 which were being conducted by the Uttarakhand School Education Board had to be abruptly stopped due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These exams have been rescheduled and are to commence very soon (from June 22).. The concern raised is that many of these examination centres, particularly in village and tehsil level, are in such school premises which are either running as quarantine centres or were running as quarantine centres, and therefore, the students at these centres are at great risk of being infected from the coronavirus", the court order said.The HC said that advocate general has informed it that "no examination is being held in any educational institutions which are presently being run as an Institutional quarantine centre. Some of the education Institutions were indeed running as quarantine centres earlier but all of these were vacated and cleared by June 15, and they have been sanitised".HC in its order said, "For further precautionary measures, however, we direct the authority concerned to sanitise these centres today as well a day prior to the examination. The sanitisation would not mean mere sanitisation of the room but the sanitisation of desks, chairs, toilets and the entire premises. This shall apply to all the examination centres".On Wednesday, the state education department had released a fresh set of guidelines. Students will be thermally scanned before entering the examination centres and those students whose temperatures are found to be higher than normal, arrangements will be made for them to write the exam in a separate room on the same day. Also, examination centres will not be set up in any of the containment zones in the state and those students who are living in containment zones on the day of the exam, will be able to write the examination on a separate day.
