 SEJONG, Aug. 16 (Yonhap) -- The government's restrictions on classroom capacity will be strengthened in the metropolitan area starting next week following a surge in the number of new coronavirus cases in the region, the education ministry said Sunday.\n From Tuesday to Sept. 11, the number of students at kindergartens and elementary and middle schools should be kept under one-third of the total for schools in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province, heightened from an earlier guideline that limited them to a two- thirds level, according to the Ministry of Education.\n The decision came as South Korea has seen a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases related to churches in the greater Seoul area, prompting the government to raise the social distancing guidelines in the region by one notch to Level 2 in the three-tier system for two weeks starting Sunday.\n For schools in regions other than the metropolitan area, the government strongly advised keeping the number of students at a two-t

Health authorities reported 13 new cases of the coronavirus in New Zealand on Sunday, including 12 linked to an outbreak in the city of Auckland and one returning traveler who was already in quarantine. The outbreak in Auckland, discovered Tuesday, has prompted officials to put the nation's largest city back into a two-week lockdown. The outbreak has now grown to 49 infections, with authorities saying they believe all the cases are all connected, giving them hope the virus isn't spreading beyond that cluster. New Zealand had gone 102 days without community spread of the disease before the latest outbreak. Officials believe the virus was reintroduced to New Zealand from abroad but haven't yet been able to figure out how it happened.

 “On form, KL will be my frst choice and after that you can look at Rishabh and give him chances,” Mongia, one of India’s finest wicket-keepers, told _PTI_ on Sunday.
 While Dasgupta agreed with Mongia, he feels the team could be “format flexible” on using Rahul and Pant.
 “Look, in T20s, I believe both can play in the XI. But given a choice, KL will be my Man for the time at least in T20s.
 “However in 50 over format, may be team management and selectors can speak to him and see he wants to do it long term till 2023 World Cup and bat at No 5 which is a critical slot in the middle-order,” Dasgupta, who has extensively covered Indian cricket in past few years as a broadcaster, said.
 For Prasad, who recently was head of the selection committee, also agrees that KL will have a slight edge but Rishabh will be there in the mix.
 “If you go by New Zealand series, the last one we played, KL starts as first choice and Sanju is also there but as third choice. He did well and gives that flexibility to play extra batsman or bowler as per conditions.
 “But yes, after five months, everyone starts from scratch and IPL form will be important,” said Prasad.
 So where does it leave Pant? Prasad and Dasgupta feel that Dhoni’s retirement should make Pant breathe easier.
 “Don’t forget that the constant comparisons with Dhoni would have weighed a lot on his young mind. It doesn’t help in getting performances with that pressure. So now, he is free and can express himself in the best possible manner. But yes, he also needs to mature a bit as a player,” Dasgupta asserted.
 For Prasad, Pant can now be “Rishabh rather than being Mahi Junior”.
 “Indian cricket has invested in Rishabh Pant over the last few years. We have seen best and worst of Pant in these years. He is someone who will serve Indian cricket for a long time provided he is groomed properly.
 “This IPL will also prove where each one stands in terms of form and fitness. But I agree that Rishabh needs to be given a fair go before you think of anyone else,” Prasad said.
 Mongia, however, feels that there will be pressure and that’s a good a thing for young Pant.
 “It’s huge boots to fill in and rightly so. You don’t get MS Dhoni’s everyday. So Pant will get his opportunity and let him prove his mettle. I am sure that the team management will give him enough chances.
 “He has potential and now what he will do with the chances is up to him,” Mongia said.

Rod was born in Ellendale, ND on May 2, 1963 to Melvin and Vangie Fregien. He grew up on the family farm East of Ashley, ND and graduated from Ashley High School in 1981. He also graduated from North Dakota State College of Science in 1983 with a degree in Auto Body. In 1985, he moved to Bozeman, MT with his parents. Rod put his heart and soul in everything he did. His longest career in Bozeman was working as a hod carrier for Marks and Hanson Masonry for 22 years. In his own words, he would say "I built half of Bozeman!". He retired soon thereafter. Rod enjoyed fishing and hunting and was oftentimes up in the mountains deep in snow waiting for the perfect shot. He wore his heart on his sleeve, was a gentle soul, and always let his family know he loved them. His furry, 4-legged pets - Suny, Rusty, Spencer, and Ginger - also had a special place in his heart.

FRAMINGHAM -- The day after Eurie Stamps Sr. was killed by a Framingham police officer, in January 2011, Dion Young went to CVS and bought a florescent green poster board. He wrote, "Justice for Eurie Stamps" on it, and staked it in his front yard for about a week.
 More than nine years later, Young joined hundreds of Stamps' family, friends and other activists on Saturday afternoon to seek justice for "Big Eur."
 "My only question is -- why did it take so long?" asked Young, addressing a crowd of about 100 during a vigil for Stamps in front of the downtown Memorial Building -- and directly in front of the Framingham Police Station. "We should've been here in 2011."
 After holding a march for Stamps in Cambridge earlier this month, a group called #JusticeForEurie held a vigil for him in Framingham, where he lived after retiring from the MBTA.
    Eurie Stamps supporters push for national recognition in police shooting victim's home city of Cambridge  
 Stamps, 68, was sitting in his pajamas watching a Celtics basketball game when a Framingham SWAT team burst through his front door in the middle of the night. After complying with police orders to get down on the floor, he was fatally shot by Officer Paul Duncan, who said he had tripped.
    Framingham man shot and killed during SWAT raid  
 The person the SWAT Team was searching for -- Stamps' stepson -- was already standing outside, said Stamps' friend, Larry Stead, a former Cambridge police officer of 35 years. He said police rolled up to Stamps' household in tow with two fire engines, prepared to burn his house down if they couldn't get through the front door.
 "That was no accident -- Eurie got murdered," said Stead.
 The #JusticeForEurieStamps group has three demands in seeking justice:
    Adequately honor and recognize Stamps   Have Stamps' case reopened by the U.S. Department of Justice and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey   Fire Duncan.  
 "Personally, I'd like to see the training room over here (at the) Framingham Police Headquarters named after Eurie Stamps," said former MetroWest Daily News reporter and editor Rick Holmes, who wrote about Stamps' case as the paper's opinion editor. "And put a big sign in there telling his story so everybody who puts on the uniform for the Framingham Police Department knows exactly what happened to Eurie Stamps."
 Holmes said that when the Middlesex district attorney decided to investigate and not prosecute the killing of Stamps, he didn't have an advocate for himself -- but Duncan did.
 "And they let (Duncan) off the hook, without even a serious investigation," Holmes said. "They never put witnesses under oath, they never had a forensic analysis of the trajectory of the bullet -- they just accepted at face value that Paul Duncan said it was an accident, so no big deal. Well it is a big deal, and it's not an accident, and he's not getting away with it."
 Holmes also called for several other measures to be taken, including defunding SWAT Teams nationally, demilitarizing the police, ending no-knock warrants, ending qualified immunity and ending the war on drugs.
 "His story was not told across the country by the national media, it was barely covered by the local media," said Framingham Democratic Committee Chairman Mike Hugo, who was a friend of Stamps. "Eurie Stamps was a mere blip on the news wires. Framingham dodged a bullet, and Eurie could not."
 When the lawsuit against police was filed 10 months after Stamps was killed, the city of Framingham "did nothing," Hugo said.
 "They didn't even bother to respond to the lawsuit until the United States district judge entered a default judgment and threatened to strip Framingham of its rights and announced he alone would decide how much Framingham should pay instead of wasting time going to a jury," he said.
    Framingham settles lawsuit in Stamps case   Family of Framingham man killed by police receives $3.75 million settlement  
 Since Stamps' death, several changes have been made in the Framingham Police Department, including the dismantling of its SWAT Team, said Mayor Yvonne Spicer, who knew the Stamps family for many years. Most recently, she signed the "8 Can't Wait" declaration with recently retired Framingham Police Chief Steven Trask, and since she took office, the city's first Black deputy chief was hired.
 While a street sign, basketball court and the city's basketball league will be named after Stamps in Cambridge, Spicer said she is working toward crafting a scholarship at Framingham Public Schools in his name.
 After Spicer's speech, the crowd erupted in a chant to "fire Paul Duncan."
 "I hear the passion, but there's a whole lot to unpack," she told the Daily News about the cries for Duncan's termination. She said activists, however, made "a good point" about his position on the police force.
 "We'll see where we go from there," she said about continuing her conversation with the Stamps family.
 U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III also stopped by to call for justice, and urged activists to continue spreading Stamps' name and story. Statements from U.S. Sen. Ed Markey; state Sen. Karen Spilka, D-Ashland; and state Rep. Jack Lewis, D-Framingham, were also read, calling for justice and advocating to make the necessary reforms to do so.
 "Mr. Stamps' murder serves as a reminder of our greatest fears -- that our loved ones of color may comply with all the demands made of them by police officers, no matter how humiliating or unnecessary as they may be, and may still lose their lives to a racist system that has already deemed their bodies as weapons," wrote Lewis.
 Other speakers Saturday included Mariah Wilkins, a granddaughter of Stamps; Brock Satter. of Mass Action Against Police Brutality; and Dr. Patricia Sanchez-Connally, a Framingham State University sociology professor. One of Stamps' grandsons, Aaron Wilkins, also performed three rap songs with his partner, 24 Keyz.
 Currently, there is a proposal before the City Council to establish a Civilian Police Review Board, as well as a soon-to-be finished resolution and letter asking the city to reopen the case and issue a formal apology, according to District 9 City Councilor Tracey Bryant.

Alice Ann Bandy was born October 2, 1930 in Ollie, Montana to Bertha and Norman Rost. Alice was the youngest of Bertha and Norman's six children. Alice attended school in Ollie through the 8th grade and then she completed the rest of her education in Baker, Montana. Alice's work included bank cashier, secretary, and dance teacher for Arthur Murray Dance Studio in Billings, Montana. It was during this time that Alice met the love of her life, Vern Bandy. After two years of courtship, they were married in 1958 in Miles City, MT. Alice and Vern then packed up their belongings and along with Alice's two daughters, Rena and Gayle from a previous marriage, they all moved to Bozeman, MT. As a family they spent their summers camping and water skiing, with Alice always in charge of driving the boat. Many holidays with extended family were spent at the Bandy house. Games, dancing and family entertainment were a must. Alice loved to cook and entertain and every occasion had a fabulous meal prepared by her. She also loved couples bridge club, sewing, reading cookbooks and dancing with Vern. They were magic on the dance floor. Alice was very involved in Campfire Girls and eventually was President of the Bozeman Chapter. She always encouraged her Campfire girls to get involved in community service. Alice had a great faith in God and was a very active participant in her church. Alice's ability to offer wise counsel did not go unnoticed. Alice was always there and spot on with her wisdom and input for whomever needed her advice. Whenever Alice stated, "Mark my Words" we knew she would be right! Alice was preceded in death by her parents, four of her siblings and her husband Vern. Alice is survived by her sister Rose Norman, daughters Rena (Bruce) McKay, Gayle Hickert, grandsons Mitch (Mary) McKay, Michael Hickert, Justin Hickert, and granddaughter Jaime (Matthew) Chapman. Great grandchildren Gabriel and Olivia Saunders, Zoe and Maeve McKay, Mattie and Henry Hickert and numerous nieces and nephews. Alice's great source of pride was her family. She loved them dearly. Visits from them and her great grandchildren would put huge smiles and looks of pure joy on her face. We will also miss her so much and will cherish the memories we made with her.

Now more than ever, students must participate in decision-making processes at Virginia Tech. While VT students are unable to elect university administration, there is supposedly a Student Government Association (SGA). On paper, SGA looks pretty good - it's elected by undergraduate students and participates in university governance. Unfortunately, the reality of SGA does not reflect these aspirations.
 As of writing this letter, visitors to SGA’s website will have a hard time reading SGA legislation, as no legislation from any year is available to view. While this may partially be an issue of abysmal transparency, many public meeting minutes show business sections as completely blank. Meeting minutes reflect a stunning lack of discussion and action in response to the coronavirus and racial injustice. The most fervent debate members had last year was on how to raise their number of allowable meeting absences.

In 29 states -- beginning in 1907 and until the laws were repealed in the 1940s -- those deemed socially inferior (an inexcusable euphemism for what was then defined as physically "inadequate") were, in fact, subject to compulsory sterilization. From asthma to scoliosis, mental disability to moral delinquency, eugenicists denounced difference in light of a presumed cultural superiority, a skewed imperialism that found its most nefarious expression during the Third Reich. To measure difference was to eradicate it, exterminate it, excise it from evolutionary fact. Though ultimately discredited following the atrocities endured during multiple years of Nazi reign, eugenic theory was steeped in this sinister view of genetic governance, manifest destiny run amok.

Thanks to all of you, we’re ready.
 There will be risk, at MSU and everywhere else, this fall. While the risk from the coronavirus will not be zero, MSU has taken precautions to minimize it, keeping the safety of our students, faculty and staff as our top concern.
 Therefore, in saying that we are ready, it means more than relying upon the plans already drafted. It means that we are also ready for the uncertainties that this new season will bring, ready to adapt, ready to respond, ready to care for each other, and ready to do the right thing, each and every time.
 I implore each of you to mind the public health advice you’ve heard so often. Wear face masks, wash your hands, know the symptoms and stay home if you’re sick. Now more than ever we must take individual responsibility for our collective good.
 I know — and I am proud — that the Bobcats of near and far are ready to meet this challenge together. Go ‘Cats!

The gorgeous, futuristic-looking $2,799 GoCycle GS is not your average folding e-bike. Its motor is located in the front and it has a fully enclosed chain that runs to the back wheel. This allows you to commute without worrying about getting grease on you or your clothes or lubing the chain after being out on a wet day. Roads with rough patches are less of a problem with its rear suspension, too.
 The wheels attach with single-sided mounts, which is a major design standout, allowing them to be quickly removed by hand. It also means you can break it down into smaller pieces to take up less space. The whole thing weighs 36.3 pounds (16.5 kg) and you can get a Portable Docking Station that's essentially a rolling suitcase for the bike for stowing and transport.
 The GS settings are controlled by an iOS or Android device via Bluetooth through the GoCycleConnect app. Two bands on the handlebar securely hold your phone while riding. While riding the GoCycle you're able to change assistance modes, speeds and toggle the throttle on and off.
 Throttle assistance can only be used when traveling at least 4 mph, so as not to put too much pressure on the 500-watt motor. The GoCycle's 300Wh battery gets about 40 miles (65 km) on a full charge depending on your riding style and weight; it'll support riders up to 220 pounds and pedal/throttle assist up to 20 mph. A full charge takes about seven hours or three and a half with a fast charger (sold separately).
 The GS focuses on the little details, such as its center stand that folds up discreetly under the bike making it almost invisible. I can not emphasize enough how beautifully designed this bike is. How they squeezed so much into this small bicycle is just amazing.
 At $2,799 you're getting a premium ride (and it's not even the company's top model), but if you're not sure it's worth it sight unseen, you may find a local retailer that carries the GoCycle line and allows test rides.

In addition to the changes made to our practices, we have built partnerships with health authorities and with the state of Montana. MSU faculty have helped our local Bozeman Health implement more rapid testing by providing key equipment and knowledge. The state of Montana reached out to us to process large numbers of samples from asymptomatic individuals, providing valuable surveillance testing to monitor the virus. The Montana University System will receive up to $20 million in federal CARES funding for essential COVID-19 initiatives, including the rapid testing of symptomatic students and hiring contact tracing staff at MSU. Importantly, we will continue to work closely with the Gallatin City-County Health Department who will alert us if there is a risk to our campus community.
 We have come far from where we were in March, when the pandemic hastened into our lives and swept away so much. MSU adapted quickly, moving to remote instruction and advising our students to stay away and keep themselves healthy. The rapidity of changes this spring was truly startling, and the semester’s end was not the one we hoped to see. Yet even with campus almost empty as May arrived, we innovated and found creative ways to virtually honor our departing graduates and provided them with a keepsake graduation in a box. Even amidst hard times, celebrating life’s milestones is vital to the human spirit.
 The five months since have perhaps been the busiest this campus has ever seen. The amount of work put into preparing for tomorrow has been staggering. I do not have words to express the depth of my gratitude to so many for making this possible: the dedicated staff members who continued the necessary work on campus during the governor’s stay-at-home order and beyond; our faculty who have adapted, innovated and worked so hard on the plans for fall classes; our students, who are the beating heart of the university; and our alumni and members of our community, who have supported MSU throughout.

As the pandemic raged this spring, the iLearn chain of charter schools in North Jersey received $1.4 million in stimulus funding to offset the outbreak’s blow to public education.
 The grant was part of a pot of money divvied among traditional school districts and charters like iLearn, which educates nearly 4,400 students at arts and sciences schools in Bergen, Passaic and Hudson counties. The funds were provided by the CARES Act, a $2 trillion package that aimed to rescue an economy suddenly addled by disease.
 But for charter schools, that wasn’t the only bailout that the massive federal law offered for coronavirus recovery.
 Unlike conventional public schools, charters were also in line for millions of dollars in small business aid under the Paycheck Protection Program, another piece of CARES. And get in line they did, with at least 39 charter schools in the Garden State quietly receiving hefty forgivable loans from PPP, a review by NJ Advance Media showed.
 In the iLearn network, Bergen Arts & Science Charter School and Passaic Arts & Science Charter School were each awarded $2 million to $5 million, according to the Small Business Administration, which broke the loans down only into broad ranges. Paterson Arts & Science and Hudson Arts & Science were granted $1 million to $2 million each, and a sister school in the Bronx was approved for $350,000 to $1 million.
 Ilearn’s central office, a Fair Lawn nonprofit that manages the charters, also applied for PPP money, and got $350,000 to $1 million.
 That aid has charter school critics bristling, as they note it was unavailable to school districts that face their own budgetary woes. Those advocates accuse charter schools of using their unique structure — they are publicly funded, but privately managed — to reap a windfall by qualifying for money on both the public and private sides of the ledger, while still collecting their standard per-pupil, taxpayer-funded revenue.
 “They’re double dipping, in effect,” said Julia Rubin, an associate professor at Rutgers University’s Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy. “They’re getting funds as nonprofits and they’re getting funds as public schools.”
 ILearn’s chief executive, Nihat Guvercin, defended the decision to seek PPP dollars, which were meant to reward businesses and nonprofits that kept their employees on the job. Guvercin and other charter school operators said the money did just that, allowing them to prepare for deep budget shortfalls that Gov. Phil Murphy has warned of in the coming months.
 “In the spring the PPP loan proceeds assisted us in avoiding layoffs from COVID-19,” Guvercin said in a statement. “Governor Murphy has projected ‘Armageddon’ school funding cuts this school year. Consistent with Governor Murphy’s advocacy to optimize federal support to New Jersey local governments during the pandemic, our schools applied for PPP loans.”
 In total, between $33.9 million and $55.1 million went to New Jersey charters through PPP, Small Business Administration data shows. On top of that, some chains like iLearn were granted money not only for their schools, but for the nonprofits that oversee them.
 Harry Lee, the president of the New Jersey Public Charter Schools Association, said the aid was a lifeline that came as New Jersey underfunds charter schools. His organization estimates they receive 73 cents on the dollar in per-pupil funding compared to their traditional counterparts, which he said left charters vulnerable to the outbreak’s impact.
 “Charter schools saved hundreds of jobs because they got access to this money,” Lee said. “We should applaud them for using federal assistance to save jobs.”
 Michael Piscal, the chief executive of the College Achieve chain of charter schools, called it “ridiculous” to criticize charters for taking PPP, when they lack the financial girth of school districts and do not have the power to raise taxes to plug budget gaps.
 College Achieve’s three charter school systems in Plainfield, Asbury Park and Paterson received a combined $1.7 million to $4 million in loans, and its Tinton Falls-based nonprofit got $150,000 to $350,000. Piscal said the schools employ more than 300 people, with the funds keeping their jobs intact despite cuts to state aid that may only get worse.
 “Every nonprofit in the country applied for this money and we’re a nonprofit,” Piscal said. “We were contemplating layoffs too, and this prevented us from doing that.”
 PPP was part of the stimulus package that Congress rushed into law in the early days of the pandemic as life ground to a halt and the shutdown caused businesses to hemorrhage money and jobs. The $660 billion program was meant to inject money into the economy and encourage a wide range of organizations to keep their workers off unemployment.
 Applicants were eligible for up to 2½ times their monthly payroll costs, provided they certified that “current economic uncertainty” made the loan necessary. The program offered a big incentive: If the funds were spent on salaries and other business expenses such as rent and utilities, the debt will be forgiven — turning it into a grant.
 Charter schools have long been a lightning rod, with critics charging they siphon money from traditional school districts and supporters saying they give families needed choice, particularly in struggling urban communities with failing school systems. Across New Jersey, they are a small but influential part of the education landscape, with 59,000 of the state’s 1.3 million public school students enrolled in charter schools.
 Not every charter school sought PPP money. Statewide, there are 87 charters and three renaissance school systems, a hybrid in charter-rich Camden that is also publicly funded but privately run.
 Reporters reached out to more than a dozen schools that apparently did not accept funding, but got no responses.
 Two of the renaissance school systems were among the largest recipients of PPP. Mastery Schools of Camden, which enrolls 2,600 students in six schools, received a $5.2 million loan in April, the school disclosed.
 KIPP Cooper Norcross Academy, another renaissance network in Camden that educates 1,500, received $2 million to $5 million, and the Newark-based nonprofit that manages it also got $2 million to $5 million.
 Critics like Rubin note that as even as those schools applied for the money, they continued to receive their standard per-pupil funding that is covered by state and local taxpayers. The schools were also in line for the federal K-12 coronavirus relief that was another part of the stimulus law.
 In May, the state Department of Education announced more than $200 million of that public school aid. KIPP Cooper Norcross received $1.1 million from the kitty, Mastery Schools of Camden got $1.2 million and iLearn’s four charters got their combined $1.4 million.
 Some of those schools appear to carry healthy fund balances, well-compensated administrators and political clout, said Darcie Cimarusti, a spokeswoman for the Network for Public Education, a national advocacy group that has scrutinized PPP loans to charter schools.
 “Are you public or are you private?” asked Cimarustri, who is also a Highland Park school board member. “If you’re public, well, the other public schools in New Jersey are facing just as much uncertainty.”
 Nina Rees, president of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, said that because charter schools don’t receive as much public revenue as traditional public schools, they have to find other pots of money.
 “Fundraising is in the DNA of every single charter school leader,” Rees said, adding that charters couldn’t afford to ignore PPP. While conventional public schools can be kept open even if they are losing money, if a charter is in the red too long, it will have to close its doors, she said.

Gail’s retirement selfie interview 8.10.20
 Q. So you’re retiring, how do you feel about that?
 A. I feel excited, a little scared. When Keith and I were driving away from our wedding 39 years ago, I said it feels like we’re holding hands and jumping off a cliff together. Retiring feels like that. A big life change.
 Q. What do you plan to do?
 A. The three basic things I want to do are do volunteer work, travel again someday, and focus on my family (that includes everything from helping Keith and helping our kids, to researching family history).
 Q. You always ask people how old they are. Now the shoe’s on the other foot. How old are you?
 A. I’m 69. I’m a grandma! I’m older than the parents of the young reporters we hire nowadays. But Keith and I ran the virtual Sweet Pea 5k on Saturday. Actually for me it was more like a shuffle than running. But I didn’t stop and I finished!
 “Not dead yet!” is my motto.
 Q. How long have you been a journalist?
 A. I’ve worked for the Bozeman Daily Chronicle as an editor and reporter since February 4, 1983, so that’s more than 37 years. I graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1976 with a master’s degree in journalism, so that’s 44 years ago. I worked at California newspapers in Eureka and Bakersfield for six years before we moved to Bozeman. I think Chuck Johnson or Mike Dennison said I’m one of the longest serving reporters in the state.
 Q. Why did you become a journalist?
 A. Well, I’m the fourth generation in my family to work for newspapers. My great-grandfather was an editor for the Springfield Union in Massachusetts, my grandfather was a reporter there and an editor for the Providence Journal in Rhode Island, and my aunt was a reporter for the Detroit Free Press and Boston Globe.
 That’s my Mom’s side of the family. My Dad loved newspapers and politics, and I remember bringing a New York Times story to show-and-tell in fourth grade.
 So in college, when my history professor praised my writing, and my TA suggested I could go into journalism, that was very exciting. I’d always looked up to the journalists in my family as people on a high pedestal, something I could never hope to be good enough to attain.
 When I graduated from college in history, there were no jobs for reporters, so I applied to grad school at Berkeley, to learn a trade.
 I got in. But then I was afraid to walk into the journalism school. I was afraid they’d look at me and say, “But you’re too short to be a reporter!” and rescind my acceptance. I’m only 5 feet tall. Luckily there’s no height requirement.
 My dear grandfather was pretty dubious I would survive in the rough and tumble world of newspapers. So I’m proud that I’ve survived all this time. He retired at 67.
 Q. A lot of people think newspapers are dying. What do you think?
 A. I believe democracy needs us, imperfect as we are. I believe local newspapers like the Chronicle contribute a great deal to a community, to its sense of cohesion and personality and history. To being well informed about what its government is up to.
 Newspapers are clearly in big trouble, failing all over the country, because of competition from the Internet, hedge funds buying them up and sucking them dry, and young people especially preferring to read the news online, yet online editions only earn a fraction of the ad revenue.
 It’s pretty discouraging. Maybe we should consider the nonprofit model and beg for money, which seems to be working for public radio. Or find a rich billionaire like Jeff Bezos.
 I do worry about our future. Before my family had four generations of reporters, they were four generations of shoemakers, making shoes and boots by hand, and they were put out of business by new technology — shoe factories. Déjà vu all over again.
 But I still believe the country needs us. We must find a way to keep going.
 Q. What have been your favorite stories at the Chronicle?
 A. Wow, that’s a tough one.
 I’ve been so lucky to get to interview and cover amazing, inspiring people, often thanks to covering MSU.
 Eva Schloss, the Holocaust survivor and stepsister to Anne Frank.
 Elouise Cobell, the Blackfeet woman who fought for years to win back billions of dollars stolen from Native Americans.
 Bryan Stevenson, who fought to get justice for Black death row inmates in Alabama and created the national memorial to lynching.
 MSU students who volunteered with Engineers Without Borders to bring clean water to villages in Kenya.
 Barney Old Coyote, a Crow code talker in World War II who later helped start MSU’s Native American studies.
 I got to meet Lech Walesa, who led Poland’s Solidary movement against the communist regime, author Salman Rushdie, humanitarian Dr. Paul Farmer. I got to cover the amazing Maya Angelou.
 And I wrote some long profiles of Dorothy Eck, a Bozeman housewife who fought for rewriting the Montana Constitution and replacing smoke-filled rooms with open government.
 As a devoted history major, I have loved having the chance to write about history — including profiles of Bozeman’s colorful founders, John Bozeman and Nelson Story.
 I think I wrote the first full story in the Chronicle’s history on the tragedy of the 1870 Baker Massacre by U.S. troops from Bozeman’s Fort Ellis, who killed the wrong Blackfeet village, filled with women, children and old men.
 I’m proud that, while no one in town was really celebrating Bozeman’s 150th anniversary in 2014, I realized this milestone was coming up and wrote a big feature story (“Gamblers and dreamers: Wild West town of Bozeman 150 years ago”).
 I’ve won lots of newspaper awards over many years, and one I’m proudest of is the smallest plaque — for a 1993 series I wrote on abortion. I interviewed Bozeman’s only abortion doctor, the MSU grad student who later went to prison for trying to set her medical office on fire, volunteers who helped young women with unwanted pregnancies — a wide range of people and viewpoints – and won the Montana Newspaper Association’s community service award.
 I’m proud that Bob Rydell, MSU history professor, said when he was updating MSU’s centennial history book for its 125th anniversary, he relied a lot on my reporting. Newspapers really are the first draft of history.

For years, conservatives have responded to gun violence with angry renunciations of any links to gun proliferation or lax gun control laws, offering instead "thoughts and prayers."

WAMEGO — A Wamego tradition carried on this weekend with a few changes in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
 “Hoo Haw” opened at the Columbian Theatre in Wamego Friday. The variety show has been held for 16 years, and the cast was still going to crack their jokes, even through a mask.
 “I’m proud of people for accepting the challenge and going on with the show,” said director Troy Hemphill.
 “Hoo Haw” is a take on the classic variety show “Hee Haw” and features jokes, skits and live music. Hemphill, who has been involved with the show since it began 16 years ago, said the formula will remain familiar to people who have seen the show before, even if it looks slightly different.
 In order to create a safer setting, the theater removed every other row of seats and blocked off seats between parties to allow for physical distancing. Ticketing is entirely online. The theater also will sanitize the space before and after each performance.
 Actors wear masks on stage whenever distancing is not possible and the live band, the Pott County Posse, wears masks for the entire show. Hemphill said they also sanitize microphones regularly.
 Hemphill said it was kind of a relief to reach opening night. He said earlier in the year, there were questions about if the show would be possible this year.
 “All through the spring we were wondering if we were going to pull it off or not,” he said. “We wanted to but we didn’t want to put people in unnecessary danger.”
 Marissa Streeter, public relations coordinator for the Columbian, said the theater wanted to create a way for people to safely enjoy live entertainment. It is also a chance to support local arts and organizations. People can “buy” the empty seats between parties if they didn’t feel comfortable attending. The money benefits the Columbian and the Wamego Public Library.
 “People need to feel connection with other people and with the things they’re passionate about,” Streeter said.
 Hemphill said he thought people would really enjoy the live music, and he wanted to provide a chance to have some fun in a difficult time.
 “It’s exciting to have something to do and maybe be in a position to give people some laughter,” Hemphill said.
 Upcoming shows are at 7:30 p.m. Friday, Aug. 21, and Saturday, Aug. 22, and at 2 p.m Sunday, Aug. 23. Tickets are available at columbiantheatre.com or by phone at 785-456-2029.

In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the term "inner-city" was often used in connection with African-American neighborhoods. Soul icon Marvin Gaye had a major hit in 1971 with his political classic "Inner City Blues," which discussed economic frustrations in the black community. But gentrification has accelerated considerably in recent decades, forcing many working class African-Americans -- and working class whites and Latinos, for that matter -- to leave inner-city neighborhoods and look for more affordable housing in suburban areas. When African-Americans are forced out of Harlem and areas of Brooklyn by gentrification, skyrocketing rents and skyrocketing property taxes, they seek more affordable options in New Jersey. When African-Americans can no longer afford South Philly or West Philly, they look for housing in the Philadelphia suburbs of Montgomery County, Bucks County, Delaware County or Chester County.

You may not think twice about them after turning on your porch lamps at dusk and seeing little powdery, brown moths flock to the light source.
 But from the abundant owlet moths, which are typically the kind you’ll see flitting about your yard at night, to the mellow, yellow of a fluffy imperial moth, there are several species of eye-catching moths that can be spotted in your own backyard.
 These variations in size and color serve as deterrents to predators, said Anthony Zukoff, a Department of Entomology research scientist with K-State’s Southwest Research Extension Center, via email.
 “While some moths use camouflage to avoid predators, others use bright colors to deter would-be predators,” he said. “Bright colors can be a warning sign that the moth is toxic if ingested. Also, brightly colored patches on wings, sometimes called eyespots, can appear to be eyes and can act to intimidate predators.”
 Zukoff said there are many North American moths that have large ranges of habitable areas. This means the caterpillars develop on a variety of plants instead of just one particular species.
 “A moth in Kansas may be native to Kansas but also native to Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, et cetera,” he said. “Some moths are found across the entire country, so you could say they are simply native to North America. There are some moths that have extremely limited ranges, however. One very striking moth that does migrate and can be found in Kansas during the summer months is the Black Witch moth. It is large, dark and bat-like. This moth moves out of Mexico and migrates all the way to Canada.”
 Below are some species that have been spotted around Manhattan by residents:
 Luna moth
 Distinguished by bright-green wings that taper into a trail, the luna moth’s wings can stretch to 4 1/2 inches. Its caterpillars feed on leaves from walnut, hickory, sweet gum and other trees. It’s rare to spot an adult moth as they only live for a week. Once they have emerged from their cocoons, the moths do not have a mouth or digestive system, so they don’t eat.
 Cecropia moth
 Cecropia moths are the largest found in North America, with a wingspan of 5 to 7 inches. They’re known for their red-colored bodies and dark colored wings that are marked with white, red and tan bands and spots. This species also doesn’t eat as an adult because their sole purpose is to mate.
 Polyphemus moth
 The name hails from Polyphemus, a cyclops in Greek mythology who had one, large eye in the middle of his forehead. The polyphemus moth has distinctive eyespots on its lower wings. It can be found in all but the western third of Kansas, Zukoff said, but this moth is an example of one that can be found in most of North America. The caterpillars develop on several types of trees and shrubs, so their food source is plentiful.
 Imperial moth
 Imperial moths can vary in their coloration, but they are usually a combination of mottled yellow and brown. Their wings can reach from 3 to 7 inches, and the females are usually larger than males, while males are typically more marked than females.
 “The imperial moth in Kansas is restricted to the eastern portion of the state where prairie transitions to eastern deciduous woodland as the caterpillars develop on a variety of tree species,” Zukoff said.
 White-lined sphinx moth
 This particular moth is part of the Sphingidae family, more commonly known as hawk moths, sphinx moths and hornworms. They usually fly later in the day or night but also can be seen during the day occasionally. When massive populations build up, they emigrate to more northern areas.
 “The white-lined sphinx is one of the most common sphinx moths in the state,” Zukoff said. “The caterpillars eat a huge variety of plants. This sphinx can sometimes become a pest of tomatoes, like the tomato hornworm.”
 If you’re interested in trying to attract moths to your own yard, Zukoff said, there may be a few ways. He said one method is to set up a black light against a hanging, white sheet after dark.
 “This is called ‘black lighting’ and it will attract many species of insects, including moths,” he said. “Another method people use to attract moths is called ‘sugaring.’ This is when a mixture of fermenting or old fruit is smashed and mixed with a sugar of some type and then smeared on tree trunks or fence posts. Planting night-blooming flowers will attract moths as well, especially hawk moths.”

"I think this whole thing is a game of adjustments," said pitcher Adam Wainwright, the winning pitcher in Game 1 against the White Sox. "Obviously we had to tighten the ship a lot, but guys were trying to do the right thing before. You know, we sat inside during the game, trying to stay out of the dugout. Everybody had their masks on and used hand sanitizer and stuff, but unfortunately this thing is very contagious. It's easy to pass."

Upon questioning it was found that there was no eviction order. The Claimant reported that the items removed ought not to have been dumped because they were unique, collector’s items, electronics, antiques, paintings and very valuable. Among them a common GE Cordless phone and GE Digital Answering Machine. Estimated value is thousands of dollars. Threatened with conviction Mr Prosper gingerly volunteered to compensate for the initial items reported missing. The interviewing Officer after careful analysis of the Claimants complaint (that if the purpose was to repossess the premises then all of the items, including furnishings would also have been dumped.but instead they remained in the house) warned the Prospers that they should return any items they knew they had removed to their house and compensate the Claimant or be charged for a crime.

A healthy immune system turns inflammation on and off as needed, calling on white blood cells and sending out proteins to fight infection. Vaccines harness that inflammatory response. But blood tests show that obese people and people with related metabolic risk factors such as high blood pressure and elevated blood sugar levels experience a state of chronic mild inflammation; the inflammation turns on and stays on.

If it can be put on a bicycle, Rad Power Bikes probably offers it. With a slew of accessories, you can outfit one of their nine different bike models for cargo, kids, cargo with kids, or just riding through the mud.
 We got our hands on the RadRunner 1 with a rear bench and foot pegs. This particular configuration is great for a parent to get out and run errands with their little ones on board. The 48-volt, 14-amp-hour battery powers a 750-watt motor that can pedal-assist or throttle the RadRunner up to 20mph. With four levels of assistance, riders can increase or decrease to help conserve battery, if necessary, or make it up a steep incline.
 The step-through frame makes it easy to mount and dismount, even with a passenger or packages on the rear of the bike. The RadRunner is rated to support up to 300 pounds. I can assure you it does that as my passengers and I pushed past the weight limit without any problems.

2019 was already a difficult year for the Chinese hotel industry, affected by the external environment of decelerating global economic growth, rising protectionism and political tensions, the Pandemic which broke out in early 2020 was creating even more anxiety and pressure to the Chinese hoteliers. As set out in the 2019 Annual Report, the prosperity index of the hospitality industry, which is computed by a specific mathematical index model to quantify hotel employees' expectations of the future development of the hotel industry, for the 1st half of 2020 published by 浩華管理顧問公司 (Horwath HTL) a consulting firm and the division of Crowe Global specializing in hotel and tourism management consulting services in the Asia-Pacific region, has been falling to its lowest value since the second half of 2013. Throughout hotels nationwide, except for a few regions, performance fell across the board. In the background of a long- term steady growth in hotel supply but a decline in the growth of demand, the supply-demand imbalance has caused the decline in hotel occupancy and revenue per available room ("RevPAR"). Among which, the imbalance between supply and demand of high-end hotels has further intensified, and it is expected that this sub-market will continue to be under pressure going forward.

"It seemed like that was something that was known about him at the time, that he liked younger girls," Mason says in the documentary, after admitting that in the context of what the world knows about Epstein now, his bawdy little ditty reads a good deal creepier. "It's that odd thing of something that seems tongue in cheek, but you have no real sense of how utterly depraved his intentions were."
