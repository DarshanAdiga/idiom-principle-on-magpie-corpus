But one of the critical issues that you have to see is a clear cut indication that we're turning the corner and the cases are coming down. We saw that in China after much suffering. We're starting to see that a bit in Italy now and even in New York there are some very interesting and I think cautiously optimistic signs that the number of cases are starting to plateau and come down. Once they get over that hump and come down, they usually come down in a pretty steep way. When you start seeing that, then you can start thinking about the possibility of getting back to those first steps towards normal.

DR. FAUCI:   It's very difficult as hell. It depends on the degree to which certain regions, state, cities adhere to the mitigation. I think that, for the most part, the United States is doing very well. Obviously the things that you're concerned about is those areas where you have big cities. Every state has a metropolis in it, some much larger than others. So any situation where you have a concentration of people, the epitome of that is what we're seeing in New York, in New Orleans, in Detroit. Hopefully we would not see that kind of explosive infection that we did see unfortunately in New York and to some extent in New Orleans, Detroit and other places, but you have to be careful with cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. California and Washington state have actually done quite well in their mitigation to prevent that explosion of cases. But you have to be prepared that any particular location, city, town, or what have you is potentially a hotspot. And that's the reason why you can't relax your mitigation regardless of where you are. If you look at the map of the United States, there are cases all over the place, each of which is a little bit of an ember that can turn into a fire, and that's what you have to worry about.

First, parents of teenagers should resist sending them to do the grocery shopping. My wife and I made this mistake when we grew tired of all the chronically dramatic sighing and dispatched our two eldest daughters to Target for a few staple items. You can imagine how relieved we were when they arrived back home with a four-pack of canned Starbucks Double Shot Espresso, a family size bag of salt and vinegar potato chips, and three pints of Bluebell cookie dough ice cream. Thank goodness they remembered the essentials.
 Before you leave on your shopping trip, it’s important to wear the proper attire. If you’re like me, you’ve been spending your entire shelter-in-place period sporting pants that feature a drawstring. Naturally, you’ll want to dress a bit more formally out in public, unless you’re planning to brave the hordes at Walmart — where pajamas are the norm and pants are optional. Also, be sure to wear something you can strip off immediately and disinfect upon your arrival home. Your spouse’s bathrobe or a full-body Chewbacca costume should do the trick.

A Walter H. Durfee tall case clock with ball and claw feet and three brass finials atop sold for $4,375. Durfee was an antiques dealer who opened his own shop in Providence, R.I., in 1877 at the age of 20. A 2012 write up by Jay Holloway for The National Association of Watch & Clock Collectors reads, "Mr Durfee claimed that he bought and sold over 400 tall case clocks in his first 8 years in business. By mid 1880, Durfee decided to purchase new English bracket clocks and resell them in his antique shop in Providence RI. It was from this venture that Walter Durfee met the fine quality clock manufacturer in London of Jennens and Sons. Jennens and Sons sold their clocks directly to the public but also through leading jewelry stores in London, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Glasgow, New York and Boston. Jennens saw Durfee as another outlet for their products. Tall case clocks had a renewed popularity due to the song by William Clay Work known as 'Grandfathers Clock.' Durfee took this theme and began to have Jennens & Sons make tall case clocks for him."

“The reason we’re going ahead and doing it is to be one step ahead of the curve as several counties have done. Because at 2 o’clock in the morning I can’t flip a switch and say, ‘Get me a morgue here’ … we have to have it in place now,” said Seele.
 The morgue currently utilized by the coroner’s office, which is in a shared facility with Community Howard Regional Health, has cooler space for two bodies. Recently, the county undertook efforts to increase capacity by constructing a new morgue in the Howard County Government Building downtown. However, that project is not yet completed. A string of events last week, which included a suicide, a vehicle fatality, a murder, and three overdose deaths, put a strain on the coroner’s office, said Seele. That, in tandem with special procedures for dealing with suspected COVID-19 deaths and the potential need for space due to increased COVID-19 victims, necessitated the move to garner more room, according to the coroner.
 Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the coroner has had to adopt specialized procedures at the behest of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in dealing with COVID-19 deaths. According to Seele, these include additional protections while handling the remains of suspected COVID-19 victims, such as using more protective gear while working with these remains and treating bodies suspected to be contaminated with COVID-19 with a chemical that kills the virus. Additionally, his office must conduct post-mortem testing for suspected cases.

Artist and writer Helène Aylon--whose pathbreaking work reckoned with and entangled feminism, Judaism, pacifism, and environmental justice--died yesterday at age eighty-nine from COVID-19. Led by intuition and a feminist consciousness that often took experimentation, instability, and physical vulnerability as its guiding principle, Aylon is considered a pioneer of process art whose work also encompassed Jewish feminist scholarship and antinuclear activism. Her art has recently enjoyed new attention, with her first solo show in Los Angeles held earlier this year at Marc Selwyn Fine Art and her first New York solo exhibition since 1979 staged last year at Leslie Tonkonow gallery, which represents the artist. "While many of her male contemporaries were producing coolly detached demonstrations of painting's limits, Aylon, like Eva Hesse and Dorothea Rockburne, pursued the limitless, the infinite," wrote Lauren O'Neil-Butler in _Artforum_ 's April 2019 issue.
 Helène Greenfield was born in 1931 and raised in Borough Park's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn. At eighteen, she married to a rabbi, with whom she had two children. It was not until 1963, two years after her husband died from cancer, that she took the name Helène Aylon--an abridged Herbraic version of her first name, offered originally to a newspaper reporter. She began her artmaking and demurral of her conservative upbringing some five years prior, having secretly enrolled at Brooklyn College in 1958. There, she studied with Ad Reinhardt, who became a mentor and friend, and who introduced her to Mark Rothko. By the end of the '60s, she commenced her abstract process-driven "Elusive Silver" paintings (1969-73), which fused industrial materials including sheet metal, acrylic plastic, and spray paint. "I wanted the paintings to actually change like the earth changes, like we change, like everything does change," she said of the series in a 2019 interview with the _Brooklyn Rail_. "I didn't want to be a master producing a masterpiece but I sought the work to be created outside of my doing."
 When Aylon left New York for the San Francisco Bay Area in 1973, she was represented by Betty Parsons. That same year, she began using linseed oil on paper for her series "Paintings That Change in Time" (1973-76), about which critic Lawrence Alloway argued that the "slowness of the paintings' change rather than the fact of their change, is the crucial factor. They engage us in contemplation not analysis, expectation not description." Suzanne Hudson, reviewing Aylon's recent show in Los Angeles for _Artforum_ 's April 2020 issue, wrote that the artist "relished the provisional nature of assessment and addressed herself to the unfolding futures in which her efforts would-- recursively and ever differently--be received."
 In her 2012 book, _Whatever is Contained Must Be Released: My Jewish Orthodox Girlhood, My Life as a Feminist Artist_ , Aylon recalled that many feminist artists such as Louise Nevelson, Grace Hartigan, Lee Krasner, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Martin "had no children and were just fine about it," but said that she "loved being a mother." "Feminism did not embrace motherhood, it rather ran away from it," she once said. "My series _The Breakings_ [1977-79] was all about bursting," she said, referencing a work for which she poured several quarts of linseed oil onto paper affixed to Masonite panels, letting them sit on the floor for weeks while the oil developed a skin. Weeks later, with collaborators she referred to as "midwives"--Parsons, Nancy Spero, and Hannah Wilke among them--she would lift the panels and cause a breakage in which the oil escaped and evoked the process of childbirth.
 By the 1980s, Aylon had given up her studio practice to focus on the antinuclear movement, returning to New York with _The Earth Ambulance_ , 1982, for which she drove a truck across the US while piling earth from uranium mines and nuclear reactors into pillowcases, arriving back to her home state in time for a nuclear disarmament rally at the UN. The 1990s saw her revisiting her spiritual and cultural roots and examining the Torah and Jewish traditions through a feminist lens.
 Aylon's art resides in the collections of the Jewish Museum, New York; the Morgan Library and Museum, New York; the Oakland Art Museum; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.

OGDENSBURG, N.Y. (WWNY) - St. Lawrence County gets the upper hand on sales tax. That leaves Ogdensburg and other municipalities fearful.Ogdensburg, villages and towns are bracing for what's next in sales tax negotiations with the county. A change in state law has given the county the upper hand.“It means we're in a much more difficult place to negotiate with the county,” said Mike Skelly, Ogdensburg mayor.How the last 1 percent of sales tax is shared was formerly written into state law. But a renewal of that law now puts that decision into the county's hands.“We still are fiscally distressed. While we were improving...this is such an insurmountable setback,” said Skelly.Ogdensburg gets about $900,000 per year from its share. The county says the plan is to continue to talk with Ogdensburg.“It's just to negotiate with the city in good faith and come up with a solution. That's all we're trying to do,” said David Forsythe, county legislator.Forsythe said a consensus has developed not to change the split for villages and towns. The focus now is on Ogdensburg.City officials said they're not dead in the water on this issue. They said, as a city, Ogdensburg could elect to collect the 1 percent sales tax on its own.Nobody knows if that's more or less than it gets now. State Senator Patty Ritchie submitted a bill to keep the current split in state law. But in this year's hurried budget process, the language was stripped.“I don't think that it would benefit anyone in the county if Ogdensburg is pushed off the fiscal cliff,” said Ritchie (R. - 48th District).County and city must act soon on the sales tax split. Before long, municipalities across the county will start their budget planning for next year.Copyright 2020 WWNY. All rights reserved.

Thus far, Seele said his office has had to deal with four cases of suspected COVID-19 deaths. Two, after testing, were potential cases, but tests came back negative for the virus. One was a confirmed case before death. Results were pending on another and, as of press time Friday, Howard County had two confirmed deaths from the virus.
 Regardless, he said precautions must be taken with any suspected case. But, while waiting for test results to come back, his office must hold remains until the results are received. This puts additional strain on the existing morgue, as well as local funeral homes that, in the past, have allowed for the storage of bodies when capacity issues were experienced. Social distancing restrictions have caused some funeral homes to hold bodies for extended periods as families wait for the ability to have proper funeral services. This limits the coroner’s ability to rely on funeral home space for bodies.
 “We’re making arrangements as we speak for a temporary morgue holding, especially if we get into these situations where we have to hold the remains for a while,” said Seele. “Obviously, I’m limited on space already. The funeral homes will be pushed to the max already. If there’s a way we can release to the funeral homes immediately we will.”
 As to where the temporary morgue will be located, Seele said that’s yet to be determined as officials zero in on a few potential locations.
 Seele said his office will lease the temporary morgue for two months at a cost of $5,800. He anticipated it would be capable of holding between eight and 10 bodies.
 “It’s an expense, but I hope we don’t have to use it,” said Seele. “But we better do it. I just looked at the numbers … This is going to ramp up pretty quickly on us.”

It doesn't have to be a classical mass because you don't want to take away from the masks that the healthcare workers need. But if you're in a situation where it is difficult to stay six feet away or in a situation less than 10 people, which is what the guidelines say, then there are certain things that you could do and a mask is one of them. Also, you could stagger shifts, number factories of doing that instead of having just the daytime shift. Maybe go around the clock and have half the people come in in one shift and half the people come in the other to keep the distancing physically from each other. But I'm not a factory manager, but I'm just thinking of that as a possibility.

KITTERY, Maine - The president of the largest combined union at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard said Tuesday he has asked shipyard leadership that the military installation temporarily shut down to prevent further spread of the coronavirus.
   
 Richard Smith, president of the Portsmouth Federal Employees Metal Trades Council, spoke one day after the Navy announced a civilian employee at PNSY died of complications from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, on Sunday, April 5. Smith said leadership has confirmed to the workforce five additional positive cases of the virus associated with the Navy base.
   
 Smith has since raised the idea of "shutting down for a couple weeks."
   
 "We put the idea out there, gave them our concerns why," Smith said. "We feel that it's best for the shipyard and the employees to do this. But it's above everybody at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and the leadership here, it has to go out to the Navy."
   
 However, the head of another union didn't agree, saying, "We're seeing more transmission come from the grocery store than we are at the shipyard."
   
 With a workforce of nearly 8,000, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has been deemed essential to the nation's defense by the Trump administration during the health pandemic. A shipyard spokesperson said Tuesday there are "no plans" to cease operations.
   
 Smith said he worries greatly about the virus "when it starts hitting the boats." The Metal Trades Council represents nine local unions and approximately 2,800 employees at PNSY.
   
 "We look at York County, the numbers are growing," he said. "A lot of our people come from the Biddeford-Sanford area."
   
 York County currently has 115 of the confirmed 519 cases statewide. It has the second highest rate of confirmed infection, behind Cumberland County with 253 cases.
   
 Gary Hildreth, deputy public affairs officer for PNSY, responded to questions about Smith's statements.
   
 "Since the beginning of our COVID-19 response, shipyard leadership has maximized telework, remote work, and use of administrative leave in the interest of the safety of our entire shipyard team," Hildreth said in a prepared statement. "In addition, multiple COVID-19 mitigating measures have been implemented in accordance with CDC, OSHA and and secretary of defense guidelines. Our goal is to minimize the spread of COVID-19, while maximizing the execution of our mission. At the forefront of every decision is the protection of those aboard Portsmouth Naval Shipyard as we continue our mission-essential work to deliver submarines to the fleet. The shipyard has no plans to close or cease operations."
   
 A Navy spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
   
 Larry Dennis, president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, is not keen on the idea of a shutdown.
   
 "For me, to go that far, I don't see it as being feasible at this time because what's the correct solution?" Dennis said. "I'm not in full agreement with curtailing the entire operation."
   
 Dennis argued that sending the entire workforce home for two weeks could result in Portsmouth Naval Shipyard becoming "ground zero" for the coronavirus upon its reopening.
   
 "You better have a plan in place to make sure if we shut down for two weeks ... you'd almost have to put everyone in one place and say, 'You guys can't go anywhere,' to minimize people's movements," he said.
   
 Dennis said he felt the shipyard is already down to a "pretty limited number of individuals" physically on yard every day, and the workers his union represents have seen their risks "seriously mitigated" by being able to take almost all of their work off the shipyard.
   
 "The shipyard is doing everything they can to minimize that risk," he said.
   
 Meanwhile, the Department of Defense has issued new guidance that will essentially bring back to the shipyard a large number of employees who had been taking administrative leave.
   
 The new guidance changes how employees are permitted to use administrative leave, also known as weather and safety leave, which had previously been granted to many employees who were either high-risk, caring for high-risk individuals or exhibiting possible COVID-19 symptoms.
   
 The change orders caregivers who were on administrative leave to return to work April 14, and those with symptoms or sickness to shift to using their own sick leave.
   
 Ultimately, the new policy will bring more people back onto Seavey Island, essentially reversing efforts of shipyard officials to lessen the numbers of individuals coming onto the yard each day through its implementation of telework and other remote work options.
   
 Smith said leadership and labor have been working "side by side" during the health pandemic, citing a relationship stronger than in decades past.
   
 However, he urged officials to consider safety first.
   
 "I would really consider stepping back a bit and take a good look at the freight train," Smith said. "It's coming. We had that one death, we have others really sick from it. We really need to step back a little bit and see if we can shut us down for a couple weeks and see if we could get this under control."
   
 Asked if he thought if a shutdown of the government-owned shipyard was possible, Smith said, "Nothing's impossible, especially when it's a pandemic like what's going on. We feel that this could be for the best of everybody."
   
 In a statement to the workforce Tuesday, PNSY Cmdr. Capt. Daniel Ettlich said the new guidance on administrative leave "limits my flexibility."
   
 He then detailed "layers of protection" the yard has deployed since the onset of the pandemic, including hand-washing, work space cleanliness, health screening, social distancing, masks and face shields, no touch ID checks, and distributed workforce and telework.
   
 Ettlich also noted there is a portion of the workforce currently making masks for employees, after the DOD announced this week it will now require face coverings at all of its facilities.
   
 The Navy recently came under national scrutiny for its firing last week of the USS Roosevelt's captain for ringing the alarm about the coronavirus on board the ship. On Tuesday, Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly submitted his letter of resignation following remarks he made about the captain caused an uproar.
   
 Both Maine Congressman Jared Golden and Congresswoman Chellie Pingree on Tuesday called for Modly's resignation. Golden's statement expressed his "continuing concern over the Navy's refusal to seriously address the public health threats facing the shipbuilding workforce across the country."
   
 Seventy-nine perfect of the Roosevelt crew have since been tested for COVID-19, with 230 positive cases so far, the Navy said Tuesday. The ship is currently at port in Guam.
   
 There are currently 661 positive cases of the virus Navy-wide, and there have been two civilian deaths, including the one connected to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.
   
 Maine Gov. Janet Mills said during a press conference Tuesday that she and other elected officials are "pressuring the (Navy) everyday for better flexibility."
   
 "I've expressed to the vice president directly and the Navy the dire need for the department to become flexible and be flexible in the terms of its contracts, for instance Bath Iron Works, so we can ensure health and safety at the workplace for all our workers," Mills said. "My condolences go out to the individual who worked at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and tragically came down with the virus somewhere and passed away from it.... I'm hoping the Navy will start bending the rules a little bit."

WASHINGTON (AP) — As Congress races to craft the next coronavirus rescue package, President Donald Trump's sudden request Tuesday to pump $250 billion more into a just-launched payroll program for small businesses may hit roadblocks.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said more money is needed for the popular new $350 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which took off with a start last Friday but was quickly overrun as companies jumped at the chance to tap up to $10 million in forgivable loans to keep paychecks flowing amid the stay-home shutdown. He requested the funds in private calls to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Democrats largely support it as a component of a broader new aid package, but McConnell wants to swiftly jam it through Congress this week, even though the House and Senate all but shuttered.“The way it’s going, we’re going to need that, because the people are loving it,” Trump said in a conference call with banking executives open to the press.The push for the hefty sum, now heading for a vote with just 48 hours notice, threatens to upset the fragile agreement between the political leaders that more needs to be done amid the pandemic and its stark economic shutdown.The House was already preparing to boost the small business program as part of a broader $1 trillion package Pelosi wants as a follow-up to the sweeping $2.2 trillion rescue that became law in late March.With jobless rates soaring to record highs, Pelosi called the small business program “very important" Tuesday.But Pelosi also said she wants assurances the money flying out the door is going to those who need it. “We do have to have oversight to make sure everybody who qualifies has access,” she said on CNN.By jumping ahead, McConnell, the Republican leader, could upend the bipartisan dynamic usually needed to secure support for a broader package. Democrats said they were not consulted. The action is set for Thursday.“Jobs are literally being saved as we speak,” McConnell said in a statement announcing his move.“Congress will need to provide more funding or this crucial program may run dry. That cannot happen,” he said.Underscoring the tension, the push comes as Trump sidelined the acting inspector general tasked with leading oversight of the $2.2 trillion rescue package, the biggest of its kind in history.The paycheck program is one of the main pillars in Washington's effort to salvage the economy and shore up suddenly out-of-work Americans as the coronavirus crises rips through communities nationwide.Through it, a small business can use 75% of the loan to keep paying its employees and the other 25% to meet overhead such as rent and utilities. The payroll protection is for eight weeks and if the business keeps its employees on the payroll or rehires workers who have been laid off, the loan will be forgiven.The program just began operating last Friday but the rollout has been plagued by a host of problems. Small business owners have complained that they are unable to get through to the SBA or the banks to apply for loans or they are being rejected by banks who say they are only accepting applications from businesses that are already customers of the bank.“We were so successful that we were concerned we were going to run out of money,” Mnuchin said during an event at the White House.The Federal Reserve intervened on Monday, saying it would buy the loans that banks make, a way to nudge hesitant lenders.By creating a backstop on the loans, the Fed is giving the banks an incentive and freeing up more of their cash for lending.The decision by McConnell to march ahead faces an uncertain outcome. It's unclear if his gambit for a stand-alone vote on the paycheck program will send it through the the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-run House.With Congress adjourned except for perfunctory pro-forma sessions, such a vote would require either the unanimous consent of all lawmakers or a simple voice vote without a formal roll call. There could be objections.House minority leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Ca., backed McConnell’s effort for a smaller, discrete infusion for the small business program. “The House should move swiftly to do the same,” he said in a statement.But the overture sets up a showdown with Democrats led by Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York who on Tuesday called for up to $25,000 “heroes” pay for frontline health care and service industry workers.Schumer declared the pay hike for nurses, truck drivers grocery store clerks and others the “highest priority.”Bigger corporations would be expected to foot the bill for the pay hike, he said, while the federal government would provide funding for smaller firms.The House bill is expected to include the small business boost alongside another round of $1,200 direct payments, unemployment benefits and food stamp assistance. Some Democrats, including freshman class president Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., are also seeking as much as $250 billion to smaller municipalities that face mounting costs to care for sick Americans and shore up their own economies.The shifting dynamics from the political leaders are stark amid what officials warn could be one of the toughest weeks for the country, as the number of confirmed cases and deaths climbs.The House gaveled in for a perfunctory pro forma session with Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Ca., presiding — wearing a face mask sewn by his young daughter.This would be the fourth package from Congress since the start of the virus outbreak. Two initial efforts were followed by the third last month, which was by far the largest, the most ambitious of its kind in U.S. history.___Associated Press writers Kevin Freking, Zeke Miller, Martin Crutsinger and Laurie Kellman contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

One, they faulted the claim - by the military chiefs - that insurgents and armed bandits had been routed in the areas in question, to an extent to warrant the withdrawal of military personnel. Two, even if the claims were true, that the Nigeria Police is not in a position to meaningfully garrison the areas claimed to have been rid of insurgents and bandits. It is not certain whether or not the authorities went ahead with that plan but last week, the issue of the “militarization” of the geo-political space took centre stage again following the incident in Warri, Delta State, in which a soldier shot dead a 35-year old man, Joseph Pesu, for disobeying the lockdown orders. In retaliation, youths in the area reportedly descended on the soldiers and killed one of them. Up till now, reports have it that tension is still mounting over alleged plans by soldiers in the area to avenge the killing of their colleague. Already, the army authorities have arrested some soldiers caught in a video threatening to rape women in the area following the incident.

YORK, Maine -- Town leaders have created a wellness-check initiative that connects community leaders and specialists with people who may need some help during the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 The goal of the program, called York Health, is to assist town residents who may be more vulnerable during this time. The efforts include a volunteer- powered phone tree to call and check in with community members who may be isolated or have other needs.
   
 Amber Harrison, the town's code enforcement officer and health officer, and Liz Cooper, special events coordinator for York Parks & Recreation, are the leaders organizing the York Health effort.
   
 Harrison and Cooper said they are compiling a list of seniors in isolation, people in quarantine, students and parents in need, first responders dealing with treating coronavirus, and anyone in need of extra care or help.
   
 "We're trying to hit all populations and all organizations in York to connect them with resources, and positive messaging during this time," Cooper said.
   
 "This has also happened organically around the same time," she said. "People would call the police or us and say, 'Can you check on my elderly neighbor?' or 'Can you possibly help this person with getting food?' That sort of thing."
   
 Harrison said people are encouraged to add to the list. "Everyone is welcome," she said.
   
 The task force consists of about 20 people, including representatives from both the town and state, many with mental health training, Harrison said. The group includes York Hospital officials, licensed psychiatrists, officials from the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, police officers, local clergy, school district personnel, Caring Unlimited addiction recovery specialists and York Housing Authority representatives.
   
 Additionally, the task force has York Community Services Association workers, workers from Sentry Hill Assisted Living Community, and mental health specialists from Sweetser, a nonprofit community mental health provider with a statewide network of care offering services in mental and behavioral health.
   
 "We're all in this together, and we're going to get through this together," Harrison said.
   
 Cooper echoed that sentiment and said people should "feel OK with not being OK."
   
 "It's OK however you feel, whatever you're going through," she said. "Try not to compare yourself to others. Everyone deals with stress and different events differently, and that's OK."
   
 The York Health initiative is contacting first responders and health care workers treating COVID-19 patients.
   
 "We wanted to supplement what the human resource departments for fire, EMS/EMT and hospital workers are doing," Harrison said.
   
 Another population served by York Health is the aging residents in York. Some 200 seniors are being contacted, in coordination with the Center for Active Living, through a phone-tree that is run mainly by volunteers.
   
 "For seniors in isolation, it's important their socialization isn't cut off," Cooper said. "It's a scary time for them. Many don't have access to social media. We want to be there to support them."
   
 Cooper and Harrison intend to create a weekly print and digital newsletter that focuses on positive messaging, valuable community programs, places to ask for help or to provide volunteer services.
   
 "We're going to have words of encouragement, we're going to provide valuable information, and we're going to show we're a community united and we're all in this together," Harrison said.
   
 The newsletter will be posted on the Parks and Recreation and the town's websites, public access television, town email blasts, social media, and printed for some, such as seniors in assisted living centers.
   
 The services Harrison and Cooper are highlighting include the no-touch food delivery service, where volunteers shop using Hannaford gift cards purchased by the town through emergency funding. Volunteers drop the food on the doorstep of those in need.
   
 Harrison is a member of the town's COVID-19 Task Force, a group of health care leaders, first responders and muncipal department heads who meet to coordinate the town's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Harrison said during the Task Force meetings, reports of people feeling great distress and anxiety were surfacing, and said she was inspired "to do more to better connect the community to vital resources." She said she was inspired by a briefing from Dr. Nirav Shah, in which the Maine CDC director spoke about coping during coronavirus.
   
 "He said normal coping mechanisms during COVID-19 aren't there. You can't go to church, you can't go visit a friend, you can't go to school, you can't hug someone," Harrison said.
   
 "This is an unprecedented time," she added, "and with the events occurring, it's OK not to know what happens next and to feel anxious about that."
   
 Harrison and Cooper can be reached via email at aharrison@yorkmaine.org and lcooper@yorkmaine.org. Newsletter updates will be posted online at www.yorkparksandrec.org.
   
 To reach town officials with non-emergency questions during the shutdown, please email covid@yorkmaine.org or call (207) 363-1000.
