"The cartels have the ability to make your life miserable or, alternatively, they have ways in which they can contain the most gruesome violence if the government looks the other way and there's at least an implicit agreement that 'alright, I'll look the other way, but you guys keep it down.'" Payan said. "The question is why would the president himself do it himself? Usually, you send somebody down to talk to the cartels to sort of understand what they want. But why would you put your own reputation, your image on the line?"

The dam that collapsed under pressure from an icy flood had a history of unaddressed ice issues and had no formal emergency plan because regulators wrongly assumed that no one would die if it failed, according a report released Tuesday April, 21, 2020.

BEST LATE-ROUND DRAFT PICK: Bo Jackson. The 1985 Heisman Trophy winner was selected first overall by Tampa Bay in 1986 but ended up playing baseball instead. That didn't stop the Raiders from using a seventh-round pick on Jackson in 1987. Davis allowed Jackson to play both sports, and the move paid off quickly when Jackson ran for 221 yards and two TDs in his fifth game with the Raiders that season. He played only 38 games over four seasons with the Raiders before a career-ending hip injury in the playoffs following the 1990 season. Jackson is one of four players since the NFL-AFL merger with two TD runs of at least 90 yards.

Morawetz says the court will not resume jury selection and jury trials until September at the earliest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Morawetz says the court will monitor the situation and give further direction next month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Until then, he says, all criminal matters that had already been rescheduled for June due to COVID-19 restrictions should keep their dates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The rescheduling of civil jury matters will be left to each region of the court.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The court has continued to hear urgent matters during this time, with some hearings carried out via teleconference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The provincial court, which handles the majority of criminal cases, also dramatically cut back its operations last month in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The Ontario Court of Justice suspended all family and criminal trials as well as preliminary inquiries until June, and has not issued new instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Justice officials continue to oversee bail, remand and plea courts for accused people in custody, as well as plea court for urgent cases involving accused people not in custody.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          They are also available to preside over urgent family proceedings and other matters deemed essential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Any matters that do proceed are to be heard by telephone or video conferencing unless ordered otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Some legal experts have raised concerns that the temporary suspension of most court operations could have significant long-term consequences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The Supreme Court of Canada made allowances for exceptional circumstances when it imposed strict time limits on court cases, which means any cases that were abruptly stalled likely won't be compromised, experts have said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          But it's possible the exemption won't be applied to later cases held up by snowballing delays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     		                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Even though you're only getting a print of this artwork instead of a real painting, the textures on this illustration make it look incredible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Voor Concert at Sea sneuvelt de jubileumeditie die eind juni zou plaatsvinden. ,,Het doet pijn dit te moeten melden. Net als jullie keken we weer erg uit naar het jaarlijks hoogtepunt op de Brouwersdam, maar het is helaas niet anders”, reageert BLØF-frontman Paskal Jakobsen op de gedwongen afgelasting van ‘zijn’ festival. BLØF organiseert Concert at Sea sinds 2006 jaarlijks in Zeeland, dit jaar zou het festival voor de vijftiende keer plaatsvinden. ,,Wij hadden ons vijftienjarig jubileum anders voorgesteld”, concludeert de festivalorganisatie.

I think it might work for a while before it will collapse, before it will start to be a government of deadlock rather than an effective government," he said.


  The unprecedentedly high number of ministers in Israel's new government also raises questions of its ability to function efficiently. Under the deal, the two blocs will have 16 ministers each, but after the coronavirus emergency, their number is said to grow to 36 in total, making it the largest in the nation's history.


  Yet, according to Weizmann, the government may still properly function through special ministerial committees, such as, for example, the security and foreign policy cabinet or the coronavirus emergency cabinet.


  "A 36-member government is at best a debate club, not a decision-making organ and both Netanyahu and Gantz know it. That is why the agreement between the two clearly states that reduced cabinets and ministerial committees will be formed ... Hence, the government will actually function through these cabinets and ministerial committees," Weizmann said.


  Contemplating about the survivability of the coalition, the expert noted that it was difficult to predict and depended on a number of factors.


  "By and large, I would say that this coalition will last as long as Netanyahu believes it serves his needs and interests," Weizmann said.


  Other variables, according to him, could be legal impediments, an economic or security crisis, such as intifada, or any other national and international crises.


  Rahat, in turn, did not rule out that the coalition might be short-lived, but underlined that the sides had made arrangements to make it long-term, including clauses that would prevent Netanyahu from avoiding handing the premiership over to Gantz.


  "This is an agreement between two people who do not believe each other," he stressed.


  In the March 2 election, both Netanyahu's right-wing bloc and Gantz's centrist camp fell several seats short of the parliamentary majority needed to form a government. In mid-March, the Blue and White chief won a mandate to form a government with the recommendations of 61 lawmakers in the 120-seat Knesset, a rather thin margin, and entered into talks on a national unity government with Netanyahu at the latter's invitation in order to jointly address the national crisis prompted by the spread of the COVID-19.


  The parties failed to reach a unity government deal before the deadline, and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Thursday sent the mandate to the Knesset, tasking lawmakers with forming a government within 21 days.

You probably jammed something under the gum, like a popcorn husk. Take a piece of floss and tie a bunch of knots in it. Floss the tooth on all sides and drag the now through all the spaces between the teeth adjacent to this tooth. Irrigate with a water pick. Brush vigorously. Rinse with a mix of 50% H2O and 50% peroxide. For pain apply any over the counter item that contains benzocaine. Do not press an aspirin against the gum; you will burn a hole through the tissue the size of……..well… an aspirin of course!

In Austria, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said all shops will be up and running at the beginning of May and restaurants in mid-May. He said the government will watch closely and will “pull the emergency brake if that is necessary.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

SPENCER -- In a spot where cars are often lined up along Route 9 watching Christmas lights blink to the beat of holiday songs, a tall pine tree is decked out in red, white and blue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "It's a Hope Tree," Laurie Letendre of A Arsenault & Sons, Inc. landscaping company said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The tree is part of a program by the Christmas Decor company of which the Spencer landscape business is a franchisee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Initially, the franchise owners across the country were going to decorate a simple white tree to display but then, the creativity flowed and the flag tree, across from Spencer's public safety complex, became the symbol for A Arsenault.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The franchise owners are raising money for local causes and Letendre said she chose to set up a GoFundMe page seeking $7,500 to purchase three electrostatic sprayers that can be used to disinfect vehicles and offices at the police, fire departments and rescue squad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "We're lighting the tree to give hope and when we thought about who we could help, we thought about our first responders," she said, noting that they're right across the street from A Arsenault's office on 16 West Main St.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The company also decorates the three departments, at no charge, for the winter holidays and does the same at Sherry's House in Worcester, and the Ronald McDonald House in Boston.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Police Chief David B. Darrin said word of the fundraiser for the sprayers was welcome news. He said a private company had sprayed the cruisers and he was hoping to get one of the devices for his department, though they're hard to come by with the current COVID-19 pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  He said the device is filled with a special disinfectant which is then positively charged, causing it to stick to surfaces rather than wafting through the air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "It dries quickly and won't damage things like computers," the chief said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Darrin said the gesture from Letendre is "lovely" and has become the norm these days with generous residents dropping off hand wipes, Klem's donation N-95 face masks and Leveillee Architectural Millwork in Spencer creating and donating face shields for officers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "People have been just great," Darrin said. "There's one more thing we need them to do and that is to do what the governor says and maintain distance. We're not out of the woods with this yet."

Deloire said, “The public health crisis provides authoritarian governments with an opportunity to implement the notorious “shock doctrine” to take advantage of the fact that politics are on hold, the public is stunned and protests are out of the question, in order to impose measures that would be impossible in normal times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

You've previously heard experts say that it takes 21 days to make or break a habit, but since then some experts have suggested that it might actually take longer depending on how deep-rooted the habit has become. Don't get discouraged and don't fret. With will power, a little help from supportive friends or family members, and a dogged determination you can leave the person you don't want to be behind you and you will instead become the person you've always wanted to be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

"A good breakfast before getting down to work sets the foundation for a good day," she said. "And while fast food and chips may be a quick fix to the everyday lunchtime panic, too much processed food can lead to feelings of fatigue and lethargy," she warned. "Too much sugar can lead to a temporary sugar rush followed by a crash, so consider substituting processed foods with wholesome alternatives like fruits, nuts, whole grain foods, and/or yoghurt to snack on that are high in vitamins, minerals, protein and fibre. And remember to stay hydrated!"

The controversial idea to importing millions of pine seedlings has been under discussion in Armenia, since the number of available seedlings is insufficient. In response, ATP published a position paper in January with several recommendations. These included a strong argument against importing and planting non-native seedlings, a recommendation to plant mixed species forests in order to allow a more healthy forest to evolve, and alternative ways of reforesting that don’t solely rely upon container plantings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

As appreciative and grateful I am for all of the opportunities given to us, it is still very difficult for all of us, even Coach. Coach has always been known to just go with the flow and fly by the seed of his pants, but this isn’t an option now. He has admitted that this is his weakness as a coach but yet he does it anyways. He posts and sets up team zooms, he gives us readings and spaces to vent. Everyday he works hard to overcome what he believes is his weakness. This is the most motivational part of it all, if he is willing to work on his weakness, there is no reason why we shouldn’t be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Alexa Bailey, who was the point guard of those legendary BNL teams and an Indiana All-Star in her own right, originally started her college career at Butler before finishing it out at the University of Indianapolis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And even though she didn't technically transfer, Allen's older sister, Jenna, who was the third Indiana All-Star in that loaded 2015 class at BNL, originally committed to play at IU before decommitting and spending her four collegiate seasons at Big Ten rival Michigan State.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Just like these former BNL standouts, many college basketball players and fans alike are starting to realize that sometimes it takes a year or two for a college athlete to realize they didn't make the right decision at first. Whether it's their role on the team, injury problems, a coaching change or any other factors that might go into the decision to transfer, sometimes a change of scenery is needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And what many of those same players and fans are realizing is how huge of an impact these transfers can have on their new teams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Even in Bloomington at IU, both the men's and women's teams have taken advantage of the options within the transfer portal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Former Notre Dame transfer Ali Patberg, who was the star of the Columbus North team that ended BNL's chance at a third straight state title in 2015, was the leading scorer on IU's women's team this year and was joined in the Hoosiers' starting lineup by another transfer in Brenna Wise, who came over from Pittsburgh. Meanwhile, the men's team had a transfer starter of its own in former Southport star Joey Brunk, who originally started his college career at Butler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And as for those former BNL players, McBryde left Purdue and became a key piece in Arizona winning the WNIT championship in 2018-19 and then rising to No. 12 in the nation in 2019-20. During McBryde's senior year, she finished tied for fourth in the Pac-12 in steals per game and became the first player in program history to shoot both 50 percent from the field and 40 percent from three-point range in a season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    While Jenna Allen was able to spend all four of her seasons at Michigan State, she helped the Spartans become one of the best teams in the conference during that time by averaging 8.4 points and 4.5 rebounds over the course of her career. She was a career 1,000-point scorer for the Spartans as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And Bailey immediately became an important part of her new team when she arrived at UIndy, starting 18 games in 21 appearances, playing 31 minutes per game and averaging 6.1 points, 4.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists and nearly two steals per game in her first season as a Greyhound in 2017-18. Some injury problems held her back during her senior season but she was still able to put up similar number to the year before regardless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Now Jorie will get an opportunity to be one of those in a long line of success stories when it comes to Bedford transfers. Transfer rules regarding players sitting out a year are still up in the air due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so she may get that opportunity sooner rather than later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Whether she has to sit out a year or not, all she has to do is look at what some of those other former Stars accomplished at their second go-arounds to know those opportunities to flourish are certainly there at a new school — as long as you continue to put in the work of course.

A Nebraska dam that collapsed under pressure from an icy flood had a history of unaddressed ice issues and had no formal emergency plan because regulators wrongly assumed that no one would die if it failed, according a report released Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

With many oil tanks filling up, the federal government is negotiating with companies to store crude oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But if all the storage tanks are full, oil companies will begin shutting in wells, which can damage oil fields.

Lazier spent only full-time season on the CART circuit. He finished ninth in the standings that season, was the series top rookie and qualified 13th in his only Indianapolis 500 start. An engine failure forced Lazier to drop out of the race after 154 laps, dropping him to 19th.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

What about food relief for the ever-growing number of us who have lost our jobs? Our traditional food relief product is powdered milk, but those plants are specialized, too. They produce bulk-sized containers of products normally made for further processing. They were already operating at full capacity before COVID-19 came calling. Producing and diverting products intended for non-grocery use will require government actions or a complete retooling of that portion of our industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Meanwhile, cows keep producing milk. Farmers are too often caught in the middle with no processor to buy their milk. The rest struggle to make it on prices that don’t cover production costs, much less leave anything for family living. Farmers worry about the virus sickening essential farm workers. They worry that their bankers won’t stay with them. They worry that any government help that comes their way will be a day late and a dollar short. Farmers see first-hand the horror of the wonderful food they have worked so hard to produce literally going to waste down the drain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I see this tragedy play out every day. Believe me, it’s really getting to me. Make no mistake, every dairy farmer I work with is on your side. They work day in and day out to make sure Americans have plenty of quality milk products at reasonable prices. They and you are in this together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I hope and pray that our road out of this will be short and smoothly paved. No matter what, I hope that understanding and cooperation will guide us as we face the coming challenges affecting everyone from our farms to your home.

Once a top-performer with triple the current assets, Hasenstab's Global Bond Fund has become a laughing joke, losing 7.6% in the past year compared with a double-digit return for Treasuries. Morningstar meanwhile mainstains its top analyst rating for the fund in October and said in a February note the “often contrarian approach” tends to pay off in the long run. Newsflash here, maybe, for Morningstar but you can't be a contrarian when you had a position that lost billions and you unwound it. That's called just being a plain terrible investor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Thankfully, many are not waiting for "the time we are waiting for" to do the work of justice. Indeed, educational work and organizing have taken on new online and social-distance-respecting forms. While advocates have been busy doing behind the scenes work to get refugees released from immigration detention centres, for example, others have organized drive-by protests with the same goal. In Vancouver last weekend, Indigenous and non-Indigenous people without the luxury of having a home to shelter in took over an empty school. Unfortunately, this safe space did not last long, as Mayor Kennedy Stewart's Vancouver Police riot squad raided the school at 2 a.m. and criminalized those inside. On Sunday in Denver, meanwhile, nurses wearing scrubs and face asks physically blocked the pathway of Trump supporters protesting social distancing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

But has there ever been a time where the “it can’t hurt and it might help’’ theory is more applicable? The masks take some getting used to, but before long, they become second nature, kind of like wearing seat belts when driving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Furthermore, have you seen some of the fashion statements being made by these masks? While the standard issue variety come mostly in white, the homemade types tout such things as favorite sports teams and cartoon characters. If sewing had become a lost art, it’s making a roaring comeback now. Perhaps a budding fashion designer or two are becoming acquainted with the craft through making masks.

It should be all of us, that’s who.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Last week, they were divided on whether to accept a 12.5 per cent cut. Now, apart from Mesut Ozil and two others, they have all signed up.
 There is still a hope at the club all three will change their minds and intend to keep talking.
 But Arteta has needed all of his mental strength to cope with everything thrown at him since he took charge in December.
 His first home game was all about questions over Granit Xhaka ­leaving the club because the Swiss midfielder seemed certain to go after f­alling out of favour with the fans ­during Unai Emery’s disastrous reign.
 It was the first sign of Arteta’s clever man-management, getting Xhaka back on board and slowly the fans have taken to him again.
 Arteta has dramatically improved Arsenal as a team and, ironically, at the heart of that has been Ozil, who was cast aside and ostracised under Emery’s management.

What a season this has been. I've long maintained that _Better Call Saul_ is currently the best show on TV right now, and season 5 as a whole has justified that opinion. Season 5 has somehow become the best season of an already great show, and now with one season left, almost all bets are off. In many ways, season 5 and the finale, "Something Unforgivable", have been about defying expectations. Sure, we have a good idea of what happens to many of the characters on this show – we've seen their fates on _Breaking Bad_. But season 5 has managed to take what we assume is coming and smash it to smithereens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

By the same logic, if it's the government's choice to shut everything down, it should be the government's responsibility to foot the bill for everyone while things are on hold and 'essential' personnel are required to keep working to keep society functioning.

Nebraska Crossing Outlets has clarified the announcement it made last week about reopening on Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The mall along Interstate 80 near Gretna said in an email and Facebook post that Friday is a "soft opening" meant for its retail tenants to start the reopening process, doing things such as sanitizing merchandise, training staff and installing signage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The mall said on its Facebook page that it could be anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks before stores will be open to the public.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "We can appreciate this soft-opening to reopening timeline is fluid and a labor-intensive process for retailers. Take your time," mall owner Rod Yates and marketing director Johanna Boston said in an email to tenants sent Sunday. "Ultimately you the brands will decide when proper operations are in place to reopen to the public and ensure the safety of your staff and customers."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

In his first year as head volleyball coach at Lafayette High, Young inherited a talent-rich group that would go on to make history.

Our Incident Command Team, a group of administrators pre-designated and trained in emergency response, works tirelessly behind the scenes to manage the daily operations of our two campuses. Our Curriculum Committee and Academic Senate quickly reviewed and approved regulation changes needed to allow all classes to be offered in a remote format throughout the remainder of the spring 2020 semester.

Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said Gucci?s sales decline appeared out of line when compared with the 10% drop recorded by the fashion division of rival LVMH, which reported first quarter revenues last week, though Gucci has enjoyed spectacular growth in recent years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

I have not seen my husband in at least three weeks. I made the decision to work, knowing this period of separation could make or break us. He is a serial cheater and maybe this is the kind of separation that I needed to get him out of my system. He has no clue I am collecting video evidence from inside our home, and to make things worse, in our bedroom. He thinks that I am a pushover and my forgiving nature and dislike for divorce will make me stay, but this virus has taught me that life is short. I am no longer going to rob myself of that blessing. When the dust settles, I am making a clean break.

The answer, in short, is that milk doesn’t go straight to grocery stores from dairy farms. First, processing plants turn it into the products you see in your grocery store — cheese, butter, ice cream, and yogurt. Even the milk you drink goes to a plant that pasteurizes, homogenizes, and then fills the paper cartons and plastic jugs you see on the shelf.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Each of these plants specializes in making a certain products, like cheese or milk to drink. Some dairy processors are set up to serve only grocery stores, but some process milk for restaurants and schools. Dairy products made for schools and restaurants can’t be easily sold in grocery stores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  For example, pizza places usually buy cheese that is pre-shredded and packed in 5-pound bags. Milk for schools goes out in half-pint cartons, not the plastic gallons you see in the dairy case. Milk you drink in restaurants is most likely shipped in 5-gallon bags.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  But COVID-19 has basically shut down the markets for schools and restaurants. Meanwhile, more people are showing up at the dairy case. It would cost millions for processors to switch production lines from school and restaurant-type products to retail-sized products. Instead, dairy plants hit by reduced orders for food service products have cut way back or closed down altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

It wasn't bad really and as an added benefit, every once in a while, the sirens would go off in the middle of Father Fusco's sermon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Yeah, I can probably offer you a very Sure. Yeah, I think probably offer you a very crude rule of thumb, just in fairness because I know you guys are trying to get the models right. Obviously LIBOR has been jumping around quite a bit and it gone lower and then went back over a 100, now it's back down again. So depending on how COVID plays out will ultimately dictate the stress on the economy and where LIBOR ends up at. But you could probably apply to that you know about $700,000 a quarter for every resets [Phonetic] of LIBOR. And I would warn you that's a very crude rule of thumb, it depends on when during the month LIBOR might go up or down and resets occur. But just to be transparent, that hopefully gives you a little bit more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

In his convalescence, Boris is said to be anxious to avoid a second peak. Such caution is understandable. Who would want to be the Prime Minister weighing up lives versus jobs, especially when no jobs equals lives lost, just farther down the road? But if  anyone can get the nation to believe it can beat this bloody thing, it’s him. Once the restrictions are eased numbers will creep up again, but with immense vigilance (and abundant supplies of PPE) we can manage. The lockdown was to defend the NHS against a deadly tsunami, now the Government and the country must learn to surf the next wave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

For the first time since going public in 2014, we are reporting a quarterly loss, which totals $4.5 million or $0.18 per diluted share. Our first quarter results were heavily influenced by the implementation of the new Current Expected Credit Loss or CECL accounting standard. CECL requires us to estimate and record an allowance for on and off-balance sheet credit loss, considering expected economic conditions over the remaining contractual term of our portfolio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Until a vaccine is found we are going to have to live with the risk of Covid19 exactly as we live with the risk of road accidents and cancer. Other countries have started to ease lockdown after their number of active cases fell. When we are sure we are at that point, the UK must follow suit. Restrictions must be relaxed on low-risk groups first. The over-seventies and the immuno-compromised may be advised to carry on some measure of self-isolation while the rest of us build up the immunity which hopefully offers them protection. If it were up to me, I’d put the Army in charge of making sure supplies get through to every quarantined person. Along with medics, our soldiers have shown themselves to be among the very best people we have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

After being confronted with the allegations, the Colvins cooperated with investigators and surrendered all their supplies, including approximately 17,000 bottles of hand sanitizer, to a Tennessee nonprofit organization. They also agreed to distribution of a portion of the supplies to officials in Kentucky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

“As legislators, we advocate for our specific districts,” wrote Ellis, who cited facility disparities as one downside of the South triad not having representation on the school board. “Yet, that critical voice advocating for the South triad on the LCSD1 Board of Trustees is sorely missing for these types of issues.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Several community members dialed into the public comment period of the school board’s virtual meeting Monday night to plead with the board to put the policy out for public review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  “The school board sanctioned the three triads for the primary purpose of creating community,” said Carla Gregorio, a retired principal who taught in south Cheyenne and supported the proposal. “We are three communities within the city of Cheyenne. We are not a singular structure.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Gregorio asked the board to release the results of a teacher survey, which she said showed overwhelming support for the proposal.

Trustee Nate Breen, who was one of the loudest opponents of the proposal two weeks ago, said the kind of problems Moyte detailed are cause for concern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  “We need to ask for deep discussions on the board to investigate concerns brought forward tonight,” Breen said. “I’m willing to reconsider this policy, but not without a full vetting. These are very serious charges made against this school board.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Breen said that while he’s “not ready to bury” the idea of redistributing the school board’s seats at this point, he’s also “not ready to put it out for a 45-day pubic review and make a decision by then.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

I believe it vital to remind people not to give up their American freedoms, which were forged in blood. Stay home if you feel you’re a mark for the bug, but not because a mayor told you so … just before she runs off to get a haircut.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Much to my children’s chagrin, watching the CBS program, “60 Minutes” has been a Sunday evening ritual. Many friends confided they stopped watching because the program became so liberal, but I soldiered on anyway. I refer to it as “40 Minutes,” as they now manage to squeeze in 20 minutes of commercials. But, on the occasions they aren’t being overtly political, they do produce some insightful content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The April 12 program was a classic case of their contrasting segments which keeps me watching, but then lamenting irritably about their liberalness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The leading segment dealt with the witless reporter, Bill Whitaker, splitting hairs with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro concerning when “60 Minutes” might have aired episodes warning of this pandemic. Navarro had requested they basically put up or shut up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

"The cartels have the ability to make your life miserable or, alternatively, they have ways in which they can contain the most gruesome violence if the government looks the other way and there's at least an implicit agreement that 'alright, I'll look the other way, but you guys keep it down.'"

Of course, it is true, as noted, that those who are considered service workers would not be able to take advantage of working from home. During this time we are able to see how important these workers are, and, perhaps would decide it best that they receive a higher wage, as they are often at the lowest end of our economic scale, and sometimes must keep up with more than one job just to make ends meet.

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 21st April, 2020) The unity government deal reached by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his centrist opponent, Benny Gantz of the Blue and White alliance, is a plausible compromise for the two in the context of the coronavirus era, but the veto powers of both politicians risk turning the newly-created unity government into a "government of deadlock" after a while, experts have told Sputnik.


  After three rounds of voting and 16 months of the unprecedented political crisis, Netanyahu and Gantz have finally managed to reach common ground in weeks-long talks and signed a unity government deal on Monday.


  Under the deal, Netanyahu will remain the prime minister for 18 more months, while Gantz, the former army chief, will be the defense minister and will subsequently replace Netanyahu for another 18 months.


  COVID-19 CRISIS MADE DIFFERENCE FOR ISRAELI POLITICS


  The deal reached by the two rival politicians is a compromise that helped them avoid responsibility for plunging the country into the fourth round of voting amid the crisis caused by the spread of COVID-19, according to Gideon Rahat, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute and a professor in the Department of Political Science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.


  "There are many different reasons and many different calculations, but at the end of the day the difference between this round and the previous rounds is the coronavirus crisis. So this may be an explanation why they succeeded in doing this," Rahat told Sputnik.


  Dr. Chaim B. Weizmann, a senior research fellow at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, similarly noted in his remarks to Sputnik that both politicians "did not want to be blamed for dragging the country into a fourth election campaign in 18 months," especially during the coronavirus crisis, yet the deal significantly benefited Netanyahu.


  "No doubt, this coalition is a huge win for Netanyahu. He maintains his power and perks, and he will [face] his charges in court as prime minister and it [will] distance him from jail. He dismantled the main � and only � threat to his continuing (very) long governing term," the expert stressed.


  According to the researcher, Gantz, in turn, had poor chances of forming a government on his own after a split within his political camp, which likely prompted him to ultimately reach a deal with Netanyahu.


  "The latest polls predicting his defeat, had Israel gone to fourth election campaign within the coming months," he added.


  While the newly formed government may succeed in addressing the imminent problems in the country, such as the coronavirus emergency, the veto powers of Netanyahu and Gantz risk causing "a total deadlock," Rahat asserted.


  "So, at the beginning such a government may be effective in solving huge problems. After a while, they will start probably to block each other and try to veto each other, thinking whether they can build maybe their own government.

If Japan had a national sport, it would be shopping and, naturally, its capital has the best selection of stores specialising in traditional omiyage (souvenirs)  – think folk toys, kimonos, scrolls, ceramics et al. Keep an eye out too for Tokyo’s 100 yen stores which sell everything under the sun for, as the name suggests, only 100 yen (roughly 70p). And you could easily spend an afternoon wander the lanes of Ameya Yokocho, an old-fashioned open air market filled with vendors peddling spices, seafood and sweatshirts for a snip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

"Unfreezing the economy must go hand in hand with care for the health and safety of Poles... the dates will depend on how the next steps will increase the number of cases," Emilewicz said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

I think the balance sheet growth we did was very -- is going to be very valuable for our investors and us down the road, and we are mindful of our TCE ratio and those ratios, and so we don't ever want to get close to being in a position where we aren't able to play offense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

COVID-19 signage at the employee entrance of JBS USA plant. For weeks, Al Oberloh and others living in this meatpacking town of 10,000 people braced themselves for what they believed was inevitable: an outbreak of the deadly COVID-19. On Friday, their fears were confirmed. At least 19 cases were confirmed at the JBS pork plant here, an hour east of the Smithfield Foods pork plant in Sioux Falls, which was shut down last week when nearly 300 workers were infected with the disease. Now with a foothold in Worthington, a city of 10,000 people, communities across southwestern Minnesota are on edge. "It was just a matter of time," said Oberloh, a City Council member and former mayor. "We're a packinghouse town. We have 2,000 people who work shoulder to shoulder."

The exceptionally clever girls with whom I attended school and university by and large did not. They were busy playing sport and music, passing exams and socialising. Few were interested in competitive trivia. Meanwhile the boys’ school across the road, which attained identical academic grades, regularly fielded five or six strong teams, to our one or two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Meanwhile, _Helstrom_ is set up at Hulu and appears to still be in the works despite other Marvel shows being canceled at the streamer. However, I can't imagine Marvel has plans to make it a big part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That would explain why Zbyszewski's deal is being axed too. The showrunner's history with Marvel goes all the way back to the start of Marvel's _Agents of SHIELD_ , which will also be ending its tenure at Marvel Studios with the upcoming seventh and final season premiering in May.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

That many are currently experiencing pandemic-induced trauma is not surprising. When the very nature of leaving one's home -- for those lucky enough to have a safe place to shelter -- invokes a sense of danger and potential death, it calls to mind not only a post-neutron bomb war scenario in which the buildings survive and something invisible (radiation) presents an omnipotent hazard. It also recalls the nightmare scenario that Rachel Carson wrote about in 1962 when she penned the monumental  _Silent Spring_. Carson's brilliant exposé on the effects of pesticides put forward the nightmarish prospect of no birds singing, a clarion call that sought to ban DDT and other carcinogenic poisons from being liberally sprayed every which way. In 2020, as the cities and towns are largely silent from human self-isolation, the birds who remain are thankfully singing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The RSI index is largely used by traders on a 14.0-day time period and is evaluated on a range from 0.0 to 100.00, along with both high and low volumes marked at 70.00 and 30.00, correspondingly. Both the shorter and longer timeframes are used by the traders for shorter and longer purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

It should go without saying, but since this authorization is categorized as the FDA's first of an at-home test kit option for the coronavirus, this shouldn't be read as a blanket approval for other at-home collection options using cotton swabs or other instruments. Today's announcement is specific to LabCorp's COVID-19 RT-PCR Test for at-home collection of nasal swab specimens using the Pixel by LabCorp home collection kit, which builds on the lab portion of the test that has already been approved -- but it needed health care workers to collect the samples from patients.

BEST LATE-ROUND DRAFT PICK: Bo Jackson. The 1985 Heisman Trophy winner was selected first overall by Tampa Bay in 1986 but ended up playing baseball instead. That didn’t stop the Raiders from using a seventh-round pick on Jackson in 1987. Davis allowed Jackson to play both sports, and the move paid off quickly when Jackson ran for 221 yards and two TDs in his fifth game with the Raiders that season. He played only 38 games over four seasons with the Raiders before a career-ending hip injury in the playoffs following the 1990 season. Jackson is one of four players since the NFL-AFL merger with two TD runs of at least 90 yards.

SmarTrend's candlestick scanner has spotted a possible bearish inside day candle pattern in Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR) based on the price action in the company's shares. Yesterday's price range of $25.63 and $26.35 is within the prior day's high and low of the day. This trading action often signifies indecision by bulls and bears to drive prices higher or lower and often implies a possible change in trend. Owners of Ingersoll-Rand may want to consider a possible hedge in the event a pullback occurs. Look for confirmation in the next few trading days.


  Ingersoll-Rand Public Limited Company manufactures industrial equipment. The Company offers central heaters, air conditioners, electric vehicles, air cleaners, and fluid handling products. Ingersoll-Rand markets its products worldwide.


  Over the past year, Ingersoll-Rand has traded in a range of $17.01 to $146.85 and closed yesterday at $26.43, 55% above that low. In the last five trading sessions, the 50-day moving average (MA) has fallen 10.4% while the 200-day MA has slid 1.4%.


  Potential upside of 289.5% exists for Ingersoll-Rand, based on a current level of $26.43 and analysts' average consensus price target of $102.94. The stock should run into initial resistance at its 50-day moving average (MA) of $59.72 and subsequent resistance at its 200-day MA of $109.30.


  SmarTrend is tracking the current trend status for Ingersoll-Rand and will alert subscribers who have IR in their portfolio or watchlist when shares have changed trend direction.

The entire point of Fireball is to make it easier to play with friends, so having all phones supported is one of their aims. Fireball will also have a subscription model, much like D&D beyond, that will let you expand your library of available tools for GM's and players alike.

“I listened to all of his complaints and even then, I did not want to be in between you both,” she said. “It was painful for me because I loved you both. But once he was killed, you exposed your true self. It broke my heart. He was right all along. Why would you do a Purple Rain boat cruise tour $?$? in 2016? Why would you sell Prince logo tshirts $$$ ? Why did you tell The Revolution April 2016 that YOU knew how Prince died BUT you could not tell them!?! Please get over yourself: YOU ARE NOT PRINCE. You will never be.”

Turns out “60 Minutes” did air a couple episodes. In 2005 and, again, in 2009. I guess we should have written that down somewhere for future reference. CBS pounded their chests while referring back to stories over a decade old, both during and after the heavily edited Navarro segment. This was followed by an obligatory anti-Trump commercial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The second episode was insightful and hit home. They interviewed a 20-something lady taking care of her virus-infected mother at home, while her father laid in anICU unit, also with the virus. In the piece, she lamented not being able to visit her quarantined father. Even this old black heart went out to her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          To me, her plight was startling. If you don’t know me, I’m north of 60, north of in-shape (unless you consider round a shape) and have diabetes. There is a target on my forehead for the virus. This is not me throwing a pity party; I “done got old” and did this to myself out of habit, knowing it ran in the family. It’s a reality of which I’m living with, and there are lots of folks like me. Right now, I’m semi-quarantining myself, but not because some government bureaucrat told me so, it’s because of my situation, and the fact they closed restaurants. I didn’t live to this age to be confined to house arrest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Another thing about me that my children and friends will attest is my deep affection for my wife of nearly 40 years. Friends jest I wouldn’t last 10 minutes without her presence. They’re right, even if she does call me cantankerous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The point I’m making is that poor man was lying in bed dying, more than likely knowing his time was short, yet completely alone. He would die within days of “60 Minutes” filming the segment. What activity or one of life’s little joys had he and his wife been doing just the day before the virus clobbered him? The only person with him at the end was his nurse, certainly an angel, but loved ones were unable to see or touch him before his final journey. Surely, he knew that. What if my wife couldn’t be there with me?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Life is so full of contradictions. I understand people are rationally frightened of catching this virus, virtually a game of Russian Roulette. Folks can get it and never know it, while it kills others indiscriminately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Sitting on my couch that night, I couldn’t fathom a scenario of dying so inexplicably, so alone. The thought was unsettling; a poignant epiphany, of which I admittedly don’t get enough. Godspeed, my friends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

WORST SECOND-ROUND PICK: LB Sergio Kindle. The Ravens’ top pick in 2010, Kindle was taken 43rd overall after a strong career at Texas. Kindle provided a hint of things to come when he fell down two flights of stairs that July. He didn’t play that season, returned to play in two games in 2011 and was cut after participating in one game in 2012. He finished with one tackle.

The atom, the byte, and the gene provide fundamentally new scientific and technological understandings of their respective systems. You cannot explain the behavior of matter--why gold gleams; why hydrogen combusts with oxygen-- without invoking the atomic nature of matter. Nor can you understand the complexities of computing--the nature of algorithms, or the storage or corruption of data--without comprehending the structural anatomy of digitized information. "Alchemy could not become chemistry until its fundamental units were discovered," a nineteenth-century scientist wrote. By the same token, as I argue in this book, it is impossible to understand organismal and cellular biology or evolution--or human pathology, behavior, temperament, illness, race, and identity or fate--without first reckoning with the concept of the gene.

Hamilton cut Saunders before the 2019 season. He was selected by the Houston Roughnecks in the 2020 XFL draft and placed on injured reserve before the start of the season.

Medical Laboratory Professionals Week, April 19-25, has been canceled due to COVID-19. There is no time to honor the unseen professions in the basement laboratory. Laboratorians are an invaluable part of the health care team, with approximately 70 percent of physician diagnosis and treatments relying on our results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The clinical laboratory is constantly being asked to do more with less. Relentless decreases in reimbursement, aging populations (higher testing volumes), and an ongoing critical shortage of staff, make for a challenging environment. Automation and IT solutions can only do so much; you still need skilled laboratory personnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Our politicians point fingers, federal versus state, while comparing Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) molecular technology to an over-the-counter pregnancy test. The misleading public impression that you simply take an instrument out of the box, plug it in and start testing is ridiculous and false. Validation, quality control, regulatory requirements, needed reagents/consumables, training and competency evaluation are just a portion of what is required. The research and development that goes into a new laboratory test event is astounding. Under the current conditions and time frame, downright amazing!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Laboratorians are working diligently to achieve Illinois Gov. Pritzker’s goal of 10,000 COVID-19 tests performed daily. That is in addition to our normal laboratory testing workload. The public deserves accurate test results performed by qualified laboratory professionals in order to deliver excellent patient care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

By the same token, primary care is sometimes seen as an unwanted gatekeeper, a place you have to go before you can get through to the specialist you think you really need.

The company has determined that one (1) isolated TRUE METRIX AIR Blood Glucose Meter was packaged into a TRUE METRIX Blood Glucose Meter kit and has an incorrect factory-set unit of measure; the meter displays glucose results in mmol/L rather than mg/dL. If a consumer does not notice the incorrect unit of measure, it is possible that the meter glucose result will be read as a lower blood glucose result than expected, and this may result in the patient’s glucose level remaining high, which can lead to serious injury or impairment with risk of death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

April 21 (UPI) -- A plan by President Donald Trump to temporarily close off U.S. borders to migrants during the coronavirus crisis has stirred criticism and confusion about how and when it will be implemented.

"I think when you do customer, you have to hold their hand and face to face. You cannot be long distance at six feet far away. So now we still do not have medicine for Coronavirus, so I think it could be like the nail tech or the hair dresser can get the virus, it would be very easy to get the virus. Very easy," said the Columbus-area nail technician.

The coronavirus pandemic means the Town of Smiths Falls will have a little more time to relocate its controversially-placed RV park.
 Parks Canada says the town now has until Sept. 1 to develop a relocation strategy for Victoria Park campground, a seasonal recreational vehicle (RV) park managed by the town's chamber of commerce.
 The federal agency said last year the town is in non-compliance of its lease agreement by allowing the trailer park to operate in Victoria Park - an action they said runs counter to the space's intended use. The express purpose of that original agreement was for the land to be used as "open space parkland," it said in an October letter to council.
 But the COVID-19 pandemic means things have changed, and now evicting the park is no longer an urgent priority.
 "Given the recent outbreak of COVID-19 and the unprecedented national response required to treat and combat the spread of this virus, it is clear that priorities have now significantly changed for all of us," David Britton, the director of Ontario Waterways, said in a recent letter to Smiths Falls council.
 "For the time being, further planning for the campground relocation will need to be (suspended)."
 Parks Canada, which owns the land, evicted the campground from its land last year after declaring it to be a non-compliant use of its property.
 Originally, the town was supposed to be off the land by Dec. 31. Then, after a request from town staff, Parks Canada agreed to a four-month delay until the end of April "given the complexity of the issues" and called it a "one-time exigency."
 The coronavirus pandemic, however, means the town will have at least until September to figure out where to relocate the park.
 The park sits on a portion of land along the Rideau Canal, and has since the Canadian government originally signed a lease agreement with the town in 1897. The town's chamber of commerce, however, has had a management agreement with the town for the last 16 years to operate the RV park.
 Since 2013, Parks Canada has been "systematically reviewing its shoreline land use agreements" to ensure these uses are consistent with its mandate to protect the land around the UNESCO World Heritage destination.
 Removing the trailer park will "open the viewscapes along the canal, encouraging a mix of natural and open green spaces along the water, connecting spaces along the waterfront by pathways and trails, and encouraging the broadest possible public access, use, and enjoyment of the site," Parks Canada says.

Let us pause over _Tender Comrades_ , the oral history of blacklisted Hollywood directors and writers including, for example, Jules Dassin, Ring Lardner, Jr., Martin Ritt, Walter Bernstein, and Maurice Rapf. The subjects of the book with whom I am familiar were blacklisted as a result of their identification as members of the Communist Party and some past or present members were blacklisted for their refusal to name names when subpoenaed in congressional investigations. Some such as Dassin simply took off when the House Un-American Activities Committee came calling. Others are perhaps most notable for their obscurity. I don't know their cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Tokyo has a metro system that Londoners can only dream about. It's clean, runs like clockwork and is good value providing you buy the one day pass (see ‘Save money’ tip below). Buses also criss-cross the city but passengers face slow moving journeys owing to the heavy Tokyo traffic so, if you’re short on time, give them a wide berth. Taxis are an excellent way to get from A to B if your destination isn’t near a station but, unless you’ve got a group of four, they’re expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

I want to say a huge thank you to everyone for their amazing support. It means the world to me!  Now’s the time we need to stand together to fight against film productions that run haphazardly organised sets, aren’t fully insured & leave their injured (or killed) crew members abandoned while they look the other way.  I’m joining the @crewmatter movement to shine a light on these situations so that it never happens to anyone else again.  Whether you’re a film crew member, family of crew or simply love watching films you can join in to show your support by taking a similar picture of yourself & posting it on your social media channels! #crewmatter #peoplebeforeprofits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Jim Justice and the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources’ (DHHR) Office of Drug Control Policy today announced a free smartphone app to reduce isolation and offer support resources to West Virginians with Substance Use Disorder (SUD).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

A Nebraska dam that collapsed under pressure from an icy flood had a history of unaddressed ice issues and had no formal emergency plan because regulators wrongly assumed that no one would die if it failed, according a report released Tuesday.

HINGHAM -- When the schools shut down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the Hingham Community Center also closed its doors and cancelled programs for the foreseeable future. And because dance, art, fitness and educational classes aren't taking place as usual, that doesn't mean costs aren't still piling up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The doors are shut, but the light, heat and water are still on in the historical Ensign John Thaxter House, which means money is going out the door, even when no one is allowed inside, Community Center President Julia Whitney said.

Whitney said just maintaining a historical building is expensive, let alone performing repairs, and the community center still has four employees it is trying to take care of.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The nonprofit is trying to raise money to support itself through the pandemic and whatever comes next, she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "We will get through this storm, we will do that, but I guess it's just getting to the point where, what does the community want? A building where people can rent the space once in a while or a community center that's bustling, with people coming through the doors, with options for each and every person," she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Whitney said she is hopeful for some relief from government assistance programs, but that everything depends on when businesses are allowed to reopen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Community Center doesn't receive funding from the town, so it relies on income from rentals and programs, as well as donations and fundraisers, including an Oktoberfest event, which could be cancelled this year, she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "We haven't even put it on the books yet," she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  A craft beer night was scheduled for May but it cannot be held. The Community Center's largest event, the cabaret, is held in February and should continue next year, Whitney said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  She does not know if summer classes will be cancelled.

An engine failure forced Lazier to drop out of the race after 154 laps, dropping him to 19th.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

"The cartels have the ability to make your life miserable or, alternatively, they have ways in which they can contain the most gruesome violence if the government looks the other way and there's at least an implicit agreement that 'alright, I'll look the other way, but you guys keep it down.'" Payan said. "The question is why would the president himself do it himself? Usually, you send somebody down to talk to the cartels to sort of understand what they want. But why would you put your own reputation, your image on the line?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Kolkata, Apr 21 (PTI) The BJP on Tuesday came down heavily on the West Bengal government for obstructing two central teams from assessing the COVID-19 situation in the state, and accused the Mamata Banerjee-led dispensation of orchestrating a "cover-up exercise" of lockdown violations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The arrival of the teams in West Bengal without prior intimation has already set off a tussle between the Centre and the ruling Trinamool Congress government, as the panel members lay confined to guest houses for most part of the day before the state relented following a stern letter from the Union home secretary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      "It is anyone's guess why @MamataOfficial delayed the #IMCT from their inspection. Sure it must be for some kind of cover up exercise she has orchestrated. Here is the stringent reminder that Centre had to send Mamata didi about things she has forgotten," Union minister Babul Supriyo said in a tweet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said he found it inexplicable as to why only Bengal made a fuss about the teams' visit, whereas other states extended full cooperation in this regard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      "It is not that the central teams visited only Bengal. None of the states have uttered a single word about it... The TMC government has made it a habit to oppose the central government on every issue, even during the time of a crisis," Ghosh said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      "This is not a political battle; it is a matter of life and death of people.

Ad agencies have been absorbing the shock for more than a month now, and a new report from Wall Street research firm MoffettNathanson warns, "This will get bumpy." Analyst Michael Nathanson, delivering 20% to 30% reductions in earnings estimates for Omnicom, WPP and Interpublic, says their flexible business models will enable them to weather the storm. The pain, though, will be more intense than the 2008-09 recession.

"The cartels have the ability to make your life miserable or, alternatively, they have ways in which they can contain the most gruesome violence if the government looks the other way and there's at least an implicit agreement that 'alright, I'll look the other way, but you guys keep it down.'" Payan said. "The question is why would the president himself do it himself? Usually, you send somebody down to talk to the cartels to sort of understand what they want. But why would you put your own reputation, your image on the line?"

Even though his dream city never happened, Walt did get one thing right about EPCOT. If you want to create a new model for something, it really helps to build it from scratch. People, businesses and community institutions rarely embrace change until they see no other choice.

The optimum time to visit Tokyo is between March and April, when the cherry blossom season is in full swing, and September and November when temperatures are pleasant and prices are lower.

“As of 7 p.m. today, I believe we had deaths like over 13 percent, and so our numbers are still going up. Where we’re seeing our numbers really spike are in areas that were slow to close down like Bibb County. It concerns me when you talk about opening up houses of worship, and you know that our worst outbreak in the state came from two funerals, by and large in Albany, Georgia," she stressed.

As the episode progresses, Gene’s story expands to include first his siblings then the supporting cast of local kids, as Bob and Linda enjoy a date night courtesy of the newfound respect Bob found after putting on a fancy suit loaned to him by their mortician neighbor Mort (Andy Kindler). The Molyneuxs recall this B-story as the contribution of writer Kit Boss, later to work on series like _The Tick_ and _iZombie_. (“He's the one that got away,” Wendy says. “We all love Kit Boss. Can this whole interview just be us asking Kit Boss to come back to _Bob 's Burgers_?”) But it’s the relationship between Gene and the toilet that drives the episode. It’s a relationship that partly developed in-person. Though Hamm, having worked under the weather, later had to re-record his lines, he did the initial recording in New York with Mirman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Talking about the game, Sami Khedira was the one who scored the first goal in the first 20 minutes of the match and put the team on 1-0. The score remained same until Alexis Sanchez equalisers in the 70th minute of the game. Three minutes later, Mesut Ozil gave a long-range pass, Ronaldo got in control and proceeded to round Victor Valdes before finishing into the unguarded net from an acute angle. Post this, came the epic celebration by Ronaldo as he silenced the crowd at Camp Nou as the team won the game 2-1. Check out the celebration of the goal.

“What they're doing at the end of the day — which I think is so selfish — they're putting our health care providers, those that are in the trenches trying to save lives every day, they're putting them at risk, and that's wrong. I would ask them to think about that.”

In the 2011 memoir “Reading My Father,” Alexandra Styron described Loomis and her father as a literary odd couple, the author “all untidy appetite and noisy id,” the editor a “sort of Leslie Howard figure, fair hair always meticulously groomed, his voice as gentle as his demeanor.” Literary agent Sterling Lord remembered a more adventurous side to Loomis, who for lunch would fly clients in his private plane from Manhattan to Pennsylvania. Seymour M. Hersh, the prize-winning author and journalist, would describe Loomis as “precise, careful and very direct,” and certain to order a “Jack Daniel’s on the rocks” while only eating “half of his lunch.”

Fines for littering under the legislation would be no less than $200 and no more than $250 for a first offense, and if a subsequent offense occurs within six months of the first offense fines increase to $300 to $500, or imprisonment of up to 15 days.
 Barlow said the city is moving forward with the initiatives despite the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, noting the anti-littering campaign and prohibitions on smoking, vaping and other tobacco products in public places doesn’t put an added burden on the community.
 “Not littering and not smoking in public places is basic decency, common courtesy and simply the right thing to do for other people, for our environment and for our community,” the mayor said.
 Public Works crews Monday were busy erecting signage and trash receptacles throughout the city in advance of the policies going into effect. Barlow said city workers will also double the number of trash receptacles in each city park, and place signage on walkways and playgrounds throughout the city to promote the new policies.
 The ban on Styrofoam included in the initial proposal has been delayed from April 22 to Sept. 8, with Barlow citing the many local restaurants that are relying on take out and delivery orders to stay in business during the pandemic.
 The increased use of take out materials was “sudden and unexpected,” Barlow said, and delaying the ban removes what might be an additional hardship for some small businesses. Hill said the delayed implementation of the Styrofoam ban would help small businesses, particularly restaurants, “during a period of great uncertainty when every dollar is precious.”
 The ban on polystyrene includes single-use or disposable packing, and takes aim at items like coffee cups, take-out boxes, plates and coolers. Barlow said last year, particularly along the city’s shorelines, coffee cups, bait containers and other polystyrene products could be seen disturbing the natural beauty and usage of the area.
 Several exceptions are provided in the polystyrene ban, including use by non- profits or charitable organizations and items packaged outside the city limits that are resold within the city. Officials called the creation of an environmental protection chapter a major step forward for the city.
 “The creation of an environmental protection chapter in the city code is a significant and important step and will give future community leaders an easy avenue to build on the progress we’re making,” Barlow said.
 Asked what might be added to the chapter in the future, Barlow said solar energy policies and LED lighting, along with new definitions and new local programs are examples of the type of proposals that could be added to city code at a later date.

Her fourth-grade son had six English assignments all due at the end of the day.

She could barely keep track of their assignments, four different school email accounts, 12 Google livestreams, and her own worries as she transitioned to a new job while working from home.

Joe Biden is an older, less coherent version of Hillary Clinton, and he seems to enjoy proving it. Like the last Democrat presidential candidate, Biden is an establishment stooge who sneers at ordinary Americans for failing to mimic elitist sensibilities.
 Earlier this week at a fundraiser, this year's presumptive Democrat presidential nominee mocked Trump supporters in a way that reminded some people of Clinton's infamous "basket of deplorables" comment in 2016. In case you forgot, Clinton "joked" that "you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? …The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic -- you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that." Remember that doozy? It was so patronizing that even Saturday Night Live's Seth Meyer, a frequent Trump critic, scolded her for sounding like an out-of-touch "rich, white lady."
 Compare that with Biden's description of Trump supporters this week who "really support the notion that, you know, all Mexicans are rapists and all Muslims are bad and… dividing this nation based on ethnicity, race." Having apparently learned nothing from Clinton's 2016 debacle, Biden seems to think that denigrating millions of Americans as ignorant bigots will earn him plaudits from his far-left backers.
 That may be true, as far as it goes, but demonizing and disrespecting the long-held values of so many Americans is just plain stupid for someone who wants to represent those people as President of the United States. Biden's elitist blunders may be putting him in an even worse position with voters than Clinton was four years ago -- whereas Clinton lost about 12 percent of Bernie Sanders' former supporters to Donald Trump in 2016, Biden is projected to lose 15 percent of Sanders' supporters to the president this time around.
 Like Clinton, Biden, despite spending a lifetime in the nucleus of political power, hasn't the slightest clue what the American people want in a leader. Voters want a leader who puts the interests of American citizens ahead of the interests of foreign governments like China, criminals and shoddy establishment bureaucrats -- exactly the opposite of what Biden has done throughout his nearly five-decade career in politics. Americans want strong borders, a strong working class and a leader who isn't afraid to stand up to America's competitors and rivals. Biden offers none of those things.
 Even today, Clinton and Biden are both pushing the same tired rhetoric about my father being "xenophobic" for (correctly) saying that COVID-19 originated in China. The Democrat establishment still hasn't learned that American citizens on both sides of the political aisle want a leader who will, at the very least, put them before the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.
 By the time 2016 was over, Hillary Clinton had become known as the "most hated woman in America." Biden should really stop trying so hard to emulate her.

Tie all that together, and it seems like the big cats are all the rage these days. But as it turns out, Portland has its own history with tigers and their very own ‘Tiger King’, even if it was only for a brief time.
 “I did have a tiger, but not the one that has COVID-19,” San Patricio County Department of Public Health Medical Director Dr. James Mobley joked. “It was about 1995 or so. There was a guy in Ingleside, and he had three tigers – two adults and a cub who, of course, was named Jasmine. They’re always named Jasmine.”
 Mobley explained that a 9-year-old girl was playing with the cub when she was injured and required 40 stitches. That’s when they called the doctor and asked what they should do.
 “I started looking, and, well, we had absolutely no ordinance that covers tigers,” he said. “So I called Parks and Wildlife, and they didn’t have anything that covers tigers. So I called the Feds, and they didn’t have anything. So eventually they said, you know what, they’re yours.”
 Mobley quarantined them for 14 days to make sure they didn’t have rabies. After that they handed the owner the bill, and he couldn’t pay.

Yeah. I think that's right, Chris. Having said that, I would say that we are in a really uncertain environment, and Jamie and I and a bunch of us were here 12 years ago. And when you get that kind of market dynamics in an uncertain time, it is good to have capital flexibility. So, we've looked at Tier 2 off and on. We'll continue to evaluate it in this environment with a 60-basis-point 10-year low cost taxable capital, it does seem prudent to consider at some point. So, I'm not sure what we're going to do or when we will do something if we do it. But with rates this reasonable, it really doesn't seem to have any downside in an environment like this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Earlier this month, OPEC and its allies, with political pressure from the U.S. government, agreed to cut production by nearly 10 million barrels per day — about 10% of current global output. But some analysts feel the deal didn't go far enough to curb massive oversupply. It kept prices from falling farther for the time being, but there's still too much oil in the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Which brings us back to COVID-19. To say the least, it’s not simple to know whether a specific number of deaths is a success or a failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            If the anchor is 2.2 million deaths from the coronavirus — if that’s what could have happened — then 200,000 might look like a spectacular achievement. After all, two million deaths have been prevented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            If the anchor is 56,000 — the approximate number of Americans who die from the flu each year — then that same 200,000 figure looks really bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            And if the anchor is lower than 56,000 — perhaps the number if the U.S. government had responded promptly and aggressively — then 100,000 deaths is a catastrophic failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The lesson is simple. Don’t be fooled by anchors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            To evaluate Trump’s performance, and that of the U.S. government, we have to ask what, exactly, was done, and what might have been done differently. And if we do that, it’s a pretty good bet that if the United States ends up with over 100,000 deaths, national officials did not do “a very good job.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

"The cartels have the ability to make your life miserable or, alternatively, they have ways in which they can contain the most gruesome violence if the government looks the other way and there's at least an implicit agreement that 'alright, I'll look the other way, but you guys keep it down.'" Payan said. "The question is why would the president himself do it himself? Usually, you send somebody down to talk to the cartels to sort of understand what they want. But why would you put your own reputation, your image on the line?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

In this Tuesday, March 24, 2020, photo released by China's Xinhua News Agency, a worker wearing a face mask drives a forklift at a Swire Coca-Cola Beverages Hubei Limited plant in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province. According to Chinese state media, the plant restarted some production lines on Monday. While many migrant workers across China remain trapped by travel bans due to the coronavirus, some industrial production has returned to action, including in the crucial auto manufacturing industry, which is largely based in Wuhan, and in businesses that provide critical links in global supply chains. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

"This is an opportunity for us to work on our conflict resolution skills and work through built-up resentment and issues that we may not have had a chance to deal with before we were in each others' spaces so much."

The Viroqua School Board voted on Monday to request the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction waive the requirements for the district to meet instructional hours for students for the 2019-2020 school year and waive the requirements to complete an educator effectiveness cycle for educators in their summary year in 2019-2020.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The request for the two waivers was in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a state of emergency and impacted the district through the statewide closure of schools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Prior to the vote, District Administrator Dr. Kehl Arnson said DPI is recognizing the affect school closures are having on districts and their ability to continue the hour-to-hour instruction. He said DPI knows school districts are trying to keep their continuity of learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Shake Shack announced Sunday that it would be returning the $10 million loan it was granted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Only 31.9% of Paycheck Protection Program funding went to businesses whose loans were less than $350,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          “That was the loophole, and it’s a hell of a loophole that these corporations took advantage of,” said JJ Steelman, co-owner of Dad’s Donuts and the Boys Brew.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Dad’s Donuts and the Boys Brew applied for the Paycheck Protection Program to ensure their employees, all of whom are family, were able to make ends meet. They received a call from their credit union Thursday saying that the program funds had been depleted and they would not be getting funding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At that time, Steelman reached out to the community on Facebook, who showed up in hordes to help keep their business afloat. After making enough to bolster their operation, they were notified that they would, in fact, be getting those federal funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Although Steelman didn’t know the logic behind how the funds became available, he said they’ll accept all the help they can get.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Freedom’s Edge Brewing Company was another small business that got funding from the program, which was a much-needed boost, according to Muriah Kilmer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Having to shift their entire business operation to comply with health orders, Freedom’s Edge had to buy a canning machine to be able to sell its beer. Refilling growlers wasn’t an option due to health concerns, so the brewery had to adjust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          “It’s been kind of a lifesaver as far as business goes, but it’s not quite enough,” Kilmer said. “It was really important for us to keep everybody on staff, and this is where the PPP has come in and been a saving grace for us.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          For any local businesses that wanted Paycheck Protection Program funding but weren’t able to get it, Lea from the SBA recommends getting and staying in touch with your banker. You can make sure they have all the information they need for your application in case more funding becomes available.

It was the day the deep water horizon oil rig, owned and operated by offshore-oil-drilling company Transocean and leased by oil company British Petroleum, exploded in the Gulf of Mexico destroying the massive structure, killing 11 crew members on board and setting off the largest marine oil spill in history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

_It began in 63 BI. That is, 63 years Before Immortality, or 2020 AD, as it was known then. Compared to all that came after, the Covid-19 was a relatively harmless virus, but it was the first one to seriously disrupt human life. Countries across the world struggled to rein in its spread and the global economy tanked. While the experience forced many to take stock and reconsider the effects of human activity on Nature, for the majority it became an inconvenient truth to be ignored. No sooner did the danger of the virus pass, than they went back to polluting and exploiting._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Ad agencies have been absorbing the shock for more than a month now, and a new report from Wall Street research firm MoffettNathanson warns, "This will get bumpy." Analyst Michael Nathanson, delivering 20% to 30% reductions in earnings estimates for Omnicom, WPP and Interpublic, says their flexible business models will enable them to weather the storm. The pain, though, will be more intense than the 2008-09 recession.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

CORBIN — “It’s hard to isolate the elders from their families but we’re protecting our most important libraries,” said Nicky Love. “Everyone of them is a different book on the shelf and they just have so much information in them. If we lost even a portion of these people we would lose so much valuable wisdom.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  During Gov.

Our agency has proven that with the right regulations, funding, and partnerships with communities, businesses, and state, local and federal governments, improving air quality and eventually achieving zero emissions is possible. However, we see that not all communities benefit equally. Disadvantaged communities suffer disproportionate adverse impacts such as asthma, and other respiratory illnesses from poor air quality and we see that compounded in light of the COVID-19 crisis.

For those who have an iPhone X, the decision is not as clear cut. It might be hard to justify buying a new phone when you've just paid off the one you purchased a year or two ago. This will depend largely on how you use your phone. If you're a photographer or videographer that really needs that upgraded camera, or if you struggle with storage issues, then the upgrade is probably worth it. Otherwise, you may want to sit tight and think about it a little longer.

Robert A. ("Buzz") Williams passed away on Sunday, April 19 following a short, heroic battle with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) at the age of 65. His wife of 40 years, Ann Hoopes Williams, was at his side. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his brother Jack (wife Jaelene) of Loveland, OH and sister Martha (husband Chuck) Harvey of Hingham, MA as well as 11 nieces and nephews. Born in the Cincinnati suburb of Clifton, OH, Bob attended Sycamore High School and graduated with a BS degree in Business from Ohio University in Athens, OH. He was a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. Bob moved to Pennsylvania when he married Ann in 1979. They lived in Glenmoore, PA for over 20 years and then moved to East Bradford in 2005. They spent many weekends at the family home in Bethany Beach, DE where they initially met as toddlers. They enjoyed boating and nature watching in the Indian River and Rehoboth Bays and more recently, in the Chesapeake Bay region. A self-proclaimed "gear head", Bob also enjoyed cars, especially 1960 and 1970 models. Bob had a successful career as a salesman, business manager and general manager primarily in the transportation industry. He worked at Brooks Armored Car, US Truck Body and most recently at Bentley Truck Services. He will be remembered for his generosity of time, sense of humor and his soft spot for animals of all kinds. There will be a memorial service in the future. Remembrance gifts may be made in his name to The ALS Association, Greater Philadelphia Chapter, 321 Norristown Road, Suite 260, Ambler, PA 19002 or an animal shelter of your choosing.

We will continue to work around the clock to ensure that all King County residents, including those without a home, have a dignified place to be when receiving care for this virus," said Leo Flor, Director of the King County Department of Community and Human Services and Patty Hayes, Director of Public Health - Seattle & King County.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Our partners in the community, collaborating with the faculty, staff, administrators, board of trustees, foundation board and student leaders, are joining together to provide support and minimize the academic and financial hardships of students. Through our COC Foundation, we established the Student Emergency Assistance Fund to help students in the greatest need; and thanks to the support of our generous foundation, we secured $50,000 in matching funds to purchase needed laptops for students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Lazier spent only full-time season on the CART circuit. He finished ninth in the standings that season, was the series top rookie and qualified 13th in his only Indianapolis 500 start. An engine failure forced Lazier to drop out of the race after 154 laps, dropping him to 19th.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

That has hit home particularly hard in Laramie, where education is a major part of our existence. The University of Wyoming is by far our largest employer and our public schools, Laramie County Community College and WyoTech help fuel our concerns for education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There is no doubt that the future of Laramie is tied directly to the future and well-being of UW. That means the impacts of this pandemic on education, particularly on our university, are vitally important to all of us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  UW has responded to the challenge and threat of COVID-19 by closing classes, and converting courses and instruction to an online format. We give their quick response and ability to adapt to this emergency a lot of credit. Everyone from the technical experts to the professors to the administration has worked admirably to lessen the impact on students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  And this emergency conversion to online courses has paid benefits in terms of new skills, advanced techniques and innovative approaches. Those will all be important attributes as we recover from the impacts of this pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  But we must keep in mind that these new and enhanced forms of online teaching are no replacement for the value of a true campus experience. A college education means so much more than simply absorbing facts, figures and theories from a lecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  For many students, coming to a college campus means their first test of real independence and self-reliance. They meet and deal with people much different from themselves. They learn how to interact with people of different races, religions, cultural backgrounds and expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  These are all valuable lessons that really don’t translate into the world of online learning while sitting at home. There are specific activities that require a campus experience, such as labs, practice sessions, performing arts and participation in student government. These are all necessary ingredients of a well-rounded education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Another advantage of a campus experience that students can’t afford to lose is the personal interaction with professors and instructors. That sort of informal mentoring has proven to be invaluable for many students, both undergrads and those pursuing advanced degrees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Asked when the first dose of the vaccine might be delivered to a trial volunteer, chief investigator Professor Andrew Pollard said it depended on when the last part of the testing from the manufacturing ended.                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Dear Dave,                                                                                                                                                                                                   I'm debt-free except for my home, and it is all because I started following your plan four years ago. I'm even on track to pay off my mortgage in eight years. With all the scary economic news out there, I'd love to talk to my family about following your advice, too. Do you have any suggestions for doing this without sounding like a know-it-all or that I am bragging?                                                                                                                                                                                                   Lacey                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Dear Lacey,                                                                                                                                                                                                   It's been my experience that when it comes to family, words don't always do the trick. There's an old saying that goes, "Those convinced against their will are of the same opinion still." Some people have been brainwashed into believing credit cards and debt are an unavoidable part of life. They're stuck in their ways, and nothing anyone can say or do is going to change that.                                                                                                                                                                                                       I've been fortunate enough to help millions of people change their lives, get out of debt and take control of their finances. But there are millions more who will never listen. They'll just keep going deeper and deeper into debt, and never realize the real problem is the person they see in the mirror every morning.                                                                                                                                                                                                   The truth is, you can make irrefutable arguments against credit cards. People who use them spend more than those who use cash or debit cards. Research has proven this. You don't need one to rent a car, get a hotel room, or buy airline tickets. A debit card will do all those things without piling up debt. For an emergency fund, you can simply save up cash. It takes some discipline and hard work, but relying on credit when things go wrong is a really bad idea. It's a trap.                                                                                                                                                                                                   If they won't listen to all these truths, try telling them your story. Let them know you understand from experience how hard breaking old habits can be. Emphasize how amazing your life has been since you decided to actively control your money, instead allowing a lack of money to control you.                                                                                                                                                                                                   Congratulations, Lacey. I'm proud of you for working so hard and being disciplined. I hope you can be an influence on others in your family, and help lead them to a place of financial peace, too!

He offered no details about which immigration programs might be affected by the order, and by Tuesday afternoon, the White House had yet to release any details on its contents or timing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

GARDNER -- The mental health unit at Heywood Healthcare has been closed for the time being and its staff members placed on furlough as the financial effects of the coronavirus outbreak continue to be felt in the local health care system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Heywood Healthcare President and CEO Win Brown said it was a low point in the day when the decision was made to place the mental health unit staff on furlough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "It doesn't seem like it should be this way given the pandemic, and you would think we would have a much stronger behavioral health population needing inpatient care, but that is not the case," said Brown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   He explained that because patient numbers dropped off, Heywood Healthcare closed the adult mental health unit and made the difficult decision to furlough the staff for the month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "It's just a truly unexpected piece of what's happening to us in our region, so I am sorry for the staff that we have had to furlough for the month. Hopefully that volume will return and we will turn the MHU back on," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The news follows the recent announcement that nearly 300 staffers would face temporary furlough or other cost-savings measures as Heywood Healthcare copes with a sharp drop-off in patient volume and subsequent decline in revenue. Heywood also announced this week that it cut five staff positions at the Winchendon Health Center.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Brown said the good news is that Heywood has discharged three of its long-term COVID-19 patients, who all came through the intensive care unit and have done exceptionally well after a very long journey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "We sent them off in Heywood Strong style tonight," said Brown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The patients were escorted in their beds while staff lined the halls from the ICU to their recovery rooms. They were applauded and congratulated all the way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   At Heywood, there are six positive cases in-house. Four patients are under investigation while waiting for test results to return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Brown told his staff that the DoubleTree Hilton in Leominster is a place health care workers are invited to stay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

This photo taken April 18, 2020, shows the JBS USA Pork Plant in Worthington, Minn. For weeks, Al Oberloh and others living in this meatpacking town of 10,000 people braced themselves for what they believed was inevitable: an outbreak of the deadly COVID-19. On Friday, their fears were confirmed. At least 19 cases were confirmed at the JBS pork plant here, an hour east of the Smithfield Foods pork plant in Sioux Falls, which was shut down last week when nearly 300 workers were infected with the disease. Now with a foothold in Worthington, a city of 10,000 people, communities across southwestern Minnesota are on edge. "It was just a matter of time," said Oberloh, a City Council member and former mayor. "We're a packinghouse town. We have 2,000 people who work shoulder to shoulder."

Dat is haast onmogelijk, gezien het risico. Veel bedrijven zullen daarom misschien juist meer gestimuleerd moeten worden om _out of the box_ te denken, wat betreft hun gehele organisatie (inclusief bedrijfsproces). Maar zoveel tijd en energie stoppen in zo'n complete _overhaul_ kan alleen als het een aantrekkelijke investering lijkt. Dan moet er financieel gesteund worden én moet het alternatief (niets doen) duurder/erger zijn.

Talking about the game, Sami Khedira was the one who scored the first goal in the first 20 minutes of the match and put the team on 1-0. The score remained same until Alexis Sanchez equalisers in the 70th minute of the game. Three minutes later, Mesut Ozil gave a long-range pass, Ronaldo got in control and proceeded to round Victor Valdes before finishing into the unguarded net from an acute angle. Post this, came the epic celebration by Ronaldo as he silenced the crowd at Camp Nou as the team won the game 2-1.

We'll do the right things for the customers and we'll see where demand for homes goes over the next year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Yeah, absolutely. And so, as we look at the second deferral, it's really about the time in the individual's situation. What I mean by that is, the longer that the current shelter-in-place lockout continues, the more likely that we're going to -- it's going to be necessary for us to grant additional 90 days on a more systematic or more global perspective. But then, we'll also dive into the individual situations as businesses will take a little bit longer. Certain business will take a little bit longer to revamp or get back up to normal, it's about pacing. And so, one of the key things we did on the front end was have our customer outreach program so we can kind of get a lens. This first 90 days, we'll kind of -- we'll monitor and see how it flows. The second 90 days is going to be a little bit more deal specific in so much that we'll start to craft and tailor credit products and/or relief to their individual needs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

As revenue has plummeted and assets have declined in value, some companies are saying they may be unable to repay.


  Whiting Petroleum Corp became the first major producer to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 1. Others, including Chesapeake Energy Corp, Denbury Resources Inc and Callon Petroleum Co, have hired debt advisers.


  Oil prices have crashed as demand has shrunk due to lockdowns and economic slowdowns during the coronavirus pandemic. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, recently announced sweeping cuts in production, amounting to almost 10per cent of global supplies. Demand has dropped as much as 30per cent.


  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said leading global oil producers could hold talks again to discuss their output deal further if needed.


  Trump has separately announce plans to fill up the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, something that would take around 77 million barrels off the market - or less than a day of typical global demand.


  Congress so far has declined to provide the funding due to opposition from Democrats who oppose aiding the oil industry when laid-off workers and other sectors also need help.


  Brouillette said on Tuesday he would meet with lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives to renew the administration call for funds to buy oil.


  In the meantime, the Department of Energy is in talks with oil companies to lease some of the available space.


  Trump has also repeatedly threatened to use tariffs to block crude oil imports to help domestic drillers - but the U.S. energy industry's main trade associations have opposed the move, saying it would only raise costs for the refining sector.

Due to the Port City’s status as a waterfront community, Barlow said the city has “even more responsibility” and “more of an obligation” to protect the environment, adding it’s important to enact policies that encourage individuals to be respectful of the environment and the investments made in public spaces.
 The three initial articles in the chapter deal with Styrofoam, or polystyrene, containers, littering and smoking in city facilities and public spaces. Officials lauded the policies as protections for public health and the environment, and said the creation of an environmental protection chapter in the city code opened the door for future safeguards.
 “This is a huge step for not only the current residents, but future residents — the children and grandchildren — who will benefit from this,” Council President Rob Corradino, R-7th Ward, said in October, adding each of the three measures would help improve residents’ quality of life.
 According to city documents, littering is defined as throwing, depositing or placing garbage (putrescible animal and vegetable waste), refuse or rubbish (non-putrescible solid waste consisting of both combustable and non- combustible waste) in or upon any street, road, sidewalk or other public place within the city of Oswego, except in public or private receptacle.
 Council Vice President Kevin Hill, R-3rd Ward, said the creation of an environmental protection chapter in the city code codifies a commitment to preserving and protecting the community’s resources for future generations.
 “As a waterfront community, we have an obligation to take a firm stance on issues that threaten the very essence of what makes our community special,” Hill said. “This new chapter provides the framework for both bold and incremental changes as our city leaders face environmental challenges both now and in the future.”
 Smoking and all other tobacco use of any kind will be banned on all city property, including parks and public spaces, and a fine is established for violations, according to city officials. Vaping and other forms of nicotine or tobacco use, including smokeless tobacco, are included in the ban.
 Lighting up or packing a dip in restricted areas will carry a fine of no less than $100 for the first offense and climbs to $250 or up to 15 days imprisonment upon a third offense.

The thing is, when you work on a "fee-for-service" model, when people go straight into secondary care and doctors are reimbursed for everything they do (rather than being salaried), there's no-one to put balance and checks into what is done to people. Therefore, a lack of a fundamental primary care system can lead to a lack of co-ordination, unnecessary care and unwarranted expenditure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

I’m also seeing clients with psychological vulnerabilities. Instead of hearing, “60 is the new 40,” I’m hearing “40 is the new 60” because those 60 and older are considered at a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus. Clients are talking about feeling their older age in ways they haven’t before.


  Being in closed quarters around the clock can bring out the worst in us. This is when unresolved childhood issues start to surface. It can be something as small as when you were grounded and not allowed to leave the house.


  Members of the LGBTQ community are vulnerable to mental health issues at this time. Studies show these individuals are more likely than the general population to have compromised immune systems (eg, higher rates of asthma, self-medicating with drugs or alcohol, cigarette smoking). Only 17 percent of this group has insurance. For them, the pandemic is particularly dangerous and stressful, and they may not seek counseling services when they are most needed.


  During this challenging time, look at the world through a new set of eyes. We may begin to see an opportunity to better ourselves. Start moving out of fear and into growth, move toward living in the present and focusing on the future, have empathy and kindness for others, and learn to adapt to change in a mentally healthy way.


  Psychotherapy can help. Many mental health therapists now offer telehealth sessions for clients. They will meet through webcam or telephone for one-on- one confidential therapy sessions.


  Just as you would call your medical provider when you are sick, it is just as important to seek counseling when you are experiencing feelings such as depression, anger and anxiety that you can’t seem to manage on your own.


  If you feel overwhelmed and unable to achieve your goals on your own, you may want to seek professional help.

While the novel won't hit bookshelves worldwide until May 19, Lionsgate is already moving ahead with the film, which will be directed by Francis Lawrence, who returns to the director's chair after helming _Hunger Games_ films _Catching Fire_ , _Mockingjay Part 1_ , and _Mockingjay Part 2_.

This means investment, like never before, into a transportation system that gets people out of their cars and using public transit, while we electrify our vehicles.

She could barely keep track of their assignments, four different school email accounts, 12 Google livestreams, and her own worries as she transitioned to a new job while working from home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The _Hunger Games_ movie prequel has been in the works at Lionsgate for nearly a year, before the details on Collins' unpublished novel had even been revealed. But _The Hunger Games_ series has been a big moneymaker for Lionsgate, which has been seeking a new mega-franchise to rival the $3 billion worldwide property ever since. It got close with the unexpected R-rated success of the _John Wick_ films, but there hasn't been a massive YA franchise quite like _The Hunger Games_ wrapped up in 2015. And Collins likely couldn't resist a guaranteed movie deal with Lionsgate, despite no one really asking for a President Snow prequel that doesn't star Donald Sutherland. But perhaps an anti-hero movie about a rich, white man's rise to tyranny will be all the rage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

MUMBAI -- Tennis great Billie Jean King says the financial fallout from the coronavirus shutdown has exposed the unfairness of the sport and that it is important for the top players to lead the cause for change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The tennis season was suspended in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown will continue at least until mid-July, depriving lower-level players, who depend solely on tournament winnings, of the chance to earn a living.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The sport's governing bodies have joined forces to devise plans to provide relief and 12-times Grand Slam singles champion King said the sport had the chance to emerge stronger from the health crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "This is a good time to reset and to have one voice in the sport, which we really never had. We need that desperately," King told the Tennis Channel. "I hope they will all work together more after the COVID-19 situation calms down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Maybe some day, and I didn't think it is possible, we might have a Commissioner. I don't know. We are not the biggest sport in the world, we don't have as much money as say soccer. So we need to stick together and everyone needs to help each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "The thing that's also good is it shows the inequities that go on. So this is a good time to reset and think about how we want our sport to look in the future. What can we do to make it better, stronger and more secure?

The men's ATP, the WTA, which runs the women's circuit, the world governing body International Tennis Federation and the organizers of the four Grand Slams have come together to work on creating an emergency relief fund.

King said the WTA was also working on ways to provide financial relief for its players.

Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday said that the state government has suspended rapid antibody tests for the next two days in view of the advisory issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). "In view of the advisory issued by ICMR, the state government has suspended Rapid Anti Body tests, for next two days," Sarma tweeted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Earlier, he had tweeted, "From April 22, we shall begin Rapid Antibody tests, from Spanish Garden - a containment zone. Government of India has given 9,600 Rapid Antibody test kits for IgM/IgG to coronavirus. The test is non-confirmatory yet useful for mass surveillance in containment areas as it gives results in 15 mnts." The ICMR on Tuesday advised the states to stop using COVID-19 rapid testing kits for the time being owing to big variations in their results and said that it would issue an advisory in this regard in the next two days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    During a press briefing in Delhi, ICMR head scientist Dr R Gangakhedkar said, "The states have been advised to not use the COVID-19 rapid testing kits for two days. A lot of variations are being reported in the results of rapid test kits. The kits will be tested and validated by on-ground teams and we will give advisory in the next two days." Gangakhedkar said the step has been taken after receiving a complaint from a state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "The rapid test kits have been distributed to states. Yesterday, we got a complaint from a state that these kits' results are not satisfactory. Today, we asked three more states and got to know that positive samples are showing a lot of variation -- from 6 per cent to 71 per cent. This is not a good thing," he said. "We cannot ignore these findings. We have decided to send members from our eight institutes to the field in the next two days. The kits will be tested and validated by on-ground teams and we will give advisory in the next two days," he further said.

Prendendo come riferimento la forchetta dell'ultima settimana, il rallentamento del virus sembra una realta, ma in modo piu lento rispetto a tutte le altre province. _                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

When it comes to performance, the iPhone 11 Pro has all the bells and whistles, but it's not a huge departure from the iPhone X. The iPhone 11 Pro has an A13 Bionic processor and 4GB of RAM, as opposed to an A11 and 3GB RAM in the iPhone X. While this makes for slightly faster processing times and graphics that are better by a smidge, the difference is not all that noticeable. Comparing to an older iPhone 8 or 7, on the other hand, the iPhone 11 Pro is worlds ahead when it comes to graphics and speed.

Was he trying to make himself feel good? Attacking others in his case what is called "virtue signaling.” It is also disgusting behavior and insulting to boot.


  Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Parker lost a very young daughter to a crazed, gun- carrying, revengeful person. Why does he insist on blaming President Trump and those who voted for him for that misfortune? Who is morally and intellectually bankrupt in this case?


  Fate did not leave them a chance to hold their daughter’s hand and say good- bye before she left this earth to go to a better place called heaven. For this we can sympathize with them.


  My wife and mother of our only child, too, lost a young daughter, a first- year, second-semester medical student, at the age of 23 to an unknown virus. Talk about pain, hurting, wondering, anger, yet still know death has no dominion.


  Fate allowed me to hold my daughter’s hand as she took her last breath. The doctor present at the time took off his gloves and angrily asked, “Why is it that the good die young?”

Across the nation, thousands and thousands of students were expected to graduate, achieve educational milestones, matriculate to different levels of education and matriculate to different institutions this year. Summer 2020 was about to be lit with graduations, parties, festivities, beach runs and road trips….and now just like that gathering with more than ten friends is wildly unsafe and can get you in a lot of legal trouble. And just like that exams are postponed or up in the air and even asking about graduation plans is taboo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange
