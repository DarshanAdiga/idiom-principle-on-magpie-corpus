There are other states angling to get cannabis on the ballot, as well. For example, residents in Nebraska and Missouri are currently gathering signatures for measures that would legalize medical pot in Nebraska and recreational weed in Missouri. Arizona, a state that narrowly voted down adult-use marijuana in 2016, also looks to be a serious contender to legalize recreational marijuana in 2020.

I can say with a relatively high degree of certainty that states like South Dakota and Mississippi aren't exactly on the radars of large-scale cannabis stocks. Even if these states were to give the green light to cannabis, the peak sales potential may not be enough to encourage MSOs to buy their way in.

The act, to say the least, is untoward, illegal and totally condemnable. No one, no matter how highly placed, is allowed to unlawfully enter a public school premises and demolish buildings under whatever guise without approval from Government. We see this as an act of provocation and lawlessness and as a government; we will not sit down and watch some lawless individuals have their ways in sabotaging government by destroying school properties or embarking on renovations of public property using lawless means simply for political showmanship”.

My memories were like dominoes. One memory would trigger another. The smell of the bread started the memory train. Suddenly my brain was full of treasured moments that weren’t in my brain five minutes before.
 That is how our brain works. There are all kinds of memories in there. They are just on the back burner where we don’t think about them, but one smell brought them all rushing back!
 You too can hop on your own memory train. I highly recommend it. Your own thoughts and joys from the past can be a blessing to you on a blah January day.
 So, go dig out the family photo album. Go searching for Grandma’s favorite recipe or call your mom and ask her about when she was a little girl and take her on the memory train. She will love it!
 Our memories never go away. They are neatly tucked in the recesses of our mind. Take them out and dust them off and enjoy remembering what was.

OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reviving his practice of holding periodic cabinet retreats outside the nation's capital -- an exercise in regional outreach that his office maintains is worth the added cost of ferrying ministers around the country.
 Beginning Sunday, he and his 36 ministers will be holed up in Winnipeg for three days to discuss priorities and plot how to bring them to fruition in a House of Commons where the Liberals hold only a minority of seats.
 That is to be followed by a three-day caucus retreat with Liberal MPs in Ottawa, in preparation for the resumption of Parliament on Jan. 27 -- its first extended sitting since the Liberals were reduced to a minority in the October election.
 The choice of Winnipeg is a nod to the East-West divide exposed in the election. The Liberals shut out entirely in Alberta and Saskatchewan, where voters were irate over environmental policies they believe have gutted the energy industry.
 Manitoba, where the Liberals lost three of six seats, is somewhat friendlier territory. The province's premier, Brian Pallister, has signalled a willingness to try to bridge the divide between the federal government and his fellow conservative Prairie premiers.
 Trudeau is to meet separately with Pallister while he's in town, as well as with Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman.
 "Canadians sent us a clear message that they want a government that finds common ground and supports everyone is different regions," the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement when asked why the retreat is being held outside Ottawa and in Winnipeg in particular.
 "We are also committed to listening to and working closely with Canadians in the Prairies to address their specific concerns."
 During his first mandate, Trudeau held eight cabinet retreats outside Ottawa, including two in Alberta.
 Conservative MP Candice Bergen, who represents a Manitoba riding, dismissed the Winnipeg retreat as a show of listening to westerners without actually changing any of the "failed policies," like the federal carbon tax, that Prairie voters rejected.
 "If this is to be a sincere effort, the Trudeau Liberals should meet directly with Manitobans to understand how their policies are making life more difficult," she said in a statement.
 Among the issues ministers are expected to discuss during the Winnipeg retreat is what the government calls "the challenges of an uncertain world" -- a timely topic as the country tries to come to grips with Iran's admission that it accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet last week. The crash killed all 176 people on board, including 57 Canadian citizens and 29 permanent residents.
 The retreat will focus primarily on more prosaic matters: the state of the economy, the upcoming budget and how to deliver on campaign promises to bolster the middle class, fight climate change, strengthen gun control and achieve reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.
 And there'll be a session on how to get it done in a minority Parliament.
 On helping the middle class, ministers will get some expert advice from economists Armine Yalnizyan and Kevin Milligan and Canada's chief statistician, Anil Arora.
 On climate change, they'll hear from economist Andrew Leach and climate scientist Katherine Hayhoe, the duo who last fall graded the major parties' campaign plans to cut carbon emissions. (They gave the Liberals a B for ambition and an A for feasibility).
 Of particular interest to the West, they'll also get an update on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Bill Downe, the chair of Trans Mountain Corp. and former CEO of BMO Financial Group, and Linda Coady, a former Enbridge executive who heads a committee advising the government on consultations with Indigenous communities that want a financial stake in the project.
 The Trudeau government bought the pipeline for $4.5 billion after Kinder Morgan decided to scrap plans to twin the pipeline due to political uncertainty and legal hurdles. The government cleared one of those hurdles Thursday when the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that British Columbia cannot regulate what flows through the pipeline, which is to carry diluted bitumen from Alberta's oil sands to the B.C. coast for export overseas.
 Starting Wednesday, Trudeau and his minister will hole up again for three days in Ottawa with Liberal MPs.
 Caucus chair Francis Scarpaleggia noted in an interview that this will be the "first real working session" of caucus since the election.
 Since most Liberal MPs have never experienced a minority Parliament before, he expects the retreat will focus heavily on the challenges that will bring, with insights shared from veterans like himself who've been there before.

The other state where marijuana is guaranteed to appear on the ballot is South Dakota, another one of the 17 states where medical marijuana is currently illegal. South Dakota will be making history as the first state to have a medical pot measure and adult-use weed measure on the ballot for vote, although these are two separate measures. Ohio had tinkered with the idea of trying to legalize both medical and recreational pot at the same time a few years ago, but a ballot measure never came to fruition.

I have always been ambivalent about the monarchy.
 On one hand, it's an outdated vestige of a long since failed empire, but on the other we made treaty with the Crown and our rights are embodied in the commitment made in Queen Victoria's name.
 If we didn't have the monarchy and the subsequent honour of the Crown, our treaties would have been reduced to meaningless rhetoric long ago, much like the Americans' treaties south of the medicine line.
 Our relationship with the Crown goes back a long way. In 1763, King George the Third issued the Royal Proclamation which outlined how the North American colonies would be governed. The proclamation placed the Crown in the position of dealing with the various nations of Indians that were within the colonies' land base. This principle is still in place and all our treaties have been made in the name of the Crown.
 Now we have our treaties entrenched in the constitution, and in the future, they will be further strengthened by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the honour of the Crown will still apply.
 The honour of the Crown is the principle that when a treaty or any arrangement is made in the name of the Crown, it must be honourable and not place the sovereign in disrepute. Therefore, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the treaties must be interpreted fairly and where ambiguity exists it must be in the favour of the First Nations.
 Which brings us to the state of the current monarchy. Back in George the Third's day, the monarchy had much more control over the affairs of state compared to the current monarchy, which is largely symbolic. However, today's monarchy is much better organized and is deeply embedded in British life.
 While the monarchy should be out of date and largely obsolete, British royalty has few important functions. Today's monarchy is little more than a group of mediocre people with few accomplishments other than military service, horseback riding and the ability to serve in a figurehead role.
 Which brings us to Prince Harry. Harry had watched his mother pursued by the press and hounded relentlessly. His wife Meghan is now the object of the same public humiliation, only in her case, racism plays a major role.
 The British tabloids have been relentless in their pursuit of her. Because her mother came from Los Angeles, the Daily Mail's headline in November 2016 read, "Harry's girl is (almost) Straight Outta Compton." The fact that she is biracial seems to be a fact that some racist British media just can't handle.
 While other royals would get a pass, every issue about Meghan was noted; a BBC reporter even made the remark that her baby looked like a chimpanzee. Fortunately, he lost his job, but that is the nature of the racist undercurrent. They want out, and I don't blame them.
 I have been to Britain several times and I have been shocked at the level of racism. Most Brits still think that Britannia still rules the waves and the sun has yet to set on the British Empire. They call us Red Indians and think we still live in teepees or igloos.
 When Harry moves to Canada, he won't be some impoverished waif travelling steerage on a tramp steamer. He has an inheritance from his mother and the Queen Mother of some $46 million Canadian, plus he is entitled to a piece of his father's profit from the Duchy of Cornwall and the Royal allowance that is doled out by the Queen.
 Meghan Markle also has an estimated net worth of around $5 million.
 So, they are not exactly strapped for cash. Harry would be just another remittance man sent out to live in the colonies.
 The couple's move to Canada could turn out to be a positive move. Canadians are by and large polite and give each other their space. We don't have a culture of celebrity as the U.S., nor do we have a gutter press that preys on the royals as does Britain.
 So, I encourage them to come to multicultural Canada and let the sun continue to set on Britain and its long dead empire.

My present wasn’t wrapped in shiny paper with bows on top. Oh, no! It was in a shiny bread pan wrapped in a kitchen towel.
 The moment she set it down on the table, my mind transcended immediately back to our kitchen when my mom opened the oven and brought out her famous, mouth- watering, scrumptious light rye bread.
 Jeanie had stolen Mom’s recipe from my keepsake file. In that shiny bread pan was my mom’s bread. “Merry Christmas!” she said as she plopped it down on the table.
 The aroma only got better when she sliced the loaf open. I couldn’t wait for her to spread the real butter on that first slice.
 The room was silent as we both enjoyed a moment from the past. I can’t tell you how many slices of Mom’s bread I have eaten. It was a treat.
 It seemed natural to share the bread, just like my mom used to do. Jeanie and I buttered the piping hot bread and handed out the pieces to anyone and everyone at Linden Court. (If you missed it, we’ll do it again.)

But then Christmas was about to continue. A whole cartful of memories was wheeled in. A long-forgotten box of scrapbooks and yearbooks and photos was part two of this late Christmas celebration.
 So, book by book, page by page, as we enjoyed another slice of bread, we traveled down memory lane. From Cody Elementary School to college graduation, my head and heart were filled with memories. I remembered things I hadn’t thought of in years.
 I remembered my mom in the kitchen with her apron on, kneading the bread and putting it in a big crock to rise. She always put a dishtowel over the top of the bread. When it came out of the oven, she buttered the top with the butter wrapper.
