The toll rose to 20 on Wednesday in the municipality of Chiconcuautla in the central state of Puebla on Wednesday, a day after it declared a health emergency following 17 deaths from consuming tainted beverages. The local government said it had confiscated 200 liters (352 pints) of a local alcohol known as "refino" and was conducting studies to determine its contents.


  In Yucatan, where local media reported a wave of deaths from the drinking of adulterated alcohol, the state government in April restricted alcohol sales to prevent domestic violence as more people stay home during the pandemic.


  Federal health regulator COFEPRIS said last week it was investigating the sale of adulterated alcohol.


  In its earnings call last month, Mexican conglomerate Femsa , which owns the popular Oxxo convenience store chain, said it had about 10 days' worth of inventory of beer.
