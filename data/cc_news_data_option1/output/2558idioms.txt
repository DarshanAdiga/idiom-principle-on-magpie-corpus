Palace appointed their former player on a three-and-a-half-year deal after agreeing compensation with Newcastle, with chairman Steve Parish wanting a boss with a great track record and proven experience in the Premier League. Pardew took over from Neil Warnock and led the club from the relegation zone to 10th that season – the club's highest Premier League finish. He guided Palace to the 2016 FA Cup final, when he became a social-media hit with his dancing on the touchline after Jason Puncheon's opener before Manchester United hit back to win 2-1 in extra-time. Pardew was sacked in December 2016 with Palace 17th in the top-flight following a dismal run of form that calendar year.

This isn't the first time the Madden franchise has tried its hand at a more narrative-based story mode. Madden 18 and 19's Longshot mode sought out to tell an emotional story centered on an up and coming superstar. However, Face of the Franchise looks to up the ante. The story will no longer stop once players reach the NFL. In fact, the post on EA's website lists 8 potential storylines that a player may experience through their journey in the pros.

Mitchell County residents will soon have a place where they can learn about the county’s rich history. The Cedar Valley Seminary Foundation purchased the former Press News building back in March 2019, and it is currently in the process of turning it into the Leeman Education Center.                            The center is named after Osage native Gerald "Germ" Leeman, who won a silver medal in wrestling during the 1948 Summer Olympics. In a previous Press News article, Joyce Ruehlow, president of the Cedar Valley Seminary Foundation Board, said Leeman always gave credit to his hometown for his success.                            In the same article, she went on to say that Leeman said he was lucky to be raised in a town that took care of him.

We have to go way back to start unraveling root problems right now.

                            A vacancy created by the resignation of the president of the board of the Sunrise Beach Fire Protection District, will mean the two remaining members will be appointing the third member.                                                         According to information provided by the district, the board met in an emergency session late last week to accept the resignation of Brian Laymen, who had been serving as president of the fire district. The district was notified of the resignation on June 18. Layman cited his moving out of the District as the reason for his resignation. The resignation was effective immediately.                                                          The board held an emergency meeting on June 24 to formally accept the resignation. The next meeting will be July 20.                                                                                                                    At the July meeting the Board will discuss how to proceed with filling the vacant seat. Under RsMO 321.200.2 - Any vacancy on the board shall be filled by the remaining elected members of the board, except when less than two elected members remain on the board any vacancy shall be filled by the circuit court of the county in which all or a majority of the district lies. The appointee or appointees shall act until the next biennial election at which a director or directors are elected to serve the remainder of the unexpired term. The remaining board members, Dill and Bob Hemen, will select a member of the community to fill the vacant seat until the April 2022 election.

Layman's seat would have been up in the April 2024 election, however due to his resignation, the district will be required to hold an election for the seat in April 2022 and that election will be for two years to complete the term. In April of 2024, that seat will revert back to a six-year term.                                                                                        "

Newton was cut by the Carolina Panthers in March, and many thought he would sign with the Patriots right away. And while he only signed a one-year deal worth $7.5 million, Newton has a chance to make significant Patriots history. According to STATS, if Newton becomes the Patriots starting QB, he will be the team's first starting QB who wasn't drafted by the team since Scott Secules in 1993. The Patriots have already made history by adding Newton, becoming the first team in league history to lose a former MVP in free agency and gain a former MVP in the same offseason, according to Elias Sports.                                    Losing Brady to another team wasn't something Patriots fans were anticipating. But is the team better off having a 31-year old Newton over a Brady, who will turn 43 at the start of the season? Chris Simms of NBC Sports told the _New York Post_ adding Newton to the Patriots makes a ton of sense based on their personnel.                                    "I honestly think the way the team is built right now fits more to Cam Newton football than it does to Tom Brady football," Simms said. "That's just tailor-made for Cam, and now you have the ability to do more creative things within the running game. Now you have one of the greatest play-action offenses in football." Newton had a successful career with the Panthers, winning Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2011 and winning the MVP award in 2015, the same season the Panthers reached the Super Bowl.

Tsepkalo, a former ambassador to the United States and a founder of a successful high-technology park, submitted 160,000 signatures on petitions to get on the ballot for the Aug. 9 election, but the commission said only 75,000 were valid less than the 100,000 needed. less

Prosecutors said the deal ensured that aging survivors and victims’ relatives lived to see the case resolved, sparing them further legal proceedings likely to have dragged on for 10 years.                            The hearing was held in a Sacramento university ballroom, rather than a courthouse, to allow for socially distanced seating amid the coronavirus pandemic. The defendant and his attorneys wore medical-style, clear plastic face shields.                            DeAngelo, dressed in orange jail garb, sat expressionless and slack-jawed in a wheelchair throughout the seven-hour proceeding.                            He spoke in a weak, raspy voice only to give yes and no answers to procedural questions from the judge, and later to answer “guilty” when Bowman asked his plea to each of 13 counts of first-degree murder and kidnapping.                            He also replied “I admit” to dozens of allegations of rape, robbery, and other crimes as prosecutors took turns presenting “factual-basis” statements graphically detailing every murder, sexual assault and burglary with which DeAngelo was accused. His admissions encompassed a total of 161 uncharged crimes, prosecutors said.                            DeAngelo’s arrest in 2018 capped more than 40 years of investigation that authorities finally solved through DNA evidence and data from commercial genealogy websites.                            The breakthrough came about two months after the case gained renewed national attention in the bestselling book, “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark.” A TV documentary series spawned by the book premiered by coincidence on HBO on Sunday.                            Besides the 13 murders and kidnappings, prosecutors said DeAngelo was tied to nearly 50 rapes and more than 120 home invasions — mostly in and around Sacramento, the eastern San Francisco Bay area and Southern California.

The first ferry of record in the region was established in 1840 by Thomas Carey. It was located at the west end of present- day Northwest 63rd street in Grove, now Carey Bay, and was created as the result of traffic from northwest Arkansas. The ferry crossed the Grand River to a trading post called "Tightwad," near Echo Bay. If the river was low, travelers could by-pass the ferry and cross through the water. Carey's Ferry was utilized until replaced by a bridge in 1905. Another ferry opened in the region when the Military Road was extended from Baxter Springs to Fort Gibson in 1843, service was initiated to cross the Neosho River five miles south of Miami.

These calculations are absurd. As the Oxford philosopher Jonathan Cohen explained ‘The advancement of truth in the long run is not necessarily the same thing as the dispensation of justice in each individual case. It bears hard on an individual…if he has to lose his own particular suit in order to maintain a stochastic probability for the system as a whole.’ US legal scholar Laurence Tribe makes a similar point. ‘Tolerating a system in which perhaps one innocent man in a hundred is erroneously convicted despite each jury’s attempt to make as few mistakes as possible is vastly different from instructing a jury to aim at a 1% rate of mistaken convictions.’

Of course, some will argue that it is playing our anthem at so many gatherings that differentiates America from the rest of the world and that it is another example of American exceptionalism. America fought the revolutionary war and fought Britain again in 1812, and I believe the flag – but not the anthem – profoundly symbolizes the rights and freedoms that were hard won but often taken for granted, including the right to be united and the right to dissent. However, if we want to treat the anthem with the same deep respect that we show the flag, then we should not play it on every conceivable occasion. By doing so, we actually cheapen and hollow the message that the lyrics are meant to convey.

Chandigarh Delhi is the topmost city across the country responsible for the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in neighbouring Haryana, particularly in the national capital region (NCR) districts of the state. Back and forth movement of a large section of population between Haryana's NCR districts and the national capital for professional and personal reasons is the cause behind the spread of disease, officials said. State-wise travel history data and source of infection statistics show that 431 individuals who tested positive for coronavirus in Haryana had contracted the disease in Delhi. In comparison, 89 people found infected in the state had sourced the contagion from Maharashtra, 51 from Uttar Pradesh and 15 from Gujarat. The transmission of virus from the national capital had also forced the state government to restrict the interstate movement between Haryana and Delhi. Health department officials said the information about the antecedents and travel history of the Delhi patients was established after questioning them. "The primary and secondary contacts of the infected individuals in Haryana were traced, tested and quarantined. It is a big number in terms of contagion spreaders who infected multiple persons in the state. Then it becomes a chain of infection," said a health official. Officials said there were several contagion spreaders having the national capital links, which could not be identified due to various reasons. "Many Delhi residents who have extended families or relatives in Haryana got themselves tested in the state. They couldn't be counted as Delhi residents because they furnished local addresses. Then there were Delhi-based patients who got tested at private labs in Haryana and furnished incorrect addresses," said an official monitoring the NCR situation. In fact, many Delhi private labs which had tested samples of such floating populations failed to communicate the results to the state authorities. Health officials said that a number of vegetable traders, commission agents and workforce detected positive in Jhajjar and Sonepat had also carried the virus from Delhi.Positivity rate higher in NCR districtsWhile Haryana's ten districts have a sample positivity rate of less than 2%, a desirable value as per the parameters of the Union ministry of health, the three NCR districts of Faridabad, Gurugram and Sonepat accounting for more than 68% of the active cases have more than 6% positivity rate, a critical value as per the health ministry parameters. Faridabad has a positivity rate of 15.6%, followed by Gurugram (13.4%) and Sonepat (6.6%). Bhiwani with a sample positivity rate of 5.9% and Rewari at 5.8% are on the verge of breaching the 6% mark.Contact-tracing algorithmThe state health officials have put into effect an elaborate contact-tracing algorithm for the infected individuals. Once an individual is suspected of carrying the infection, the process starts with testing the suspect, tracking his travel history and movement, identifying his high and low-risk contacts, testing and putting them under quarantine and further investigating the primary and secondary contacts of these high and low-risk contacts.

NEW ORLEANS -- Kathryn Conyers is not a baker, but she tried. And she failed. When she sought advice from her friend Carla Briggs, a trained pastry chef, Conyers was too embarrassed to send photos of the lackluster loaves. In the end, Briggs decided that she needed to come over and bake the bread herself.                                                                        A month later, as the coronavirus pandemic ramped up, the friends saw shelves in New Orleans barren of bread and thought, 'maybe baking bread could be a business.' Soon after that, Viola's Heritage Breads was born.                                                                        "Viola just sounds nice and homey, like somebody's grandmother that maybe would have a recipe that exists today but didn't really get the recognition," Conyers said.                                                                        Conyers and Briggs said they didn't see many Black-owned bakeries and wanted to bring a business to New Orleans that celebrates both Black entrepreneurship and heritage. The recipes draw on their roots, using local Southern ingredients like Louisiana sweet potatoes.                                                                        The breads, which the pair deliver themselves around New Orleans or ship nationwide, are generous sandwich loaves like whole wheat brioche, sweet potato rosemary and white einkorn wheat. They're about goodness, not being gourmet. The fanciest thing that Viola's sells are tea cakes.                                                                        "This is an untapped market of providing quality sandwich bread," Briggs said. "So, we jumped right in and it has been fun."                                                                        Conyers and Briggs have a larger mission: they want to celebrate the too often overlooked Black cooks and chefs in the South.                                                                        "I've worked at Emeril's and I've worked at the Ritz Carlton," said Briggs of her time cooking in New Orleans, "and the people making the stocks and things that make these chefs great are mostly African Americans. They are creating the basis of this food, but their names aren't on it."                                                                        For now, Viola's Heritage Breads is run from Brigg's kitchen. Louisiana's cottage food law allows businesses with less than $20,000 in sales to operate from a home with some limitations. The two still have their day jobs. Conyers, who has degrees in finance and law, works for a New Orleans non-profit organization that builds playgrounds around the country. Briggs, who left restaurant work due to a carpal tunnel syndrome, founded Eat Your Words, which teaches literacy through food.                                                                        Though the start is small, the women have big aspirations for Viola's.                                                                        "It's not something that's a hustle. Can it grow and live on to be a staple?" Conyers said. "Can we build wealth and knowledge that could be passed on generationally?"                                                                        Briggs wants Viola's to create better opportunities for New Orleans restaurant workers.                                                                        "I've been trained with the best people ever," said Briggs, who graduated from the prestigious culinary school at Johnson & Wales University, "but it's hard to get a job here and get respected and get paid for the knowledge and experience that I have in food."                                                                        One day, they hope that Viola's breads, baked in New Orleans, will be sold in grocery stores across the nation.                                                                        "What does it look like to have a bread or item that reflects me? That reflects us. That I see on the shelf that's not necessarily like Aunt Jemima," Conyers said.

WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), on a call with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar, urged HHS to address COVID-19 relief funding shortfalls at safety net hospitals, including children's hospitals, in Illinois.  Durbin discussed how the latest round of $10 billion in Provider Relief Fund missed some of the most prominent safety net hospitals in Illinois, and how many are urging for more assistance in order to stay financially viable during the pandemic. Durbin urged Azar to use the remaining $62 billion in the Provider Relief Fund to fix the payments for these safety net hospitals--which serve low-income and vulnerable patient populations, and are on the front lines of addressing widespread racial disparities that have been magnified by this pandemic.
   
 "As the country continues to grapple with increasing cases of COVID-19, our hospitals remain on the frontlines of the battle against this virus.  They've had to adjust operations drastically in order to take care of a surge of patients, while also cancelling many other procedures, and that means many are struggling to make ends meet. I urged Secretary Azar to expand our testing capacity and rectify flaws in its funding formulas to ensure our heroic health workers can continue serving their communities."
   
 To date, Congress has appropriated a total of $175 billion to assist hospitals with the coronavirus pandemic, with Illinois hospitals receiving $4 billion so far.
   
 Durbin and Azar also discussed Operation Warp Speed, and how the United States is progressing in developing vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Durbin urged Azar to not abandon global efforts on vaccine research and development.

WORCESTER - George's Coney Island did the unthinkable. It opened on a Tuesday.
 While the city's premiere hot dog joint is known for being closed on Tuesdays, it has, in fact, been open the Tuesday before a big holiday in the past, more often when the Rev. Solon S. Tsandikos ran the place. Now it's run by his daughter, Kathryn T. Tsandikos.
 "It's not that unusual. We've always done it before a holiday if we were going to be closed," Mrs. Tsandikos said. "My father always did it before Christmas, Thanksgiving and Easter. Whenever we were closed on a holiday, he would stay open on the Tuesday before."
 However, Mrs. Tsandikos said she is not sure if Coney Island was ever open on the Tuesday before the Fourth of July. Heaven knows you can't get more American than a consuming a tasty hot dog to mark our country's independence.
 "We've always done it," Mrs. Tsandikos said. "For maybe three or four Tuesdays a year we would be open."
 Proudly declaring that it was "breaking all the rules," George's Coney Island was open for a four-hour window on Tuesday, for curbside pickup only.
 To be perfectly frank, Mrs. Tsandikos seemed more thrilled with the announcement that they will be selling the family's "secret" chili sauce (in 8-ounce containers) and classic sides of macaroni salad, German potato salad, baked beans and coleslaw, all homemade, in quart containers on Wednesday and Thursday.
 Wearing a "George's Coney Island closed tuesdays" T-shirt, Rachel Pressey patiently waited in the rain for two dogs with chili and onions, while her boyfriend, Pat Clancey, waited for two with mustard, ketchup and onions. Both are from Worcester.
 "We're here because they're open on Tuesday," Pressey said. "They're the best hot dogs."
 Ryan Kelley of Worcester said he lives closer to Hot Dog Annie's in Leicester but prefers Coney Island.
 "We always want it on Tuesday," Clancey added. "You've got to take advantage of it."
 "I was brewing beer and browsing Instagram and saw that they were open," Kelley said. "I was like, well, I know what I'm having for lunch today."
 Rich and Mary Shea made a special trip for hot dogs from Auburn.
 "We haven't been here in a while, so we figured why wait," Mr. Shea said.
 Dave McMahon, who lives in Westboro and works at Dismas House in Worcester, knew George's Coney Island isn't normally open on Tuesdays but he saw it in the newspaper that they were this particular Tuesday and made it a luncheon engagement for himself.
 "It's just great to be able to get out of the office," McMahon said. "These guys have been around so long. They have such a good product. So it's great to support it."
 George's Coney Island will be closed from Friday through Wednesday because of the Independence Day holiday. Then it will look into outdoor dining and a possible start to indoor dining, Mrs. Tsandikos said.

“Since its introduction to the world, the Prius has been a disruptor in the traditional combustion sector,” Esteban said. “And, it has influenced and challenged other automotive manufacturers to follow suit. The Prius will continue to help influence and lead the way for other alternative fuel vehicles. My personal Prius will remain in our family. There is no other vehicle that can replace it.”                                                                                                                                                 Along the way, the Prius became a cultural icon. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Leonardo DiCaprio drove them – as did Al Gore’s son, who famously hit 100 mph on a L.A. freeway. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Paul Ingrassia included the Prius in his book “Engines of Change” alongside the Ford Model T, Chevrolet Corvette and Pontiac GTO. It even had a starring role in a 2006 episode of South Park where citizens got so high on their Prius-fueled environmentalism that they created a “smug cloud”.                                                                                                                                                 By 2011, the smug was wearing off as competitors like the Ford Escape Hybrid, Chevy Volt, Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S arrived. Prius sales hit a record high of 147,500 in the U.S. during 2012, but declined to under 50,000 in 2019 (excluding Prius v/c) while Toyota’s overall hybrid sales increased 28.7%.                                                                                                                                                 The Prius may have challenges, but there are now hybrid versions of the Camry, Avalon, Highlander, RAV4 and Corolla. Lexus offers electrified UX, NX, and RX crossovers plus the ES and LS sedans. The company’s most expensive hybrid is the exotic $97,510 LC500h coupe. Going further, the all-new 2021 Sienna minivan and Venza crossover will come hybrid only.

In grade school I encountered the bone-dry confections known as Fig Newtons and immediately determined my loathing for what I thought were figs. Little did I know fresh figs are some of summer’s most delicious bounty and can be used in everything from desserts to savory entrees and delicious appetizers.
 The dark oblong-shaped fruits bear the essence of a dark plum or cherry but with a slight citrus element pinging the sides of your cheeks with each bite. The challenge I find is that you see incredible combinations of flavor and preparations from TV networks, celebrity chefs, and all over the internet but in the Quad-Cities I have yet to find them at the store. It was on the off- chance I made a trip to Trader Joe’s in Iowa City and saw on the shelf a container of fresh black mission figs, needless to say, I was overjoyed.

 WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), on a call with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar, urged HHS to address COVID-19 relief funding shortfalls at safety net hospitals, including children's hospitals, in Illinois. Durbin discussed how the latest round of $10 billion in Provider Relief Fund missed some of the most prominent safety net hospitals in Illinois, and how many are urging for more assistance in order to stay financially viable during the pandemic. Durbin urged Azar to use the remaining $62 billion in the Provider Relief Fund to fix the payments for these safety net hospitals--which serve low-income and vulnerable patient populations, and are on the front lines of addressing widespread racial disparities that have been magnified by this pandemic.
 \"As the country continues to grapple with increasing cases of COVID-19, our hospitals remain on the frontlines of the battle against this virus. They've had to adjust operations drastically in order to take care of a surge of patients, while also cancelling many other procedures, and that means many are struggling to make ends meet. I urged Secretary Azar to expand our testing capacity and rectify flaws in its funding formulas to ensure our heroic health workers can continue serving their communities.\"
 To date, Congress has appropriated a total of $175 billion to assist hospitals with the coronavirus pandemic, with Illinois hospitals receiving $4 billion so far.
 Durbin and Azar also discussed Operation Warp Speed, and how the United States is progressing in developing vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Durbin urged Azar to not abandon global efforts on vaccine research and development.
