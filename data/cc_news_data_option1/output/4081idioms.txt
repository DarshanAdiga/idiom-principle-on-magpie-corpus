Gretchen Whitmer knew she'd have the spotlight Thursday. And she decided not to waste it.
 Hours after the FBI revealed a group of anti-government vigilantes had plotted to kidnap her, the Democratic governor of Michigan addressed her state — and the nation — with a message that didn't mince words about whom she blamed for the threat: President Donald Trump was complicit for "giving comfort to those who spread fear and hatred and division."
 It was a familiar move for a governor who has repeatedly engaged in heated public battles with the president that may only hurt him in a pivotal state against Democrat Joe Biden. While she risked politicizing the moment, the governor said Friday that she didn't think twice about calling out the president.

If you've followed the Plymouth North sports scene over the last decade you are no doubt familiar with the Walsh family.
 Matt got the ball rolling as a bruising running back in the football program and the starting catcher on Blue Eagle state championship baseball teams in 2008 and 2011.
 Casey followed right behind and found success with the girls soccer and softball programs. Meghan came next and enjoyed great times with the girls soccer and basketball teams that earned her the Old Colony Memorial's Plymouth North Female Athlete of the Year award in 2013.
 "I'm still friends with a lot of the girls I played with back then," Meghan said. "It's been a while now, but when we get together it feels like it was just yesterday when we were all playing sports together."
 Not to be outdone, Joe, the youngest of the Walsh siblings, won the Massachusetts Gatorade Baseball Player of the Year in 2015.
 That's a lot of athletic success in a short period of time for those four athletes. Their parents, Tim and Tracy Walsh, did all they could to be there to see all of it.
 "It was tough sometimes trying to be everywhere and see everything, but I wouldn't change that time of my life for anything," said Tim. "It seemed like every weekend we were running here or there to get the kids to their games. Sometimes Tracy and I had to split up to do it, but it was absolutely worth it to us. We always wanted to be there to support our kids in whatever they were doing at the time."
 His wife agrees.
 "It was a lot to do, especially when the kids were younger, but we always found a way to make it work," Tracy said. "Tim and I were always on the phone with each other on those crazy weekends catching up on how the kids were doing. It was a little crazy sometimes, but I wouldn't change those times for anything in the world."
 Matt said his parent's efforts to always support their kids did not go unnoticed.
 "I knew it then but I understand it even more now that I'm little older. There is no way I would have been able to do all I was able to do in sports without the support of my parents," Matt said. "They sacrificed so much of their own time over the years getting all of us to where we needed to be."
 Dwayne Follette has been around Tim and Tracy longer than most. Tracy is his first cousin and Dwayne's been close friends with Tim since he moved to town as a youngster.
 "Tim and Tracy are really amazing with how much they've done for their own kids as well as the children of Plymouth over the years. They've spent a huge amount of time coaching teams and working with the youth leagues," Follette said. "They're both great people who've given so much to the town."
 Tim and Tracy each understand the value of what high school sports from personal experiences.
 Tracy, a kindergarten teacher at the West Elementary School, was a volleyball star at Braintree High and in college at the University of Maine-Farmington and then Southeastern Massachusetts University.
 Tim played basketball, baseball and football at Plymouth-Carver before moving on to play football at Central Connecticut University. A three-year starting quarterback at P-C, Tim is a member of the Plymouth Athletic Hall of Fame.
 "Those were some fun times," Tim said. "I'll always have great memories of the Thanksgiving football games and opening day for baseball while playing sports with some of my best friends. I grew up with guys like Steve Tavernelli and Dwayne (Follette) and we had so many great times playing high school sports together."
 "Tim was an incredible athlete. He played three sports and was good at all of them," said Dwayne. "He could throw a football 60 yards with ease, he was the starting center fielder and a pitcher for the baseball team, and he was the first guy off the bench with the basketball team."
 Tim got to re-live some of those great days when Matt came up to the Plymouth North baseball team as the starting catcher and big hitter on the undefeated state championship team in 2008.
 Matt was back for another state title run to glory in 2011 before moving on to play four years at Franklin Pierce. He eventually was signed by the New York Yankees and played a year of professional baseball before hanging up his catching gear for good. He joined his father in the Plymouth Athletic Hall of Fame when he was inducted with the Class of 2018.
 He now works with young baseball players with big league dreams of their own as part of J&M Baseball Academy with business partner Joe Flynn.
 "I'm enjoying it. I like coaching kids and helping them get the most from of their baseball skills," Matt said. "The game gave me so much and I like having the opportunity to give some of it back."
 Casey and Matt both work for their father in the family business, Walsh Steel and Ironworks. Meghan is a nurse at Beth Israel Deaconess-Plymouth. Joe is a graduate student at Boston College. He still has two years of athletic eligibility remaining and is coming off a great summer season with the Brockton Rox where he was named the Relief Pitcher of the Year for the Futures Collegiate Baseball League.
 Each week during 2020, the 50-for-50 project will profile a Plymouth person or state championship team that positively impacted the town in the last 50 years. To nominate someone, email Sports Editor David Wolcott Jr. at dwolcott@wickedlocal.com with information on the nominee.

WICHITA, Kan. (Wichita State Athletics) – The Black Team earned a 10-3 victory over the Yellow Team in game one of the Wichita State Baseball Black and Yellow Fall World Series Saturday, Oct. 10, at Eck Stadium, Home of Tyler Field.  Jack Sigrist pounded out three hits and drove in a pair of RBI, while Corrigan Bartlett belted a three-run home run, leading the Black Team at the plate. Paxton Wallace and Seth Stroh each posted two hits, with Wallace also tallying a double, respectively.  Reliever Aaron Bechtel (1-0) earned the victory on the mound after throwing one inning and allowing an earned run on two hits.   Sigrist put the Black Team in front, 1-0, after hitting single to left field to bring in Andrew Stewart in the bottom of the second inning. Yellow took a brief, 2-1, advantage with a pair of runs in the third. Jalon Mack scored the opening run of the frame on a sacrifice fly off the bat of Cooper Elliot, prior to Garrett Kocis smashing an RBI triple down the right field line for the go-ahead run.  Black came charging back in the bottom-half of the inning, plating four runs, jumping out to a 5-2 advantage on a Noah Greise two-run single and Cooper Harris two-RBI double.  After Yellow trimmed the lead to 5-3 with a run in the top of the sixth, Black responded with four more runs in the bottom of the inning, highlighted by a three-run homer to left-center from Bartlett, ballooning the score to 9-3.  Couper Cornblum went 2-for-4 with a double, pacing Yellow in the batter's box, while Mack added a ground-rule double.  Game two, which is closed to the public, is slated for Monday, Oct. 12.

On Saturday, Urvashi Dholakia shared a post that she had tested positive with Covid-19 and is now Covid free. The actor called the 25 days she was "out of action", a tough period and that she didn't want to speak about it till she was well.
 "I am a private person, so I didn't want to announce that I had tested positive. But now that I am fine, I felt the need to tell my well-wishers the same and also address their queries about being off the grid for so long," she says.


 Dholakia revealed that alongwith fluctuating blood pressure, she had headaches, which is when she got tested though she didn't have other symptoms. "I rarely stepped out of my house and yet I got it. Coronavirus is like flu and it's best to get tested at the beginning than when it gets worse. I had a cold, on and off, for a while too. Everyone shows different symptoms and most of them don't disappear quickly. I got worried when I lost the sense of smell and taste and couldn't eat properly," she shares.
 The actor was in isolation at home, got good rest and took medications as recommended by the doctors. Another blow for her was when her mum tested positive, too. "It was scary for me as I was worried about my mum who had flu and had body ache. She is 84, so it was tough but I am glad that it's over," she says.
 Apart from physical symptoms, Dholakia admits that her concern about her mum took a toll on her mentally. She had to be strong mentally so that she could arrange for care for her mother. "In the initial days, when it is all new and you are unwell, you start thinking about how some people recover faster and others don't. We have heard of cases when things turned out really bad for some. I would say, if you test positive, keep a positive attitude, take medicines and ample rest," she signs off.

 # TupaTalk: Forging ahead through the challenging days
 Mike Tupa
 Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise
 During a brief phone conversation Thursday night with one the genuinely nice and talented young football coaches of our area, the observation was made that life isn't fair sometimes.
 No, it isn't — sometimes.
 I'm kind of reminded of the joke where someone is struggling to unscrew and tight lid on a container and can't get it to budge. Someone else standing nearby tries and gets it off on the first try, prompting the first person to say, "Well, I loosened it."
 It seems at times others get the bigger benefit for the good we do, or we pay the consequences for the bad someone else does.
 But, when I think about life as a playing field and fate as the referee, I'm reminded how fickle the application of destiny can be.
 I know a young man in California who, at the age of 15, became paralyzed from a severe spinal injury during a wrestling match. That was nearly 27 years ago and he's been in a wheelchair since.
 I know of some pretty precious people in this area that have passed — many in their teens and some in their prime, some in their early middle-age or non- retirement stages of life and others older.
 These were all good people, the younger ones brimming with potential for worthwhile lives or having already carved out positive legacies in our community.
 But, yet, they are gone, leaving only good examples and broken hearts tempered by happy memories.
 Life sometimes isn't fair. We have to deal with it.
 When sports were cancelled last spring, the pricetag became high for many throughout the nation. In the case of this area, I believe there were some depending on having a strong spring season in order to attract college scholarship offers — a springboard to the rest of their lives.
 But, that opportunity was denied them and their paths to a higher education became infinitely more difficult and expensive, perhaps prohibitive.
 I wonder, parenthetically, if they would have rather risked the extremely low chance of getting a virus in which they likely would have recovered from in two or three days, rather than to see their whole futures clouded. Just a thought.
 Life sometimes isn't fair. Or kind.
 I once had to drive 600 miles one way in an 18-year-old car — at my own expense — to interview for a newspaper job, and then turned around and drove back all night so I would only miss one day of work.
 I didn't get the job. But, I didn't give up.
 I would hope that when someone complains about being sore or dealing with some type of nagging physical ailment, that they think on the young man from California that I mentioned.
 Even if walking is painful, it is preferable to not being able to walk alone, or having to depend on people to care for every bodily need.
 My mom related many times to my sister and I an analogy of a dump yard somewhere where everyone could unload their problems in a pile and have to pick someone else's.
 She said that if we could walk around this heap of human woes and witness the heartbreaking troubles with which some people have to live with, we'd gladly pull our own problems back off the stack and go home with them.
 These ideas aren't meant to minimize the wrenching challenges — whether they be in the area of health, finances, legal, emotional, grief, or something else, or a combination of these things — with which many people have to deal.
 That's why those who enjoy good jobs, strong family situations, good educations, healthy families and decent health should fill their hearts with gratitude and a charitable spirit.
 Whenever a pro athlete complains about being unappreciated, or being underpaid for his services, or being disrespected, or things like that, I get a little hot.
 Most big league athletes are among the healthiest, richest people in the world and they have access to every state of the art medical treatment available, as well as fame and incredible pension plans on top of the hundreds and thousands or millions they made in salaries. Many also received the opportunity for free Grade-A educations.
 I'm not say those are the things that make people happy — but they are tremendous blessings for which gratitude is in order, including to the soldiers who have preserved a culture of liberty where individual and collective prosperity can exist.
 I believe there are three bottom lines — first) none of us should stand in judgment of someone else going through brutally tough times, it could be us; second) there are usually things for which to be grateful during tough times and they can soften the hardships; and, three) we can try to help ease someone else's burden, whether it be a smile and a handshake, whether it be some acts of service or whether it be, when appropriate and possible, some material help, if even just a meal.

All legislative powers enjoyed by the rest of the provinces can be extended to the G-B Assembly by amending Article 142 and the Fourth Schedule. Membership to constitutional bodies like the National Economic Council, the National Finance Commission and other bodies was to be by “special invite”, meaning not full membership. The recommendations fall short of the aspirations of G-B’s people. First, the number of seats in the National Assembly must at least be five, and the number of Senate members should be equal to all the other provinces. The membership to constitutional bodies must be constitutionally mandatory, especially the two most important of those, the National Economic Council and the National Finance Commission that decide development projects and division of resources between the federating units. Keeping G-B out of them will make any elevation of status toothless because it will be denied its share of financial and development resources.

The Covid-19 vaccines closest to the finish line are designed to be injected into the arm. Researchers are looking at whether they can get better protection from inoculations that fight the virus at its point of attack -- the nose and mouth.
 Most vaccines in human testing require two shots for effectiveness, and developers still aren't even sure if they'll prevent infections. Scientists are hoping to generate superior immune responses with inhaled vaccines that directly target the airway cells the virus invades.
 An alternative to conventional jabs, sprayed and inhaled immunizations under development in the U.S., Britain and Hong Kong could play an important role in helping society escape restrictions that have upended economies and everyday life. Among their goals is to prevent the pathogen from growing in the nose, a point from which it can spread to the rest of the body, and to other people.
 "Local immunity matters," said Frances Lund, a University of Alabama at Birmingham immunologist working with biotech Altimmune Inc. on an early-stage nasal inoculation. "The vaccines that can be delivered to generate that will have some advantages over vaccines that are delivered systemically."
   
   
 Most early vaccine developers focused on a familiar route -- injections -- seen as the fastest to protecting the world from disease. Inhaled vaccine makers are counting on some of the unique features of the lungs, nose and throat, which are lined with mucosa. This tissue contains high levels of immune proteins, called IgA, that give better protection against respiratory viruses.
 Activating these immune weapons, they theorize, can protect areas deeper in the lungs where the SARS-CoV-2 does the most damage. They also may improve vaccines' chances of blocking transmission.
 "The first generation of vaccines are probably going to protect a lot of people," said Michael Diamond, an infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. "But I think it's the second- and third-generation vaccines -- and maybe intranasal vaccines will be a key component of this -- that ultimately are going to be necessary. Otherwise, we'll continue to have community transmission."
 In a study of mice in August, Diamond and his team found that delivering an experimental vaccine via the nose created a strong immune response throughout the body; the approach was especially effective in the nose and respiratory tract, preventing infection from taking hold. India's Bharat Biotech and St. Louis-based Precision Virologics last month obtained rights to the single-dose technology.
 Vaccines that are sprayed into the nose or inhaled may hold other practical benefits. They don't require needles, may not need to be stored and shipped at low temperatures and can reduce the need for health workers to administer them.
 "When you're thinking about trying to deliver that across the world, if you don't need to have an injectable vaccine, your compliance goes up because people don't like getting shots," according to Lund, the Alabama-based researcher. "But secondly, the level of expertise needed to administer that vaccine is significantly different."

 Altimmune, based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, plans to enter human testing with a nasal vaccine in the fourth quarter after positive studies in mice. Scientists at the University of Oxford, where a promising shot under development at AstraZeneca Plc was designed, and Imperial College London are also planning studies of slightly different inhaled vaccines.
 The experimental immunizations in Britain would be delivered through a mouthpiece in an aerosol, similar to some asthma therapies. Imperial researchers point to evidence that delivering influenza vaccines via a nasal spray can protect people against illness and help reduce transmission; they're keen to explore if that's also the case for SARS-CoV-2. AstraZeneca makes the FluMist nasal spray vaccine.
 Data from studies of the inhaled Oxford vaccine could come early in the new year, followed by Imperial results in the second quarter, according to Robin Shattock, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College.
 "We don't know whether it will work well, but if it does, then it could be very important," he said in an interview.
 Imperial College in recent months has been advancing studies of a Covid vaccine using RNA technology that would be delivered via conventional shots and plans to expand its trials to 20,000 people by year-end. Oxford, one of the front-runners in the global quest for an inoculation, is in the final stage of tests for a shot that uses a harmless virus to carry the genetic material of the pathogen into cells to generate an immune response. Both techniques may be conducive to inhalation, Shattock said.
 "This is a virus that's transmitted through your respiratory tract, so if you want a vaccine that will really prevent infection and onward transmission you want to have an antibody response in your nose, in your lungs," Shattock said. "The most efficient way to induce that is by inoculating through that route."
 Researchers in Hong Kong are aiming for an intranasal vaccine that would simultaneously offer influenza and Covid-19 protection. The first phase of human tests will start next month, said Yuen Kwok-Yung, chair of infectious diseases in the University of Hong Kong's department of microbiology.
 The ambition is to come up with the "vaccine of choice," as the world looks to build on the first wave of products, he said.
 Questions about the durability of nasal vaccines have yet to be resolved, and they're at an early stage. Despite the advantages, the delivery devices are also more complex, according to Nick Jackson, head of programs and technology at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
 "A needle and syringe work very well," he said.
 Still, researchers said targeting the airways may pay off down the road. Oslo- based CEPI has provided funding to the Hong Kong project and is open to further investments in vaccines that are taking unconventional approaches as part of an effort to supply billions of doses to every corner of the world, Jackson said.
 "Whether it's our vaccine or another one that goes through an intransasal route that actually is successful at disrupting transmission and disrupting the pandemic, I take my hat off," Diamond said. "If we contribute by compelling or nudging these companies to think about an alternative route for what may be a successful platform, then we've done our job."

Former Boston Bruin      Bobby "Bo" Miller passed away at 64 years young on Wednesday September 30, 2020 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, FL, leaving his family and friends with heavy hearts.      Bobby was one of four siblings raised in Billerica, MA where he spent a significant portion of his childhood in the hockey rink. He was offered a full scholarship to UNH where he still holds the record for most points scored in a season. Bobby's years playing professional hockey took him throughout the US and Europe. At only 19 years old he was a member of the 1976 US Olympic Hockey team at Innsbruck, before going on to play for the Boston Bruins, Colorado Rockies, and the LA Kings, as well as for Finnish and Swiss hockey teams.      While hockey was a big part of his life, that is not what defined him. He had an incredibly sharp wit and was quick to laugh. He was an avid gardener and connoisseur of lawn maintenance. Many a friendship was forged upon a shared love of music and live shows. He loved to go fishing on Martha's Vineyard where he spent summers with his family and friends, engaging in one form of debauchery or another. He enjoyed golfing with his sons and lovingly destroying his daughter in a friendly game of Cribbage. He had an affinity for his dogs which were always poorly trained. He loved his children, whose training was only slightly better, with all his heart.      Bobby is survived by his children Meghan, Shawn, and Jake, and his siblings Mary Ellen Crosby and Paul Miller. The Miller clan is incredibly grateful to his companion, Juliana Apollonia, who cared for him in his last few weeks. He is predeceased by his parents, Robert Miller and Katherine O'Meara Miller, and his sister Maureen.      Upon his death, his children donated his brain and spinal cord tissue to BU's CTE Center, a research center investigating the long-term impacts of repetitive brain trauma in athletes.            It was Bobby's wish to have his final resting place be between the Cape and Martha's Vineyard as he never felt more at peace than when he was at sea. This will take place at a future date, when loved ones can gather safely. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to BU's CTE Center. We also kindly ask that you listen to "Moonlight Mile" by the Rolling Stones and remember him. It was one of his favorites.            View the online memorial for Bobby Miller

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities, which had initiated a penalty for parking vehicles within the radius of one kilometre (km) of the civic body's Public Parking Lots (PPLs) in July last year on the grounds of encroachment, are set to withdraw the fine.
 The BMC is in the process of entrusting the responsibility of levying the fine to the Mumbai Traffic Police (MTP) and also towing away of vehicles that are found parked illegally. MTP will tow away the vehicles that have been declared as scrap and are found parked by a roadside.
 Initially, the fine amount was fixed at Rs 10,000, later it was brought down to Rs 4,000, which would remain unchanged, BMC officials said.

 Praveen Pardeshi, the former commissioner of BMC, had justified a year ago that the civic authorities would tow away vehicles that are found parked illegally. The BMC authorities had introduced the fine in a bid to reduce congestion on Mumbai's roads and also promote the use of Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses.
   
   
 However, the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation has also led to an acute staff crunch. "We are overburdened with work for the past seven months because of Covid-19. We have taken the decision to hand over the responsibility of slapping fines on errant vehicles to Mumbai Traffic Police. The talks have been progressing for the past month and the handover is likely to take place in the next 10 days," said a BMC official, requesting anonymity.
 In September, the BMC had prepared a document to this effect. "It was observed that the manpower at the ward level of BMC for effective enforcement against unauthorised parked vehicles is inadequate. There is no dedicated wing for executing said works at the ward level. However, dedicated personnel is available with the traffic police department. The department may be assigned for towing away vehicles that are parked illegally," the civic body had stated.
 The BMC had introduced the fine on July 7 in Mumbai's four major arterial roads such as Link Road, SV Road, LBS Road and Maharshi Karve Road. Later, the rule was relaxed and parking vehicles within the radius of a km of the civic body's PPLs was reduced to 500 metres.
 The slapping of the exorbitant fine had led to an uptick in the usage of PPLs.
 HT had reported on January 11 that BMC's implementation of fines for illegal parking near 26 PPLs showed positive results.
 According to the civic body's data, the occupancy rate of PPLs last December had increased up to 40%-50%.
 Sunil Sardar, deputy chief engineer, solid waste management (transport wing), BMC, said the transfer of the responsibility to Mumbai Traffic Police is likely to take another 10 days. Nikhil Desai, a civic activist from Matunga, spoke up on behalf of the Mumbaikars.
 'The public does not care much about which authority is levying a fine. Implementation holds the key and the public gains at the end of the day," he said.
 "I have been complaining about two motorcycles parked illegally on a pavement in my neighbourhood. But BMC authorities are yet to act. They have cited that it is under the jurisdiction of Mumbai Traffic Police, who is yet to get on with the job. The public is suffering because of the inaction," he added.
