LAKE FORK- Back in the day, the drill for a crappie fishing trip went something like this: Pull up to a tree with limbs above the water, secure the boat, drop minnows down through the limbs and either catch crappie or spend 30 minutes trying and then move on to the next likely spot. Those days are long gone for Lake Fork guide Seth Vanover and other anglers savvy in the use of their "Livescope", the latest innovation for seeing what's below the surface of the water.
   
 This past week, my friend Phil Zimmerman and I joined Seth and his son Evan for a few hours of catching crappie in a manner that, just a few years ago, most fishermen would have thought magic.
   
 "The basics of crappie fishing such as water depth, structure to fish, etc. have not changed. I still focus on seasonal patterns, fishing shallow during the spawn and following the fish out to deeper structure with the onset of summer. What has changed is how I actually locate them. I 'm fishing the same type structures as I did years ago, at the same times of year, but now with the use of my Livescope, I can actually see below the surface of the water; I can actually see individual fish and drop my baits right on the nose of the fish I am targeting." says Vanover.
   
 Seth studied a waypoint he had marked on GPS and as the boat approached the submerged brush pile, he began studying the screen of the Livescope.
   
 "This brush is literally covered up with crappie, look at those two big ones hanging just about that limb that is 16 feet deep and 7 feet out from the nose of the boat. Let's see if one of these gals might be hungry. "
   
 Watching the screen, we could see Seth's one-eight ounce blue and white jig falling vertically toward the fish. Keeping close eye on the jig and the targeted fish on the screen, he paused the jig a foot above the two big crappie and then dropped it down right in front of the nose of one of them.
   
 It was a whole new experience to watch a fish actually strike a bait below the surface via the screen, rather than watch the rod tip. The big crappie, probably weighing 2 pounds, grabbed the bait and was jerking the rod tip down, all it occured faster than my mind could comprehend. The entire event was crystal clear, in real time on the screen. Seth, who has witnessed this occurrence thousands of times, popped the rod tip up and was hooked solidly to a fish he had targeted on sonar.
   
 During the course of the morning, this scenario played out many times and I won't kid you, It took me a fish or two to get my brain and hook set working together, if this makes any sense to you!
   
 After I learned how to put the bait right in front of the fishes nose, I became become totally absorbed in what was occurring on the screen, forgetting I held in my hands, the key to actually catching the fish, the rod. Rather than waiting for that twitch on the rod when the fish actually struck the jig, I made the mistake of attempting to make the hook set the instance I saw the fish moving to my bait. Seth, who has introduced many to just how lethal the Livescope is in catching crappie, says this is a common mistake with folks learning the new technology.
   
 "The screen will tell you when the fish is making a move on the bait and, when it actually picks it up. When you see this, forget the screen and become tuned in to what you feel on the rod. The bite usually occurs in mock speed, when a fish actually grabs your bait, and if you don't pull back the instant he pulls down, you probably won't catch it."
   
 A sensitive rod that will tell-tell the sometime subtle bite of a crappie is a must. We were using two rods of two different lengths, both Wally Marshall Pro Series. The 12 foot model worked best when precisely dropping the bait to a particular fish being targeted and the 5 foot model for casting. The added length of the 12 footer made it much easier to maneuver the jig so that it would fall vertically, which helps to avoid hang ups. The shorter rod was used when we were pitching jigs to fish a bit farther out but still visible on the Livescope's screen.
   
 Yes, technology has taken catching fish to a whole new level. I remember well years ago using an old iron window weight and a rope marked with electrical tape in one foot increments to determine dept,and then the flasher units, paper graphs, LCD graphs, etc. When each of the new advancements in sonar came out, I thought, 'It just can't get any better than this". Well, with the Livescope, it just got better, a whole lot better. What could possibly be better than actually watching a fish take your bait below the water's surface. Give the engineers a couple more years, we will see!

Will Have to Adapt: Neesham on Playing Behind Closed Doors


--DocBreak--
The Sunwolves, who were in Australia when the season was canceled, temporarily disbanded and the players were sent home. At that point, any further play this year seemed unlikely, but the success of Australia and New Zealand in controlling the health crisis has paved the way for the resumption of competitive rugby in both countries.
 In addition to the Sunwolves, the Australian competition would likely include the Perth-based Western Force, a former Super Rugby outfit. New Zealand is also planning a domestic competition involving its Super Rugby teams.
 Although the Sunwolves' participation would give Japan a much-needed morale boost, the availability of players may be an issue, as team members comprise seven different nationalities. Australian entry restrictions, including quarantine rules, may limit who can take part and how much practice time is available to a team from outside of the country.
 And because the expedition will last for more than two months with no home games in Japan, the financial burden is likely to be heavy.
 Sunwolves CEO Yuji Watase said the squad will probably be cut from around 40 members to 30.
 Due to the cancellation of the Top League season and Japan's summer tests, a Japanese team playing anywhere would be big news.
 "Fans and players feel the same about this," Watase said. "We have to do this if there is a chance."

Glenn Prieto, a business teacher at Maui High School shares his take on the effects of COVID-19 on school. The advisor of Maui High school’s DECA Chapter, Prieto helps his students prepare for a future in business, preparing them for competitions and setting them up for success in the business world. After placing at the Career and Technical Student Organizations conference and qualifying for the International DECA Conference, Prieto and his students were faced with a disappointing reality right as the virus started to make its mark on the United States. “We were planning a trip in April for Maui High DECA students who qualified to compete at the International DECA Conference, which was canceled.” The news did not stop there. As the state started making extensions to spring break as the virus took on Hawai‘i, Prieto was left to question what would happen over the course of the rest of the school year. “Then came the subsequent extension of Spring Break followed by the Stay-at- Home order. Questions started to race through my mind with regards to grades, school work, and what will happen with the kids; graduation; end of year Business Academy events.” With the introduction of distance learning, some of Prieto’s questions were answered and teachers had to face the reality of the situation. “Once the reality settled in, it came down to how can we continue some form of continuity of learning and sense of normalcy to ease anxiety and any other emotions that students may be feeling,” Prieto says. Though new for many students across the state, Prieto is no stranger to distance learning. “I for one had earned my graduate degree mostly through distance learning, it was difficult at first. It takes a lot of preparation on the part of the teacher and a lot of discipline and follow-through for the student. The positive side of it is that it offers flexibility and can happen from anywhere and at any time.” Prieto’s success proves the effectiveness of distance learning on his part but he agrees that, for his students, it is not comparable to traditional classroom learning. “I cannot speak for all students, but for my students, the benefit is not there.” Much of Prieto’s lessons involve engaging his students in real-world situations in their area of learning: business. “It includes hands-on real-world experiences where, for example, finance students operate a satellite branch of a credit union or entrepreneurship students run their own pop-up businesses on campus. Students can learn and interact virtually through distance learning but the hands-on, learn-by-doing experience is not there.” Through these difficult times, Prieto makes sure to utilize the tools that he is provided with to give his students the best online learning experience he can. “I have extended the time usually demanded to allow students the flexibility and time to complete the learning activities. Live sessions are conducted as needed or by appointment and I make myself available through ‘office hour’ times, throughout the hours of the usual school day.” As the virus starts to calm down in the state, Prieto has high hopes for the upcoming school year. “The hope for next school year is that we are still able to offer the same level of learning and activities as well as support for students, no matter what form of schooling will be like. It has been challenging thus far and it will continue to be that way until the pandemic can be faced head-on either through treatment or a vaccine.”

Editor’s Note: This piece by the Lewiston Tribune’s longtime editorial page editor originally ran May 18, 1981, marking in humor the one-year anniversary of the eruption.
 I’m really worried. The Northwest may have survived the volcanic ashfall from Mount St. Helens with courage and aplomb. But will we ever dig out from under all these special newspaper editions commemorating the first anniversary of the eruption?
 On May 18, 1980, I was among the thousands stranded when the volcano exploded and choked highways with blinding volcanic dust.
 On May 18 of this year, I was among the residents of the Northwest covered by a suffocating blizzard of anniversary editions recounting the explosion. We may never dig out.
 I had just got to the bottom of all the stories published last year. It’s been hell. My own newspaper was filled with it for days. I awoke each morning facing dozens of stories and pictures on the volcano and its consequences — stories on the blast, stories on the ash that followed the blast, stories on the politicians who followed the ash.
 About the time the flood of daily stories began to diminish, I entered a supermarket one day and what I saw made my blood run cold.
 It was a special edition of the Vancouver Columbian, the newspaper near the volcano, which flooded the supermarkets with a layer of paper that made the ashfall look like nothing. I felt compelled to buy one. When you live in the Northwest, it’s the only patriotic thing to do.
 But every time I returned to the supermarket there was another new edition by that or some other Northwest newspaper.
 And then the magazines and the booklets began to hit the stands.
 And the television tapes.
 And the salt and pepper shakers, the souvenir plates and the little packets of dust.
 And the T-shirts. My God, you wouldn’t believe the St. Helens T-shirts.
 But then, a couple of months ago, the blizzard of special editions and souvenirs finally began to subside. We all began to breathe a little easier. Before long you could enter a supermarket without finding any more required reading on the volcano. You could pick up your own paper and be cheered to find nothing but ax murders and political corruption.
 But then one morning I awoke in a cold sweat. I could hear the distant rumble of presses, the harmonic tremors of an information industry building up a terrible urge to tell the whole story all over again.
 The flanks of the industry were plainly swelling. The people of the Northwest, so recently recovered from the original eruption of the mountain and of the information industry, were about to experience the latter heartache again. Throughout the region editors were joyously calling, “One more time!”
 The wire machines in the newsrooms began spewing molten amazement over what had happened the year before — stories on people who survived the blast, stories on dogs who survived, stories on the relatives of people who survived, stories on people in Australia who had received letters from relatives in London who had heard about the relative of a dog who survived.
 Northwest newspaper reporters began oozing words — words that trickled down the flanks of a recent memory, mingled in nostalgic gullies with the wire service words, rushed in first-person rivers into the valley and tumbled into a torrent of special editions sweeping aside a whole Sunday of intended gardening, tennis and boating.
 And so here I sit, my nose barely above the stack of newspapers in my apartment, and afraid to go to the supermarket because I know the avalanche that awaits me there.
 The mountain and the ash we can live with. But even now you can feel the rumble of next year’s presses. And the presses for the year after that. And all the years to come.
 I know not when the mountain will erupt again, but the anniversary editions are as predictable as the tides. And as overwhelming.
 My God, will it never end? Will the Northwest never again be free of special editions?

BOISE — Idaho is holding an entirely mail-in primary for the first time as the state works to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Ballots must be requested by Tuesday and returned by 8 p.m. June 2 to local county elections offices, with results announced that evening.
 The Idaho secretary of state’s office said 320,000 ballots have been requested and mailed out, with about 100,000 returned in what could be a record turnout.
 “It’s looking like equal or better than the presidential primary” in March, said Secretary of State Chief Deputy Chad Houck.
 Democratic voters will see one high-profile name on their ballot: Former 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Paulette Jordan of Plummer is running against former congressional candidate Jim Vandermaas, a retired law enforcement worker from Eagle, for a chance to challenge GOP Sen. Jim Risch in November.
 Jordan, who served two terms in the Idaho House of Representatives, garnered national attention during her 2018 campaign amid hopes from supporters that she could become the first Native American governor in the United States.
 Either way, the Democratic nominee will have a tough road ahead of them when they take on Risch, who is seeking his third six-year term representing one of the most conservative states in the nation.
 Jordan, despite the publicity of her gubernatorial campaign in 2018, for example, got only 40 percent of the vote against then-Republican Lt. Gov. Brad Little in the general election.
 Risch is running unopposed in the GOP primary.
 Two other Republicans seeking to represent Idaho in Congress are facing primary challenges.
 Rep. Mike Simpson, who has in office since 1999, faces Kevin Rhoades, a Boise resident and small businessman. Rhoades is trying to position himself to the right of Simpson. But Simpson has a long history of bringing in federal dollars for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory, one of the largest employers in Simpson’s district as well as the state.
 First-term Rep. Russ Fulcher is being challenged by Boise resident Nicholas Jones, who owns several board game shops and burger eateries.
 Democrats competing in the primary are Rudy Soto, a member of the Shoshone- Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall Reservation, and Staniela Nikolova, a University of Idaho law student.
 Idaho Republicans have a closed primary, with ballots available only to registered Republican voters, and the contested congressional seats are typically won by the incumbents.
 Besides those races, all 70 seats in the Idaho House and 35 in the Idaho Senate are on the ballot. However, many of the races are uncontested.
 Republicans hold super-majorities in both chambers, and the toughest test for most Republican officeholders is the primary.
 Some races of note include the contest among four Republicans to replace Rep. Gary Collins of Nampa, who is retiring after 10 terms.
 In eastern Idaho, incumbent Republican Rep. Britt Raybould of Rexburg is being challenged by former Republican Rep. Ron Nate, who previously served two terms before losing in the 2018 primary.
 In northern Idaho, incumbent Republican Rep. Thyra Stevenson had a reelection campaign going but died last Monday following a heart attack. There’s a process to replace her, but there’s also a possibility she will still win the primary because many votes have already been mailed in, potentially complicating filling the seat.

 Ballot request forms can also be returned by mail or dropped off with the county elections office. However they’re delivered, the forms must be received by 8 p.m. Tuesday to be valid.
 Voters will then have until 8 p.m. on June 2 to return the completed ballots to the county elections office, at which time they’ll be tabulated.

Since the beginning of this pandemic, experts have attempted to provide an explanation on how the world could change under strict measures of lockdown and the impact it could have on livelihoods. But one thing is clear – the impact of the pandemic is not as black and white as it seems. In fact, the story of the pandemic can be boiled down to the differential impacts it has on the privileged and the underprivileged, white and non-white, rich and poor, essential and non-essential, able-bodied and disabled.
 In the age of global supply chains which employs over 450 million people, the burden of COVID-19 continues to be borne by workers at the bottom of the chain who have no savings to survive on during such times. A report published by the Centre for Global Workers’ Rights at Pennsylvania State University, drew upon responses from Bangladeshi garment workers who demonstrate the impacts the devastating economic destitution and the closure of factories have had on them. The report suggests that more than a million garment workers have been fired or furloughed and 98.1% of the “buyers refused to contribute to the cost of paying the partial wages to furloughed workers that the law requires.”
 The pledge fund announced by Primark for Bangladeshi garment workers and H&M agreeing to pay for the goods that have already been manufactured in Bangladesh, appear to be a lifeline amid the crisis. However, many buyers and conglomerates have evoked the _force majeure_ clause to cancel their orders, despite contracts not explicitly specifying pandemics as grounds for non- payment. Global conglomerates and clothing brands have managed to find a way to avoid sharing the cost of compensating workers in the supply chains who represent the weakest link. With the pre-existing fragility of social safety nets in countries like Bangladesh and low tax revenues from corporations that use these supply chains, as Naomi Klein writes, the pandemic “could well be the catalyst to shower aid on the wealthiest interests in society, including those most responsible for our current vulnerabilities”.
 The impact of the pandemic on factory workers has exacerbated some of the pre- existing hazards in relation to basic workplace safety. The 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh killed 1138 garment employees. The very corporations that have cancelled orders quoting the pandemic-related economic downturn, chose to look the other way and refused to take responsibility for the rights of factory workers in the aftermath of the tragedy. While the Rana Plaza tragedy may have resulted in efforts to improve working conditions, little has been done to mitigate the precarity of those who continue to work in such factories. With fewer than 5% of garment workers being unionized and many still earning below the legal minimum, the hazards continue to mount.

Silage season has kicked off this week in County Limerick, says Bruree-based agricultural contractor John Sheehy. Mr Sheehy, a former chairman of Farm and Forestry Contractors in Ireland (FCI) who remains on the national executive, said early to mid-May is when they normally begin to motor.Many things stay the same but some are different this year due to Covid-19. A lovely part of country life is when the silage men are invited into farmers&rsquo; homes for food. The leaves of the table are pulled out to make it bigger, everyone sits down for a meal and a chat.&ldquo;It is a beautiful tradition and very much appreciated by us but for the last while we haven't been going into houses. We are still being offered food all the time and it is being brought out to us.&ldquo;We have no problem with that, it is just more awkward for the householder, farmer and their wives having to bring it outside, instead of just turning around and putting it on the table,&rdquo; said Mr Sheehy. Apart from that it is pretty much business as usual.&ldquo;No passengers are allowed which is nearly gone anyway, giving children a drive - that is going to be a no no. Everyone has to watch what they are doing and be mindful of the situation we are in. We all have to do our bit,&rdquo; said Mr Sheehy.Speaking on Sunday, Mr Sheehy said he had two jobs done but this week it is going to &ldquo;kick off&rdquo;. Despite the lack of rain, he says there are fine crops.&ldquo;They are no worse or no better than you would be expecting at this time of the year. There are fine returns, fine crops. Even though we haven&rsquo;t had rain in the short term, we had plenty of it in the long term!&rdquo; laughed Mr Sheehy. Hopefully, the drought of 2018 won&rsquo;t be repeated. Getting drivers has been hard-going in recent years but Covid-19 has sadly changed that.&ldquo;There has been a lot more enquiries, lads dropping in their names to say they are available,&rdquo; confirmed Mr Sheehy, whose new Claas 870 harvester will be taking to the roads and fields. One advantage will be the quieter roads.&ldquo;It will definitely make a difference although the roads aren&rsquo;t as quiet as they were a month ago but still road users have to be aware we are going to be out the next couple of months.&ldquo;We will do all we can to accommodate them but we expect the same in return. We will pull in when we can but people need to be mindful that we could be coming around the bend on narrow roads,&rdquo; said Mr Sheehy.As the Bruree man alluded to, the FCI is particularly concerned about the risk to children on farms this year.FCI national chairman Richard White said most children are off school due to the Covid-19 restrictions and the arrival of the silage contractor can provide some excitement for them, in what can be an otherwise boring time.&ldquo;We are urging all farm families to pay particular attention to child safety on farms over the coming weeks. We are urging farm families not to allow children into silage fields when the harvesting is taking place, from the time of mowing onwards.&ldquo;We are appealing to them to keep children at a safe distance away from the silage pit as trailers unload and the process of building the silage clamp begins. The risks are simply too great,&rdquo; said Mr White.

When it comes to actual game times and schedules, there is still little more than speculation throughout the sports world. Fields and arenas throughout the country have sat empty for over two months
   
 But there has been a flicker of light in sports this week on the soccer fields at The Clubhouse.
   
 Following a decision by USL League One to allow limited groups to participate in modified drills, Tormenta FC has been back in action - to the extent it can be.
   
 Under the current precautions, no more than four players may practice at the same time and are not allowed to have direct contact with one another. Coaches can be present, but are only there for observation and aren’t able to provide instruction during the drills. The players practice in shifts in order to give everyone field time and no one unaffiliated with the team is allowed to be at the practice facility.
   
 “It’s at least something,” Tormenta coach John Miglarese said. “A few months ago, I thought we were having a great offseason and that we were really building a solid and special group of guys. And then everything ends so suddenly and we’ve been dark since.
   
 “Two or three weeks (of postponed games and practices) has turned into two months and now even longer. Our guys have done a good job of keeping up their physical and mental health on their own, but I know it has to be good to be able to kick a ball and do some sort of drill.”
   
 While Tormenta doesn’t have a set date for returning to play, the somewhat relaxed precautions could pave the way for more intense training and a quicker return to actual games if and when they are announced.
   
 Of course, nothing can be a substitute for full-speed action. Exhibition matches aren’t the same as real games, scrimmages aren’t the same as exhibitions and the current allowed activities are a far cry from any of those.
   
 But the biggest obstacle in a possible return to play is in the pace of the preparation.
   
 “We always have the micro and the macro,” Miglarese said. “For the micro, you know you have a game on Saturday and you count down the things you need to do as you go through the week. It’s similar in the macro as you consider progress through the entire season. But right now, there’s neither. There’s no time frame to take into context.”
   
 To the players’ credit, they’ve been finding plenty of ways to keep their bodies and minds fresh. In addition to running and getting in soccer-specific workouts on their own whenever they can, Tormenta players have also been catching up on reading, taking up painting and even learning to sew in order to help produce facemasks for healthcare workers at area hospitals.
   
 Original plans for the 2020 League One season would have seen teams completing the first third of their schedules right about now. There has been no public announcement of what kinds of abbreviated schedules would be considered, but Tormenta will be ready for any chance to get back on the field.
   
 “It’s just a matter of trying to keep ourselves at the right level of preparedness,” Miglarese said. “When the time comes, we don’t want to overdo things and wear guys out just because we’re happy to be back. At the same time, we expect our guys to be ready to go out and compete and win.”

Therefore, trying to discern Keynes’s specific views—whether on trade, or money, or budget deficits, or public investments—almost surely misses the main point. Keynes did not give us a checklist of dos and don’ts other than general ones: Don’t waste human talents and physical resources through wanton unemployment, avoidable wars, or breakdowns of social and trade relations; don’t abuse power; don’t mistake wealth for happiness; and don’t tolerate the wanton suffering of others in the belief that all will be fine in the long run or that suffering is ordained and unavoidable. As the master of practical wisdom, Keynes honed solutions in the context in which crises arose.

TOKYO (AP) — Japan plunged into recession in the first quarter as the coronavirus pandemic battered manufacturing, exports and spending, and economists expect worse damage lies ahead.
 The world's third-largest economy contracted at a 3.4% annual, seasonally adjusted rate in January-March, the Cabinet Office reported Monday. It shrank 0.9% from the previous quarter.
 Analysts say things are expected to get worse as Japan endures its biggest challenge since World War II.
 The latest data put Japan squarely into a technical recession, defined as two straight quarters of contraction. The economy contracted at a 1.9% annual pace in October-December.
 Japan is extremely vulnerable to repercussions from the pandemic given its dependence on trade with both China and the U.S., the country where the pandemic began and the country where it has been hit hardest.
 But trouble was brewing even before the virus began disrupting trade and travel, and more recently, domestic business activity and consumer spending.

As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman took the centre stage on May 16 and uttered the word “aviation”, a few heartbeats skipped. A day earlier, the FM made announcements about agriculture – which was dubbed as the 1991 moment for the sector. Would aviation get a similar treatment?
 While aviation and agriculture are at opposing ends of the spectrum, both have some similarities. Some of them are customers complaining about the trifling price increases, a farmer or an airline taking home little profit and operating on thin margins and long-term debt. While farmers get a waiver or two occasionally, airlines do not. That is because successive governments have seen aviation as luxury and not on priority to move the economy in a country as large as India.
 Aviation was liberalised in the early 1990s leading to a spate of private carriers. None of them are in operation today. While it remained amply clear that cash sops will not be forthcoming, the industry and the wider aviation community hoped for a little respite in other ways — especially after governments in the US, Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands, among others, announced measures to help the airlines directly and indirectly. The finance minister doled out all but three sops for aviation and they were old wine in a new bottle. Airlines have been left high and dry.

When talking about the best coaches in football history, it's impossible to have the conversation without mentioning Don Shula.

As the winningest coach if NFL history, Shula retired with in 1995 with a career coaching record that included 347 wins and 173 losses. Over the years, he also won two Super Bowl Championships. Sadly, Shula passed away earlier this month at age 90. He leaves behind an impeccable legacy and a story that deserve to be told on the big screen. But as with any other biographical role, picking the perfect person to play Don Shula will be one of the most important factors. Here are 5 actors who we think should play Don Shula in a movie.

 The Mirror says some clubs, including Leeds United, West Bromwich Albion, Sheffield Wednesday and Stoke City, carry several players who fall into the £1m-a-year bracket.
 Being forced to offload them at very short notice would have led to bargains for the buying clubs, but the selling clubs would have to take huge hits on the price.

One of South Korea’s top football clubs apologised for causing “deep concern” on Monday after being accused of using sex dolls to fill empty seats at a weekend game.
 FC Seoul insisted the mannequins -- used in the absence of fans, who are banned because of the coronavirus -- had “no connection to sex toys“.
 But some of the artificial spectators, deployed for Sunday’s game against Gwangju FC, wore T-shirts with the logo of SoloS, a sex toy seller.
 Other mannequins, which wore facemasks and were separated according to social distancing guidelines, held placards advertising the company and some of its models.
 Most of them were female, but some were male.
 FC Seoul said the company which provided the mannequins had previously provided them to SoloS, hence the advertising in which they were clad.
 “We are sincerely sorry for causing deep concern to fans,” FC Seoul said in a statement, following uproar from fans and media.
 “We have confirmed from the very beginning that they had no connection to sex toys,” the club said.
 But fans were not convinced.
 “I wonder how they even came up with this bizarre idea. This is an international disgrace,” said one online critic.
 Another fan added: “FC Seoul turned its stadium into a X-rated zone.” Neither the mannequin distributor nor SoloS could immediately be reached for comment by AFP.
 The K-league’s new season kicked off on May 8 after being postponed for more than two months over the coronavirus pandemic, but fans remain barred.
 Instead, clubs have used cardboard cutouts, placards and banners to fill up the stands.
 FC Seoul won the game, held at the cavernous Seoul World Cup Stadium, 1-0.

Rolling out politicians who bring low enthusiasm because of their lack of motivating policy ambitions—like Smith, like Biden—can meaningfully work against Democrats, even when the structural factors, like a widely reviled president and a tanking economy, are working in their favor.

The School-Community Relations Coordinator of Maui High School, Stacy Woodson looks at her view of the virus’ impact on school life. As the Department of Education responded to the virus as the situation escalated, Woodson found a sense of understanding, especially considering the novelty of it all. “This is uncharted territory. I understand that as much as possible they want to make decisions based on information and data that comes in. It's a great big balancing act. Making informed decisions is best and yet at the same time sometimes you just have to make the best call with the information you have in front of you and run with it.” Woodson agrees traditional classroom learning is the best but she also makes sure to consider what is best for the current climate. “For most situations, I feel learning will be more successful in a physical school or educational setting but I feel distance learning was the best alternative and almost the only alternative next to not having any kind of learning at all.” Distance learning is the best alternative to none but there are challenges that can arise out of it. “There are many, many difficulties with trying to make a sudden transition to online learning, especially for a state-wide public school system. Some of the main issues that come up with an abrupt transition to distance learning are access to technology for everyone, technology learning curve, technical issues/malfunctions and then, of course, things like a limitation on what teaching strategies can be utilized when teaching over the internet versus face to face, weakened communication and engagement, etc.” In this evolving situation, Woodson knows everyone is contributing to their best ability. “I think leadership, teachers, parents, students collectively are doing the best they can in the midst of this historic global pandemic.” As her school’s School-Community Relations Coordinator, Woodson is a seasoned user of technology when it comes to her career where she interacts with much of the community through social media platforms but for other school employees, the transition to virtual working is new territory that can potentially bring long-term benefits. “Many who are not as accustomed to tech in their daily activities have had to take the long-resisted plunge to embrace and utilize technology in new ways due to Corona. In a way, that may be one plus coming out of all of this.” Though she sees the positives in this digital revolution, Woodson also sees some difficulty. “A tough part about it in our current situation is that EVERY ASPECT is digital now. There is very little break from technology in the daily routine since it is currently our only source of information, collaboration, socialization, entertainment, etc.” Because of the virus, many school events were canceled, including the beloved graduation of our Seniors. “As far as school events, many of those were just flat out canceled. Graduation is the biggest heartbreak of them all. Any virtual variation that we can think up will still pale in comparison to a traditional ceremony. It is among the biggest heartbreaks caused by COVID in the Education sector.” Alongside our Seniors, Woodson took the time to honor all the individuals in school who were affected. “Ultimately I hope the upcoming school year shows us how quickly we can bounce back from major setbacks like the many that COVID-19 has thrown at us.” Amidst these trying times, Woodson shares her words for the community. “Let's work together, be understanding, be cooperative, be resilient, don't complain, be resourceful, be hopeful, help others where you can.”

"We have no idea what to expect because there's nothing to compare it to," said Newburyport Mayor Donna Holaday. "Nothing even comes close to the economic impact this pandemic is having."
 A big unknown for budget writers is state education funding and local aid, with state coffers also taking a big hit.
 The uncertainty is already prompting some cities and towns to make tough decisions to cut staff and scale back spending plans.
 In Peabody, which has laid off 35 part-time employees, the city is looking at additional layoffs and furloughs as it begins to craft a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. In Methuen, where the budget for next year is already nearly $6 million out of whack, the city has imposed a spending freeze. Beverly has scrapped plans to boost pension payments.
 Geoff Beckwith, executive director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, said the impact of the coronavirus will be far worse than the economic recession of the mid-2000s that pushed many cities and towns to the brink of bankruptcy.
 "Local revenues are dropping like a stone, and there's no end in sight," he said. "This is money that cities and towns count on to balance their budgets."
 He said municipalities are faced with the reality that some residents won’t be able to pay their property taxes, but services such as public schools and waste removal still must be provided. Local leaders will also be reluctant to increase taxes, wary of putting additional burden on residents.

Zachary Carter’s brilliant book enables us to watch the unfolding of Keynes’s insights and the development of his practical wisdom, against the backdrop of history and Keynes’s personal life. Keynes’s early life was comfortable and optimistic—highly intelligent parents, the intellectual atmosphere of Cambridge University, a precocious childhood wherein Keynes’s genius was recognized early on, and the encouragement of those talents with other bright minds at Eton and Cambridge. As an undergraduate, Keynes fell under the influence of Britain’s leading moral philosopher of the day, G.E. Moore, from whom he imbibed the wondrous ideals of the good life and the cultivation of virtues that had been handed down in Western civilization from the Greeks. He fell into a circle of artists and future influencers who would provide the artistic and political leadership of Britain in the coming decades, and who would often serve as Keynes’s muses, guides, and patrons into the corridors of power.

 \---
 ST. MARIES — Harry Treloar was six years old when he got his first toy train — a wind-up steamer that traveled 30 inches of track and tripped a little boy’s imagination.
 Today, some 57 years later, Treloar’s model railroading dreams encompass the entire attic of his home.
 “I’ve got my whole little world up here,” he said, climbing through a trap door into a maze of track, miniature buildings and tiny locomotives.
 “Rainy days, they’re the ticket,” beamed Treloar, “I turn my radio on up here and I’m just as happy as if I had good sense.”
 Model railroad buffs seem to come in two versions — those who like to man the switches and throttle, and those who find fascination in the tinkering and construction. For the most part, Treloar is of the latter persuasion.
 “I like the building, the construction. Running the trains doesn’t get to me very much,” said Treloar. “Of course, once in a while I’ll put in an evening of railroading.”
 Treloar, 63, a retired Potlatch Corp. safety engineer, has built five model railroads. His current endeavor, a magnificent replica of a mountain mining area complete with two 1,300-foot scale ore shafts, is still under construction.
 “The way I work on these things, this will probably be my last,” said Treloar. Once a hard rock miner in Montana, Treloar has also worked for three different railroads, including the Milwaukee Road and the Northern Pacific.
 “You see, when you build a model railroad, you have to have a reason,” said Treloar, explaining that his elaborate HO-gauge model is to exact scale and everything is authentic.
 “Even our brewing house here pertains to the mining theme,” he said, pointing out the hand-crafted building. “Yeah, the miners, they won’t go underground when they don’t have a little something to drink after they come up.”
 Treloar’s penchant for accuracy is such that the two mine shafts, built with 1864 tiny timbers, extends down through the attic floor of his home, Electric powered replicas of huge steam engines lower tiny hoppers down through the floor where ore is scooped up and brought back to the top.
 Once back in the attic, the ore is sent on conveyor through the main mine building and made ready for transportation.
 “I never have to handle the ore,” said Treloar, “I’ll run a train down to the mine for you, so you can see how it operates.” Treloar has some 70 different steam and diesel locomotives and countless other cars.
 “Before I run that engine out, let me show the Mallet,” he said. Easing a throttle ahead, Treloar motioned to the road house, where a superb replica of the old Mallet steam engine chugged into sight. Treloar stopped it, talked about its history, then backed it into the round house again. He resumed the exhibition of how the ore train worked.
 “That little building it’s about to pass right now,” he pointed out as the train neared the mine. “That’s the powder house. That’s where we get the dynamite for the mines. It’s put over there in a remote place so if it blows up it doesn’t get too many of the boys.” Treloar maneuvered the train into place, showed how the ore is dumped into the cars, and then eased the train back onto the main line, destined for points unknown.
 “I try to maintain proper speed and make it look as realistic as possible,” said Treloar.
 Much of his railroad is still on the drawing board. At one end of the attic, he hopes to build a logging town area, where timbers are cut for the mine operation. He plans to paint the walls with forest scenes and build mountains through which his trains will travel. Underground, the mine tunnels must be developed and then enclosed. Lighting will be installed throughout.
 “I’m afraid I won’t ever see it completed,” said Treloar, shutting the powerW down. Like most model railroaders, his dreams are probably bigger than a lifetime can hold.

Today, we do remember. Today we celebrate the return, in some sense at least, normalcy. Once again, though the grandstands remain silent, the sounds of the engines rumbling like thunder upon the asphalt surface have returned to us through the speakers of our televisions. Yes, absence does make the heart grow fonder. Hell, we even got to see Ryan Newman return behind the wheel. We got to have an escape from scare tactics and fear mongering. We got to sense what hope is. What dreams consist of. What a day under the sun feels like again, even if we must keep socially distanced from our fellow enthusiasts.

Food for thought, U.S. labor force is 164.6 million, unemployment is 36.5 million and unemployment rate of 22.1%. I wonder what the unemployment rate would be if we added the number of people on the Paycheck Protection Program. During the Great Depression, in 1933 the unemployment rate was 24.9% and the big reason for a quick unemployment reversal was WWII.

Those figures are believed to understate the true dimensions of the pandemic because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.

I stab my beloved sweet potato with five toothpicks, designating him the crooked star of my kindergarten science experiment. As the newest resident of the water-filled raspberry gelato jar, he is quite the couch potato, spending entire days bathing under the sun. He had been soaking among his similarly transfixed friends for a week when I raised the jar above me to check him out. I knew I was looking for roots, but the idea of them hadn’t even crossed my mind. So when I saw Raspberry Cheesecake’s one small, white knub, like a small finger or a single prong of a fork, I just stared. I remember Elizabeth Gilbert reminding her audience that for centuries artists weren’t believed to be genius, but rather to have one. She urged us to release ourselves from the pressure of creation by recognizing that our genius is outside of us. Like a friend to help us find our words. Lopsided potato in hand, I looked to my Genius. She looks like me, but much, much sexier. She shakes her head and shrugs, “I got nothing.”

The Congress on Monday said the fiscal stimulus package announced by the government is "hopelessly inadequate" given the gravity of the economic crisis as it amounts to only Rs 1.86 crore, which is 0.91 per cent of the GDP. The party sought a revised and comprehensive package of 10 per cent of the GDP.
 Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram said the stimulus package has left several sections like the poor, migrants, farmers, labourers, workers, small shopkeepers and middle class high and dry.
 "We express our thorough disappointment and request the government to reconsider the stimulus package and announce a revised and comprehensive fiscal stimulus package of not less than Rs 10 lakh crore of real additional expenditure equivalent to 10 per cent of GDP," he said at a press conference through video-conferencing.
