WASHINGTON (AP) — The special counsel investigating the origins of the FBI’s probe into the 2016 election now has the authority to use classified information indefinitely in his investigation, a procedural step following his earlier appointment, according to a memorandum issued Tuesday by President Donald Trump.Outgoing Attorney General William Barr named U.S. attorney John Durham as a special counsel in the investigation into the origins of the FBI’s probe of the 2016 election. Durham was already leading an investigation, but the appointment makes it more difficult for the new attorney general to close it. The FBI’s probe morphed into former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of possible Trump-Russia cooperation.The ongoing Durham investigation followed Trump’s repeated calls to “investigate the investigators.” In May 2019, Trump directed U.S. intelligence officials to assist in that review and gave the attorney general permission to declassify or downgrade information or intelligence that relates to his review.Trump’s memo comes as he continues to propel his claims that the Russia investigation that shadowed his presidency was a “witch hunt.” It’s the latest example of efforts by Trump officials to use the final days of his administration to essentially box President-elect Joe Biden in by enacting new rules, regulations and orders designed to cement the president’s legacy.Barr earlier told The Associated Press that he was naming Durham as special counsel in what turned out to be one of his final moves as attorney general. He resigned last week and his deputy Jeffrey Rosen is taking over on Thursday. The move added a wrinkle for whomever Biden nominates as attorney general, especially because Democrats have dismissed Durham’s probe.Also on Tuesday, Trump appointed Ezra Cohen, of the District of Columbia, to chair the Public Interest Declassification Board. Cohen, a Trump loyalist, currently is acting undersecretary of defense for intelligence.The board advises the president about issues pertaining to national classification and declassification policy. Created by Congress, the board is tasked with promoting robust public access to materials that document U.S. national security decisions and activities.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

We Care raised nearly $225,000 in donations this year, which was significantly less than the $417,120 raised last year, but the board pulled $241,017 from the nearly $5 million Hope trust fund to make the beneficiaries whole – and then some.
 Receiving $115,000, up from $105,000 last year, were Salvation Army, Goodfellows, and Kokomo Rescue Mission. Bona Vista received $90,000, up from $85,000 last year, while Mental Health Association and Kokomo Urban Outreach received double last year’s donations at $20,000 and $10,000 respectively.
 Van Taylor, director of the Kokomo Rescue Mission, said he was grateful past We Care volunteers had the foresight to start a trust fund in case of disaster, which proved useful this year.
 “I want to say ‘thank you’ to the leadership and the board of We Care for having a Hope trust fund. Because of your foresight, because you realized that someday like many of us here in Kokomo know, if there’s a tornado or a flood, you have to have insurance. If you don’t have insurance in a disaster, you’re in a double disaster. But because of the board of We Care planning for whatever, and it happened to be a pandemic, we have Christmas.
 “If it hadn’t been for that foresight, that wisdom, that judgment to do that even against some people’s nitpicking – I guess that’s the right word – we wouldn’t have had Christmas. That $240,000, right? We would have been short. So thank you to those people that had that wisdom, took a stand, made the right decision, maybe somewhat unpopular at the time, but was the right decision.”
 The money the rescue mission received will be used to assist about 1,350 men, women, and children in the community by providing them with 15,000 gifts for the Red Ribbon Christmas program.
 Kim Graves, president of the board for Goodfellows, said the donation was much needed as Goodfellows experienced a record year. Last year, the nonprofit received 512 applications for holiday assistance, and that more than doubled this year to 1,139 applications, amounting to 1,772 children in Howard County Goodfellows assisted this year.
 “We Care, you guys are making this possible,” said Graves.
 Brianne Boles, president of Bona Vista, said the donation will make a big impact on her nonprofit, which has been affected financially by the cancellation of fund raisers throughout the year due to the pandemic. Despite the challenging year, Bona Vista has continued to provide services to more than 1,000 individuals daily, Boles said.

MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (WMBF) - Restaurant and bar owners across South Carolina are calling on Gov. Henry McMaster to lift the 11 p.m. “Last Call” order ahead of New Year’s Eve.It was put in place back in July in response to a statewide spike in COVID-19 cases.The South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association (SCRLA) sent a letter to McMaster. In it, the association claims restaurants are low risk when it comes to spreading the virus based on contact tracing data released by the state of New York.The letter went on to say the restaurant and hospitality industry is “suffering as a result of inconsistent, restrictive mandates.” This includes the Last Call order, which prohibits alcohol sales after 11 p.m.“We usually do drink promos, all types of fun stuff for that day, so it kind of sucks that we can’t do it right this year,” Billy Cargill, general manager of Beach House Bar and Grill, saidWith New Year’s Eve being one of the most profitable nights for restaurants and bars, some business owners in Myrtle Beach believe the restriction may put a damper on this year’s celebrations.“Why would all that extra money to have to shut everything down at 11 o’clock before the clock strikes 12 anyway?” Doane Widenhouse, general manager of Barrell Sports Bar and Grill, said.“We’re going to get 60% of people to come here around 9 o’clock and an hour and a half later turn them away,” Cargill said. “Kind of defeats the whole purpose of coming to a bar.”SCRLA said the National Restaurant Association estimates more than $240 billion will be lost in sales by the end of the year. Widenhouse said he’s lost 50% of revenue because of the order.“The little guy like me ... we don’t have any power or say so, but when you get a big organization like the South Carolina Restaurant Association standing up for us it’s a good thing,” he said.While restaurants want to see the order lifted, Cargill said he understands the pandemic has made it tough on everyone, including McMaster.“I love the idea of it,” Cargill said. “I just know he’s trying his best to keep everybody safe - customers and employees alike - so it’s kind of hard to judge from his perspective.”Copyright 2020 WMBF.

In the past, only persons of great repute and integrity used to be the members of the search committees. No one whatsoever could have even dared to seek favours from them nor they have ever been found showing any laxity in their efforts to search and select the most appropriate persons for the post. Fortunately, there is no dearth of people of great repute and integrity in the country but unfortunately such people by and large are ignored for such a crucial national duty, generally unwittingly. If the chancellors want to see our universities competing at the global level, to feature among the top 100 universities, there is an urgency to see only the most worthy people  getting appointed as vice chancellors. The only stepping stone to achieve this noble goal would be constituting search committees consisting of great personalities, giving them freehand to search and select the outstanding and enthusiastic institutional leaders for our universities. Equally important would be that once a search committee is constituted, it is not made to report anybody till the task is finished as per the laid down procedures.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a wave of lame duck pardons, including two for men who pleaded guilty in Robert Mueller's investigation, as well as ones for Republican allies who once served in Congress and military contractors involved in a deadly shooting of Iraqi civilians.
 The pardons of former campaign aide George Papadopoulos, former US congressmen Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins, and the four Blackwater guards involved in the Iraq massacre kick off what is expected to be a flurry of pardons and commutations in the coming weeks as Trump concludes his term.
 Also included in the batch announced on Tuesday are Alex van der Zwaan, the Dutch lawyer who was sentenced to 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to lying to Mueller investigators; two border patrol agents convicted in 2006 of shooting and wounding an unarmed undocumented immigrant and then covering it up; and several people convicted of non-violent drug crimes serving lengthy sentences.

SACRAMENTO, Calif.
 California Gov. Gavin Newsom selected Secretary of State Alex Padilla on Tuesday to be a U.S. senator, a pick that sends a Latino to the Senate for the first time in the state's history.
 Padilla called it a "tremendous point of pride" to be the state's first Latino senator and reflected on the hard work of his parents, who came to the United States from Mexico and worked as a short-order cook and a housekeeper.
 "There's millions of other families that are equally contributing in powerful ways in each community throughout the state and throughout the nation," he said in an interview. "These are important perspectives to bring to policymaking and problem solving."
 Padilla, 47, was the favorite in a crowded field of possibilities to fill out the remainder of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' term. She plans to step down from the seat in January ahead of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.
 Padilla will need to run for a full six-year term in 2022. The appointment gives him an advantage, but he's still likely to face challengers, some within his own party. California's top-two primary system allows two Democrats to face off in a general election.
 "Through his tenacity, integrity, smarts and grit, California is gaining a tested fighter in their corner who will be a fierce ally in D.C., lifting up our state's values and making sure we secure the critical resources to emerge stronger from this pandemic," Newsom said in a statement.
 Padilla's appointment gives a new level of representation to Latinos, who make up the state's single largest demographic group at nearly 40% of the population of almost 40 million.
 But Newsom's choice means there will be no Black women in the 100-member Senate. Harris, whose father is Jamaican and mother Indian, was the only Black woman in the Senate, and Black leaders had been lobbying Newsom to appoint either U.S. Rep. Karen Bass or House colleague Barbara Lee to replace her.
 Bass, who had been vocal about the need for the Senate to have a Black woman, congratulated Padilla, a fellow Los Angeles native with whom she served in the Legislature. She said Padilla would be a "champion following a distinguished line of individuals who have shattered glass ceilings and hurdled obstacles in their way."
 The praise wasn't universal. Democrat London Breed, the first African American woman to be elected mayor of San Francisco, called the decision "unfortunate."
 "This is a real blow to the African American community, to African American women, to women in general, and I think it's really challenging to put it in words," she said.
 Padilla said he doesn't take the comments personally and plans to be the best senator for all Californians.
 "We celebrate the milestone, but all it is is an opportunity to do good work and improve people's lives," he said.
 Later Tuesday, Newsom announced he would nominate Assemblywoman Shirley Weber as California's next state elections chief. Weber, of San Diego, heads the California Legislative Black Caucus and would be the first Black person to hold the office. The nomination is subject to approval in the Legislature.
 Weber presided over the Electoral College that met in Sacramento earlier this month.
 Newsom called Weber, the daughter of sharecroppers, "a tireless advocate and change agent with unimpeachable integrity." Padilla called her a fierce advocate for civil rights and voting rights.
 Padilla was first elected as California's secretary of state in 2014 and won a second term four years later. In that position, he has overseen California's vast elections apparatus, including the rollout of a more robust vote-by-mail system.
 In the November election, California for the first time mailed a ballot to every registered voter. Padilla previously oversaw the implementation of the Voter's Choice Act, a 2016 law that allowed counties to mail all registered voters a ballot. The state now has a record 22 million registered voters.
 Padilla lives in Los Angeles with his wife and three sons, ages 5, 7 and 13.
 His appointment will bring geographic diversity to California's representation in Washington. California's other senator, 87-year-old Dianne Feinstein, is from San Francisco. Harris is from neighboring Oakland and built her political career in San Francisco before moving to Los Angeles. Newsom is the former mayor of San Francisco.
 Feinstein, for whom Padilla once worked, supported his nomination in early December.
 He and Newsom have a long relationship. When Newsom first ran for governor in 2009, Padilla chaired his campaign. Newsom dropped out when former Gov. Jerry Brown entered the race and instead ran for lieutenant governor, a job he held for eight years.
 When he ran again for governor in 2018 in a competitive primary, Padilla endorsed him over other prominent Democrats.
 The campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Latino Victory Fund were among the groups advocating Padilla's selection.
 "This marks a long-overdue milestone for the Latino community, and it's a bold step towards having a Senate that looks like the communities it serves," Nathalie Rayes, Latino Victory Fund president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
 Republicans quickly criticized Newsom's announcement.
 "Through the looking glass of California politics, our state's top elections official will now become a U.S. Senator without an election," tweeted Republican state Assemblyman Kevin Kiley, a frequent critic.
 Padilla has been on the state's political scene for more than two decades. He was first elected to serve on the Los Angeles City Council in 1999, at age 26.
 He represented a Los Angeles-area district in the California state Senate from 2006 to 2014 and chaired the Committee on Energy, Utilities and Communication. He authored a wide range of legislation, including a law to make restaurants list their calorie counts and another to create California's earthquake early warning system.
 He has an engineering degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and he previously served on the school's governing board.
 Padilla, having won twice statewide, starts with an advantage going into the 2022 campaign. In 2018, he won reelection with 7.9 million votes, more than Newsom and the second-highest total for any statewide officer behind Controller Betty Yee.
 But a generation of California politicians are hitting term limits in their current jobs or seeking to move up in the state's political pecking order. Underscoring the quick pivot to a reelection campaign, Padilla released a nearly 2-minute video Tuesday doubling as a biographical spot and a campaign ad paid for by "Alex Padilla for Senate."
 Padilla faced criticism this year for awarding a $35 million contract to SKDKnickerbocker for a voter education campaign ahead of the November election. SKDKnickerbocker had ties to Joe Biden's presidential campaign, prompting criticism that Padilla was using taxpayer dollars with a political agenda. Then Yee, the controller and a fellow Democrat, refused to authorize payment of the contract, saying her office didn't have authority.
 He said he does not have regrets about awarding the contract to the firm and that it's "only a matter of time" before the payment issue is settled.
