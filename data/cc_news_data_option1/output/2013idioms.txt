This month, the Imperial Valley, a farming region in California on the border with Mexico, is experiencing a spike in hospitalizations that some believe is driven by the same phenomenon González referenced.
 In Tijuana, it remains unclear where the first coronavirus cases originated, though state officials have said the first confirmed case was a man who had traveled to the U.S. While that's one possibility, the city also sees many international visitors and has numerous links with Mexico City, which is by far the hardest-hit place in the country. Gama used a mask and gloves on both sides of the border and doesn’t know where he got infected.
 “There (in the U.S.) I didn’t really know where to run to, and my whole family is in Tijuana,” he said. “They didn’t check me or ask me anything” when he crossed into Mexico, Gama said. Days later, he tested positive.
 He is now recovering in his parents’ home and says so far no one else in his family feels ill.
 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to death.
 The Trump administration this week extended its border restrictions for a month and, on paper, Mexico has imposed the same limits on nonessential traffic from the U.S. In reality, Mexican officials generally check only pedestrians for symptoms. Meanwhile, most commercial traffic, which is considered essential, and travelers like Gama, with rights to live and work in both countries, continue to cross in large numbers in both directions.
 That has officials worried that Tijuana could see a resurgence in the coming weeks, even though for now the city appears to have passed the peak. The city's intensive-care units were only about 60% occupied this week, and it has set up neighborhood clinics and new wards for patients with less serious symptoms.
 José María Ramos, a professor and researcher at the College of the Northern Border in Tijuana, said Trump’s priority appeared to be limiting migration rather than protecting public health. He criticized Mexico’s government for not pushing back more.
 “We’re in a national emergency, and health has to be part of the present and immediate future,” Ramos said.
 For some touched by the virus, temporarily sealing the border would make sense.
 “The people come and go and carry the microbe from the United States or from Tijuana," said Miguel Angel Jiménez, a 57-year-old diabetic who contracted COVID-19 in April and is just beginning to recover. "So we’re never going to end this situation.”

To chip away at those numbers, health officials are increasingly targeting workplaces, to reduce transmission among essential workers who don’t have the luxury of avoiding others. King County is putting more effort into helping businesses take precautions and pinpoint clusters of cases as soon as possible, Duchin said.
 The Benton-Franklin Health District recently distributed 6,000 masks to farmworkers and has been helping employers with infection control measures. But at the same time, Dawson said, he’s increasingly seeing videos of softball games and other gatherings popping up on social media.
 “We’re certainly worried about that,” he said. “Single events can have a significant impact on our community.”
 People west of the Cascades are also getting restless.
 “You can just look around you and see there are more people out and about and doing things,” Duchin said. As long as people keep their distance, being outside is actually a good thing — because the risk of transmission is lower, he added.
 But in the face of greater mobility and interaction, the key to bringing disease levels down is quickly identifying new infections. However, testing has actually declined recently in King County, even though the capacity remains high, Duchin said.
 “We would like to see more people coming forward to be tested,” he said.
 Health agencies across the state are beefing up their contact tracing, which is more essential than ever to slowing the spread of the virus. The Benton- Franklin Health District has been doing a good job of alerting people who may have been exposed, but now needs to step up efforts to provide daily reminders urging those folks to self-isolate, Dawson said.
 King County staff are now following up with contact tracing for about half of newly confirmed local cases, with state health department staff handling the rest. The county is also running a pilot project that involves gathering much more detailed information from infected people, in the hopes of better identifying the major, ongoing risk factors and exposures, Duchin said.
 Statewide, 574 people were hospitalized for confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, as of May 20, according to the Washington State Hospital Association. In Seattle, the total is about 200, Duchin said.
 Dr. Chris Dale, chief quality officer for Swedish Health Services, said their census of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 62 on May 20, down from a high of 175 during the pandemic’s initial peak. Like most other medical centers across the state, Swedish has ample capacity for future cases, even as elective surgeries are resuming.
 “It will require vigilance,” Dale said. “We are paying close attention to the numbers and what we’re seeing in the community.”
 Duchin said the Inslee/CDC criterion for infection rates is a reasonable target to shoot for. But it might not be achievable within a reasonable period of time when measured against the economic and social costs of ongoing shutdowns.
 “Ultimately, if we are not able to get to that magic number of 16 cases per day, but we see that we’re still able to manage because we’ve got capacity in our health care system and in our public health system and our vulnerable populations are not experiencing outbreaks that are overwhelming us,” he said, “then I think we’ll have to consider moving forward — very carefully."
