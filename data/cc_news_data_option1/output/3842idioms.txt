Part a.) is the easy bit because we assume that by and large the underlying motivations that drive human behaviours won't change. It's true in most crises there is much talk of how different society will be in the future but that rarely persists for long and people go back to wanting a job, love, family, homes, nice clothing, holidays, etc. We expect the same to be true when this is well and truly behind us. At a government level we do expect there to be post crisis changes so that we don't get a repeat. Just as the ﬁnancial crisis ended up in measures that have made the banking system so much safer, so we expect the same for pandemic early detection and preparation. Governments will never want to be caught out like this again.

Mr Monks adds: "The more hours workers are currently doing, the smaller the rise in business costs associated with keeping them on under the new scheme. That's because at higher levels of hours worked, the subsidy that firms must pay for unworked hours shrinks."
 Accordingly, he notes, it is difficult to estimate how many jobs will be lost under the new scheme without knowing how many hours furloughed employees are currently working.
 Nor is that the only kink in the system. The new programme appears to create incentives for companies to keep people in full-time work while letting go those who are only employed on a part-time basis.
 One quirk, identified by Mr Monks, is that it would be more effective for a company to have one person on full pay rather than three on one-third of full pay.

The overarching need to tell tales, at all costs, proved Immeltâs undoing. His reliance on Beth Comstock, the chief marketing officer, and her belief that the company needed merely to âpick a simple storyâ¦and tell it again, and again, and again,â helped lead the executive team to ignore facts and figures that got in the way. It also spawned stupid slogans like âImagination at Workâ, which Immelt once declared was âa reason for beingâ. And it spawned a doomed effort to cast itself as America's oldest startup, with billions of dollars frittered away on its "Predix" software and data analytics project.

Not even in the 'beer and sandwiches' era of the 1970s, when all-powerful union barons would be invited to No 10 for meetings with Labour prime ministers like Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan, has a TUC general secretary received such an accolade - and certainly not from a Conservative chancellor. Nor has the CBI always been supportive of government policy.
 On Friday, Dame Carolyn fended off criticism of Mr Sunak's package, pointing out that the existing furlough scheme - like the new job support scheme - also contained an employer contribution.
 She told Sky News: "It's a tough message but I think it's the right message - we want jobs that have a future to be protected.
 "What employers will be asking themselves is do they think these jobs will come back and, if they do, they will make that investment.
 "Many are doing that - they want to keep their skilled people, they want to do the right things by their staff, and we think many employers will take advantage of this because they do see demand coming back over the longer run.
 "For employers who don't see demand coming back, this will not be the right scheme - they will be looking at the loan schemes, at the other relief that there is in place, but for many employers, particularly those with skilled people in manufacturing supply chains, this will be a real lifeline."
 In fairness to the chancellor, he is not disguising the fact that not every job will be saved, even hinting at times that he thinks his cabinet colleagues have unnecessarily endangered jobs by placing fresh impositions on social movement.
 Perhaps the greater criticism that can be laid at his door is that he said rather less, yesterday, on helping find new jobs for the thousands of Britons who are set to lose theirs.
 Dame Carolyn argued that employees put on part-time hours could be usefully retrained and reskilled during the hours in which they were not working.
 Few familiar with the UK's woeful record on productivity will disagree with that.


--DocBreak--
"The chancellor's job support scheme is both shorter in duration and is limited solely to part-time workers. In effect, those companies who can somewhat manage to keep trading over the winter months will get some government support, while others who can't will either be required to pause trading or to continue with ongoing redundancy plans."
 Asked by reporters by how much unemployment might rise during coming months, Mr Sunak declined to give a figure, instead pointing them towards recent forecasts made by the Bank of England and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility.
 The Bank is predicting a rise in the jobless rate to 7.5% by the end of the year, up from the current 4.1%, but that was a prediction made before the government's latest curtailments on social movement announced earlier this week.
 The OBR sees the jobless rate being closer to 9% - translating to a total of around 3.1 million unemployed.
