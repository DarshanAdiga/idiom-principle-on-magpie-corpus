Bigger used to be better in aviation, with the Boeing 747 affectionately nicknamed "Queen of the Skies" since it could fly longer with more passengers than its competitors. But taking the place of the A380 and 747 are not larger jets but smaller ones.
 Efficient, twin-engines planes are now all the rage among airlines with the likes of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 XWB replacing their predecessors as the flagships of the fleet despite their smaller stature. Having four engines no longer means what it used to and airlines are realizing they can get by with fewer.
 The Boeing 747 once opened routes that were previously inoperable nonstop but now, the 787 and A350 take up a majority of the spots on the list of world's longest flights with the latter boasting a top range greater than the newest 747, according to Airbus. An A350-900 currently flies the world's longest route between Singapore and Newark, on temporary hiatus due to the pandemic.

We are to be peaceable. Christians should avoid quarrels. That doesn’t mean we don’t make a stand, but it does mean when we stand, we are seen standing with our Lord. Billy Graham was a master at addressing the issues without fanning the flames. He seemed to always bring the topic around to God’s love and forgiveness. In both speech and behavior, we should be agents of peace.
 We are to be considerate. Christians should be gentle and gracious. Gentleness is a fruit of the spirit, not a product of our world. Grace is a gift from God. Both gentleness and graciousness can be respected regardless of the debate. It is believers who are admonished to, “do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” We should give others the benefit of the doubt. We have the possibility of a foe becoming a friend. Saul of Tarsus became Paul the Apostle because he met Jesus, but he also met Ananias who shared gentleness with an enemy.
 We are to show true humility to all men. Christians should be courteous, and meek. We should be calculating and deliberate in remaining under the control of the Holy Spirit as we relate to those who don’t understand. At the end of the day, believers desire to know that God is on their side. For that to happen, in the heat of the day, believers need to get in line with the One they follow.
 Remember, we are to be in the world but not of it!

Yet you never sense that Seimetz is trying to be topical about anything or issue some pre-COVID state of the nation. She Dies Tomorrow is undeniably a horror movie, complete with intense music cues and glimpses of blood-smeared walls, but it's an intimate one. It's probably not a coincidence that the lead character is named after her creator, or that the film's early scenes of Sheil wandering around her house, isolated and on edge, feel so uncomfortably, emotionally naked. (It's also tough to watch the movie's opening vignette of Audley, raging and violently trashing a living room, without thinking of this recent news story.) Seimetz has stocked her cast with longtime collaborators, scenesters and 21st century indie-film stalwarts, ranging from Chris Messina, Josh Lucas and Gina Rodriguez to experimental filmmaker James Benning, TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe and Katie Aselton; it's worth noting that the latter is married to Mark Duplass, thus fulfilling the mandate that all microindies must include at least one Duplass family member. Sheil, however, is the sun around which all of this anxiety revolves, and the key to what makes the film feel as if the center can't hold. Her stock in trade is usually a sort of low-key blank affect — few actors have done more with near- expressionless performances (see Kate Plays Christine) — and to see that gift utilized here, broken up with the occasional breakdown, furthers the feeling that everything is numbingly coming unmoored. Her calmness and resignation is eerie.

 We are a country of one people, Black, White, Brown. But Trump relishes in dividing us, as was done decades ago. Trump would have been better suited to have lived in 1861. Then he could have had his own statue, riding a horse for the Confederates.

Then again, so is the film's entire portrait of a society that feels overcome by a viral sense of gloom, doom and panic-stricken pessimism writ large. Because they would not stop for death, it kindly stopped for them, and it's sent a meeting invite to the Outlook calendar in your skull for tomorrow. The apocalypse, however, is now. Seimetz, Sheil and their cohorts have delivered a contagion movie set to stun rather than kill, which somehow makes all of it feel that much more close to home. And for a film so attuned to the rhythms of loneliness, _She Dies Tomorrow_ manages to mine the uncertainty and dread everybody feels right now -- which oddly makes _you_ feel like you aren't alone at all. It feels both timeless in its ability to channel a universal fear of mortality and if it has arrived, regrettably, right on time.
