 The dip in new cases from 109 last week to 82 this week comes two weeks to the day since Mankato's mask mandate took effect July 10.

That palpable angst can certainly be read as that familiar straightforward, universal yearning for people and relationships that aren't coming back. Still, it's hard not to read many of the lyrics in light of Glenn's coming out and loss of faith. Nowhere is this more on the nose than on the song "Holy Ghost."

_Love on the Spectrum_ is, by and large, seemingly well-meaning and intermittently charming. It presents a relatively benign and non-judgmental look at the romantic struggles and triumphs of a variety of different individuals on the spectrum. Some have already found love and are navigating the challenges of long-term relationships and major life changes. Most are still on the hunt. Occasionally Jodi Rogers, a relationship expert who works with autistic people, shows up to offer advice. A narrator erratically offers some general facts about autism in an effort to provide some greater context to the proceedings, though most of the heavy lifting comes from a subject named Olivia, a self-aware and witty actor who clearly has a lot of experience trying to explain herself and all of autism to other people.
