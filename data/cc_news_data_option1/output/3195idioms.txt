ROME (AP) — Pope Francis continued cleaning house in Poland on Thursday following revelations of clergy sexual abuse and cover-up, replacing the powerful archbishop of Gdansk on his 75th birthday. While all Catholic bishops must offer to retire when they turn 75, it is highly unusual for the pope to accept such a resignation on a prelate's actual birthday. Doing so suggests that Francis was keen to send a signal showing his seriousness about ending the culture of concealment within the Polish church hierarchy. The pope named a temporary administrator to run the Gdansk archdiocese after accepting the resignation of Archbishop Slawoj Leszek Glodz. Glodz was featured in one of the devastating recent documentaries about priestly sex abuse and cover-up in Poland that have sparked a reckoning in the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country. In the 2019 film “Tell No One,” Glodz is shown eulogizing a known pedophile priest, the Rev. Franciszek Cybula, the personal chaplain to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, at his funeral despite knowing of his abuse. Abuse survivors also included Glodz in a report identifying two dozen current and retired Polish bishops accused of protecting predator priests. The report was delivered to Francis on the eve of his 2019 global abuse prevention summit at the Vatican. The archbishop had been criticized by prominent Polish survivor Barbara Borowiecka, a victim of one of Poland's most famous Solidarity-era priests, the late Rev. Henryk Jankowski. A statue of Jankowski in Gdansk was toppled and eventually removed last year following her revelations. Borowiecka, whose decision to go public with her story helped kick-start the Polish reckoning, was euphoric when she learned of Glodz's replacement. She forwarded several emails she had sent to the...

Across the globe, Indigenous populations face a multitude of formidable threats including industrialization, deforestation, and climate change. Though many non-Indigenous populations are grappling with the rapid society-wide upheaval caused by a pandemic for the first time in living memory, Indigenous peoples are all too familiar with the vulnerabilities these diseases expose. In time, we may measure Covid-19 casualties not simply in lives lost but also in traditions erased. Armed with knowledge of the devastation past pandemics have wrought on Indigenous communities, and with response plans created together with rather than for the communities they seek to aid, we may, this time, minimize both kinds of loss.

All-Pro tight end George Kittle has agreed to a five-year, $75 million extension with the San Francisco 49ers that is the richest contract ever at the position. A person familiar with the deal says the sides agreed Thursday on the deal to keep Kittle off the market next offseason. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the contract hadn’t been announced by the team. NFL Network first reported the terms and says the deal includes an $18 million signing bonus. Locking up Kittle was a high priority this offseason for the Niners and they were able to get it done two days before the first full team practice at training camp. Kittle had been one of the NFL’s biggest bargains after being drafted in the fifth round in 2017 and now he gets the biggest contract ever at the position. The previous high for annual value on a multiyear contract for a tight end, according to overthecap.com, was the $42 million, four-year deal Austin Hooper signed this offseason in Cleveland. Hunter Henry is playing this season for the Chargers on a $10.6 million franchise tag. The Niners could have used the tag on Kittle the next two offseasons, but instead managed to work out a long-term deal that satisfied both sides. Kittle has been the most productive tight end in NFL history through his first three seasons with 197 catches for 2,664 yards. But he is almost equally as skilled as a blocker in the run game where he is a key piece in coach Kyle Shanahan’s dynamic offense. The Niners averaged 5.0 yards per carry last season with Kittle on the field, compared to 3.5 yards per carry without him, according to NFL NextGen stats. After a solid rookie season, Kittle broke through in 2018 when he set an NFL record for yards receiving in a season for tight ends when he had 88 catches for...

BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) — People said we were crazy. We said we’d be careful. Maybe so, my doctor-uncle warned, but it would only take one moment of carelessness to get infected — one time finding ourselves too close to unmasked people. Others raised eyebrows in Zoom calls, silently judging our desire to spend a nonessential week at the beach in South Florida, the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. Then I pointed out that we’d be traveling from Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp has steadfastly refused to order mask-wearing, just like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Only Kemp has gone further, saying most coronavirus infections are just like “a stomach bug or a flu or anything else,” and forbidding mayors from doing more than he would to preserve public health. When it comes to deaths from COVID-19, Georgia is winning this awful contest, with a rate of 36 per 100,000 people, compared to 33 in Florida, during the vacation week I’d signed up for. My family is incredibly privileged to be able to hunker down in a home with a backyard big enough for chickens, a vegetable garden and a berry patch. And in a world where so much is beyond our control, we remain determined to be the last ones to get sick from COVID-19. So we’ve hardly left since March, working and studying from home, buying veggies at open-air markets and ordering meat and milk delivered. We’ve kept up with friends by using “outdoor voices” heard from a distance or through three layers of cotton. As rewards, we’ve indulged in an occasional carry-out meal or ice cream cone. But our sanctuary had become stifling. As Georgia’s sweltering summer deepened, with schools going online and the pandemic’s horizon stretching, our family was on edge. To summon the stamina required to endure...

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO Sin embargo no siempre se encuentran con el mejor ambiente por lo que las plataformas estan buscan la manera de brindarles herramientas para hacerlos sentir mas seguros. Tal es el caso de los controles para conversaciones en Twitter.  La plataforma de microblogging estuvo probando con un numero limitado de usuarios nuevas configuraciones para brindar a las personas mas control sobre las conversaciones que mantienen. Pero ha dado a conocer que dichas herramientas de conversacion ya estan disponibles para todos, por lo que ya no tendran que enfrentar respuestas no deseadas. Ya que tu Tweet equivale a tu espacio, ya es hora de despedirse de los llamados Reply Guys, señalo la empresa en un comunicado.  En las primeras pruebas Twitter descubrio que las personas han utilizado esta configuracion para organizar entrevistas y paneles, compartir lo que piensan, y realizar anuncios. Hemos aprendido que esta configuracion ayuda a algunas personas a sentirse mas seguras y podria dirigir a conversaciones mas significativas, afirmo. Sin embargo la plataforma social aclaro que estos controles no impiden que los usuarios puedan conocer diferentes puntos de vista, unicamente se sienten mas comodas Twitteando, mas protegidas del spam y el abuso.  Twitter afirmo tambien que las personas que utilizan estas herramientas comparten mas lo que piensan y buscan con mas frecuencia comentarios adicionales, cuando las respuestas son limitadas. Incluso, afirma, aun se pueden compartir opiniones diferentes a traves de Retweets con comentarios que, a veces, llegan a una audiencia mas grande que el Tweet original.  A traves de esta nueva configuracion ahora es posible tener mas control sobre quien responde a tu Tweet. Un espacio para todos  Twitter esta llevando a cabo diversos esfuerzos para que mas personas se sientan seguras y libres de utilizar la plataforma y en el marco del Dia Internacional de los Pueblos Indigenas se convirtio en un espacio para resaltar el valor cultural de estas comunidades a traves de diferentes acciones e iniciativas. Por ejemplo realizo una clase de idioma Maya con Nictee Guzman (@NicteeGM), una fotografa mexicana originaria de Yucatan, que imparte clases en linea para financiar su carrera y resaltar el orgullo de su lengua.  Asimismo realizo sesiones de lectura en lenguas nativas con Victoriano de la Cruz (@tepoxteco3), linguista e investigador mexicano que tradujo la novela Pedro Paramo, de Juan Rulfo, al idioma nahuatl. Un ejemplo mas es Luis Flores (@LuisTenek), originario de San Luis Potosi y hablante de la lengua Tenek, quien publico un libro con los cuentos de los abuelos de su comunidad y hablo al respecto a traves de la cuenta de Twitter de Activismo Lenguas (@ActLenguas) el pasado 5 de agosto. Activismo Lenguas es una cuenta que ademas se ha dado a la tarea de congregar a un grupo de jovenes indigenas de Mexico que, a traves de una campaña en Twitter, cuentan sus experiencias para promover sus lenguas y culturas indigenas.En contra del discurso de odio Promover mas voces y da r mayor control a los usuarios sobre sus cuentas no es la unica manera de fomentar un ambiente seguro. Twitter tambien esta combatiendo el discurso de odio asi como la informacion falsa o imprecisa con respecto al Covid-19. De hecho, a partir de este año la plataforma cambio sus reglas para evitar la difusion de enlaces dañinos que tocan diversos temas como terrorismo, violencia y discurso de odio, ademas de aquellos que apuntan a otras cosas el malware y el correo no deseado. Incluso, en las ultimas semanas, Twitter tomo medidas energicas en contra de un grupo que difunde teorias de conspiracion, elimino la cuenta de un ex lider del grupo Ku Klux Klan y hasta ha colocado etiquetas de verificacion de hechos en algunos de las publicaciones del presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump.
