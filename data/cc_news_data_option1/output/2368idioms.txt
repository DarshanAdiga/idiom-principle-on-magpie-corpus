The Food and Drug Administration on Monday for the first time gave a green light to a game-based therapeutic: a video game meant to be prescribed to kids with ADHD. The game, known as EndeavorRx and developed by Boston-based Akili Interactive Labs, can now be marketed as a way to improve attention function in kids with ADHD as measured by computerized testing. Physicians can prescribe it to children between the ages of 8 and 12 who have an ADHD diagnosis and have demonstrated an issue with attention. (Robbins, 6/15)

For patients who had attempted or were considering suicide, brief encounters with healthcare providers reduced the risk of subsequent suicide attempts and improved access to follow-up care, according to a meta- analysis of 14 trials.In a pooled analysis of 4,270 suicidal patients, those who underwent brief interventions, consisting of a single in-person encounter, had a significantly lower risk of attempting suicide again in the next 2-12 months compared with those who did not undergo them (pooled odds ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.87), reported Stephanie K. Doupnik, MD, MSPH, of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and colleagues.These brief encounters were also associated with a significantly higher chance of accessing follow-up care within 3 months (pooled OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.80-4.17), but they were not associated with significant reductions in depression symptoms 2-3 months later, they wrote in JAMA Psychiatry.Many interventions were really focused on care coordination, reducing barriers to attending mental health appointments by addressing transportation issues or helping remind patients, Doupnik told MedPage Today. The interventions rely on key principles like having outreach with caring contacts ... making sure people don't have access to lethal means, and other things that are fundamental in reducing the risk of repeat suicide attempts.The fewer people who attempt suicide, the fewer that die by suicide, and these results have important clinical implications, that should motivate healthcare systems to implement these types of brief interventions, commented Nadine M. Melhem, PhD, and David Brent, MD, both of the University of Pittsburgh, in an accompanying editorial.However, other interventions, like intensive care plus outreach, and follow-up with brief interventions, could also work in different contexts and should not be discounted, Melhem and Brent commented.They wrote that we have evidence-based treatments in our arsenal to fight the suicide epidemic that work in different settings and different populations. What we need to do next is to implement them at the appropriate point of contact in the health care system and train clinicians to deliver them.Before interventions are implemented, however, the medical community should embrace widespread screening to identify individuals at risk, they noted, adding that these findings could not be more timely in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on mental health.Melhem and Brent stated that we need to be prepared with brief suicide preventive interventions that every clinician could deliver face to face or through telemedicine.Trials conducted between 2000-2019 that measured the effects of a singular in-person encounter and included a comparison group were used in this analysis. Brief interventions included providers making telephone calls or sending postcards, helping patients identify suicide warning signs, and coordinating follow-up care.Of 14 studies, seven measured subsequent suicide attempts, nine examined linkage to follow-up care, and six looked at depression symptoms as primary outcomes. Most studies involved patients with prior or current suicidal ideation or attempts and took place in hospital emergency departments or hospitals, where most encounters occurred.Overall, the cohort in the pooled analysis that underwent a brief intervention saw a 3.5% reduction in subsequent suicide attempts, corresponding to 78 fewer attempts. The group had a 22.5% absolute increase in completed follow-up as well, researchers reported.The pooled effect size of included interventions on depression symptoms at follow-up was not significant, although the intervention groups had nonsignificant lower depression scores at follow-up versus controls at follow-up, they noted.The studies measuring subsequent suicide attempts as an outcome did not significantly differ between one another, but studies measuring linkage to follow-up care and depression were significantly heterogeneous, indicating some interventions performed better than others, Doupnik and colleagues reported.In a subgroup analysis stratified by age, adolescents and adults who underwent brief interventions both had significantly higher chances of being linked to follow-up care and significantly lower rates of repeat suicide attempts compared with those who did not, they noted.Limitations of the review included the analysis of only English-language articles. Also, one study of 1,376 patients accounted for a large portion of the study population, and was therefore heavily weighted, and the sample sizes for studies measuring depression, and subsequent suicide attempts were small, so small study effects cannot be ruled out, the authors stated.If you or someone you know is considering suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

He was certain someone was stalking him; threatening messages seemed to keep appearing on screens around him. As his confusion — which is common among Covid-19 patients who have spent a long stint on a mechanical ventilator — dissipated in the coming days, Mr. Blueweiss began to take stock of his situation. He realized that he was in the intensive care unit at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, and that those screens were displaying his vital signs and medical updates.

Grocery store employees, nurses, bus drivers and other front-line workers who stayed on their jobs in the early days of Louisiana's coronavirus outbreak could receive a one-time $250 state payment, under a bill that started advancing Wednesday in the state House.
 Democratic lawmakers are pushing the hazard pay proposal — paid out of $50 million in federal virus aid from Congress — in an ongoing special session focused largely on business recovery from the pandemic. They're trying to broker a deal with Republicans who need some Democratic support to pass certain business tax breaks and other pro-business measures.
 The Ways and Means Committee sent the $250 hazard pay bill by House Democratic leader Sam Jenkins, of Shreveport, to the full House for debate without objection Wednesday, in a bipartisan show of support.
 "This committee has gone above and beyond to support our big business and our small businesses," said Rep. Matthew Willard, a New Orleans Democrat. "We have yet to do anything for the working people of Louisiana. While some had the luxury of staying home and protecting their health and safety, others ... did not have that choice."
 Jenkins said the state should offer aid to grocery store workers, nurses, janitors, nursing home employees, bus drivers, EMS workers, fire and rescue employees, sanitation workers and others who risked their health to keep businesses operating during Louisiana's stay-at-home order.
 "We do believe that these funds will immediately go back into our local economies. We think it will be a stimulus," Jenkins said. "We feel like this is an immediate investment into our economy."
 The $250 payments would be available to workers with an adjusted gross income on their 2019 tax return of $50,000 or less and who had to report to a job outside of their home for at least 200 hours from March 22 through May 14. They would have to hold one of the long list of jobs considered "essential critical infrastructure" under House Bill 70.
 The Department of Revenue would verify an applicant's eligibility, and the state's Board of Commerce and Industry would have to approve the applications before payments are made.
 But disagreement remains over how to fund the $50 million in payments, raising questions about whether a deal can be reached before the special session must end June 30.
 Republican legislative leaders want to take the money from more than $500 million in federal aid set aside to reimburse local governments for expenses responding to the virus outbreak. Democrats want the dollars to come from $300 million in federal aid earmarked for small business grants.
 The House committee adopted language by Rep. John Stefanski, a Crowley Republican, that targets the local government assistance money to pay for the $250 one-time supplement for workers.
 "I want to make sure that our small businesses are protected as well," Stefanski said.
 Willard said local governments are "in dire need" of assistance to help with their virus-related expenses.
 "I promise that I will try to find a compromise," Stefanski told Willard.

Over the past six months, the Ravens have done what seemingly only the Ravens can do: They’ve made Edwards’ 2020 target more realistic while raising questions about his role in that lofty pursuit. In drafting Ohio State’s J.K. Dobbins, they reinforced one of the NFL’s top running back rooms and threw its pecking order into flux. Edwards was third in the league in rushing average last season. Now he might be third on the Ravens’ depth chart.
 “I can’t say that I’m not looking forward to [the next season],” Edwards, who’s set to become a restricted free agent after this year, said in a video conference call Wednesday. “It’s a great opportunity that I’m in. I’m doing everything the same. I’ve always been a hard worker. I think that’s how I want myself to be remembered as — somebody that works hard. That’s what the team thinks of me. I’m going to be in a great position with a great team, a team that wants to run the ball. Everything is in front of me. I just have [to take] another step forward.”
