Theresa Greenfield is “hot under the collar” about remarks her opponent, Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, made two weeks ago about health care workers inflating the numbers of COVID-19 cases.
 “I’m upset ... frankly, I’m ticked off,” she told reporters Tuesday afternoon, because rather than supporting health care workers, Ernst “has been attacking them and attacking the health care that so many Iowans rely upon.”
 Nobody “grandstands” like Greenfield, who opposed coronavirus relief measures approved by congressional Democrats and Republicans, the Ernst campaign responded.
 Greenfield was referring to a comment Ernst made in Black Hawk County on Aug. 31 when responding to a person who said COVID-19 deaths were being overcounted. Ernst said she, too, was “skeptical” of the numbers.

"Bam. That seals the game for us," Butler said. "I love how he does any and everything that you ask him to do. I really do. You ask him to pass the ball, he does that. Score, he does that. Come up with a huge defensive stop, block, he does that. He's a huge part to our winning. I've been saying it all year long and I'll repeat it again."

DOVER, Del. (AP) — Transgender activist Sarah McBride won a Democratic state Senate primary in Delaware on Tuesday and is poised to make history as the first transgender person elected to the state's General Assembly. McBride, who interned at the White House during President Barack Obama’s administration, made history at the 2016 Democratic National Convention by becoming the first transgender person to speak at a major party convention. She later served as national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign. McBride defeated Joseph McCole on Tuesday to advance to the November general election. The Senate district in contention stretches from northern Wilmington to the Pennsylvania border, and has been held by Democrat Harris McDowell since 1976. McDowell, who is retiring and endorsed McBride, is the longest-serving legislator in Delaware history. Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district by more than 3-to-1, and McBride is the heavy favorite against Republican Steve Washington in November. If elected, McBride would join a handful of other transgender legislators around the country but would be the first transgender state senator. “I’m bringing my whole self to this race,” McBride told The Associated Press in an interview before Tuesday’s primary. “My identity is one part of who I am, but it’s just one part.” “I would be legislating based not on my identity,” McBride added. “I would be legislating based on my values and on the needs of my constituents.” McBride’s campaign has generated interest from around the country and more than $250,000 in donations, eclipsing fundraising totals even for candidates for statewide office in Delaware. McBride’s priorities include paid family and medical leave for all workers, reducing costs and...

Speaking about the national picture, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there would be "prioritisation" of tests for people with acute clinical need and those in social care settings as he acknowledged "operational challenges" in the system.
 He faced complaints in the Commons about people being forced to travel long distances or even enter false addresses in the hope of securing a test.
 But Mr Hancock told MPs the average distance travelled to a test site is now 5.8 miles as he defended the government's efforts.

GOSHEN — Masks and the mail look to play certain key roles in the upcoming general elections, each influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
 The issues were among the list of items the Elkhart County Election Board tackled during their meeting Tuesday.
 With Election Day looming Nov. 3 — driven by the presidential race, congressional races, state races, and a very nearly full ballot of contested local races — elections staff are working to ensure vote centers will be prepped with sanitary and social distancing measures. At the same time, county Clerk Christopher Anderson anticipates a record-smashing deluge of mail-in absentee ballots this year.

BOONE — When Appalachian State plays at Marshall Sept. 19, two App State coaches will have similar memories of the Thundering Herd.
 Offensive coordinator Tony Peterson was a standout quarterback for the Herd, and the Southern Conference Athlete of the Year in 1988.
 Then there’s App State head coach Shawn Clark, who grew up an hour away from Huntington, W.Va. He grew up in Charleston W.Va., and recalled to watching Peterson play for the Herd.
 “He was a legend,” Clark said of Peterson.
 The duo will team up in an effort to knock off the Herd in a non-conference showdown of the former arch-SoCon rivals. Kickoff is at 3:30 p.m. and the game will be televised on CBS.
 The Mountaineers are coming off a 35-20 win over Charlotte on Sept. 12. App State rolled up 308 yards on the ground and 512 yards of total offense. Two running backs —Marcus Williams (122 yards) and Camerun Peoples (102) — rushed for more than 100 yards.
 Clark was happy to dominate offensively despite the rain that fell during the game.
 “We had 29 first downs and 308 rushing yards, so those were the positives in the elements,” Clark said. “I wasn’t satisfied with turnovers and that’s something we work on a daily basis. We were 4-for-7 in the red zone and our goal is to be 100 percent.”
 Clark said both backs, who were banged up during the game, were at practice Sept. 14.
 “Cam Peoples is still being evaluated and we’ll have a better idea as the week goes on,” Clark said.
 Marshall, coached by Doc Holiday, got 307 passing yards from quarterback Grant Wells in the Herds’ lopsided 59-0 win over FCS program Eastern Kentucky Sept. 5. His favorite target was Broc Thompson, who caught five passes for 67 yards.
 Knowledge McDaniel led the Herd’s rushing attack with 93 yards on 14 carries. Brenden Knox added 85 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. Clark said Marshall is effective running and passing the ball offensively.
 “Coach Holiday has done a great job recruiting team speed,” Clark said. “They have an outstanding quarterback, and it always starts with the quarterback. He really shined against Eastern Kentucky and his offensive line plays the game the way it should be played. If we can stop the run, they have a vertical passing game.”
