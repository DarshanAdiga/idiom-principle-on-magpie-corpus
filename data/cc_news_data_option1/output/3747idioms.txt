The Emergency Cash Grant is also available to all households in the priority areas with a member who: (i) has a disability, (ii) is over 70 years, or (iii) is a woman heading a household. The priority areas were identified based on the level of impact of the blast as well as existing vulnerabilities of neighbourhoods. The four eligible groups were identified based on evidence that these groups have greater needs and vulnerabilities than other households. Households with vulnerabilities living in disadvantaged areas affected by the blast are highly likely to need support.

As politicians and their wives implicitly threatened the music industry and the First Amendment, the unlikeliest trio of musicians -- avant-garde composer Frank Zappa, hair metal howler Dee Snider, and safe-as-milk singer-songwriter John Denver -- passionately defended artistic freedom before the federal government, simply because it needed to be done.
 Despite the absurdist trappings, the PMRC hearings deserve a revisit on their 35th anniversary as a reminder that there's always societal tension between the principles of free expression and the limits of acceptable discourse.
 These hearings show how people with power can determine certain forms of expression to be vile, antisocial, and beyond the pale. History has proved these particular censors wrong, but history often repeats itself. That's why it's so crucial to always hold the line on defending the right to express unpopular speech.

By Edmund Blair
 BEIRUT, Sept 19 (Reuters) - A party founded by Lebanon's Christian president made a proposal to end a dispute that has blocked the formation of a new cabinet and threatened a French drive to lift the country out of its worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.
 The proposal, put forward on Saturday, involved handing major ministries to smaller sectarian groups in a country where power is shared between Muslims and Christians. There was no immediate comment from officials in Shi'ite Muslim groups, who have insisted they choose who fills several posts.
 Lebanon's efforts to swiftly form a new government have run into the sand over how to pick ministers in a country where political loyalties mostly follow sectarian religious lines.
 A Sept. 15 deadline agreed with France to name a cabinet has passed. Paris, which is leading an international push to haul Lebanon back from economic collapse, has voiced exasperation and told Beirut to act "without delay".
 The leader of the Free Patriotic Movement, the party founded by President Michel Aoun and allied to Hezbollah, proposed "undertaking an experiment to distribute the so-called sovereign ministries to smaller sects, specifically to the Druze, Alawites, Armenians and Christian minorities".
 The statement was issued after Gebran Bassil, the party leader and son-in-law of the president, chaired a meeting of the party's political leadership. Bassil is a Maronite, Lebanon's largest Christian community.
 Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib, a Sunni Muslim under Lebanon's sectarian system, wants to shake up the leadership of ministries, some of which have been controlled by the same factions for years.
 A group of former Sunni prime ministers backing Adib urged the prime minister- designate to press on with forming a government "as soon as possible."
 But the two main Shi'ite groups - the Amal Movement and the heavily armed, Iranian-backed Hezbollah - want to select the figures to fill a number of positions, including the finance minister, a top position often called a "sovereign" ministry.
 With the nation buried under a mountain of debt and with its banks paralysed, the finance minister will play a crucial role as Lebanon seeks to restart stalled talks with the International Monetary Fund, one of the first steps on France's roadmap.

New Delhi [India], September 19 (ANI): After the National Investigation Agency busted Pakistan-sponsored Al-Qaeda modules in Murshidabad, West Bengal, Union Minister Babul Supriyo on Saturday said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has made Bengal a safe-haven for "nefarious activities."   Supriyo said that Mamata "continues to play with fire with appeasement politics," after the NIA busted Pakistan-sponsored Al-Qaeda modules in Murshidabad, West Bengal and Ernakulam, Kerala and arrested nine terrorists on Saturday.   "Not surprised that 6 of the 7 Al-Qaeda linked terrorists arrested by NIA are from Bengal. For long Mamata Banerjee-led All India Trinamool Congress had made Bengal a safe-haven for all kinds of nefarious activities and she continues to play with fire with appeasement politics," Union Minister tweeted.   The NIA conducted simultaneous raids at multiple locations in Ernakulam and Murshidabad early morning today in which nine arrests were made, six from West Bengal and three from Kerala, according to the probe agency.   The NIA had received inputs about an inter-state module of Al-Qaeda operatives at various locations in the country who were planning to undertake terrorist attacks at vital places with the aim to kill innocent people and create terror.  
 Based on these inputs, the NIA had registered a case on September 11, 2020, and initiated investigations.   Large quantities of incriminating materials including digital devices, documents, jihadi literature, sharp weapons, country-made firearms, a locally fabricated body armour, articles and literature used for making home-made explosive devices have been seized from the possession of the terrorists.   According to the agency, preliminary investigations have revealed that they were radicalised by Pakistan-based Al-Qaeda terrorists on social media and were motivated to undertake attacks at multiple places including the National Capital Region.   The arrested accused include Murshid Hasan, Iyakub Biswas, Mosaraf Hossen (all from Ernakulam), and Najmus Sakib, Abu Sufiyan, Mainul Mondal, Leu Yean Ahmed, Al Mamun Kamal, and Atitur Rehman (Murshidabad residents).   The module was actively indulging in fundraising and a few members of the gang were planning to travel to New Delhi to procure arms and ammunition. These arrests have pre-empted possible terrorist attacks in various parts of the country.   The agency said that the arrested terrorists will be produced before the concerned courts in Kerala and West Bengal for police custody. Further investigation is underway. (ANI)

Stages are treated in a similar way. They’re stable in a sense that players will be able to judge how far they are in it based on a handful of level chunks, but the rest of it can vary. A certain section might look the same, but have different enemies, new hazards or a more sophisticated platforming challenge than it did before. King says the team is also mixing things up by offering players more “entropy conditions” and turning power-ups into choices. These entropy conditions are basically difficulty modifiers for levels or even entire runs. They can affect things like enemy health, enemy damage, player damage or even just outright put a death timer on the run. Playing with them on yields greater rewards, so skilled players will likely get some fun challenge out of them.

La saga “Crepúsculo” adquirió gran popularidad desde el estreno de su primera película en 2008. Esta producción permitió que jóvenes actores como Kristen Stewart y Robert Pattinson dieran el gran salto y sus nombres empezaran a sonar en Hollywood. Sin embargo, no fueron los únicos que llamaron la atención de los fans. En “Amanecer”, la última entrega de la saga, también hizo su aparición un personaje que cautivó al público. Se trata de ‘Renesmee’, la pequeña hija mitad vampiro mitad humano que tuvieron ‘Bella Swan’ (Kristen Stewart) y ‘Edward Cullen’ (Robert Pattinson). ¿Quién interpretó a este personaje? La joven actriz Mackenzie Foy. Desde su aparición a los 12 años en la última entrega de la saga “Crepúsculo”, la joven actriz se ha convertido en uno de los nombres más llamativos de Hollywood. Aunque muchos la recuerdan como la pequeña ‘Renesmee’, también ha formado parte de otras producciones que han marcado época para los amantes del cine. En el año 2014, Mackenzie Foy formó parte de la película “Interstellar” junto a un elenco de lujo encabezado por los reconocidos Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain y Matt Damon. Además, también ha tenido trabajos como modelo, carrera que empezó muy joven. Mackenzie Foy empezó su carrera en el modelaje en 2004, con apenas 4 años. A lo largo de su trayectoria ha trabajado para reconocidas marcas como Banana Republic, Garnet Hill, Polo Ralph Lauren y Guess Kids. En 2015, Foy se encargó de hacer el doblaje de la voz estadounidense del personaje animado de la niña en la película “The Little Prince”, basado en la obra homónica del escritor francés Antoine Saint-Exupery. Asimismo, en las próximas semanas, Mackenzie Foy reaparecerá en una nueva producción para la plataforma Disney+.

This firm has confirmed to KVIC that it has removed 140 links for various products that were being sold as 'Vagad's Khadi Products'.Further it said that there has been a steep rise in violation of Khadi trademark as the popularity of Khadi grew manifold in the recent years after the Prime Minister's appeal to buy these products.&quot;Exploiting this opportunity, a number of online sellers began selling random products in the name of Khadi. Also hundreds of stores mushroomed in different cities that were selling fake products,&quot; it said.It added that in recent months, particularly during the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a huge proliferation of such fraudulent online sellers. However, to enable online customers to buy genuine products, the commission has launched its e-portal.KVIC chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena said the commission has given violators the option of either stop selling products in the name of Khadi or legal action will be initiated for recovery of heavy damages.&quot;Legal notices have been issued to various firms essentially to safeguard the interest of Khadi artisans. This trademark violation has a direct bearing on the livelihood of our artisans who are making genuine handcrafted products,&quot; Saxena said.It has employed a dedicated legal team to ensure a systematic and continuous monitoring and takedown of unauthorised products being sold in the name of Khadi.KVIC is also educating all registered Khadi institutions engaged in manufacturing products that simply their registration with KVIC did not authorise them to re-authorize any one to use 'Khadi' trademarks or 'Khadi India' logo unless that firm or company obtains proper licence from KVIC for the same.Last month, KVIC issued legal notices to two firms Khadi Essentials and Khadi Global for unauthorisedly selling cosmetics and other products in the name of Khadi. &quot;KVIC has also sought damages to the tune of Rs 500 crore from Fabindia which is pending before the Mumbai High Court,&quot; it said.

Prayer candles with Ginsburg’s photo on them were also left on the steps.
 Several times, dozens in the crowd broke out into song, singing “Amazing Grace” and “This Land is Your Land” as others embraced one another and wiped tears from their eyes. At one point, the crowd broke into a thunderous applause — lasting for about a minute — for Ginsburg.

LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Carlisle United became the first English club to welcome back fans for a league match on Saturday as they took on Southend United in a League Two clash at their Brunton Park stadium.
 Up to 1,000 fans were permitted for the lunchtime kickoff, with Carlisle one of eight clubs to take part in a government pilot scheme to allow fans back into stadiums.
 Fans have not been allowed in the English Football League (EFL) or Premier League since the resumption of action in June following a three-month shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Two Championship (second tier) games were allowing 1,000 fans on Saturday with Norwich City hosting Preston North End and Middlesbrough taking on Bournemouth.
 Blackpool, Charlton Athletic, Hull City and Shrewsbury Town took the chance to be part of the pilot scheme in League One, along with Forest Green Rovers in League Two.
 However, a recent rise in COVID-19 infection rates across the country, which has prompted regional restrictions on movement, meant the government scaled back its pilot scheme to limit attendances to a maximum of 1,000 fans. It said plans for grounds to be up to a third full from Oct. 1 would be reviewed.
 Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the pilot schemes would help "build evidence" to see how larger groups of fans might be permitted to attend matches.
 Carlisle fans attending their match had to adhere to strict rules, including social distancing, hand-washing protocols and using face masks when moving around inside the stadium.
 Norwich City, relegated from the Premier League last season, used a ballot system to allocate tickets for their match. (Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Hugh Lawson)

_Belgrado, 18 set 10:05 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Il rappresentante speciale dell'Ue per il dialogo Belgrado-Pristina ha recentemente affermato che "è giunto il momento di completare con successo il processo di dialogo" dopo 10 anni. "Oggi sono esattamente 10 anni da quando l'Assemblea generale delle Nazioni Unite ha accolto con favore la disponibilità dell'Unione europea a mediare il processo di dialogo tra Belgrado e Pristina. È giunto il momento che (tale processo) venga portato a termine con successo ", ha sottolineato Lajcak. Nei giorni scorsi il presidente serbo Vucic ha affermato che sono stati aperti due nuovi temi durante la tappa di dialogo politico tra Belgrado e Pristina tenuta nella giornata del 7 settembre a Bruxelles. Il capo dello Stato serbo ha spiegato che i nuovi temi sono la comunità autonoma di municipi a maggioranza serba e le richieste per le proprietà immobiliari e le questioni finanziarie. Fra i temi discussi con il premier kosovaro Avdullah Hoti, ha aggiunto Vucic, ci sono anche quelli relativi alle persone scomparse e gli sfollati. I colloqui, ha ancora detto il capo dello Stato, continueranno il 17 settembre a livello tecnico e il 28 settembre a livello dei vertici politici. I negoziati, secondo Vucic, stanno affrontando le questioni "più difficili" per le quali ci sono i punti di vista più diversi. "In ogni caso, non sono insoddisfatto dell'incontro di oggi", ha sottolineato il presidente serbo. "Non appena verrà formato il nuovo governo (in Serbia) e il parlamento inizierà a lavorare a pieno regime, andremo davanti ai deputati per presentare il tema del Kosovo", ha aggiunto Vucic. Secondo il presidente di Belgrado, inoltre, il tema essenziale per la Serbia, che è stato discusso nel dialogo a Bruxelles, è l'economia. E' necessario, ha ribadito Vucic, rimuovere tutte le barriere e consentire la libera circolazione di merci, persone, servizi e capitale. (segue) (Seb)

Con i concorsi di progettazione abbiamo cercato di coniugare le opere pubbliche con la bellezza e la tutela dell'ambiente: dalla riqualificazione di Fibronit all'Ex Gasometro e Torre Quetta, dalla nuova Via Sparano, al ponte Adriatico e al water-front di San Girolamo, per citarne solo alcuni. Ora torno in campo al fianco del presidente Emiliano e per la prima volta affronto un'elezione, dato che allora mi fu affidato da tecnico l'assessorato ai LL.PP. del Comune di Bari.
