Delhi's air quality remained 'very poor' on Saturday morning and emission from firecrackers and calm winds may push it to the 'severe zone' by this evening, according to government agencies and weather experts.
 The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali is likely to be the 'lowest' in the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt.
 Pollution levels in Delhi during the Diwali period are likely to remain in the higher end of the 'very poor' category even in the absence of emissions due to firecrackers, it said.
 The air quality in Delhi-NCR is likely to deteriorate further and enter the 'severe' category by evening, it added.
   
   
 The city recorded an AQI of 373 at 10am on Saturday, which falls in the 'very poor' category. However, several monitoring stations, including at ITO (406), Alipur (422), Jahangirpuri (431), Rohini (403), Vivek Vihar (415), Narela (418), Bawana (430), Mundka (405) and Anand Vihar (429), recorded their AQI in the 'severe' category.
 The 24-hour average AQI was 339 on Friday and 314 on Thursday.
 This time, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said that a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali.
 Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said.
 V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said calm winds and firecrackers emissions may push the air quality to the 'severe' zone on Diwali night.  The wind speed is expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly, he said.
 There will be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said.
 The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases".

In early March of this year, they were still hoping to find more volunteer as well as local, state and federal help.
 “We’re not politically connected, we’re not country club connected — we’re just two old country people, like the ones who came along and founded this place,” George said in March. “Our vision has always been to see the inn preserved and saved rather than turned into a Taco Bell or whatever else someone might want to do. If you haven’t been here, you don’t really know and it’s just an inn. But it’s something that houses a building that was here in 1740. It should be, in our view, part of the national parks.”
 Now, working through a pandemic, the couple continues to hold out hope. They’ve been able to use COVID relief aid to keep things going and to refurbish some areas of the inn.
 Though business is down “significantly,” Becky said the Wayside Inn remains open Friday through Sunday for restaurant service. Lunch and dinner is served on Fridays, breakfast, lunch and dinner on Saturdays and breakfast only from 8 a.m. to noon Sundays.
 They’re working to accommodate groups and other gatherings, and folks can call for a reservation on other days of the week, Becky said. A reservation must be made.
 “We aren’t dealing with the capacity that we were before, obviously. Our bar is not open, but people can still have drinks at tables. So, we’re still serving beer, wine and spirits, but there’s no sitting around the bar and enjoying the camaraderie there,” she said. “Before, anyone could just drop in and see what’s going on, but now we have to have a closer count and pay attention to how many people we’ve got coming.
 “We do have events almost every day of the week by reservation,” she continued. “We have groups come in, like scrapbookers or family reunions. Even if someone wants to come in with four people and can make a reservation ahead of time, we can accommodate that even on days that we’re supposed to be closed.”
 The inn staff also plans to do a curbside Thanksgiving meal, offering individual meals or full Thanksgiving meals “with all the trimmings.”
 As the couple continues to walk the inn’s historic halls, serve both loyal customers and new guests and provide services for the community, they said they’ll do it with a smile.
 “We’re hanging in there. We really appreciate the support the community has given us and our customers who still come back over the years,” Becky said. “That means the world to us.”

PALMYRA, Mo. -- For the second time this season, Monroe City and Palmyra played an exciting back-and-forth game.
 Palmyra came out victorious for the second time, defeating Monroe City 26-22 at home on Friday in the Class 2 District 6 Final.
 "This is exactly the game we thought it would be," said Palmyra head coach Kevin Miles. "Monroe is a great team and we knew we had to play four quarters."
 The game started out with Monroe City receiving the ball and they got a strong opening drive going. Within five minutes, Monroe City's Ceaton Pennewell scored on a two-yard touchdown run.
 After a successful two-point conversion from Joshua Talton, Monroe City took an early 8-0 lead.
 Monroe City held Palmyra to a three-and-out on their first possession, and looked to be on their way to another scoring drive.
 Then, Palmyra defensive lineman Brayden Madden intercepted a pass from Monroe City quarterback Kyle Hays.
 "It was huge," Miles said. "You can't say enough about Brayden Madden and the things he did there. He's a great player and ... it was his time to shine. He made a great play when we needed him to."
 Madden's inteception set up a 35-yard touchdown run by Palmyra running back Ross Arch. Palmyra failed to convert a two-point conversion, but narrowed Monroe City's lead to 8-6.
 "I think it showed that we still had energy," Madden said. "It got us in good scoring position. Every time you can make big plays on both sides of the ball, you're going to win."
 On Monroe City's next possesion, the Palmyra defense came through again. Weston King and Josh Lickfield sacked Hays to force a Monroe City punt.
 On Palmyra's next possesion, quarterback Brody Lehenbauer threw a 38-yard pass to Collin Arch. This pass set up a one-yard touchdown run to give Palmyra a 12-8 lead near the end of the first quarter.
 Hays threw his second interception of the game early in the second quarter to Collin Arch when Monroe City was threatening to score.
 "We made too many mistakes and hat's off to them," said Monroe City head coach David Kirby. "They forced a lot of mistakes. We are not taking anything away from them."
 Palmyra would capitalize on the turnover. Ross Arch immediately had a 51-yard run, which set up a 22-yard touchdown pass from Lehenbauer to Collin Arch.
 Lehenbauer said Palmyra was relentless in regaining momentum after falling behind early to Monroe City.
 "We definitely capitalized off of momentum swings," Lehenbauer said. "Brayden's interception, that was the coolest thing I think I've seen all year. We have to capitalize on other team's mistakes."
 Palmyra would enter halftime with a 20-8 lead and got the ball to start the second half.
 "We came into halftime with the mindset that we knew we weren't going to leave, said Monroe City wide receiver Logan Buhlig. "We were down 20-8, so one score and we were back in the game."
 Monroe City's defense came through to stop Palmyra on their first second half possession when defensive lineman Cecil Masterson sacked Lehenbauer.
 Hays would then throw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Buhlig on Monroe City's next possession. After a successful two-point conversion, Palmyra's lead narrowed to 20-16.
 Midway through the fourth quarter, Lehenbauer threw his third touchdown pass of the night, connecting with Zane Meyers. The two-point conversion failed, but Palmyra took a 10-point lead.
 On a fourth down play, Hays came through with a 30-yard pass to Waylon DeGrave to keep Monroe City's hopes alive. Hays then threw his second touchdown pass to Buhlig, a seven-yard completion to narow the lead to four.
 Kirby said Buhlig is an All-State caliber wide receiver.
 "It's been a pleasure getting to coach him and he really stepped up and excelled this year," Kirby said. "He did a great job on every side of the football; offense, defense and special teams. He definitely left a lasting impact and we are going to miss him."
 Palmyra would clinch the victory when Zane Meyers recovered Monroe City's onside kick with less than a minute remaining in play.
 "It bounced just like we wanted it to, but Zane Meyers is a great player and made a great catch to seal the game," Buhlig said.
 Monroe City finishes the season 8-3 after losing the district final.
 "They just went toe-to-toe for the second time with the No. 1 team in the state and went 48 minutes of just fire," Kirby said. "I'm proud of these kids. I would had loved to be on the other end of the victory, but you know what, it just wasn't in the cards tonight."
 Palmyra (11-0) will play Hallsville in the state quarterfinals on Saturday, Nov. 21.
 "We felt like this is a special group," Miles said. "You can't say enough about them and the things they continue to do. They never cease to amaze me. They never let us down, every week."

The Trump Republicans have gone wading in the fever swamps and invited the creatures to the inner circle. We’ve always had conspiracy theories, but we’ve never before elected a conspiracy monger, and we’ve never before had the minority leader of the House of Representatives as well as a U.S. senator welcoming a fringe conspiracist (Representative-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene).
 In recent months, we’ve learned that 37% of Trump supporters believe that all or parts of the QAnon conspiracy are true, and that 34% of Republicans and Republican learners think the COVID-19 pandemic was intentionally started by powerful people (the figure for Democrats and Democratic leaners was 18%).
 Into that warm petri dish for incubating crazy thinking, insert one defeated Trump claiming voter fraud and you get yesterday’s new polling showing that 70% of Republicans do not believe the 2020 election was “free and fair.”
 The difference between 37% and 70% is the difference between a disturbing tendency and a potential crisis of legitimacy.
 About 72 million Americans voted for Donald Trump. If the vast majority of them believe — falsely — that the election was stolen from them and that their votes didn’t count, what does that do to any opportunity for national healing? How do they respond if the sitting president goes beyond filing frivolous lawsuits and urges state legislatures to submit alternative slates of electors (as Mark Levin has urged)? Or if he asks the military to take to the streets by invoking the Insurrection Act?
 Some object that Republicans who are indulging the president’s tantrum are merely playing for time and waiting for him to come to terms with reality. That makes no sense. By helping him to stoke the base’s paranoia, they are making it less, not more, likely that he climbs down off the crazy tree.
 No, the branch of Republicans that brought Trump to power is now attempting to poison the well for sane Republicans in the future. Instead of being able to focus on policy or (gasp) possible cooperation with the Democratic president on urgent matters like the pandemic, the narrative will be set by the grievance machine. The Trump crowds were still chanting, “Lock her up!” in 2020. Is there any doubt that they’ll be chanting, “Trump won!” in 2024?

Years ago (back in Aught-3), we had some big excitement on the farm. One day the phone rang and it was Pop. His voice had a hard edge on it that I don’t hear very often. “Mimi, you need to get your dogs in and lock the doors. There’s a convict on the loose.”
 Now for those of you who don’t know much about our family spread, I have to fill you in before we continue with the story. We all lived on the outer edge of a good-sized farm. I could cut through the woods at a brisk trot and get to any family domicile in about 15 minutes. But in between all those houses lies an unpopulated wilderness where cows and wild things live.
 First I called the dogs inside. Second, I located a sidearm and put it in close reach. Then I called Pop back to find out what was going on. He said that Mama had been on her way home from town and she passed the Latimer place, next door to ours. There were several patrol cars parked all around. A vehicle had been stopped on the road. Mama saw a woman had been apprehended but there were deputies “high-tailin” it across the pasture, toward our place. Our neighbor was standing out in the yard so Mama stopped and asked: “hi what was going on.”
 Apparently, a routine traffic stop turned into a police pursuit, right into our woods. They were bringing in bloodhounds. So mama hot-footed it home and spread the word. Pop called me and I got on the phone and called the neighborhood. I called everybody within a quarter-mile, mostly leaving messages on answering machines. I’m sure folks were mighty puzzled when they got home and wondered if their neighbor — the crazy dog lady — had finally gone right over the edge. But there wasn’t time to worry about what the neighbors thought. There was a bad man on the run!
 I sat down to wait for word. At one point, I could hear the hounds baying deep and hollow through the woods. Mama called with updates from Command Central. The deputies weren’t very forthcoming with information about the man they were chasing but were full of praise about how green our pastures were and told Mama what fine goats we had. Pop wanted to ride with them. He knows all the hidey-holes on the place. But the officers were moving on and I think there might e something in the rules about non-personnel getting involved in the chase.
 At this point, we lost sight of them. The cars moved away from the Latimer farm and headed to points unknown. So I waited for the news, enduring the stink of my three big yard dogs that were breathing up all the air in my tiny office. In a little while, Mama called back and said the suspect had been spotted again, heading toward Folds Road.
 One of our neighbors had been on her way home when she saw a man with a long, blond ponytail running for all he was worth out of the pasture, followed by deputies and bloodhounds. She was wondering if we knew what was going on. She also said she spied two other men trotting up the road away from the ruckus and wondered if they were mixed up in the chase. Mama told her there was just one suspect so we tried to figure out who the other two men were. I speculated if I’d been walking down Folds Road, minding my own business and I heard men yelling and bloodhounds baying, I would have probably made some pretty quick tracks myself.
 We were never sure if the suspect was apprehended. We just knew he was no longer in our neck of the woods. So taking a collective breath, we all stuck our noses out of our doors and peered suspiciously into the damp afternoon. The dogs blundered down the front stirs, frisking and fighting, stopping to sniff the anxious air. Then they started barking.
 That’s when I heard the plaintive cry, coming from up the road. Vesta was in their old white truck, yelling at the top of her lungs “Flo … Flo … here goat, goat, goat.”
 I stood on the edge of the road, peering through the misting rain. Vesta spotted me and pulled over. The dogs circled her truck, wagging tails and sniffing. “Goat’s gone.” She fussed. “Which one?” I queried. “ALL OF THEM!” She lamented. It seems all the excitement spooked the herd and they had taken off to worlds unknown.
 Darkness was looming in. The goats were lost and most of them were on the verge of having babies. So I piled into the truck and we went on our own high- speed chase. Bumping across the terraced fields, surging through mud-holes, we hunted high and low. Squinting through the new green of the woods, across the spring pastures, we searched for white patches.
 Finally, just about dark, we ran up on Pop driving his golf cart. He had spotted them, far on the other side of the farm. So Vesta and Pop took off with a bucket of feed and brought the lost goats home to safety. All was quiet on the Carroll County front.

 V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said calm winds and firecrackers emissions may push the air quality to the 'severe' zone on Diwali night.  The wind speed is expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly, he said.
 There will be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said.
 The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases".

When Antionette Brown first saw Henry Bell at a nightclub 14 years ago, she knew he was the one. Although they never married, they commonly referred to each other as husband and wife during that span.
 Nothing tore them apart -- not even when Bell nearly died after being hospitalized with Covid-19 for nearly two months.
 So one day before he was released from HCA Healthcare's Orange Park Medical Center in Florida, they finally decided to tie the knot in the hospital parking lot surrounded by the health care workers who helped save Bell's life.

The air was cold but spirits were warm in Kingdom City for the Class 2 District 5 final between North Callaway (7-3) and Hallsville (7-4). Attendance was unlimited, and both sets of stands were completely filled with bundled, cheering fans.
 Hallsville dominated on both sides of the ball and won 36-14. North Callaway's defense could not contain the Indians' run or passing attack. Sophomore running back Harrison Fowler scored once in the first quarter and helped his team work its way down the field and use up clock.
 Junior quarterback Tyger Cobb was poised in the pocket, throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to senior receiver Ryan Roberts and multiple 20-yard-plus passes to junior receiver AJ Austene. Cobb also ran for three touchdowns of his own and proved his versatility. He made the big plays that win games and had few mistakes, throwing just one interception early in the third quarter.
 The Indians' defense held North Calloway to one score in each half. The Thunderbirds struggled to convert in the red zone and turned the ball over four times. Hallsville coach Justin Conyers credits the fumble recovery at the end of the second quarter with changing the momentum of the game.
 "I think the fumble down here at the end of the first half when they had the chance to tie the ball game at 16 was key," Conyers said.
 Hallsville was relentless in the second half, outscoring North Callaway 20-6. Its defense suffered occasional penalties like pass interferences, false starts and horse collars, but the Indians still held the line and forced turnovers at crucial points.

It's that season! Yes, it's the holiday season, but it's also the "how do I get rid of the turkey leftovers" season. The recipes I'm sharing today are Chez Lolly-approved by family and friends.      LITTLE GOBBLER CROISSANT SANDWICHES   One of my social media friends told me about a sandwich that her mama served their family after Thanksgiving. It sounded amazing to me, and I decided to try it out for our family. We all love it!      • Croissants (cut in half lengthwise)   • Cream cheese (I used the whipped version so it will be easy to spread)   • Sliced turkey   • Cranberry sauce      Spread a liberal serving of cream cheese on each half of the croissant.      Pile on the turkey slices and then spoon over as much or little cranberry sauce as you'd like. Top with that other half of the croissant. Refrigerate until ready to serve.      TURKEY AND SAUSAGE GUMBO   It's a tradition in our family to have gumbo on hand for the busy weekend following Thanksgiving. Have all the ingredients prepared and ready to go. Once the roux is ready, you'll add all the veggies at one time.   • 12 to 14 cups turkey stock (preferably homemade)   • 1 cup flour   • 1 cup vegetable oil   • 1 large yellow onion, chopped   • 3 ribs celery, chopped   • 1 large green bell pepper, seeded and chopped   • 2 teaspoons chopped garlic   • 16 ounces package Cajun-style smoked sausage, diced and browned   • 2 to 3 cups chopped turkey   • 1 to 2 tablespoons Cajun or Creole seasoning   • 2 bay leaves   • Cooked white rice   • Chopped parsley   • Thinly sliced green onions      In a large Dutch oven (7 quarts), bring turkey stock to a gentle simmer.      In a large cast-iron skillet, add the flour and oil. Turn heat to medium high and, continually stirring, begin to make the roux. You must stir the mixture constantly so it won't burn.      When the roux reaches the color of peanut butter, add the onions, celery and bell pepper all at once and stir. The vegetables will cool the roux so that it stops cooking, and the heat from the roux will soften the veggies.      Lower the heat to medium low and let the vegetables cook for 4 to 5 minutes, frequently stirring. Add the garlic and let cook another minute or so.      Add the vegetables to the simmering stock. Next, add in the browned sausage and turkey. Stir in the Creole seasoning and add the bay leaves.   Bring the gumbo up to a gentle simmer and let cook for an hour or so. Remove the bay leaves before serving over cooked rice. Garnish with parsley and/or green onions.      CREAMY TURKEY AND WILD RICE SOUP   This recipe, courtesy of Food and Wine, was adapted from a chicken and wild rice recipe into a turkey and wild rice recipe.      • 4 tablespoons unsalted butter   • 2 carrots, cut into inch pieces   • 3 celery ribs, cut into inch pieces   • 1 medium onion, chopped   • 2 garlic cloves, minced   • 1 teaspoon finely chopped thyme   • Salt   • Pepper   • 1/4 cup all-purpose flour   • 1 cup wild rice (5 ounces)   • 2 quarts chicken stock or low-sodium broth   • 2 cups of water   • 4 cups bite-size pieces of roasted turkey (or chicken)   • 1 cup heavy cream   • Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish      Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, thyme and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Cook over moderate heat, occasionally stirring, until the vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes.      Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and cook, stirring, until evenly coated and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the wild rice to the saucepan and gradually stir in the stock and water.      Bring to a boil, then simmer over moderately low heat, occasionally stirring, until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.      Add the turkey (or chicken) and simmer, occasionally stirring, until the wild rice is tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Stir in the cream and season with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with fresh chopped parsley and serve.

India and Australia are set to renew their rivalry when they face each other in a full-fledged series that will last around 2 months. India will play 3 T20s, 3 ODI's and 4 Tests as they look to stamp their authority over their rivals. Last time India toured Australia, they managed to win the Test series for the first time in their history. But two of Australia's main batsmen were missing from action. David Warner and Steve Smith could not take part in the series as they were facing a one-year ban due to ball tampering.But this year, Smith is ready to face the music. He is looking forward to the competition provided by the Indian pacers. And Smith is not backing down from the challenge. Smith has dared the lethal Indian fast bowling unit to bring on the short stuff in the upcoming marquee Test series, saying he has faced a lot of it in his life.According to the former captain, trying short-pitched bowling against him could work in Australia's favour."If teams are trying to get me out like that it's probably a big benefit for the team because it takes a lot out of people's bodies if you continually bowl short," Smith told News Corp."I've faced a lot of short bowling in my life and I haven't had too many stresses with it. I suppose we'll just wait and see."Against New Zealand in the 2019-2020 season, Smith was dismissed by left- arm pacer Neil Wagner four times, as the Kiwi consistently attacked the batsman with short-pitched deliveries aimed at his body.Smith, though, still managed to average nearly 43 in the three matches and wore the bowlers down with his dogged approach in the middle, helping the others to pile on the runs."It's no dramas for me. I just play the game and sum up the conditions, how they're trying to get me out and being able to counter that," Smith said.He acknowledged that Wagner executed it well, but others may not be able to replicate that."I mean, a few different oppositions have tried it and they've certainly found it more difficult to (execute it) the way Wagner did. He's got an amazing skill set where his speeds go up and down... everything is between your ribs and your head."Indian play three ODIs, three T20s and four Tests starting November 27.

I’m not on Facebook, but I hear it’s a viral space where participants spar and war. Where a battle of wits and half-wits puts our divisions on display.
 Thank goodness there’s a place to air grievances and no one gets hurt, at least physically. Facebook reflects the diversity of opinion in America and provides a snapshot of how split the country is.
 The idyllic notion that America is a melting pot is a fantasy. Different people from different cultures from all over the world don’t move here and share thoughts and ideas that create one big new culture. We don’t become more homogeneous with different elements melting together into a common culture.
 At our best, America is like a salad bowl where cultures tossed together retain their flavors. At our worst, we’re a sizzling caldron where politics can’t be discussed openly without it turning into an argument. One area that throws heat under the caldron is race relations.
 Racial tensions go all the way back to the original settlers. The white European newcomers considered themselves superior to everyone else. That included the Native Americans who they would eventually take the land from. And the relations between white and Black Americans has never been a good one considering how Blacks got to this country in the first place. The doctrine of Manifest Destiny didn’t consider minorities.
 Political tensions rose after voters completed their recent marathon — the longest election night ever. After four days waiting for results we can’t even agree that the presidential election was fair. I throw a flag on that claim. Without evidence, the false narrative that the presidency was “stolen” is not only fake news, it’s an insult to thousands of county election supervisors, their staffs and bi-partisan Board of Elections that perform their jobs with the accuracy it deserves.
 Democracy depends on faith in our processes, and spurious claims of election day misdoings amount to sour grapes from sore losers. In fact, allegations of voter fraud and the offensive birtherism movement aimed at President Obama are pages from the same sinister playbook. Don’t be conned by reckless accusation.
 In the words of a spiritual, Mahalia Jackson sang, “There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole.” America needs a balm to heal our wounded country. We’ve sustained injuries from hate and discord. We’re broken by the COVID virus. There’s no cease-fire from our animus, no reconciliation for our grief.
 We need a national day of mourning to acknowledge our losses and pain and come together.
 Grief is universal. At some point in everyone’s life there will be at least one encounter with heartache. It may be from the death of a loved one, the loss of a job or the end of a relationship. We even grieve when our candidate loses a political race.
 Sorrow is personal. It’s not neat and doesn’t follow timelines or schedules. You may cry, become angry, withdraw or feel empty. None of these things are unusual or wrong. Everyone grieves differently, but there are some commonalities in the stages and the order of feelings experienced.
 In 1969, Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, a Swiss-American psychiatrist wrote in her book “On Death and Dying” that grief could be divided into five stages. Her observations came from years of working with terminally ill individuals.
 Her theory was originally devised for people who were ill. But these stages of grief have been adapted for other experiences with loss.
 The stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. First, you start to deny the news and, in effect, go numb. You believe the conclusion is somehow mistaken and you cling to a false, preferable reality. Anger may not be clear-cut fury or rage. It can mask itself in feelings like bitterness or resentment. An example of the anger stage is, “They’re terrible bosses. I hope they fail.”
 Where anger can feel very active, depression may feel like a quiet stage of grief. Acceptance is not necessarily a happy or uplifting stage and doesn’t mean you’ve moved past the loss. It means that you’ve accepted it and have come to understand what it means in your life now. Some voters need time to accept the results of the presidential election.
 The best campaign ad I saw on television used the voice-over of actor Sam Elliott over a simple piano rendition of the “Star Spangled Banner.” Elliott tells viewers that there is only one America and says, “No Democratic rivers, no Republican mountains, just this great land and all that’s possible on it with a fresh start. Cures we can find, futures we can shape, work to reward, dignity to protect. There is so much we can do if we choose to take on problems and not each other, and choose a president who brings out our best. Joe Biden doesn’t need everyone in this country to always agree, just to agree that we all love this country and go from there.”
 We all love this country. Let’s go from there and come together. It’s time to heal.

San Joaquin County will face similar regulations if moved to the lower tier next week, Park said.
 There are currently 12 counties in the purple tier, including Los Angeles, San Bernadino, Riverside, San Diego, Imperial, Tulare and Madera.
 Other counties in the red tier in danger of being moved to purple include Stanislaus, Merced, Fresno, Kings, Kern. A total of 22 counties are currently in the red tier.
 Six counties are in the yellow, or minimal transmission tier, including San Francisco, Mariposa, Calaveras, Alpine, Sierra and Humboldt.
 The remaining 14 counties in the orange tier include Marin, Alameda, Santa Clara, Napa, El Dorado and Tuolumne.
 Late Thursday, the Lodi Unified School District issued a statement about returning to in-person instruction next week.
 “We are aware that our county may revert back to the purple tier next week, based on the criteria outlined in the state’s Blueprint for a Safer Economy,” Superintendent Cathy Nichols Washer said. “According to the tentative agreement between LUSD and the Lodi Education Association, students will be on all-distance learning if the county is in the purple tier.”
 The district will provide an update to the community during the board of education’s Nov. 17 meeting, Washer said.
 The district was hoping to have students in the special day classes return to campus Nov. 19 in a hybrid capacity, with elementary students and some middle schools returning Nov. 30.
 Park and the county’s Emergency Medical Services Agency are again urging residents to continue wearing masks, keep a strict hand washing and hygiene regimen, stay home as much as possible, and get tested.
 “I think we can do it,” Park said. “I think this might be a wake up call, and it’s a sign we can’t let our guard down. We don’t move from into the red or orange or yellow tier just because we want to. We all have to work together to make sure we get there.”

The 8.3 is an adjusted rate, as the state is asking the county to test some 272 residents for COVID-19 a day. San Joaquin County has been penalized for only testing about 219 a day, Park said.
 The county needs to reduce its new daily case rate to less than 7 per 100,000 by Tuesday in order to stay in the red tier, she said.
 If an announcement is made Tuesday, many businesses and industries will be given three days to either cease indoor operations or reduce capacity to 25%, Park said.
 “If we do go back into the purple, it means businesses will have to revert back to purple tier rules,” she said. “We’re trying to revamp and surge testing upward as much as we can. It’s through testing that we might be able to get our volume up and not suffer penalties to our case rates. Then we can determine who is positive for COVID and isolate them.”
 In addition to increased case rates, Park said the rates of transmission was very concerning. The county had 28 people hospitalized with COVID on Nov. 3, and that number increased to 63 by Nov. 10.
 Park’s warning comes as the county reports 500 deaths from COVID-19 and 23,224 total cases since the pandemic began. There are currently 1,111 active COVID-19 cases in the county, she said.
 Sacramento County was relegated to the purple tier this week, and by Friday, businesses including restaurants and wineries, gyms and fitness centers, and places of worship were required to return to outdoor business and services only.
 All retail, libraries and shopping centers were required to reduce indoor capacity to 25%.

LONDON, NOV 13: Rafael Nadal says he is determined to improve his poor record on indoor courts as he bids to win the ATP Finals for the first time in his illustrious career.   Just one of the Spaniard's 86 singles titles has come on an indoor hard court, back in Madrid in 2005.   Nadal has earned a berth at the end-of-season ATP Finals every year since that year but has been forced to withdraw on six occasions.   Speaking Friday ahead of this year's tournament at London's O2 Arena, he said there were a number of factors for his failure to shine indoors, including fatigue at end-of-season events and a preference for other surfaces.   "We can find excuses or reasons but at the end of the day the numbers are the numbers," Nadal said.   "I think I have played less indoors than in other places without a doubt."   The second seed, who drew level with Roger Federer on 20 Grand Slams by winning last month's French Open final, said his game was not ideally suited to fast courts.   "The indoor surfaces have been not ideal surfaces for my tennis game since the beginning of my career," said the 34-year-old.   "I think I am able to play a little bit better the last couple of years indoors than what I did at the beginning of my tennis career without a doubt but that's the numbers and I can't say something different. I hope to change that this week."   Last week Nadal reached the semi-finals at the Paris Masters, where he was beaten by Alexander Zverev.    -AFP

A lethal Uruguay side inflicted a historic 3-0 defeat on Colombia in the ever- competitive CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers on Friday. Edison Cavani opened the scoring for the visitors in Barranquilla before Atletico Madrid striker Luis Suarez made it two and Darwin Nunez put the final nail in the hosts’ coffin. Yerry Mina saw red in the final moments to add insult to injury for Colombia.
 Uruguay is a small country but one well accustomed to making history as pointed out by Marca. La Celeste was looking for a response after a disappointing defeat by Ecuador in October and got it by consigning Colombia to its worst defeat on home territory in 82 years. The two-time World Cup winners applied high pressure combined with an attacking cohesion that left Los Cafeteros dazed and confused.
 Colombia’s two Everton players, Mina and James Rodriguez, formerly of Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively, were at fault for the first two goals, with Cavani and Suarez punishing them unforgivingly. Nunez, formerly of Almeria, was then on hand to put the cherry on top with Uruguay’s third – an indication of the tantalising blend of experience and youthful verve coach Oscar Tabarez has at his disposal.
 Mina’s red card capped a miserable day’s work for Colombia, who’ll need to dust themselves down and get ready to go again when they travel to Ecuador for Tuesday’s clash. Uruguay, however, will host division leaders Brazil on the same day with renewed confidence and enthusiasm.

Delhi's air quality remained 'very poor' on Saturday morning and emission from firecrackers and calm winds may push it to the 'severe zone' by this evening, according to government agencies and weather experts.The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali is likely to be the 'lowest' in the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt.Pollution levels in Delhi during the Diwali period are likely to remain in the higher end of the 'very poor' category even in the absence of emissions due to firecrackers, it said.The air quality in Delhi-NCR is likely to deteriorate further and enter the 'severe' category by evening, it added.The city recorded an AQI of 373 at 10am on Saturday, which falls in the 'very poor' category. However, several monitoring stations, including at ITO (406), Alipur (422), Jahangirpuri (431), Rohini (403), Vivek Vihar (415), Narela (418), Bawana (430), Mundka (405) and Anand Vihar (429), recorded their AQI in the 'severe' category.The 24-hour average AQI was 339 on Friday and 314 on Thursday.This time, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said that a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali.Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said.V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said calm winds and firecrackers emissions may push the air quality to the 'severe' zone on Diwali night.  The wind speed is expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east- southeasterly, he said.There will be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases".(With inputs from PTI)

WASHINGTON, Nov 13: President-elect Joe Biden cemented his U.S. electoral victory by capturing the battleground state of Arizona late on Thursday, but the official transition to his administration remains stalled as President Donald Trump refuses to accept defeat.   Biden was projected to win Arizona after more than a week of vote counting from the Nov. 3 election, Edison Research said. He becomes only the second Democratic presidential candidate in seven decades to win the traditionally Republican state.   Biden's win in Arizona gives him 290 electoral votes in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner. Biden had already cleared the 270 vote threshold to win the election, setting him on course to be sworn in on Jan. 20. Arizona's 11 additional electoral votes put any longshot challenge by Trump even further out of reach.   Biden also holds a lead of more than 14,000 votes in the uncalled state of Georgia, nearly certain to survive a manual recount. Nationally, Biden is winning the popular vote by more than 5.3 million votes, or 3.4 percentage points.   Trump, a Republican, has claimed without evidence that he was cheated by widespread election fraud, but his legal challenges have failed in court and state election officials report no serious   irregularities.   In order to stay in office for a second term, Trump would need to overturn Biden's lead in at least three states, having failed to find evidence that could do so in any of them. States face a Dec. 8 "safe harbor" deadline to certify their elections and choose electors for the Electoral College, which will officially select the new president on Dec. 14.   Trump's refusal to accept defeat has stalled the process of transitioning to a new administration. The federal agency that releases funding to an incoming president-elect, the General Services Administration, has not yet recognized Biden's victory.   Biden's pick for White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, told MSNBC on Thursday that starting the      transition is particularly crucial now, as the Biden administration will inherit a coronavirus vaccination campaign as soon as he takes office.    "The sooner we can get our transition experts into meetings with the folks who are planning a vaccination campaign, the more seamless the transition to a Biden presidency from a Trump presidency can be," Klain said.   Regardless of the impediments, Biden will sign a "stack" of executive orders and send high-priority legislation to Congress his first day in office, Klain said.   "He is going to have a very, very busy Day One," Klain said, citing a return the to Paris accord on climate change, immigration reform, strengthening the "Obamacare" healthcare law and environmental protection as issues Biden would address on Jan. 20.   Biden was set to meet with transition advisers again on Friday as he maps out his approach to the pandemic and prepares to name his top appointees, including cabinet members.   Most Republicans have publicly endorsed Trump's right to pursue court challenges and declined to recognize Biden as the winner. But more signs of dissension began emerging on Thursday.   Party figures such as Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu and Karl Rove, a top adviser to former President George W. Bush, said Biden should be treated as the president-elect.   Meanwhile, a number of Republican senators said the Trump administration should allow Biden to receive classified intelligence briefings, though they stopped short of explicitly calling him the winner.   The incoming commander-in-chief is typically given the briefings to ensure national security is not compromised during the transition.   "I don't see it as a high-risk proposition. I just think it's part of the transition. And, if in fact he does win in the end, I think they need to be able to hit the ground running," Senator John Cornyn told reporters.   The top House Republican, Kevin McCarthy, opposed the idea, suggesting Trump could still prevail.   "He's not president right now," McCarthy said of Biden. "I don't know if he'll be president January 20th."   Democrats have assailed Trump, and the Republicans giving him cover, for undermining the country's institutions. In an interview that will air on CBS' "60 Minutes" on Sunday, former President Barack Obama said Republicans were walking a "dangerous path" by endorsing Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud.   Biden has taken a measured approach, saying this week he viewed Trump's claims as "embarrassing" but insisting he was not worried about the impact on his transition to the White House. His legal advisers have dismissed the Trump lawsuits as political theater.       -REUTERS

The remaining two quarters were filled with the Falcons' smash-mouth offense which ended Centralia’s campaign for the district title.
 "When you meet back in December and you set the goals up, those goals are way out there," Blair Oaks coach Tim LePage said. "Once you start knocking those goals out you start to smell it and when you start to smell it, that next level play, it starts to get really intense and focused and that's where our guys are at right now."
 The third quarter opened with another passing touchdown for Hair with a connection to senior wide receiver Jacob Closser for 29 yards. The success in the air was all a part of LePage and his offensive coordinators' plan after watching film and noticing how good Centralia's run defense was. Hair went on to throw for seven touchdowns, while backup quarterback Jake Hagner reeled in his own 67-yard touchdown pass, putting the final nail in the Panthers' coffin.
 "I think we're still growing," LePage said. "There were a lot of things that we left on the table tonight that we're going to go back and watch on film. I just feel like our guys are excited to play ball, with this whole pandemic thing, our guys are just having fun playing ball."
 Blair Oaks will face off against Lutheran North (5-0) next week at 1 p.m. on Nov. 21.

India and Australia are set to renew their rivalry when they face each other in a full-fledged series that will last around 2 months. India will play 3 T20s, 3 ODI's and 4 Tests as they look to stamp their authority over their rivals. Last time India toured Australia, they managed to win the Test series for the first time in their history. But two of Australia's main batsmen were missing from action. David Warner and Steve Smith could not take part in the series as they were facing a one-year ban due to ball tampering.
 But this year, Smith is ready to face the music. He is looking forward to the competition provided by the Indian pacers. And Smith is not backing down from the challenge. Smith has dared the lethal Indian fast bowling unit to bring on the short stuff in the upcoming marquee Test series, saying he has faced a lot of it in his life.
 According to the former captain, trying short-pitched bowling against him could work in Australia's favour.
 "If teams are trying to get me out like that it's probably a big benefit for the team because it takes a lot out of people's bodies if you continually bowl short," Smith told News Corp.
 "I've faced a lot of short bowling in my life and I haven't had too many stresses with it. I suppose we'll just wait and see."
 Against New Zealand in the 2019-2020 season, Smith was dismissed by left-arm pacer Neil Wagner four times, as the Kiwi consistently attacked the batsman with short-pitched deliveries aimed at his body.
 Smith, though, still managed to average nearly 43 in the three matches and wore the bowlers down with his dogged approach in the middle, helping the others to pile on the runs.
 "It's no dramas for me. I just play the game and sum up the conditions, how they're trying to get me out and being able to counter that," Smith said.
 He acknowledged that Wagner executed it well, but others may not be able to replicate that.
 "I mean, a few different oppositions have tried it and they've certainly found it more difficult to (execute it) the way Wagner did. He's got an amazing skill set where his speeds go up and down... everything is between your ribs and your head."
 Indian play three ODIs, three T20s and four Tests starting November 27. The ODI and T20 series will be played in Sydney and Canberra from November 27 to December 8.
 The much anticipated Test series begins with the Day-Night Test at Adelaide from December 17.
 The Indian attack will comprise Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami in lead roles. The tourists will call on Ishant Sharma if he recovers from the side injury sustained at the IPL. Umesh Yadav and the promising Navdeep Saini are also part of India's Test squad.
 Smith was not part of the previous series between the two teams as he was serving his one-year suspension for the ball-tampering scandal.

BERLIN, NOV 13: Germany midfielder Toni Kroos feels that footballers are just "puppets" used by governing bodies FIFA and UEFA and are powerless in discussions about competitions such as the Nations League or a possible new European Super League.   "At the end of the day, as players we're just puppets for all these new things which are invented by FIFA and UEFA. Nobody asks us," Kroos said in his podcast 'Einfach mal Luppen'.   Kroos, who made his 100th appearances for Germany last month, is in the squad for Wednesday's friendly against the Czech Republic as well as Nations League matches against Ukraine and Spain.   The 2014 World Cup winner feels if players had more say they "wouldn't be playing in the Nations League, nor a Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, nor a Club World Cup with 20 or more teams".   The Real Madrid star said he feels such tournaments are planned "to suck out everything financially, and, of course, physically from every single player - and then some".   Last month, outgoing Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu claimed a European Super League could soon become a reality.   Kroos said a league comprising Europe's top 18 clubs would be "a very, very interesting thing in sporting terms" which would generate large television audiences, but it risks widening the gap between the continent's elite and the rest.   "It is also good to leave certain things just as they are when they are good," Kroos added, referring to the current Champions League, European Championship and World Cup formats as "top products".    -AFP
