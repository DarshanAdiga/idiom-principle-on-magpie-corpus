In Texas v. White in 1869, post-Civil War, the Supreme Court ruled that Texas entered an “indestructible union” upon admission into the United States, and therefore would remain part of the family. It’s also unclear if other Texans would be on board with such a drastic move.

But now, after Friday's inaction by the Supreme Court, Joe Biden is almost certainly going to be the next president of the United States, so we a) can have this kind of conversation and b) kind of _have to_ talk about all of this stuff, especially in light of the fact we just learned Hunter Biden is under investigation for possible tax improprieties that could potentially involve “China and other foreign nations," according to Fox News.

13of18Nurse Martina Papponetti poses for a portrait at her hospital Humanitas Gavazzeni in Bergamo, northern Italy, on Friday, March 27, 2020, in the file photo at right, and on Monday, Nov. 30, 2020. "Memories from these 8 months just pile up. Handwriting on the back of a photograph I deliver to a patient 'we are with you, come on mom' she signals to get physically closer, her caress on my hand, a tear on her face. I leave the room, and stop outside the closed door. No one can make it alone. You learn to have (apparently) courage for two and to convey it with gestures and attention. You learn to rely on hope beyond science, to forgive yourself for promises made that could not be kept. You learn the value of a smile and of a hospital discharge, which until a few months earlier were obvious. Those portraits freeze a moment nobody wanted to associate memories with. Then came the gratifications, the messages of solidarity and strength from anywhere in the world and in any language. Banners along the hospital walls ... perhaps today we too should be thanking whoever did it, because it made us feel less alone.Antonio Calanni/APShow MoreShow Less

In light of its launch in Ireland and around the world, DAZN’s partnership with Matchroom is pertinent to fans of Katie Taylor, who fights under Hearn’s company banner. As far as the undisputed lightweight champion’s future bouts are concerned, there are nuances to the shared broadcast rights between DAZN and Sky Sports which can be best summed up thusly: when Taylor fights in the UK (or in Ireland, which remains unlikely for the foreseeable) or on Sky Sports Box Office bills, it will be available to watch here only on Sky. But when she fights again in the States or elsewhere on non-pay-per-view shows, her bouts will be shown exclusively by DAZN, to which people in Ireland can subscribe for €1.99 per month (£1.99 p/m in Northern Ireland).

Filmmaker Guneet Monga says she is honoured to come on board “Jallikattu”, India’s official entry in the International Feature Film category at the 93rd Academy Awards, as an executive producer. Directed by Lijo Jose Pellissery, the Malayalam feature follows a tribe of men coming together to stop a bull that has run amok in their village.
 Monga, known for backing films like “Gangs of Wasseypur” series, “Masaan” and “The Lunchbox”, took to social media to share the news, saying she was thrilled to join the team ahead of its journey.
 “It’s an absolute honour to join team ‘Jallikattu’ on its Oscar journey. ‘Jallikattu’ blew my mind, it’s a high octane masterpiece! Lijo, you’re phenomenal. Let’s do this,” the producer tweeted.
 Last year, “Period. End of Sentence”, the 2018 short film on menstruation co- produced by Monga, won the Oscar in the Documentary Short Subject category.
 “Jallikattu”, which derives its name from the popular-yet-controversial bull- taming event in south India, is based on a short story by Hareesh.
 The film features actors Antony Varghese, Chemban Vinod Jose, Sabumon Abdusamad and Santhy Balachandran.
 “Jallikattu” had its premiere in September 2019 at the Toronto International Film Festival and received widespread critical acclaim.
 The movie was particularly praised for Pellissery’s spectacular directing effort, ably supported by Girish Gangadharan’s cinematography and Renganaath Ravee’s wild sound design work.
 Pellissery also won the best director trophy at the 50th International Film Festival of India last year for “Jallikattu”.
