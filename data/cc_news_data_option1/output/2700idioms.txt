2019 was the second hottest year on record since 1850 and this year is on course to becoming the hottest year ever. The Union government’s own climate change report has found that India might see a 4.4 degrees Celsius rise by the end of the century. When seen in tandem with some other recent studies, like the one from early May which talked about how the human climate niche is contracting due to increasing heat, the future looks grim.

“It’s not racist. It’s pride and it’s heritage so you’re wrong,” she said as the protesters amassed in front of her home.
 The protest was organized by Dave Coppock, who told the woman why people were outside the house with signs.
 “This flag was the symbol of the Confederacy. The Confederacy existed to maintain slavery. That was the point of the Confederacy ... to maintain and extend slavery into the Western territory, and that meant enslavement for Black Americans, forcing them into camps, splitting up their families, giving them no rights at all and keep treating them like property. That’s what that flag means, and that’s why we’re pissed off,” he said.
 The protest was peaceful. It lasted less than 30 minutes and the protesters began to engage with the woman before they started picketing, remaining on the public sidewalk except for a few in the group who lived in the house.
 One of the most vocal at the protest was Christopher Laro who said he was there because he knew there was a little Black girl who lived in the home and that she had to walk by the flag every day. Laro asked the woman repeatedly to take down the flag even for the day. Laro told the woman that if she was willing to remove the flag for one day, “you and I can hug, and we can make amends.”
 “You’re hiding behind hatred, and you know it,” Laro said.
 “I have no hatred of any race,” she responded.
 The flag had defenders. One woman stopped her car as she was passing and yelled out the window, “I like your flag.”
 Another woman, who would only say she was a neighbor and a friend, defended the woman and her flag, saying she should be allowed to continue displaying it because someone else in the house had put out a Pride flag. Pressed by the protesters to explain the connection, the woman said her friend was Catholic but didn’t ask for the Pride flag to come down.
 Mary Feldman, who lives on the third floor of the house near the Pride flag, also made a plea to the woman.
 “You’re my neighbor. I always say ‘hello’ to you. And that,” she said, indicating the flag. “... makes me feel unsafe. It makes all the people of color who understand the history feel unsafe.”

Close associates of former President Daniel Moi have received Sh1.4 billion for selling a majority stake in Transnational Bank to a top Nigerian lender.          Regulatory filings seen by the _Business Daily_ show the Nigerian tier one lender Access Bank paid the amount to close the deal for the Kenyan bank linked with persons who were close to Mr Moi, who died in February.          The closure of the deal now paves the way for Access Bank, owned by business mogul Herbert Wigwe, to inject additional capital in Transnational, which had 0.25 percent stake in December 2018, as it seeks a return to profitability.          The price is a discount given that shareholders’ fund-- the amount of money Transnational could return to shareholders if all assets were converted to cash and all debts paid off -- stood at Sh1.82 billion at the end of March.          Top owners of the 36-year-old Kenyan bank with 28 branches were companies owned by close associates of the late Moi, including Joshua Kulei, Simeon Nyachae and the former Vice President George Saitoti.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Ahmed Hamed has dreamt of rebuilding his pulverised home in Iraq's Mosul from the moment government forces recaptured the city from jihadists in 2017. But three years on, it remains a pile of rubble.          He is among tens of thousands of Iraqis who have filed claims to the Nineveh province's Subcommittee for Compensation, seeking reparations for material goods, injuries and even lives lost in the months-long fight to retake Mosul from the Islamic State group.          "I still haven't gotten a cent, even though it's been so long since the liberation," said Hamed, 25, who works menial day jobs to afford a small apartment.          His original home lies in Mosul's ravaged western half, where IS made its final stand in the city and reconstruction has been the slowest.          Iraq gathered $30 billion in pledges from international donors in Kuwait in 2018 to rebuild, but virtually none of the funds have been disbursed.          The lack of progress has been widely blamed on Iraq's infamous bureaucracy, corruption that has siphoned off reconstruction funds and polarised city politics.          Amid the novel coronavirus pandemic and plummeting oil prices, Iraq's government is struggling to rake in enough monthly revenues to break even –- pushing rebuilding even lower on its priorities list.          "Politicians keep telling us we need to go home," Hamed said, slamming the government's insistence on closing down the camps where more than one million Iraqis, rendered homeless by the fighting, are still seeking shelter.          "But how? Our homes are destroyed and there isn't a single public service that works."          According to a Norwegian Refugee Council survey in Mosul, over 270,000 people remain unable to return home and of those living there, 64 percent said they would be unable to pay rent in the next three months.          - 'Government is stalling' -          Every day, dozens of people queue outside a reception window at the Subcommittee for Compensation, clutching thick packets of multi-coloured forms they pray will be approved by the central committee in Baghdad.          Among them under the midsummer sun was Ali Elias, hoping for news of his son, a soldier kidnapped by IS in 2017.          "I filed a claim on him shortly after the liberation, at least so we know what happened to him. It was sent to Baghdad, but no one answered," the 65-year-old told AFP.          "I'm getting old and I'm exhausted by spending my life in these different government offices," he said.          According to subcommittee head Mohammed Mahmoud, the body has received "90,000 claims, of which about 48,000 to 49,000 were for goods, houses, shops and other properties, and 39,000 for human loss -- dead, wounded or missing".          "We processed three-fourths of the claims on material damage, but there aren't enough funds to actually pay them out. We were only able to compensate 2,500 families," he said.          Most of the rebuilding efforts in the northern city have either been undertaken by individuals or by the United Nations and other international organisations.          The UN has reconstructed 2,000 homes, dozens of schools, healthcare centres, and water or power plants in Mosul since 2018, but even it has faced challenges.          According to a recent report by the American University of Iraq in Sulaimaniyah, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) complained the "government is stalling or blocking projects rather than facilitating them".          Seeking to root out corruption, the UN introduced long vetting processes, which further delayed rebuilding.          - Dark past, grim future -          The report accused ex-Mosul governor Nawfal Aqoub of seeking bribes and kickbacks from reconstruction companies.          Even when a project was completed, authorities often failed to hire staff, wrote its authors Zmkan Ali Saleem and Mac Skelton.          The scandalous testimonies found an audience in Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi, who travelled to Mosul in June and promised things would change.          "I want to personally look at every contract for Mosul's reconstruction, so that we no longer see a single case of exploitation or corruption," Kadhemi said.          But the outlook remains grim.          Already, the housing and migration ministries were two of the worst-funded, making up two percent and 0.1 percent of cabinet's 2019 budget, respectively.          They were the only two ministries whose salary expenses shrunk that year.          "Baghdad has done too little in response to this catastrophe," said Muzaham al-Khayyat, who briefly governed the city when Aqoub was ousted.          Now, with the government facing a liquidity crisis, authorities are scraping together funds each month to pay eight million workers, pensioners and welfare recipients.           Barely breaking even, they appear unwilling to grow costs further by funding compensation or reconstruction.          "We asked the finance minister to set aside up to 20 billion IQD ($17 million) for compensation in Nineveh, but he hasn't approved our request," said lawmaker Mahasen Hamdoun, who hails from the province.           "Kadhemi promised a lot during his visit, but nothing was done."                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Nine months ago he was burned by corrosive liquid hurled during anti- government protests, but Hong Kong police officer Ling says he has no regrets and remains devoted to being a law enforcer.
 Officers like Ling have formed the spear tip of Beijing's pushback against huge and often violent pro-democracy protests in the restless finance hub.
 Seven months of clashes last year have left the city bitterly divided with swathes of the population loathing police -- and many officers feeling they have been unfairly vilified.
 Now the police have been given expanded powers under a sweeping new national security law imposed by Beijing that aims to crush the democracy movement once and for all.
 "It's undeniable that Hong Kong is part of China, it's reasonable to set up a national security law on Chinese territory," Ling told AFP in an interview at police headquarters the week before the new law was enacted.
 "Every law is a tool. Your decision to violate this law makes us enforce it," the 38-year-old added, asking to use a pseudonym because he feared reprisals from protesters.
 AFP's interview with Ling -- and a second officer struck last year by an arrow -- were arranged through the police force and a press officer remained present throughout.
 Over the past year police have arrested more than 9,000 people during clashes and demonstrations against Beijing's tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city.
 Rights groups accuse riot officers of routinely deploying excessive force during arrests, crowd dispersals and in detention.
 But police have rejected all allegations of brutality, saying the force has matched the violence shown by protesters. No officer has been fired for their actions.
 \- Dissolved skin -
 Ling has paid a personal price for his work -- his neck and chest sport a visible patch of twisted skin.
 He was struck by corrosive liquid on October 1 when unrest swept through the city on China's National Day. Others, including reporters, were wounded in the same attack.
 Ling's uniform dissolved in front of his eyes.
 The initial searing pain faded as his nerve endings dissolved.
 But the healing process was excruciating as they grew back, aided by five surgeries, including skin grafts.
 Ling, who returned to street duty in January, said he tried not to think about his attacker.
 "It would be a good thing if he was caught, but if not, it's meaningless to go down that blind alley," he said.
 Police say around 600 officers were injured in last year's protests. Last week an officer was stabbed in the shoulder during demonstrations against the new security law.
 At least 2,600 protesters and bystanders have been treated in hospital although the real figure is likely to be higher because many sought underground treatment, fearing arrest on wards.
 Hong Kong's police once dubbed themselves "Asia's Finest" and they continue to receive full-throated support from the local government, Beijing and those opposed to the protests.
 But in many neighbourhoods officers are insulted with graffiti and angry heckles.
 A survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute in May showed a record 44 percent of respondents rated the force's performance at "zero".
 \- Losing friends -
 Sam, a 40-year-old police officer and father of one, was struck in his leg by an arrow during some of the most intense clashes last year -- the November siege of Polytechnic University.
 "Protests always happen in Hong Kong but I had not imagined things would end with such violent scenes," he told AFP, asking just to use his first name.
 He described himself as politically neutral but said he tried not to think about the demands protesters make, instead focusing on his job.
 He said he was "disappointed" to see some residents now openly loathing police.
 "Some people misunderstand us, or they have not seen the whole thing clearly and are influenced by rumours," he said.
 "I try not to discuss with friends. It's very difficult to persuade one another."
 Ideological polarisation now permeates Hong Kong.
 Ling grew up in the working class district of Sheung Shui and said he wanted to join the police after he saw triad gangsters extorting locals.
 He said he remained proud to wear the uniform but that his social circle had changed -- especially after earlier student-led protests in 2014.
 "Quite a few friends drifted apart from me. They chose to put their political views and prejudice towards Hong Kong police in front of our friendship," he said.
 Link has asked family to keep his job quiet and keeps a low profile on social media.
 Many Hong Kong officers have opened accounts on mainland China's heavily censored Twitter-like Weibo platform where they are lavished with praise from readers -- and even professions of love.
 Ling found new online friends that way.
 "They left supporting messages on Weibo... That made me feel warm inside," he said.
 "I've got more friends, friends who I've never met."

And its cultural and culinary vitality make it worth more than just a pit stop.              About 250 miles northwest of Detroit and scattered among rolling farmland and hardwood forests, Traverse City has dozens of lakes and waterways, historic lighthouses, and ships and boats that travel its bay and inlets. Best of all, it has Lake Michigan in its backyard -- including the bucolic Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, where sand dunes tower up to 400 feet above turquoise-colored water.               "If you want to get away, get out in nature and spread out, this is the perfect place to do it," said Jillian Manning, public relations manager for Traverse City Tourism.              Traverse City also has become known for the quality of its wines (it has more than 40 wineries in the area) and craft breweries and is getting national attention for its imaginative local cuisine.               The town has much to offer in the way of museums, theaters, shops and galleries and is home to The Dennos Museum Center, which has the largest collection of Inuit art in the country.               Its climate has made it an ideal place to grow all types of cherries, but it's one of the leading producers of tart cherries in the United States, Manning said.               And cherries aren't the only crop this fruit-forward place is famous for growing. Because of its location along the 45th parallel, which is halfway between the North Pole and Equator, the region is ideal for growing grapes. It's at the same longitude of the great grape-growing regions of Spain and France, Manning said.               Traverse's agricultural bounty has made it into a rich culinary destination, with restaurants ranging from French to Vietnamese to farm-to-table to taco stands. This summer, Manning said, outdoor dining will be expanded to a two-block downtown area on Front Street (between Park and Union streets). The area will be closed to traffic and additional outdoor seating has been added so diners can properly practice social distancing.               Two downtown architectural and historical gems are the State Theatre and the City Opera House. The State, built in the early 1900s, was the first in Traverse City to offer a "talkie film" and features the annual Traverse City Film Festival, hosted by filmmaker Michael Moore. This year it was canceled because of COVID-19.              The 1891 Victorian, brick opera house -- one of 50 opera houses built in Michigan in the 19th century -- is one of a handful that are still standing. It was closed in 1920 but fully restored in 2005 and hosts concerts, dance performances and appearances by noted writers.               The Grand Traverse Commons -- a complex of galleries, shops, restaurants and residential areas housed in pale yellow, Victorian-Italianate buildings built in 1885 -- is surrounded by meadows and forests and was once a state mental hospital.
