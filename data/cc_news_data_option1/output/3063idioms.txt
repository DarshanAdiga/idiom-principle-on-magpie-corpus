“Please accept this letter as proposal for specific solutions and as an expression of support, both corporately and individually, for the work done by the Arizona Interscholastic Association towards the matters related to the suspensions, delays and commencement of fall sports activities.”
 The proposed plan by the AzFCA involves an Oct. 2 start date for all varsity competition. Junior Varsity and freshman competition would start on Oct. 1 and Sept. 30, respectively.
 According to the proposal, this would allow schools adequate time to prepare for the start of the season in accordance to the AIA’s heat acclimatization protocol, which calls for a 14-day period before athletes can be cleared for competition. This also allows every school to go adhere to its own respective return-to-play policy surrounding the pandemic.
 The current start date for official practices is set for Aug. 17, with games set to begin on Sept. 11. However, there’s rising concern from across the state most teams will not be ready.
 Brophy announced in July it would not advance to the second phase of its return-to-play plan until early September. Tucson schools have yet to conduct summer workouts. Most East Valley schools, however, are back on the field and some are able to use footballs.
 The AzFCA believes pushing the start date back to Oct. 2 would allow schools the adequate time to prepare for competition.
 “Although the many school districts represented in the AzFCA membership have issued varying rules within their districts, the proposed October 2 date of first varsity competition appears to provide the schools with the sufficient opportunity to comply district guidelines and adequately prepare their teams for a full competition season,” the letter said.

Cases have continued to rise — steadily in Indiana and specifically in Marion County, where the speedway is located — and Penske told The Associated Press on Tuesday the reversal on the spectator policy was "the toughest business decision I've ever made in my life.""We didn't buy the Speedway for one year, we bought it for generations to come, and it's important to our reputation to do the right thing," Penske said in a telephone interview.He said the financial ramifications of not hosting spectators — which even at 25% capacity, the mammoth facility could have held about 80,000 people — played no part in his decision. Rather, the continued increase of COVID-19 cases in Marion County made shutting out spectators the responsible decision."We need to be safe and smart about this," Penske said. "Obviously we want full attendance, but we don't want to jeopardize the health and safety of our fans and the community. We also don't want to jeopardize the ability to hold a successful race."As part of the plan introduced two weeks ago for 25% of fan capacity, spectators who had purchased badges that granted them access to the garage and pit lane was going to be permitted, as well as infield access. Although the speedway, which can hold at least 350,000 spectators, has the space for social distancing, Penske did not want to put fans or competitors at risk.The situation was compounded last week when IU Health, the state's largest health care system and a partner of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, said it opposed fans attending the 500."Until we sustain better control of this virus and its spread," IU Health said in a statement, "we strongly encourage IMS to consider an alternative to running the Indy 500 with fans in August."The letter blindsided speedway officials, who had worked with health officials on the comprehensive safety plan that included mandatory wearing of masks at all times inside the speedway.IU Health said it "appreciates" the speedway's safety plan, but risks remained too high to host a large cluster of fans."We have concerns about the risks of infection beyond the scope of the IMS plan, including social gatherings, travel, restaurants, bars, accommodations and other event-related activities," IU Health said. "This could lead to a spike in COVID-19 infections as we continue to see cases and hospitalizations increase every day."Penske said the IU Health letter was "disappointing" but did not force his hand. Instead, it simply came down to metrics of how the coronavirus is spreading through Indiana."The number of cases in Marion County has tripled while the positivity rate has doubled. We said from the beginning of the pandemic we would put the health and safety of our community first, and while hosting spectators at a limited capacity with our robust plan in place was appropriate in late June, it is not the right path forward based on the current environment," the speedway said in a statement.The first inkling that Penske's group was waffling came Monday when the speedway confirmed to the AP that the opening day of practice scheduled for next Tuesday had been scrapped. The first day of practice will now be Aug. 12. The only other change to the schedule right now is the elimination of the Pit Crew Competition traditionally held on Carb Day, two days before the race.The pandemic has obliterated the IndyCar schedule, with the series shutting down just two days before its March 15 scheduled season-opener. The schedule has undergone numerous alterations since, with a West Coast swing to Portland and Laguna Seca canceled last week and doubleheaders added to Mid- Ohio, Gateway in St. Louis and the road course at Indianapolis. Then, days after announcing the latest schedule updates, the Mid-Ohio events scheduled for this coming weekend were postponed. IndyCar has run just six events since the season resumed June 6. Limited spectators have been allowed at doubleheaders at Road America in Wisconsin and at Iowa Speedway, where Penske had to be the race promoter for the event to be held.Penske, just the fourth owner of national landmark IMS, has spent roughly $15 million on renovations to the historic property that he eagerly awaited showcasing for fans. His doubleheader weekend with IndyCar and NASCAR in July was held without fans and access to the property was limited to the competitors inside the facility.He said "the place looks even 50% percent better than it did in July" and takes solace that the IndyCar paddock will be able to get a closer look at the upgrades when the track opens next week. As for fans? “Look, this is a long- term investment for us for many generations to come,” he said. “We will continue to improve the speedway, the competitors will get to see it over the next two weeks and we believe this decision now regarding the 500 is in the best interest of protecting the 500 for the future.” Copyright 2020 Gray Media Group, Inc.

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], Aug 4 (ANI): Maharashtra Tourism and Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Commissioner Iqbal Chahal visited the areas affected due to heavy rains in the city on Tuesday.   They visited areas near ONGC, Bandra East, Milan Subway, Andheri Subway, Kurla's Kranti Nagar area, Gandhi Market, Matunga, King's Circle and Dadar Hindmata to take a stock of the situation.   Thackeray later made a series of tweets and said that BMC Mayor, Commissioner and other officials were on ground to ensure that the work in Mumbai runs smoothly.   "Took stock of the situation at Gandhi Market, Matunga and King's Circle with BMC Commissioner I S Chahal Ji. Perhaps for the first time after July 2005, Mumbai has experienced such heavy rains in a 12 hour span," he said.   "Also visited Dadar Hindmata where water is being pumped out from low lying waterlogged areas. Hindmata alone received 198mm of rainfall in just 5 hours," he added.   Thackeray said he also visited the Worli pumping station. "Work is on in full swing to drain out water from waterlogged areas. BMC Mayor, Commissioner, officers, staff are all on ground to ensure that the work in Mumbai runs smoothly," he said.   Earlier on Tuesday BMC Commissioner told ANI that Mumbai recorded 230 mm rainfall in 10 hours of incessant rainfall. (ANI)

RGV FC TOROS VS FC TULSA TO BE PLAYED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

It was in June that Larian Studios said it was targeting August for an early access launch, but that goal always had a big "maybe" attached to it. The trailer above tempered expectations for the launch window from the start. In an accompanying community update, Swen Vincke, founder of Larian Studios, said the team was shooting for August but that there were a few things that might prevent that from happening. Some of the work still being done on the game included performance captures which required physical bodies in a room to record, a process complicated by restrictions and precautions in place because of the coronavirus pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Vincke will be present during the _Baldur 's Gate 3 _announcements set for August 18th alongside others from Larian Studios to share more news on the game. It'll take place at 10 a.m. PT on that day for those who are interested in seeing what comes of it, but you can bet the highlights will be shared online afterwards regardless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           _Baldur 's Gate 3 _does not yet have a release date, but that will change on August 18th when we hear more about the game from the developers.

As the cherry on top, "Keigo Atobe" answered questions about his involvement in the ad while in-character. When asked how the "filming" the commercial went, the fictional character responded: "It was my first time doing filming for a commercial, but it was more straightforward than I expected. I thought it would be somewhat harder. Oh well, I can do this much no sweat. It was a rather good experience. In the ad, I appear as the 'Spirit of Miloha' in the form of a cow, and it really made me think that there's nothing in this world that doesn't look good on me."

The letter to Hines and the AIA outlined what the 2020 season would look like with the proposed timeline.
 The AzFCA is calling for an eight-game season that would eliminate the Thanksgiving by week. Playoffs would begin Dec. 4 and conclude with championship games on Dec. 18 and 19.
 Playoffs for each conference and the Open Division would consist of eight teams. Programs who do not qualify for the playoffs would be granted the opportunity to schedule a postseason game against another non-qualifier.
 According to the letter, there was support among coaches to host the playoff and championship games at high school venues if scheduling conflicts arise with other large venues in the state. Previously, championship games have been held at State Farm Stadium, Sun Devil Stadium and University of Arizona Stadium. The 4A championship last year between Mesquite and Desert Edge was held at Willow Canyon High School, which was met with backlash from coaches, fans and players.
 But due to the current circumstances, coaches with stadiums capable of hosting postseason games would offer their field for use.
 “There is complete support for scheduling playoff and championship games in high school venues to streamline the scheduling control, maintaining budget integrity, and offering the AIA flexibility to bring the best championship series under difficult circumstances,” the letter stated.
 “Each coach representing a home stadium site sufficient to host a playoff game agreed to offer their stadium and staff for playoff competition under the AIA’s normal and customary reservation procedures.”
 Hines has said the AIA is exploring all options for the 2020 season, including further delaying it to October. The proposal from the AzFCA outlines a possible outcome should the status of the pandemic in the state improve and allow for contact sports to resume. Though it would likely result in the delay of the winter sports season, which is tentatively scheduled to begin Nov. 24 for most teams.
 The AIA recently sent out surveys to member schools about the potential start of fall sports. The association’s Crisis Management Committee planned to meet Tuesday to review survey results. The executive board is scheduled to have a special meeting on Wednesday.

Of course, Paramount has been hurt most of all by the new normal over the last five years, as IP and marquee characters have replaced movie stars and high-concepts as the only thing getting audiences off the couch and into a theater. Where once the likes of Sony and Paramount thrived via star-driven originals and high-concept flicks (“Tom Cruise as a sports agent, “Will Smith as a benevolent pick-up artist,” “Harrison Ford is an ass-kicking president” or “Adam Sandler adopts a kid”), now audiences only care about established franchises with previously established marquee characters.

Roger Penske has reversed course and decided not to allow fans at the Indianapolis 500 later this month. The 104th running of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” will be the first without spectators, who showed up at Indianapolis Motor Speedway every year, even during the Great Depression.
 It was a flip for Penske, who purchased the iconic speedway in January and has spent every day since upgrading his new showplace to prepare for his favourite race. The pandemic forced the race to change dates for the first time, from Memorial Day weekend to Aug. 23.
 Penske had initially said he wouldn't run the 500 without fans. But as the pandemic continued to spread across the nation, the decision was made to limit capacity to 50%. The speedway then lowered that number to 25% and presented an 88-page manual on how to safely host spectators.
 Cases have continued to rise — steadily in Indiana and specifically in Marion County, where the speedway is located — and Penske told The Associated Press on Tuesday the reversal on the spectator policy was “the toughest business decision I've ever made in my life.”
 “We didn't buy the Speedway for one year, we bought it for generations to come, and it's important to our reputation to do the right thing,” Penske said in a telephone interview.
 He said the financial ramifications of not hosting spectators — which even at 25% capacity, the mammoth facility could have held about 80,000 people — played no part in his decision. Rather, the continued increase of COVID-19 cases in Marion County made shutting out spectators the responsible decision.
 “We need to be safe and smart about this,” Penske said. “Obviously we want full attendance, but we don't want to jeopardize the health and safety of our fans and the community. We also don't want to jeopardize the ability to hold a successful race.”
 As part of the plan introduced two weeks ago for 25% of fan capacity, spectators who had purchased badges that granted them access to the garage and pit lane was going to be permitted, as well as infield access. Although the speedway, which can hold at least 350,000 spectators, has the space for social distancing, Penske did not want to put fans or competitors at risk.
 The situation was compounded last week when IU Health, the state’s largest health care system and a partner of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, said it opposed fans attending the 500.
 “Until we sustain better control of this virus and its spread,” IU Health said in a statement, “we strongly encourage IMS to consider an alternative to running the Indy 500 with fans in August.”
 The letter blindsided speedway officials, who had worked with health officials on the comprehensive safety plan that included mandatory wearing of masks at all times inside the speedway.
 IU Health said it “appreciates” the speedway's safety plan, but risks remained too high to host a large cluster of fans.
 “We have concerns about the risks of infection beyond the scope of the IMS plan, including social gatherings, travel, restaurants, bars, accommodations and other event-related activities,” IU Health said. “This could lead to a spike in COVID-19 infections as we continue to see cases and hospitalizations increase every day.”
 Penske said the IU Health letter was “disappointing" but did not force his hand. Instead, it simply came down to metrics of how the coronavirus is spreading through Indiana.
 “The number of cases in Marion County has tripled while the positivity rate has doubled. We said from the beginning of the pandemic we would put the health and safety of our community first, and while hosting spectators at a limited capacity with our robust plan in place was appropriate in late June, it is not the right path forward based on the current environment,” the speedway said in a statement.
 The first inkling that Penske's group was waffling came Monday when the speedway confirmed to the AP that the opening day of practice scheduled for next Tuesday had been scrapped. The first day of practice will now be Aug. 12. The only other change to the schedule right now is the elimination of the Pit Crew Competition traditionally held on Carb Day, two days before the race.
 The pandemic has obliterated the IndyCar schedule, with the series shutting down just two days before its March 15 scheduled season-opener. The schedule has undergone numerous alterations since, with a West Coast swing to Portland and Laguna Seca cancelled last week and doubleheaders added to Mid-Ohio, Gateway in St. Louis and the road course at Indianapolis.
 Then, days after announcing the latest schedule updates, the Mid-Ohio events scheduled for this coming weekend were postponed. IndyCar has run just six events since the season resumed June 6. Limited spectators have been allowed at doubleheaders at Road America in Wisconsin and at Iowa Speedway, where Penske had to be the race promoter for the event to be held.
 Penske, just the fourth owner of national landmark IMS, has spent roughly $15 million on renovations to the historic property that he eagerly awaited showcasing for fans. His doubleheader weekend with IndyCar and NASCAR in July was held without fans and access to the property was limited to the competitors inside the facility.
 He said “the place looks even 50% per cent better than it did in July” and takes solace that the IndyCar paddock will be able to get a closer look at the upgrades when the track opens next week. As for fans?
 “Look, this is a long-term investment for us for many generations to come,” he said. “We will continue to improve the speedway, the competitors will get to see it over the next two weeks and we believe this decision now regarding the 500 is in the best interest of protecting the 500 for the future.”

"I remember him when he was 8 years old, and I was slightly older in karting, and I think his comments are absolutely valid and in the end he knows what it's like because he's living it. And we've got to take on board the fact that his experiences are real experiences. That's why, as much as he is one of the few successful black drivers, we've got to take a board what his experiences have been to make sure that we can make it better for the next generation.
