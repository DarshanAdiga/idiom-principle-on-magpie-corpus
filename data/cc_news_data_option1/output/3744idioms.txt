MIAMI (AP) — A hurricane watch was in effect early Saturday for coastal Texas as Tropical Storm Beta gains strength in the Gulf of Mexico during an exceptionally busy Atlantic hurricane season.Beta was 310 miles (500 kilometers) east of the mouth of the Rio Grande with maximum sustained winds at 60 mph (95 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. Forecasters said the storm was expected to become a hurricane on Sunday.The hurricane watch was issued from Port Aransas, Texas, to High Island, Texas. Also in effect were a storm surge watch from Port Mansfield, Texas to High Island; and a tropical storm watch from south of Port Aransas to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and east of High Island to Morgan City, Louisiana.Forecasters were predicting up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) of storm surge along parts of the Texas coast that included Baffin Bay, Corpus Christi Bay, Galveston Bay and more. Wind, heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions were also expected with the storm.Forecasters&nbsp;ran out of traditional storm names&nbsp;on Friday, forcing the use of the Greek alphabet for only the second time since the 1950s.Alpha was a post-tropical cyclone Friday night after bringing rain to Portugal. Tropical Storm Wilfred remained at sea but was 830 miles (1,340 kilometers) west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands with maximum sustained winds at 40 mph (65 kph).Meanwhile, Hurricane Teddy remained a powerful hurricane into Saturday, with maximum sustained winds at 130 mph (215 kph). Teddy was centered 695 miles (1,120 kilometers) southeast of Bermuda less than a week after&nbsp;Hurricane Paulette&nbsp;made landfall in the wealthy British territory. Large swells from Teddy were forecast to impact the Lesser Antilles, the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas, and later Saturday were to spread to Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast.Parts of the Alabama coast and Florida Panhandle were still reeling from the effects of&nbsp;Hurricane Sally,&nbsp;which roared ashore on Wednesday. At least two deaths were blamed on the system, and hundreds of thousands of people were still without power late Friday.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

During his first tenure in New England, Nguyen appeared in at least 30 matches during each of the 2012-’17 seasons.
 “I think Bruce knew before he traded for me what I can bring to the team,” Nguyen said. “And with all the weapons on this team, I’m thrilled to be able to come and be a part of this system.”
 Arena saw glimpses of some of the former greatness that Nguyen brought to New England. “You could see his experience and his quality on the field. We need to be smart about his minutes right now, but he looks like he’s going to be a good addition to our team.
 “We’re going to be smart about this. We’re not going to make any bold predictions at this point about how he’s going to fit in. But I do believe he’s going to fit in and fit in well.
 “His agent reached out to us a week or two ago. We had an interest and we were fortunate we were able to piece together a deal. He’s been a very good player in the league. I still think he has enough to help our roster. When I was in LA, I saw him play with LAFC and I still thought he was a very good player, and I still think he is.
 “He’s a proven player in the league, he has a history of scoring goals, of being a playmaker – that’s something I think our team can certainly utilize.”
 The Texas native was New England’s first pick, the second overall taken in the 2012 MLS Draft, and he became the club’s MVP that season, starting 27 matches and scoring five goals.
 New England certainly needs more forward motion, having scored just 10 goals in 11 matches (3-3-5).
 New York City FC is on a five-match (4-0-1) win streak, including a 2-0 decision over New England in early August. Moreover, NYCFC has allowed merely two goals during that span, having taken three shutouts while scoring eight goals.
 “This is the club that took a chance on me when I came into the league,” Nguyen said. “I hoped, perhaps, because it gave me my first start to build something here. I had a lot of love for this club and I always have, even when I left. I always wished well for this club and followed them from afar.
 “It was unfortunate the way we parted ways, but I’ve never lost love for this club.”

Pebblebrook coach Leroy Hood said the improved play in the second half was all about execution.
 “It was nothing special at halftime. We didn’t make a lot of adjustments,” Hood said. “We were going to do what we did and Mundy’s Mill was going to do what they do so at the end of the day we just focused more so on execution.”
 Explosive plays fueled the Falcons to their second win of the season and those are something that Hood said he thinks separates this year’s team from the squad that went 3-7 in his first year as coach.

The five lowest-ranked stadiums were FedEx Field (Washington FT), TIAA Bank Field (Jaguars), Paul Brown Stadium (Bengals), Hard Rock Stadium (Dolphins), and Bank of America Stadium (Panthers). Perhaps it’s not a coincidence that all of these teams that reside in these lowest-ranked facilities have been, for the most part, dismal of late, and the only recent Super Bowl participant within the past 30 seasons was the Panthers in 2016.
 But right above the Carolina franchise’s 24th-best (or fifth- _worst_ ) home stadium is, surprisingly, Gillette Stadium, home of the six-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.
 Gillette, originally dubbed CMGI Field before the naming sponsor went under prior to the start of the Patriots’ 2002 season, is ESPN’s 23rd-ranked facility despite the fact that only eight other stadiums opened _after_ Bob Kraft’s glittering replacement to the old Foxboro Stadium threw open its doors in the spring of 2002, for a Revolution soccer game.
 That means that a relatively young 18-year-old facility is actually ranked behind such elderly stadiums as Lambeau (opened in 1957), Arrowhead (1972), Bills Stadium (1973), the Saints’ Superdome (1975), and Soldier Field, home of the Bears since 1924. Admittedly, some of these older stadiums benefit in the rankings because of their “history” and “atmosphere,” more so than Gillette Stadium, but it’s still gotta bug the Kraft family that their once-sparkling 68,000-seat facility is ranked so low by ESPN.
 I can’t really say that Gillette is better or worse than other NFL facilities, because I’ve never been to any other cities’ stadiums, other than Gillette’s ultra-depressing predecessor. But what I can say is that Gillette Stadium, for the most part is, in this day and age, nothing special.
 First, though, the positives about it.
 Gillette was a long-needed replacement to Foxboro Stadium, and to his credit, Bob Kraft did not move the team out of New England when he bought the team and couldn’t get a downtown Boston stadium deal (even though he slow-danced with the governor of Connecticut to potentially move the franchise to Hartford). Kraft also built the stadium primarily with his own money, and didn’t sell the high-priced “personal seat licenses” that most owners have used to raise pre- construction capital.
 And Gillette Stadium, when it opened, was indeed a remarkable facility, although to many, myself included, it would have _had_ to look fantastic given the dismal nature of Foxboro Stadium, with its wind tunnels, aluminum bleachers, and lack of restrooms. The “bridges” on either side of Gillette were nice touches, along with the replica “lighthouse” on the stadium’s north side.

“The course opened May 11 and it’s been crazy ever since, a record number of rounds — it’s been wild,” Malcolm said the other day from the club’s pro shop, scanning over the roster of who is playing and when, the schedule of lessons for women and junior players and the calendar for upcoming fall club tournaments.
 “The number of people playing golf this year, it’s a busy club to begin with and with everyone working from home and wanting to get out, golf has been the ideal sport,” Malcolm said of the rekindling of interest to take out the clubs.
 Malcolm, who’s in his fourth season as the club’s pro and in his fourth year leading Merrimack’s golf team, had previously been the club pro at the Dublin Lake (N.H.) Club, where he supervised a six-member staff, managed tournaments, organized junior clinics and provided private lessons.
 Prior to his stewardship in New Hampshire, Malcolm had served as a PGA pro at four other clubs, starting with the nearby Franklin Country Club in 2002, the Old Marsh Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., the Whitinsville Golf Club from 2003-07 and the Winchester Country Club from 2011-13.
 Prior to arriving on campus in Andover at Merrimack, Malcolm had served as the assistant golf coach at Southern New Hampshire University for three seasons where he helped guide one of the top-ranked NCAA Division II men’s programs in the country while helping establish the foundation for the women’s team that was launched in 2014-15. He also coached the Northbridge High School golf team from 2003-07.
 He was named the 2016 New Hampshire PGA Pro of the Year. Over the 2019-20 tournament season, Malcolm finished among the top 10 in 20 of 26 starts. In both 2018 and 2019, he finished among the top 10 in nine New England events each season. He’s also played an extensive regional tournament schedule of amateur and PGA events for better than a decade, qualifying for the Mass. Open Championship in 2014.
 And to think, he owes it all to a trio of individuals.
 First up is his dad, Paul Malcolm, who put a golf club in his hands by age 8 and shepherded him around the layout of the Heather Hill Country Club in Plainville.
 Second is Mike Cosentino, who entrenched in him a Bible’s worth of lessons on and off of the course as the King Philip Regional High School golf coach and now as the pro at Heather Hill. Malcolm, who graduated from KP in 1997, played four years of golf for the now 90-year-old Cosentino before heading to Bryant University.
 Third is North Attleboro’s Archie Boulet, the late Bryant University golf coach who mentored Malcolm for his four years as a Bulldog and kept adding chapters to Malcolm’s textbooks on the game.
 “Playing golf for Mike (Cosentino) and then for Archie (Boulet), golf has been great to me,” Malcolm said from his southern New Hampshire home he shares with his wife Ingrid and two daughters. “The rest is history — I wouldn’t be in the golf business if it wasn’t for them. Coach Cosentino was great getting me into competition and Archie was super supportive.”
 Malcolm was the Bulldogs’ captain during his senior year, helping Bryant qualify for the NCAA Division II National Championship. He earned NE10 All- Conference First Team and Division II All-New England First Team honors in 2000 and was the recipient of the Bryant College Bulldog Leadership Award. He graduated from Bryant in 2001 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration.
 He’s taken the lessons learned from throughout his playing career and is applying them to Merrimack’s women’s golf program, of which he became head coach during the 2016-17 season and was responsible for transitioning the Warriors’ program from NCAA Division II to Division I in Sept. 2019.
 Malcolm nurtured the team to its best season in program history in 2018-19 to wrap up the Division II era on an incredible note. Not only did Merrimack win its fourth and final Northeast-10 Conference championship in five tries, but the Warriors made history by earning an automatic team qualification into the NCAA Division II Women’s Golf Super Regional Championship. Along the way, Merrimack won a season-record five tournaments and placed second at two others to comprise the greatest year thus far in the still relatively young history of the program.
 For his efforts, Malcolm was named Northeast 10 Conference Coach of the Year for the first time in his career.
 “It was nice to follow in Archie’s (Boulet) footsteps at Bryant into coaching,” Malcolm said.
 Malcolm was a determining factor of guidance for the greatest individual season by a student-athlete in Merrimack women’s golf history. Krystal Knight, a 2019 graduate, became the first WGCA All-American in school history after qualifying as an individual for the 2019 NCAA Division II Women’s Golf National Championship. Knight, who was just the second student-athlete ever in school history to achieve such a feat, won seven individual tournaments — including her second straight NE10 medalist honor — to wrap up her career as a four-time all-conference first team selection and a two-time CoSIDA Academic All-District honoree.
 “It’s fun coaching,” Malcolm said. “I like college athletics in general.”

ATLANTA -- Jeff Sims hardly looked like a freshman in his first college game.
   
 Sure, there were a couple of early interceptions he'd like to have back, but no one was complaining after Sims rallied Georgia Tech to an upset at Florida State in the season opener.
   
 Now, Sims is set to face an even stiffer challenge when the Yellow Jackets host No. 14 Central Florida on Saturday.
   
 He's quickly become a big man on campus, reveling in a wave of accolades after becoming the first true freshman quarterback in Georgia Tech history to lead the team to victory in a season opener.
   
 Sims completed 23 of 34 passes for 277 yards -- the most completions by a Yellow Jackets quarterback since 2005 -- in a 16-13 victory over the Seminoles.
   
 Don't expect him to revel in the adulation. The day after the game, he was the first player to show up for meetings, according to coach Geoff Collins, and the first player to hit the practice field.
   
 "My mom always taught me not to let anything get in my head," Sims said. "After the game, she always told me to celebrate that night, but the next day you have to get back to work. That's exactly what I did. I pushed off everything that happened (last) Saturday. Now I'm preparing for UCF. I want to be a leader on this team and do whatever I can to help this team win."
   
 Georgia Tech (1-0) will be facing a team that knows a lot about winning.
   
 Over the last three years, UCF has won 35 of 39 games, becoming one of the best Group of Five programs in the country. The Knights' opener is their only game against a Power Five opponent during the regular season, and they're eager to shine before a national television audience.
   
 "We've been good, I feel, for the last three to four years," linebacker Eriq Gilyard said. "We've been playing with kind of a chip on our shoulder to prove everybody wrong. This year we're not trying to prove anybody wrong, we're trying to prove ourselves right. We know how good we are."
   
 The Knights are coming off a bit of a disappointing season by their lofty standards, losing three games -- all on the road -- by a total of seven points.
   
 Dillon Gabriel, who seized the quarterback job early in his freshman season, said he's far more prepared for those sort of tight games as a sophomore -- despite the unusual offseason and a delayed start to the regular season because of the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 "Now I know how to approach them," said Gabriel, who threw for 3,653 yards and 29 touchdowns in 2019. "It feels a lot different. Even with all this uncertainty, I feel confident with our guys."
   
 Some things to watch for when Georgia Tech hosts UCF:
   
 Confusing the kid
   
 The UCF defense hopes to take Sims out of his comfort zone.
   
 While the Knights aren't known for bringing a lot of blitzes, they do play press coverage and look to deny the short and intermediate throws that worked so well for Sims in the opener.
   
 "It's critical for us that we create negative plays, get him into third-and- long situations, and try to put him in uncomfortable situations," UCF coach Josh Huepel said. "That's true with every young quarterback that you play."
   
 Kicking woes
   
 The Yellow Jackets are looking to bounce back from a miserable performance in the kicking game.
   
 Freshman Jude Kelley had three kicks blocked by Florida State -- two field goals and an extra point -- but gathered himself to boot a game-winning 32-yarder in the fourth quarter.
   
 Collins blamed himself for not giving the special teams more work in preseason practice because he was so concerned about making sure the players followed coronavirus protocols.
   
 "That's completely on me," he said. "Hats off to our guys for regrouping on that game-winning field goal."
   
 Big Mac
   
 UCF is counting on another big season from Greg McCrae, who rushed for more than 1,000 yards two years ago.
   
 An injury limited McCrae to 629 yards and seven touchdowns last season.
   
 Run to the ball
   
 The Knights are focused on creating more turnovers this season.
   
 They had 21 a year ago -- a significant drop from their average the previous two seasons (30) -- and five of those came during a bowl win over Marshall.
   
 Fans in the stands
   
 Georgia Tech is allowing a socially distanced crowd of about 11,000 for the game at 55,000-seat Bobby Dodd Stadium.
   
 Fans will be required to wear masks except when their eating or drinking at their seats. Georgia Tech athletic director Todd Stansbury said ushers would be moving through the stands to make sure everyone abides by the mandate.
   
 "A lot of people will be watching us to see if we can pull this off in a safe manner," Stansbury said. "Our athletes know they must represent their teams in the right way at all times. We're asking our fans to do the same."

Malcolm’s second full year with the program in 2017-18 featured six top-four team finishes, including one victory and three runner-up performances. Knight had the best individual campaign up until that point in program history, winning five of the nine events she competed in, including the 2017 Northeast 10 Conference Championship, marking the fourth straight year that a Warrior had claimed the title.
 Malcolm also saw three single-round scores of 70 recorded, tying the program’s single-round-low record. Malcolm and the Merrimack program were rewarded with a trio of Northeast 10 Conference selections with Knight earned a spot on the CoSIDA/Google Cloud Academic All-District squad as well as the Northeast 10 Sports Excellence Award winner and all-academic team selection.
 Malcolm was instrumental in helping both Knight and 2018 graduate Alessandra Ricigliano earn NCAA Super Regional in the spring of 2017 after he took over the reign of the program earlier in the winter. That marked the first occasion in school history that Merrimack had multiple student-athletes qualify for the NCAA Super Regionals in the same season.
 Recruiting new players to follow in the footsteps of the team’s success is challenging.
 “Recruiting takes so much time,” Malcolm said of extending the base from New England and the New York-New Jersey metro area to the South and now to China, India and Australia.
 “Certainly Division I golf is a different level of competition and there’s a lot of traveling involved,” he said. “To go from Division II, it’s a different game in Division I — the courses are longer and harder and to be competitive. The players that you need to recruit have national and international experience. You try to get some of the international kids over to the (United) States to play.”
 And without viewing a spring and summer schedule of tournaments due to the coronavirus, Malcolm’s recruiting has been reduced to online viewing of swings.
 “There are a lot of serious players out there (in college golf), but the pool of players (from the high school ranks) is small,” he said. “It’s challenging, we’re trying to get the right girls into the program.”
 In the Warriors’ first campaign at the Division I level, the fall season was highlighted by junior Jordan Laplume of Maine, the Northeast 10 Conference Rookie of the Year as a freshman, who accounted for top 10 performances in Merrimack’s schedule of five tournaments. Then during the corona virus- shortened spring season, sophomore Alexandra Tomasso of Waverly, N.Y. had a top-30 result at the Lonnie Barton Invitational in Daytona, Florida, the last tournament competition before the pandemic sent all student-athletes to the sidelines. Laplume and Tomasso also both had stroke averages under 85 on the year.
 This fall’s golf season was cancelled with the next competition most likely not to happen until late February.
 “The kids are on campus, we’re practicing three days a week, but there’s no competition,” Malcolm said. “It’s challenging, the kids are getting tested once a week. Maybe it’ll get back to normal in the spring.”
 The time away from competition has given him space to reflect on the game, including his course management skills and the future of the game.
 “I try to be consistent with everything, but absolutely as you go along, you pick up different things on golf course management,” he said. “Like junior golf, trying to grow the game with kids – Nashua CC has a lot of families, so we’re trying to build that program and carry on golf to the next generation.
 “A lot of kids aren’t playing golf these days; it’s kind of different from when I was growing up.”
 Back then, he was Plainville-Wrentham-Norfolk area friends with Jim Renner, former Bishop Feehan great turned PGA Pro, and Sean Harbor, another former Shamrock as well as a Bryant University teammate and dormmate. He mentioned area players like Mike Michel and Tommy Raposa that he toured the fairways of Heather Hill CC with as a kid.
 “We didn’t have a great golf team at KP, I kind of had to talk a bunch of people into playing,” Malcolm said. “Jimmy (Renner) and Sean (Harbour), we played AAGA (Attleboro Area Golf Associatiion) tournaments together, we keep in touch.”
 “I’m not sure if now that there are too many other things to do,” Malcolm said of the small smattering of boys and girls taking to the game of golf. “Other sports have taken up a lot of time and kids don’t have the time to come to the club and spend all day here as we would as kids growing up.”
 Naturally, Malcolm also thinks back to the days his dad had him out at the practice range and on the No. 1 tee at Heather Hill, where his love for the game of golf was groomed.
 “I’ve always liked coaching, I saw myself after Bryant of trying to get into college coaching,” Malcolm added. “Playing competitively for so many years, you know what it takes to bring that mindset to the girls and make it fun for them.
 “I drive the (Merrimack) van and turn the music up just like Archie did!”

RABAT, Morocco (AP) — Despite a government ban on large gatherings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, scores of demonstrators protested outside the Moroccan Parliament to denounce Arab countries agreeing o normalize ties with Israel. Israel on Tuesday signed historic diplomatic pacts with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in a U.S.-brokered deal. Morocco was reported to be among other Arab countries considering a similar move, though the prime minister rejected the idea last month. Protesters in Morocco's capital of Rabat Friday waved Palestinian flags, decrying the deals as “treason\" and chanting “Palestine is not for sale.\" The Palestinians view the pacts as a stab in the back from their fellow Arabs in the Gulf and a betrayal of their cause for a Palestinian state. Israel and Bahrain's agreements have been condemned by many across the Arab world. The protesters in Rabat also burned a mock Israeli flag. Dozens of police officers watched the scene from a distance. Organizers interrupted the chanting occasionally to urge participants to wear masks and to respect social distancing rules. “The normalization deals are an attack on the Palestinian people and their cause,\" human rights activist Abdelhamid Amine told The Associated Press. “We are calling on the Moroccan government not to follow suit and we urge it not to surrender to the Zionist and imperialist pressure like other Arab countries,” said Amine, former president of the Moroccan Association of Human Rights and one of the rally organizers. Last month, Moroccan Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani said the kingdom rejects any form of normalization with Israel. “The Moroccan monarch, government and people will always defend the rights of the Palestinian people and Al-Aqsa Mosque,” he...

SAGE adviser Professor Susan Michie warned ministers not to repeat the mistake of the March lockdown in implementing measures to slowly, as she proposed closing pubs, bars and restaurants, slashing the number of households meeting, work from home if possible and an extension of furlough until 2021.
 She told The Daily Telegraph: "We need a stitch in time. We need to learn the lessons of the spring. Every day's delay to a step change in measures to restrict transmission when it is increasing exponentially will be expensive in terms of health and lives in the short term and the economy in the long term."

Nuovo appuntamento per gli appassionati del tiro con la balestra: domenica 20 settembre alle 15.30 presso il Campo Tiri della Repubblica di Lucca (in Via di Pattana, Pontetetto) si disputerà la 2a Giostra Ghibellina. L’associazione lucchese Contrade San Paolino sfiderà la Compagnia Balestrieri della città di Amelia in una gara a squadre e in corniolo, con regolamento LITAB per la balestra da banco.
 I balestrieri di Amelia nell’ultimo Campionato Italiano LITAB si erano distinti aggiudicandosi il quarto posto con 303 punti, contro i 324 punti delle Contrade lucchesi, attualmente campioni in carica.
 Il nome della manifestazione si ispira al noto condottiero lucchese Castruccio Castracani, ghibellino per eccellenza, fra le cui imprese si annovera la marcia su Roma nel 1328 con un seguito di 300 cavalieri e 1.000 balestrieri.
 Questa gara sarà tra le prime ad essere disputate fra associazioni fuori regione dopo lo stop forzato dall’emergenza sanitaria. Si spera che sarà solo l’inizio di una progressiva ripresa in sicurezza delle attività delle varie associazioni che praticano il tiro con la balestra, dopo l’annullamento del Campionato Italiano 2020 che ha impedito a tutti i balestrieri aderenti alla LITAB di ritrovarsi come di consueto.
 L’ingresso al campo tiri all’aperto è libero, ma sarà richiesto di rispettare le normative anti-COVID19 previste per i luoghi pubblici (distanziamento interpersonale minimo, mascherina e autocertificazione di buono stato di salute).

Mit am Tisch saß Christoph Wessels , der den Fachbereich Kultur vertritt und mit den Gastspielen des Kölner Kabarettisten Henning Schmidtke und des Jazz- Trios „Leerik meets Christian Kappe“ weitere Akzente setzte. „Wir hatten drei ausverkaufte Konzerte“, berichtete Heming weiter. Gleich das Eröffnungskonzert mit „Dimi on the Rocks“ und Luisa Laakmann aus Oelde habe großen Zulauf gehabt. Ähnlich groß war der Andrang dann noch bei Jonas Künne und Bearny Weaver. Ein Konzert habe allerdings nur zur Hälfte stattfinden können, erinnerte sich Heming. Ein Starkregen habe verhindert, dass Pete Alderton zu Ende spielen konnte. Nach einer halben Stunde habe das Wasser so hoch auf der Bühne gestanden, dass man sich allein aus Sicherheitsgründenfür den Abbruch entschieden habe.

E' apparentemente in perfetta salute, ma in realtà presenta segni gravissimi di deterioramento dovuti all'attacco di funghi che consumano il legno.
 Si tratta del grande tiglio che sorge sugli spalti delle mura, in corrispondenza dell'uscita del baluardo San Colombano, di fronte alla piazza della stazione. Ieri (17 settembre), nell'ambito delle indagini sulle alberature delle Mura e degli spalti, condotte per conto del Comune da agronomi specializzati, l'albero è stato sottoposto a tomografia (una sorta di tac delle piante) che ha messo in evidenza come il fusto sia completamente cavo, dalla base fino al punto in cui si dipartono i rami (il cosiddetto castello). Non solo: anche molti dei rami più grandi sono stati attaccati dai funghi e si trovano nelle stesse condizioni del fusto.
 Come spiega l'agronoma Irene Benvenuti, che ha effettuato le indagini del caso, l'apparente contraddizione fra l'aspetto della pianta, estremamente vitale, e la sua reale condizione di salute, è dovuta al fatto che i fasci vascolari che portano acqua e nutrimento e che sono responsabili della fotosintesi clorofilliana, si concentrano nello spessore esterno della corteccia, mentre la restante parte, più interna, è deputata al sostegno della pianta.
 Visti i risultati delle indagini di ieri, l'amministrazione ha disposto la transennatura dell'area circostante il tiglio e all'inizio della prossima settimana saranno effettuate indagini supplementari, con tomografie specifiche ai singoli rami dell'albero. In questo modo, infatti, l'amministrazione avrà tutti gli elementi necessari per poter decidere se l'esigenza principale della tutela della sicurezza pubblica potrà essere coniugata con la conservazione della pianta stessa (e in che modo), evitandone quindi l'abbattimento.

This past week, ESPN.com published a best-to-worst ranking of NFL stadiums. The factors in play to determine each fortress's standing included atmosphere (20% of the rating), features (20%, which included the specialty "bells and whistles" of each venue), traditions (15%), tailgating (15%), the facility's location (10%), all-inclusive cost to attend games (10%), and the stadium's history (10%).
 The top five in ESPN’s rankings were fairly predictable, and include Lambeau Field (Packers, with five of its categories within the top three and three being top-ranked), CenturyLink Field (Seahawks, which included three category runners-up), Arrowhead Stadium (Chiefs), Heinz Field (Steelers), and the newest of the bunch, U.S. Bank Stadium, which became the Vikings’ home in 2016.
 By the way, it’s worth noting that the NFL’s two newest stadiums — in Las Vegas (Raiders) and LA (Rams and Chargers) — were not part of the rankings, because, well, fans and media have yet to experience them first-hand.

“Everyone here who’s seen me knows my game,” Nguyen said of being released by Inter Miami and finding his way back to Foxboro. With Miami, Nguyen made five appearances, three in the MLS is Back Tournament, but played only sparingly, 92 minutes. “It was more that I wasn’t on the same page with the Inter coach, so that was frustrating to not be able to get playing time there. I feel like my skill sets are still a big use and can help at any time with any team.
 “When Bruce (Arena, the Revolution coach) says we can use you, I jumped at that idea for sure. I feel like I have a lot left in the tank to give and I want to bring the (MLS) Cup to New England.”
 Nguyen has appeared in 244 MLS matches over nine seasons, 192 of them with New England, which places him in the No. 10 spot all-time. Nguyen started his second tour of duty with the Revolution substituting for Kelyn Rowe in the 76th minute of the Philadelphia match, successfully completing all 11 of his passes over his 14 minutes of work.
 “He (Arena) thinks I can really help this team, and so do I,” Nguyen said. “I’ve watched them last year and this year in the bubble and, like I said, this team has everything you need to get to the Cup, I feel I can help them in different ways.
 “Everyone has seen my game and I feel like I can help facilitate and give chances to these guys up top while also being able to help with composure in possession and fluidity with our attack.”
 Nguyen spent the 2019 season with Los Angeles, appearing in 23 matches with 11 starting spots, totaling four assists. Nguyen was traded to LA by New England in May of 2018 and started 20 of the 25 matches in which he appeared for LAFC that season.
 Nguyen ranks No. 2 on the Revolution all-time list for match-winning goals, shots, and assists, and third in shots on goal and goals.
 Nguyen is one of only three Revolution players (also Diego Fagundez and Ralston) to tally 40 goals and collect 40 assists as a Revolution player, being one shy of the first ever to achieve 50 goals and 50 assists.
