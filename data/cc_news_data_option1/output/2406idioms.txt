  CMU Spanish professor Tom Acker was impressed with Foster’s strong support and felt there was a lot of good political will on the side of immigrants these days.


  “It’s good to see the Supreme Court has voted on the side of 700,000 young people in our country who are hard workers and everything else you’d expect from U.S. citizens,” he said. “I was in surgery, and I woke to a text from my niece saying I’d be happy when I wake.”


  While President Trump vowed to resubmit his administration’s efforts to end legal protections for Dreamers, Acker’s confidence in the program is higher than ever.

The immediate future of Colorado’s economy remains bleak, but there is light at the end of the tunnel, state economists said Friday.


  After a precipitous drop in the state and national economies because of the COVID-19 pandemic that sent unemployment rates soaring, there was a slight uptick in job gains and expected revenues in the last month, economists with the governor’s office and the Colorado Legislature told lawmakers in presenting their revenue forecast for the second quarter of this year.


  But while they offered that good news, they quickly added that any full recovery still is more than a year away, and then only if something else doesn’t hit the fan.

The solution here is clear. An overwhelming majority of Americans, including Republicans, believe the government should leave the Dreamers alone and craft a path to citizenship. That can be done only by Congress. President Donald Trump has been an unreliable figure on this issue, saying at one point that he would support legislation to help the Dreamers, but then holding the issue hostage to his own dreams for a border wall with Mexico. Whether Trump would do the right thing now as he campaigns for reelection is anyone’s guess, but Congress should make the effort and force the issue. And if Trump successfully vetoes it, the nation can hope that the next president could fix it come January.
 At a base level, it’s troubling and dysfunctional that a relative handful of xenophobes among Trump’s base can in effect block a sensible humanitarian act supported by the vast majority of their fellow citizens. That is the antithesis of a healthy democracy. And in this instance, it has a drastic impact on the lives of people caught up in circumstances created by others. Congress needs to get its act together and take an obvious step in the national interest.

"I just felt that at the end of the day that it wasn't the voices of the maids that were heard. I know (my character) Aibileen. I know (Octavia Spencer's character) Minny. They're my grandma. They're my mum," Davis, 54, previously told _The New York Times_.

As parents of small children head back to workplaces during Washington's phased reopening, they will need access to safe, affordable, quality child care.
 As longtime child-care advocate state Rep. Tana Senn, D-Mercer Island, puts it, there will be no economic recovery without child care. The two go hand in hand.

The borage and salad burnet I planted in my herb garden also have wandered all over the place. Now that the borage is blooming, I’m enjoying the novelty of putting the tiny blue flowers in every salad I make.
 The edible flowers aren’t necessarily delicious — they are so small that the taste is hard to detect in a salad — but they’re pretty and putting them in salads has become a summertime ritual to me, so I can’t pull those, either.
 I could try to get in the habit of working in the garden every evening after dinner from 7–8:30 p.m. in an attempt to rein in the runaway weeds and flowers, but the chances of that happening more than once are about as high as the chances of teaching earwigs to pull bindweed.
 It’s a little too hot in the evening, I’m a little too tired, and the mosquitoes think I’m a little too tasty.

  Lockdown home-schooling has tested parents' patience in the past few months, with many people coming to respect teachers on a new level.


  The coronavirus pandemic has forced schools to rapidly refocus and adapt, in addition to the struggles many were already facing with funding and teacher recruitment.


  Ofsted is the least of school leaders' worries at the moment, as the regulator has suspended all routine inspections in light of the situation.


  School standards will become even more crucial come September, however - with concerns of an ever-growing attainment gap while children are away from the classroom, it will take an even bigger push to catch pupils up.
