Volunteers are the heart and soul of the PGA TOUR.  Each week, thousands of men and women devote their time, talent and passion helping to run all aspects of a PGA TOUR tournament.  Volunteers are critical to the success of a tournament, managing functions ranging from ShotLink scoring and concessions to guest services, pre-course set-up, on-course marshalling, merchandise, operations, Pro-Am, TOUR player registration, locker room, practice facility and much more. The personal rewards that come with being part of a tournament team go far beyond behind-the-scenes access, unbeatable perks, and the opportunity to be up close and personal with the greatest golfers in the world.  Volunteers share camaraderie, make lifelong friendships, and help tournaments give back to hundreds of charities that benefit from every event.

 They put five guys in the paint so Zych switched their defense from man to man over to a zone style and that did the trick. They also slowed down their offense.
 While the team wanted to attack, they held off and used up valuable clock time.
 Zych said the game was ugly to watch and when it came down to it, the stags hit some shots and the Falcons didn't.
 The team needs to get into a better rhythm. They have had three games cancelled because of snow and they missed a lot of playing time.
 "We just need to compete," Zych said.

It's no easy feat, but sometimes, you have to put your beloved pet on a diet. This can be especially difficult for bigger dogs. One way to get them to stop eating as much is by physically forcing them to eat slower. Well, the only way to do that is through a neat contraption like the Outward Hound Fun Feeder Dog Bowl Slow Feeder. This feeder serves as both a toy and a way to promote a healthier lifestyle for your dog. It utilizes fun mazes and intricate patterns to essentially make your dog forage for their food when they eat. As a result, your dog, unknowingly, consumes their food 10 times slower, which helps with digestion, prevents bloating, and ultimately helps them get fuller. The bowls are made with food-safe materials that are BPA, PVC, and Phthalate-free. They're also quite stable and they won't slip and slide all over the place while your dog is participating in their little eating adventure. The bowl comes in three different sizes -- X-Small, which fits around 3/4 of a cup of dry food, Small, which holds two cups, and Large, which holds four cups. It's not easy to prevent any dog from being gluttonous, but this bowl certainly helps in that regard.

In order to process such enormous data sizes, state-of-the-art methods and tools are needed. Most of all, before analyzing, all collected data must first be prepared. This is the role of data warehouses. They have been existing in the civil market for years, offering its services, for example in business, industry, insurance company market or in medicine. They allow for effective data exploration: from the real ocean of information, they fish out certain dependencies, tendencies, regularities or quite contrary – irregularities.
 Such analytics requires devices of powerful performance, capable of dealing with such masses of data within a reasonable period of time. As data sizes are growing immensely, computer performance must also be increased. Apart from that, the so-called quantum computers are now being developed, the performance of which will be incomparably better than of traditional computers, and of which the main role is to be Big Data processing.

The most commonly planted hydrangea is called panicle hydrangeas. Panicle hydrangeas are pruned differently from smooth hydrangeas. Panicle hydrangeas can be lightly pruned to maintain an ideal shape, while allowing the plant to grow rather large, up to 10 or 15 feet. Plants can be pruned more severely to encourage a compact plant form and larger flower heads.
 Panicle hydrangeas can be cut back to the ground, but the new growth is weak and can be unstable under the weight of the flowers. For this reason, many gardeners prefer to leave a framework of old growth for support. To do this, cut the stems back to a height of 18 to 24 inches. This will keep stems upright during bloom. Another option is to prune your hydrangea into a tree. The panicle hydrangeas are the only species that can be pruned into a tree form.

Those who placed at the tournament were Devon Weber 1st, Koda Dipman 1st, Hunter Huber 1st, Kaiser Pelland 2nd, Hogan Thompson 2nd, Dylan Cox 3rd, Iziah Cook 3rd, and Jesus Ornelas 4th.   "The boys made improvements during the day in setups, attacks and mental toughness," Thompson said. "There are still some basic improvements that must be made over the next month to be where we need when the post season arrives, but each day like this gets us a step closer to where we need to be down the road."   Junior Devon Weber of the 113 lb. division took first place for the day, and also won the coaches' votes for the Outstanding Wrestler Award.   "Devon is focused and ready for the next challenge," Thompson said.   Weber moves on with an impressive record of 23-1 for the season.   Sophomore Koda Dipman has as near perfect record as well, 22-2 for the season, and took first place at the Clearwater Tournament for the 132 lb. division.   Senior Hunter Huber, 195 lbs., won first place at the tournament, putting his record at 16-4 for the season.   "Hunter has looked really solid the last few tournaments," Coach Thompson said.   "Each wrestler made adjustments, whether in positioning or with their mental game, or both, which is a good sign as the training continues for the post season in February," Coach Thompson said.

This "potato thing" sizzled into my life when my 6-year-old son decided to cook a potato.      He grated a spud, heated oil in a pan and added the tangle of potato shreds, and had the sense to leave the pan on low heat before getting distracted, which might be the only reason he managed to cook Potato Thing. The human urge to mess with things unnecessarily may have no greater stage than the kitchen. Potato Thing prefers to be left alone. Until it's time to flip.      I was in the kitchen at just the right time to flip this sizzling disk that smelled of gold. Gazing at the browned side now facing up, I saw the bright, greasy matrix of crunchy potato fibers that I had been smelling. We gathered 'round the pan, attracted by the smell. When the other side was done, we feasted on the tater tot-like magnificence of a crispy exterior and its pillowy center.      Since then, I've been seeing Potato Thing everywhere. Even the gas station the other morning, when my hunting buddy got back into the car with a so-called "Potato Triangle" that looked familiar, or the local greasy spoon, which serves this side called "hash browns."      The kids kept asking me to make it again, and I tried, but couldn't recreate the magic of that original thing.      At the farmers market, where so much important information is shared, Big Nancy set me straight on Potato Thing, or "fries," as she calls them.      "You need a really hot pan," the potato grower said, nodding understandingly when I told her about my troubles.   "You know how to make Potato Thing?" I asked, eagerly.      "It's pretty much the only way I eat spuds."      For the next three weeks, I made Potato Thing. On weekends I'd visit Big Nancy at the market, buy potatoes and talk Potato Thing.      She recommends waxy potatoes like Huckleberry Gold, a purple skinned yellow- fleshed variety she sells, or its more common cousin the Yukon Gold. A lot of water gets released during the course of a batch, and Big Nancy covers her skillet with a tight fitting lid, which concentrates the steam and cooks the potatoes at a temperature that's hotter than boiling water. Her cast iron lid collects water, which she occasionally pours off.      When I make it, I squeeze out the water before frying. And that's not the only way my Potato Thing differs from hers. But we are perfectly aligned in the most important part, where you just stand there and don't do anything. No stirring. One flip. And it's done.      Potato Thing   The quantities listed are for a single Potato Thing that will fill a six-inch pan. You can grate and mix larger batches, and even use a larger pan, but keep the individual Potato Things small and manageable. Some cheese, egg or other goodies will add depth and contrast, not to mention protein, to Potato Thing.      For 1 six-inch Potato Thing   • 1 pound peeled potato   • 1 tablespoon high temperature fry oil (safflower and peanut are my favorites)   • ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper   • Optional toppings: cheese, chile flakes, jalapeno slices, egg      Grate the potato and save the small, French fry-sized piece that remains in your fingertips after you don't dare grate any further. Squeeze out the water from the grated potato in a colander, as if making a snowball, and then transfer the potato to a bowl. Add the salt and pepper (and chile flakes, if you wish) and mix.      Pat the ball into a hockey puck-sized disk that fits on a spatula.      Heat the oil on medium/high. As it heats, add the potato end you didn't grate, and adjust the heat to a temperature where the fry cooks gently, bubbling contentedly but not menacingly. That's your cue that the oil is ready.      Remove the small fry and add the puck of shredded potato.      Use a spatula, fork or even your fingers to shape the thing into a circle that's about a half-inch deep. Press gently on the thicker parts, first in the center and then the edges, while pulling in the rim to keep it sharp. By this time it should be sliding in the pan like an air hockey puck. Put the lid on and hover nearby on alert. The minute you start to smell a hint of overbrowning, flip it.   If you look at the bottom and conclude you flipped it too early, you can re- flip it again later. For now, let the new side cook, lid on.      If it looks like it needs oil, add just a little, or some butter. When you smell brown, turn it down, and let it slowly cook home. Turning down the heat at the end allows time to add toppings like cheese, a fried egg or both.      Put the lid back on to melt the cheese. Serve hot.      If it cools down, don't despair. Re-fried in oil, Potato Thing reheats as well as any leftover, but more golden.

Chicago is widely known as the "windy city" but the California city of Palm Springs has been benefiting from its Santa Ana winds since 1982, when the first wind farm was built in the San Gorgonio Pass.      Coming from Los Angeles, travelers will find thousands of turbines -- about 4,000 -- on both sides of Interstate 10. Driving by, the energy producing "windmills" look big, but travelers can't really get a handle on how big until standing next to one. Some of the blades are more than half the size of a football field, standing about 150 feet tall. At the top, the turbines have a generator that weighs in at 30,000 to 45,000 pounds.      The wind farm provides enough energy to power Palm Springs and the entire Coachella Valley. It is quite a sight, and to get an understanding of how it all works, take a wind farm tour. Best of the Best Tours offers tours with knowledgeable guides -- a lot more fun than science class. For information and to purchase tickets visit thebestofthebesttours.com.      Palm Springs is also known for its movie history. Many famous people lived in this valley, including Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, Tony Curtis, Sandra Dee, Gene Autry, Cary Grant, Elvis and so many more. It was where they escaped to enjoy privacy and relaxation. Today's stars who can be seen in the area include Leonardo DiCaprio, Suzanne Somers, Barbra Streisand and James Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt and President Obama and family.

At the bottom of a cold crevasse in the Uncompahgre Gorge, where sunlight reaches but only a few minutes a day, the climb to the surface begins.
 The darkness is broken with the clicking echoes of steel penetrating ice. Slowly a small figure emerges on the icy wall, tethered by a rope.
 If the passion of ice climbing lies in the ascent, then Ouray has succeeded in fostering the rise of this winter sport. Climbers and spectators from around the world will celebrate the 25th Ouray Ice Festival, Jan. 23-26.
 What started out as a few rowdy locals climbing frozen leaks from an old water pipeline has turned into a world-class ice climbing destination.
 During the ice festival, all of the hotel rooms in Ouray are booked, restaurants are packed, and a slew of foreign languages can be heard around town. Ouray’s population of just over 1,000 residents triples in size.
 About a quarter-mile south of downtown, the Ouray Ice Park spans the Uncompahgre Gorge. Combined with the Uncompahgre River below, the box canyon forms a dramatic backdrop that is spectacular and functional for adventurers picking their way up fangs of ice using axes and wearing boots fitted with spikes on the toes.
 The park uses about 7,500 feet of irrigation pipe to drip and spray more than 200,000 gallons of spring water from nozzles, usually starting just after Thanksgiving. The effect is a blue, man-made icescape.
 Temperature is everything, as the freezing process begins in late fall. Ice farmers try to get the park open after Thanksgiving, yet unpredictable temperatures can keep climbers off the ice for days and even weeks.
 “It was warm and we struggled getting the park open, but we had some cold weeks that helped,” said Dan Chehayl, the ice park’s executive director and one of the park’s ice farmers.
 In 2019, record amounts of snowfall and moisture broke a years-long drought in the Western Slope of Colorado, including the northern San Juan Mountains.
 “We’re having a good season this year. We have an unlimited water supply, and that’s something we haven’t had in five to six years because of the drought,” Chehayl said.
 Chehayl reports 100 to 150 routes are open this season to climbers of every skill level, from young children to boomers, and beyond.
 Pirates of ice
 Ouray resident Bill Whitt arrived in town from southern California in 1989, seeking a “climbing lifestyle.” He had read somewhere there was good climbing in the Ouray area and decided to investigate for himself.
 The first routes of the gorge were climbed on small ribbons of ice formed from leaks from a water pipeline that was part of an old hydroelectric water system. Water was engineered to flow from a dam at the bottom of Red Mountain through 1.5-mile pipeline along the rim of the gorge to spin turbines in the city’s then-dormant hydroelectric facility. It was located on the southern edge of town.
 In those early days, Whitt and fellow climber Bill McTiernan, another Ouray local, ventured into the gorge each winter with crampons and tools exploring mixed routes of rock and ice.
 For years they had the gorge to themselves.
 “Those guys were pirates back then,” Chehayl said with a chuckle.
 After hydroelectric manager Eric Jacobson acquired the Ouray Hydroelectric Plant from Colorado-Ute Electric Association following bankruptcy proceedings in 1992, access to the gorge dried up, Whitt said. Jacobson welded the leaks shut to prevent ice climbers from trespassing on the property.
 “At that point we had to play ball,” Whitt said. “Before it became the ice park, there wasn’t any permission to climb there.”
 During this time, Whitt and business partner Gary Wild, a retired lawyer from California, co-owned a hotel in Ouray. Together, they decided to create an ice park to attract people to town during the slow, sleepy winter months. But in order to begin, they first had to mend relations with Jacobson.
 Whitt said Wild met up with Jacobson one day with a six-pack of beer as a peace offering to get the holes open on the pipeline again. After the two “hugged it out,” Whitt remembers, Wild began connecting hoses and shower heads to the pipeline to create new columns of ice.
 “We would go out there and from one drip, there would be two; then two drips became three, and so on. That’s how it grew,” Whitt said.
 Wild did all the legal work pro bono with Jacobson making sure there was adequate liability insurance for climbers.
 From there, Whitt said, Ouray was officially on the map for ice climbing.
 “Nothing was happening here, nothing,” Whitt said of Ouray during the winter months of the early 90s. “There was nobody here. It was dead until that park got going. People thought we were nuts!”
 Located at 7,792 feet, Ouray historically is a mining town. The Uncompahgre River that runs through it can have unique colorations due to heavy mineral influences from the San Juan Mountains. The minerals, combined with sediment from the constantly eroding landscapes, is not a conducive mix for successful ice climbing.
 In those early years of the festival, the ice, heavy with minerals and sediment, would not freeze well. The ice would become soft, melt quickly and break easily, creating “gross looking climbs,” Chehayl said. Worse, it could be dangerous for climbers.
 The early ice farming system rough, Whitt remembers.
 The park had to move from the old water supply to a reservoir that supplies the City of Ouray’s potable water. Now, water from the city’s reservoir, through the farming system, makes hardened blue ice on a massive scale.
 “Compared to the orange water, the water now is eons better. Now we have that perfect blue ice,” Whitt said.
 The City of Ouray is partnered with the ice park, whose board of directors and Jacobson lease part of the property to the city for $1 per year. In 2012, 24 acres of the park was transferred to the City of Ouray from the U.S. Forest Service, which led to more improvements and a sense of permanency.
 Ouray has always had summer visitors who know it as “the Switzerland of the USA.” The growth and maturity of the ice park has brought not only winter tourism, but full-time residents.
 According to data provided by the Ouray Visitors Center, 93% of winter visitors surveyed in 2018 reported they traveled to Ouray specifically for ice climbing, staying on average five-to-seven nights.
 During the 2015-16 season, ice park visitors contributed $3.6 million to Ouray’s overall $5.3 million winter visitor economy, a separate report says.
 “Now it’s a ski area, without the ski area,” Whitt said.
 Chehayl said accessibility makes the Ouray Ice Park a success. Located just off U.S. 550, the park is walking distance from a parking lot. Multiple viewing platforms have been built and the water-delivery infrastructure has improved. This has helped grow the popularity of the ice park.
 Chehayl expects the annual elite climbing competition, scheduled for 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday, to be one of the best ever, thanks to the 25-year milestone. Whitt is one of the judges.
 “We’re proud to celebrate the park, the caliber of climbers that come here, the sport itself, and looking forward to the future and see what 25 more brings,” Chehayl said.

FLINT -- When Eliza Trainer drowned after being swept off a pier in Lake Michigan, two men tearfully embraced during her vigil. One was her dad. The other felt like he was her dad.
 A few days later, the men's relationship fractured.
 Scott Trainer accused the other man's wife, Sabra Goodrich, of fraud when she was named the beneficiary of an online fundraiser to pay for Eliza's funeral.
 Trainer said he was eventually given control of the GoFundMe account, but only after he contacted the police and the fundraising website.
 Then, when a friend of Goodrich set up a personal fundraiser for Goodrich, who, with her husband, Derek, were close to Eliza, Trainer opposed the campaign in a Facebook post.
 The Goodriches want to use some of the proceeds to hire a private diver to find Eliza, who remains missing, but Trainer said the police don't need any help.
 "None of this is for the benefit of Eliza," he said about Goodrich's actions. "I just want them to leave my daughter out of whatever they're doing."
 Goodrich declined to comment, but friends defended her actions.
 Rachelle Huff, who started the private fundraiser, said it was her idea to raise money. She said Goodrich felt like a mom to Eliza and is guided only by the teen's best interests.
 "Sabra is an upstanding girl," Huff said. "She wouldn't do anything that wasn't on the up and up."
 How controversy erupted
 Eliza, 16, was an only child who was drawn to the large Goodrich family, relatives said. She accompanied the clan on vacations, shopping trips, fishing expeditions.
 She became close to Goodrich after her own mom died in 2015 from a rare form of ovarian cancer.
 On Jan. 1 Eliza and Goodrich's son, Kade, 19, drove to Holland to take photos of the large waves crashing into shore, said Trainer. Standing on the pier at night, a wave knocked them into the lake.
 Kade clambered onto a rock and tried to pull Eliza out of the water but a wave tore her away. Kade survived the ordeal.
 One day later, Goodrich scrambled to set up a GoFundMe account.
 She was going to be interviewed by a television reporter and wanted to be able to give viewers a place where they could donate money for Eliza's funeral, said Ian Cole, an acquaintance who helped her set up the account.
 She told Trainer about her plan, saying she would make him the recipient of the funds, Trainer said.
 After the account was set up, however, Goodrich was named as the beneficiary. Asked why it wasn't Trainer, Cole said he was under the impression Trainer wasn't a big part of Eliza's life.
 The fund drew $7,000 on the first day. It now has $15,555.
 Trainer still hadn't been named recipient after several days, so he emailed Cole, who was listed as organizer of the account.
 When Cole told him he needed to talk to Goodrich, Trainer said he would go to the police and Cole would be going to jail, Cole said.
 Trainer said he contacted Goodrich, who said she was dealing with five grieving children, that she was worried about her family. Trainer said he told her at least she had a family to worry about.
 "I asked her about (why the account hadn't been changed) and she came up with really dumb excuses," he said.
 After being threatened, Cole said he contacted GoFundMe, which switched the account to Trainer after three days.
 Fundraiser set up for dive
 On Jan. 9, the day Trainer was given control of the GoFundMe account, Huff began the personal fundraiser for the Goodrich family.
 Huff said she didn't use GoFundMe because the website was too difficult to work with.
 Instead she posted a Facebook message asking people to use PayPal to send donations to her or Goodrich.
 The money is to be used for the private dive, therapy for her children, who were close to Eliza, and the expenses of relatives who have traveled to West Michigan to look for the teen, Huff said.
 "Sabra wants to give her kids some closure (by helping to find Eliza)," she said.
 The Goodriches have been frustrated by the low number of times law enforcement agencies have sent divers to search the lake since Jan. 1, relatives said.
 Goodrich's mother, Linda Woods, who lives in the Flint suburb of Flushing, has been a daily visitor to the Holland shoreline. She said the water is calm most mornings.
 "We just don't understand it," Woods said about the infrequent searches.
 Capt. Mark Bennett of the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office said the water is too turbulent most days to send in divers.
 The Goodriches want to retain Bruce's Legacy, a search and recovery group from Black River Falls, Wisconsin, Woods said.
 The nonprofit has found 30 drowning victims around the world during its six years of operation, according to its website.
 The volunteer group asks only its expenses are covered during a search, Huff said. The cost for Eliza's search would be $600.
 Huff said she didn't know if Goodrich has received any donations in the fundraising drive.
 Trainer opposes private dives
 On Jan. 11, two days after Huff's Facebook message announcing the personal fundraiser, Trainer wrote his own social media post opposing it.
 Without referring to the Goodriches by name, he said a private dive team wasn't necessary. He said police were doing everything they could and didn't want anyone interfering with them.
 "PLEASE MAKE THIS GO VIRAL!" he wrote about his message.
 Trainer told The Detroit News the police won't allow private divers into what he called a crime scene, and the Goodriches know it.
 He surmised the personal fundraising drive wasn't being held through GoFundMe because of Goodrich's actions in the earlier fundraising campaign.
 A spokeswoman for GoFundMe said the website didn't have a problem with Goodrich.
 "Sabra Goodrich worked with our team to transfer the account," said spokeswoman Meghan Scripture. "It's not uncommon for someone to create a GoFundMe to help another individual."
 Huff said she didn't know if police would object to a private dive. She also had been unaware that Trainer was opposing her money-raising effort.
 "Oh, goodness," Huff said when told Trainer was questioning Goodrich's motives. "If he's saying that, I would think it's his grief talking."
 After Goodrich was emailed by The News Thursday and told about Trainer's criticism, she declined to comment. The publication was then contacted by Trainer, who said he had spoken with Goodrich after the email.
 Trainer said they agreed pain and anxiety over the tragedy, coupled with accusations of other people, had caused people to say hurtful things. He said they regretted it.
 Asked if Goodrich had made a hurtful comment, Trainer said he wasn't aware of any.
 In a Wednesday Facebook post, he said he hoped the finger-pointing would end.
 "My hope is that everyone can just get along and put all of this behind us," Trainer wrote. "I know in my heart that Eliza would want that."

If the rumors are right, the Galaxy S20 -- formerly known as the Galaxy S11 -- could be a beast of a phone, with a bold design on the back and a suite of powerful features within. Leaks and reports predict that the unannounced phone, which we're expecting to see Feb. 11 at Samsung's Unpacked event, will have up to four rear cameras (one of them with 108 megapixels) along with a large, sharp screen and a massive 5,000-mAh battery. This sounds impressive. I want it all, but I also want the little things that can take a phone from impressive to enjoyable.
 Consider the Galaxy Note 10 Plus that sits beside me as I write this. It's one of the best phones of the year -- I even gave the standard Note 10 an Editor's Choice Award for its balance of value, features and performance. Samsung has sold enough of them to firmly secure its place as the world's largest phone brand. Still, if I could pass a magic wand over both Note 10s, there are a few extra features I would add. They're the same things I want in the next flagship Galaxy phone.
 Every device has minor annoyances that keep you from fully loving it. I've heard them all. "I love this phone, but I wish it did _this_ ," or, "You know what I can't stand? It's _that_ ," and then the person I'm talking to launches into a detailed account of a tiny feature or design issue that's become the thorn in their side despite an otherwise good experience.
 So far, my wish list for the Galaxy S20's most important features -- 5G speeds, processing superpowers and camera advancements -- aligns with the rumors. Now I'll give you the smaller bonus details that could help take the Galaxy S20 over the top for me, whether they happen or not.

Can we talk about the star power these nominees have for just a moment? Three of the eight nominees (Lizzo, Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X) topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart at some point in this year, which is almost unheard of in the Best New Artist category. This is really going to come down to a two- way battle between Lizzo and Billie Eilish. Either of these ladies could take home the trophy, but if we had to bet, we’d put our money down on Lizzo. Her infectious music, along with her body-positive message, is a winning combo voters can get behind.

For a large adult dog, you should probably just stick with the K.I.S.S. method (you know, keep it simple, stupid). A deeper, stainless steel bowl will undoubtedly do the trick, making the Bergan Standard Dog Bowl a great choice. This bowl can fit 17 cups of dry food, giving your dog more than enough room to chow down on their meals. Each bowl contains a wide opening and base, so your dog can comfortably eat. The food will be spread out enough so they won't eat it all in one shot, which ultimately aids in the digestion process. These stainless steel bowls are rustproof, easy to clean, and dishwasher safe, making them durable, long-lasting, and a familiar part of your dog's favorite daily routine. They can be used for indoor or outdoor use, and they can be used to hold either food or water. They're also touted as non-porous and bacteria-resistant, which is great for your pup's overall health. We found that just a quick rinse with soap and water does the trick, but you don't need to clean it all that often, considering the sleek, stainless steel keeps the bowl fairly hygienic on its own.

When I talk with citizen groups in Tennessee about open government, people tell me they want more information about what their government is doing, not less.
 An informed citizenry results in better and more accountable government. But in plain language, people just want to know what’s going on, particularly when it affects their lives directly.
 How do people get informed? How does information about what government is doing flow to the public? And in this day and age, what methods are reliable, trustworthy and accurate?
 One reliable way is through the public notice laws. Government entities in Tennessee are required by law to publish public notices in local newspapers about a range of activities — public sales, regulations, bid lettings, meetings, seizures, ordinances and elections.
 These statutes have developed over time because lawmakers have thought certain information was important enough that government entities need to actively reach out and let people know.
 The same community newspaper where you find local obituaries, high school football game photos, news coverage of government meetings and stories about new businesses in town is where you can reliably find public notices.
 Carol Daniels, executive director of the Tennessee Press Association, said that a recent examination by her organization of circulation of printed newspapers in Tennessee showed that a majority reached at least 70 percent of households in their home county each week.
 Clearly, such newspapers that carry uniquely local news about their communities are still an effective way to deliver a local government message, too.
 So, what about the web? We all know it’s a powerful tool when we are searching for information. Tennessee Coalition for Open Government has continued to advocate that government entities that have a website should post information to their website.
 We also supported a provision inserted into the law in 2013 that required newspapers that publish public notices in their printed edition to publish for free the same notice, including any maps and other exhibits, in its entirety in their digital editions.
 This law, which went into effect in April 2014, also required the newspapers to include a link to these digital notices on the home page of their website, and required a statewide website to be established as a joint venture of these newspapers where all public notices in all newspapers in the state would reside free for anyone to peruse.
 One advantage for the public when a third-party publishes public notices — whether on an aggregated website or printed newspaper — is that they create a one-stop shop for the public, despite the notices coming from various government entities, banks and courts in a county or jurisdiction. Notices about government meetings, public hearings or budget information can be found along with other required legal notices, such as foreclosures, lien sales and court notices.
 Put another way by Daniels: “The public would need to go and look on a dozen or so websites per day or week to get the same information that should be in their local paper. The difference is the information is delivered to the public versus you going and looking for it and knowing where to look.”
 Some worry, with the rise of social media, that local community newspapers will disappear and no longer provide their historical role as a central interchange for hyper-local information. In some parts of the country, so- called “news deserts” have emerged where local community newspapers have closed shop and no one has replaced their function of providing independent, professional news coverage of local happenings.
 While such loss has been alarming, in Tennessee, community newspapers remain an important local business in a majority of our counties.
 These businesses contribute both to community life and commerce. Their unique role in providing effective and efficient outreach for public notice remains vital.

Under the current site plan only 42 affordable units out of a total of 395 units would be built; a bit more than 10 percent of the homes would be below market rate, with the vast majority luxury housing.

TORONTO -- Landowners in a rural Ontario municipality about two hours northwest of Toronto have signed an agreement that will allow authorities to soon start doing site tests for a proposed facility to store high-level nuclear waste.
 The agreement with the Nuclear Waste Management Organization leaves South Bruce as one of two possible sites for a deep geological repository, along with an area near Ignace in northern Ontario.
 Darren Ireland, a local farmer, said in a statement on Friday that the project "has the potential to bring long-term benefits to the area."
 About three-million highly radioactive used fuel bundles from reactors are currently stored at existing nuclear generating stations in Canada, including at the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station on the shores of Lake Huron near Kincardine, Ont.
 Authorities have long contended the current storage system is not sustainable and have been searching for a permanent solution, with the aim of finding a single site for storage by 2023.
 The proposed repository is separate from a proposed massive underground bunker for low and intermediate radioactive waste at the Bruce plant near Kincardine. That multibillion-dollar project has drawn fierce opposition both in Canada and the U.S. because of its proximity to Lake Huron.
 Although Ontario Power Generation insists its studies show the underground facility would safely contain waste that remains hazardous for thousands of years, the project has been stalled for years awaiting federal government approval. One condition Ottawa has set is for Indigenous groups in the area to give their blessing, which has not happened.
 The Nuclear Waste Management Organization has similarly been searching for a place to store used nuclear fuel, which is far more toxic. The organization said Friday it now has deals in place for about 526 hectares of land northwest of Teeswater, Ont., although Indigenous groups have yet to support the project.
 The deals with landowners include a combination of option and purchase arrangements to allow the waste organization to do studies while allowing landowners to keep using their land, the organization said.
 If the site is ultimately selected to host the repository, the organization would buy the optioned land. It would also then look to acquite more land in the area to form a site of about 607 hectares.
 Mahrez Ben Belfadhel, a vice-president with the waste management organization, said they were pleased landowners were on board, and called identification of the South Bruce site an important milestone.
 "With agreements in place and access to land in South Bruce, we expect to begin studies such as borehole drilling and baseline environmental monitoring in the coming months to assess the suitability of the area," Ben Belfadhel said in a release.
 The Bruce County municipality of South Bruce, south of Walkerton, Ont., has about 5,600 residents. Its main centres are the villages of Mildmay and Teeswater. The organization also said the adjacent township of Huron-Kinloss, Ont., would no longer be considered a potential host for the project.
 The waste organization was set up at the direction of the federal government in 2002 by Ontario Power Generation, N.B. Power and Hydro-Quebec. The three producers and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, a federal Crown corporation, fund its operations.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published on Jan. 24, 2020.

Song of year yeah is a songwriter’s award, so the lyrics of the song are more important than the production behind it. The songwriters of the song are nominated for it and not the artist who sings it (although in many cases, the artist singing the song had a hand in writing it). Taylor Swift was shut out of the bigger categories besides song of the year, so this could be her once chance to win a Grammy for the night. Lana Del Rey is also a strong contender since she was highly praised for her songwriting abilities on her new album. At the end of the day, we have to give this one to Swift.

 The recent Southern California graduate will use his communications degree as a content coordinator, while also being involved in podcasting, radio and television.
 "I had always dreamed of signing an NHL contract," Jablonski wrote on Twitter. "Unfortunately, that dream was taken away 8 yrs ago.

 Jablonski was playing in a game on Dec. 20, 2011 for Benilde-St. Margaret's of St. Louis Park, Minn., when he was hit from behind and sent head-first into the boards. The subsequent spinal-cord injury left him paralyzed.
 His Twitter bio states that he is a paralyzed hockey player who "won't be forever," and that he is striving to prove doctors wrong.
