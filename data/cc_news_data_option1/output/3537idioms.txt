A College Station man was arrested Friday afternoon after a car crash left one man seriously injured.
 According to Texas A&M University police, officers responded to a crash on Finfeather Road near F&B Road in College Station shortly before 5 p.m. There, a pickup driven by 58-year-old Stanley Lee Creeks had collided head on with a car. A man who was a passenger in Creeks’ truck was ejected from the vehicle and taken to CHI St. Joseph Hospital with serious injuries. A UPD spokesman said Saturday that the passenger is no longer in critical condition. Creeks and the driver of the BMW were treated for non-life-threatening injuries.
 While interviewing Creeks as paramedics prepared to transport him to a local hospital, police noticed his eyes were bloodshot and his speech was slurred, a report notes. He later told police he had a drink and that he had smoked a cigarette with unknown contents. He was treated for his injuries and arrested upon his release. While being booked into jail, Creeks told staff he needed to grab an ID from his pocket and proceeded to throw a paper bag into a toilet, reports state.

Nans Peters during Stage 8 of the Tour de France on Saturday Photo: IC
       Nans Peters scored a first home stage win on the Tour de France on Saturday with Britain's Adam Yates clinging on to the overall lead on a tough Pyrenean stage that caused an unexpected shake-up on Stage 8 of 21.      Chief among the day's victims was fancied French climber Thibaut Pinot, who dropped out of the race for the overall standings entirely on the penultimate climb.      Peters achieved his win over three major mountains in the presence of French Prime Minister Jean Castex, producing a brilliant long-range solo breakaway.      "I told myself, believe, believe believe," said the AG2R rider who finished the 141-kilometer run from Cazeres-sur-Garonne to Loudenvielle in just over four hours.      But there was also a ferocious battle on the final climb of the dreaded Col de Peyresourde. Yates, defending Tour de France champion Egan Bernal and French climber Romain Bardet were all dropped and appeared doomed.      Yates caught back up near the summit however while the other two swooped down the daredevil final descent to claw their way back closer to the form men, Primoz Roglic and Nairo Quintana.      Yates leads Roglic by three seconds, Frenchman Guillaume Martin by nine and Bardet by 11. Ineos leader Bernal is fifth at 13 seconds, level with three other Colombians, Quintana, Lopez and Uran in a tight overall standings.      "It was a really fast pace," said Yates of the last climb.      "I just went at my own rhythm and came back in my own time and I went with them all over the top," said the 28-year-old Mitchelton-Scott team leader.      Yates, whose brother Simon won two stages on the 2019 Tour de France, said his parents were also on the Tour, and possibly having a better time than he was.      "They got here two days ago," said Yates. "It's not every day you lead the Tour de France.      "Mum and Dad are making the most of it, they're having more fun than I am," he joked.      "Personally I just want to take it day by day."      Slovenian rookie Tadej Pogacar managed to break from the group and retrieve 37 seconds of the valuable time he lost on Friday.      Drama never seems to be far away from Pinot, a star in France whose fall three kilometers from the finish of Stage 1 finally took a terrible toll here.      Grimacing, he began clutching at his sore back on the penultimate climb when the Dutch Jumbo team put the hammer down.      His teammates fell back to help him struggle up that hill, patting him on the back and comforting the climber.      "I won't quit the Tour, but it's another failure for me, I've had too many failures," lamented Pinot. "It's a turning point in my career."      Another major victim was Tom Dumoulin of Jumbo, billed as a co-captain to Roglic, but ­Dumoulin also lost around two minutes after pulling Roglic as far as he could.      Sunday's stage nine is a 153-kilometer mountain stage between Pau and Laruns with two ­Category 1 mountains, a tricky final descent and an 8km flat run to the finish line.

“Hunter was very big on trucks,” said Adam Burke, the public information officer with McClellandtown VFD.
 On June 18, Braddee, 20-year-old Kayla N. Burwell, and 53-year-old Ronald Burwell Jr. were killed when a tri-axle dump truck crossed into the opposing lane of traffic and hit their pickup truck. The tri-axle driver was charged criminally after police alleged he was under the influence of multiple drugs.
 Since the collision, Burke said the family of Hunter Braddee became more involved with the fire department by first getting people active in paramedicine by paying for paramedics to receive the training they needed to save lives. Some family members also joined the fire department.
 When fire department members planned to build their own rescue truck from scratch due to limited funding, Bradee's family stepped in to purchase a rescue truck.
 After those involved selling and shipping the truck learned of the story behind it, those who sold the truck gave Hunter Braddee’s family a good deal, and the truck was shipped for free.
 On Saturday, Braddee’s grandfather, Bryan McKahan, drove the truck to the department and handed the title over to McClellandtown Fire Chief Stephen Campbell, who said words cannot thank the family enough for what they’ve done for the department.

Industry expert Andy Sutherden, who advises major companies with commercial tie-ups in football, told the paper: "The timing of the autumn rugby fixtures is perfect for Amazon because it’s the prime trading period for black Friday and Christmas.
 "‘There aren’t many prominent sporting events up for grabs in Quarter Four of October, November, December and it’s about getting into the public conscience.
 "Their broadcast strategy is to be very visible to the public when they want to attract the maximum amount of online retailing. They want to build an e-commerce database around sports fans."
 He pointed out Amazon see rugby fans as being of a high net worth, a demographic the company wishes to unlock.
 Wales' rearranged Six Nations clash with Scotland, to be played in London on October 31, will remain free-to-air.
 However, if Amazon get their way the Eight Nations fixtures will be broadcast away from traditional means in what would be a shock move.
 The issue over broadcast rights is one of the reasons why there has been a delay in formally announcing fixtures for the tournament, which replaces the planned autumn Tests.
 Wales are set to be in a group with England, Ireland and Fiji, with France, Scotland, Italy and either South Africa or Georgia battling it out in the other.
 Japan were due to participate, but are likely to pull out.
 Having the world champions on board will give extra impetus and broadcasters are said to be eyeing the potential prospect of a World Cup final re-run between England and South Africa on December 5.
 That is the date when the two winners of the eight Nations groups meet in a final, with the other teams also playing off against one another based on their own finishing positions.
 Wales and Ireland, of course, will have something to say about England winning their group and will expect to make the final themselves.
 Wayne Pivac's side are due to kick-off the tournament away to Ireland, before 'home' fixtures with Fiji and England. If fans are permitted to attend, those games will be played at London venues still to be announced as the Principality Stadium is out of bounds.
 Three Premier League grounds - Tottenham, West Ham and Arsenal - have been put forward as possible venues for Wales, as well as Twickenham. The same applies for their Six Nations finale with Scotland.

Quando foi questionado sobre os desafios da democracia americana, nomeadamente sobre a possibilidade de um governo estrangeiro ter manipulado as eleições internas, o ex-presidente começou por referir que os russos apenas tinham explorado o que já havia nos Estados Unidos. "Se vir a Fox News, vive num planeta diferente", ironizou, evocando de seguida um episódio protagonizado muitos anos antes pelo ex-senador democrata Patrick Moynihan, já falecido. Contou Obama que o ex-senador "desafiou um colega menos capaz" em relação a um tema que não especificou, e que este ficou tão nervoso, que se limitou a replicar "é a sua opinião, eu tenho a minha". "Meu caro", prosseguiu Obama citando Moynihan, "tem todo o direito a ter a sua opinião, mas não os seus próprios factos".

 “So if you do anything to accelerate that (bring back schools, etc) it speeds it up at a much faster speed than people would imagine.
 “It’s not a question if we are approaching a second wave or not, we have been in it for two months. The tipping point was the end of June before we even got out of phase two.
 “Even if you lean on the optimistic side it’s hard to see everything remaining open for very long.”
 And he added that he doesn’t believe it needs to “be like this” and there are “solutions and ways out”.

 “We are going to find ourselves back to square one. It’s going to start with loads of regional lockdowns and then once you have too many it results in a national lockdown.

Speaking of stress, chronic stress can build upon itself, causing blood pressure to not only rise, but stay high as well. Managing stress is often easier said than done, but there are ways to better control it. This can be done by truly understanding things you can control and dealing with them directly. Ironically, most things that stress us out are things out of our control. Being preoccupied with something we can do nothing about already sets us up for failure and frustration. Also, identify your triggers. Knowing what sets you off to begin with, means you have an opportunity to avoid it altogether (if possible) or at least make a plan to make it less of a burden or issue. Of course, prayer and meditation is an excellent way to reduce stress as well. Take at least 15-20 minutes, where you can throughout the day, to sit quietly and give yourself some “you” time.

Esiste un paese che si chiama Pollaiopolis, chiamato così perché abitato solo da galli, polli, galline e pulcini. Gli abitanti sono poche centinaia di pennuti, ma facevano un baccano terribile, soprattutto i galli, che litigavano per stabilire chi dovesse cantare per primo la mattina. Così accadeva che ciascuno di loro cercava di alzarsi più presto degli altri per esibirsi nel suo più sonoro chicchirichì. Ed ogni gallo rinfacciava all’altro di fare il chicchirichì migliore! Anticipa oggi, anticipa domani, avevano proprio esagerato, perché si erano messi a cantare nel cuore della notte. Al primo chicchirichì, comare Alba con sua figlia Aurora correvano a svegliare Messer Sole e a spingerlo fuori dalla porta e a dire a sorella Notte di andare a dormire! Ma il poveretto, vedendo che dama Luna era ancora alta nel cielo, se ne tornava a dormire brontolando con un raggio per capello. Ma poi dopo 15 minuti, giusto il tempo di riprendere il sonno da poco interrotto, ecco un altro sonoro chicchirichì echeggiare nell’aria. Comare Alba tornava a scuotere Messer Sole per spingerlo fuori dalla porta e questi, vedendo che insieme alla luna brillavano ancora tutte le stelle, tornava a letto sbraitando che non si capiva più nulla e a Pollaiopolis regnava l’anarchia, o come dicono loro, tutti avevano le creste fuori posto. Questa storia continuò a ripetersi tutte le notti, per diversi anni, finché comare Alba e sua figlia Aurora, stanche ed esasperate di tutto quell’inutile lavoro, decisero di mettersi un bel paio di tappi nelle orecchie e di dormire insieme a messer Sole, fino a quando quegli stupidi e litigiosi galli non si fossero messi d’accordo. Di conseguenza, a Pollaiopolis il sole non si alzò più, tutto degradava e la vita era divenuta molto triste. Senza messer Sole c’erano sempre buio e freddo! Gli alberi erano spogli di frutti, tutto era grigio e spoglio e sembrava lontano quando i galli avevano promesso di dare maggior colore e vita a Pollaiopolis con i loro chicchirichì. Pensate che perfino gli abitanti, cioè galli, polli, galline e pulcini, avevano perso i colori del loro piumaggio ed erano magri e malaticci. Ma un bel giorno arrivò a Pollaiopolis gallo Bargiglio che era emigrato tanti anni prima per l’isola Gallinara, quando ancora a Pollaiopolis sorgeva il sole. Gallo Bargiglio si rese conto che la situazione ed il degrado era insostenibile in quel piccolo paese e quando le galline le raccontarono l’assurda diatriba dei galli. Allora gallo Bargiglio volle convocare un’assemblea generale, per cercare di risolvere la questione. Quando tutti i pollaiopolesi si radunarono sul prato, sotto una pallida luce lunare, gallo Bargiglio disse che ha Pollaiopolis le cose vanno alla rovescia perché non c’è rispetto per chi cantava prima di loro, questi galletti sono arroganti ed incapaci, ma adesso pare che il primo galletto che si alza vuole dettare legge! Risentito dalle affermazioni di Bargiglio, un galletto il più giovane volle dire la sua affermando che erano loro che dovevano guidare, perché erano giovani e dalle rosse creste. Intervenne anche la gallina Piopio che chiocciò con la sua vocina a nome di tutte le galline che se qualcuno doveva comandare era lei ed il Comitato GGGG, acronimo di Galline Ganze Gaie Gigione, per il bene dei pulcini e di tutti gli abitanti di Pollaiopolis, promettendo che avrebbe regolato con una legge disciplinata da un regolamento soggetto ad interpretazioni il chicchirichì mattutino, la gallina Piopio si pensava furba ed istruita ma non vedeva il becchime fuori dalla ciotola (modo di dire a Pollaiopolis per indicare un pollo ottuso ndr). Riprese a parlare il gallo Bargiglio, affermando che era ora per salvare dalla rovina Pollaiopolis, un CIGIC, Comitato di Galline Industriose e Capaci per gestire con buon senso chi canta al mattino affermando che poi che i problemi di Pollaiopolis erano ben altro e non solo il chicchirichì mattutino! Tutti le galline e pulcini pigolando applaudirono ed i galli boriosi e la gallina Piopio lo a guardarono col becco storto, ma non ebbero il coraggio di fiatare. Gallo Bargiglio allora si staccò una penna dalla sua bella sua coda, la intinse nell’inchiostro e cominciò a scrivere su un foglio di carta i nomi di coloro che intendevano candidarsi a Capo Gran Gallo, per procedere ad una democratica elezione. Manco a dirlo, i galli si proposero tutti. Ciascuno di loro si fece la campagna elettorale, andando in giro per il pollaio a promettere becchime e insalata, modo di dire che corrisponde al nostro mari e monti. Uno, il gallo Brahma, grosso ed imponente diceva: “Se voterete per me il sole tornerà finalmente a sorgere ogni mattina!”, un altro gallo Concincina affermava che se votato non solo il sole tornerà a sorgere ad ogni alba, ma sarà puntuale come un orologio svizzero! Il galletto Sebright giovane ed arrogante diceva per farsi eleggere che se eletto non solo il sole sarebbe tornato a splendere in cielo, puntuale come un orologio svizzero, ma sarà addirittura più grande e radioso. Era una gara a chi la cantava più grossa, pensate che, addirittura, uno di loro il gallo Vorwerk, arrivò a dire che, se fosse stato eletto non solo avrebbe rispedito il sole a splendere in cielo, puntuale come un orologio svizzero, più grande e radioso che mai, ma avrebbe addirittura fatto sì che a uscire fossero due soli, invece di uno solo! Ma forse quello che perse il senso della misura fu il gallo Coccodè che con voce roboante chiedeva di essere eletto promettendo il levarsi del sole all’alba, puntuale sorgendo ad Ovest e non da Est perché il progresso era questo, rompere i vecchi schemi. Messer Sole, intanto, continuava a dormirsela beatamente nel suo letto, tanto era abituato a tutto quel coro di chicchirichì, che echeggiava continuamente da una parte all’altra di Pollaiopolis. Ad un tratto, quando gallo Bargiglio ne ebbe abbastanza di sentire tutto quel baccano, salì sul punto più alto di Pollaiopolis, una enorme ed imponete quercia e sfoderò il suo acuto chicchirichì. Allora tutti il chiacchiericcio dei galli cessò. Messer Sole si svegliò con un sobbalzo e, si affacciò a curiosare, rischiarando il buio di quella interminabile notte. I pollaiopolesi non credevano ai loro occhi, finalmente il sole tornava a illuminare la loro misera esistenza! Tutti i polli furono concordi nell’affermare che Bargiglio era un pollo dai fatti concreti, invece delle inutili chiacchiere degli altri galli. Ai galli concorrenti non rimase che calare la cresta e beccarsi i bargigli. Fu così che gallo Bargiglio venne acclamato da tutti polli nel ruolo più ambito, quello di svegliare il sole ogni mattina col suo Chicchiricchi!

The men's coxed four hit the course under the midday sun and the home favourite had Germans excited as they took the lead off the start. But could they hold off the fast-paced Irish and French crews? Coming into the second 1000 meters, the Germans took up their rate to try to break away, but it was the Italians who had started to move. France was quickly dropping back as Italy moved through and took the Irish with them. Into the final sprint, Germany had to pull out all the stops to win ahead of Italy and Ireland.

Amakhosi's failure to clinch the title title is expected to pile pressure on coach Ernst Middendorp. Chiefs have been linked to Gavin Hunt and now it looks likely that they'll go for the Bidvest Wits mentor.


 While Chiefs retained the same XI that beat nine-man Chippa United on Wednesday, Baroka reinstated Elvis Chipezeze in goal, with Ayanda Dlamini, who conceded four goals in their 4-1 defeat to SuperSport United midweek, dropping to bench.


 As there was undoubtedly a lot at stake for both sides, pressure was written in the faces of both Chiefs and Baroka mentors in Middendorp and Dylan Kerr respectively.


 Middendorp, clad in a formal white folded shirt, was hardly in his seat. The German coach cut a stressed figure in the dugout. Kerr, on the other hand, had his butt in the sit for the better part of the proceedings.


 Chiefs took the game to Bakgaga and Reeve Frosler was the talisman, making dashing moves to give Amakhosi the upperhand. The dominance by the Soweto outfit paid off in the 39th thanks to Khama Billiat's cool finish after a brilliant chest flick by Samir Nurkovic.


 In a synchronised match, Sundowns broke the deadlock via Maboe in the first period's stoppage time, having missed a penalty midway through the stanza. Maboe completed his brace seven minutes before the hour- mark.


 Downs’ Ricardo Nascimento saw his spot kick saved by Leopard's goalkeeper King Ndlovu as Sundowns dominated from the first until the final whistle.


 Having been struggling this season, the Brazilians’ skipper Hlompho Kekana was in his element yesterday, dictating terms in the middle of the park.


 Back to Chiefs' game, Baroka drew level just a minute before the hour-mark. Bakgaga netted through Manuel Kambala, who nodded home from a Gerald Phiri's free-kick.


 In the relegation battle Polokwane City suffered the misfortune having to campaign in the first division next season while Leopards finished 15th to secure the playoffs spot. Rise and Shine lost 2-1 to Bidvest Wits. In the round robin playoffs, Lidoda Duvha will face Ajax Cape Town and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila.

While it's important to install carefully to avoid filament feed issues, it's an easy way to automatically clean filament during the printing process. You may be surprised just how dirty your filament gets after sitting on the shelf for a few months. Getting rid of such contamination decreases the likelihood of annoying problems like delaminations and jams. Avid printers may also want to consider making their own filament, too. Happy printing!

“I would just like to watch him every week, go to games and see him in the flesh and analyse him. I’d be delighted if City get him at some point in the next year.
 “This might sound strange, but I probably wouldn’t want Liverpool to sign Messi. I just feel Liverpool are more about the team ethic than a City side that relies on individuals to produce moments of magic. Also, the financial figures we are hearing are just mind-blowing and I wonder how it would affect that Liverpool dressing room if a deal like that was done.”
 This is arguably a big misunderstanding about Messi, with the forward very unlike Cristiano Ronaldo in that he contributes in many areas on the pitch, even if it’s the goals and moments of individual skill that he’s more well known for.
 It’s also simplistic to say City rely on individuals for success, with Pep Guardiola possessing quality players all over the pitch who all play their part. Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero perhaps stand out a little more than others, but there rarely seems a reliance on any individual in this City side.
