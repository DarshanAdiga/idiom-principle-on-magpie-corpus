During the “Scene Stealers” episode, Dever realized she was wearing the same bright pink dress that she wore to her audition. She read that day in front of an all-female creative team including Timberman, showrunner Susannah Grant and executive producer/director Lisa Cholodenko. Dressing the part of a typical young woman going about her day, Dever fit the bill for the survivors at the center of the series, which made casting all the more chilling for Kostenbauder. “Especially with this case, it was an everywoman,” she says. “It was really important to make sure that it was done correctly and getting those real faces, not just a shiny Hollywood piece.”

Using the seventh anniversary of Rana Plaza and the COVID-19 pandemic as lenses through which to evaluate concrete change, several recent articles sharply contradicted the optimistic first quarterly report. Specifically, the articles mirrored IndustriAll in noting that the spread of COVID-19 led fashion brands to mass-cancel orders already produced or in production, without considering the devastating impact of unpaid wages to the garment workers. A recent Forbes article noted that the responses from global brands have run the gamut with some companies, such as H&M and Uniqlo, agreeing to pay for the costs of work in progress or completed and other companies informing their suppliers that they have no intention of paying for work done.

The former police officer charged with killing George Floyd and three others accused of abetting the African American's murder were to appear in court Monday, in a case that has touched off a global reckoning over racial inequality.
 Derek Chauvin, the 44-year-old white officer who was filmed pressing his knee into Floyd's neck, was scheduled to be the first to appear at 1715 GMT by videolink from the high security prison where he is being held.
 Chauvin, whose bail has been set at a million dollars, is charged with second degree murder for the death of 46-year-old Floyd, who was unarmed and handcuffed as Chauvin kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes.
 Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, and will appear in person in court.
 The first two were released on a bail of $750,000.
 The four former police officers, who face up to 40 years behind bars, will have the chance to plead guilty or not guilty at the hearing.
 The court could also rule on whether they will stand trial separately or together.
 The four men detained Floyd on May 25 in Minneapolis on suspicion of trying to use a fake $20 bill in a store.
 "I can't breathe," Floyd said on several occasions before losing consciousness.
 Chauvin ignored bystanders who begged him to remove his knee, while one of them filmed the incident on a cell phone. The footage went viral, triggering the largest wave of protests demanding racial equality and police reform in decades.
 \- Police reforms -
 Anger exploded in the streets of major cities across the United States as the justice system was seen as slow to react to the killing.
 The police department sacked the four officers but the Minneapolis attorney general's office waited four days before charging Chauvin with manslaughter, and did not initially charge his three colleagues.
 The case was then reassigned to the Minnesota state attorney general's office.
 An independent autopsy later revealed that Floyd died of suffocation due to the police officer's pressure on his neck and cited the cause of death as "homicide."
 The charges against Chauvin were increased to second-degree homicide and his three colleagues were also charged with "aiding and abetting" the murder.
 Although Floyd's family welcomed the new charges, protests and clashes with the police continued to rock the country.
 The demands of the protesters grew from mere justice for Floyd to calls for sweeping reform of law enforcement, an end to racial inequality and for the US to acknowledge its history of slavery and racial injustice.
 The demands bore fruit when some police departments banned "choke hold" restraints during arrests, while others pledged to allow access to records of previous complaints against officers who find themselves accused of abuse of power.
 The Minneapolis city council even decided to disband its troubled force and rebuild its law enforcement from scratch.
 Progress on the federal level has been far more halting, however.
 President Donald Trump, in his campaign for re-election, has focused on the violent fringes of the protests, and on damage caused by demonstrators who have at times torn down statues of Confederate generals who fought for the slave-holding South in America's Civil War.
 The president has frequently made calls on social media for "law and order."

"Few studies have evaluated whether the effects are similar in different racial or ethnic groups," Anstey said. "This [finding] raises the possibility that ethnic groups vary in their vulnerability to the cognitive effects of alcohol."
 "This may make sense due to higher likelihood of medical comorbities like diabetes in Blacks," said Isaacson.
 However, Anstey cautioned, there are founding factors to consider before defaulting to any conclusions that drinking varies by race.
 "Patterns of alcohol drinking are associated with socio-economic status and other cultural factors," she said. "It is very difficult to disentangle the biological from social mechanisms at play here."
 In the end, this new study doesn't change what most doctors already recommend, experts say.
 "In my clinical practice, I look at the totality of evidence and then individualize recommendations for the person being cared for," Isaacson said.
 For women, a general maximum target is about four to six drinks per week in his Alzheimer's prevention clinic, he said. In men that would be 10 to 12 servings per week.
 "But this is not a 'one size fits all' choice," Isaacson added. "These decisions should be tailored based on body weight, for example, and also modified based on whether the person has a history of alcohol or substance abuse.
 "Further, it's not just about 'what and how much' alcohol, it's also important to consider 'when and how' the alcohol is consumed, Isaacson said.
 For example, having a glass of wine with an early dinner is "more sensible than two glasses late at night on an empty stomach close to bedtime," he said.
 "Alcohol before bed has the tendency to lead to poorer overall quality sleep, which also impacts dementia risk," he added.
 "I believe for those who drink alcohol, they should follow the national guidelines as a guide to the maximum level of safe drinking," said Anstey, adding that this would not apply to anyone with a health condition that calls for alcohol abstinence.
 And if you aren't a drinker, don't start, she said.
 "Alcohol consumption, for example, increases the risk of some cancers. If one doesn't drink, then we would not recommend taking up alcohol drinking."
