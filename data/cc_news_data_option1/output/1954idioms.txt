That season, the Blackhawks were particularly good, winning the Patoka Lake Athletic Conference, then a sectional title. Burton became a solid piece of Valley’s squad defensively as one of five players who finished the season with more than 100 digs. Then, in the regional championship match against Barr- Reeve, she tore the same ACL that had been surgically repaired just nine months earlier. She wouldn’t make it onto the basketball court nor the softball diamond.
 “To tear it again two weeks before [basketball] practice was supposed to start and lose her for a full season, that was rough,” Ellison’s father and Springs Valley assistant girls’ basketball coach Chris Burton said. “I think that would’ve been a good year for us as a team, I think we probably could’ve gotten that sectional [championship].”
 Nevertheless, Ellison persisted. A December surgery removed the parts left behind from her first knee operation and refilled holes in her bone. Her knee was closed up and she spent three months healing.
 In March, she went under the knife again and her ACL was replaced. Months of healing and rehab later, she was ready to take the floor for her junior season of volleyball.
 “She never put her head down, she just went back to work,” Chris said. “It was never a ‘Why me?’ It was an ‘I need to get back to work so I can get back on the court.’”
 Once again, she made an impact for Springs Valley, remaining a part of the squad’s regular rotation as the Blackhawks won the conference again while posting a 27-5 record overall.
 In the winter, she finally made it back to the basketball court. As a member of a veteran core of players, she helped the ‘Hawks to a 17-8 record and a sectional title game appearance, averaging 11.9 points and a team-high 4.4 assists per game
 That spring, she finally made her varsity softball debut, bashing opposing pitching to the tune of a team-high .474 batting average and an on-base plus slugging of .991.
 For the first time in years, she finally got a full summer to work out and improve without worrying about recovering from an injury. It paid dividends when her senior year started.
 She tallied a career-high 225 digs in her final volleyball season as the Blackhawks once again won the conference, then their second sectional title in three years before falling to eventual state runner-up Trinity Lutheran in the regional championship game.

I've said all along that the video going viral was a planned event, and it turns out that I was correct. The ever-astute Anna Merlan discovered that an ex-Google employee and QAnon believer named Zach Vorhies conceived and executed a plan to make the video go viral, and it worked. She also reported that Vorhies has ties to the antivaccine movement, including Del Bigtree and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., having appeared on The Highwire With Del Bigtree as the "Google whistleblower" who, apparently, revealed Google's nefarious plans to alter its search algorithms to deprioritize antivaccine misinformation. It was Vorhies, in fact, who introduced Mikovits to Mikki Willis, the filmmaker who produced the video and served as her interviewer.

Black people, for instance, have so far made up 25 percent of the deaths in this country from the virus, nearly twice their numbers in the general population. In New York alone, as the disease engulfed the city, black and Latino residents are estimated to have perished at twice the rate of whites. In states like Michigan and Illinois, the disparities have been similarly pronounced, while unemployment rates among African Americans now overshadow that of whites to a degree that is breathtaking. William Rodgers, former chief economist at the Department of Labor, has estimated that as early as March, the real unemployment rate for African Americans may already have climbed to 19 percent and has only increased since.

The Portland Gale of 1898 is remembered as the deadliest weather event in New England maritime history. The Thanksgiving weekend storm claimed over 450 lives along the coast, including 192 aboard the doomed steamer S.S. Portland.
 Forty other vessels were destroyed or damaged, including the 344-ton schooner Albert L. Butler near the Peaked Hill Lifesaving Station in Provincetown on the morning of November 27, 1898. Two of the crew and a passenger were lost.
 "The sailors perished as a result of their own rashness and lack of self possession, when they might have certainly have been saved," according to the U.S. Lifesaving Service report of 1899.
 "The passenger, from Jamaica, fell from the rigging while the schooner was plunging shoreward, and was beyond any help either from the vessel or the land. The sailors perished as a result of their own rashness and lack of self possession, when they might have certainly have been saved. The passenger, from Jamaica, fell from the rigging while the schooner was plunging shoreward, and was beyond any help either from the vessel or the land."
 The Butler, with a crew of seven, was heading from Jamaica to Boston with a full cargo of logwood. Already having encountered rough seas, the storm intensified as the vessel was 40 miles off Highland Light in Truro. After more progress to the north, the ship was driven by northeast gales toward shore. Captain Frank Leland figured that his ship "made a dead drift of about 15 miles."
 By 7 a.m. the next morning, the ship was approaching Peaked Hill Bars, considered to be one of the deadliest stretches along the Atlantic coast. Leland described the sea as "frightful, the biggest I ever saw, and the gale swept us at its mercy."
 The vessel drifted for three hours until about 10 a.m., when "the shore breakers were under her forefoot, and she swung broadside high onto the beach."
 While on patrol, Peaked Hill surfman B.F. Henderson and High Head surfman Benjamin Kelley spotted the Butler when she struck the sandbar, and quickly relayed the information to the Peaked Hill Station. Shortly after 11 a.m., the apparatus was ready at the wreck scene. Keeper Cook fired two shots from the Lyle gun from a high bank, and a sailor on board the Butler began to fasten the whip line. However, he failed to do so efficiently, and the man ended up being dragged through the breakers to shore.
 Shortly after, the mizzen mast gave way and crashed, fouling the rigging and whip line. Two men panicked, and, despite warning from the surfmen, tried to go in as the man before them did. As the keeper said, "A big sea, I should say 20 feet high, rolled in and buried the vessel, men and everything. I had hold of the whip line, and could feel when the sailors lost their grasp. They were washed off, and that was the last we knew of them."
 Leland washed ashore on a piece of wreckage. He and two other men were pulled up while trying to climb the bank.
 "If they (the lost men) had worked the lifesaving lines properly, they would doubtless have been saved," said Leland. "They were all used up and badly scared, hardly in a condition to do things in an orderly and sensible way."
 By day's end on November 27, debris, lifejackets and bodies from the S.S. Portland began washing ashore in the same location. The wreck remained on the beach for several weeks, with the masts and fittings stripped by Cape wreckers.

OTTAWA - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada's bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council is more relevant now because of the need to rebuild the world after the COVID-19 crisis subsides.
 Trudeau is drawing a direct link between the pandemic and the aftermath of the Second World War, when Canada played a role in the founding of the UN, the Bretton Woods global financial institutions and other multilateral organizations such as NATO.
 As was the case in the 1940s, Canada has a role to play in creating a better, fairer world and winning a spot on the UN's most powerful body is one way to do that after the pandemic, the prime minister says.
 Canada is competing against Norway and Ireland for a two-year temporary seat on the council that would begin next year.

During these chaotic times, Earth Day strolled in, meandered briefly and slipped out the back barely being noticed. Many people I know give little thought to humanity's complete failure as the dominant species on this planet. Earth Day to them boils down to so many words.
   
 Michigan cinematographer Michael Moore, with Jeff Gibbs and Ozzie Zenher, combined words with images and delivered a provocative movie on Earth Day, "Planet of the Humans." It's an eye-opener dealing with the current status of the environmental movement and alternative energy. It's intended to be provocative and can be seen free on YouTube. It argues the infinite growth of capitalism is a plague and alternative energy is not the antidote. Like an open sore, energy is just an obvious symptom of the disease.
   
 The movie is a wake-up call for anyone who thinks the Democrats are dramatically different from the Republicans. Neither party will do much to change the direction this country/world is headed. The Green New Deal sounds great but at what pace will that happen? The majority of Democrats have never met a war they didn't like as they keep writing checks to bail out the bloated Pentagon. It's pointless to focus on replacing a million internal combustion engine autos with a million electric vehicles when America is on the verge of war with Venezuela and Iran.
   
 It's futile to depend on companies like General Electric for wind turbines as GE was one of the lead corporations which forced nuclear energy upon us. A new generation of mini-nukes are in the works at lesser known companies and I suggest we prepare to oppose that effort right out of the gate. Profit driven energy just got a $200 billion bailout; wind and solar nothing.
   
 Massive centralized wind and solar farms controlled by utilities are good PR for those utilities as they generate profits for the 1%. I'm certain Michael, Ozzie and Jeff support wind and solar at the individual consumer level and I'm certain they'd agree every home should to an extent be its own generating station.
   
 I believe those three guys would support a network of underground, vacuum tube, magnetic levitation bullet trains crisscrossing the country three times faster than aircraft. Fuel-guzzling air travel could be drastically reduced. Imagine cities spread out with huge central parks for individual gardening with no roads for autos. Buildings engineered with all the windows solar panels to harvest sunshine.
   
 Reintegration with the natural environment will take effort. Solar energy steadily improves but, like everything, renewable energy has its flaws. The largest solar panel factory (First Solar) on this side of the planet is just south of Toledo. At some point, a transition will take place where alternative energy will be prevalent enough to the point solar energy will supply energy to produce solar panels. We have to be realistic; can't just shut down all power generating stations at once so, which is first? Bio-mass, corn based ethanol, coal, nuclear, or unnatural gas?
   
 We have to demand the Republicrats stop spending a trillion dollars a year conducting genocide around the planet over oil. The Donald is disconnected from reality. His idea to have military aircraft fly over cities as a tribute to health care workers is insane. It costs $70,000 an hour to fly a B-52, the bomber that might arrive after the final war is over. The combined Blue Angels/Thunderbirds flyovers (12 aircraft) are scheduled for 22 cities. If those millions of dollars were used to supply protective equipment to medical staff, I'm sure they'd be really impressed.
   
 Population growth is a symptom of capitalism encouraged by organized religion. At some point people have to examine their sacred cows and admit Judeo/Christian values are a flawed cornerstone for the dead-end foundation we call western civilization. The sands of time will topple our reality at some point. There are too many people on the planet placing too much demand on the ecosystem.
   
 I support the message put forth by "Planet of the Humans." I support Planned Parenthood and I suggest everybody replace all their incandescent lights with LED bulbs.

When shooting in a small room, presumably one that is dimly lit, your best means of adding light will be via bounced on-camera flash.Gear - Your options for on-camera flashes will vary depending on your camera body and budget, but a basic 50-60 watt-second pocket strobe like the Canon Speedlite 600EX II-RT or Yongnuo's budget-friendly version of the flash should do the trick. We also recommend adding a modifier to soften and help spread the light, such as a "Fong Dong" or MagMod's MagSphere.Surfaces - While using a bounce flash requires a minimal setup time of under a minute, it also requires a neutral- color ceiling/wall. If the ceiling/wall does not have a neutral color, you may need to use a reflector or consider using direct flash (although this less likely in a small room).Rim lighting - Rim lighting can be added with additional off-camera flashes if using the on-camera bounce flash as a master, but setting up the rim lights and stands will add a minute or two to the overall setup.Limited movement - Because your light source is on-camera, your range of movement is limited. If you back away from your subjects, for example, then less light will reach them. At the same time, the subjects closest to the light source will be brighter than those in the background. Get your flash settings dialed in at an established distance and then keep it consistent thereafter.

On May 15, Purdue Extension in West Lafayette announced that county 4-H fairs would be allowed after Purdue University’s restrictions on face-to-face events end June 30. The decision gave the green light to local 4-H fair boards, 4-H councils and county extension educators to continue planning during June, in concert with local health officials, for events that would align with Indiana’s Back on Track plan.
 Under the state plan, County 4-H fairs may begin on July 4, if local health officials confirm the county has reached stage five. Fairs must adhere to social distancing guidelines, screen employees and volunteers working on behalf of Purdue Extension daily, disinfect high traffic areas using industry best practices, and offer hand sanitizer and cleaning stations to employees and guests.
 “Purdue Extension will comply with all federal, state and local regulations and public safety guidelines and will adhere to Purdue University policies for public health and safety,” said Jason Henderson, senior associate dean of the College of Agriculture and director of Purdue Extension. “The Back on Track plan provides guidelines which will be followed to ensure the safety of our 4-H’ers, families and communities.”

Deputies found Essence Stroman dead inside a bedroom Sunday evening. The bodies of Shanta Singleton and Tre´vay Stroman were outside next to a gold Honda Accord. Jordan's body was nearby, with a pistol on the ground between his legs, deputies said.
 Jordan, 37, killed himself, the sheriff and Calhoun County Coroner Donnie Porth agreed. The bodies are to undergo autopsy in the coming days.
 Jordan and Shanta Singleton had dated on and off for years.
 Summers called it a 'domestic violence argument that went really bad'.
 According to the police report he is still registered to the same address as the victims. Singleton registered at the address a year ago.
 A Bugleflower Lane neighbor - who didn't know the victims well but knew Singleton's mother, grandmother and extended family - said, 'It’s just sad.'
 'I really can’t even process what happened, ' Linda Grant said. 'It’s bad enough when adults are involved, but when children are involved, that’s just hard to break it.'
 'I know that the family is a good family. She comes from a good family.'

And the Vaccine Court supports this, only about 1 case in 1 million vaccines. And, as I've written before, there are law firms willing to represent families who believe their child was harmed by vaccines because the Vaccine Court pays them reasonable amounts. They have nothing to lose. On the other hand, if one sued the company without overwhelmingly strong evidence, it would take years with only modest chance of winning. The Vaccine Court makes it easy to sue, not only paying lawyers; but witnesses, and to some extent they err on the side of the plaintiff, that is, if a possible adverse event connected to a vaccine, even if not clear was caused in specific instance, they rule in favor of plaintiff and because the serious injuries involve often a lifetime of care, the payouts are quite good, sometimes well over one million dollars and all goes to the plaintiffs, the lawyers don't take 40% or more. For example, from 2006 thru 2014 there were a total of 3,672 cases which the Court rules in favor of 2,310, about 2/3 of cases. The total number of vaccines given during that time period was 2,532,428,541. You do the math.

5\. How To Photograph GroomsmenGroomsman portraits can make for some of the most fun and interesting images from the day. Just remember, whether they're posing like GQ editorial models or goofing around, use lighting, posing, framing, or other means to ensure that the groom doesn't get lost in the group.Here are some tips for photographing the groom and his groomsmen.Indoor and/or Outdoor Portraits - For indoor portraits, choose a location with great lighting, possibly near a large window (or several), and make sure that the background is clean. Having great lighting and a clean background is also ideal when shooting outdoors, so be sure to scout ahead of time and use apps like Sun Seeker to ensure the lighting will be optimal in the location you've chosen.Candid and/or Posed Portraits - Candid and posed portraits are not always exclusive of one another. When the action is slow, create shots of the groom and groomsmen by directing the scene and prompting the action (gift exchanges, toasts, card games, etc).Dramatic vs. Soft Lighting - While you could go the "standard" route and use an umbrella or big soft box to get soft, diffused light over the entire group, you might also consider capturing an image or two using dramatic lighting, especially if you're using editorial- style posing.See three ways to photograph groups with flash here.Individual Portraits of the Groom with Each Groomsman - In addition to photographing the groom with his group of groomsmen, be sure to capture images of the groom with each individual groomsmen. Generally, try to capture at least one standard pose and one funny pose (see images below).You can find specific posing cues for grooms and groomsmen here.

“It’s a natural experiment, in a way,” said Matthew Nock, a psychology professor at Harvard. “There’s not only an increase in anxiety, but the more important piece is social isolation.” He added, “We’ve never had anything like this — and we know social isolation is related to suicide.”
 The earliest signs of whether the pandemic is driving up suicides will likely emerge among those who have had a history of managing persistent waves of self-destructive distress. Many of these people, who number in the millions worldwide, go through each day compulsively tuned to the world’s casual cruelties — its suspicious glances and rude remarks — and are prone to isolate themselves, at times contemplating a final exit plan.
 “That’s how I am,” said Josh, 35, a college instructor in North Carolina who has been consumed in the past with thoughts of suicide. “I see all the bad, the suffering, and I have a tendency to crawl into a hole. Now, with this COVID threat, we’re being told to isolate and stay away from others. It’s like, ‘Oh, I was right all along, and the world was crazy.’”
 He added, “I haven’t backslid, I haven’t moved. But longer term — I don’t know.” He asked that his last name be omitted for privacy.
 Research done in the wake of natural disasters offers little guidance as to how this group will respond. In a widely cited 1999 paper in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, in communities hit by an earthquake, flood or hurricane, rates of suicide spiked in the years after. But the study authors later retracted that finding, after discovering an error that, when corrected, revealed “no significant increase in suicide rates after natural disasters, either for all types of disasters combined or for individual types of disasters.” Other studies have found increases, or decreases, depending on the group and disaster studied.
 The evidence is stronger when it comes to the impact of economic hardship. Suicide rates in the United States have risen steadily since 2000 — by 35% overall, across most age groups — but the rate of increase roughly doubled in the wake of the 2008 downturn. Historically, the job losses, evictions and displacements caused by recessions tend to lead to an increased numbers of suicides.
 “I think during the actual crisis, suicide will be lower,” said Dr. Marianne Goodman, a psychiatrist at the Department of Veterans Affairs, in the Bronx. “And once the longer-term economic impact is felt, I suspect, suicide will be rising again.”
 But the imminent threat of a potentially deadly virus is very different, psychologically, from the exhausting anxiety of facing a future with few job prospects. The descent of a pandemic alters the thinking and behavior of distressed people in ways that are simply not well understood.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our lives and country as no other event has in recent history.
   
 Health care providers met the virus head on to care for those infected. Manufacturers pivoted their production lines to help provide the much need protection products and medical supplies. Other companies found new ways to provide goods and services. All acted without hesitation, amid a cloud of unclear and shifting rules and requirements placed on businesses, because it was for the good of our country and fellow Americans.
   
 While our country currently faces a health crisis in its battle against COVID-19, an economic crisis also has gripped our lives, largely because of government-issued orders that closed or restricted businesses and forced millions of Americans out of work.
   
 Cautiously, Kansas and other states are beginning to reopen their economies. During Gov. Laura Kelly's Phase 1 of her reopen plan, the state's business community proved its commitment to reopening and to safely bringing back their employees and serving their customers.
   
 There is no doubt it is in the best interests of businesses to keep their customers and employees safe. Unfortunately, it has become clear there are those who seek to penalize businesses with frivolous lawsuits.
   
 Current liability laws cover some aspects of COVID-19. At issue, however, is the lack of consistent expectations of what defines sufficient safeguards businesses should follow. Each day seems to bring new government guidelines. Don't wear masks. Everyone wears masks. Everyone closes. Some can open. Changing timelines to open, etc.
   
 The Kansas business community supports liability protection that uses government guidance to define the standard of care and provide some certainty that if companies follow the applicable guidance at the time, they will not be liable.
   
 Medical liability protection, premise liability protection and product liability protect are all crucial elements to this vital legislation.
   
 We ask the Kansas Legislature and Gov. Kelly to support the state's businesses and workers by passing targeted, commonsense reforms to protect against abuses of the legal system that would punish businesses who are working tirelessly to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and who are opening their doors after being shuttered by government orders.
   
 Companies that act in good faith to protect employees and follow available guidelines should not be exposed to costly legal fees for trying to do the right thing. Conversely, providing businesses with targeted and limited liability protections is not the same thing as shielding companies from liability for bad acts. We do not seek reforms that would protect businesses that operate in reckless or intentional disregard of available guidance.
   
 The Kansas business community is ready to get the Kansas economy growing again. Those businesses who carefully adhere to government guidelines and regulations for the safety of their employees, vendors and customers should not be subjected to the threat of frivolous lawsuits. This commonsense legislation is vital to Kansas economic recovery.

 The spring high-school sports season is usually a crazy race to the finish with athletes cramming in a wild month-and-a-half of activity leading up to the state tournaments.
 It's usually the most hectic time of the year for athletic directors as they try to manage schedules for numerous sports all the while dealing with the uncertainty of the Minnesota spring weather.
 In a sad twist of fate, the spring has been beautiful, and the local teams could've been out performing and on schedule only to have the season forfeited due to COVID-19.
 My heart goes out to the seniors who will be unable to finish out their careers competing.
 I know how important it was to me, playing golf in the spring for the Cardinals way back in the day under Coach Ed Braland.
 Sports is a big part of our existence in these small towns, you don't necessarily think about it until there are no high school sports, the RACC and other workout facilities are shut down, city recreation activities cease, the golf course is closed, etc. etc.
 As I mentioned in an earlier column, the opening of the local golf courses has been a godsend to many. It's a great opportunity to get out of the house and enjoy the beautiful spring that we've been afforded this year.
 The Redwood Falls Golf course is in great shape for mid-May and has enjoyed some steady play, including new players who have decided to pick up the sport as a way to get through this unique time we're living in.
 Like most businesses, the golf courses are still in the early phase of being open while respecting the idea of social distancing and protecting the safety of the public.
 Hopefully, at some point here the clubhouses can reopen to allow patrons in to enjoy the bar services and beautiful scenic view that only the Redwood Falls Golf Club deck can provide.
 Whether or not the club will be able to host tournaments at some point this summer is still up in the air.
 The annual Palmer Kise Invitational began in 1939 - won by namesake Palmer Kise - and has played continuously except for 1943 and 1957 and is in jeopardy of not being played this year.
 On a larger scale, the PGA tour is slated to kick off its season here soon.
 My twin brother Andy - the head golf pro at the TPC Harding Park in San Francisco - would've just wrapped up hosting the PGA Championship this past weekend.
 The event, like everything else, was put on hold and fortunately rescheduled for Aug. 3-9 and will be the first major of the year for the PGA tour.
 TPC Harding Park just recently reopened to golfers but to stringent rules regarding social distancing with San Francisco a ground zero for the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The Twins could be back in business here as well as MLB continues to try to piece together a schedule and logistics when it comes to when and where teams would potentially play.
 The same goes for the NBA and NHL although I think it will be much more difficult to get both of those two leagues going at this point even if you went straight into playoff action.

PEARL, Miss. (AP) — A man accused of sexually assaulting two young girls and tying up and beating their grandmother in her apartment was caught naked in the attic of the home, police in Mississippi said.
 Keith Lamar Reeder, 46, fought with the Pearl police officer who found him in the attic Saturday afternoon, and the two fell through the ceiling before Reeder was arrested, news outlets reported.
 The grandmother, a 54-year-old woman, called 911 to report a man had forced his way into her home, beat her and tied her up, officials said. She was able to free herself to call dispatchers, and was beaten again when the man discovered her on the phone, according to police.
 The woman told investigators the man had sexually assaulted her granddaughters, who are both 12 or younger, according to Pearl city spokesman Greg Flynn.
 Authorities have not determined any connection or relationship between Reeder and the victims, Flynn said.

Probably most difficult part of concert photography is coping with the constantly changing lighting. Concert lighting technicians give no mind to how difficult they make our lives as they try to make the show "look cool." Bottom line is you will have a lot of ruined shots simply because the stage lighting is constantly changing and moving all over the place. So here is what you can do:1. Shoot in manual mode. This is perhaps the most important concert photography tip. As the lighting is constantly shifting, don't even bother with using any camera mode other than manual. Using aperture, shutter or any automatic mode will result in very inconsistent exposures.2. Spot meter to the subject (i.e. the lead performer). Typically the lead performer will always be well lit throughout the performance. It is important to meter to the lead performer since, if you are metering on the scene, most of the time your lead performer will be completely blown (over exposed).3. Focusing on the subject in low light. If you are having a hard time gaining focus, you can either switch manual (obviously), or try focusing on your subject when they are well lit. Then, once you are focused on the right subject, turn off auto-focus on the lens to prevent it from trying to refocus. This technique works best when on a tri-pod and when you are not needing to constantly zoom in and out.

"Flush with electoral success, the BJP is now emboldened to the point where it no longer feels the need to dissemble its real agenda: the transformation of India into a Hindu Rashtra, where all religious minorities Muslims, Sikhs, Christiians, Dalits are relegated to second-class citizens.
 "In fact, the BJP would like to disenfranchise Indian Muslims entirely. In December, it passed a new law that would allow the government to strip Indian Muslims of their citizenship, and dispatch them to detention camps, which incidentally are already under construction.
 "The demonization of Muslims in India since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, therefore, is no surprise. The BJP has leapt at the opportunity to further stigmatize India already marginalized Muslim community by running campaigns on social media with inflammatory hashtags like #CoronaJihad. The result predictably is that at Muslims are being denied treatment in hospitals and assaulted on the streets." Meanwhile, the U.N. Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed concern about the new citizenship law, calling it 'fundamentally discriminatory. In April, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom criticized India for instituting national- level policies violating religious freedom across India, especially for Muslims.
 "Such statements are welcome but fall short of conveying the full extent of the dangers confronting South Asia today," Amb. Khan said.
 "Last year, Mr. Modi recklessly engaged in months-long brinkmanship with Pakistan that nearly led to war between the two nuclear powers," he wrote.
 "We only stepped back from the brink after Pakistan unconditionally returned an Indian pilot, who had been shot down after he intruded into Pakistani airspace, as a gesture of goodwill. Soon after his own election in July 2018, Prime Minister Imran Khan had promised India he would take two steps toward peace if India took one. Here he was, a few months later, living up to that pledge.
 "Mr. Modi, however, not only disregarded Pakistan peace overture just as he has snubbed all previous offers of dialogue by Pakkistan but continued to scare up the prospect of war with Pakistann until he had won his re-election.
 The world should, therefore, be more concerned that, having failed to break the will of the people in Kashmir and facing a faltering economy at home, Mr. Modi and the BJP may blunder and bluster their way into another co confrontation with Pakistan. The telltale signs India ressuscitation of the tired old canards about 'cross border terrorism' and the increasing adventurism of its military along the Line of Control are all there, if the world would heed them."

One of the most durable myths trafficked by so-called anti-vaxxers is that vaccines are scams developed by greedy pharmaceutical companies, abetted by a corrupt government, to make money from substances that do more harm than good.
 These claims have been repeatedly debunked, and studies show that vaccines are safe and effective. It’s also well documented that vaccines have saved untold numbers of humans from suffering and death from disease. Nevertheless, the fiction spread by anti-vaxxers continues to circulate and take hold among well-meaning, if gullible, people. The disinformation campaigns have done real harm, too, helping drive down rates of childhood immunizations and leading to the recent resurgence of measles in the U.S. and other countries.
 And lord help us if anything goes wrong with the COVID-19 vaccine itself.
 Although vaccines have been protecting people from deadly infectious diseases such as smallpox and influenza for centuries, they aren’t always benign and sometimes harm people they are intended to protect. The rush to develop a vaccine against polio in the 1950s had disastrous consequences. Some batches of the vaccine were found to be defective, but only after they had been rolled out in a mass immunization campaign. The bad batches caused 40,000 cases of polio, killing 10 children, leaving dozens more paralyzed and justifiably scaring the public about the safety of future vaccines.
 That incident led to much tighter regulation for vaccines, but it should stand as a good reminder that expediting vaccine development comes with risks. And the facts that the White House is calling the effort Operation Warp Speed, not Operation Save Lives, and aiming to produce 100 million doses by November suggest the motivation is meeting an artificial deadline, rather than developing a safe way to protect the public against the coronavirus.

You continue to ignore most of what I and others write, namely, that the vast majority of people still support vaccinations, that research around the world supports it. And, I did quite fine with all my vaccinations. In fact, I got many of them in one day walking down a corridor. Many years ago, after the U.S. abolished the draft, to get people to join the armed forces, among other things, they offered a chance to continue with a college education, even aboard Naval ships at sea, PACE (Program for Afloat College Education). For two years I taught undergraduate psychology courses on Naval ships in the Western Pacific. Prior to boarding my first ship, I got smallpox vaccine (3rd time), yellow fever, cholera, plague, typhoid/paratyphoid, dpt, polio, measles and some others. I must admit, both arms were sore and first night aboard ship had a low fever, so went down to corpsman, got two aspirins and fell asleep. Next day I was fine. And so were all the others who got the shots. Only one time since then did a shot bother me, the new shingles vaccine. My arm was sore for over a day and I felt so of out of it; but, having seen my grandparents and parents suffer through shingles, a day's sore arm, and malaise was well worth it. Something you and all antivaccinationists fail to understand, namely, just how serious many of the vaccine-preventable diseases are.

In light of the release of 10 faculty members including three from the welding program, Dodge City Community College announced an expanded schedule for its workforce development programs.
   
 "Many of the changes to our tech ed course offerings have been revised to encourage high school enrollment," said DCCC vice president of workforce development Dr. Clayton Tatro in a news release. "And we are actually offering free tuition to high school juniors and seniors who enroll in our workforce development programs."
   
 According to Tatro, DCCC will offer special cohort enrollments that give high school and post-secondary students more flexibility in course offerings, such as morning, afternoon, and full-day options as well as the changes to high school tuition rates.
   
 It had been previously announced during the April DCCC board of trustees meeting, the college board approved an expansion plan for the nursing program that will lease the former Learning Center facility on Frontview Street for its RN program.
   
 During the April meeting the board also approved two new courses that will begin in the fall of 2020. Those programs would be Electrical Technology and Climate Energy Control Technologies.
   
 "These new programs, like our existing programs, are open to both high school and post-secondary students," Tatro said. "On the high school side alone, we anticipate an enrollment of more than 150 students in our various programs."
   
 Additional expansion of courses will also be in the Allied Health building along with the changes to its welding program.
   
 "We've also purchased two day-cab semi-tractors for our CDL program," Tatro said. "This program, like our allied health, cosmetology and welding programs, will also see expansion in Fall 2020."
   
 According to DCCC president Dr. Harold Nolte, DCCC has developed a long-range strategic plan to address the needs of its current and future students.
   
 "This plan addresses student recruitment and retention, course offerings, programs, services and community needs," said Nolte. "Our current expansion of technical education programs is a great of example of where we are going as a college.
   
 "Our overall goal is to meet our students and community where they are. In order to do that, we have to make some changes, and that is exactly what we are doing."

 The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our lives and country as no other event has in recent history.
 Health care providers met the virus head on to care for those infected. Manufacturers pivoted their production lines to help provide the much need protection products and medical supplies. Other companies found new ways to provide goods and services. All acted without hesitation, amid a cloud of unclear and shifting rules and requirements placed on businesses, because it was for the good of our country and fellow Americans.
 While our country currently faces a health crisis in its battle against COVID-19, an economic crisis also has gripped our lives, largely because of government-issued orders that closed or restricted businesses and forced millions of Americans out of work.
 Cautiously, Kansas and other states are beginning to reopen their economies. During Gov. Laura Kelly's Phase 1 of her reopen plan, the state's business community proved its commitment to reopening and to safely bringing back their employees and serving their customers.
 There is no doubt it is in the best interests of businesses to keep their customers and employees safe. Unfortunately, it has become clear there are those who seek to penalize businesses with frivolous lawsuits.
 Current liability laws cover some aspects of COVID-19. At issue, however, is the lack of consistent expectations of what defines sufficient safeguards businesses should follow. Each day seems to bring new government guidelines. Don't wear masks. Everyone wears masks. Everyone closes. Some can open. Changing timelines to open, etc.
 The Kansas business community supports liability protection that uses government guidance to define the standard of care and provide some certainty that if companies follow the applicable guidance at the time, they will not be liable.
 Medical liability protection, premise liability protection and product liability protect are all crucial elements to this vital legislation.
 We ask the Kansas Legislature and Gov. Kelly to support the state's businesses and workers by passing targeted, commonsense reforms to protect against abuses of the legal system that would punish businesses who are working tirelessly to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and who are opening their doors after being shuttered by government orders.
 Companies that act in good faith to protect employees and follow available guidelines should not be exposed to costly legal fees for trying to do the right thing. Conversely, providing businesses with targeted and limited liability protections is not the same thing as shielding companies from liability for bad acts. We do not seek reforms that would protect businesses that operate in reckless or intentional disregard of available guidance.
 The Kansas business community is ready to get the Kansas economy growing again. Those businesses who carefully adhere to government guidelines and regulations for the safety of their employees, vendors and customers should not be subjected to the threat of frivolous lawsuits. This commonsense legislation is vital to Kansas economic recovery.

Juniper intends to spread the gospel of artificial intelligence across enterprise networking in the coming months with new products and services.
 The expected moves are a continuation of a strategy that has been an integral part of Juniper since the company bought wireless and artificial-intelligence software maker Mist in 2019 for $405 million.
 [Get regularly scheduled insights by signing up for Network World newsletters.]
 Mist’s cloud-based Wi-Fi Assurance system includes an AI-base engine called Marvis that features dynamic packet capture and machine learning to automatically identify, adapt to and fix network issues.
 Wi-Fi Assurance measures performance and service-level metrics to make wireless networks more predictable and reliable, and most recently its features have been expanded to include to include some of Juniper’s Junos- based wired-switch platforms.
 See more predictions about what's big in IT tech for the coming year.
 The continued “Mistifying” of Juniper and the increased use of AI were key topics of conversation at the networking vendor’s recent virtual AI event.
 “I think we are just scratching the surface of what we can do with real AI,” said Rami Rahim, CEO of Juniper. “As we continue to amass ever larger volumes of data – wireless and wired – it will lead to development of autonomous network actions we can take without human intervention in the cloud or at the edge.”
 Rahim called AI one of the most overhyped and underhyped technologies across a number of industries but said a variety of activities have come together to make it viable in networking. Those actions include access to ample compute power, the need to mine data as a precious resource – 90% of digital data has been generated in the past two years – and the open source software movement. “AI has been democratized by open source,” Rahim said.
 Algorithms and data are where the magic is for Juniper, Rahim said. “Mist was written during a scale-out era where the back-end was designed to consume mass volumes of data from thousands of Mist elements, and with every additional data point it gathers information that make it smarter. With that data Marvis understands what normal of the network looks like and can in many cases respond without a human intervention required.”
 Rahim cited some Juniper customers who’ve seen results with Marvis, including the retailer Gap, which saw a 97% improvement in point-of-sales system errors across its 1,500 stores, and Dartmouth College, which reported solving 75% of its helpdesk tickets with no human intervention.
 Dartmouth has a massive wireless network serving a peak of some 28,000 devices concurrently, according to Felix Windt, senior director, Network Services at Dartmouth who spoke during the Juniper event.
 AI finds the root cause of some big problems that would take a human many minutes or hours to figure out, and “we now have expert systems that can absolutely do that in seconds and do that proactively,” Windt said.
 “We are at a stage now where we are receiving telemetry from our wireless network that comes with actionable items that says, ‘Hey guys, you need to look at the DNS server,’ or ‘There is a problem with this particular RF in this building, and here’s what I would suggest’,” Windt said
 The Juniper/Mist combo means the IT department isn’t chasing down problems after they are reported, Windt said. “But rather we can proactively query specific individuals. You can run requests against Marvis where you can just [ask] who is doing the worst right now, and before [IT techs] have even contacted anybody I can get a list of the top 10 worst performers and look into how I might address their issues.”
 Looking forward, in the short term, Dartmouth is looking to bring its access layer switches under Marvis to get a handle on its wireless network.
 “After that I would be looking at AI and security, and longer term I would like to see a sort of federated AI where different vendors’ AI systems can talk to each other and share information,” Windt said.
 For Juniper’s part, it has begun moving some security support into Mist, and continued integration with its hardware lines is what customers will see this year.
 In February, Juniper said it would integrate its Security Intelligence (SecIntel) security package to the Mist platform for wireless access. SecIntel includes threat detection software, local and cloud-based security-information and control software with a next-generation firewall system.
 With the SecIntel integration, Mist customers can get threat alerts detected by Juniper SRX Series Firewalls and ATP Cloud, letting administrators quickly assess security risks when users and devices connect to wireless networks and take appropriate action such as quarantining devices or enforcing policies, Juniper said.
 Another future area of Mist AI integration will include Juniper’s SD-WAN technology, Rahim said.
 “Customers need the ability to assure solid connectivity across the entire path of network – that includes wireless and wired connections – and the path traffic takes from a particular location – be it at home or the data center or to the cloud – and it would be a natural extension to include the SD-WAN. That’s a work in progress,” Rahim said.

Vienna, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 19th May, 2020 ) :Renovation works at Auschwitz have turned up spoons, forks, cobbler's tools and other objects hidden beneath a chimney flue -- some that might have been used to plan escapes, a national fund said Tuesday.
 The objects, which also include knives, hooks, scissors, pieces of leather and parts of shoes, were found last month in block 17 of the main camp, Austria's National Fund for Victims of National Socialism said.
 The fund commissioned the renovation and restoration works in the block at the former concentration camp in Poland in preparation for an exhibition.
 "These utensils, kept out of sight of the SS guards, were perhaps used by shoemakers, or to prepare an escape or simply to be able to eat," fund secretary general Hannah Lessing told AFP on Tuesday.
 The items were likely hidden in the chimney because block 17 was used to house manual workers.

In a move that anticipates a business-as-usual stance for the NFL in wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Browns released times for their four preseason games Tuesday.
   
 The schedule, which features games against three NFC North teams, begins Aug. 15 with a 1 p.m. kickoff against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field. That is followed by a 2 p.m. game on Aug. 22 against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.
   
 The first preseason home game for the Browns at FirstEnergy Stadium takes place at 4 p.m. Aug. 30 against the Minnesota Vikings. That game, the consensus regular-season dress rehearsal, will be nationally televised on Fox. The Browns will face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at 7:30 p.m. Sept. 3 at home to close out the preseason.
   
 "Playing three NFC North teams, they're teams that are really well-coached," Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said in a release. "I'm looking forward to the competition and looking forward to that piece of it. The preseason is such a huge part of our development of our evaluation of our players when the young guys can get put under the lights. We're excited about those four games in the preseason."
   
 The Browns said in the release they and the NFL are monitoring the situation related to coronavirus and will provide refunds on tickets purchased directly from the team in the event of cancellations or should fan attendance be restricted "based on policies set by medical experts, government officials or the NFL."
