It's easily the least of the three films, but it's sweet and harmless and fun, and it's sort of refreshing to see a major studio movie that advocates for little more than simply being nice. After all, we still need to be excellent to each other, especially now. ♦

While watching know-it-all first-time parents get owned by their unpredictable offspring can be fun, there's not much enjoyment to be had in "Raised by Wolves"; not unless you refuse to take it as seriously as it takes itself. Sure, there's a sly sense of humor to Father constantly spouting dad jokes — "When is a door not a door? When it’s a jar." Yes, just like in real-life, they're not all winners — and the brainy, wimpy kid named Hunter, but most of the actual laughs are unintentional. In the pilot, Mother becomes so upset she actually howls (in case the title wasn't on the nose enough as-is), and she's often asked to "malfunction" when expressing emotion, which leads to weird, high-pitched shouts or other tonally jarring outbursts. Dedicated, admirable performances from Salim and especially Collin are also undercut by inconsistencies in their characters' development; these androids often act without emotion, yet whenever an emotional moment is necessary, they'll feel something.

PHILADELPHIA — Police on Thursday were seeking suspects after two teenagers were killed and two were wounded in a shooting that left the city's police commissioner "at a loss for words."
 Three gunman approached the victims and opened fire on Moore Street on Wednesday night, Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said.

A 17-year- old male was shot in the arm and an 18-year-old man was shot in the ankle. They were hospitalized in stable condition, and their names have not been released..

Filming originally kicked off earlier this year.

Now that we've thrown the worst pandemic of the last century into the mix, the how of seeing a new Christopher Nolan movie starts to get a little complicated, even for him. It starts to feel like less of a joke than a logic puzzle shaded with personal risk, unnerving self-doubt, and a certain moral dubiousness — one that's compounded if you crow about the experience afterward in a way that might inspire other people to follow suit. There’s no “right way” to eat popcorn at the moment — even if it’s much safer in countries with competent governments — and anyone craving a taste of “Tenet” has to adopt their own approach.

Christopher Nolan might be the rare auteur who has the power to compel the masses back to the multiplexes, but “Tenet” shouldn’t be framed as the only film capable of saving an entire tradition. For one thing, that narrative foments the kind of false urgency that might inspire someone to go to a theater against their better judgment. For another, the mere act of going to the movies after half a year of involuntary abstinence was enough to underscore why the theatrical experience isn’t just an inextricable part of the attraction, but also an invaluable attraction unto itself.

Welcome to Kepler-22b, an inhabitable planet left untouched by space travelers until an android's ship lands perilously close to a gaping hole in the ground. On board are Mother (Amanda Collin) and Father (Abubakar Salim), two semi-sentient robots clothed in shimmery, '80s-era bodysuits who've come to Kepler-22b in order to birth six human children of their very own. No, the androids can't procreate together, but they brought the necessary supplies in order to create six teeny babies. There are three boys and three girls, all of various ethnic backgrounds.

_This fall is definitely different for us this year. I would consider this COVID year without fall sports a blessing in disguise. My husband and I welcomed our first child on Aug. 11! At first, when we found out that we were pregnant and when our due date was, I was thinking, "Oh man. Right in the middle of pre-season camp. Looks like it will be a VERY busy fall for us!" [Johnson's husband is running backs coach for Whitworth.] I was excited to bring her around the team and take her to games for sure. Then COVID hit. It is such a weird time to be pregnant and have a newborn. But I can't say that I am at all upset that there is no football. My husband is not only home in the evenings now, but he is also working from home for his "day job" and is home all the time. I am able to take a few months off from work as well, and it has been such a blessing to be able to be home together with our daughter. It definitely has made this life transition easier for the two of us. So, in a nutshell, I am sad for the players, especially those seniors, that they do not get to have their typical fall season. But, slightly selfishly, it could not have come at a better time for our family. Come spring, I am hoping that we will be able to enjoy a football season to some degree. By then our daughter will be older and even more fun to take to games and cheer on the Pirates! ♦
