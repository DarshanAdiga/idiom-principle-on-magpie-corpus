If you’re put off by stuffy biodramas of kings and queens, don’t fear the period series “The Great.” Rest assured: so is the show’s creator.
 “I hate period things. Everything I wrote was contemporary,” says Tony McNamara, the Australian TV veteran and Oscar-nominated screenwriter of “The Favourite.” So of course his new Hulu show is set in 1740s Russia and is about Catherine (you know, _... the Great_ ). “I read about her and thought, ‘I really want to write about her. … What would it take for me to like it?’"
 “The Great” is a splash of cold water to the face of the “Masterpiece Theater” crowd and straight-no-chaser to “The Lion in Winter” fans, who like their royals sniping and snarling, but impeccably written all the same. It’s shockingly direct, even abrupt, but all in service of a compelling narrative with a whole country at stake. Just don’t take it as, shall we say, biographically precise.
 “If you’re slavish to the facts, it can really hurt the drama. I was more, ‘What’s the essence of her? What’s the reason I want to tell the story? She did this, she did this, she did this’ — and the rest is up for grabs,” says the writer from his backyard via video conference.

BALTIMORE - U.S. retail sales jumped by a record 17.7% from April to May, with spending partially rebounding after the coronavirus had shut down businesses, flattened the economy and paralyzed consumers during the previous two months.
 The Commerce Department’s report Tuesday showed that retail sales have retraced some of the record-setting month-to-month plunges of March (8.3%) and April (14.7%) as businesses have increasingly reopened. Still, the pandemic’s damage to retail sales remains severe, with purchases still down 6.1% from a year ago.
 The virus-induced recession not only diminished spending in most sectors of the economy. It has also accelerated shifts in where people shop and what they buy.
 The changes have in many cases intensified the financial strain on traditional physical stores and boosted online purchases. Sales at non-store retailers, which include internet companies like Amazon and eBay, rose 9% in May after posting growth of 9.5% in April. Clothiers achieved a stunning 188% monthly gain, but that was not enough to offset a 63.4% drop over the past 12 months.
 Retail sales account for roughly half of all consumer spending, which fuels about 70% of total economic activity. The rest of consumer spending includes services, from cellphone and internet contracts to gym memberships and child care.
 Last month's bounce-back comes against the backdrop of an economy that may have begun what could be a slow and prolonged recovery. In May, employers added 2.5 million jobs, an unexpected increase that suggested that the job market has bottomed out.
 Nearly 80% of small retailers and restaurants tracked by the scheduling tool Homebase that were closed in mid-April have since reopened. Yet these smaller businesses remain under pressure. Their stresses in part reflect changes emerging as social distancing has become essential and shopping habits evolve.
 One such retailer, CPW, a women’s clothing store, has been in business for 30 years on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. A three-month shutdown resulting from the virus sent the store’s sales sinking 20% to 30% even as the owner, Linda Wolff, packed and delivered orders to customer homes. Though CPW reopened for curbside pickup a week ago, Wolff said she hasn’t rung up a single such sale.
 “This is my heart and soul,” she said. “I am exhausted from all the worrying.”
 Some national chains, by contrast, say they have so far avoided their worst fears, a sign of how the damage from the shutdowns has varied widely across the retail landscape.
 Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette has said that his company’s reopened stores are regaining 50% of their typical business. Teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters is faring even better, averaging roughly 95% of its normal sales levels.

Jesus doesn't buy the logic of contamination and disgust. In example after example, not only does Jesus heal, through touch, but he makes the unclean clean. People are forgiven, healed, and returned to their communities, as good as new. Instead of following the natural impulses of disgust, avoiding, shunning, or even shaming, Jesus loves his neighbors by an act of radical hospitality. He moves toward those labeled unclean. Of course, ritual uncleanness and viral contagion are not the same thing, but we can still learn how to overcome disgust from Jesus' example. The danger of a disease like COVID-19 is that the disgust will not remain in the realm of the biological but will promiscuously become attached to people, leading to avoidance, othering, and losing the benefit of touch, proximity, and church together.

May your hearts soon be filled with wonderful memories of joyful times together as you celebrate a life well lived. I only knew Michael for about 8 months, but in that time I learned that Michael had a passion for the Arts.   Before I started working at printing partners , my friend Mindy would talk about the plays and how Michael loved them. Mindy would invite us to the plays and We would run into Michael there. I never had an interest or even seen a play or ballet in my life until recently. I now love going to plays and musicals and I can see why Michael had such appreciation for the theater. I will always think of Micheal now when I go to the theater. I though Michael was going to pull through and beat his cancer. Then the other day my friend said he did not have very long, I was shocked and so sad. Its so sad to hear that he passed so soon. My memories of Michael, what I love about him, when he came into work he would always smile and nod or say good morning! When he left at the end of the day he would say goodnight.   Praying for his family and friends.

Nissan says the new Rogue, which goes on sale this fall as a 2021 model, will offer more standard safety technology than any other similarly priced vehicle, including 10 airbags and rear automatic braking. It also will offer a high-end Platinum version with extras such as leather seats, a 12.3-inch dashboard screen and heated rear seats.
 To spur sales, the company has dropped a marketing campaign in the U.S. highlighting technology for its own sake, according to people familiar with the matter. Internally dubbed the “blue dots" program for ads that used electric blue-hued digital graphics to illustrate blind-spot detection and other features, the people said it’s been replaced by a marketing push highlighting more relatable driving scenarios without futuristic special effects.
 “While the mid-size crossover segment has broader appeal, the largest group of targeted customers is young families," Nissan’s COO Gupta said. “We designed the new versatile Rogue to make their lives comfortable."
 Dealers have high expectations for the Rogue, one of several launches expected this year including a Frontier mid-size truck and three-row Pathfinder SUV. It follows a slow start for the new Sentra compact sedan, which went on sale in late February just before the virus outbreak shut many showrooms.
 “Sentra was the first out of the box but got derailed by Covid," said Scott Smith, the chair of Nissan’s national dealer advisory board and an owner of Atlanta-area dealerships, who drove a prototype of the new Rogue during a visit to Japan. “It’s very competitive and I think they’ve got a home run."

Researchers in England say they have the first evidence that a drug can improve COVID-19 survival: A cheap, widely available steroid called dexamethasone reduced deaths by up to one third in severely ill hospitalized patients.
 Results were announced Tuesday and researchers said they would publish them soon. The study is a large, strict test that randomly assigned 2,104 patients to get the drug and compared them with 4,321 patients getting only usual care.
 The drug was given either orally or through an IV. After 28 days, it had reduced deaths by 35% in patients who needed treatment with breathing machines and by 20% in those only needing supplemental oxygen. It did not appear to help less ill patients.
 “This is an extremely welcome result,” one study leader, Peter Horby of the University of Oxford, said in a statement. "The survival benefit is clear and large in those patients who are sick enough to require oxygen treatment, so dexamethasone should now become standard of care in these patients. Dexamethasone is inexpensive, on the shelf, and can be used immediately to save lives worldwide.”
 Even though the drug only helps in severe cases, “countless lives will be saved globally,” said Nick Cammack of Wellcome, a British charity that supports science research.
 “Dexamethasone must now be rolled out and accessed by thousands of critically ill patients around the world," said Cammack, who had no role in the study. "It is highly affordable, easy to make, can be scaled up quickly and only needs a small dosage."
 Steroid drugs reduce inflammation, which sometimes develops in COVID-19 patients as the immune system overreacts to fight the infection. This overreaction can prove fatal, so doctors have been testing steroids and other anti-inflammatory drugs in such patients. The World Health Organization advises against using steroids earlier in the course of illness because they can slow the time until patients clear the virus.

Hundreds of thousands of seafarers looking to get off ships after sailing on extended contracts are faced with a ticklish situation: to stop sailing and get repatriated home with the help of the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), and incur the wrath of the ship owners and managers who employ them.
 It’s a Hobson’s Choice for seafarers, who have been running ships without a break, after the pandemic induced travel restrictions made crew changes impossible, drawing the attention of the globe on a workforce that has remained largely hidden from limelight despite being responsible for moving some 90 per cent of the world trade.
 When the June 15 deadline set by the ITF to repatriate crew working beyond their stipulated contract time, by following the protocols circulated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) ended on Monday, the onus of pulling the plug on world trade fell squarely on the shoulders of the overworked crew, notwithstanding the fact that these tired staff posed a risk to the safe operation of ships.
 “Enough is enough; you have the right to return home,” the London-based ITF advised seafarers anxiously waiting for a strong stand from the union.
 “If you have finished your contract, then you have the right to be repatriated. If this is not possible then you would remain on board as a passenger. The consequences could be that the ship is unable to sail if the manning level is inadequate, but that is not the responsibility of the seafarers,” ITF said.
 “We are clear – if a seafarer wants off a ship, then the ITF, our affiliate unions and the ITF inspectorate will do everything we can to assist them. We know that you need to get off these ships, and we will help you to do so where we can. You have done your job, performed your duties, and accepted that you were unable to return home in the beginning in order to contain the spread of Covid-19 – but no more,” it said.
 While a few thousand seafarers have been rotated globally since May, this is seen as a drop in the ocean, with the numbers awaiting replacement estimated to be about 150,000.
 Crew recruitment companies in India – a top supplier of crew to the global shipping industry - have “appealed” to the seafarers on board ships to “support” those on shore to join ships, nudging the crew to heed the advice of the ITF.
 “Indian recruitment companies have chartered flights and crew change is happening. Action by on-board seafarers will either make us (India crew) the darling of ship owners or will destroy jobs,” said Captain Sanjay Prashar, managing director at Mumbai-based V R Maritime Services.
 The issue is how do they get off the ships as ship owners and managers are reluctant to replace crew citing lack of international flights and to save on “unnecessary expenses on crew change”. While some big owners/managers have arranged charter flights to swap crew, smaller firms are waiting for commercial flights to re-start.
 Besides, ship owners and managers have said they will not support stoppage of work by the crew overdue for relief as this was not a solution to the crew change crisis.
 The problem is not the shipping companies, most of whom have shown an intent to get things moving, but governments who have sabotaged their plans, said a crewing executive.
 “Ship managers will be in trouble if the crew stops working. Each ship has a minimum manning number. If that is breached, the ship is considered unseaworthy and cannot sail. It will have to call at the nearest port to relieve the existing crew and get replacements to comply with the safe manning rules, depending on what that country will allow,” said a Chief Officer sailing on board a ship on extended contract.
 If crew change is possible in that port and the seafarer contacts the ITF to assist him in this, the owner/manager will have to carry out crew change even if it means the ship has to stay in port to clear quarantine and other requirements for crew change in that country.
 But, seafarers opting to get off the ship, have to be ready to be “harassed” by their employers when looking for their next assignment, he said.
 ITF should at least say that it will stand by the crew if any reciprocal action is taken by the manning companies, he said.
 “Looks like this suffering is here to stay,” he stated.

“The value of ‘Let It Fall’ was understanding how we got to those tipping points, and talking to people who lived through it,” said Ridley, who recently called in a Times op-ed for the removal of “Gone With the Wind” from HBO Max, saying that it romanticizes the horrors of slavery. (The film has since been pulled from the streaming service, with plans to return it eventually with additional materials providing more historical context.)
 He added, “Yes, there’s been progress, but at what cost? And how many people are paying that cost with their lives and we don’t know about it because there wasn’t video? Unfortunately the one throughline in all of this is that video matters.”
 Tying his film to current headlines, Ridley said, “The biggest difference is the massive display of empathy from white Americans and the whole world at large. That doesn’t mean a month from now, a year from now, that racial incidents are going away. But you see the pace of change every day, whether it’s monuments coming down, the NFL saying it should have handled the kneeling-during-the-national anthem issue better or NASCAR removing Confederate flags. It starts to make a difference.”
 Jenkins also noted the participation of whites in the current protest, which was not as prominent in the Los Angeles riots: “There have been plenty of white people who have reached out to me to apologize.”

Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said last week that he received a call from another team about Kaepernick. Carroll and the Seahawks brought in Kaepernick for a workout in 2017 and had another planned in 2018 before it was cancelled.
 Goodell set up a tryout for Kaepernick in Atlanta last year for scouts of all 32 teams to attend, but it unraveled at the last moment due to lack of media access and what Kaepernick's representatives saw as an unusual liability waiver. Instead of the workout taking place at the Falcons' training complex, Kaepernick conducted an impromptu session at a high school in front of media and scouts from eight teams.
 The NFL released a video on June 5 where Goodell apologized for the league for not doing a good job of listening to concerns by players on racial inequality. Goodell though was roundly criticized for the apology not mentioning Kaepernick.
 The video came out a day after many players released a video criticizing the league for not condemning racism following the May 25 death of George Floyd.
 “We had spent time prior to that understanding all the frustration, fear and sadness. When the video came out on Thursday it was very powerful. It was appropriate for me to respond,” Goodell said. “We should have listened to our players earlier including Colin Kaepernick, Eric Reid, Kenny Stills, Michael Jenkins and so many people really brought these issues to light.”
 Atanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan said Goodell’s video was a great step in the right direction.
 “We all need to be on the same page and address some of the uncomfortable things that need to be addressed,” he said.
 Goodell did not answer how the league would respond if President Donald Trump continued to criticize them if players kneeled for the national anthem. Goodell also said that he wants to include Kaepernick’s voice on how the league should approach social issues.
