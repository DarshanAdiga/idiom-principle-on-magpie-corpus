The National Rifle Association has laid off dozens of employees, canceled its national convention and scuttled fundraising, membership and shooting events that normally would be key to rallying its base in an election year.
 The coronavirus pandemic has upended the gun-rights organization during what should be heady times for the group, in the middle of presidential election and with gun owners riled up over what they see as an effort by authorities to trample on their Second Amendment rights.
 The NRA, which boasts about 5 million members, in recent weeks laid off or furloughed dozens of employees, imposed a four-day workweek for some employees and cut salaries across the board, including for CEO Wayne LaPierre. The financial issues, combined with the cancellation of fundraisers and the national convention, which would have surely drawn a visit from President Donald Trump, have complicated its ability to influence the 2020 election.
 In a memo to staff, LaPierre said 20% salary cuts were across the board while some senior staffers "voluntarily" reduced their wages even more. He said the staffing reductions and other changes were intended to be temporary.
 "The cancellation of the annual meeting had a significant financial impact but, beyond that, the health crisis has caused us to postpone countless fundraising and membership events along with competitions, training seminars and other revenue streams -- those disruptions are the primary drivers of our decision-making process," said Andrew Arulanandam, spokesman for the NRA. "Like every other business and nonprofit, we are forced to make tough choices in this new economic environment."
 The coronavirus has exacerbated financial woes that were already serving as a drag on the NRA as it wages legal fights with regulators and its once-loyal marketing firm and faces anger from rank-and-file members over stewardship of the gun group. It's also facing rising public frustration over gun laws in the wake of mass shootings.
 "Everybody's in the same boat as the NRA. The NRA's real problem is they had real existing financial problems before this happened," said Robert J. Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and a longtime watcher of the NRA. "It simply does not bode well for their impact on the upcoming election."
 The cutbacks have coincided with the NRA finding a new platform for its message during the pandemic.
 With the world panicked over the coronavirus, Americans bought record numbers of guns in March, based on background check data that is the best barometer of firearms sales in the U.S.
 The NRA and other gun-rights groups have been aggressively filing lawsuits challenging authorities in places across the U.S. that have declared gun shops and ranges as not being "essential" businesses and therefore allowed to remain open during stay-at-home directives. Gun owners have been flocking to state capitols to protest the restrictions, most prominently in Michigan.
 The immediate hope is that such legal challenges will persuade authorities to back down. But the NRA is also hoping the legal fights over "essential" activity will strengthen their hand in the courts and make it harder to restrict gun rights in the future.
 All of this comes against a backdrop of a rough couple of years, with legal fights, public and corporate backlash over guns and criticism of LaPierre's salary, leadership and extravagant spending habits.
 LaPierre earned about $2 million in compensation, according to the group's most-recent tax filings. The NRA would not say how much of a pay cut he's taking.
 "Defending freedom has never been easy. Over the years, we've weathered more tough times than most," LaPierre said in an email to NRA employees, obtained by The Associated Press. "But we will rise from this stronger and well positioned to lead the fight to protect our Second Amendment, the First Amendment, and all our constitutional freedoms during the crucial upcoming elections and for years to come."
 The 2018 massacre at a high school in Parkland, Florida, led to a groundswell of opposition to the NRA, driven by student-led protests over gun violence. Corporate America began pushing back, with some major retailers stopping gun sales and banks dropping discounts or certain services for NRA members and gunmakers.
 Just this week, the CEO of Wells Fargo, a bank known for its past willingness to be the go-to bank for the firearms industry, said its relationship with the NRA was "declining."
 The NRA also faces regulatory pressures in New York, where the group's charter was created in New York. The state attorney general there has launched legal actions along with her counterpart in Washington, D.C., that threaten the NRA's nonprofit status.
 After spending $30 million in 2016 toward efforts to elect Trump, the NRA saw its political influence wane in 2018 when it got outspent by several gun- control groups.
 Save the Second, a group of NRA members seeking changes to the organization, called the recent cutbacks the result of poor choices for years not the coronavirus.
 In a recent email to its followers, the group disputed putting blame on the pandemic: "Mr. LaPierre, if your organization was squeaky clean and ethically ran, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place."
 Gun-control groups are mobilizing to influence the 2020 election and contend the NRA's financial troubles will leave it incapable of playing a significant role in Trump's campaign.
 "I would be shocked if the NRA were able to sustain the investment in support of Trump in 2020 that it made in 2016," said Peter Ambler, executive director of the Giffords group, named after former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who was seriously wounded after being shot in 2011.
 Spitzer said the NRA's base -- many of whom are Trump supporters -- are still active and still loyal. "That hasn't really changed," he said.
 But the money challenges are likely to mean a more-muted voice.
 "You need to have an open checkbook to have a seat at the table," he said.

Klain responded, “Well Congressman, I think you do get it. I think your analysis is exactly right. If we want as a country, the people who make masks, who make the face shields, who make the other type of protective gear to make more of them, they have to know that we’re going to buy a large supply for a long time. And I think what they’re fearful of is that there will be changes in purchasing patterns. And the problem is the lack of federal leadership. Here’s why: if you’re there running one of these factories and the policy of the United States is that each state should order for itself, each hospital should order for itself, each pizza parlor should order masks for its pizza makers themselves—that’s our policy. So orders trickle in and come in from different places, you just don’t know how many orders there are going to be and how long they’re going to be there, or if things are going to change. So you see this reluctance of manufacturers to make the kinds of commitments you’re talking about. I think you’re spot on on this.”

The only certainty is uncertainty as it relates to enrollment for colleges and universities.
   
 That is included in a summary statement of a poll of 1,107 high school seniors conducted by the Art & Science Group. In it, 12 percent of students who had made a deposit at a college or university said they've changed their plans and won't enroll. Another 40 percent hadn't made a deposit.
   
 Fifty-two percent said a parent had been laid off or furloughed.
   
 It's in this environment that universities and colleges are navigating as they prepare for fall semester enrollment.
   
 UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI
   
 At MU, the state's largest single campus, 5,329 prospective students had paid deposits by last week. That's down slightly from the 5,460 deposits by May 1 last year, which at that time foreshadowed a strong freshman enrollment.
   
 And in August, for the first time since 2015, enrollment grew at MU. Not by much, but at 30,014 it signaled the end of a 16 percent slide following campus protests over racial issues that sent enrollment to its lowest levels in 10 years.
   
 Fall semester enrollment has been declining for the past five years for almost all higher education institutions. The five-year decline for public institutions is nearly 11 percent. It has declined 15 percent at MU in that period.
   
 Kim Humphrey, MU vice provost for enrollment management, said the relatively flat deposit numbers could change before classes resume on campus in August. While there are many unknowns, her team is working to ensure the enrollment numbers are positive.
   
 "We're going to be open," Humphrey said. "We want students to come back."
   
 The university has pivoted quickly to make online courses work while campus was closed, but it's not good enough. In-person classes were suspended on March 11.
   
 "They want more," Humphrey said of students. "They want the total experience with sports and the Greek life experience."
   
 The inability of prospective students to tour the campus probably won't be a detriment, because all other campuses also are closed, she said.
   
 "We were lucky that we've had a virtual tour online up and running for several years," Humphrey said. "We've tried to replicate recruitment as much as we can while doing all that online. We have online student panel presentations, where prospective students can talk to our students. We're trying to make it the same experience. We're putting our best foot forward."
   
 Summer Welcome is another activity that will be virtual, she said.
   
 "We've got pretty good responses," Humphrey said of Summer Welcome.
   
 Since tuition rates won't be set until June, Humphrey said she didn't want to speculate how they might affect fall enrollment.
   
 Last May, the University of Missouri System Board of Curators approved a 5 percent tuition increase for the current academic year.
   
 MU is under severe financial strain, with layoffs and a 12 percent cut to academic operations. UM System President and Interim Chancellor Mun Choi and other top officials have taken a 10 percent salary cut for three months. Mandatory pay cuts and furloughs in the MU Medical School were announced Thursday and on Friday, 32 jobs were cut at MU Health Care and 17 elsewhere at MU.
   
 Choi said during a virtual town hall that tuition revenues and state revenues are the two most substantial revenue sources for the university.
   
 "We won't place the burden on the backs of students and parents," Choi said about tuition.
   
 The UM System is receiving $34 million from the federal CARES ACT, with $17 million going to students in need. That will assist in retaining current students, because it only applies to current students affected by the pandemic, Humphrey said.
   
 Prospective students are working with people in the financial aid office to make adjustments to student applications to take into account sudden changes in the economic circumstances of families.
   
 "We've got a special team in the financial aid office created to do just that," Humphrey said.
   
 There hasn't been much indication that more high school seniors are planning to take a gap year between high school and college, she said.
   
 Former Chancellor Alexander Cartwright, before he left MU and before the pandemic closed the campus, spoke with the Tribune about enrollment prospects.
   
 "I don't envision us over the next few years growing that substantially," Cartwright said. MU must have the infrastructure, including faculty, buildings and resources, to support enrollment, he said.
   
 Steps taken to fill residence halls had successfully packed campus housing, to the point where MU signed a deal with The Rise apartment building to house students this fall.
   
 More students are going to community colleges now before enrolling in a four- year institution, said Cartwright.
   
 STUDENT VIEWS
   
 Art & Science Group conducted back-to-back polls of graduating seniors about their college plans in March and April, using different students each month
   
 Thirty-five percent of students in the March poll said they would take a gap year, but that had declined to 16 percent in the April poll.
   
 Twenty-one percent said their first choice school may not be affordable for their families in March. That had increased to 27 percent in April.
   
 "This is a shock to the system," said Rick Hesel, a principal with Art & Science Group. "It's going to have a profound impact on higher education."
   
 He spoke between the release of the two polls.
   
 He can't predict if the enrollment outlook for universities and colleges would improve or worsen, he said.
   
 "I think for institutions, their planning should include all possible options," Hesel said. "If they don't, they will get caught with their pants down."
   
 Students don't want to pay full price for online courses, Hesel said.
   
 In the March poll, 60 percent of the students surveyed said a parent had been laid off or furloughed.
   
 "I think this is so unpredictable," he said.
   
 In another measure, the American Council on Education, an association of university presidents, predicted around a 15 percent decline in enrollment.
   
 The enrollment outlook for community colleges is similarly murky.
   
 Jeff Lashley, president of Moberly Area Community College, declined to provide any preliminary enrollment numbers, saying he didn't trust them. Fall semester enrollment at Moberly Area Community College has declined 11 percent over five years.
   
 "A lot of students are sitting and waiting," Lashley said. "There's so much ambiguity, they don't know."
   
 MACC advisers are working from home, enrolling students and conducting virtual advising session.
   
 "Our advisers are very busy, which is encouraging," he said.
   
 Its campuses are closed and the summer session will be online. The fall semester may be a mixture of online and in-seat courses.
   
 MACC will deal with however enrollment turns out, he said.
   
 "This is a first for all of us," Lashley said. "We're doing our best to prepare for any eventuality."

SAUGATUCK -- With the Kalamazoo River spilling over into the streets of Saugatuck again this week, business owners and residents in Saugatuck are worried about what a serious storm surge would do to their properties.
   
 Rains Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday caused flooding at the river's edge, which closed down the intersection of Lucy and Water streets. Floodwaters covered the west end of Spear Street and the south end of Butler Street and threatened businesses on the river's edge, like The River Market on Water Street.
   
 Owner Jim Bieke told The Sentinel a line of sandbags around his building kept his business dry this time, but he wasn't so lucky last fall.
   
 "The same thing happened over the Thanksgiving holiday and my store was completely flooded," Bieke said. "I had 17 inches of water in the back and about 5 inches out in front."
   
 That flood, the day before Thanksgiving, took out many of the store's appliances, including the furnace.
   
 "Another flood would be devastating," chef and restaurant owner Eric Chaitan told Saugatuck City Council on Thursday.
   
 Chaitan said the Thanksgiving flood's damage to his riverside businesses was extensive and costly, and he's spent tens of thousands on preventative measures since.
   
 "If that happens again, we'll certainly be closed for this season and, candidly, I don't know that we'll recover from it," Chaitan told the council.
   
 In a meeting Monday, the Saugatuck City Council prioritized taking action at the intersection of Lucy and Water streets, which has seen persistent flooding problems. Several businesses and homes are located at the intersection.
   
 "This is the most difficult situation we have right now," Council member Barry Johnson said.
   
 The council voted to use a Hesco flood barrier, a container made up of heavy duty fabric and collapsible mesh wire filled with sand, and install a pumping system at the flooding site. The cost is expected to be between $11,000 and $13,000.
   
 At another special meeting Thursday to discuss the flooding, the city council voted to prioritize taking action at:
       The end of Spear Street   The south end of Butler Street   The Wicks Park restroom     
 The council also voted to purchase a quick-fill sandbag machine, expected to cost about $4,600.
   
 The city asked consultant Edgewater Resources to look at flooding sites in the city and develop a range of mitigation strategies for each. The strategies range from several thousands of dollars for Hesco barrier and pump solutions to the hundreds of thousands for stormwater lift stations.
   
 Saugatuck only has $20,000 earmarked this year for flood mitigation, but the council expects to overspend that budget to tackle these projects in preparation for more flooding throughout the season.
   
 "I think we all know $20,000 isn't going to hack it," said Council member Mark Bekken.
   
 Saugatuck City Manager Kirk Harrier said the city may be able to use road millage funds for street flooding issues.
   
 Council member Holly Leo wondered aloud how bad the flooding could be if Saugatuck were to see a major storm surge.
   
 "The weather we've experienced the last 48 hours is a fairly minor event. We didn't really have the wind and we don't have the water heights that we're going to have in a month or two, so I just think we really have to keep that in mind," she said.
   
 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has predicted record-high water levels on Lake Michigan this spring and summer.
   
 "It's really hard to know what to expect moving forward," said Scott Herbert, Saugatuck's Department of Public Works director, who surveyed the flooded areas this week. "Back by Thanksgiving we had a storm surge of a foot and a half, two foot. If that happened now, that would be devastating."
   
 "We're not going to be able to stop these events from happening, but we can reduce the impact that these events do have when they occur," Herbert said.
   
 Chaitan pushed the council to consider investing even more in flooding prevention.
   
 "I urge you all to look at sort of the ROI (return on investment) to the town on the investment versus what the loss would be with those businesses gone," Chaitan said.

The coronavirus crisis has exposed the financial vulnerabilities of countless Iowa businesses.
   
 Whether we like it or not, it will be touch-and-go to see how many come through this intact, how many will end up as shadows of their former selves, and how many will disappear.
   
 It's implausible that businesses will pick right up where they left off two months ago and proceed as if this were just an extended power outage.
   
 That's why our state needs to have its leaders -- Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals, middle-of-the-roaders, big-city folks, small-town and rural residents -- sit down for in-depth, comprehensive discussions about the way state government uses its economic assistance to help businesses.
   
 I've been chewing on this, not just because of the "Closed Because of the Pandemic" signs in store windows and on businesses' websites. For several years, I have been concerned that state government puts too much of its business incentive money into the largest cities and too little into the county seat communities that are sprinkled across the Iowa countryside.
   
 This has been on my mind lately because of a decision earlier this month by the Iowa Economic Development Authority that did not get much attention at the time. People were focused, instead, on the life-and-death battle of the coronavirus epidemic that was playing out in nursing homes, meatpacking plants and factories across our state.
   
 On April 17, the economic development agency awarded $710,000 in state tax credits to Iowa Bankers Insurance and Services Inc., a for-profit affiliate of the Iowa Bankers Association. The state assistance is tied to the bankers groups' plans for a new office building in Urbandale to house their operations.
   
 When the building is completed next year, the business association, its insurance company and a wholly owned mortgage subsidiary will move out of an office building in Johnston, where they now rent space.
   
 Let me repeat that so there is no confusion:
   
 Iowa state government agreed to provide the Iowa Bankers Association and its for-profit affiliate with $710,000 in state tax credits in return for the association moving its offices from Johnston four stoplights away to Urbandale.
   
 The association and its affiliated companies now have 196 employees. In exchange for the state tax assistance, the association agreed to add 18 jobs.
   
 However, in a separate agreement with the City of Urbandale, the association agreed to employ at least 195 people -- that's down one from the current level -- for the next 10 years. During those 10 years, the city will provide about $1.6 million in property tax rebates to the bankers.
   
 Eighteen new jobs certainly is a positive development for our state, especially with the economic uncertainties brought by the coronavirus.
   
 But businesses all across Iowa regularly create jobs, and they have received not a nickel's worth of state economic assistance in return.
   
 These owners have opened new businesses or expanded their existing operations. Some have constructed new buildings or remodeled older ones. These business owners have maintained their employment numbers or added jobs -- all without a nickel's worth of state assistance like the bankers association received.
   
 These entrepreneurs have opened hardware stores and machinery repair businesses. Some have plunged into establishing Main Street restaurants. Walk the commercial areas of Iowa's county seat communities and you will find computer repair and website development businesses. You will see sophisticated marketing firms.
   
 All of these provide jobs that add to the economy of rural Iowa as surely as the Iowa Bankers Association office building will add to the vibrancy of the office park in Urbandale. That new hardware store at the edge of town, or a community bank's new building, or the financial adviser's tidy new quarters each adds in a positive way to our smaller communities.
   
 I have long thought that Iowa's economic incentive money is skewed too often to helping growing communities continue to grow, rather than helping other communities have more of a fighting chance.
   
 This is unfortunate, because the complexion of Iowa will continue to change in ways that do not bode well for our future if state government does not provide a helping hand in rural Iowa, too, as well as urban areas.
   
 If the Iowa Bankers Association wants to own its office building, rather than renting space, that's a fine decision.
   
 But $710,000 in state assistance to move four stoplights down the road?

Stephanie Gooden is past the point of wondering if rural broadband is a necessity.
   
 "It's far past time and we need to get going," the northern district commissioner of Saline County said.
   
 The primary hurdle that keeps rural areas from attaining access to reliable internet, however, isn't recognition of the need. There are 780,000 people without access to internet speeds of 25 megabits for second, the federal minimum, in their home.
   
 The primary hurdle is money.

 But before the coronavirus shuttered industries and forced schools to close their doors, before Gooden had to figure out how to keep county staff online as they adjusted to working from home, she knew her county needed faster internet.
   
 "It just seems like a hurdle that we shouldn't have to tackle in this century," she said. "We're too far advanced for this. We have the technology. We just need the communities to be funded so we can get it out to everyone."
   
 There are several financing options for private firms and co-ops interested in providing internet in rural areas.
   
 A cooperative can poll members and see if they are willing to take on the costs like Co-Mo Connect Electric Co-op did in 2011 when it built out in Moniteau County.
   
 The United States Department of Agriculture has funds. Gooden and Marshall Municipal Utilities did just that and won a partial grant, partial loan in late January.
   
 There are also state programs like the Missouri Broadband Grant Program, which awarded $3.05 million to rural providers on April 17.
   
 Gascosage Electric Cooperative in Phelps County received $405,332 to help fund a $1.09 million project in Phelps County.
   
 But there's a catch - and it can frustrate projects that would otherwise move ahead. Poviders can't use a state grant in addition to a federal grant in the same project area. So some providers are passing on some opportunities in favor of other, potentially more lucrative, options down the road.
   
 Semo Electric Cooperative in Sikeston won a state grant in the most recent round of funding. But General Manager Sean Vanslyke turned it down because accepting it would disqualify him from applying for possibly more money from the Federal Communications Commission in October to bring internet to the same area.
   
 "It would be outstanding if we could stack or match the grants so that we could leverage the state and federal dollars together in order not to double dip, but to better serve the citizens in our areas," Vanslyke said.
   
 Vanslyke wonders if there is a better way - if the process could become more efficient if the state offered matching dollars or made it possible to use a state grant in addition to a federal grant.
   
 GRANTING CONNECTION
   
 The Missouri Broadband Grant Program was created in 2018 and allocated $5 million in 2019. The money was to be distributed for projects serving un- or under-served areas, which are defined as those that don't have access to internet speeds of at least 25 megabits per second (mbps). But the funds shouldn't overlap with other projects happening in the same area.
   
 "The purpose for that is to ensure other broadband programs, which are obviously expanding and doing great things … are not coupled together," Broadband Development Director Tim Arbeiter said. "In essence, with the state grant, it's intended to go farther."
   
 Missouri's program is intended to work like a puzzle, fitting into an existing grant project until all of Missouri has access to at least one form of internet service. The metric for success is area covered.
   
 That's how it's working for Gascosage Cooperative General Manager Carmen Hartwell. Her cooperative just started pursuing broadband projects.
   
 "It's not just to get somewhat better internet speeds. The idea is to get it to people who have nothing," Hartwell said. "That's what our approach has been right now."
   
 Gascosage's upcoming project in Phelps County involves laying 21 miles of fiber internet that will serve 83 homes. That comes out to between $48,000 and $50,000 per fiber mile.
   
 "It's not a profitable thing," Hartwell said. "Which is exactly how rural electric cooperatives were built, because no one wanted to build out rural electric infrastructure because the density was so low."
   
 Electric co-ops are in the perfect position to build out internet. Cooperatives are member-owned, not-for-profit organizations, meaning they aren't trying to make money on rural broadband projects. But small margins mean little money for big investments like rural fiber.
   
 "I hate to say that it's a responsibility of the government, but I think it's past that," Gooden said. "It just needs to be done. We need the funding."
   
 Gooden and Marshall Municipal Utilities just won a grant through the USDA Reconnect One program. They've already applied for the second round of funding, Reconnect Two. During the application process for one of the grants, Gooden said they had to carve out a portion of the project because a satellite internet provider had already applied for a grant for the same area.
   
 "They are using fixed wireless," Gooden said. "I know fixed wireless has a need … but it's not always consistent. Fiber is a direct connection. So why is a direct connect company competing with a fixed wireless company?"
   
 Vanslyke is running into similar issues while trying to build out a six-county area of the Bootheel. He said that the ability to stack grants either to cover more costs of a single project or to offer more than one service to a particular area could help rural co-ops as they try to sort through the web of funding opportunities.
   
 DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR
   
 In some ways Pennsylvania's rural broadband program is behind Missouri's. It's still an initiative underneath the Office of Economic and Community Development, meaning it doesn't receive direct appropriations from the state's budget.
   
 In other ways, however, it's exactly what Vanslyke would like to see in Missouri.
   
 Many federal grant programs require a local match either with the provider's own funds or through a local government or organization.
   
 "But a lot of these smaller providers can't necessarily come up with a match on their own," Sheri Collins said.
   
 Collins is leading the governor's broadband initiative, Restore Pennsylvania, from within the state's Department for Economic and Community Development.
   
 She spent much of the last year traveling around the state meeting with rural providers and communities still waiting to receive broadband capabilities.
   
 "Any time you can leverage state, local and federal funds together, you have an opportunity of really being able to make a larger impact," Collins said.
   
 Because Pennsylvania's program has yet to be codified into legislation, many of its funding opportunities are one-off matching funds.
   
 Although Missouri's program is more consistent, providers like Vanslyke say the ability to match or stack grants and loans would not only cut some of the complicated bureaucracy out of applying for funds, but also help keep their projects viable.
   
 "The more dollars that we have from those funding sources the more people that we can help," Vanslyke said.
   
 There is no talk of changing the way the Missouri Broadband Grant Program operates among state leaders. Because it was created in the legislature, any change would need to originate in the state's house of representatives.
   
 Although rural providers do wish the program was more flexible, they don't want to sound ungrateful for the funds. Rural broadband is expensive, especially fiber projects like Hartwell's, Vanslyke's and Gooden's. It basically requires utility companies to take miles of hair-thin glass and either bury it underground or string it from utility poles.
   
 Yet, the past two months have made clear that without consistent and competitive broadband offerings, rural communities will get left behind amid a rapidly transitioning economy.
   
 What providers and local leaders are grappling with is how to do it and, sometimes, betting on the opportunity that will get them the most dollars for their efforts.

Are you a fresh tomato lover? Do you enjoy eating a vine ripe, juicy tomato that is full of flavor? Well, I do and I guess I am a little bit of a tomato snob. I love a vine-ripe, heirloom tomato that might be a funny shape or even a funny color, ones that are mouthwatering good. When I find one that is really tasty, I am known to devour the entire tomato myself.      Growing tomatoes is often the motivation for starting a vegetable garden, and every tomato lover dreams of growing the ultimate tomato. To learn more about growing tomatoes, I decided to ask a neighbor, Rusty Edmonds, who grows more than 50 tomato plants each year.      Rusty said one of his tricks is to choose the best varieties, start the plants off right and control problems before they happen. He grows hybrid ones and heirloom ones. He explained to me some of the differences. I learned a great deal about the different types of tomatoes and some of the dos and don'ts that will be helpful for beginner gardeners.      There are two main kinds of tomatoes, hybrids (determinate) and heirloom (indeterminate). Hybrid tomatoes are called determinate because they have a predetermined number of stems, leaves and size. They tend to be a bush tomato that produces a crop and then they die. Commercial growers like to grow these because they require no pruning; they ripen over a shorter time.      An heirloom tomato is a vine tomato. These tomatoes will continue growing and producing tomatoes until the plant is killed by frost if they are kept healthy. These require more staking than the bush or hybrid tomatoes.      Hybrids are grown for their uniform size, shape, durability to transport, ability to pick before ripe and for their production. Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over heirloom plants. Hybrid tomatoes usually out produce heirloom tomatoes but if you save the seeds from a hybrid, you will get a different tomato.      Heirloom means it has been grown for more than 50 years and is consistently grown from the collected seed. Heirloom varieties were all that existed until hybrids were created in the 20th century. Heirloom tomatoes are around today because seeds were saved and passed down from generation to generation. You also can save the seed each year to grow more, as long as the tomatoes were not cross-pollinated with hybrid tomatoes.      The requirements for growing either type of tomato are the same. Start by choosing a good, healthy plant. Rusty mixes some Epsom salt in the hole when he plants along with a little cow manure but he says if you put too much manure, you will get a great big plant but no tomatoes; so just a little manure. Rusty says that to get good quality fruit, tomatoes need an ample supply of potassium (potash), which can be supplied with fertilizer or organic matter. Rusty says that some people put a little wood ash around the plants to get the potash needed but he does not because if you put too much, it will alter the pH or acidity of the soil. Tomatoes like a slightly acidic soil, 6.0 to 6.5. and 7 is natural.      He adds lime to the entire garden and turns it in. He fertilizes about every two weeks with Miracle-Gro for tomatoes. (People who plant in sandy soil will need to feed more often since the fertilizer leaches out quicker, and less often in heavy clay soil.) Do not over-fertilize at first. You can come back and give them more every three weeks. You do not want to burn the plants.      Water regularly, especially when you first plant. You can get blossom rot if the plants do not get water regularly, especially at first. It is hard to be specific on the amount of water. If the plants dry out completely, it is hard to play catch up. If you have a hot dry spell like we often have had during June, you will need to water more often.      It is not mandatory but you can remove the bottom leaves of the plants. This will help you have better air circulation and these lower leaves could become diseased. They are the first to turn yellow.      You know your tomatoes are ripe when they turn a uniform color, red, yellow or pink, depending on the variety you have planted. This uniform color is what you have worked hard to get.      Try a few plants of both hybrid and heirloom tomatoes. This way, you will have early tomatoes that are prolific followed by a continuous crop of heirloom tomatoes until frost comes along.      And as you are enjoying your tomatoes, you'll know you are getting lots of Vitamins A and C, and eating something naturally low in calories and high in lycopene, an antioxidant.      Rusty plants several different varieties of tomatoes. Cherokee Purple, Celebrity, Brandywine and Beefstakes, the largest one. He also planted a smaller one called Tommy Toes, which is also an heirloom tomato. They are so tasty that even our grandchildren eat them. He grows Park's Whooper and Better Boys too that are hybrids.      Now think about planting some tomato plants to enjoy this summer. It is worth the effort and, remember, you can grow them in a pot on your patio as long as you get about eight hours of sun. You could even get hooked.

 The coronavirus crisis has exposed the financial vulnerabilities of countless Iowa businesses.
 Whether we like it or not, it will be touch-and-go to see how many come through this intact, how many will end up as shadows of their former selves, and how many will disappear.
 It's implausible that businesses will pick right up where they left off two months ago and proceed as if this were just an extended power outage.
 That's why our state needs to have its leaders -- Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, liberals, middle-of-the-roaders, big-city folks, small-town and rural residents -- sit down for in-depth, comprehensive discussions about the way state government uses its economic assistance to help businesses.
 I've been chewing on this, not just because of the \"Closed Because of the Pandemic\" signs in store windows and on businesses' websites. For several years, I have been concerned that state government puts too much of its business incentive money into the largest cities and too little into the county seat communities that are sprinkled across the Iowa countryside.
 This has been on my mind lately because of a decision earlier this month by the Iowa Economic Development Authority that did not get much attention at the time. People were focused, instead, on the life-and-death battle of the coronavirus epidemic that was playing out in nursing homes, meatpacking plants and factories across our state.
 On April 17, the economic development agency awarded $710,000 in state tax credits to Iowa Bankers Insurance and Services Inc., a for-profit affiliate of the Iowa Bankers Association. The state assistance is tied to the bankers groups' plans for a new office building in Urbandale to house their operations.
 When the building is completed next year, the business association, its insurance company and a wholly owned mortgage subsidiary will move out of an office building in Johnston, where they now rent space.
 Let me repeat that so there is no confusion:
 Iowa state government agreed to provide the Iowa Bankers Association and its for-profit affiliate with $710,000 in state tax credits in return for the association moving its offices from Johnston four stoplights away to Urbandale.
 The association and its affiliated companies now have 196 employees. In exchange for the state tax assistance, the association agreed to add 18 jobs.
 However, in a separate agreement with the City of Urbandale, the association agreed to employ at least 195 people -- that's down one from the current level -- for the next 10 years. During those 10 years, the city will provide about $1.6 million in property tax rebates to the bankers.
 Eighteen new jobs certainly is a positive development for our state, especially with the economic uncertainties brought by the coronavirus.
 But businesses all across Iowa regularly create jobs, and they have received not a nickel's worth of state economic assistance in return.
 These owners have opened new businesses or expanded their existing operations. Some have constructed new buildings or remodeled older ones. These business owners have maintained their employment numbers or added jobs -- all without a nickel's worth of state assistance like the bankers association received.
 These entrepreneurs have opened hardware stores and machinery repair businesses. Some have plunged into establishing Main Street restaurants. Walk the commercial areas of Iowa's county seat communities and you will find computer repair and website development businesses. You will see sophisticated marketing firms.
 All of these provide jobs that add to the economy of rural Iowa as surely as the Iowa Bankers Association office building will add to the vibrancy of the office park in Urbandale. That new hardware store at the edge of town, or a community bank's new building, or the financial adviser's tidy new quarters each adds in a positive way to our smaller communities.
 I have long thought that Iowa's economic incentive money is skewed too often to helping growing communities continue to grow, rather than helping other communities have more of a fighting chance.
 This is unfortunate, because the complexion of Iowa will continue to change in ways that do not bode well for our future if state government does not provide a helping hand in rural Iowa, too, as well as urban areas.
 If the Iowa Bankers Association wants to own its office building, rather than renting space, that's a fine decision.
 But $710,000 in state assistance to move four stoplights down the road?

"I think I write the way I do because of a vitamin deficiency. I don't eat any vegetables. I just eat meat and potatoes. I think I'm trying to make up in my songwriting what I lack in vitamins." - John Prine      If he didn't already know what a spring tonic is, John Prine was the kind of person who would have been disappointed to learn it isn't an alcoholic drink. But I bet he knew. With roots in western Kentucky, he was country to the bone.      A spring tonic is a mix of wild plant parts traditionally gathered at the end of winter in many rural parts of America. Back in the day, folk survived winter on a Prine-style diet of rations that had dwindled to the likes of flour, bacon, potatoes and sugar. After months indoors on a white, greasy diet, the first hunt of the year for green, vitamin-rich plants was an awakening for the mind, body and belly.      I don't know that Prine went foraging for wild plants in his spare time, but even if he didn't long for chlorophyll, he acknowledged vegetables as a path to salvation. His advice to "plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches, and try to find Jesus on your own" remains a three-line anthem to generations of back-to-the-landers.      Here in our first post-Prine spring we are largely stuck at home, or close to it, and there may not be a better time to forage the neighborhood for your own local spring tonic. I'm going to tell you how to serve it in the form of a gathered plant pesto. If you told him it was Weed Pesto, as I call it, the man with the twinkle in his songs might have used it.      Wild & edible   Every region will have its own list of edible, nutritious, ideally palatable spring greens. And there are some plants that are available nearly everywhere, like dandelion, lambsquarters, chickweed, purslane, dock, sorrel, cattails, nettles, watercress, asparagus and fiddlehead ferns. Even Johnny jump ups, also called violas, are edible, with a fresh, minty taste.      Each of these plants will have its own specifics for harvesting and cooking. Nettles, which have a fragrant, almost fishy taste, require scissors and a bag, and perhaps gloves, and should always be eaten cooked or blended unless you have the tongue of a bear. Dandelions, which are bitter as a good IPA beer, can be eaten raw or cooked; every single inch, from root to flower. Ditto for chickweed, which tastes a bit like parsley and licorice.      Many of the same principles for collecting wild plants also apply in your backyard. Every would-be forager must assess the grounds at their disposal and strategize accordingly.      The mentality involved in foraging is one to which any food shopper can relate. We go to the supermarket in search of one grocery item, but it's sold out and we have to improvise, and come home with another.      But the wild food we gather has not been vetted for edibility like grocery store food. Before you put anything in your mouth, find a trusted reference on the edible plants of your area. Search any piece of land that is legally available and clean of pesticides and other chemical and yellow animal fluids. Always do your harvesting away from any trail, and don't ever wipe out a location, so the patch can recover. And if you are lucky enough to have a backyard, explore every square inch.      How to enjoy   The easiest way to enjoy these plants might be in a saute pan, a handful of spring greens at a time, with salt, onions and olive oil. If you have a decent blender, this pesto recipe is thick with flavor, fat and chlorophyll. Toss it onto hot noodles. Scramble it into eggs or migas. Or just eat it off the spoon.      Pesto is one of the tastier ways to consume any green plant, especially those with strong flavors. It can incorporate essentially anything green, though some leaves, and combinations of leaves, will taste better than others. If not good enough, add more nuts, garlic, oil and cheese.      Our pesto will have a base of dandelion, since they are literally everywhere. In today's version I add nettles, as they are prolific right now where I live, and make a thick, aromatic pesto. But you could substitute any number of wild greens or weeds, like lambsquarter, watercress or chickweed, or a mixture of whatever you think will go well together. If these flavors are too strong, you could also substitute parsley or basil in place of some of the wild stuff.      Weed Pesto   8 servings   • 2 tablespoons chopped garlic   • 1 teaspoon salt   • 1 cup olive oil   • 1/2 cup almonds or pine nuts   • ½ cup grated parmesan or romano cheese   • Zest of a lemon, and 2 tablespoons of juice   • 4 cups chopped dandelion greens, loosely packed, spotlessly clean   • 5 three-inch nettle tips (or other greens)      Add the garlic, salt, oil, nuts, cheese, lemon juice and zest to the blender and turn them into a thin, homogenous solution. Carefully add the greens to the pesto, a few at a time, until they too are part of the smooth paste.   Serve tossed on piping hot noodles, which will cook the garlic just a tad. I like to stir in some sauteed greens, too.      Refrigerate the leftovers.

April was a cruel month.
   
 In Missouri, COVID-19 killed 315 people in 30 days.
   
 Nationwide, the death toll was 59,013.
   
 And worldwide, 190,855 deaths were recorded from coronavirus infections in April.
   
 That is almost 11 every day in the state, 2,000 every day nationwide and 6,400 per day worldwide.
   
 Now, Missouri is preparing to reopen. Gov. Mike Parson says we are ready, with a lower daily count of new cases, adequate hospital space and supplies and limits on how much gathering people can do.
   
 State Health Director Randall Williams says we are ready. There is expanded testing capacity with an ability to flood tests into an area to "box in" new outbreaks and send teams to do contact tracing.
   
 Most important, they said, Missouri is flattening the curve.
   
 That means that the spread of the coronavirus is slowing and while not over, the danger is less.
   
 HOW IT'S MEASURED
   
 The Tribune has tracked the daily increase in cases and deaths in Missouri, the nation and the world since the first case was reported in the state on March 7. Late last week, after providing epidemiologists with the data on the number of new cases every day for the month, the Tribune asked them to define flattening the curve and what data they considered most important to measure for that definition.
   
 The curve, meaning infections tracked on a graph, is bending. The number of new cases per day has been declining in the state and steady nationally, they said. That means that people who are infected are then spreading it to one other person or less.
   
 Christelle Ilboudo, an infectious disease specialist and assistant professor in the University of Missouri School of Medicine, said she looks at several models but advises that they are "not necessarily all very precise."
   
 For Ilboudo, a stable number of new cases over time is one measure and so is new hospitalizations. Those numbers have shown improvement, she said, but that's not enough to declare the pandemic ended.
   
 "Some of us were never exposed, and suddenly, when we all go out and about, we increase that risk of being exposed and getting sick," Ilboudo said. "The point is that it is not as fast that it is over."
   
 David McKinsey, an infectious disease specialist with HCA Midwest Health Research Medical Center in Kansas City, said he watches new cases reported, new hospitalizations and deaths from the disease.
   
 Hospitalizations are his key data point to determine where things stand.
   
 "With hospitalizations, we know that a certain percent will be ill enough to require hospitalization and the criteria are standardized," McKinsey said. "Looking at trends in hospitalizations provides the most meaningful information."
   
 And Elvin Geng, director of the Center for Dissemination and Implementation Science in the Institute for Public Health at Washington University, said he, too, looks at new hospitalizations as the most reliable figure.
   
 Hospitalizations in the St. Louis metro region, which has two-thirds of all known infections in Missouri, have stopped growing, but they have remained stubbornly resistant to a decline, Geng said. That shows a large number of new infections well into April, long after the regional stay-at-home order took effect on March 22.
   
 "Shelter in place is essentially our nuclear option," Geng said. "What this shows is our nuclear option wasn't that nuclear."
   
 Unfortunately, the data on hospitalizations in Missouri has not been as good as the state's tally of new cases. The Missouri Hospital Association compiles the data and changed both the format of its reports, and the definitions for some data, twice in April.
   
 There were 896 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the state on Saturday, including nine at University of Missouri Hospital in Columbia and two at Boone Hospital Center. That was 117 more than the week beginning on Sunday, but the number has been as low as 655 and as high as 891 previously during the week.
   
 The definition of how those cases are counted changed on April 25, so data from before that date is not comparable to current numbers.
   
 Another example of how the data being reported has changed involves ventilators. The number of mechanical ventilators available in the state has been part of it since the first report. But only in the past week have the reports shown how many COVID-19 patients are on ventilators. There were 137 on Friday.
   
 The state reported that 27.1 percent of ICU beds in the state were available Friday, the lowest share since reporting started. That definition has not changed.
   
 An increase in the number of cases reported, McKinsey said, could mean continuing spread or it could be related to the increasing availability of testing.
   
 Deaths, he said, are "a lagging indicator." That is because the number of deaths on any given day doesn't indicate when a person became infected.
   
 "It would definitely be encouraging to see a downward trend in deaths," McKinsey said. "In some cases this could be explained by improvements in medical care, but a declining death rate is correlated with an overall decline in disease."
   
 WHAT'S NEXT
   
 Any individual in Missouri who wants a COVID-19 test must show symptoms but for certain classes of individuals, including first responders and hospitalized patients, the test will be given even if there is no known contact with a case confirmed by testing.
   
 The state has also been doing mass testing and community surveillance testing. At the Triumph Foods plant in St. Joseph, where 259 cases were discovered, more of the 2,300 tests administered have to be processed. Many of those people had no symptoms.
   
 The tests have a limited utility in determining whether there is new spread of the disease because some patients will test positive well past the time they are contagious, Ilboudo said.
   
 "The question we haven't answered is, just because I find genetic material, is it capable of leaving my body and making somebody else sick?" Ilboudo said.
   
 The key to controlling an epidemic is to keep the ratio of new cases to existing cases below one, Geng said. Anything above one and sooner or later there will be disease spread that can overwhelm health systems as was seen first in Wuhan, then Italy and later New York.
   
 "We need to have our antenna up," he said. "One antenna is a very strong testing program. That depends on being able to detect those pockets and that means testing has to be incredibly widely available and immediately accessible."
   
 For the month of April, the average number of newly reported infections in Missouri was 208 per day, with the highest weekly average during the second week of April, at 248. But this past week, with 592 new infections reported Friday and Saturday, the weekly average rose to 266 per day after trending much lower.
   
 Part of it was a mass testing program in Buchanan County, but most of it was a continued high number of new cases in the St. Louis metro area.
   
 Tests tell only so much, Ilboudo noted. Some people have positive results for 30 or 40 days after they have recovered from the disease, she said.
   
 McKinsey, author of two articles on the 1918 flu pandemic, said the daily totals show the disease continues to spread. It is too early to relax social- distancing measures such as the stay-at-home order, he said.
   
 The flu in 1918 started at an Army camp in Kansas in the spring, subsided in the summer and came roaring back that fall, after infected soldiers took it to France. That epidemic was very responsive to social distancing measures and communities that ended them too early in the fall paid a price with a third wave of infection and death.
   
 The key issue with the coronavirus is that it is easy to acquire an infection and it spreads rapidly.
   
 "There is still a large percentage of the population that are susceptible, and we don't have a vaccine, and this is a highly contagious virus," McKinsey said. "It doesn't take much to start a new outbreak."
   
 The speed of reopening will determine whether the pandemic reignites with exponential growth, which would put Missouri back on the wrong side of the curve, Geng said.
   
 "Unless there is a strong seasonal affect, and there could be, but if there is not, it is hard for me to see us getting through the next six to 12 months without things getting worse and requiring us to intensify again," Geng said. "We will have to be judicious and smart about how we go about it."
   
 The first wave of infection taught health care providers how to ramp up for any new outbreaks, Ilboudo said. It has also shown the importance of identifying and rapidly tracing contacts of infected people to limit the spread of contagion.
   
 She, too, called for a cautious reopening.
   
 "Things are not going back to the way they used to be because we don't know how long we will have the wave of this virus," Ilboudo said. "We may not ever go back to way things were before, but we can at least start slowly getting back to some normalcy."

Luella Agnes Owen was born Sept. 8, 1856 in St. Joseph. Her father, James A. Owen, was a successful lawyer, and her mother, Agnes Cargill Owen, was a well- educated daughter from a wealthy, slave-owning family. Luella and her siblings were all educated at home by their mother until they could read and write.
   
 Luella was a tomboy by today's standards. She liked to roam around outside, dig in the dirt, and explore caves -- go spelunking. Her father worried about her and forbid her to go into caves alone, so she talked her friends and siblings into going with her.
   
 When the Civil War came along and St. Joseph was occupied by Union soldiers, the family had to exercise great care due to their Southern background. Consequently, Luella and her siblings went back to home schooling and stayed very close to home.
   
 Following the war, Luella attended the new St. Joseph High School and graduated with honors. It is thought that her higher education was self-taught as there are no records of her attending any college. She read and studied everything she could find on caves, rocks, and Missouri soil. She also continued to explore caves first hand.
   
 After her father died in 1890, she began going on field trips with other spelunkers. As ladies were not allowed to wear jeans, she wore long split skirts that skimmed the tops of her boots. Sometimes she was not allowed to go because she was a woman, but most of the time she managed to go into the caves she wanted to see first hand.
   
 Between 1890 and 1900, Luella explored hundreds of Missouri's 3,500 caves, as well as many in South Dakota and other midwestern states. Becoming an expert along the way, she wrote "Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills," which was published in 1898. It was the first and only book about Missouri caves for nearly fifty years.
   
 Luella Agnes Owen was a scientist and explorer. Her published works gave others essential information about Missouri caves. She continued to teach, lecture, and write until her death on May 31, 1932. Owen is buried in Mount Mora Cemetery in St. Joseph.
   
 Today there are more than 7,300 documented caves in Missouri. Only Tennessee has more.
   
 In 1975, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, along with the Missouri Department of Conservation, the Missouri Speleological Survey, and the Missouri Caves Associates, began pushing for legislation to protect and preserve Missouri caves. The Cave Resources Act was passed in 1980.
   
 Spelunkers motto: "Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints."
