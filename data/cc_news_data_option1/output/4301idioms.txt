Some thought introducing a pair of new coaches to the Sunflower Showdown last year might make this rivalry more competitive than it previously was when Bill Snyder owned the series. But it seems like the Wildcats have widened their lead on the Jayhawks since Klieman arrived in Manhattan.
 It's fair to wonder how long it will take KU to become competitive in this rivalry and if it will win a game this season.
 For K-State, it's a different story. The Wildcats remain on top of the Big 12 standings following Saturday's blowout victory, but fans will have mixed reactions to this game.
 The offense found a nice rhythm in the second half, and many reserve players saw action. But it was far from impressive early on. The defense played well, but how much does that mean against a hapless opponent? The Wildcats will need more than excellent play on special teams to remain in the Big 12 championship mix as they enter the difficult closing stretch of their schedule.
 The Wildcats hit the road next week for a game against West Virginia. Until then, they will celebrate another victory over the Jayhawks. And they will keep using Special Teams U as their nickname.

He’s also a certified CAD (computer aided design) technician, so he made some revisions to his bag’s pattern and learned how to do acid etching so he could put a brass plate on it when completed.
 Sinbazo also found a stop sign in his neighborhood, and he’s been turning that into pieces of armor.
 “I’ve been performing here and there. I do a podcast with five other comedians where we play the roleplaying game Pathfinder, and we do that over Zoom live so our listeners can join in and ask us questions while we’re playing,” he said. “We also started doing a spinoff show called LaughFinder Game Night, where we have a guest join us and we play games on Facebook Live.”
 That podcast invites listeners to play along at the end of the show, and if the hosts get beat, the listener wins a T-shirt from the LaughFinder website.
 As soon as stay-at-home restrictions started to get pulled back in August, Sinbazo headlined a show in suburban Maryland and has been doing a series of outdoor comedy shows over the last couple of months—sometimes in fields, sometimes in parking lots, and once over an overpass in Baltimore.
 “A lot of the stuff I talk about today is how to stay busy during COVID, how to go to work, what people are doing with their hair, and things like that,” Sinbazo said. “It’s a new world we are living in, but you can still find plenty of funny things to talk about.”
 As an English major in college, Backle noted she’s always been a writer and find inspiration for her songs from a “deep place of hurt.”
 “It’s the way that I process things and words just come to me when I’m sitting down, playing my guitar. I don’t usually have control of what comes out—I’m just a conduit if you will,” Backle said. “I’ve been writing all my life and this last year it has come out in a lyrical way. This year has given me a chance to use my writing to connect with people and their hurt.”
 Since touring isn’t an option right now, Azure Wolf is trying to stay busy on social media and will continue to do livestreams and outdoor events when they become available.
 “With our livestream events, we try to get other local musicians involved because we know so many bands who are trying to get onto these livestreams and we want to give the community a way to hear great music and stay safe,” Backle said. “We really appreciate the love and support we’ve seen and hopefully we will continue to bring it!”

Gurugram Amid the rising air pollution levels, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has asked all the deputy commissioners of NCR districts in the state to focus on dust containment in their respective districts.On Saturday, Gurugram's air quality remained in the 'very poor' category for the second consecutive day, with an air quality index (AQI) of 325, as per the data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). On Friday, the city had recorded an AQI of 334 ('very poor') owing to increased PM2.5 level in the air.The HSPCB's move comes after the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) warned of further deterioration in air quality for the next two days. In all likelihood, the situation is likely to prevail for the next two days as per the predictions made by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which Epca shared with the state pollution board. On October 23, Jai Bhagwan, senior scientist at HSPCB, issued a letter to all the deputy commissioners of national capital region (NCR) districts of Haryana, asking them to take precautionary measures. "Epca issued a red alert on further worsening of air quality based on the IMD forecast. So, districts have been asked to control dust pollution, and vehicular and industrial pollution. We have asked them to take strict precautionary measures under Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) to at least prevent air quality from getting into 'severe' category'," said Bhagwan.According to him, in Gurugram, dust is a major contributor of air pollution. "Dust pollution is due to excessive construction activity in the city. Constriction material lies uncovered, and construction and demolition (C&D) waste is dumped along roadside. Therefore, we have directed the district to increase water sprinkling in dust prone areas and usage of anti-smog guns at the construction sites," said Bhagwan. As reported by HT on October 22, a CPCB-led task force appointed to check air pollution in NCR region found shortcomings in dust control measures of Gurugram. According to the task force, Udyog Vihar (phase 1 and 5), and sectors 14 and 18 are major hot spots of dust pollution. To tackle the situation, regional officers of the pollution board are directed to conduct night patrolling in industrial areas.Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, said that six teams have been constituted for night patrolling in the city. "Three teams each will conduct patrolling in north and south parts of the city. Other land-owning agencies have also been informed about it." Shakti Singh, nodal officer for Grap implementation in Gurugram, said, "Since October 15, agencies are imposing more than Rs 1 lakh as fine every day on activities causing dust pollution. More than Rs 7 lakh has been collected from offenders as penalties."Even Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Saturday directed teams for strict enforcement of pollution control measures. In its order, Vinay Pratap Singh, MCG commissioner, said that buildings can be sealed in case of violation at the construction site. Also, water and sewer disconnection can be done in case of violation by households, and commercial, institutional or industrial units. Despite repeated attempts, Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri could not be contacted for comment. Low wind speed causing pollutionExperts attributed the reasons for poor air quality to slower winds making it difficult for particulate matter - PM2.5 and PM10 - to dissipate. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said that accumulation of pollutants due to low wind speed has led to very poor air quality in the region. "It will continue till October 27 when the wind speed can improve to over 15 kmph, which currently has been blowing at 6kmph. These are easterly winds from Punjab and Haryana region, along with north-westerly and northern winds. Besides, pollutants due to stubble burning coming through easterly winds, particulate matter emitted through vehicles, industries and dust are equally getting accumulated in the Delhi-NCR region," said Srivastava."During the night, the wind speed is comparatively less compared to the daytime. Therefore, the dispersal of pollutants is restricted," he said.

Chandigarh cop turns snake catcher, winning hearts Living up to the Chandigarh Police motto, We care for you, constable Krishan Triyala turned snake-catcher for residents the other day. After spotting a black snake, panicky residents of Darshani Bagh in Manimajra called up the police for help. Posted at the beat box, constable Krishan was prompt to turn up with his team. When residents told him that the snake is hiding in the bushes near a pipe, the cop did not waste a second in catching the snake and carefully put it in a gunny bag, much to the respite of residents. After boycotting MC House meet, BJP members go incommunicado There was an eerie silence in the Chandigarh BJP rank and file last Tuesday after 18 of the 20 party councillors boycotted the general House meeting. The meeting was scheduled for 2pm. But when only one BJP councillor turned up by 2.30pm, mayor Raj Bala Malik adjourned the meeting. Generally a call away and always keen to respond to media queries, the BJP councillors didn't respond to calls nor to messages as mediapersons started calling them up, looking for conclusive answers. The party's Chandigarh chief, Arun Sood, too was incommunicado. It was only late in the evening that murmurs of the party issuing a press statement started doing the rounds. Finally, the press note landed at 8pm after which BJP councillors started calling back.

The heartbroken owner has put up posters around town and shared the word on social media. She has even appealed to the snatchers to return her pet and take the reward. Though police have registered the case, there is still no sign of the dog despite the incident being captured on CCTV camera. Ramlila gets new script after audience pre-empts dialogues The Navyug Ramlila and Dussehra Committee, Sector 7, Chandigarh, was one of the few stage performances since the start of the Navratras. Director Pardeep Kumar said that people had been watching the performance for years so much so that now they have memorised the dialogues. "The audience was stealing the thunder of our actors, pre-emptively speaking the dialogue before the character could. I had to rewrite the script last year so that this would stop," he said. This year, the number of visitors has dropped drastically as compared to previous years, but Kumar is satisfied with his troupe's performance. Break from Covid testing in markets during festive season Amid the festival season and growing rush in the markets, the Chandigarh health department is not in favour of deploying Covid-19 mobile testing teams in the city's shopping areas. Senior officials say it will lead to chaos in the markets even if one person tests positive among hundreds. "Arranging resources is not an issue but we need to keep in mind such decisions do backfire. It will do more harm than good. Anybody can walk in to get tested at sampling centres across the city," a senior official said.

Gurugram Concerned about the rising incidence of chain- snatching and house-breaking by organised criminal gangs, the Sector 56 police has advised the residents' welfare association(RWA) Sector 57 to install closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras for crime prevention and better management of law and order. The move was felt to be necessary after a 67-year-old retired professor of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) was brutally attacked at her residence in Sector 57 on Thursday afternoon by an unidentified man posing as a courier delivery person, said the police. As per police officials, they could not get any lead on the suspect as all the three CCTV cameras in the area were defunct. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that police patrolling has been strengthened in the area and motorbike patrolling has been increased. Sector 56 police officers have been instructed to advice the members of the local RWA to install CCTV cameras for better management of law and order. The presence of CCTV cameras also acts as a deterrent against crimes, he added. A team of police and residents took a round of the area after the incident on Thursday and identified at least 18 such spots where CCTV cameras were required to be installed. The police said high-definition (HD) CCTV cameras are required on the street. The CCTV cameras along with the control room set-up will cost nearly ₹3 lakh and the RWA will have to foot the bill. Joginder Singh, a former RWA president, said that they had earlier also planned to install cameras but the necessary funds could be raised. "We will again approach all the residents and request them to contribute money for their safety," he said. Rao added that CCTV cameras installed at a gap of 500 metres would help to keep a tab on unidentified and suspected persons. Rao said he has asked all station house officers(SHOs) to organise public interaction with RWAs in various parts of the city, and include senior citizens in the meetings. Such meetings were held on Saturday in Palam Vihar, Sector 5 and Sohna Road, wherein the police officers stressed on the need of installing CCTV cameras. Attar Singh Ruhil, vice president of RWA, said that they have requested the developer, Ansal Buildwell, to contribute and help them in securing their lanes. The cameras are required in the vulnerable spots from where the maximum number of cases of snatching and thefts have been reported. "Once the cameras are installed it will help in curbing crime and making residents feel more safe, he said. Ajay Pandita, vice president, Ansal Buildwell Limited said that they have already installed CCTV cameras in certain locations in the area and are ready to support police and RWA members. "We have intensified security in the area and asked security guards to alert police in case they find anything suspicious in the area. We will increase the guards so that all lanes can be covered," he said.

Gurugram The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to install GPS tackers and cameras to track and monitor the movement of water sprinklers and road-sweeping machines across the city. This is meant to ensure compliance with the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures to counter air pollution in the city, said the civic body officials on Saturday.Officials privy to the matter said that they have been receiving complaints that workers were only watering or cleaning 100-200 metres of a particular stretch of a road and leaving the rest of it as is. Therefore, in order to overcome this problem, MCG officials have decided to install GPS on all water sprinkler machines and cameras on all road-sweeping machines.There are 51 water sprinklers and 10 road-sweeping machines in the city, all of which are managed by the MCG. These have been put to use at the stretches with a high volume of traffic, dust-accumulation since October 15 as part of the measures.As per MCG officials, they have come across instances, where workers simply clicked a picture of them sprinkling water or using a road-sweeping machine at a particular stretch as evidence of the work being done."With rising pollution levels in the city, we are taking all measures to curb environmental violations as well as initiate remedial measures, such as the sprinkling of water and cleaning of stretches with a high volume of traffic and dust accumulation. We have found these remedial measures to be effective in reducing localised air pollution levels. As such, to ensure that they continue to be properly implemented we have decided to install GPS trackers and cameras on these machines," said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.As per MCG officials privy to the matter, the process of fitting cameras and GPS machines will start from next month onwards.Around 10 road-sweeping machines were procured by MCG earlier this year from the Haryana government. Prior to that the civic body had outsourced mechanical cleaning of roads to a Delhi- based contractor. The MCG also has 51 water sprinklers, of which 42 were launched on October 15 -- the day when Grap measures came into effect. According to a senior MCG official privy to the matter, the civic body gauges the effectiveness of its remedial measures from studying and analysing the data collected by the MCG's air lab in Sector 42.MCG's air lab opened on October 15 and tracks the hourly data of air-quality via 24 monitors installed across different parts of the city."Depending on the level of air pollution in a particular area, we accordingly allocate our resources. For example, in areas where pollution levels are high, we increase mechanised road-sweeping and sprinkling of stretches with water. We also study this data on a periodic basis, to check if pollution levels have increased or decreased due to our remedial measures," said the official.Citing an example of analysing data of the air lab, MCG officials said that the biggest drop in the air quality index (AQI) in the city was at Teri Gram where the AQI fell from 298 to 190 between October 18 to October 22. Similarly, at Sector 14 the AQI rose from 116 on October 18 to 354 on October 22.

You can now either dump out your potato water and start from scratch or reuse it to cook your green beans. I'm a fan of efficiency. Either way, put your fresh green beans in some boiling water and let them cook until they're tender-crisp, about 4 to 5 minutes. While they're cooking, fill a large bowl with ice water. When your beans are ready, use a slotted spoon to transfer them from the boiling water to their icy bath. This stops the cooking (so they don't end up too mushy) and preserves their color.

Writer-director Scott Frank had only written and directed one film of note before tackling this seven-part Netflix series - the 2007 movie “The Lookout.” But among the great scripts he’s turned out are “Out of Sight,” “Minority Report,” and “Logan.” His script for “The Queen’s Gambit” comes from the 1983 novel by Walter Tevis, another writer who doesn’t like to repeat himself. His previous books include “The Hustler” and “The Man Who Fell to Earth.”
 The result in this meeting of minds between Frank and the late Tevis (he died in 1984) is a film about a young, anxiety-ridden, tranquilizer-addicted, alcoholic chess prodigy who finds herself on track to becoming a world champion player. It’s engrossing and exciting, it’s an emotional thriller, it’s an elegant, beautifully acted piece of filmmaking, and you don’t have to know anything about chess to get wrapped up in it.
 The protagonist is Beth, played by a few different actresses at different ages - one when she’s orphaned, another as she grows up in the orphanage, a third just before she’s adopted and starts a new life. It’s the third, the young adult Beth, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, who is at the center of the series. And from the time she takes over the part, Taylor-Joy is in pretty much every scene, doing yeoman’s work creating the character and letting us see her believably develop.

Concerned about the rising incidence of chain-snatching and house-breaking by organised criminal gangs, the Sector 56 police has advised the residents' welfare association(RWA) Sector 57 to install closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras for crime prevention and better management of law and order.
 The move was felt to be necessary after a 67-year-old retired professor of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) was brutally attacked at her residence in Sector 57 on Thursday afternoon by an unidentified man posing as a courier delivery person, said the police.
 As per police officials, they could not get any lead on the suspect as all the three CCTV cameras in the area were defunct.
 KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that police patrolling has been strengthened in the area and motorbike patrolling has been increased. Sector 56 police officers have been instructed to advice the members of the local RWA to install CCTV cameras for better management of law and order. The presence of CCTV cameras also acts as a deterrent against crimes, he added.
 A team of police and residents took a round of the area after the incident on Thursday and identified at least 18 such spots where CCTV cameras were required to be installed.
 The police said high-definition (HD) CCTV cameras are required on the street. The CCTV cameras along with the control room set-up will cost nearly ₹3 lakh and the RWA will have to foot the bill.
 Joginder Singh, a former RWA president, said that they had earlier also planned to install cameras but the necessary funds could be raised. "We will again approach all the residents and request them to contribute money for their safety," he said.
 Rao added that CCTV cameras installed at a gap of 500 metres would help to keep a tab on unidentified and suspected persons.
 Rao said he has asked all station house officers(SHOs) to organise public interaction with RWAs in various parts of the city, and include senior citizens in the meetings. Such meetings were held on Saturday in Palam Vihar, Sector 5 and Sohna Road, wherein the police officers stressed on the need of installing CCTV cameras.
 Attar Singh Ruhil, vice president of RWA, said that they have requested the developer, Ansal Buildwell, to contribute and help them in securing their lanes. The cameras are required in the vulnerable spots from where the maximum number of cases of snatching and thefts have been reported. "Once the cameras are installed it will help in curbing crime and making residents feel more safe, he said.
 Ajay Pandita, vice president, Ansal Buildwell Limited said that they have already installed CCTV cameras in certain locations in the area and are ready to support police and RWA members. "We have intensified security in the area and asked security guards to alert police in case they find anything suspicious in the area. We will increase the guards so that all lanes can be covered," he said.

Auto major Tata Motors on Saturday said its passenger vehicle vertical has crossed 40 lakh cumulative production milestone, nearly three decades after it rolled out its first model in the segment - Tata Sierra SUV in 1991. The company, which over the years has produced models like the Indica, Sierra, Sumo, Safari and the Nano, had achieved the 10 lakh production mark for passenger vehicles in 2005-06 and 30 lakh milestone in 2015.
 "This is a very significant milestone for Tata Motors. Very few players in the industry have reached such a milestone. This has been a long journey since we rolled out Tata Sierra in 1991," Tata Motors President Passenger Vehicles Business Unit (PVBU) Shailesh Chandra told .
 Over the years, the company always challenged the conventions and brought in many path breaking products, many times first in the market, like Sierra, Estate, Safari, Indica and the Nano, he added.
 With Sierra, the company took its first shot at the SUV segment in the country. The company consolidated it further with Safari.
 Further in honour of the legacy of Sumant Moolgaonkar, Tata Motors introduced the first ever multi purpose vehicle in Tata Sumo. With Indica, the company changed the customer perception in terms of how a passenger vehicle is received.
 The company set up the PVBU vertical in 1998 and the first product to roll out under its aegis was Indica.
 "It was the first indigenously developed car and since then we have always challenged conventions and have strived to bring in technologies which are supportive of the cause of the nation, whether it is safety or things related to sustainability," Chandra noted.
 The company has been focussing not only on the safety aspect of its vehicles but has also been leading the electric vehicle space in the country, he said.
 "We have brought a paradigm shift to the industry that safety is also important otherwise it was not taken that seriously and to ensure that we were also the first company to commission crash safety testing in the country," Chandra said.
 The company's compact SUV Nexon was the first model in the country to receive a 5-star rating from Global Ncap. Tata Motors is also the country's largest electric vehicle manufacturer with 67 per cent market share.
 It currently sells Nexon EV and two trims of Tigor, with different range, in the electric vehicle segment. The company also has ambitious plans to launch further electrified models in the future, with an electric version of its premium hatchback Altroz next in the line.
 Chandra said with greater acceptance of its current model line up, the company would be able to reach the next 10 lakh production mark in much lesser time.
 "It will take us a shorter time to achieve the next one million production mark. This should be on the back of the Indian growth story as well.
 "So the industry should also reach higher peaks. It has been growing, barring last year and this year as well due to the pandemic, but the underlined fundamentals of the passenger vehicle industry remain intact whether it is from penetration perspective or buying capacity of people," Chandra said.
 From all the angles the growth story should come back as the economy also stabilises post pandemic, he added.
 "So on the back of that growth and certain actions that we are taking to strengthen our product portfolio and the traction we are already seeing, I am sure the next one million should be faster then three to four million mark," Chandra said.
 The company now sells five BSVI compliant models -- Tiago, Tigor, Nexon, Harrier and the Altroz.
 Tata Motors has manufacturing facilities at Chikhali, Pune; Sanand in Gujarat; and a joint venture plant with Fiat at Ranjangaon in Pune.

As an autobiographical period piece meant to be evocative of the works from Federico Fellini and François Truffaut, _Armageddon Time_ might pose a scary title, but it's said to be a warm and emotional piece reflective of Gray's previous film, _Two Lovers_ (and, for my money, one of his finest films yet).

Cate Blanchett and director Eli Roth made for an unlikely pair when they collaborated on 2018's darkly comedic family fantasy film, _The House with a Clock in its Walls_. But the resulting film is one of the best-reviewed films in Roth's filmography, and it became a stealthy hit at the box office to boot. So, it might not be terribly surprising to learn that Blanchett and Roth are planning to reunite for an upcoming project. Nevertheless, it's surprising that the movie they picked is an adaptation of Gearbox Software's apocalyptic video game series, _Borderlands._
