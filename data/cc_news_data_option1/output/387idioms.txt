Yes. And thank you Steve for the following up on the other part of your question, on the $4 billion savings from a full year implementation of IngenioRx. We're actually very excited about that, because at the end of the day, that $4 billion in savings makes healthcare more affordable.

You don't have -- if you see the product, we don't have overlap of products and our customers are looking for people they can talk system with. And the match of those two companies is like hand in glove from an electrified propulsion standpoint as well from -- as well as from a combustion standpoint and commercial vehicle standpoint.

It seems that Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has taken that on board – so much so that he even applies it to dogs.

At the end of the day it's all about a combination of rates, but also the medical management programs that we have in place as well to support our members. We say all the time and it's true we're very focused on whole person care. We have worked very closely with complex and specialized populations and making sure that our members are getting care in the most appropriate setting.

He said: “I congratulate the newly appointed Permanent Secretaries, and welcome you on board. The position you attain is very important and sensitive in the running of this administration, therefore, a lot is expected of you. You are expected to be the champions of our restoration agenda.


--DocBreak--
Thank you, Pete. Great question. And in terms of the improvement, we are very, very happy with some of the operational efficiencies and just some of the better processes that we now have, things that really make the experience better and easier for the customer. And at the end of the day, that's the most important part.

Noah first we were impressed by the electronics knowhow overall and the scale that -- and the talent and the capabilities on the electronics. First, power electronics, this is world-class. Delphi Technologies is really ahead of the curve. I think they're a year advanced than others. The power modules, the Viper, the 800-volt inverters all this was looked at in great detail from a software standpoint, from a system management standpoint. This was clearly as we start talking really became obvious that this was just a world-class technology that they're running.


--DocBreak--
Yep. Okay. That makes sense. And then just a follow-up on management. There was no mention Rick of you staying on board. I mean, given that Delphi is going through a pretty heavy sort of launch and rationalization process in the business, what's your commitment to the combined entity? Are you going to be staying on for a number of years? How have you guys worked that out?

Thank you for the question. Yes we're very, very pleased about what we saw during the AEP season. Frankly, it was some of the strongest growth we've ever seen. And we look forward to being able to continue to grow our business over the course of the year. As you know, we are focused very much, not just on our MA population, but also duals as well and we are consistently bringing in business with respect to that over the course of the year.


--DocBreak--
And then again, we're really pleased with what we saw in the Part D growth this year. It's really the first year that we've been competitive in the Medicare Part D. Ingenio gives us an opportunity to also be more competitive in Medicare Advantage, our individual and group membership. So across the board, we see it as a nice growth accelerator for both commercial and government. Thanks very much for the question. Next question, please.

Fayemi stressed that he was more determined to serve the people who voted his administration to power noting that the experience since coming on board has further strengthened his resolve that “Ekiti people deserve nothing but the best.”

Yeah. Thank you, A.J. That was the individual margin normalization versus Medicaid. We have been talking all along about how those two mitigated each other. As we finalized our plans for 2020 and we've been working very, very hard with the states and everything else, we expect that the margin normalization from individual will probably be about 10 basis points worse in terms of margin than the incremental benefit that we expect to achieve from improvement in the Medicaid business.

And as we announced last week, we were pleased to welcome two new Medicaid health plans into Anthem. The new plans in Missouri and Nebraska allow us to expand our industry-leading specialized care to more than 300,000 new consumers bringing our full Medicaid reach to a total of 23 states in the District of Columbia.

The startup's timeframe is ambitious. According to Burns, the company will show the pickup in Detroit this June, begin crash testing it in July and then start hiring workers to build the vehicles in September. Production will start in November or December of this year.
 Should it all come to life, the Lordstown Motors Endurance could edge out numerous rival electric pickup on the horizon. The Rivian R1T is the closest to production from a startup, while the Tesla Cybertruck remains a couple years out. General Motors and Ford also have electric trucks in the pipeline, with the former poised to reintroduce the Hummer nameplate for its EV pickup.

Sen. Susan Collins should stop the outrage about a single comment by a House member. Stop passing notes to the Chief Justice about deportment. This is not second grade. Ask for the president’s resignation. If the consequence is that members of her party turn on her, it’s a small price to pay to save the nation. It's Collins’ duty to do the right thing before it’s too late.


--DocBreak--
Yeah. Let me make a comment, John, in terms of my job right now is to run the day-to-day business of Delphi Technologies, make sure we get the shareholder approval across the board in April, and make sure I work with Fred and his team to establish a detailed plan to execute a successful integration of our two companies in the near future. That's our focus. And Fred and I will take it from there.

I too am stunned. In light of the horrifying and offensive words and deeds being examined regarding President Donald Trump, is it truly Nadler's pertinent and passionate discussion Collins finds worthy of rebuke?


--DocBreak--
Yes, that's it. Thanks Steve and thanks Gail. It's exactly, right. We're very pleased with our fully insured growth. You saw that play through in 2019. We've experienced growth in the large group and four out of the last five quarters. And as Gail said, the flat nature of our growth in 2020 is really this one large account, which is not really that unusual in light of the fact that the HIF coming back and a very large account moving from fully insured to ASO.


--DocBreak--
The systems migration is going to be 80% complete by the end of this year. And then, we can continue on from there. Gail talked about a six to two. So I would say that, just given some of those issues the improvement is not going to be linear through 2023. It will be a little bit better here in the first few years, as we get through the systems migration as we're investing heavily in digital right now and as we get those capabilities up and running, for instance, that maybe there's a bit of a heavier load.

I've read in several news outlets that Sen. Susan Collins was “stunned” by comments made by Rep. Jerry Nadler during the impeachment proceedings. She apparently feels parts of the language Nadler used to describe the behavior of some senators was out of line with the decorum normally expected. Collins explained she feels rules were broken by Nadler, whose comments, in her opinion, impugned the character of Senate members. According to Collins, were it a more typical day in the Senate, those words might be struck from the record.


--DocBreak--
Thanks. Before I get to my question, I just want to follow-up on Ralph's quickly. In terms of being at the higher end of the range ex that $50 million you still would have been around $86 million to $88 million [ph]. I don't know what the flu costs are. But it's been a trend of two to three quarters now where it's been pushing towards the high end rather than the midpoint. And if you guys understand that from our viewpoint, it's hard to understand what's driving that? So is there anything you can tell us that would give us comfort that there's not some trend inside the business that maybe hasn't been fully taken account, might be a headwind to the 2020?
