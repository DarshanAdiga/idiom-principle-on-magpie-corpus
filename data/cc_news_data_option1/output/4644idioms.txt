DETROIT (AP) — General Motors is recalling nearly 69,000 Chevrolet Bolt electric cars worldwide because the batteries have caught fire in five of them.The company says it doesn’t know yet what’s causing the fires, but engineers are working around the clock to figure it out. Two people have suffered smoke inhalation due to the blazes.Bolt Executive Chief Engineer Jesse Ortega says dealers will install software that limits charging to 90% of the battery’s capacity until a permanent fix is developed. The recall covers Bolts from the 2017 through 2019 model years, including nearly 51,000 in the U.S.It comes one month after the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it is investigating the Bolt fires. The agency said in documents filed last month that the fires began under the rear seat while the cars were parked and unattended.Ortega says engineers have traced the fires to Bolts with battery cells made at an LG Chem factory in Ochang, South Korea, from May of 2016 to May of 2019. The fires have happened when the batteries were close to being fully charged, he said. “We have no confirmed incidents from vehicles with cells not produced at this factory or a lower state of charge,” Ortega said. Some 2019 Bolts and all 2020 and 2021 versions have cells made at an LG Chem plant in Holland, Michigan, and are not included in the recall, he said. GM hopes to find the cause and have a permanent repair as quickly as possible after the first of the year, Ortega said. Engineers are looking at several potential causes and don’t have a prevailing theory, he told reporters Friday on a conference call.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

This season, women’s basketball teams are allowed to play open the season with an official game on Nov. 25. Nebraska’s schedule hasn’t been announced because it doesn’t have the conference schedule yet.
 Nebraska is tentatively scheduled to host North Dakota State on Nov. 25 and play Creighton in Omaha on Dec. 14, according to the opponents' schedules.
 From last season Nebraska lost five of its top seven scorers due to transfer (Leigha Brown, Ashtyn Veerbeek), medical retirement (Taylor Kissinger) or graduation (Hannah Whitish, Nicea Eliely).
 Brown transferred to Michigan and is immediately eligible.

The screen, while certainly small, is bright and sharp, apparently displaying the exact pixel dimensions of the original Nintendo game. It plays well, too — the controls are responsive, though it feels strange to play the game on anything other than an original NES controller. The buttons of the Game & Watch are a bit softer than I'd like — but they were good enough that I cleared the first set of levels without any real frustration other than my own lack of skill.

ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas (KLTV) - Looking at the weather outside, we are definitively still in a fall season and winter is nowhere to be seen. My ten-day weather forecast shows a low of 42 for the Lufkin area early in the week of Thanksgiving.If you are looking to plant trees or shrubs, fall is undoubtedly our best time to plant. When planted in the fall, trees and shrubs are given as much time as possible to get established before our typically hot, dry summers. Research trials and worlds of experience have proven this many times.Years ago, I was visiting with a local landscape retailer and he told me that he planted year-round to stay in business. You can do that if you take great care of a newly planted perennial during the frequent summer droughts. More recently, I was in visiting with a local grower that stated he preferred folks wait until February to plant. Upon further questioning, he preferred that because that’s when his new tree crop was prepared for sale!So, while you can wait as some do until spring when the gardening fever, establishing woody plants long before they reach our difficult summer season is by far a better bet.Regardless of when you plant, determine your soil’s drainage and adaptability to the tree you wish to plant. Poor draining soils where water can stand will not be a good choice to plant most fruit trees such as peach, pears, figs, and pecans.You can test your soil’s drainage with a simple percolation test. Dig a hole 1 foot deep, fill with water, and see how long it takes to empty. If the water level drops more slowly than 1 inch per hour, drainage is poor.Always check for underground utilities before digging. One phone call to 811 from anywhere in Texas will route your call to a state service which will alert homeowners of underground pipelines, phone lines, water/sewer, and power lines. Local utility technicians will mark your property with flags within two full business days of the request. There is no charge to you for this service and folks are often surprised to find out where buried utilities are and are not located on their property.Don’t plant anything that will get over 15 feet tall under a powerline. Moving away from powerlines makes it a safer tree that will look better in its natural form.Start the planting process by clearing vegetation and mulch from the site at least six inches beyond the proposed hole or bed. Research has shown that removing vegetation and mulching up to three feet from the trunk will double the rate of growth. More importantly, this keeps weed- eaters and mower-decks away from harming young, tender tree trunks.For normal planting in well-drained soil, the hole for an individual plant should be at least one-and-a-half to two times the width of the root ball and only as deep as the root ball or soil mass. Look carefully for the soil line in which the tree originally grew. Discoloration on the bark near ground level of bare-root plants indicates the soil level.Do not dig the hole deeper than the root ball. Digging a hole too deep can cause the plant to settle deeper than what it wants to best grow. If the top of the root ball is set below the surface of surrounding soil, even by only three inches, water can collect in the planting hole, resulting in a lack of oxygen to the roots.In poorly drained or compacted soil, make the hole three to four times the width of the root ball and not quite as deep as the root ball.Amending the backfill when planting trees and shrubs has been debated for decades. In all but exceptional circumstances where the soil is very poor, extensive research has shown no need to incorporate any amendments, fertilizers, living organisms, water- holding gels, humic acids, or organic products into the backfill soil. Simply use the loosened soil that came out of the planting hole. Loosen and break up large clods of soil and remove large rocks before backfilling.The exception to not adding backfill amendments is where existing soil is so poor that all soil in the area needs to be replaced with good quality soil. Incorporation of organic matter when planting in very sandy or gravelly soils will also increase the water-holding capacity.The last two steps after planting is to water the tree in well and add mulch. There are countless air-pockets in the ground that will dry out roots. A good soaking will eliminate them and get the tree off to a great start. Adding an organic mulch at a depth of no more than three inches (when settled) at a large diameter will greatly aid the tree’s establishment.Looking at the calendar, you have several months before we experience our typical hot, dry summer. Get new trees and shrubs in the ground as soon as possible for best success.Copyright 2020 KLTV. All rights reserved.

BELMOND, Iowa (KCCI) - Devastation and sadness are sweeping through the Belmond-Klemme Community School District after the death of beloved teacher Jason Englert.Englert’s family says he tested positive for coronavirus just three days before he died.“Jason was always such a pleasure to have because he had such a positive attitude, a lot of energy, and the rapport he had with students was remarkable.” Superintendent Dan Frazier said.The 38-year-old was found dead inside his home on Sunday.“For the students, of course, it was such a shock at first. Many of our students had trouble knowing how to register this,” Frazier said.Wright County has been hit hard with the virus. That’s why the Belmond-Klemme School District did a mass testing last week.Englert’s family says that’s how he learned he was positive. He eventually started to develop a slight headache.“This has affected me significantly,” said Frazier, who coached volleyball alongside Englert. He said not only was he an exceptional coach but also a brilliant teacher who taught students in the gifted program.“He was just a very energetic guy, and he always had a cheerful way of looking at things. It wasn’t unusual for me to ask him how it was going, and he would say things like, ‘Living the dream,’” Frazier said.That dream of teaching led Englert to a few school districts over his career.Family and colleagues say his impact on students will be his lasting legacy. “We continue to mourn for our loss, and we pray for Jason’s family,” Frazier said.Englert’s family said they don’t have an official cause of death yet, but they wonder if the virus spurred a heart attack or stroke.Copyright 2020 KCCI via CNN Newsource.

There are a few key things procedurally. The states have to start certifying their results -- that the process is over, that this is in fact the will of the voters. They'll do that between now and early December, and this leads to the formal vote of the Electoral College on Dec. 14, and they confirm the will of the voters. At this point it's all moving forward smoothly. And then it will be official. Whether Donald Trump chooses to verbally concede or not is a question, but he will have no formal mechanism once the vote is certified. And then we start looking behind the scenes and the process of the transition -- does that force some of that to move forward?
