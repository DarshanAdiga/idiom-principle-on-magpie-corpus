Roma, 4 dic. - (Adnkronos) - Una didattica digitale efficace ha contribuito a migliorare i rapporti scuola-famiglia. E' quanto emerge dall'Osservatorio ‘Ora di Futuro', che ha affidato la valutazione dell'impatto sociale generato dal progetto educativo al gruppo di ricerca Tiresia (Politecnico di Milano). Oltre la metà dei docenti, infatti, ritiene che le attività svolte attraverso la piattaforma di 'Ora di Futuro' abbiano influenzato positivamente il dialogo con le famiglie degli studenti. ‘Ora di futuro' è il progetto educativo che coinvolge gli insegnanti, le scuole primarie e le reti no profit di tutta Italia per insegnare a scuola a fare scelte responsabili e sostenere la genitorialità per famiglie fragili con bambini da 0 a 6 anni.
 Il progetto è promosso da Generali Country Italia insieme a The Human Safety Net (Thsn), l'iniziativa globale del gruppo Generali a favore delle comunità e in partnership con tre onlus: Albero della vita, Mission Bambini e Centro per la salute del bambino. La piattaforma digitale ‘Ora di Futuro' ha permesso ai ragazzi con Dsa di aumentare le loro capacità di apprendimento, di migliorare i propri risultati scolastici e di interagire meglio con i compagni di classe.
 Il 90% degli studenti dichiara di aver aumentato le proprie competenze (tematiche e legate a gestione delle risorse e rischio). Dall'analisi emerge anche un miglioramento di tutte le life skills monitorate (gestione delle emozioni, pensiero critico, prendere decisioni e pensiero creativo) con un grande miglioramento del pensiero creativo. Inoltre, il 93% degli insegnanti dichiara che userà le metodologie didattiche digitali apprese con la piattaforma anche fuori dal progetto.
 L'analisi dell'impatto condotta da Thsn ha evidenziato che la prosecuzione delle attività con le Onlus nei Centri anche da remoto ha garantito alle famiglie più fragili la continuità educativa - attraverso il supporto psicologico durante l'emergenza sanitaria e nel post emergenza - ma anche il supporto socio-educativo a favore della genitorialità, per aumentare la percezione del ruolo di genitori dando loro la possibilità di apprendere buone pratiche per lo sviluppo.
 Il forzato lockdown ha infatti evidenziato ancora di più la necessità per le realtà non profit di acquisire gli strumenti necessari a continuare le proprie attività di missione anche da remoto, in modalità digitale, in particolare per raggiungere meglio i genitori e i loro figli che vivono in situazioni di vulnerabilità.
 Per Salvatore Angelico, presidente Fondazione l'Albero della Vita Onlus, “Ora di Futuro ha permesso di portare l'attenzione sui bambini da 0 a 6 anni per interrompere il ciclo dello svantaggio sociale, intercettando e sostenendo quei bambini che, a causa della condizione di vulnerabilità, non ricevono risposte adeguate ai loro naturali bisogni di sviluppo”.
 “Nei due Villaggi per Crescere - Centri Ora di Futuro di Trieste abbiamo offerto a tutte le famiglie opportunità di sviluppo di competenze genitoriali e di superamento di fragilità, quali situazioni di solitudine e isolamento sociale, e siamo riusciti a garantire maggiori possibilità per le bambine e i bambini di sviluppare appieno il proprio potenziale” afferma Giorgio Tamburlini, presidente del Csb.
 "Siamo convinti che il benessere dei bambini passi attraverso il benessere dell'intera famiglia. Per questo siamo vicini ai genitori e ai loro bambini, costretti a trascorrere l'intera giornata a casa, proponendo loro strumenti digitali come “Patapum genitori catapultati a casa”, una piattaforma che offre loro varie attività che hanno lo scopo di garantire il benessere fisico e psicologico dei bambini e dei genitori. Davvero, insieme possiamo dare un presente e quindi anche un futuro sereno ai bambini di oggi, gli adulti di domani” afferma Goffredo Modena, presidente Fondazione Mission Bambini.

Owners will be notified in late January.Dealers will replace the engine if the bearings are damaged.All of the vehicles will get a knock sensor system to monitor symptoms that come before an engine fails.For more information on recalls, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s recall page.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

United States (US) President-elect Joe Biden has a China plan and India has a role in it. Though it may look as if it begins by making Chinese president Xi Jinping sweat for his return call -- Xi sent Biden a congratulatory message but they haven't spoken -- there is a lot more to it.Biden has not spoken about his China policy in a full-fledged foreign policy address yet, but he did lift the veil somewhat in an interview to Thomas Friedman of The New York Times, addressing a whole range of top-of-the- mind foreign policy issues.Indians anxious about Biden need not worry. Biden's China plan is far more strategic than his predecessor's approach that went from criticising China to coddling of Xi --Donald Trump made his young granddaughter sing for the visiting leader -- to a full-fledged trade war to a trade pact to daily China-bashing in the wake of the pandemic that ultimately consumed Trump's presidency.From Biden's comments to NYT, there are key takeaways.One, Biden will not do anything immediately to undo the 25% tariff on imports from China, imposed by Trump. Two, Biden intends to carry out a full review of the relationship and develop a strategy in consultation with allies in Asia and Europe. "The best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our -- or at least what used to be our -- allies on the same page," he said in the interview. "It's going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies."Three, Biden will seek to shift the focus of trade policy from Trump's deficit reduction to "actually produce progress on China's abusive practices" of forced transfer of technology, theft of intellectual property, and bolstering Chinese corporations with subsidies. Four, he aims to bulk up the US's capacity to fight by investing in research, infrastructure and education. "I want to make sure we're going to fight like hell by investing in America first."The underlying approach in Biden's remarks was consistent with what his aides were saying even before his victory. Biden would be "investing in ourselves, renewing our democracy, working with our close partners like India, asserting our value and engaging China from a position of strength", Antony Blinken, the nominee for secretary of state, had said at an outreach to Indian-Americans in August. He had added, it needs to be noted, "India has to be a key partner in that effort".The president-elect and Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the Indo-Pacific region -- another term for the threat from China -- in their call on November 17, their first after Biden's victory. But clearly, New Delhi will look for an early and explicit expression of acknowledgment of this commonality of goal and purpose, and with a sense of urgency because of the growing Chinese aggression in the neighbourhood. yashwant.raj@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal

With the IPL done and dusted and the Indian cricket team engaged in a long tour of Australia, the BCCI’s focus is now on the domestic season and how to make the most of the situation marred by the coronavirus pandemic.Will the BCCI be able to conduct all its tournaments or will some have to be skipped? The IPL, in UAE, had 8 teams and back home the Indian Super League with 11 teams is being held in a bio-secure bubble. The BCCI will understandably follow a similar practice. The BCCI Secretary Jay Shah along with treasurer Arun Dhumal visited Punjab for inspection ahead of the season.Given the situation, the BCCI have proposed a curtailed season and have asked the states for their inputs. In October, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly had said that a tentative plan had been drawn up to conduct the shortened domestic season between January and March 2021.The ProposalBCCI Secretary Jay Shah, earlier in the week, asked all the state associations how they’d like to go about with the domestic season.In an email, as per multiple reports, the BCCI listed the windows for the various tournaments with the Syed Mushtaq Ali being the start of the proposed domestic season. The BCCI has earmarked 20 December–10 January as the window for the domestic T20s. The Ranji Trophy which will span across 67 days starting 11 January through 18 March. The Vijay Hazare Trophy has been proposed between 11 January and 7 February.Where Will These Tournaments be Played?There are 38 teams in the mix for the domestic season which means hosting the tournaments will be quite the task for the BCCI and the concerned state organisations. The Hindu reported that the 38 teams will be divided into 5 Elite groups and 1 Plate group. The Elite groups will consist of 6 teams each while the Plate group will have 8 teams, and there will be 6 bio-secure bubbles.The BCCI is currently in deciding on which six cities to pick but have shortlisted Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Puducherry, Vadodara, Surat, Nagpur, Indore, Pune, Hyderabad and Kolkata.Who Picked What?Ranij Trophy champions Saurashtra, domestic heavyweights Mumbai and Tamil Nadu, along with Baroda and Punjab have backed the idea of playing only the limited-overs tournaments while the Ranji trophy runners up Bengal have picked the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and Ranji Trophy, according to ESPNCricinfo.Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka along with the Andhra Cricket Association and Vidarbha have chosen the option of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the Ranji Trophy.Haryana Cricket Association are in no hurry and Arunachal Pradesh office-bearers have chosen only T20s, according The Hindu.The BCCI is expected to finalise the plan for the season soon after Jay Shah toured several state associations to take stock. The Times of India reported that the BCCI intends to host the Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy to help scout talent for IPL 2021 and as a trial run of sorts in a year when India hosts the T20 World Cup.First-Class ContractsEarlier in October 2019, days after taking charge as BCCI president, Sourav Ganguly had said that there will be first-class contracts.However, the contracts remain a work in a progress and the BCCI are also contemplating a 'force majeure' clause if it decides to bring in a contract for all first- class cricketers, who are set to lose match fees as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put uncertainty around the 2020-21 first-class season, according to reports on 3 December.The BCCI may eventually bring in a contract system together with the state associations for first-class cricketers, meaning it could be a joint effort. However, the contracts will most likely include a force majeure clause, that may make room for calamities like the coronavirus pandemic.\"Force majeure clause is always there. You cannot foresee contingencies. All those clauses are there and it all depends on how you do it. The baseline is to help cricketers get more money so they don't struggle in their lives, concentrate on cricket. In the present scenario, there is no cricket so it is difficult to pay,\" IANS quoted a BCCI official as saying.Currently, in domestic cricket in India, players are paid according to the number of days of cricket they play.

Venezia, 4 dic. (Adnkronos/Labitalia) - A pochi giorni dall'insediamento del nuovo consiglio della Camera di Commercio di Venezia Rovigo, previsto per il 10 dicembre, il presidente Giuseppe Fedalto ha presentato questa mattina in video conferenza dalla sede camerale di Marghera, il bilancio dei primi cinque anni di attività del primo ente italiano ad aver portato a termine il processo di accorpamento tra due Camere di Commercio, il 20 luglio del 2015. Nell'ultimo mandato l'ente ha lavorato per l'efficientamento della struttura e della gestione organizzativa, ha focalizzato la sua attenzione su temi strategici di rilancio per le imprese e per il territorio ascoltando il tessuto imprenditoriale e le associazioni di categoria. Ha sfrondato i numerosi contributi e supporti finanziari a pioggia, puntando al sostegno di un numero minore di iniziative, ma di più larga portata e di maggiore impatto, facendo leva sul concetto di rete di prossimità per diffondere efficacemente iniziative e servizi volti alla digitalizzazione e allo sviluppo di impresa. “In questi cinque anni l'Ente ha dimostrato di avere il coraggio di abbattere muri di separazione territoriali, pregiudizi ed incomprensioni varando una riforma che non è stata solo la semplice somma di due realtà istituzionali Venezia e Rovigo, ma che ha dato vita a programmi di sviluppo ben precisi e di integrazione di territori complementari", ha dichiarato Giuseppe Fedalto, presidente Camera di commercio di Venezia Rovigo. "Tra gli ultimi vi è sicuramente il piano strategico per l'istituzione della zona logistica semplificata Porto di Venezia-Rodigino, che il nuovo Consiglio della Camera porterà avanti nei prossimi mesi, un l'esempio lampante di cosa significa aver lavorato in squadra nell'ultimo mandato. Una sfida impegnativa per i miei successori, ma una vittoria per tutti", ha continuato. La vendita della sede di Calle Larga XXII Marzo a Venezia, e il conseguente acquisto di Palazzo Ca' Nova sempre in centro storico, è l'operazione di razionalizzazione più importante e ponderata che l'Ente ha realizzato. Per garantire una presenza capillare sul territorio ha poi, da un lato, attivato presidi e sportelli decentrati nei Comuni a più alta densità, puntando, dall'altro, a dare vita in terraferma a una nuova “Casa delle Imprese”, che sorgerà in via Torino a Mestre. Un edificio efficiente e sostenibile, a basso impatto ambientale, connesso al mondo dell'università, della ricerca e dell'innovazione e dei servizi grazie alla vicinanza con il polo di Ca' Foscari e della Stazione Sperimentale del Vetro. Si tratta di uno tra i più importanti investimenti sul territorio (30 milioni di euro). Oltre 33 milioni di euro sono stati gli interventi economici distribuiti sul territorio, attraverso contributi diretti alle imprese, iniziative promozionali e programmi di aiuto e sostegno all'economia, oltre alle componenti accessorie e straordinarie come l'emergenza Covid-19 (7 milioni di euro) e le calamità naturali che hanno interessato il territorio come il tornado della Riviera del Brenta del 2015 (180 mila euro), il maltempo che ha danneggiato le imprese polesane nel 2018 (120 mila euro), l'eccezionale acqua alta del 12 novembre 2019 che ha colpito le imprese del litorale che va dal Tagliamento al Delta del Po e della città di Venezia (500 mila euro). Sono 4,7 milioni i contributi stanziati per favorire l'accesso al credito delle micro e piccole e medie imprese attraverso i Confidi. “Sono convinto che le risorse investite nei progetti strategici sviluppati in sinergia con il territorio abbiano contribuito a dare la percezione che gli imprenditori non sono stati lasciati soli ad affrontare le difficoltà, ma hanno avuto una spalla sicura su cui poggiare i timidi, ma incoraggianti segnali di ripresa a cui abbiamo assistito in questi cinque anni, e messi a serio rischio negli ultimi mesi dall'emergenza Covid-19", ha aggiunto Fedalto. "Le sfide future per il nuovo Consiglio saranno quindi quelle di proseguire con azioni di supporto per garantire la piena ripartenza con interventi di accompagnamento capaci di affiancare il sistema produttivo nel ritrovare stabilità e rinnovata competitività con nuove prospettive di fiducia e sicurezza di lungo periodo”, ha continuato. Pù di 15 mila le imprese che sono state coinvolte in attività di formazione sui temi del digitale, internazionalizzazione, innovazione, sostenibilità ambientale, turismo e cultura, 165 nuove imprese e 60 start up sono nate o sono state avviate grazie al supporto dell'Ente. Oltre 300 mila le pratiche telematiche gestite, grazie a un' implementazione e potenziamento dei servizi per l'E-gov e il dialogo con la Pubblica Amministrazione. 4500 sono i ragazzi degli istituti superiori delle due province e 779 le imprese direttamente coinvolte in attività di orientamento al lavoro e alle professioni, 1,6 milioni sono le risorse investite nell'ultimo triennio di cui 1,2 milioni erogati sotto forma di voucher a rimborso delle spese di tutoraggio alle aziende che hanno ospitato ragazzi in alternanza scuola lavoro. In questi cinque anni i temi dell'innovazione e del digitale sono stati fondamentali nella programmazione delle attività e dei servizi dell'Ente, che ha aderito al network dei Pid - Punti Impresa Digitale, le strutture di servizio create dal sistema camerale, dedicate alla diffusione dell'innovazione e della digitalizzazione nelle Mpmi (Micro piccole medie imprese) in attuazione del Piano Nazionale Impresa 4.0. Circa 3 milioni le risorse investite nell'ultimo triennio in progetti per la crescita digitale delle Mpmi, di cui 1,4 milioni erogati sotto forma di voucher. Oltre 2 milioni di risorse sono state stanziate per la valorizzazione del patrimonio turistico, culturale e territoriale del tessuto economico di Venezia e Rovigo a favore di progetti condivisi con le istituzioni universitarie e gli organismi culturali di rilievo sul territorio. Sul fronte dell'internazionalizzazione la Camera si è impegnata nel sostegno di attività gestite attraverso le funzione associate e coordinate a livello interprovinciale da Veneto Promozione fino al 2016 e da Nuovo Centro Estero Veneto dal 2018 al 2020. Le attività dell'ufficio camerale si sono concentrate sulla campagna internazionale di promozione del portale degli esportatori ed importatori Venicexport e sulle certificazioni per l'estero con grande spinta alla digitalizzazione. Molto è stato fatto anche sul fronte della regolazione del mercato, sulla vigilanza prodotti con quasi 4000 controlli ispettivi e oltre 50 mila sequestri cautelativi di merce non conforme. Numerose le iniziative promosse sul fronte della legalità e della sostenibilità ambientale promosse con gli imprenditori e anche con le scuole delle due province, dal servizio ambiente della Camera di commercio, costituito dalla sezione del Veneto dell'albo gestori ambientali e dall'ufficio unico ambiente delle Camere di Commercio del Veneto.

Venezia, 4 dic. (Adnkronos/Labitalia) - A pochi giorni dall'insediamento del nuovo consiglio della Camera di Commercio di Venezia Rovigo, previsto per il 10 dicembre, il presidente Giuseppe Fedalto ha presentato questa mattina in video conferenza dalla sede camerale di Marghera, il bilancio dei primi cinque anni di attività del primo ente italiano ad aver portato a termine il processo di accorpamento tra due Camere di Commercio, il 20 luglio del 2015.
 Nell'ultimo mandato l'ente ha lavorato per l'efficientamento della struttura e della gestione organizzativa, ha focalizzato la sua attenzione su temi strategici di rilancio per le imprese e per il territorio ascoltando il tessuto imprenditoriale e le associazioni di categoria. Ha sfrondato i numerosi contributi e supporti finanziari a pioggia, puntando al sostegno di un numero minore di iniziative, ma di più larga portata e di maggiore impatto, facendo leva sul concetto di rete di prossimità per diffondere efficacemente iniziative e servizi volti alla digitalizzazione e allo sviluppo di impresa.
 “In questi cinque anni l'Ente ha dimostrato di avere il coraggio di abbattere muri di separazione territoriali, pregiudizi ed incomprensioni varando una riforma che non è stata solo la semplice somma di due realtà istituzionali Venezia e Rovigo, ma che ha dato vita a programmi di sviluppo ben precisi e di integrazione di territori complementari", ha dichiarato Giuseppe Fedalto, presidente Camera di commercio di Venezia Rovigo. "Tra gli ultimi vi è sicuramente il piano strategico per l'istituzione della zona logistica semplificata Porto di Venezia-Rodigino, che il nuovo Consiglio della Camera porterà avanti nei prossimi mesi, un l'esempio lampante di cosa significa aver lavorato in squadra nell'ultimo mandato. Una sfida impegnativa per i miei successori, ma una vittoria per tutti", ha continuato.
 La vendita della sede di Calle Larga XXII Marzo a Venezia, e il conseguente acquisto di Palazzo Ca' Nova sempre in centro storico, è l'operazione di razionalizzazione più importante e ponderata che l'Ente ha realizzato. Per garantire una presenza capillare sul territorio ha poi, da un lato, attivato presidi e sportelli decentrati nei Comuni a più alta densità, puntando, dall'altro, a dare vita in terraferma a una nuova “Casa delle Imprese”, che sorgerà in via Torino a Mestre. Un edificio efficiente e sostenibile, a basso impatto ambientale, connesso al mondo dell'università, della ricerca e dell'innovazione e dei servizi grazie alla vicinanza con il polo di Ca' Foscari e della Stazione Sperimentale del Vetro. Si tratta di uno tra i più importanti investimenti sul territorio (30 milioni di euro).
 Oltre 33 milioni di euro sono stati gli interventi economici distribuiti sul territorio, attraverso contributi diretti alle imprese, iniziative promozionali e programmi di aiuto e sostegno all'economia, oltre alle componenti accessorie e straordinarie come l'emergenza Covid-19 (7 milioni di euro) e le calamità naturali che hanno interessato il territorio come il tornado della Riviera del Brenta del 2015 (180 mila euro), il maltempo che ha danneggiato le imprese polesane nel 2018 (120 mila euro), l'eccezionale acqua alta del 12 novembre 2019 che ha colpito le imprese del litorale che va dal Tagliamento al Delta del Po e della città di Venezia (500 mila euro). Sono 4,7 milioni i contributi stanziati per favorire l'accesso al credito delle micro e piccole e medie imprese attraverso i Confidi.
 “Sono convinto che le risorse investite nei progetti strategici sviluppati in sinergia con il territorio abbiano contribuito a dare la percezione che gli imprenditori non sono stati lasciati soli ad affrontare le difficoltà, ma hanno avuto una spalla sicura su cui poggiare i timidi, ma incoraggianti segnali di ripresa a cui abbiamo assistito in questi cinque anni, e messi a serio rischio negli ultimi mesi dall'emergenza Covid-19", ha aggiunto Fedalto.
 "Le sfide future per il nuovo Consiglio saranno quindi quelle di proseguire con azioni di supporto per garantire la piena ripartenza con interventi di accompagnamento capaci di affiancare il sistema produttivo nel ritrovare stabilità e rinnovata competitività con nuove prospettive di fiducia e sicurezza di lungo periodo”, ha continuato.
 Pù di 15 mila le imprese che sono state coinvolte in attività di formazione sui temi del digitale, internazionalizzazione, innovazione, sostenibilità ambientale, turismo e cultura, 165 nuove imprese e 60 start up sono nate o sono state avviate grazie al supporto dell'Ente. Oltre 300 mila le pratiche telematiche gestite, grazie a un' implementazione e potenziamento dei servizi per l'E-gov e il dialogo con la Pubblica Amministrazione. 4500 sono i ragazzi degli istituti superiori delle due province e 779 le imprese direttamente coinvolte in attività di orientamento al lavoro e alle professioni, 1,6 milioni sono le risorse investite nell'ultimo triennio di cui 1,2 milioni erogati sotto forma di voucher a rimborso delle spese di tutoraggio alle aziende che hanno ospitato ragazzi in alternanza scuola lavoro.
 In questi cinque anni i temi dell'innovazione e del digitale sono stati fondamentali nella programmazione delle attività e dei servizi dell'Ente, che ha aderito al network dei Pid - Punti Impresa Digitale, le strutture di servizio create dal sistema camerale, dedicate alla diffusione dell'innovazione e della digitalizzazione nelle Mpmi (Micro piccole medie imprese) in attuazione del Piano Nazionale Impresa 4.0. Circa 3 milioni le risorse investite nell'ultimo triennio in progetti per la crescita digitale delle Mpmi, di cui 1,4 milioni erogati sotto forma di voucher.
 Oltre 2 milioni di risorse sono state stanziate per la valorizzazione del patrimonio turistico, culturale e territoriale del tessuto economico di Venezia e Rovigo a favore di progetti condivisi con le istituzioni universitarie e gli organismi culturali di rilievo sul territorio. Sul fronte dell'internazionalizzazione la Camera si è impegnata nel sostegno di attività gestite attraverso le funzione associate e coordinate a livello interprovinciale da Veneto Promozione fino al 2016 e da Nuovo Centro Estero Veneto dal 2018 al 2020. Le attività dell'ufficio camerale si sono concentrate sulla campagna internazionale di promozione del portale degli esportatori ed importatori Venicexport e sulle certificazioni per l'estero con grande spinta alla digitalizzazione.
 Molto è stato fatto anche sul fronte della regolazione del mercato, sulla vigilanza prodotti con quasi 4000 controlli ispettivi e oltre 50 mila sequestri cautelativi di merce non conforme. Numerose le iniziative promosse sul fronte della legalità e della sostenibilità ambientale promosse con gli imprenditori e anche con le scuole delle due province, dal servizio ambiente della Camera di commercio, costituito dalla sezione del Veneto dell'albo gestori ambientali e dall'ufficio unico ambiente delle Camere di Commercio del Veneto.

Actor Mads Mikkelsen has broken his silence after getting the call to replace Jhonny Depp in _Fantastic Beasts 3_.
 Depp, who had appeared as the villain in the first two movies, made his exit from the franchise last month after losing his libel lawsuit against English publication _The Sun_.
 It __ had alleged that Depp was a "wife beater" towards ex-wife Amber Heard.
 While Depp shot only one scene of the film, he is still set to receive all of his eight-figure salary as per a clause in his contract.
 Speaking to _Entertainment Weekly,_ the _Hannibal_ star said that it was "tricky" to execute what Depp had over the previous films and added that he would try to maintain the character while "making it my own".
 "Well it’s going to be me, so that’s a difference," Mikkelsen said.
 "No, this is the tricky part. We’re still working it out. There has to be a bridge between what Johnny did and what I’m going to do. And at the same time, I also have to make it my own. But also we have to find a few links [to the previous version of the character] and some bridges so it doesn’t completely detach from what he’s already masterfully achieved."
 Regarding the movie itself, Mikkelsen expressed excitement over the new job but also extended his well wishes to Depp.
 "Job wise, it’s obviously super interesting and nice."
 "It’s also a shocker that it came after what happened, which is just super sad. I wish [Depp and Heard] the best. These are sad circumstances. I hope both of them will be back in the saddle again really soon."

 There are now more than 50 publicly-traded companies operating in the cannabis industry. Most of these companies aren't directly growing and selling marijuana themselves, but they do stand to benefit greatly as more states legalize the sale and possession of marijuana. Some of these marijuana stocks are media companies. Others are privately studying the medical uses of marijuana. Yet others are providing tools and software for marijuana growers. As more cannabis companies file IPOs and enter the stock market, it will become increasingly difficult for investors to identify which marijuana stocks will truly benefit from the cannabis boom.

ADRIAN -- A hearing to determine if a murder case should proceed to trial continued this week in Lenawee County District Court.
   
 Testimony in the case against James David Allan, 38, began Nov. 23. He is accused of killing his wife, Amy Allan, in 2018 at their home in Tecumseh, then trying to make her death appear to be from a suicide attempt by hanging. After a two-year investigation by Michigan State Police, the Lenawee County Prosecutor's Office authorized a charge of open murder against James Allan in October. He was arrested in Florida, where he had moved since Amy Allan's death.
   
 Witnesses in the preliminary examination have included a police officer and paramedic who responded to the rescue call on Sept. 14, 2018, a nurse working in ProMedica Herrick Hospital's emergency room that night, a materials testing expert who tested the strength of an extension cord alleged to have been used in the suicide attempt, forensic pathologist Dr. Bader Cassin and state police Detective Sgt. Larry Rothman. Rothman's testimony began Wednesday afternoon.
   
 Lenawee County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Angie Borders offered a hypothesis during Cassin's testimony Tuesday that Amy Allan was strangled from behind in a chokehold with an arm to the point of unconsciousness and then strangled from behind with an extension cord.
   
 Cassin is Lenawee County's medical examiner, but because Amy Allan died at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, the initial autopsy was conducted by the Washtenaw County chief medical examiner at the time, Dr. Jeffrey Jenzten. Cassin said in testimony Tuesday that he was asked within the past year to review the autopsy report, including photos, and prepare a report for the state police.
   
 Jentzen found that the cause of Amy Allan's death was asphyxiation and the manner of death was indeterminate pending further investigation, Cassin said. In his review of the autopsy materials, Cassin said Allan's injuries were not what he would expect from a self-inflicted hanging.
   
 Cassin said he found Amy Allan's manner of death difficult to determine.
   
 "I'm finding it difficult to say that there's any one injury that tells me for sure that this is a self-inflicted, ligature, hanging death versus a manufactured set of injuries along with perhaps what you suggest is a way of reducing her consciousness to none prior, because I don't find any evidence of her fighting against," he told the court while answering a question from Borders. "… I'm leaning toward the interpretation, if you put it all together, perhaps the weight is going toward the homicidal scenario versus the self- inflicted scenario."
   
 Allan's lead attorney, Daniel Geherin of Ann Arbor, asked Cassin if he had been the medical examiner in this case if he would have categorized Amy Allan's death a homicide.
   
 "That would be difficult, but I think I would, based on what I know now," Cassin said. "If I were the medical examiner, I might have more information. Based on what I know now with the information I've been thus given, I would say it's more likely that."
   
 Tecumseh police officer BJ Horn, assistant fire chief Scot Long, and emergency room nurse Daniel Myers testified last week that aspects of the scene and Amy Allan's injuries did not fit what they would expect from a hanging.
   
 Horn was the first to arrive, and he found James Allan performing CPR on his wife in the basement of their home on North Maumee Street.
   
 Horn and Long said the basement ceiling was low. Horn said James Allan told him the extension cord had been on a hook affixed to one of the exposed joists in the basement ceiling.
   
 "It did seem like the ceilings were low, and, in my opinion, her head would have had to have been near the top of the ceiling for her to hang … with her feet off the floor given any sort of tension or stretching of the cord or rope," Horn said.
   
 Horn said James Allan told him at the scene that he found Amy Allan hanging.
   
 Police body camera video from the scene was played in the courtroom. The images were not shown on the livestream, but the audio could be heard, and a distraught James Allan can be heard crying out about Amy Allan's condition. Horn described his emotions as "over the top."
   
 Long said the knot in the extension cord near Amy Allan's neck was not as tight as he would have expected from someone who had been found hanging. Long said he was able to easily remove the cord from around her neck and he could not find a pinch point in the cord like he would have expected from a hanging.
   
 The paramedics were able to reestablish a pulse, and when that was mentioned, Long said, he looked up at James Allan.
   
 "I just looked at him, and I'm expecting either tears or -- typically when we've done that in the past and we've mentioned that they have a pulse, it gives the family hope, and maybe I expected to see excitement or hope and it was more like fear," Long said.
   
 Long said he mentioned his feeling that he didn't think Amy Allan had hung herself to fellow firefighters and a police officer that night.
   
 Myers said along with his experience as an emergency room nurse he worked as a medical examiner investigator for the Lenawee County Medical Examiner's Office. Along with his concerns about Amy Adams' injuries not appearing to be from a hanging, he said, James Allan's behavior did not fit what he would expect from a relative in such a situation.
   
 "He just kind of seemed OK with the situation, which was strange to me considering what we were dealing with with her status and what kind of shape she was in," he said.
   
 Myers said he expressed his concerns to police.
   
 Elizabeth Buc, president of Fire and Materials Research Laboratory LLC in Livonia, testified about her tests on the extension cord. She is a chemist, materials engineer, licensed professional engineer and fire investigator.
   
 Buc testified that most test cords subjected to Amy Allan's weight had permanent elongation and the knot at the hook was tightened while the cord used in the alleged hanging did not have permanent elongation and the knot was not tight. She said three of the 10 test cords broke when subjected to the weight.

The Government is understood to remain committed to an election manifesto pledge to invest an additional £550million into grassroots football in England as part of a UK and Ireland bid for the 2030 World Cup.
 The pledge did not feature in the spending review set out by Chancellor Rishi Sunak last month, raising fears that a key plank of the bid, which has yet to be officially launched, would be a casualty of the coronavirus pandemic.
 However, Government sources say the intention to make the investment still stands. The £550m was a commitment over a 10-year period, which the Government said would represent a four-fold increase in investment.
 The Government’s multi-year spending review is expected to take place in the second half of 2021, with last month’s review very much an emergency package of measures to help various sectors of society cope with the financial impact of the pandemic.
 In announcing the additional investment in December last year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "If elected next week with a Conservative majority, I as Prime Minister will put my heart and soul behind the case for a UK and Ireland World Cup in 2030.
 "I want this tournament to be about more than just football. I want it to transform lives with a legacy to match the 2012 Olympics."
 The formal bidding process for the 2030 finals is set to begin in 2022, with a decision on the hosts for the centenary tournament to be taken in 2024.
 The Government investment was intended to improve grassroots provision in time as part of legacy for the 2030 finals and to ensure that every family in England would be, on average "15 minutes from a great local football pitch".
