A fountain pen, silver pocket watch and other prized possessions of the late Jewish-Polish composer Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life hero of the Oscar- winning film "The Pianist," go under the hammer in Warsaw next week.
 "This watch and pen that he bought on a trip to Paris in 1937 survived his whole stay in the Jewish ghetto, then kept him company in the ruins of Warsaw," said Szpilman's son Andrzej, who is organising the auction with his brother Krzysztof.
 The renowned musician, who died in 2000, came to the world's attention in Roman Polanski's film based on Szpilman's autobiography -- available in some 40 languages.
 The black Montblanc Meisterstuck pen, the pocket watch and a tie that is now part of the collection at the Polin Museum of the History of Polish Jews are the only Szpilman possessions to have survived the war.
 \- Sole survivor -
 Like every Jewish resident of the Polish capital, the pianist and his family were forced into the Warsaw Ghetto established by the Nazis in 1940. He made ends meet by playing the piano at whatever cafes remained open.
 In 1942, his relatives were sent to their deaths at the Treblinka extermination camp, but Szpilman was spared after a Jewish police officer recognised him from a concert and pulled him from the transport line at the last minute.
 Szpilman managed to escape the ghetto the following year, just before the Germans liquidated and abolished the Jewish district.
 He survived the rest of the war, thanks to the help of friends, by going from hideout to hideout, until he ended up at an empty apartment, totally cut off from the outside world.
 "The watch, an Omega, held special significance for my father," Andrzej Szpilman told AFP.
 "My father wrote that he would wind it up to know what time it was, because he lived in total solitude and had lost all sense of time.
 "The watch helped him put up with the passing time," the son said, before winding the watch and holding it up to his ear to hear it tick.
 \- The German officer -
 The item shows up in a touching passage of the autobiography.
 A German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, comes across Szpilman at his hideout but instead of killing him, he asks him to play the piano -- and gets Chopin. Later he helps Szpilman survive by bringing him food.
 "To thank him, near the end, my father wanted to offer him the watch as a token of his gratitude. The German took offence and refused," Andrzej Szpilman said.
 For having saved Wladyslaw Szpilman, among others, Hosenfeld was posthumously recognised as Righteous Among Nations, the Israeli title bestowed on those who helped Jews escape the Holocaust.
 \- 'Story of a whole people' -
 For Polin's chief curator Renata Piatkowska, the items up for auction not only tell "the story of his life, survival, miraculous rescue from the Holocaust" but also "the story of a whole people."
 "The items are also important because Szpilman selected them -- these little things of value -- because they could guarantee his survival," she told AFP.
 "He could sell them, pay off informers... These items had the potential to save his life."
 Another highlight of the collection to be put on sale Tuesday by the Desa Unicum auction house is the Steinway grand piano owned by Szpilman after the war.
 "As a museologist, I regret that this collection may end up scattered" around the world, Piatkowska said.
 "I really hope the pen and watch will be reunited with the tie in our collection and we'll be able to display the whole story."

It has been a great season for boating – and if you need a second opinion, head to a local marina and ask to see all the empty space in their showroom. Social distancing and travel restrictions made boating an attractive alternative to other summer plans, and lots of hot, dry weather made for a string of perfect boating weather that seemed to have no end in sight.
 That is, unless boaters were to look down, into the lake, because that summer of sunshine has left a lake much lower than usual. That’s leading some to suggest that people should pull their boats from the water and hope that next summer has its share of sunshine.
 “We would put out the warning to people, particularly if they aren’t year- round residents, they may want to look at their docking situations now,” said Tim Dunleavy, captain with the New Hampshire Marine Patrol. “If you wait too long, you may be employing a barge and a crane to get your boats off the bottom, or off the lift.”

That contrast is so beautiful to see,” she said. “What’s happening in the lower areas, the sumac and woodbine are changing. It is the perfect time to see the seasons changing. There are some trees that … are still very, very green. And then right in the middle of the tree is a pop of yellow. We are definitely not at the peak yet. There are some trees that have fully changed. But there are some that have little glimmers of what’s to come.”

“We've had a lot of close calls,” he said.
 Other tribes have sought to bolster their fire crews to do without the help of off-reservation teams. The Spokane Tribe earmarked some of the $19 million it received from the CARES Act to hire an additional 10-person seasonal crew. It hoped to aggressively attack any fire and keep it small, thereby avoiding the need for outside firefighters who might also bring in the coronavirus, Stearns said.
 The Yakama Nation, near Washington's border with Oregon, was still struggling with a coronavirus outbreak that had infected at least 6% of its population when fires started in July. The crews learned quickly that facing wildfire and a pandemic simultaneously would be an exercise in trade-offs.
 Early in the effort, five fire crew members were taken off the line when several people got sick, leaving the 20 remaining members to make do. Federal firefighting is stretched thin as megafires consume vast areas of the West Coast — and other tribes were no help because they’ve restricted their fire teams’ movement to prevent the coronavirus's spread.

“I would say it’s abnormally low, but I wouldn’t call it historically low,” Woodworth said. “It’s low enough to cause concern.”
 Winnipesaukee is about three to four inches below normal fall levels, but the historic low mark is another three inches lower.
 Boaters who decide to take their chances and get stuck therefore shouldn’t blame Woodworth’s maps, which he said are written “on average fall levels.”
 The conditions creating the low water have been in the works for almost a year, according to Paul Venuti, commander of the Lakes Region Sail and Power Squadron, a boating safety and advocacy organization.
 “This past winter, it was a real light winter for snow,” Venuti said. He has been a lakeside resident for 18 years, and has been coming up to boat on Winnipesaukee since 1985. His experience tells him that boaters should pack it up and be thankful for the season that was. He’s thinking about doing that himself, even though he usually keeps his boat in the water until Columbus Day.
 “I’ve considered pulling mine early, too,” Venuti said. “We’ve had a lot of wind and rain – showers, not beneficial rain – and a lot of wind this year, which makes for rough waters.
 “I feel there’s going to be a long, hard winter, a lot of early winter and hard winter conditions.” Venuti noted that good summers are usually followed by harsh winters, and it’s best to get boats put away before the conditions turn.
 “I think it’s going to be early, the sooner they get them out, the better for them, with the water being low now. That’s just my feeling, from what I’ve observed over the years,” Venuti said.
 Boating has always been a dance with nature, and the seasoned boater knows when the song is over.
 “What can we do about it? It’s Mother Nature,” said Dunleavy. “Sometimes Mother Nature doesn’t cooperate.”

Brazilian gymnast Angelo Assumpcao still wonders how far he could have gone if not for the decision he says derailed his career: speaking out against the racism he was subjected to by his white teammates.
 Could he have made the Olympics? Won a medal? At 24 years old, he may never get the chance to find out.
 "Some people think racism doesn't exist. I wonder where my career would be without it," he told AFP in an interview.
 Assumpcao's career was as short as it was promising.
 A muscular dynamo with an exuberant afro, he grew up on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, Brazil's economic capital, where he developed a love for gymnastics that soon landed him at the revered Pinheiros Sporting Club.
 Located in the upscale neighborhood from which it takes its name, Pinheiros is a veritable institution in Brazilian sport.
 Founded in 1899 -- just 10 years after Brazil became the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery -- it has trained some of the country's best athletes, including 12 Olympic medalists.
 Assumpcao came of age in its elite training academy, a lone black boy learning backflips and dismounts surrounded by white gymnasts.
 \- 'New sensation' -
 He got his big break in 2015, when he took the place of injured teammate Arthur Nory on the vault at the Gymnastics World Cup stage event in his hometown, Sao Paulo.
 Assumpcao won gold, upsetting Brazil's leading gymnast at the time, veteran Diego Hypolito, who won bronze.
 Globo Sports, part of Brazil's biggest media house, proclaimed Assumpcao "the new sensation" of Brazilian gymnastics.
 Days later, though, his celebration was cut short.
 Nory put a video on social media in which he and two other young white gymnasts cracked racist jokes with a visibly uncomfortable Assumpcao.
 "When your cell phone's working, the screen is white. When it breaks, what color is it?" a snickering Nory asks in the video.
 "Black!" comes the answer.
 "The plastic bags at the supermarket are white. What color are garbage bags?"
 The video went viral online, triggering outrage in Brazil, a country of 212 million people where 54 percent of the population is black or mixed race.
 The Brazilian Gymnastics Federation suspended the three white gymnasts for a month. They later apologized.
 But Assumpcao says it was not an isolated incident.
 He was regularly mocked for his skin color, hair and Afro-Brazilian heritage, he says.
 He pinpoints his decision to speak out against such behavior as the moment his career started to unravel.
 He was not selected for the 2016 Olympics, held in Brazil's second city, Rio de Janeiro. Hypolito and Nory were, taking home medals -- silver and bronze, respectively, in the floor competition.
 Assumpcao says he sank into depression because of the discrimination he faced.
 At first, he kept his complaints behind closed doors, going to Pinheiros directors in private because he feared reprisals, he said.
 When he felt the club failed to listen, he went public about the "structural racism" he says prevails there.
 \- Training at home -
 In November 2019, Pinheiros rescinded his contract, saying he was under- performing.
 Assumpcao says it was punishment for condemning racism in the gymnastics world.
 "You pay a very heavy price when you're a victim of racism in Brazil, or anywhere in the world," he said.
 "But the oppressors pay a much cheaper price. Look at Arthur Nory. He got to go on with his life."
 Last year, Pinheiros carried out an internal review that confirmed incidents of "racial abuse" and "harassment" at the club, according to a report by Globo Sports.
 However, in a statement to AFP, the club denied racism in the decision to cut ties with Assumpcao.
 His bitter experiences rushed back recently when another Brazilian, Neymar, accused a defender of using racist insults against him during Paris Saint- Germain's 1-0 loss to Marseille Sunday.
 "That just goes to show that you can be the best athlete in the world, rich and famous, but they still judge you by the color of your skin," said Assumpcao.
 Today, the gymnast trains by himself at home, getting by with the help of donations from friends and family and hoping to get the chance to compete again.
