I’ve always said that a Democratic vote in rural Wise County counts just as much as a vote in suburban Fairfax County. As our election results are finalized and pundits start to draw lessons from the vote totals, it’s important for Democrats to take stock of our efforts to turn out rural voters in the same way we assess our tactics in other areas of the commonwealth. Our party has been successful over the past several years because we’ve expanded the map and haven’t taken any votes for granted. As Democrats we’ve made significant inroads in small towns and rural areas, and it’s crucial we keep up that effort over the next four years.
 This year Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won Arizona and Georgia, states that Democrats haven’t won in decades. And in Virginia, Biden flipped localities across the commonwealth that have been traditionally red. Virginia Beach, Chesapeake and Chesterfield County were all once Republican strongholds that went blue this year, and winning them is a big reason why Biden had the largest presidential margin of victory for a Democrat in Virginia since FDR. Biden also flipped Lynchburg, the home of Liberty University, which hadn’t gone blue since the 1940s.

Then it traveled to Wuhan unnoticed, where it was first detected, DailyMail reported.
