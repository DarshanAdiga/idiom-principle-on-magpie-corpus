This Amazon production, which premieres as a stream on March 20, is a nicely constructed, low-budget thriller that features many layers that its writing- directing partners Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy manage to keep on an even, slowly unfolding keel. Not surprisingly, it opens in song, on an ocean pier, with a fisherman, accompanied by three other fishermen, belting out the title song.      But why they're singing it, and why the film takes its name from it, is and will remain a bigger mystery than the multiple mysteries that move the film along.      The location is the fictional Easter Cove, Maine, where two women, Pris (Sophie Lowe) and her younger sister Mary Beth (Morgan Saylor) - they're known in town as the Connolly girls - are sharing a drink before attending the funeral of their mother.      Though this appears to be the beginnings of a character study on the differences between the siblings - they're close, but Pris is the responsible one, Mary Beth is the wild child - it soon heads off into all sorts of directions, with many other people.      Post-funeral, Mary Beth heads for the local bar for a few drinks, but has some trouble with local bad apple Gorski (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who comes on to her, won't let up and - since this happens so early in the film, I'll give it away - is killed by her in self-defense, with a harpoon assist.      Uh-oh, this is not the kind of thing you want to be caught up in in a small town. Good thing steady-nerved Pris is around to figure out what to do, to put a plan in motion to get rid of the body. But this proves to be no easy feat, and in one of the film's best darkly humorous lines of dialogue, as they're trying to stuff him in a cooler, a shaken Mary Beth says, "What are we supposed to do, Pris? Chop his arms off?"      Well, yeah! And that very sharp knife with the Connolly fishing business name emblazoned on it should do the trick. And the endless ocean would be a great place to dump the cooler.      Time to meet more people. There's Enid (Margo Martindale), who runs the Ocean View B&B; (which really should be called a B&B;&B; because it's also a brothel). And there's a trio of longtime residents - Susie, Gail, and Doreen (June Squibb, Annette O'Toole, Marceline Hugot) who seem to know everything about everyone. And there are a couple of cops - one is a regular customer at the B&B;&B;, the other is an inquisitive man just doing his job.      Before you can catch a breath, a body washes up onshore, and when the sisters find out, they panic. But it turns out to be a bullet-riddled woman (no harpoon marks!) who worked at the B&B;&B;, and she wasn't exactly preparing breakfasts or making beds. Look out! Nasty, foul-mouthed working woman Lexie (Gayle Rankin) is soon making things even murkier.      By the time the expanding series of plotlines introduces a bag with $50,000 cash, and the Connolly knife has gone missing, you're wondering where else this story can possibly turn. Some sleepy little town!      The film is about all of these people and incidents, but the focus eventually comes around to Enid, and Martindale gives a frightening, multi-textured performance as a powerful woman who's juggling a lot of secrets.      There are questions everywhere you turn, and just about all of them are answered. But the writers-directors couldn't quite lick the problem of how to end it, and in an attempt to wrap things up, those answers are delivered too quickly, too neatly. And I'm still wondering why the film is called "Blow the Man Down."      "Blow the Man Down" premieres on Amazon on March 20.      Ed Symkus writes about movies for More Content Now.

The Green Bay Packers have signed Christian Kirksey to a two-year, $16 million contract, per his agency, Sportstars. Kirksey, who was released by the Cleveland Browns last week, was free to sign with any team prior to the free agent signing period.
 Kirksey, 27, was a third-round draft choice out of Iowa in 2014. He did not miss a regular-season game during his first four seasons, finishing with 484 tackles, 11.5 sacks, two interceptions, four forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries. He was the Browns recipient of the 2018 Walter Payton Man of the Year award.
 Kirksey will be reunited with Mike Pettine, who was his former head coach with the Browns (2014 and 2015) and is currently the defensive coordinator of the Packers. In his two seasons under Pettine, Kirksey had 144 tackles, 5.5 sacks and two forced fumbles (13 starts).

First, in researching the financial crisis, we found the 2011 10-K shows AHT curtailed capex by 50% in 2009 and 2010, when the lodging market returned to full health. So let us propose 2020 capex of $100 million to be conservative. Next, AHT announced that with its variable debt, it enjoys $19 million in interest savings for every 50 bps decline in interest rates. The Fed just cut 50 bps and then another 100bps. That means $57 million in additional cash flow this year.
 So we’ve gone from -$15 million in CAD to $102 million. We now should reduce this amount assuming a drastic decline in FFO from lack of travel. Again looking to the financial crisis, AHT experienced a 20% decline in hotel revenue between 2008 and 2009 – but also cut operating expenses by 14%.
 Let’s say FFO gets cut to $45 million, leaving CAD at $57 million, leaving AHT about $22 million short of the $79 million needed for all dividend payments.
 AHT has $276 million of cash on hand. The dividends are easily covered.So with the $1 stock price, AHT should be trading closer to its $2.79 net asset value.
 ## Preferred Shares Have 3x Upside
 However, also intriguing are the preferred shares AHT has. There are several issuances here, and all are vastly below par.
 The market is behaving exactly as it did in 2009, when Ashford was the only hotel REIT that did not suspend its preferred dividends. The preferred stocks fell to $4.50 per share and eventually returned to their par value of $25 and beyond. On Thursday, the Preferred Series F, G, H, and I closed at $7.96, $7.38, $7.93, and $7.57, respectively. These are ludicrous prices with more than 3x upside to reach par value, and yielding upwards of 18% on each - and an apparently sustainable yield at that.

The Welwyn Garden City youngster had been out for four months with an ankle injury but finally made his comeback in two U18 games.
 The first, at Colney Heath, was abandoned at half-time but he played from the start in a 7-0 win over Hoddesdon Town just before his 18th birthday, scoring one and picking up two assists.
 And the joy at being back comes partly from both the mental and physical challenges he has had to go through.
 “It was so good,” he said with a huge smile. “Just getting the boots on and knowing I was going back on the pitch.
 “I just need baby steps and to gradually progress with the U18s and get my feet back.
 “It’s been a hard four months but it’s been a process, what with the rehab and slowly building the strength up again.
 “It’s always been leading to this moment and I now need to keep myself 100 per cent fit and injury free.
 “It’s been tough mentally too as I was out for four months last year too.
 “It’s been challenging but I’ve kept my head up knowing I can come back stronger.
 “I’ve just got to make sure I get my fitness up now and make sure I’m in the best shape I’ve ever been and hopefully I get back to scoring goals.
 “It’s all just a part of growing up as a footballer and progressing.”
 And while the plan was to have run-outs for the U18s, Carrington is not ruling out fighting for a first-team place, if football returns quickly.
 “I’m going to push for it,” he said. “I’ll never say never but it’s all about what Nick [Ironton] thinks.
 “If I can impress him like I did at the start of the year then I can end the season well.
 “If not I’ll be ready to hit the ground running next season and become a regular.”
 In his absence WGC have climbed into the play-off places in the Southern League Division One Central and even if their two matches before the league’s half ended in defeat, Carrington believes they are exactly where they deserve to be.
 He said: ““There have been a lot of ups and downs over the four months.
 “Sometimes you watch and we look a good team but Daventry was a shocker and North Leigh wasn’t the best either.
 “It’s been good supporting them though. It’s my hometown club so I enjoy that as it is.
 “They are a good bunch of lads and they deserve to be winning every week.”

The Green Bay Packers continue their free agent shopping spree, signing right tackle Rick Wagner to a two-year contract. Per Aaron Wilson of the Houston Chronicle, Wagner will make $11 million over the two-year contract with $2.25 million in base salaries each year, plus a $1 million roster bonus if he's on the team on the third day of the 2021 league year. Wagner will also get a $250,000 workout bonus which can go up to $750,000. He also has a $2.75 million playtime base escalator in 2021.
 Wagner had been with Detroit since the 2017 season. He played the first four years of his career with the Baltimore Ravens before signing a five-year, $47.5 million contract that included $17.5 million guaranteed with the Detroit Lions. He started all 40 games played with the Lions.
 Signing Wagner indicates the Packers will be moving on from longtime right tackle Bryan Bulaga, who started 111 of 115 games in his 10 seasons with the Packers. Bulaga, who will be 31 this week, was a first-round pick of the Packers in 2010.
 This is the latest free agent splash signing by the Packers over the past few seasons. Green Bay landed Za'Darius Smith, Preston Smith and Adrian Amos during the first wave of free agency last offseason. Green Bay agreed to a two-year deal with Christian Kirksey earlier Monday and now signed Wagner to a two-year contract.

There's a silver lining in the economic anxiety Americans face: Interest rates are at unprecedented lows and benchmark bond yields have dropped below 1% for the first time in history, conditions that are expected to cut borrowing costs even further on everything from mortgages to student loans.
 The Federal Reserve lowered borrowing costs to near zero Sunday in an emergency move to combat the economic shocks from the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield, a key benchmark that influences borrowing costs on houses and auto loans, slumped further to historic lows this month as virus fueled worries stoked fears of an economic slowdown.
 But experts say borrowers are poised to benefit from the combination of lower rates and a drop in bond yields in the coming months.
 Mortgages
 Mortgage rates have dropped to historical lows as bond yields have fallen, a move that could help first-time homebuyers and those looking to refinance. When Treasury yields fall, banks charge lower interest rates for mortgages.
 The Fed's key short-term rate affects 30-year mortgages and other long-term rates indirectly. The average fixed rate for a 30-year mortgage rose to 3.36% last week, up slightly from an all-time low of 3.29% the prior week, according to Freddie Mac. That's almost a full percentage point lower than 4.31% a year ago.
 "This is the time to refinance," says Julia Carlson, founder and CEO of Financial Freedom Wealth Management Group.
 Student loans
 A drop in yields can also affect the interest rates on student loans. For Americans who are headed to college next fall and weighing their financial aid offers, it's important to separate scholarships from loans that have to be paid back, experts caution.
 "Once you take out a federal student loan, the interest rate is fixed for life," says Robert Humann, general manager at Credible, an online loan marketplace. "But many families don't realize that you'll have different interest rates on the loans that you take out each year you're in school, which can make it hard to get a handle on what your monthly payment and total repayment costs will be."
 If the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell all the way to zero, new loans to undergraduates would be 2.05%, graduate students would pay 3.6%, and the rate on parent PLUS and grad PLUS loans would be 4.6%, according to Humann.
 On Friday, the 10-year Treasury yield settled at 0.946% after falling as low as an all-time low of 0.318% earlier this month. As long as it stays below 2.48% on May 12 -- last year's benchmark -- rates on federal student loans taken out for the 2020-21 academic year will go down on July 1, Humann said.
 Credit cards
 Credit card holders probably won't immediately feel the impact of the Fed's latest move to bring rates down to zero because these rate reductions tend to be passed along within a couple of billing cycles, experts say.
 For someone with $6,000 in credit card debt, Sunday's move alone can end up saving them a little less than $200 in interest, according to Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards.
 "While this is certainly welcome news for those with card debt, other moves would be far more helpful for those struggling with cash flow in the wake of the coronavirus," Schulz said. "Perhaps the best thing banks could do is allow cardholders to miss a payment or two during this time of crisis without fear of late fees, credit damage or interest accruing. That would be a really big deal."

ATLANTA, Ga. (CBS46) An Atlanta man will spend the rest of his life behind bars after he was convicted of a fatal shooting during a bank fraud heist gone wrong.
 In 2018, Brejon Nabors, 29, and Mondavius Milan, 32, were partners in a bank fraud scheme where they would deposit fraudulent checks and money orders and then withdraw the funds before the bank reversed the transaction.
 On April 3, 2018, Nabors, Milan and two other men drove to the bank to withdraw the funds and at some point, Nabors accused of Milan of stealing money from him. Nabors then drew a gun and a struggle ensued. The fight spilled out of the vehicle and Nabors eventually shot Milan in the stomach before taking off on foot.
 Milan also ran from the scene but eventually died in the middle of Campbellton Road in Atlanta. Nabors dumped his phone and fled to New Bedford, Massachusetts, making Atlanta's Most Wanted List in the process.

 Las Vegas has already taken the precaution of closing casinos and other public outlets, which no doubt prompted the NFL to make their final decision on public fan events. The NFL has the benefit of its regular season not occurring until September, but the impact of COVID-19 is being felt everywhere. How much more it'll impact the league's offseason is anyone's guess, but free agency, the new league year and the draft dates all remain unchanged for now.
 Teams from around the league have voiced concerns over the NFL's decision to mostly move forward in a business as usual tone during such a trying time, but their cries for a sweeping pause have mostly gone unnoticed.

But what we're more likely to understand then is the - really, the presentation and the diagnosis of the disease, where are we seeing these patients most likely get misdiagnosis, where are they misdiagnosis? What are they getting misdiagnosed with? And then ultimately, the ones that are correctly diagnosed with BPDCN, where are they presenting and hopefully where they're getting treated? And all of these insights, I believe, are going to be pretty close at hand once this - once these latest analyses bear fruit. But we'll have a pretty decent projection and understanding of that in short term, but not quite yet ready to give any answers there.

Yeah, I think it's pretty much the consistent story that we've relayed in the past that what we see is in this disease state, certainly with the small end that we're finding is that the patients are presenting or getting diagnosed and transitioning to ELZONRIS starts with really no rhyme or reasons. It's that traditional choppiness that we've characterized quite well over the past many, many months.

I had just broken up with my girlfriend (or maybe she’d broken up with me) and there I was, out on the field, barking the snap count and trying to read coverages. Between every play, I would glance up in the stands and try to spot my ex. Somewhere around the end of the first quarter, I found her, sitting next to some dude I didn’t know.
 As you can probably guess, the rest of the game wasn’t pretty. My brain was fried, my heart broken, and my passes, well, let’s just say they were “off the mark.” Looking back, I know I let my team down. I wasn’t focused like I needed to be, and we lost because of it.
 A few years later, I signed a contract to play quarterback for a team in France after winning the equivalent of the Super Bowl in Sweden. I was single and as focused as I’d ever been, but then I met another girl.
 One date led to another, and about a month before I was set to fly to Cannes. I backed out of my contract and decided to become a high school football coach. Nine months later, I was married to Mallory, my wife of seven years.
 I tell both of these stories to point out the subjectivity of both football and young love. There’s no way to tell whether your son’s new girlfriend will be his future wife or the reason his high school team loses in the second round of the playoffs.
 I do think you should talk to him about it, though. Sit him down and speak from the heart. Tell him about the times when you were blinded by passion and what it cost you. But also tell him how you met his mother. Make sure he understands the power of true love.
 If you don’t have any crazy stories — no fourth-and-long tales or French connections — maybe you could share this column with him. Lord knows I’ll share it with my son one day, and you can bet I’ll pass it along to my daughter too.

Well, CNBC contributor Josh Brown thinks Trump may have had his own "mission accomplished" moment last Friday when he autographed a chart showing the stock market's major rally amid the coronavirus pandemic. Brown thinks it's "pretty much the same thing" as Bush's speech, suggesting the U.S. — and the stock market (which plunged again) — are far from out of the woods, despite the president's optimism.

We should note that the company carries notes within its capital structure that offer coupons from 1.8% to 3.8%, all of which with an investment-grade BBB+ rating. All bonds are trading well above par, indicating that the credit market has no concerns with corporate liquidity. We would consider Welltower to have a strong capital structure, though they may consider cutting the dividend to right-size the payout ratio.
 ## Conclusion
 Shares in senior home REITs have experienced a dramatic decline since the outset of COVID-19 in the United States. The risks to entire housing having to undergo quarantine are real. As a result, sell-side analysts have made a number of target price revisions (lower) in the past week. While we understand the risks to Welltower in the near-term, there may be an opportunity to acquire shares of this well-operated senior home REIT in the coming weeks, once we have a little more information. We also want to listen carefully to how management talks about the level of visibility they have regarding FY20 occupancy rates. In addition, management will likely comment on their dividend policy given the high payout ratio. REITs, along with utilities, are typically considered defensive during market downturns. They provide strong dividend streams and benefit from low-interest-rate environments. The events of the past week are nearly unprecedented in terms of a viral pandemic induced broad market sell-off. Widespread outbreaks in elderly residential units is a risk. However, when the outbreak ceases, we expect an opportunity to own a high- quality REIT with strong demographic drivers at a low valuation.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is alleging that a foreign disinformation campaign is underway aimed at spreading fear in the country amid the coronavirus pandemic, three U.S. officials said Monday. On Sunday, federal officials began confronting what they said was a deliberate effort by a foreign entity to sow fears of a nationwide quarantine amid the virus outbreak. Agencies took coordinated action Sunday evening to deny that any such plans were put in place, as they tried to calm a nation already on edge by disruptions to daily life caused by the virus. The three U.S. officials did not name the foreign entity they believe to be responsible. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. “Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE,” tweeted the National Security Council Sunday night. “There is no national lockdown.” The NSC encouraged Americans to follow official government guidance. States and municipalities have banned large public gatherings, closed schools, bars and restaurants, and advised people to exercise so-called social distancing to slow the spread of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday issued new guidance recommending against indoor gatherings larger than 50 people for the next eight weeks. The nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said Sunday that Americans should aim to severely curtail leaving their homes, but did not indicate the government would order such a move. He was specifically questioned on whether he'd like to see a “national lockdown.” \"I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,\" said Fauci, a member of the White House task force on...
