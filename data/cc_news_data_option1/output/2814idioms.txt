Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to this question. Depending on your sensibilities, you could answer the “why” question with: bad luck, an act of God, or S&%# happens! But, ultimately, any answer that you come up with will be largely unsatisfying and may even cause more consternation and frustration.

The report, obtained by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit newsroom, outlines specific measures for counties in the red zone. It encourages residents to "wear a mask at all times outside the home and maintain physical distance." It also recommends officials "close bars and gyms" and "limit social gatherings to 10 people or fewer," which would mean rolling back reopening provisions in these places.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that he hoped spectators would be able to return to stadiums from the middle of October. Mr Johnson said that changes "must be done in a Covid-secure way, subject to the successful outcome of pilots". Canaries Trust chairman Robin Sainty said he was happy and "not particularly surprised" to hear the news, but stressed that the safety of supporters at Carrow Road has to be the priority. "I'm happy, if we can get the fans back into the stadium safely. I don't care whether that's August, September or next January - the key thing is it's got to be safe. "There is going to have to be an awful lot of work put in in terms of health and safety, to deal with the pinch points - the areas where people do crowd together like queuing for food and toilets at half time and getting into the turnstiles." Norwich City head coach Daniel Farke said he would like to see fans back "sooner rather than later", but also reiterated the importance of supporters' health. "We play football for the supporters and with the supporters. It's a strange feeling behind closed doors to not be allowed to celebrate or feel the pain with them. "Of course we're all looking forward to have them back as soon as possible and sooner rather than later, but I think it's also important to listen to the experts because the protocols were pretty strict and worked quite well and I think we still have to be careful - but we leave it with the experts." In a statement The FA said it would "continue to work closely with the relevant authorities" as it welcomed the Government's update. Questions remain over how fans returning to Carrow Road would work in terms of ticketing, but Mr Sainty believes that a ballot is the "only fair way" to decide who can attend games with a reduced capacity. "I don't see how they could get close to another system that everyone would be happy with. Drawing lots has no element of choice in it, it's pure chance, and that's the fairest way forward. "The minute you get any element of selection you're opening a massive can of worms."

“On average we have been carrying around 10pc of customers to what would normally be travelling, but over the last few weeks demand has started to increase and we have improved some frequencies and added more buses back into the bus network.
 “We still have a long way to go before we get back to some sort of normality but it is encouraging to see people having the confidence to get back to using our services.”
 On the trains, Greater Anglia encourage customers to buy tickets in advance or use contactless.
 The train operator is now running full services on all local routes, as well as more Norwich to London intercity services.
 A Greater Anglia spokesperson said: “We’re fully focused on providing a convenient and safe service for customers, as more people start to take the train again.
 “Passengers are encouraged to stay safe while travelling this summer and should wear a mask, wash their hands or use hand sanitiser.
 “We’ve also introduced a wide range of measures to make it easier for customers to observe social distancing at stations - including floor markings, one-way systems, new signs and queuing systems.”

As with most crises, COVID-19 will pass, and life in the triathlon world and beyond will return to normal. The expanded prep period of conditioning, sport training, and, of course, mental training forced on us by the pandemic can occupy your minds, lift our spirits, and actually make us better triathletes (and people) in the long run. And then, hopefully, upcoming races will happen or next season will arrive. And life in the triathlon world will once again return to its usual intense, inspiring, and fun pace. And we’ll look back on this crisis as a bump (admittedly, a pretty big bump) and then look forward to another great and fun and exciting season ahead.
