The two-week filing period for most federal, state and local elected offices starts Tuesday.


  Cities and school districts in both Monticello and Big Lake are set to open the candidate filing period soon. Some area townships will be electing officials this Fall, as well.


  In Monticello, there will be two new representatives on the Monticello City Council.


  Mayor Brian Stumpf is not seeking re-election, nor is Councilmember Bill Fair.


  Those two seats, as well as the council seat held by incumbent Jim Davidson, will be on the ballot come Nov. 3.


  There are also three seats open on the Monticello School Board.


  The terms of School Board Chair Jill Hoffman, Jeff Hegle and Missy Hanson are expiring on Dec. 31. The three seats will be on the November ballot.


  In Big Lake, there will be a lot of activity when it comes to the city government election, with the mayoral seat and the seats of three council members expiring at the end of the year.

Mary thought the Mayor just wanted to be remembered fondly. It didn’t seem like too much on paper, but sitting at the battle-scarred table of Unnamed Bar #2 (the actual name of the bar, according to paperwork Mary had found while filing the deed for her tack shop/smuggling emporium), Mary could see what drove the Mayor to drink. Every other pioneer had blown past him on the way to the future, leaving him with the curse of being first, but not best. The Mayor floated on a flimsy raft of forgotten accomplishments, amid oceans of amnesia.

U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Southfield, will face a second primary challenge from Terrance Morrison in Michigan’s heavily Democratic-voting 14th Congressional District.
 Lawrence easily shrugged off Morrison, a retired Detroit public works official, when he sought to secure the Democratic nomination in 2016. Morrison lost by 79 percentage points but is mounting a second attempt, while Lawrence seeks reelection to a fourth term representing the district for two years.
 The 14th Congressional District contains portions of Wayne and Oakland counties, including a portion of Detroit. It is among the most Democratic- voting districts in Michigan; according to Cook Political Report’s Partisan Voting Index, the 14th District trends +30 points for Democrats.
 Lawrence served as the mayor of Southfield for 13 years before joining the U.S. House in 2014. She was re-elected to a third term in 2018 and did not face a Democratic primary challenger that year.
 Morrison was born and raised on the east side of Detroit. He is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, entrepreneur and minister. In 1981, Morrison was convicted of two felonies -- assault with intent to murder and a felony weapons charge -- and was sentenced to prison.
 Morrison describes himself as a pro-life and pledged to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood. in statements posted to social media. He also references his past conviction in a statement posted to his campaign’s Facebook page.
 “Since then, I have never reoffended, maintained steady employment, became a business owner and traveled extensively to Africa, the Caribbean’s and South America,” Morrison writes.
 Lawrence has a sizable financial advantage against Morrison. The incumbent Democrat had $860,962 to spend on her reelection campaign at the end of June, according to the most recent financial statements available. Morrison did not file quarterly statements in 2020 but had raised $1,000 by the end of 2019.
 Voters in the 14th Congressional District are also able to cast a ballot for one of two Republicans seeking their party’s nomination to compete in the November general election.
 This year, MLive Media Group partnered with the League of Women Voters of Michigan to provide candidate information for readers. Each candidate was asked to outline their stances on a variety of public policy issues.
 Information on all state and federal races and many of Michigan’s county and local races will be available at Vote411.org, an online voter guide created by the League of Women Voters.

Trying to impact the forward price curve for oil sounds like a massive undertaking, but there are a few ways to achieve it, and these are very similar to the current OPEC strategy. The first is to shorten the cadence of market decisions to provide more precise control. This is what we now see with OPEC making monthly decisions, compared to historical decisions at six month or yearly intervals. It would then be important to tighten up the spot market by keeping some level of cuts in place, but consistently remind the market that there is significant spare capacity that could be brought back online in the future. This reminder would put downward pressure on the back of the curve and keep future prices lower. The effect would hopefully be that the low future price kept supply constrained but with less financial impact for OPEC as production is sold into a higher near-term market. Across the world people are saying that COVID is a chance to improve on historical practices, and OPEC’s approach to the oil markets is likely no different.

And Mark, this is Mark Gim, I'll take that question. The net inflows were driven by a combination of high net worth individuals and by one larger institutional account at the end of the quarter, which came in from the private clients group. These are by and large from new clients, although there are always additions from existing clients, and we're optimistic that that momentum will continue into Q3. Although, as you can imagine, business development in the COVID era has been a little bit more challenging. So, pipelines were strong going into the end of the second quarter. We're working to refill those going into the third, but I think we can safely say that the majority of net asset inflows were due to new customers.

They aren’t the first, and they surely won’t be the last.
 But athletic departments in Vermont colleges have started to break the news over the last couple weeks to their athletes, alumni, and fans that there will not be any competition for fall sports -- or even through the entire fall semester.
 The announcements are consistent with those from a slew of other institutions of higher education throughout the country over the last month in light of safety concerns for collegiate participants, staff, and spectators surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.
 Clear distinctions between “postponements” and “cancellations” were emphasized in some of the statements issued by conferences or individual colleges -- noting that there is the likelihood that those sports that are traditionally played during the fall semester will instead be facilitated in the spring if circumstances permit.
 The Board of Presidents for NCAA Division I’s America East Conference -- of which the University of Vermont is a member -- made the announcement on July 17 that all fall sports would be postponed. In a follow-up message posted online, Director of Athletics Jeff Shulman said a decision about winter sports -- which includes men’s and women’s basketball and ice hockey -- and playing the fall sports in the spring would be made at a later date.
 On July 16, NCAA Division II’s Northeast-10 Conference made an announcement which impacts the whole semester and member institution Saint Michael’s College (SMC). Its Council of Presidents chose to suspend all league- sanctioned competition and championships through December 31 -- not only postponing fall sports but causing its winter sports to have a delayed start to their seasons.
 Norwich University’s (NU) league, the Great Northeast Athletic Conference, announced July 20 that it would be postponing fall sports, but the Northfield, Vt. institution jumped ahead and released a message from President Col. Mark C. Anarumo on July 15 saying that NU “will not be participating in fall sports this year.”
 Castleton University primarily participates in the Little East Conference. As of press time, neither the Little East nor Castleton had announced a decision regarding fall sports or the fall semester. However, the Eastern Collegiate Football Conference -- in which the Spartans play for that individual sport -- posted an update on its website July 14 saying that it would not be sponsoring a 2020 conference season. Schools are still permitted to make their own decisions whether or not to play scheduled games against league or non-league opponents.
 Middlebury College was one of the first to see the fate of its fall determined as its New England Small College Athletics Conference cancelled its fall sports seasons this year on July 10. Individual institutions, however, were given the discretion to organize practices and alternative competition dependent on state and local health guidelines.
 The North Atlantic Conference -- which both Northern Vermont University Johnson and Lyndon’s athletic departments are members of -- announced on July 20 that fall sports would not be sanctioned by the league. As of this story’s deadline, Vermont Technical College had not released any update about this upcoming semester.
 With these decisions arise an abundance of questions pertaining to student- athletes’ athletic eligibility, athletics aid and scholarships and potential involvement in team-facilitated functions and gatherings.
 The NE10 posted an extensive list of frequently asked questions -- one of the answers saying that St. Michael’s and the rest of its members will honor its athletics aid agreements issued to student-athletes for the 2020-21 academic year “in accordance to the terms and conditions laid out in those agreements.” It also says that, under NCAA rules, if a student-athlete is not to participate in outside competition -- that being against another institution -- they will not lose a year of athletic eligibility.
 Many colleges are preparing to have their fall athletes keep busy and involved with their respective sport, if they would like, in more than a club or intramural basis.
 “Though competition will not be possible this fall, we plan to provide meaningful practice and skill development opportunities for our teams, as well as robust strength and conditioning programming,” said SMC Director of Athletics Chris Kenny in a letter sent to St. Michael’s student-athletes on the 16th.
 Kenny said in a Monday call with Messenger staff that he does not expect to have any layoffs with staff and that he hasn’t heard of student-athletes who were intending to go to SMC instead decide to take classes online or at a community college.
 “In these uncertain times, I think that students are considering a wide range of options,” he said. “Obviously, our hope is that we get our students here and get them involved in our programming and our campus community. The academic experience on campus is first and foremost of paramount importance.”
 He also said that he doesn’t mind the potential logistical hassle the college might run into with combining fall and spring sports at the same time during the second semester.
 “It’s a problem that we would love to have,” said Kenny.

Price convinced Rhodes to record them in the garage with the help from a few guest musicians. The resulting album, 2016’s “Rainbow Ends,” was a mature mix of songwriting that stands with his original trilogy of albums. Wilco guitarist Nels Cline and studio wiz Jon Brion contributed guitar solos; Susanna Hoffs and Aimee Mann provided backing vocals. It would be Rhodes’ last musical statement. After the album’s release, he scrapped all planned public performances including an appearance at South by Southwest. He was proud of his work but unwilling to travel too far from home, a creature of habit and a victim of his own debilitating insecurity.


  Rhodes never left the California suburbs. He relinquished the spotlight to his shaggier contemporaries in the canyons and lived fairly anonymously in the same house for 65 years. “He was ahead of everybody,” says Price. “He could take what was around him and make it great and something that you couldn’t distinguish from a big studio production. He was a great songwriter and singer but more than anything, what he has contributed to recording culture is invaluable.”


  Rhodes is survived by his two sons, Forrest and Ethan, and a daughter, Thea.

This is Mark. Just to amplify on Ron's comments, we have several different billing conventions; some are based on asset under management spot balance at the end of a given month, some are based on average daily balance, and some are based on billing in arrears. So, wealth management, AUM-related fees tend to lag on the way up in a rising market and tend to lag about a quarter on the way down in a falling market, but I think Ron's comments at the beginning of the call were spot on. If you look at the average monthly balance during the quarter of wealth AUM, the fee declined roughly, follow that.

Thank you very much. Coming back to the Oulu startup, which is due to commence late in the fourth quarter. I wonder if you could just discuss with us briefly on the financial impact that we should be expecting. I presume, Oulu, for the time being is loss-making, that will presumably change, but also you might incur some extra costs in conjunction with the ramp-up and during the initial phase of line of production you might be loss-making. So any information that you might want to share there would be helpful. Thank you.

Ricketts said he too encourages people to wear masks — it’s one of several practical steps, along with hand-washing and social distancing, that can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But the current trend of coronavirus cases and hospitalization rates in the Lincoln area doesn’t support the need for a government-issued mandate, he said.
 Ricketts was one of only a few governors who did not issue a formal, statewide stay-at-home order when the pandemic started, but many residents voluntarily did that anyway, he said, because Nebraskans are “community-minded people.”
 “We have managed through the peak of our cases and the peak of our hospitalizations without having a mask mandate,” he said. “Why do we need one now? We’ve been able to manage this by asking people to do the right thing.”
 “We should continue to educate, we should continue to communicate the importance of wearing a mask, but to bring the heavy hand of the government in and tell people what to do — that to me just seems overbearing,” said Ricketts, who was speaking at a press conference on the state’s Medicaid expansion.
 Local hospitals have plenty of open beds and are not overwhelmed, Ricketts said. Monday, the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department reported that 21 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized — 15 from Lancaster County and six from other communities.

The IAF has already positioned almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the LAC, a move that came against the backdrop of the border row with China. Diplomatic and military talks between China and India are continuing for complete disengagement of troops from a number of friction points in eastern Ladakh.

It all began with the voice. When she was preparing for the audition, Grant says she turned to “Mother Google” for research on vocal fry, a trait often derided in young women. And what she learned — that women subconsciously lower the pitch of their voices to sound more like men and thus more “serious,” resulting in an unnatural rasp — gave her a more sympathetic way into Cassidy.


  “She’s doing this because she wants to sound professional, because she wants to be in this space, because she actually _cares_ about her job and how people view her. Now, I can apply that across the ... board,” Grant says, noting that plenty of men do the same thing with their voices — most notably rapper Lil Wayne. “He’s frying all over the place. But when we hear it in women, we think it’s a joke.”

With temperatures reaching the upper 90s this weekend, we've arrived at the dog days of summer. It's hot, we're listless and yearn for the chill of a crisp fall morning.
   
 Given the pandemic, summer weeks become all the more wearisome, as one day melts into another, with no end in sight. We get up, go though our motions and find it hard to concentrate.
   
 That plays right into the hand of the coronavirus. As Neil Young famously put it, more than 40 years ago, "Rust never sleeps." Nor does COVID-19. Whether it's Florida, Texas, Arizona or, to a lesser degree, Kansas, the virus remains, never sleeping and always dangerous.
   
 While not near the levels of many other states, Kansas rates of infection have risen sharply over the past month, and the state currently receives an "uncontrolled spread" rating. On June 6, Kansas reported 24 new cases, while the week of July 5-12 averaged 429 new ones.
   
 Deaths have not yet spiked, but more cases almost certainly mean increased future fatalities. Still, on a per capita basis, Kansas continues to have lower death rates than our neighboring states.
   
 But COVID-19 never sleeps, and that should be our mantra. Most importantly, we need to proceed with our eyes wide open, as opposed to President Trump's wishful thinking that the virus will just "disappear" and his tendency to ignore expert advice, like that of Dr. Anthony Fauci.
   
 In Kansas, most counties chose to overturn Gov. Laura Kelly's order to wear masks, only to see the number of cases rise steadily. COVID-19 never sleeps.
   
 As summer's dog days head into a fall of K-12 re-openings and the influx of students back to Kansas colleges and universities, how should the state, its educational entities and parents/students react, given that the virus will not, per Trump, magically disappear?
   
 Aside from doing the obvious, such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and encouraging a lot more testing, we all need to be fact-based and flexible. That doesn't mean closing things down at the drop of a hat, but it does require us to face realities and seek to control what we can.
   
 Although K-12 education presents difficult problems, school districts may well have more flexibility that colleges and universities that bring together large numbers of students (and staff/faculty) from many places.
   
 While college students are likely to adjust with varieties of instructional formats and on-campus rules, they seem highly unlikely to comply with mask/distancing guidelines in social situations. What are universities to do with thousands of students who will mingle, socialize and -- let's be clear -- drink?
   
 Borrowing from an excellent overview from the University of Connecticut's Sherry Pagoto, one thing that those in authority -- whether in government or education -- can do is to provide a positive view of what things can look like in the medium-term future, say the spring 2021.
   
 It's really a question of deferred gratification; adults can generally succeed here, however unhappily, but students and other young people will have a much more difficult time.
   
 In the end, higher education institutions should not fear halting in-person classes and encouraging social distancing. Nor should state governments wait to shut things down, per Texas, Arizona and Florida, until the virus has once again ramped up.
   
 In the end, we are human and impatient, but COVID-19 never sleeps.

Andhra Pradesh Governor Bishwabhusan Harichandan seems to have taken a cue from his Telangana counterpart Dr Tamilsai Soundararajan.


  On Tuesday, he held a video-conference from Raj Bhavan in Vijaywada to take stock of the Covid-19 situation in the state.


  In the video-conference, Andhra Pradesh Governor discussed in detail with Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney and principal secretary (health) to review the measures being initiated by the state government to combat the pandemic. Harichandan enquired from the top officials on testing, treatment and medical facilities in government hospitals. The video-conference was also attended by Medical, Health and Family Welfare commissioner K Bhaskar and Rajamouli.


  Harichandan's video-conference with Andhra Pradesh chief secretary comes in the wake of the state reporting more than 4,000 new coronavirus cases and 54 deaths during the last 24 hours, taking the total number of infections in the state to 53,724 and the fatalities to over 696. Last Saturday, the state reported record 3,963 new Covid-19 cases with 52 virus-related deaths.


  In Telangana, Dr Tamilsai Soundararajan had been proactive in assessing the Covid-19 situation in the state. She had openly expressed her anguish and unhappiness over the KCR government's handling of the pandemic. She also called Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and Special Chief Secretary (Health) Shanti Kumari to Raj Bhavan to assess the situation in the state. On several occasions, the Governor was openly critical of the government’s handling of Covid-19 situation in the state, patients being overcharged by private hospitals and lack of equipment in government hospitals. She criticised the government for not testing enough and advised the government to ramp up the testing in the state.


  The Governor’s public criticism over the state’s response to the pandemic did not go down too well with Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao who met her at Raj Bhavan on July 20. The Telangana CM had discussed the measures the government has been taking to contain the spread of the virus, testing and treatment being given to the Covid-19 patients in various government hospitals in the state

These are caused by cuts in the fibre cable from earthquakes, floods, landslips, construction works or rodents damaging cables. Currently, restoring service is a manual process but the sharp growth in network traffic means manual restoration is becoming unmanageable. The optical restoration ‘self-healing’ technology allows the light signals that carry the data to automatically change their path after a fibre cut, so this is a big step forward. We expect to be able to restore services much more quickly so we can get customers back up and running.”

  Yiyun Li, born and raised in China, immigrated to the United States at 22 to study immunology at the University of Iowa. After she took her first writing course, she decided to become a novelist writing in her second language, English. “Writing in English is a personal choice,” Li has said. “It feels natural to me. When it feels natural, you don’t question it, you don’t analyze it.”


  However, she’s also written that in English, “every word has to be pondered over before it becomes my word.” Li may not mean to sound self-contradictory; writing is a deliberative act in any language. But there is a gap between “natural” and “pondered” that piques a reader’s curiosity.


  It’s in that gap where Yiyun Li does her best work, in the questioning place between a thing that comes naturally to her — storytelling — and a thing that she ponders, which lately is the nature of suicide. Her new novel, “Must I Go,” is narrated by a woman named Lilia Liska whose eventful life (three marriages, five children, many grandchildren) has been reduced to a trickle as she nears its end at a senior facility. Lilia’s sharp reminiscences are interspersed with the letters and diaries of her former lover, Roland Bouley, who fathered her eldest daughter, Lucy. Lucy took her own life at age 27.

I want to speak on this simply because I hate the narrative that if you speak your mind as a black person that you will in some way be punished. I have seen this going around and at first I ignored but in this climate I realized this is a dangerous message to send to our generation and the generation coming up. If anything my speaking out showed the corporations I work with how important my voice is and anyone that has a POV. The reality is I was never signed to “SSK” as one would a seasonal show. This business is dynamic and instead of thinking of me as a “series regular” see me see me as a brand that works with the corporation Disney/ABC News and this particular show I was on is no longer. That does not mean the relationship I have with them dies, that means it evolves. I hate talking about business because it can seem a bit weird and gets quite technical lol. But when I see such fear mongering comments I want to speak out so that no one ever feels or thinks that speaking out will cost them their job! I’m sure it can and has before, but let’s also recognize when it has not. That way more of us with our own minds speak out against any injustices we see. Trust me, walking in my truth has always made my blessings OVERFLOW and connect to those that are like minded and not with those that are not. Do not believe this lie.

Saudi operator Mobily said its net profit increased to SAR 185 million in the second quarter ended 30 June compared with SAR 37.8 million in Q2 2019, mainly due to increased revenue from business and wholesale units, as well as the FTTH active base. Revenue amounted to SAR 3.56 billion versus SAR 3.33 billion in Q2 2019, or year-on-year growth of 6.8 percent.
 EBITDA rose 9.3 percent to SAR 1.33 billion from SAR 1.22 billion a year earlier, thanks to an improvement in efficiency in managing operations and the growth of revenues. The EBITDA margin expanded to 37.5 percent in Q2 2020 from 36.7 percent in Q2 2019. Operating profit went up to SAR 334 million from SAR 261 million in Q2 2019, an increase of 27.8 percent.
 For the first six months to 30 June, Mobily reported a net profit after Zakat (alms) and tax of SAR 315 million compared with SAR 105 million a year earlier, driven by a 9.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) revenue growth.
 Gross profit, EBITDA and operating profit also saw an increase, while financial charges dropped to SAR 300 million from SAR 429 million in H1 2019. Revenues increased by 9.6 percent to SAR 7.16 billion from SAR 6.53 billion in H1 2019. This is mainly attributed to growth in business unit revenues, improvement in consumer revenues, growth in wholesale revenues and larger FTTH active base. EBITDA increased by 5.1 percent to SAR 2.62 billion from SAR 2.49 billion in H1 2019.
 In the first half-year, the EBITDA margin shrank to 36.6 percent from 38.2 percent in H1 2019. Capex fell to SAR 1.02 billion from SAR 1.12 billion in H1 2019. Capex continuity reflects the company's commitment to invest in infrastructure and improve the quality of service. Mobily improved its operational cash flow (EBITDA-capex) to SAR 1.60 billion versus SAR 1.37 billion in H1 2019, an increase of 17.3 percent.

“I love researching for fictional storylines because you could just look for the interesting stuff. It’s like a seagull poking through a garbage can,” Donoghue said cheerfully, her Irish accent worn soft by two decades of living in Canada. During our Zoom talk, she pulled a 1910 obstetrics book off the shelf and held its graphic illustrations of difficult births up to the camera to demonstrate what went into her story.


  It doesn’t feel, though, like a historical novel at all. “The Pull of the Stars” moves with the quickness of a thriller, but instead of spies and helicopters there’s nurse Julia Power in an ad hoc maternity ward.


  That sensation of hurtling through the story seems to reflect Donoghue’s own creative metabolism. She has a hard time remembering how many books she’s published since her 2010 novel “Room” became an international bestseller. (Three novels, two children’s books and a short-story collection.) “The new books are always coming down the highway at me,” she said. “I’m focused on ‘Oh, God, which one will I write next?’”
