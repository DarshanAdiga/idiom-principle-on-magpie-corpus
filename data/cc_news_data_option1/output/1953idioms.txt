 A safe boating public awareness campaign held annually in May serves as a good reminder for boaters heading into summer.
 A boat should have enough life jackets on board for all passengers. North Dakota law requires all children ages 10 and younger to wear a personal flotation device while in boats of less than 27 feet in length. The law also requires all personal watercraft users to wear a life jacket, as well as anyone towed on skis, tubes, boards or other similar devices. However, state law allows an individual who is at least 16 years of age to windsurf or boardsail without wearing a PFD.
 Water users should make sure to wear life jackets that are the appropriate size and in good condition. Failure to wear a personal flotation device is the main reason people lose their lives in water recreation accidents.
 Water skiers and tubers should wear a life jacket with four nylon straps rather than one with a zipper, because straps are stronger than zippers upon impact with water. Anglers and persons paddling a canoe or paddleboard should opt for a PFD that is comfortable enough to wear for an entire outing.
 It is also important that children wear a PFD while swimming. Swimmers should know the water's depth, as serious injuries can occur from diving. Large objects hidden below the water's surface can lead to significant injury.
 North Dakota boaters also are reminded that marine VHF radios are an important part of boat safety that should not be improperly used by operators. These radios are intended for boat operators who are in distress and facing an emergency situation.
 Regulations to help ensure safe boating this summer are found in the North Dakota Boat and Water Safety Guide.

The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) released guidelines this week for its 51 member state high school associations to consider when deciding when to resume athletics and other extracurricular activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The guidance document, released Monday, was developed by the NFHS Sports Medicine Advisory Committee, a 15-member advisory committee composed of medical doctors, certified athletics trainers, high school coaches and officials, research specialists and state high school association executives. Dr. Michael Koester, chair of the NFHS committee, stressed that the guidance developed by the committee is intended as ideas for state associations to consider in designing return-to-activity plans.
 The N.C. High School Athletic Association is a NFHS member, but is not bound by the guidelines, which would be superseded by state and local regulations. The NFHS guidance document describes a staged approach to re-opening high school sports and other activities, similar to the phases of “opening up” outlined by the White House in April.

OTOW helping others
   
 Eight thousand pounds of food, 7,500 cookies and $10,000. No, On Top of the World volunteers were not provisioning the First Army.
   
 And while those numbers are staggering, they are not fake news, but actually represent what was collected by neighbors in our community for Interfaith Emergency Services and Brother's Keeper.
   
 It all began as the brain child of Kari Roehl and her husband, Steve, who moved to Candler Hills last July from Michigan where Kari was a health and wellness instructor. As the coronavirus put so many Ocala residents out of work, the dent in charitable giving grew serious. Kari recognized the need and began organizing a foods drive.
   
 "Any little bit would help," she thought, so she started by passing out flyers around the neighborhood and then segued her quest to Facebook.
   
 "The response," Kari said, "was anything but little. It was overwhelming."
   
 On Top of the World neighbors volunteered their homes as drop off/collection centers -- there were 28. Beginning April 22, people began dropping off food, cookies and money by the bagful.
   
 On the following Tuesday, it took 13 volunteers with a Penske truck almost six hours to stop at all 28 homes -- where they sorted and bagged the donations and moved it all onto the truck. From there, 7,500 cookies went to Brother's Keeper, and almost 4 tons of food was accepted by Karla Grimsley, the director of Interfaith Emergency Services, for distribution.
   
 Kari says that she was euphoric with the turnout and the magnanimous giving of On Top of the World neighbors.
   
 "I hope that what we've accomplished as a community will give incentive to others so that when they see a need, they too will step up to the plate," she said.

 A commonsense approach
   
 As nonprofit advocates of smart growth since 1986, 1000 Friends of Florida has long promoted fiscally and environmentally responsible planning and development. We believe tools and resources should be available to design stronger and more resilient communities that allow families to enjoy the natural beauty of our state. We also know mitigation is vital to preserving Florida's historical places and keeping the legacy of our state alive for generations to come.
   
 All this explains our support for bipartisan federal legislation -- HR 1610 by Congressmen Charlie Crist (D-FL-13) and Roger Williams (R-TX-25) -- that would establish a State Flood Mitigation Revolving Fund for homeowners, businesses, nonprofits and municipalities to reduce their risk of flooding.
   
 In the past two decades, flood-related disasters have cost American taxpayers more than $750 billion. Much of that money has been spent on projects simply to rebuild rather than strengthen critical infrastructure, leaving communities just as vulnerable to the next flood. Better preparing for future disasters will reduce future liabilities for governments and their taxpayers, and save precious lives and property.
   
 This proactive approach to flooding makes sense everywhere, but especially in Florida. More than 1.34 million Floridians live in flood-risk areas, more than 2,500 critical facilities are at risk from flooding, and more than 14,000 properties have experienced repeated losses, according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
   
 With another hurricane season looming, and governments at every level now stretched to the limit by the COVID-19 pandemic, it's critical that every public dollar is wisely spent. According to a study from the National Institute of Building Sciences, every $1 spent on hazard mitigation saves $6 in future disaster costs.
   
 Floridians know how important it is to plan for hurricanes. We urge Congress to take up and pass HR 1610.

 Berlin (dpa) - CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt hat den 500 Milliarden Euro schweren deutsch-französischen Wiederaufbauplan zur Erholung der EU nach der Corona-Krise zurückhaltend bewertet. Der Vorschlag von Kanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) und dem französischen Präsidenten Emmanuel Macron «kann ein Weg sein, um die europäische Solidarität und den Zusammenhalt zur Bewältigung der Corona-Krise zu stärken», teilte Dobrindt am Dienstag in Berlin mit. «Wir werden uns die Details genau anschauen, wollen den Weg aber konstruktiv begleiten.» Der Plan braucht nicht nur Einstimmigkeit innerhalb der EU, auch der Bundestag muss zustimmen.
 \n
 Der Schwerpunkt der Hilfen solle auf den Themen Investitionen und Innovationen liegen, betonte Dobrindt. «Es kann keinesfalls darum gehen, nationale Haushalte durch Corona-Hilfsmaßnahmen zu sanieren.» Ziel der CSU sei eine solidarische Lösung in Europa. «Entscheidend dabei ist, dass sich die Lösung innerhalb der bestehenden europäischen Verträge abbilden lässt, die nationalen Parlamente die Entscheidungen tragen und keine neuen Kompetenzen für Brüssel wie beispielsweise ein europäisches Steuerrecht begründet werden.» Nach erster Betrachtung bewege sich der Vorstoß innerhalb der EU-Verträge.
 \n
 Merkel und Macron hatten am Montag ein gemeinsames Konzept für den Wiederaufbauplan vorgelegt. Die 500 Milliarden Euro sollen demnach von der EU- Kommission als Kredite am Kapitalmarkt aufgenommen und über den EU-Haushalt als Zuwendungen verteilt werden. Denn wenn die Länder gemeinsam geradestehen, können sie zu günstigeren Konditionen Geld leihen, als das vielen Regierungen im Alleingang möglich wäre. Krisenstaaten wie Italien oder Spanien, aber auch betroffene Branchen könnten Zuschüsse bekommen. Dafür müssen sich aber alle 27 EU-Länder einig werden. Deutschland dürfte eine der Hauptlasten tragen.

 Meat-free benefits
   
 Kudos to the author of a recent letter with the headline, "Go meatless." The author pointed out the advantages of a meat-free diet. This idea goes along well with a publication in 2013 by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization that stated if the majority of the world's population changed to a meat-free diet, atmospheric carbon dioxide would be greatly reduced.
   
 A recent documentary entitled, "Game Changer" that was produced by Arnold Schwarzenegger discusses a meat-free diet. It was found that many athletes holding world records are often vegetarians or vegans. When an average athlete adopts a meat-free diet, his or her performance greatly improves.
   
 Yearly events called "VegFests" have been held in Gainesville in the last four years. These popular events promote this special diet.
   
 When we change our eating habits in this way, three things are improved. They include the health of our body, the health of the planet and the lives of animals.

 Great time for fishing
   
 I certainly agree with a May 13 letter about the no parking signs at Paynes Prairie. I travel that route frequently and am always glad to see folks fishing. I disagree with reducing the speed limit; it seems perfectly right, people fishing or not.
   
 Was the original complainer afraid of losing control of their car if an enthusiastic fisherman yanked his fish in and it flew through the windshield? With things as they are now, and since Highway 441 isn't littered with bodies, it's a great idea to be out in the weather, and hopefully getting dinner at the same time. The complainer should try it.

 Understanding the risk
   
 A social distancing protester recently justified such irresponsible behavior by saying the American Revolution was fought during a smallpox pandemic by soldiers who willingly braved the risk. Someone else who knew the risk was George Washington.
   
 After serious consideration he re-purposed forts, converting them into inoculation hospitals and requiring strict isolation of over 10,000 troops while they recovered.
   
 Washington's decision paid off. The continental army was not beset by smallpox as it surely would have been without a wiser president. Also, there are no asymptomatic smallpox cases so testing was not as crucial for knowing who to quarantine.
   
 COVID-19 is nearly impossible to confine. Social distance restrictions should be relaxed when our president is brave enough to let unscreened individuals into the White House.

The Center Square) – More than 275,000 gaming and tourism jobs were lost in the weeks following Nevada's casino shutdown. Casino operators are now facing a new challenge – how many employees to bring back to work under the new health and safety guidelines established by Nevada gaming regulators.
 Nevada casinos are on track to reopen in late May or early June, but it will be a slow process. Some are only opening portions of resorts; other establishments are opening only a few venues, leaving the remainder closed until business levels are increasing.
 “Casinos and suppliers will not reopen at the same staffing levels, and the return of the workforce will be phased for the safety of customers, vendors, and employees,” Jennifer Martinez, CEO of Consult HR Partners, told The Nevada Independent. “Operators and suppliers are prioritizing the work areas to re- open initially and the positions needed for each phase thereafter. For example, security and safety, housekeeping, and custodial workers following new procedures may return at the same staffing levels or higher, whereas positions such as event planner or buffet greeter may be hired back in a later phase.”
 Another reason for the phasing in of casino employees is the health and safety constraints on casino occupancy. Resorts are limited to no more than 50 percent of their maximum capacity, must emphasize social distancing and reduce the number of seats at table games.
 "The Nevada Gaming Control Board remains resolute in ensuring that gaming operations in this State do not compromise the health and safety of Nevadans," Michael Lawton, senior research analyst at the Nevada Gaming Control Board, told The Center Square.
 Right now, health and safety are taking priority over the bottom line. January and February revenues for Nevada casinos topped $1 billion. Analysts estimate it could take a year or longer for Nevada to see a billion-dollar gaming revenue month again.
 "The Board has not begun the process of estimating the impact on gaming revenue or collections for FY21," Lawton said. "However, we do acknowledge, based on information we have received, to get back to previous levels of gaming revenue and tax collections could take between 12-18 months."
 Gaming and tourism account for one of every three jobs in Nevada. The industry supports $20 billion in wages and generates $75 billion in economic output each year for the state. The casino workforce has been disrupted twice in the last 20 years, but nothing has compared to a total shuttering of the industry. Many casino employees have been furloughed or laid off.
 "The economic impacts associated with COVID-19 are unparalleled and overwhelming," Lawton said. "If companies are unable to maintain payroll and health care coverage, hundreds of thousands of employees and billions in wages and salaries will be immediately at risk as will the very core of Nevada’s economy and its fiscal system."
 A primary concern for casino employees returning to work is their personal safety. Guidelines from the Gaming Control Board state that casinos are to follow the state and medical guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment and should make the equipment available for its employees and guests.
 “Casino operators are committed to working with gaming regulators and federal, state, and local health officials to develop plans for reopening," Casey Clark, senior vice president, strategic communications at American Gaming Association, told The Center Square. "Any effort will prioritize health and safety while providing a quality patron experience and enabling our industry’s employees to safely return to work.”

Motor control loops, as seen in Figure 1, are mainly made up of a motor, a controller, and a position-feedback interface. The motor turns a rotating shaft that causes the arms of a machine to move accordingly. The motor controller tells the motor when to apply force, stop, or continue rotating. The position interface in the loop provides rotational speed and position information to the controller. This data is central to the proper operation of a pick-and-place machine for the assembly of a tiny surface-mount PCB. All these applications require accurate position measurement information about the rotating object.
