In its Sept. 17 ruling, the divided state Supreme Court said ballots must be postmarked by the time polls close and be received by county election boards at 5 p.m. on Nov. 6, three days after the Nov. 3 election. It also said that ballots lacking a clear postmark could be counted unless there was evidence that they were mailed after the polls closed.

DuBOIS — Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced Monday that charges have been filed against a 29-year-old DuBois man for allegedly inflicting life-threatening injuries on his 4-month-old daughter.
 Dean Garrett Sulin has been charged by DuBois City Police with three felony counts of aggravated assault, Shapiro said during a video conference Monday afternoon.
 “There is nothing, in my estimation, lower than the abuse of a helpless child, a baby,” said Shapiro. “It is abhorrent and it is illegal. We’re here today because a father in Clearfield County decided to put his hands on his infant daughter to shake her into submission.
 Shapiro said the charges are the result of an incident which occurred in January 2018. The child was taken to Penn Highlands DuBois and then subsequently flown to UPMC Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh after suffering life-threatening injuries, including a bilateral subdural hematoma, retinal hemorrhages and extensive bruising.
 “The physicians at UPMC who examined the child determined that her injuries were a result of abusive head trauma previously referred to as shaken baby syndrome,” said Shapiro. “During further examination, the attending physicians determined that the child had a combination of these new injuries but also old injuries as well.”
 Shapiro said his office assumed jurisdiction of the case following the referral from the Clearfield County District Attorney’s office at the end of August 2020.
 “And we moved swiftly,” said Shapiro. “During the course of the investigation, police learned that the defendant was the baby’s sole caregiver that day that she was injured. It is believed that the defendant engaged in a course of conduct of physically abusing his baby daughter. Familial witnesses told investigators that on different occasions, they actually saw Sulin pick up his infant daughter and shake her violently while screaming expletives in her direction — a 4-month-old baby girl.”
 Shapiro said the child’s prognosis at this time is unknown primarily due to the neurological nature of her injuries, noting that she is no longer in the custody of Sulin.
 “There are consequences to harming children in Pennsylvania,” said Shapiro. “We have shown that time and time again when anyone here in Pennsylvania harms a child. We arrested Sulin this morning (Monday) and he faces three counts of aggravated assault. All felonies. He will spend considerable time behind bars upon conviction.

Meghan Markle is known for her vocal, woke and upfront stance when it comes to raising her voice on social injustices prevalent in the world.  
 However, the Duchess of Sussex's days of speaking on these issues may be numbered because of Prince Harry.
 It is said that Meghan will stop talking about these matters once and for all, to help Harry's relationship with the royal family.
 Ever since Meghan and Harry quit the monarchy and moved to the US, they have been actively voicing their opinion on political matters.
 According to historian Robert Lacey, this might come to an end as Meghan's recent speeches may affect Harry's relationship with palace residents.
 "I think when William sat down with Harry and said there could be problems, I think events have proved him right," Lacey, who _penned Battle of Brothers: William and Harry – The Inside Story of a Family in Tumult,_ said during an interview for True Royalty's _The Royal Beat_.  
 "I think that [Meghan] has come to realize how [some of her] speeches risk her husband's relationship with the family and perhaps she may pedal back on some of these more extreme positions," he said on the program, according to _The Sun._
 Meghan and Harry went under fire and received flak after they encouraged people to reject hate speech and vote in the upcoming US election 2020 in their _Time's 100_ PSA.
 This is against royal protocol as members of the royal family are strictly expected to refrain from making political statements and remain politically neutral.
 Meghan even talked about the impact of Black Lives Matter and how she endured racism as a biracial woman in the US.

Playing with sore ribs that limited his practice time last week, Mayfield threw an inexcusable early interception that was returned by Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick for a touchdown and the Browns (4-2) were thrashed 38-7, their 17th straight loss at Heinz Field.
 Mayfield's present and future were heatedly debated on Twitter timelines, sports radio talk shows and office Zoom calls Monday by the arm-chair- quarterback clubs.
 Some things never change in Cleveland.
 After throwing two picks and scrambling for survival, Mayfield spent the last quarter watching from the bench. Stefanski didn't want to expose Mayfield, who was sacked four times and took several hard hits, to any more punishment.
 An argument could be made that Stefanski should have made the move earlier.
 Mayfield's second pick of the first half was the result of another poor decision, and it came on the kind of play elite QBs just don't make. Flushed from the pocket, Mayfield, who finished 10 of 18 for 119 yards, held on to the ball too long before forcing a long pass.
 "There are of course plays that he could have done something differently," Stefanski said. "Our plan was to keep him clean, and we did not do that."
 Stefanski actually did a better job protecting Mayfield than Cleveland's offensive line.
 "There are plays that we ran yesterday that I would not run again and there are things that I did yesterday that I would not call again," he said. "I learned a lesson, obviously in a hard way."
 Mayfield wasn't alone in making mistakes.
 Cleveland's line didn't stop Pittsburgh's relentless rush or open enough holes; Stefanski's schemes didn't fool the Steelers; and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. didn't help matters by making a scene and pouting on the sideline.
 Stefanski didn't point fingers. He waved his hand.
 "There is improvement to be had across the board," he said. "I have a hard time singling one guy out in a game like yesterday," he said.
 Trouble is, Mayfield has had a few clunkers.
 Sandwiched around Cleveland's four-game winning streak are lopsided losses to Baltimore and Pittsburgh, the AFC North's measuring sticks. The Browns were outscored 76-13 in those games and Mayfield threw three interceptions.
 It's a troubling pattern for the 2017 No. 1 overall pick, who has been inconsistent in 35 career starts, and sub-par against quality defenses.
 In three games against Baltimore, Indianapolis and Pittsburgh, Mayfield completed 52 of 94 passes (55 percent) for 505 yards with five interceptions. Take away an excellent first half against the Colts when he passed for 228 and two TDs, and the stats are more alarming.
 Mayfield has shown some growth this season, but there are lingering questions about his ability to throw from the pocket and make good decisions.
 For now, there's no screaming for a quarterback change in Cleveland.

But like Pederson said, the un-scouted looks are interesting.
 In five games Hurts has seven rushes for 49 yards (7.0-yard average) and three first downs. He threw an 18-yard pass over the middle to tight end Richard Rodgers for another first down.
 Hurts blew it trying to run the read option on the two-point conversion attempt following the Eagles’ first TD against the Ravens.
 On the other hand, motioning Hurts across the formation with Wentz at quarterback clearly has helped the Eagles in short yardage situations as it gives the opposition another guy to account for.
 Using Hurts on misdirection plays the way the Pittsburgh Steelers used wide receivers Ray-Ray McCloud (58-yard burst) and Chase Claypool (rushing TD) against the Eagles makes a lot of sense. And you have the throwing option, as well.
 Where is it written that Wentz has to be on the field at the same time Hurts does his thing? Wentz hasn’t acted at all threatened by the use of Hurts. In fact, his block against the Ravens enabled Hurts to roll 20 yards instead of 10.
 Let’s be real about Wentz. Except for the opener, he’s been a slow starter and a big finisher. A little more Hurts early in games, especially with some of those non-scouted looks, might keep the opposition on its heels.
 Let’s also not forget Wentz’s fourth-quarter flurries basically stem from the opposition playing prevent types of defense.
 The downside to giving Hurts an expanded role is it exposes him to injury. After all, he is your backup quarterback unless the Eagles choose to keep Nate Sudfeld active, as well. The injury factor cannot be overstated. Wentz and center Jason Kelce are the only Eagles to start every game on offense this season.
 Wide receiver Greg Ward, who played quarterback at Houston, would be the emergency quarterback should something happen to Wentz and Hurts.
 The other issue is rhythm, or possibly a lack thereof, should Hurts appear more frequently. While it works with Drew Brees and Taysom Hill in New Orleans it’s easier for a quarterback to fall out of rhythm than to get into it, so there’s some risk there.
 Then again, the Eagles’ slow starts and lack of creative play-calling aren’t doing them any favors.
 “It's something that we're definitely going to continue to explore each week if it's conducive,” Pederson said. “It has been successful for us, and I could see things continuing each week that way.”

“We’ve actually sold quite a few houses recently, and so before we even have them started, we have huge lumber increases, which has affected my bottom line,” Chorneyko said.
 “I sold them the house, at the price, and I have to honour that. So that’s one part it. Now anybody new we’re working with, our price is just that much higher.”
 Chorneyko said for Munro Homes, which builds projects in the $600,000 plus range, increased lumber prices have added around $30,000 extra per home.
 “We have to work with that amount that we’re having to eat on all the houses that we’ve done, or that we have sold, and I’m still not sure if that is the high end of it,” he said.
 “That’s across the board, I’m hearing that from everybody – from furnaces, windows and doors, you name it – we’re running into shipment issues,” he said.

“We can help from a front-office perspective by looking at the players that we bring in. Hope is not a strategy when it comes to injuries. When you bring in guys that are injured, it obviously increases the risk that they will get hurt again.”
 And yet, Roseman brought back over 30 veterans who have been prone to injury like tackle Jason Peters and wide receivers DeSean Jackson and Alshon Jeffery. Peters has already missed three games to a toe injury, Jackson has missed three to a hamstring strain, and Jeffery has missed all six following December foot surgery.
 While Vinny Curry had been relatively unscathed over his career, the 32-year- old defensive end, who was re-signed just before training camp, has already missed four games to a hamstring strain.
 Roseman addressed the injury concerns by making several changes to his medical staff in the past offseason. The most significant ones were hiring Tom Hunkele as director of sports medicine/head athletic trainer, and Ted Rath as director of sports performance.
