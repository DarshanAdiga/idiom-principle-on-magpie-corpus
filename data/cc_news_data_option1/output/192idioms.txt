 The Winchester Star recently introduced a new feature, "Volunteer of the Week," where we profile community members who have helped make a positive impact as volunteers. This week's spotlight is on Winchester resident Joi Loewy, a volunteer at Women's Lunch Place.
 We want to cover what matters to our readers. If there is something else you think we should be reporting on, or someone else we should talk to, please let us know here.
 Tell us about your volunteer work. What do you do, and where do you do it?
 I have the privilege of volunteering at the Women's Lunch Place located in Boston's Back Bay at 67 Newbury St. It is a safe, welcoming day shelter community for women experiencing poverty and homelessness. It first opened its door in 1982 and is now open six days a week, providing breakfast and lunch served restaurant style, as well as providing critical support services.
 I volunteer in the kitchen one Saturday a month serving breakfast to over 250 guests. We prep fresh produce and protein for lunch and meals planned for the upcoming week. Volunteers get to do a little bit of everything, helping where ever is most needed, which is the very reason why I love it so much! We get to be very hands on. Chef/Kitchen Manager Sherry Hughes makes everything from scratch so the meals are not only healthy… they are absolutely delicious. (P.S. Last November, Chef Sherry was a contestant on the show "Chopped" …very exciting!)
 How did you get started?
 I first learned of WLP through my church, the Winchester Unitarian Society through our Social Action and Justice Committee. I had been looking for volunteer opportunities where I could be hands on and stay local. From the very first Saturday I volunteered I was hooked. It spoke to my soul and I knew I was in the right place. We have four slots to fill on our shift, so any time there is room for me I go. It has been a wonderful way for me to get to know other church members and staff as we stand side by side, chopping, dicing and serving this beautiful food.
 What keeps you coming back?
 What keeps me coming back to WLP are the women we serve and the inherent worth and dignity they deserve. The feeling of warmth and inclusiveness makes it a safe, welcoming place for all its guests and you get that impression the moment you walk through the door. I am always so impressed by their attention to details such as serving meals restaurant style on china plates and having fresh flowers on every table. It's also a lot of fun. You never know what the menu is going to be. On any given morning we could be removing the seeds from two cases of pomegranates, chopping/spinning 20 heads of lettuce for salad, and marinating 10 pork loins.
 Is there a volunteer experience that stood out to you, or where you feel like you made a significant impact?
 The experience of arriving at 7 a.m. and helping to make all that needs to happen to serve more than 350 guests for the day is amazing to me. To see the impact WLP has on the guests is the most rewarding part. They are tired, cold, hungry and stressed. They can get a shower, wash their clothes, take a nap and have a meal. As they say at WLP "lunch is more than a meal". I've never left once without hearing a guest thanking a volunteer for being there. They don't have to do that, but they do and I hear it over and over during my shift.
 What's your life like in Winchester? Are you a lifelong resident or recent arrival?
 My husband John and I have lived in Winchester in the Muraco School neighborhood for 27 years and raised our two daughters. Our youngest daughter is the only true "New Englander" in the family - she was born at Winchester Hospital 25 years ago. It is also where I have worked for past 11 years. Can't beat the commute! Winchester's ideal location puts us within 10 miles of Boston and all the city has to offer and easy access to miles of trails in the Middlesex Fells right in our own backyard where are family has spent countless hours hiking and walking the dogs. We feel very blessed to call Winchester home for the past 27 years.
 If you know someone who should be recognized for their service, please send an email to athoma@wickedlocal.com. We look forward to hearing from you.
