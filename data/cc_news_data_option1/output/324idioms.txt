TARIQ SAEED PESHAWAR Chief Minister Mehmood Khan led government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that had made major reshuffling in the provincial cabinet in the first week of January and also expanded it , is likely to further increase the size of the cabinet this time with the inclusion of female legislators including those from the merged tribal areas as well. “Some three women members are likely to be included in the provincial cabinet and that will also include a female MPA from the merged areas (formerly FATA)”. Sources said adding the decision to this effect was made in the recently held cabinet meeting. The decision to induct women law makers either in the capacity of minister and advisor may be made in the days to come, yet , as the sources put, they may be given portfolios relating to women affairs to ensure the women empowerment. “A female legislator from the newly-merged tribal areas is also among the members who are likely to be included in the provincial cabinet soon”. Sources said adding Momina Basit, Anita Mehsud ,Maliha Akbar, Ayesha Bano and Aisha Naeem are in the race. However, the official sources preferred to keep mum over the names of the probables. It was also learnt that PTI stalwarts were engaged in lobbying to prevail upon the Chief Minister Mehmood Khan in order to get the lady MPAs of their choice inducted in the provincial government that has been under tremendous pressure from various quarters over the thorny issue of mega project BRT that could not be accomplished despite laps of almost half a dozen deadlines.

_Pristina, 24 gen 09:18 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Anche il direttore dell'Ufficio del governo serbo per il Kosovo, Marko Djuric, ha replicato alla nota del Quintetto dicendo che la Serbia continuerà a condurre una politica in linea con i propri interessi nazionali. Djuric ha osservato che non si possono mettere sullo stesso piano coloro che violano l'Accordo di libero scambio Cefta e coloro che si difendono dall'ingresso di una parte del proprio territorio nelle organizzazioni internazionali. Il governo di Pristina ha invece replicato smentendo di avere mai "ostacolato il dialogo con Belgrado" e dicendosi pronto a tornare al tavolo dei negoziati per raggiungere un accordo "legalmente vincolante sulla base degli attuali confini e del reciproco riconoscimento". Secondo il governo di Pristina, "la decisione di introdurre dazi sui prodotti dalla Serbia e dalla Bosnia Erzegovina è stata necessaria per proteggere gli interessi del Kosovo dalle azioni ostili della Serbia".

Consumers have rights, but National Trading Standards says not many people know where to go to complain.
 It wants anyone who thinks they may have been dealt with unfairly by a quick sale estate agent to get in touch.
 People can also complain to one of two government approved organisations: the Property Ombudsman Limited and the Property Redress Scheme.
 To be an estate agent in the UK you must be registered with one of these schemes, which are able to issue financial awards to people who've been left out of pocket.
 ## 'Don't be rushed'
 Mark Hayward, the chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents Propertymark, says people must do their research and find an estate agent - quick-sale or not - that works for them.
 "I would warn people to make sure they've read the small print and to not be pushed into any price they're not comfortable with," he says.
 "The safest way to get an estate agent is to look for one that is regulated and has professional indemnity insurance.
 "[Your house] is your biggest asset, don't be rushed into making any decision."

The biggest one of those of course came midway through the 2017 season when the team was eight games into an 0-9 start when New England head coach Bill Belichick called to offer quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo for a second-round pick.
 The Niners leaped at the chance and got the most important piece of the rebuilding process. But that wasn’t the only key trade.
 Just before the start of that season, San Francisco sent a fifth-round pick to Detroit for former first-round guard Laken Tomlinson, who almost immediately stepped in as a starter who has been a key part of the line ever since.
 Two more big trades came this past year starting in March when the 49ers dealt a 2020 second-round pick to Kansas City for pass rusher Dee Ford.
 Ford has teamed with rookie Nick Bosa as a formidable edge-rushing duo that has transformed a defense that lacked playmakers into one of the most feared units in the league.
 “His take off, his get off is one of a kind,” defensive tackle DeForest Buckner said about Ford. “Probably the best first step I’ve ever seen. Just to see him, it’s like a track meet. You hear the gun and he’s taking off. It’s pretty impressive to see.”
 Then perhaps the final piece was put into place during the season when San Francisco dealt third and fourth-round picks to Denver for receiver Emmanuel Sanders and a fifth-round pick.
 That filled the void of a No. 1 receiver that the Niners lacked, allowing the offense to step up its production in the second half of the season when the defense was hampered by injuries.

Chicago is widely known as the "windy city" but the California city of Palm Springs has been benefiting from its Santa Ana winds since 1982, when the first wind farm was built in the San Gorgonio Pass.      Coming from Los Angeles, travelers will find thousands of turbines -- about 4,000 -- on both sides of Interstate 10. Driving by, the energy producing "windmills" look big, but travelers can't really get a handle on how big until standing next to one. Some of the blades are more than half the size of a football field, standing about 150 feet tall. At the top, the turbines have a generator that weighs in at 30,000 to 45,000 pounds.      The wind farm provides enough energy to power Palm Springs and the entire Coachella Valley. It is quite a sight, and to get an understanding of how it all works, take a wind farm tour. Best of the Best Tours offers tours with knowledgeable guides -- a lot more fun than science class. For information and to purchase tickets visit thebestofthebesttours.com.      Palm Springs is also known for its movie history. Many famous people lived in this valley, including Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, Tony Curtis, Sandra Dee, Gene Autry, Cary Grant, Elvis and so many more. It was where they escaped to enjoy privacy and relaxation. Today's stars who can be seen in the area include Leonardo DiCaprio, Suzanne Somers, Barbra Streisand and James Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt and President Obama and family.      History walking tours are offered through the Palm Springs Historical Society for those interested in the homes of the stars and architecture. Visit pshistoricalsociety.org. Best of the Best Tours also offers a Rich and Famous Tour that includes homes to the stars.      This valley of 48,000-plus residents offers a large variety of entertainment, from theaters, concerts and plays to horseback riding and snowshoeing. Yes, this warm, sunny, palm-tree-lined city offers winter sports. Take a short tram ride up the mountain -- 8,516 feet -- to Mount San Jacinto State Park, where residents and visitors take part in winter sports and camping, hiking and guided nature walks in the summer. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway takes riders high above the valley to the snow-capped mountains. At the top of the mountain, visitors will find Peaks Restaurant. It offers beautiful views of the Coachella Valley and good food. Also at the top is Pines Cafe, a cafeteria-style restaurant, and the Lookout Lounge, offering alcoholic beverages and appetizers.      The tram itself is an experience. It rotates as travelers ascend and descend the mountain to take in all the views of the valley and the mountains. The first tram was completed in 1963, but a project was completed in 2000 that added new cars and renovated the facilities. It is known as the world's largest rotating tramcar system ever constructed. Visit pstramway.com for details on the tram rides, dining and activities.

Smith testified that was held in a higher-security section of the jail, locked down for 23 hours each day, after other inmates attacked him due to the nature of his charges.
 There was no recommendation for sentencing attached to Smith’s pleas.
 “I’m asking for a second chance because I will do better this time,” Smith said. “I will prove myself independent, resilient. I will never be here again.”
 Commonwealth’s Attorney Chris Rehak asked Smith if he had told police that in one of several dropping incidents, his daughter hit a table and he caught and lifted her by a leg. Smith said that he had.
 Rehak said that the girl’s injuries included multiple fractures to the bones of her legs and feet. He called it a miracle that the girl recovered. The girl’s mother testified that while her daughter still is too young to speak, she seems to be able to move normally.
 Showalter told the girl’s mother, “My heart goes out to you to no end” and said it would be up to her to help her daughter get past the effects of her experience. “You can right the wrongs. She deserves that,” he said.
 Showalter told Smith that he too could find a better life.
 “Everybody writes their own story, their own book,” Showalter said. “You’ve had some bad chapters but that’s not the end of the story.”

These days, I feel like the Invisible Woman. I could stand half-naked on a street corner juggling live chickens and I doubt anybody would notice.
 Not that I need to worry about being seen. We live out in the country and rarely get uninvited guests. Except buzzards.
 One day, while my husband and I were sitting on the patio, I noticed a squadron of turkey vultures circling overhead.
 “Maybe I should go put on some makeup,” I said.
 My husband didn’t laugh.
 “That was a joke,” I snapped.
 He just snickered.
 Today was no joking matter. I had a lunch date with someone I definitely wanted to impress. Someone who would study me the way a cat studies a gopher. Someone who’d take notice of all the details of how I looked, what I wore, how I smelled and every last word I said.
 I was determined to give it my best shot. So I started with a quick shower and a double dose of hair conditioner.
 My hair has been long most of my life, but recently I felt like a change and whacked it all off. (Here’s a little tip: When you feel like making a change, give it a few days before you act.)
 The upside of my new haircut is it takes half as long to dry. The downside is it makes me look like my mother in her later years wearing a football helmet.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon disclosed on Friday that 34 U.S. service members suffered traumatic brain injuries in Iran's missile strike this month on an Iraqi air base, and although half have returned to work, the casualty total belies President Donald Trump's initial claim that no Americans were harmed. He later characterized the injuries as "not very serious."
 Eight of the injured arrived in the United States on Friday from Germany, where they and nine others had been flown days after the Jan. 8 missile strike on Iraq's Ain al-Asad air base. The nine still in Germany are receiving treatment and evaluation at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, the largest U.S. military hospital outside the continental United States.
 Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said the eight in the U.S. will be treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, or at their home bases. The exact nature of their injuries and their service and unit affiliations were not disclosed.
 Trump had initially said he was told that no troops had been injured in the strike, which Iran carried out as retaliation for a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad that killed Iran's most powerful general, Qassem Soleimani, on Jan. 3. The military said symptoms of concussion or traumatic brain injury were not immediately reported after the strike and in some cases became known days later. Many were in bunkers before nearly a dozen Iranian ballistic missiles exploded.
 The question of American casualties took on added importance at the time of the Iranian strike because the degree of damage was seen as influencing a U.S. decision on whether to counterattack and risk a broader war with Iran. Trump chose not to retaliate, and the Iranians then indicated their strike was sufficient for the time being. Tensions have since eased.
 After the Pentagon reported on Jan. 17 that 11 service members had been evacuated from Iraq with concussion-like symptoms, Trump said, "I heard they had headaches and a couple of other things ... and I can report it is not very serious." He said he did not consider the injuries to be as severe as those suffered by troops who were hit by roadside bombs in Iraq.
 Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and former Army Ranger, called on Trump to apologize.
 "TBI is a serious matter," Reed said in a statement. "It is not a 'headache,' and it's plain wrong for President Trump to diminish their wounds. He may not have meant to disrespect them, but President Trump's comments were an insult to our troops. He owes them an apology."
 Traumatic brain injury, or TBI, has become a bigger concern for the military in recent years as medical science improves its understanding of its causes and effects on brain function. It can involve varying degrees of impairment of thinking, memory, vision, hearing and other functions. The severity and duration of the injury can vary widely.
 The Defense Department has said more than 375,000 incidents of TBI occurred in the military between the years 2000 and 2018.
 Jefferson Kinney, a neuroscience researcher at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, where he is chair of the department of brain health, said Friday that much remains to be learned about TBI, including its effects on behavior.
 "It depends a lot on how severe the damage is and where the damage is," among other factors, he said. "There is huge variability across individuals. Some people will undergo a trauma that they seem to recover from very quickly, and others seem to be much more impacted by it for a longer duration."
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a severe TBI may lead to death or result in an extended period of coma or amnesia.
 Hoffman's disclosure that 34 had been diagnosed with TBI was the first official update of the number injured since the Pentagon announced the evacuation of the first 11. On Jan. 21, officials said more had been sent out of Iraq for further diagnosis and treatment, but the Pentagon declined to provide firm figures or say whether any had been returned to duty.
 Hoffman said that of the 34 with TBI, 18 were evacuated from Iraq to U.S. medical facilities in Germany and Kuwait, and 16 stayed in Iraq. The one American sent to Kuwait has since returned to duty in Iraq. All 16 who stayed in Iraq have since returned to duty there, Hoffman said.
 No one was killed in the attack on Ain al-Asad, even though the U.S. had no missile defense systems there to protect from potential attack. Hoffman said Friday that deploying one or more Patriot anti-missile systems to Iraq is among options now being weighed by military commanders. The U.S. had deployed numerous Patriot systems to other countries in the region as protection against Iranian missile attack, including in Saudi Arabia, but a strike on Iraq was seen as less likely.
 Some members of Congress this week pressed the Pentagon for more clarity on the scope of the TBI cases resulting from the Iranian attack. Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., founder of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, wrote to senior Pentagon officials on Thursday requesting additional details on casualties from the attack.
 On Friday morning, Defense Secretary Mark Esper directed the Pentagon's acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, Matthew Donovan, to begin working with the staff of the Joint Chiefs to review how military injuries are tracked and reported — not just TBI cases but battlefield injuries of all kinds, Hoffman told reporters.
 "The goal is to be as transparent, accurate, and to provide the American people and our service members with the best information about the tremendous sacrifices our war fighters make," Hoffman said.

Still, “CDC believes that the immediate risk to the American public continues to be low at this time, but the situation continues to evolve rapidly,” said the agency’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier.
 With Chinese authorities afraid that public gatherings will hasten the spread of the virus, the outbreak put a damper on Lunar New Year. Temples locked their doors, Beijing’s Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland and other major tourist destinations closed, and people canceled restaurant reservations ahead of the holiday, normally a time of family reunions, sightseeing trips, fireworks displays and other festivities in the country of 1.4 billion people.
 Wuhan’s usually bustling streets, malls and other public spaces were unnervingly quiet and masks were mandatory in public. Shoppers emptied store shelves, stocking up for what could be an extended period of isolation. Karaoke bars, movie theaters and internet cafes around the region were shut down.
 While most of the deaths have been older patients, a 36-year-old man in Hubei died on Thursday.
 The vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or involved people who visited the city or had personal connections to those infected. About two dozen cases in all have been confirmed outside mainland China, nearly all of them in Asia: Hong Kong, Macao, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam and Nepal.
 Recalling the government’s initial cover-up of SARS, many Chinese are suspicious of the case numbers reported by officials. Authorities have promised transparency.
 China’s cabinet, the State Council, announced it will be collecting information on government departments that have failed in their response to the outbreak, including “delays, concealment and under-reporting of the epidemic.”

 "We just want to know the truth," Young said at a news conference. "If science can get to the truth, we hope the court will allow the testing so justice can be found."
   
 Twenty-one death row inmates have been exonerated since the early 1990s through DNA evidence. If Lee is ultimately cleared, he could be the first person who has been executed to later be proven innocent with DNA and fingerprint evidence, the Innocence Project said.
   
 Jacksonville's attorney said the physical evidence is not considered a public record under Arkansas law.
   
 "Additionally, should the city release this evidence, there is the possibility that the evidence would be destroyed, further violating evidence retention laws," City Attorney Stephanie Friedman wrote in an email to Jacksonville's mayor and City Council Thursday morning.
   
 Lee was the first of four inmates Arkansas executed in April 2017 before its supply of a lethal injection drug expired. The state had originally planned to execute eight inmates, but four were spared by court rulings.
   
 The groups submitted affidavits from forensic experts questioning other evidence that was used to convict Lee, including claims that partial shoe prints found at the scene of Reese's murder matched Lee's shoe size.
   
 The lawsuit argues the evidence is considered a public record under the state's Freedom of Information law. The groups said it's in the public interest for them to released, particularly since there's no longer an active criminal investigation.
   
 "This is the only avenue open to the Lee family. Why not do it and find out the truth once and for all?" said John Tull, an attorney and FOI expert representing Young.
   
 Other cases where death penalty opponents say innocent men have been executed include Cameron Todd Willingham, who was executed in Texas in 2004 for a fire that killed his children. His guilt has remained in question after his death because the arson science used to convict him had since been debunked.
   
 Innocence Project attorneys last year lost a similar bid for DNA testing they said could have exonerated a Tennessee inmate executed in 2006, and are appealing that decision.
   
 The groups said they're seeking to have the DNA evidence tested at a nationally accredited laboratory at Young's expense to upload the fingerprints to a national database.
   
 "The time is long past overdue to answer the troubling questions raised by the flaws in the presentation of the evidence in this case," the groups said in the lawsuit. "Whether Mr. Lee or another as-yet-uncharged person committed the murder of Debra Reese is a matter of great importance to Ms. Young and the public alike."
   
 Arkansas hasn't executed any inmates since April 2017, and the state's supply of lethal injection drugs has expired. A federal judge is considering a lawsuit challenging the state's use of the sedative midazolam in its lethal injection process.

“(Joshua) is a good friend of mine, I’ve known him since Pre-K," said Mr. Robert.
 Right before winter break, Joshua noticed that Mr. Robert was not at school. Mr. Robert had a set back in his health. He needed heart surgery and could not continue working for the time being.
 “I was like, ‘Whoa, why?’ and I was scared and sad. I just wanted to figure out what I could do and what was wrong with him," said Lawrence.
 Joshua watched a video about selflessness soon after. That was when he knew needed to do something for his friend.
 He saved up his money to buy pencils and erasers to sell them at school for 25 cents in hopes of donating the proceeds to Mr. Robert.
 Eventually, it grew to other students getting involved and being able to sell treats, like muffins and coffee, before school and during lunch.
 “Pride, lots of pride. It's just heartwarming to be able to see the simple idea that he came up with coming into fruition," said Bonham Elementary School Principal Gloria Garcia- Rhodes.
 Joshua and his school started the sales after winter break and have been able to raise $650.
 “It feels really good inside and warm. I know Jesus is proud of me," said Lawrence.
 Mr. Robert is usually the one taking care of the students and teachers at school.
 "Now they’re taking care of me, ain’t that something? I couldn’t believe it, I never had this done for me. I’d just like to thank everybody," said Mr. Robert.
 He can't wait to get healthy enough to get back to school and be with his friend again.
 Since the sales started, the community got word of what Joshua was doing and started donating money and items like pencils and erasers. If you would like to donate, head over to Bonham Elementary and stop by the front office where there is a donation box. Checks can be made out to Robert Ramirez.

The reason China's swift and suspicious behavior for not disclosing information about natural wounds and catastrophes (ie the 2009 earthquake) may partly be due to a traditional belief called the Mandate of Heaven. By mandate, major disasters such as famine, floods, wounds, and earthquakes were a sign from the heavens that the gods were unhappy with the current ruler - reluctance to admit this to the public would often lead to civil unrest, as the masses believed the heavens were warning people about the illegality of the ruler.

 “I’m not going to go into specific detail, but during the course of the playoffs in ’17, everybody was using multiple signs,” Keuchel said, “I mean, for factual purposes, when there’s nobody on base, when in the history of major league baseball has there been multiple signs?

Arizona Sen. Martha McSally’s outburst last week is just the latest example. When asked by a CNN reporter whether she’d support allowing witnesses at the impeachment trial, this once sober-minded politician called him a “liberal hack,” creating a viral social media moment perfectly suited for cable news preening and digital fundraising.
 A new book by Washington Post reporters, “A Very Stable Genius,” recounts in alarming detail how early members of the Trump administration struggled to teach the president the rudiments of the job of commander in chief, only to be rebuffed as “dopes and babies” because they didn’t see our international alliances and military assets as an opportunity to turn a profit. Two years later, he’s surrounded by a coterie happy to let Trump be Trump.
 The impeachment drama itself stems from the fact that no one can convince the president that the presidency is more than the whims, desires and ambitions of the person occupying the job.
 Unfortunately, the responses from Democrats, much of the media and opponents of the president, although emotionally understandable, have often compounded the damage.
 My American Enterprise Institute colleague Yuval Levin has written tellingly about the Trump era: “My rule of thumb … is that every scandal will proceed in whatever way is maximally damaging to public confidence in our core institutions. Each twist and turn and revelation will give everyone on all sides of our politics … just enough reason to believe that their side is in the right, the other side knows it but is corrupt, and the only way to get justice is to recognize that there is no alternative to stretching the norms and rules of our politics a little in this particular case.”

Hancock originally left his position as head coach to take on a coaching position at Springfield Catholic. He spent 28 years coaching Branson football and finished with a record of 193-102.
 Hays said that Hancock was actually one of the first people he called when he was looking into the head coaching position at Branson. That being said, Hancock and Hays have been friends for a number of years. Hays said that he would often mention the possibility of Hancock returning to Branson to Hancock’s daughter who works at Branson High School.
 “I told her on several occasions, ‘when you think your dad might be ready to retire at Springfield Catholic and coach back at Branson, just let me know,’” Hays said. “Sure enough she said ‘hey, my dad is kind of contemplating his future,’ so I gave him a call.”
 As Hancock is still living in Branson, he spent time commuting to Springfield Catholic. He said the opportunity to return to Branson seemed to be the perfect fit for him and his family.
 And he said the fact that he’s returning to the staff is pretty special.
 “I spent a lot of years coaching at Branson,” Hancock said. “So I’ve still got a lot of black and red in my blood. It’s kind of neat to be able to have the opportunity to come around, and it’s kind of like a full circle.”
 Branson’s athletic director David Large said it’s always nice to bring in a coach as an assistant who has the knowledge and experience such as Hancock. He added it’s something he’d like to see across the board for Branson sports.

This would seem to be another scary road game for the Broncos against a Fresno State team that is just 6-13 on the season and 2-6 in Mountain West play.
 Boise State has lost four of its past five games at Fresno State, and they are projected by KenPom.com to lose this one, 70-68.
 "They are one of those teams where if you never looked at their record you'd think they were no different than UNLV and these teams," Rice said. "They lost in overtime at Utah State, lost in double overtime to UNLV, so they are right there. They are good and talented.
 "They are so much better than their record. I know that and our team will know that."
 Boise State has a manageable part of the schedule coming up. They have winnable games at home against San Jose State and Nevada and at Wyoming coming up after the trip to Fresno.
 And that's why a win against the Bulldogs would be so big. It's not crazy to think in two weeks the Broncos could be riding a five-game winning streak and be 16-8 overall and 8-4 in league play when they head to Utah State on Feb. 9.
 But that means they'll need to pass a tough test at the Save Mart Center against Fresno State. It's a game the Broncos badly need to win, and one on paper they should have a decent chance of getting.
 But they are on the road, and we know what that's meant so far this year.

ORLEANS -- Casting the clouds aside in his crystal ball Orleans Town Administrator John Kelly peered ahead to 2026, discerning expected town expenditures.
 He was reporting to selectmen last week about capital planning items, and with the sewer construction about to get under way (bid requests will soon be issued) there are multiple big ticket items in the offing. The sewer phases are under town control and others, such as the renovation of Nauset Regional High School, are not.
 Kelly said he wants non-school spending increases to stay under 4 percent (not including debt) for the coming year, and he hopes school increases will stay there as well. Currently the non-school estimated budget is up 4.7 percent but that will be trimmed.
 There is debt falling off the books so the property tax rate might drop slightly (before the sewer tab kicks in) and Orleans should have $1.48 million available in free cash.
 The downtown sewer and treatment plant has an estimated cost of $47,382,800, which was approved at the May 2019 Town Meeting. Orleans is applying for a loan from the State Revolving Fund for wastewater. That could include 10 percent loan forgiveness and zero percent interest.
 That's only the beginning of the sewer work, however. In addition to $1.6 million in adaptive management planning design and construction for 2020 Orleans is looking at $23,184,100 to construct sewers around Meetinghouse Pond in East Orleans in FY2023 as well as assorted planning and design expenses for the work prior to that, adding up to another $1.8 million.
 The town is also planning for close to $33 million in spending on permeable reactive barriers, with $14 million of that slated for FY2026. If the barriers work after testing the town will spend $7.8 million in FY2022 and six figure sums in the following years.
 "There's a lot (of PRB expense) over the next five years," Kelly admitted.
 The barriers are to intercept nitrogen migrating toward Orleans salt water, thus lessening potential sewer costs - although they themselves aren't cheap. The Meetinghouse Pond and PRB portions of sewer spending have yet to be approved at Town Meeting.
 Orleans is still working on a Nauset Beach retreat plan to create parking away from the eroding beach for when the artificial dune is washed away. The town will move beach operations and food services to safer ground. They've slated $5.6 million in 2022 for that along with $400,000 to improve the road into the Hubler property (where parking will be). The retreat plans were pushed back a tad when Orleans opted to build the artificial dunes last year instead of implementing the full retreat.
 Nauset High could be renovated if the funding article passes all four district town meetings this spring. Orleans has budgeted $25.7 million for that in the coming year but all four towns will have to decide on a debt schedule. The expectation is the district will receive about $37 million from the state for the $132 million project.
 Based on this year's enrollment Orleans is responsible for 19.5 percent of the Nauset budget, which could reduce its contribution to the renovation (last year the town contributed 20 percent) but final numbers are still unknown.
 Other projects
 Orleans is looking at $6.5 million or so to repair the Rock Harbor loading dock over 2021 and 2022 in a two-year project. There is also a $3.6 million repair and replacement of the bulkhead at the town landing next to the Goose Hummock Shop.
 The long contemplated Nauset Estuary dredging project is pegged at $3 million by 2022. That awaits permits.
 The Orleans Elementary School needs new windows ($1.6 million in FY2023) and the there are other smaller, less costly tasks there.
 Snow Library will need improvements including a new roof ($700,000 this year) and there are annual maintenance budgets for vehicles, buildings, etc., along with $1.6 million in water department work. Kelly said Orleans will probably do a study of the Snow Library in 2022 that could result in renovation/new construction.
 He said the town capital plan will be discussed Feb. 12, and with the finance committee on Feb. 20. It also was on the Jan. 22 selectmen's agenda (after The Cape Codder's print deadline).

2.    No amorticen, haciendo gastos superficiales. Estos son momentos en los que tener liquidez es muy valioso, pues quienes no estén preparados para la crisis venderán activos importantes. Hay que gastar en lo que deja, luego en lo demás, y tener efectivo para poder invertir, pues muchos bienes bajan de precio. Para poder hacer esto, hay que dejar los gastos superficiales, hasta la segunda mitad del año.
 3.    Aprovechen los programas gubernamentales. Hay varios programas que en momentos como este, se pueden convertir en una gran oportunidad. El programa de Jóvenes Construyendo el Futuro es un buen ejemplo. Podemos recibir jóvenes becarios, y capacitarlos para que se conviertan en parte de nuestra fuerza productiva. Durante un año –Si, un año- ellos recibirán una beca del gobierno federal, con lo que no aumentará el gasto de nómina.
 4.    Inviertan en vender. Si, este es un momento en el que la mejor inversión que podemos realizar es en publicidad, tener vendedores, armar promociones, porque es mejor vender, y tener movimiento, que tener negocios vacíos, o anaqueles llenos. 
 5.    No malbaratar activos. En los siguientes meses, bajarán de precio los automóviles, las casas y los terrenos. Maquinaria y equipo de negocios que no funcionaron. Es un mal momento para vender, porque muchos quieren hacerlo, pero hay poca plata y poca seguridad para comprar. Por ello, no son momentos en los que se recomiendo deshacerse de activos. 
 6.    Consentir a los Clientes. Estos momentos, los momentos de recesión y de crisis, son en los que las empresas que no cuidan a sus clientes los pierden. Telcel le dio oportunidad y margen de crecimiento a Telefónica en la pasada recesión mexicana. Lo mismo sucedió a Sears, que le dejó gran parte de su mercado a Liverpool. Hay que entender que estos son momentos de “apapachar” al cliente, ofreciéndole promociones y estrategias de fidelidad.          Espero que estos breves consejos te sean útiles, para sacar adelante estos meses de recesión. Sin más, un extraordinario 2020 para ti Amigo lector.

Jeffrey said that operations against IS fighters have been on hold since a January 3 US drone strike near Baghdad airport killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. The killing of Soleimani prompted retaliatory strikes from Tehran on an Iraqi base hosting US troops and a vote in Iraq's parliament for the removal of foreign forces.

It is tempting to throw our hands up in the air and say we cannot do that mostly because the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR) passed in 1992. TABOR paralyzes government spending on infrastructure. It is also tempting to say that voters have rejected the last three ballot measures that addressed transportation. But we cannot afford to do that. Coloradans don’t like blank checks to an agency like CDOT, and they were never asked to invest in a train to the mountains. It may be time we ask the specific question, and it may need to be focused on only some of the taxpaying population of the state that will more directly benefit from such a project. A success story is Fastracks, a transit specific ballot initiative that was overwhelmingly approved by the voters in 2004.

It may never materialize, but federal, regional and local officials continue dreaming about the possibility of a San Diego Grand Central Station that could be a terminus for rail and bus lines and provide a transit link to the airport. This week, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the San Diego Association of Governments, met with acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly at the Pentagon to sign a deal to allow the Navy to transfer its 70-acre Old Town Complex to in exchange for new facilities for some 6,000 cybersecurity professionals.
 It’s kind of a big deal, as the saying goes. According to The San Diego Union- Tribune reporter Jennifer Van Grove, the exclusive agreement could lead by the end of March to a term sheet detailing how the land will be transferred, if all goes well. The deal signing on Thursday signals a commitment from the Navy that it’s full speed ahead. Richard Spencer, the previous Navy secretary, had backed the arrangement with SANDAG in September but was removed from his high- profile post two months later. There’s now no reason to doubt the federal government’s commitment, and it will be up to regional leaders to show ongoing support in April for a redevelopment project that may reshape the region.
 At a time when so much is made about the clashes between the federal government and California politicians, it’s reassuring to see big progress is possible. A lot remains to be done, including environmental studies and approvals at regional, state and national levels. This project probably shouldn’t even be called a project yet, it’s so early in its planning stages, but cheers to all involved this week.

Staffers had to communicate the threat of a student with a possible gun on campus by running through the halls.
 Instead of mass communication, it was passed through word of mouth due to a faulty intercom system.
 Some students say their classrooms had no idea until they saw a police presence on campus.

The Usos came out first. Cole was bursting blood vessels in his temples to convey his excitement about how it was almost WrestleMania season and you could feel it in the air. Graves seemed slightly taken aback, but then said the WWE Universe is buzzing over what's on the horizon. Reigns came out next and looked around the crowd before his pyro blasted. Cole said Reigns will pull double-duty at the Rumble, as he'll face Corbin a Falls Count Anywhere match and the Rumble match. Cole excitedly listed the places around the ballpark where the fight might go on Sunday. Corbin was then carried to the ring on a throne with Roode and Ziggler leading the way. A couple minutes in, Roode backdropped Jimmy over the top rope. Ziggler then charged and rammed him back-first into the steps and post. He was down and stayed down. The ref checked on him and instead the other wrestlers back away. The ref called for medics to check on him. Jey yelled for them to "check his head." Jimmy was helped to the back, looking concussed. Cole asked if Jey and Roman will have to continue alone. [c]

 No way, no how can I mend all of the hurt that this world seems to have affixed to it. These days, people are sent off to die for the simple reason that they don't have the money for medical care.
 People are starving to death when each night restaurants throw still edible food into Dumpsters instead of being kind enough to donate to hunger centers.
 Innocent children are given a second-class education because their parents can't afford to send them to higher grade learning centers. Decent, hard- working people who have worked like dogs all of their lives and never had anything to show for it are looked at as sub-human because they don't meet society's financial standards. I feel the hurt because I lived the hurt a few years ago and it changed me for life.
 There are a lot of good people hurting these days, but that does not mean that they are not good people. No way can I mend all of the hurt that this world seems to have affixed to it these days, but I can try.
 If each of you have anything you might feel is your trash, be kind enough to think before you throw it out. Your trash maybe someone else's treasure.
 Bonny Owens, Winter Haven
