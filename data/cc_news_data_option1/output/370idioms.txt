Browns co-owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam convinced one of their favorites to return as they prepare to announce the hiring of Andrew Berry as general manager and executive vice president of football operations on Tuesday.
   
 But whether Berry 2.0 will bring the Haslams their long-sought alignment remains to be seen.
   
 The former Browns vice president of player personnel, Berry worked with chief strategy officer Paul DePodesta for three seasons before moving on to the Philadelphia Eagles in 2019. There is no question about the synergy between Harvard graduates Berry and DePodesta, verified as DePodesta ran the searches to find successors for coach Freddie Kitchens and GM John Dorsey.
   
 The Berry-Kevin Stefanski dynamic is the one that bears watching.
   
 Was the time Berry and Stefanski spent together when Stefanski twice interviewed for the coaching vacancy last January enough for them to click? That's just the better part of two days to get to know each other.
   
 They had to bond over more than their Ivy League history, with both playing defensive back in college, Stefanski at Penn. They had to find the roots of a similar vision, the two now charged with resurrecting a franchise that cannot get past its reputation as a laughingstock of the league.
   
 Stefanski would have been more comfortable with Vikings assistant GM George Paton, with whom he worked for 13 seasons in Minnesota. But after being interviewed twice, Paton took himself out of the running on Friday, possibly realizing Berry was the front-runner or uncomfortable with the organizational structure even with Stefanski at his side.
   
 Each scenario had a flaw.
   
 In the Berry-Stefanski-DePodesta triumvirate, Stefanski is the one who has to become comfortable with two men he doesn't know. With Paton-Stefanski- DePodesta, the latter would have been the odd man out.
   
 In either case, all report independently to the ownership group, which also includes the Haslams' son-in-law, JW Johnson.
   
 Berry, 32, becomes the youngest GM in the league. Stefanski, 37, is the third- youngest coach. As DePodesta now slides back into his regular role, Berry and Stefanski can team to build something they can be part of for a long time. They can break the cycle of the Haslam regime, with a lack of continuity the only thing that can be counted on. They can blend analytics and football, which DePodesta believes is the path to success.
   
 But that path will not be without pitfalls. The Berry-Stefanski-DePodesta team will face its first challenge quickly, after running back Kareem Hunt was pulled over for speeding on Jan. 21 and Rocky River police found a small amount of marijuana and an open bottle of vodka in his backpack. Hunt was cited for speeding, but not charged with a drug offense. The NFL is investigating.
   
 Free agency opens at 4 p.m. March 18 and Berry-Stefanski-DePodesta must decide if they are tendering restricted free agent Hunt. He served an eight-game suspension last season for violating the league's personal conduct policy. The deadline for offer sheets to be signed is April 17. Fans will find out quickly where the trio stands on the character issues that second-chance Dorsey cast aside.
   
 When Stefanski was hired, pairing him with Berry and DePodesta seemed like the dream team, and that perception has not changed.
   
 The Haslams are not holding the fact that the Browns went 1-31 over two seasons when Berry and DePodesta worked with coach Hue Jackson against them. The owners are overlooking the fact that quarterbacks Carson Wentz and Deshaun Watson were passed over in the 2016 and 2017 drafts when EVP Sashi Brown was in charge.
   
 Even if that's revisionist history or Brown has become an easy scapegoat, alignment is Jimmy Haslam's goal. With the relationship between Berry and Stefanski in its infancy, that's no certainty.
