Judge William Osteen issued an injunction requiring state officials to revise a directive issued Sept. 22 that allowed voters to fix a lack of a witness signature by returning an affidavit and not casting a new ballot from scratch. However, he said he wouldn't block that kind of fix for small errors such as an incomplete witness address or a signature in the wrong place.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the International Monetary Fund's debt restructuring programme should aim at helping the countries overcome the fiscal stress caused by the coronavirus pandemic. "...it would be important to take into consideration the circumstances and concerns of both creditors and debtors and that in the process of debt restructuring, care must be taken to not saddle the debtor countries with overly burdensome conditionalities," she said while addressing the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting through video conferencing. One of the key outcomes of the G20 Action Plan has been the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) which provides time bound suspension of debt service payments for the low-income debtor countries that request forbearance, a finance ministry statement said.   The initiative came into effect in April was initially agreed till end of 2020. During this meeting, in light of the continued liquidity pressures, it said the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors agreed to extend the DSSI by six months, and to examine by the time of the 2021 IMF/World Bank Group Spring Meetings if the economic and financial situation requires a further extension of the initiative.  To receive DSSI relief, countries are required to apply for an arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which could be either a regular programme or a shorter-term emergency facility.  Talking about addressing the debt vulnerabilities of low income countries, Sitharaman observed that in a longer term, a more structural treatment of debt is required. She emphasised that this process should primarily be guided by the objective of helping such countries overcome the fiscal stress caused by the pandemic. Addressing her counterparts, Sitharaman highlighted the need to balance the health and economic objectives in the recovery plans.  Besides, the finance minister also spoke about the need to consider heterogeneity of policy responses among member countries, international spillovers from domestic policy actions and reforms required in the global regulatory regimes, particularly with respect to the procyclicality of credit rating downgrades. Updated commitments in the G20 Action Plan have to be kept relevant in the current policy context for the action points to remain effective as a policy response to Covid-19, she added.

TUCCA specifically identified the speakers and the topics covered in the workshop to meet the needs of local farmers. 'The farmer already knows their farm, and they already know what they need. The key to it is to take what the farmers say they need and try to take USDA practices or some type of opportunity and marry those two together, and that's how we help farmers,' Williams said.

Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg on Wednesday urged EU leaders to "do as much as possible" to step up the bloc's ambitions to reduce carbon output at this week's summit."Of course none of what has been proposed or pushed is in line with the science, but we are still demanding them to do as much as possible... to commit to what they had promised to do" in the 2015 Paris Agreement, Thunberg told AFP in an interview.Leaders must agree by the end of this year on their 2030 targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the European Commission has proposed a goal of slashing them 55 percent compared with 1990 levels -- up from 40 percent under earlier plans.The ultimate aim under Brussels' timetable would be carbon neutrality by 2050.Now heads of government will have their say, and must hammer out an option palatable to a European Parliament that has already criticised the Commission's plan as not ambitious enough.On Wednesday, 11 member states including France, Spain and the Netherlands backed reductions of "at least 55 percent" by 2030.But many countries in the EU's east, notably coal-intensive heavyweight Poland, are reluctant.Climate charities have warned that reductions of 55 or even 60 percent in EU greenhouse output would fall short of what's needed to keep global warming below the two-degrees-Celsius ceiling agreed in Paris.

Having been struggling with a knee injury suffered in a pool match against Fiji, he was compromised by the time the latter stages of the tournament came around.
 "I don’t think it was quite one leg, maybe one and a half!" he jokes.
 "I felt capable enough of going out there and giving a performance. It was heavily strapped and I was in pain but the hard work put in by the medical team to get me right to go out and play meant I was able to do that.
 "I was told if I played the semi there was a risk of not finishing my career. It was worth the risk. I made that decision. It was tough going those last few games but it was something you do."
 The end result was Davies being sidelined for the best part of a year after undergoing surgery on the knee following the tournament.
 A lot has changed since then.
 Wales' coaching ticket are different. So too their kit providers. On a personal note, Davies is now married.
 And, on a wider note, the world is considerably different too, with Welsh international rugby about to get to grips with life during the coronavirus pandemic for the first time.
 It makes that World Cup in Japan seem all the more distant, yet there's one thing that thankfully hasn't changed despite the uncertainty of the past 12 months.
 That is the idea of Jonathan Davies, not out. The prospect of the 32-year-old adding to his 81 caps for his country.
 Because, naturally, there would have been times where the thought of pulling on the red jersey seemed in doubt.
 “I’m not sure about that because the type of surgery I had meant there was a waiting game," is the response when asked if there doubts over whether he'd return.
 “I had to keep my knee dead straight for twelve weeks and at that point, I had a scan to see how the surgery went. All other operations that I have had, you know you have been repaired when you are in the hospital bed and you have been stitched back up.
 “But with this one, I was hoping the body would adapt and help itself to recover."
