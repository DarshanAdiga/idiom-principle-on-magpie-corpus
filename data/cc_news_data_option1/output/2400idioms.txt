GENEVA: The World Health Organization said Thursday that a few hundred million COVID-19 vaccine doses could be produced by the end of the year -- and be targeted at those most vulnerable to the virus.The UN health agency said it was working on that assumption, with a view to two billion doses by the end of 2021, as pharmaceutical firms rush to find a vaccine.

In these days of staying at home, humans tend to get bored. Well, dogs are not any different. Normally we take ourdogs for walks, and most of the time it is for our benefit as much as it is for our furry family members. “Working-class dogs are happiest when they have a task to do,” believes Heath Cram of Lyons.
 Heath got his first dog back in the 90s. “I have had many different breeds of dogs, but I just fell in love with the German Shepard.” Back then, the German Shepard had a stigma about them much as Rottweilers and Pit Bulls have today. Like many people, Heath believes it is the owner, not the dog when it comes to aggressive tendencies. As some people need something to do to make them happy, dogs are the same way.
 Heath has set up a training routine for his dogs. “I start off almost every day with half-mile sprints along a stretch of road. I am in the car as they follow me. We go up and down the road for 2 miles.”
 He explained that he takes great care to make sure the dogs that he trains stay healthy and gradually work up to the whole work out. Although it is not every day you might see Heath and his large German Shepard, Duke, pulling a wagon with their Sheltie, himself, and whatever they might have to haul that day.

No. La política es una parte pequeñita de la vida. Lo que yo intento es invitar a los lectores a que desarrollen un espíritu crítico respecto a todo lo que se les presenta y ante todas las personas que les quieren convencer de que piensen o traguen algo determinado. Que se cuestionen los motivos. Que se cuestionen por qué y luego, con su propio criterio, decidan lo que quieren pensar. Yo no soy un cura. No quiero convencer a nadie de nada. Ni soy un político.

You have the professionals talking about the importance of reinforcements and for every 1 negative you say to a child you should give 10 positives. You have the group of people that say time-out is all you need. I was of the generation that we still got a swat when we really misbehaved and got called out for doing something wrong.
 When I got in trouble or got bad grades in school, I had to take responsibility for my actions because my parents sided with the teacher. Which I am all for, now. My parents always seemed to know when it was me and when it was the teacher. Trust me, siding with me was few and far between.
 My parents have the opinion that the millennial generation is too soft. There are times when I was younger that I would have agreed, but the millennials are the ones with kids and listening to our parents tell their stories. I guess what I am getting at is that every generation has changed when it comes to their children.
 Every generation thought that they had it harder. And from the stories that I have heard, they were right. I still believe that the goal of every parent is to make their children’s lives better than what they had. However, we shouldn’t forget the lessons of the past. If we were getting to the point where just telling scary stories of the past would be enough to deter bad behavior, that would be great. Unfortunately, I personally think we are not there yet, but if we find the right balance of past and new tactics, we might just get there.
 Next time you hear that same old story think to yourself what will yours be to your grandchildren?

College football was not made for Black players in the makeup of the men who lead them. A major college football head coach is often the highest paid state employee if his school is public. Even if it’s not, he’s likely the most front-facing person of his university. Not just athletics, mind you. I mean the whole school. The system is there to churn players out in four-year intervals while the coaches remain for decades shaping the fabric of the sport. The culture of the leadership can opt to remain the same because it has laurels to rest on. Players are only around for a flash in the pan.

Douglas County board Chairman Clare Duda, who has served for 44 years with the Ponca Hills Volunteer Fire Department, recognized the difficulty in such a transition.
 “I've watched a few other departments go through the transition from volunteer to combination and then fully paid,” he said. “It's kind of a tough transition as a rule and I wish you well with it, but it also seems inevitable.”
 While the change was unanimously approved, Supervisor Lisa Kramer, District 2-Kennard, the only member of both boards who lives in the Bennington fire district, was critical of the process.
 Kramer reached out to her constituents for input on the matter. Of those she spoke with, none were aware the fire district was seeking to convert to a suburban district, which could raise the levy 5 cents from 0.01355 to .06355. That would be an increase of $50 per $100,000 of property value per year of a property owner.
 “There was zero transparency in the process,” Kramer said. “Although most people expected it, knowing that they built the largest and most expensive fire station in the state of Nebraska that included living quarters, most people expected that this would be coming, but nobody knew.”
 Counties can levy up to 50 cents. The 5-cent increase would represent 10 percent of the county's taxing authority, which Kramer said is significant.
 “That is significant enough that the route that people believe they should have taken in order to get permission to transition to a suburban district was to make it a vote of the people,” she said. “There was a primary election just one month ago. The rural fire board could have opted to place this issue on their ballot and actually make their case to the people and represent the people and justify the need. I believe they would have received overwhelming support. I honestly do based on the input I've received from my taxpayers in my district. But they didn't do that.”
 Instead, the fire district board approved a resolution through a private ballot during a meeting in which 17 people were in attendance.
 “If I were to hazard a guess, I would guess that the majority of those in attendance were rural fire department volunteers,” Kramer said. “That doesn't reflect well on the transparency of the process. It doesn't change necessarily the need, but it does reflect poorly on the process.”
 Kramer urged the Douglas County commissioners to take an active role in the fire district's budget process.
 “Because we don't have the opportunity to vote for you as Douglas County board members when we reside in Washington County, I implore you to use your fiduciary responsibility to be very involved in the budget process for this department moving forward to make sure they are using our tax dollars wisely,” she said.
 No one from the public spoke for or against the issue.

Mumbai Zoological parks and wildlife rescue centres across Maharashtra have refused to reopen for visitors for the time being, in a bid to keep captive animals and its staff safe during the Covid-19 pandemic.Days after the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) under the Union environment ministry allowed zoo operators to take a call on reopening zoological parks to visitors following the relaxation of lockdown rules under Unlock 1 from June 1, a review by the Maharashtra Zoo Authority (MZA) showed that none of the state zoos have opted to reopen.The decision comes at a time when Melghat Tiger Reserve was reopened for tourists on Friday while the buffer area of Pench and Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve will be reopened from July 1.There are 10 zoological parks and four rescue centres in the state. Of these, two are medium-sized zoos - Virmata Jijabai Bhonsale Udyan and Zoo in Byculla, and Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Wildlife Research Centre in Pune. The remaining eight are mini zoos across Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Solapur, Kolhapur, as well as the Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Borivli (classified as a mini zoo by CZA)."We reviewed all the major zoos. So far, none of them are open for visitors due to prevailing local situation and threat of the pandemic," said Ravikiran Govekar, member secretary, MZA. "We have asked the zoo operators to consult local authorities empowered by the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act before taking any decision."As per the circular issued by CZA on June 10, based on guidelines from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the decision to reopen zoos for the public has to be taken by zoo operators based on consultation from the state disaster management authority. "Zoological parks across Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh were reopened for the public but there have been no visitors at all," said SP Yadav, member secretary, CZA. "The final decision has to be taken by state authorities and the zookeepers based on the prevailing Covid-19 situation across the city, district or state," he said.Byculla Zoo authorities said they have no plans to reopen till the end of July. "The Mumbai Metropolitan Region continues to have some of the highest Covid-19 positive cases in India, and it is not wise to reopen the zoo at the moment," said Sanjay Tripathi, zoo director. "Our zoo comes under the large entertainment park category, and no relaxations have been issued for that category by the state or civic body. It will be safer for captive animals and our 35 staff members who have been residing within the zoo premises since March."Other zoo operators highlighted the example of a tiger that had tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, at Bronx Zoo in New York on April 5. "Among 450 animals, birds and reptiles, we have a large number of big cats. Under no circumstances can we risk their safety by reopening the zoos at the moment," said Rajkumar Jadhav, zoo director, Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park in Pune.Meanwhile, rescued or captured tigers have been sent for rehabilitation and treatment to the Gorewada Wildlife Rescue Centre in Nagpur during the pandemic. Officials said they had to be extra careful after the Bronx case and ensure minimal human contact with the animals. "We plan to inaugurate the zoo only after Nagpur is declared a green zone. We have one of the highest numbers of captive and rescued tigers with us. So far, no animals have displayed symptoms of illness," said Nandkishor Kale, divisional manager, Gorewada project.Meanwhile, CZA on June 11 had also directed the mandatory deployment of round-the-clock veterinarians at zoos, to keep a close watch on the behaviour and health parameters of the captive animals.

Ronald Salguero se declaró inocente durante la audiencia, celebrada por videoconferencia debido a la pandemia del nuevo coronavirus.
 Los nombres de ambos guatemaltecos fueron mencionados durante el juicio el año pasado a Tony Hernández, hermano del presidente de Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández. Tony Hernández fue declarado por un jurado culpable de narcotráfico y espera ser sentenciado.
 Según un testigo de ese juicio, los Salguero estuvieron presentes en una reunión en Honduras en 2013 en la que supuestamente Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán entregó un millón de dólares en efectivo a Tony Hernández para financiar la campaña presidencial del actual mandatario hondureño.
 El testigo, Amílcar Alexander Ardón, dio detalles de la supuesta reunión y dijo que el dinero estaba en fajos de 50.000 y 100.000 dólares. El presidente de Honduras ha negado repetidamente las acusaciones.
 El viernes los fiscales del distrito sur de Nueva York dijeron que esperan que la cantidad de pruebas contra los Salguero sea “relativamente voluminosa”. Agregaron que tienen conversaciones interceptadas, aparatos electrónicos y pruebas de un juicio previo, entre otras evidencias a presentar.
 Las autoridades estadounidenses aseguran que a partir de 2004 los Salguero trabajaron junto a Tony Hernández y líderes del Cartel de Sinaloa para traficar cocaína. Con el objetivo de que avanzara por Honduras hacia Guatemala y México los acusados supuestamente pagaban sobornos a políticos hondureños, incluido Hernández. También ofrecían seguridad para los cargamentos.
 Las autoridades estadounidenses presentaron cargos contra los Salguero en diciembre.
 “Tras la reciente condena del excongresista hondureño Tony Hernández, los cargos de hoy son una prueba más de que incluso los narcotraficantes mejor conectados tendrán que rendir cuentas”, dijo entonces en un comunicado de la fiscalía Wendy Woolcock, agente a cargo de la agencia antidrogas estadounidense.
