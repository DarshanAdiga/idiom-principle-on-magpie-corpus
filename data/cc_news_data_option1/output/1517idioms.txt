The Lenovo Legion Y545 is one of the best gaming laptops you can get.
 It packs a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS display, a Core i7-9750H CPU, 16GB of RAM, 1TB HDD, a secondary 256GB SSD and a GTX 1660 Ti GPU with 6GB of graphics memory.
 In our Lenovo Legion Y545 review, we were impressed by its elegant design, comfy keyboard and great gaming performance.
 Design-wise, the Legion Y545's industrial design and clean, attractive lines present a nice contrast to many of its flashier counterparts. Its dark iron- gray aluminum lid has a similar appeal to an entry-level Mercedes-Benz or BMW.
 Weighing 5.3 pounds and measuring 14.2 x 10.5 x 1~1.1-inches, the Legion Y545 is just as heavy as the Dell G3 15 (2019) (5.3 pounds, 14.4 x 10 x 0.8 inches). It's slightly heavier and larger than the HP 15 Gaming Laptop 15 (4.9 pounds and 14.25.14 x 10.144 x 0.9 inches) and Asus ROG Zephyrus G GA502 (4.5 pounds, 14.4 x 9.9 x 0.8 inches).
 In real world testing, we watched the trailer for the Fast and Furious and the colors were vivid on the laptop's 15-inch 1080p anti-glare display. Explosions and high-speed chases were also clear and beautiful. As for gaming, the rendering when we played Grand Theft Auto 5 was buttery-smooth.
 In terms of sound, the Legion Y545's Harman/Kardon-tuned stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos software delivered excellent sound quality. The volume was loud enough to fill a small room with a good amount of bass for depth.
 Performance-wise, the gaming rig's 2.6-GHz 9th Gen Intel Core i7-9750H processor and 16GB of RAM never struggled. It even handled resource-draining Google Chrome while running 25 tabs, including one playing Avengers: End Game on Disney Plus with no hiccups.
 At $510 off, the Lenovo Legion Y545 is a solid buy if you're looking for an affordable gaming laptop to get you through quarantine. Lenovo's laptop sale ends soon, so act fast.

Secrets can be nearly impossible to contain, and such is the case with Hidden Pond Resort. After my visit to this secluded spot, tucked into a 60-acre pocket of Kennebunkport on the southern coast of Maine, wild horses couldn't keep me from dishing about my discovery.      Sure, I was already familiar with walkable downtown Kennebunkport. Its greenways and charming streets hold a special place in my heart. It feels like time travel to a town where people still stroll, couples walk hand in hand, and everyone greets each other.      I was shocked when my sister, Cheryl, who resides less than two hours south, confessed she'd never been there. In an instant, the idea to celebrate her upcoming birthday at Kennebunkport's much-acclaimed Hidden Pond was hatched.      Check-in at Hidden Pond takes place in a building nestled in the depths of a birch tree forest that was part of an old estate. Here, we were given a map of the property and pointed to the road where we'd find our accommodations, aptly named The Stargazer. We were impressed with this bi-level, two-bedroom, three bath cottage -- and even more impressed by its interior, with its screened porch, full kitchen and dining room, fireplaced living room and outdoor shower.      The bedrooms were equally luxurious, no quibbling necessary. We left our luggage in our respective rooms and headed back out to locate The Tree Spa, where pre-scheduled aromatherapy massages were calling our names. The surrounding beauty of nature distracted us from following our map, however, and we walked straight past Earth, Hidden Pond's critically raved-about restaurant. Once we backtracked our steps, we stopped inside the restaurant for direction. Inside, we admired its eclectic decor, and outside, the saltwater pool was inviting, and right behind the pool, voila ­-- the Tree Spa. Ensconced in treehouse-style massage rooms, we inhaled both the aroma of the pine trees outside and the lavender oil being expertly rubbed onto our skin.      Afterward, relaxed and rubbery, we called one of Hidden Pond's complimentary shuttles, with the goal of hitting happy hour at Hidden Pond's sister property, The Tides Beach Club.      The club's unobstructed view of Goose Rocks Beach and the crash of waves against the rocks mesmerized us as we sipped on a pair of watermelon Cosmos. Could it get any better? Why yes, it could, I realized as I tucked into a best-of-my-life Maine lobster roll, paired perfectly with a glass (or two) of chilled Chablis. The club's bar scene was lively, and we met a few patrons who said they'd returned to Hidden Pond twice, thrice or four times. This was not all that surprising.      Energized and not quite ready for the night to end, we stopped by the resort's communal firepit and indulged in s'mores, with all the luxury makin's ready for use, courtesy of Earth restaurant.      My sister is an early bird, and by the time I wandered downstairs from my blissful night's sleep, she had already dug into the coffee and pastries conveniently left on our doorstep. This was a "light" breakfast, but a heartier version is available at Earth.      We had a game plan for Cheryl's birthday and were soon on the road to Ricker Hill Orchards, a ninth-generation family farm about 60 minutes inland, to pick organic apples. Apple picking made us hungry, so we fueled up at Terry & Maxine's in the town of Turner. Their turkey and Swiss Rachel sandwich hit the proverbial spot.      Next stop, downtown Kennebunkport. As I'd hoped would happen, Cheryl was enchanted by the town and its unique shops, eateries and art galleries lining the charming streets.      Back at Hidden Pond, we headed to its garden shed, where we were encouraged to grab a vase and clip an arrangement of local wildflowers to grace the table at our cottage.      As the climax to this birthday weekend, I had arranged dinner for us at Earth. Our farm-to-fork meal featured an innovative menu created by Hidden Pond's Executive Chef Joe Schafer. It incorporated vegetables and herbs picked from Earth's on-site organic farm, freshly caught seafood and meats sourced from local purveyors.      No late-night s'mores for us this evening; we simply rolled back to The Stargazer cottage, flicked a switch, and chilled out by the gas fireplace for a while. We checked out the following morning, begrudgingly, as we longed to stay forever, hidden in the fold of Hidden Pond. Alas, it was time to return to real life.

Rodgers has led Liverpool to second in the Premier League table this season, with a brand of exciting attacking football that has seen them plunder 73 goals in just 28 matches - the highest number in the division.
 The Merseysiders are on course for a return to the UEFA Champions League after a four-campaign absence and, sitting just four points adrift of leaders Chelsea, are in contention to end their 24-year wait for a 19th top-flight title.
 Rodgers has attracted plaudits for his willingness to blood youngsters, with Raheem Sterling and Jon Flanagan now established members of the side and the likes of Joao Teixeira, Jordon Ibe and Brad Smith also making first-team appearances since his arrival from Swansea City in June 2012.
 And the Northern Irishman has explained that this policy is equally as vital to him as winning silverware.
 "There's no point in having a youth system and an academy system in place if you're not going to look from within," Rodgers told Liverpool's official website.
 "For me, it's how I work, it's also part of my definition of success.
 "When I eventually retire from football, I want to be able to look back and see that not only have I won trophies, but I've developed a football club that has brought through their own youth players and individuals and made them better. That is very important in my work.
 "Other managers may be different and might just be about purely winning trophies, but for me success isn't just about picking up the trophy at the end of the season.
 "It's also about the football club, giving value to young players and seeing them develop."
 Rodgers went on to insist Liverpool remain a work in progress, despite the huge strides forward the club has taken this season.
 "I've been satisfied in terms of the progress we have made but there is still a long way to go in terms of where I want to go with the whole project," he added.
 "We're recognised now as one of the most exciting teams in the country to watch, over the next 18 months we want to eventually be really challenging on the trophy front."

The new guidelines are aimed at easing restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, while holding the line in harder-hit locations. They make clear that the return to normalcy will be a far longer process than Trump initially envisioned, with federal officials warning that some social distancing measures may need to remain in place through the end of the year to prevent a new outbreak. And they largely reinforce plans already in the works by governors, who have primary responsibility for public health in their states.
 "You're going to call your own shots," Trump told the governors Thursday afternoon in a conference call, according to an audio recording obtained by The Associated Press. "We're going to be standing alongside of you."
 Places with declining infections and strong testing would begin a three-phase gradual reopening of businesses and schools.
 In phase one, for instance, the plan recommends strict social distancing for all people in public. Gatherings larger than 10 people are to be avoided, and nonessential travel is discouraged.
 In phase two, people are encouraged to maximize social distancing and limit gatherings to no more than 50 people unless precautionary measures are taken. Travel could resume.
 Phase three envisions a return to normalcy for most Americans, with a focus on identification and isolation of any new infections.
 Trump said recent trends in some states were so positive that they could almost immediately begin taking the steps laid out in phase one.
 "They will be able to go literally tomorrow," Trump said.
 The guidelines recommend that states pass checkpoints that look at new cases, testing and surveillance data over the prior 14 days before advancing from one phase to another.
 Governors of both parties made clear they will move at their own pace.
 Delaware Gov. John Carney, a Democrat, said the guidelines "seem to make sense."
 "We're days, maybe weeks away from the starting line and then you have to have 14 days of declining cases, of declining symptoms and hospital capacity that exists in case you have a rebound," he said.

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Gov. Kristi Noem on Friday said she is anxious to see businesses up and running in South Dakota, but it won't be on President Donald Trump's timeline. The Republican governor called guidance from the White House on reopening “helpful,” but said she “will still make decisions in South Dakota that's best for our state.” Trump is pushing states to quickly revive economic activity through a roadmap he sent to governors. Noem has projected infections to peak in mid-June. While she hasn't ordered businesses to close or issued a sweeping stay-at-home order, she stressed following precautions to curb infections for \"several more weeks.\" She said the state is already at Phase 1 of Trump’s plan, which calls for limited business activity. Health officials announced 101 new cases on Friday, bringing the state's total to 1,411. Over half of the cases in the state are tied to an outbreak at a Smithfield pork processing plant in Sioux Falls. They announced no new deaths, but seven people have died so far from COVID-19. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

Liverpool sit second in the Premier League ahead of Sunday's clash with fierce rivals Manchester United, who languish 11 points behind them in sixth.
 Rodgers' side can complete a league double over United with victory this weekend, but have not won at Old Trafford since their famous 4-1 triumph in March 2009.
 However, Liverpool are the Premier League's most prolific team this season and have earned emphatic wins over the likes of Arsenal, Tottenham and neighbours Everton over the last few months.
 And Fowler, who scored 183 goals in 369 appearances across two spells at Anfield, believes they can continue that trend this weekend.
 "It's always a massive game but the difference this time is that Liverpool must be favourites," Fowler told the _Liverpool Echo_.
 "I can't remember the last time a Liverpool team went to Old Trafford in that position.
 "On paper it's a game Liverpool should win. They're in great form and I am quietly confident Liverpool can get a big result there.
 "People talk about how far United have dropped but I also look at it from the other side - how far Liverpool have come.
 "That's testament to what Brendan has achieved so far. He has got the team playing so well and I think teams are starting to fear Liverpool again. The manager deserves a lot of credit for that."
 Conversely, Fowler considers United to be a team that no longer frightens opponents, even at home.
 "A few teams have gone to Old Trafford and got results this season," he added. "It has lost that fear factor. United had it for a number of years.
 "Teams went there knowing they would be on the back foot and almost expecting to lose. That's not happening anymore.
 "Now teams are actually pushing on looking to win there rather than sitting back, hoping to nick a point."

 "I've captained a few times for United and if the manager wants me to be captain, I'd have no problem with that," Rooney told club magazine _Inside United_.
 The England captaincy could also soon be up for grabs, should Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard elect to call time on his international career after this year's FIFA World Cup.
 And Rooney, who has captained his country twice in his 89 appearances to date, would also relish the chance to lead England on a full-time basis.
 "It'd be a great honour to captain my country but, again, it's the manager's call and I'm sure he'll have a few contenders," he added.

Another 13 people in Rhode Island have died from the coronavirus, bringing the total to 118, according to the Rhode Island Department of Health.
   
 The state also reports that 366 more people have tested positive for a total of 4,177.
   
 "We're still in the upswing here in Rhode Island. Our cases are still going up. Deaths are still going up. Hospitals are still going up," Governor Gina Raimondo said during her afternoon press briefing. "I hope that soon we can turn the corner and get on the down swing."
   
 Raimondo once again thanked the people of Rhode Island for following her social distancing guidelines. She said life isn't likely to get back to normal for a year, when treatments or a vaccine are developed.
   
 But, she said, if people stick with social distancing guidelines, she hoped to see improvement by May 8.
   
 "I feel that we are absolutely headed in the right direction, Raimondo said.
   
 "I feel we've done about as good a job as we could have in keeping everybody safe," Raimondo said.
   
 "I just want to say thank you and let you know I feel strong and confident and hopeful about what lies ahead," she said.
   
 Hospitals are treating 252 people, up from 245 announced Thursday, according to the state Department of Health's website. Sixty-two are in intensive care, with 43 on ventilators.
   
 Fourteen more people were discharged from hospitals, bringing the total number discharged to 196.
   
 A total of 30,761 people have now been tested, with 26,584 of them testing negative.
   
 Raimondo said the state has been preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. She's had a team working for five weeks on ensuring hospital capacity and says the state can handle a big surge, if needed. She said area hospitals have increased their capacity by a collective 250 percent.
   
 Within a couple of weeks, the state will have the capacity to add another 1,200 beds at field hospitals in Providence's Dunkin' Donuts Center and in Cranston.
   
 The state figures also show that Providence, which has the most cases in Rhode Island, has surpassed 1,000 positive cases, with 1093.

 “If we don’t win it within the next two years, I feel like it’ll be a massive failure to be honest,” she says, underlining the hunger not just within herself, but within the squad, to succeed.
 “The team that we have at the moment can easily win the Champions League. I think everyone knows that. With the depth that we have, we should be challenging. Hopefully we can finish the season this year, get in the top two spots, and then next year it’s all guns blazing really.”
 For Spence to add that title to her already-impressive CV would be yet another response to the critics that she has attracted over the years.
 The midfielder is Chelsea’s longest serving player, having joined the club back in 2008, and recently signed a two-year extension that will keep her at the club until 2022.
 However, despite being highly-rated within the club, especially by manager Emma Hayes, she has been an underrated member of that squad for many years by those on the outside.
 “I think it’s difficult for me because a lot of people always write me off. Every year, I’ve got to push myself,” she says. “I know there’s going to be signings coming in every year. Emma’s made that clear every season really, to make sure that the squad is pushing again and pushing to another level.

One of these "Shape" workouts suggests gathering whatever play balls you have around the yard and creating an obstacle course where you simply pick up and put down the balls over and over again. Doing this easy workout until all balls have been moved ten times provides a super way to build strength and endurance. Or create a fitness scavenger hunt where each yard landmark has a specific exercise to do that you and the kids can check off as movements are completed. Vary the challenges each time you do this, and you'll keep everyone on their toes.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A federal judge says he will rule before Monday on an emergency motion to allow abortions to continue in Tennessee in spite of a temporary ban on nonessential medical procedures to slow the spread of COVID-19. In a hearing by phone Friday, attorneys representing several state abortion clinics argued that Tennessee women will face immediate harm if the ban on abortions is not lifted. Alex Rieger, arguing for the Tennessee attorney general's office, said abortions are not being singled out but treated like any other procedure that is not necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury. Gov. Bill Lee issued an emergency order on April 8 banning those procedures for three weeks. The goal of the ban is to preserve the limited supply of personal protective equipment, or PPE, for doctors fighting COVID-19 and to help prevent the community spread of the disease by limiting patient-provider interactions, Rieger said. The two sides tangled over whether halting abortions would meet or undermine that goal. Genevieve Scott, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights, argued that all pregnant women need care. About 1 in 5 pregnant women require hospital visits before labor, and 15-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriages. Even those women without problems require prenatal care and tests. All of that requires providers to use personal protective equipment and interact with patients, Scott said. Rieger argued that most of what Scott described would take place a couple of months down the road and that \"every piece of PPE we use now is a piece that is not available when this disease reaches its peak.” Scott disputed that idea, saying the needs are immediate. She also noted that there is no guarantee the executive order will not be extended. . ..

BOSTON (AP) — A parent sentenced to six months in prison for participating in the college admissions bribery scheme is getting to go home early because of the coronavirus pandemic, a federal judge has ruled. Toby Macfarlane, a former real estate executive from Del Mar, California, will be released to home confinement after his lawyers argued the conditions behind bars put him at serious risk of contracting the virus. He will be released after he completes a 14-day quarantine in prison on April 21, U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton said this week. Macfarlane was sentenced in November after admitting to paying $450,000 to get his children into the University of Southern California as fake athletic recruits. Macfarlane was supposed to be released from prison on June 30. His lawyer said his client was told earlier this month that he would be transferred to a halfway house but first had to undergo a 14-day quarantine. Macfarlane was then taken to higher-security facility, where his lawyers say he has been confined 24 hours a day and had no change of clothes. The judge said Macfarlane's two-weeks in confinement is the equivalent of spending two months in the lower-security camp where he was serving. Therefore, the judge cut his sentence to time served and ordered him to remain in home confinement with electronic monitoring until June 30. An email was sent to Macfarlane's lawyer on Friday. Macfarlane is among nearly two dozen parents who have pleaded guilty in the case. Others include “Desperate Housewives” actress Felicity Huffman, who was sentenced to two weeks behind bars for paying $15,000 to have someone rig her daughter's entrance exam. Parents still fighting the case include “Full House” Actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo...

QUINCY -- Judy O'Connor hasn't seen her mother in more than two months due to the coronavirus pandemic, and she relies on phone calls with the staff at Hancock Park nursing home to convey how she's holding up.
 And while her 79-year-old mother seems healthy and well, O'Connor said she can't get straight answers about how many patients and staff members have come down with the insidious virus. She said she can't help but feel like the facility is doing far too little to protect residents like her mother and uncle, who also lives at Hancock Park.
 "They're all basically sitting ducks and all of us with family members that we love cross our fingers," O'Connor, of Quincy, said. "My main concern is how many people actually have it, and communication has been totally lacking."
 As the number of COVID-19 cases in long-term care facilities continues to grow, so does the worry and anxiety for families who feel helpless in protecting their loved ones from the disease. As of Thursday, the state reported 4,798 residents and workers at 232 long-term care facilities across the state have tested positive for the coronavirus. A total of 610 residents have died. The state is not releasing data on the number of cases in individual nursing homes or long-term care facilities.
 On Tuesday, Bane Care, which owns Hancock Park and 11 other nursing homes, started posted daily data about COVID-19 cases in each facility. Hancock Park had four residents and four staff members test positive as of Tuesday, but that number changed to zero residents and nine staff members by Thursday. The John Scott House in Braintree had 77 residents and 21 staff members confirmed to have the disease on Thursday.

 Hancock Park first started restricting visitors in February, a move that O'Connor said was proactive in stopping the spread of COVID-19. Yet some patients have since come down with the disease, suggesting that staff members or EMTs are unknowingly bringing it into the facility. O'Connor said she was told secondhand that two residents in her mother's wing of the nursing home have died, while some staff members tested positive.
 O'Connor said she hasn't gotten a straight answer about how patients are being quarantined, or how the staff plan to separate residents to stop the virus from being passed on.
 "God only knows how many people actually have it. There's no doubt in my mind that it spread up there, and it's going to spread like wildfire," O'Connor said. "The staff is very nice, but ginger ale and cookies aren't going to cure these patients."
 Emily Sugrue, a spokeswoman for Bane Care, said Hancock Park residents and staff are being monitored for symptoms of illness several times per day, and the facility is following best practices for handwashing and disinfecting hard services constantly, postponing communal activities and limiting the items that enter from outside.
 Sugrue said residents suspected of having COVID-19 are separated from non- infected residents, and residents are kept in their rooms with consistent staff assigned whenever possible. She said evidence that people can be asymptomatic and still contagious with COVID-19 creates unique challenges.
 "We are fighting desperately, and aggressively to manage this pandemic and are working incredibly hard to care for our residents while providing timely communication with families and staff," she said in a statement. "Our nurses and social workers are speaking with families as frequently as possible, while trying to focus on the care of the resident."
 Gov. Charlie Baker said the state has hundreds of nursing homes and assisted living or long-term care facilities, and it is "by far" the most difficult type of setting to deal with a contagious disease, due to the number of at- risk people and the way care is delivered. The state has 383 nursing homes, 255 assisted living residences and 93 rest homes that together serve about 57,500 people.
 "We were in fact one of the first states in the country to implement a no visitation policy, and many other states followed on that no visitation policy," Baker said. "In retrospect, we're really glad we did it because when we put that no visitation policy in place, most people weren't talking about the fact that significant portions of the population that actually gets infected and is in fact contagious are asymptomatic."
 On Wednesday, the Baker administration announced $130 million in new funding, expanded testing, and personal protection equipment distribution to support senior living facilities across the state. The governor also said that the state has hired a firm that specializes in nursing home crisis management to provide long-term care centers with on-site management and operational support, and assistance with staffing, vendors and implementing infection control measures.
 Marylou Sudders, the state's Secretary of Health and Human Services, said the state within the last few weeks has rolled out mobile teams staffed by trained personnel from the state National Guard to conduct on-site COVID-19 testing for nursing home residents. Bane Care requested such testing at the John Scott House in Braintree, where 75 residents and 16 staff members subsequently tested positive.
 More than 4,500 tests had been collected at 264 facilities as of Tuesday, according to the state, and 77 facilities had requested more than 8,600 test kits. As of Tuesday, 214 long-term care facilities had reported at least one case of COVID-19 and 3,907 residents or staff members had tested positive.
 Sudders said the state is looking at ways to increase staffing and access to personal protective equipment where necessary, as well as creating COVID-19 isolation spaces within existing facilities.
 "The staff and many other supports are coming in and out of the nursing home, so it's one thing to check temperatures, but people may be asymptomatic, so how is it that we can within a nursing home create COVID positive wings or areas, and then have non-COVID positive wings, and then have staff stay in those lanes, if you would, within those parts of the nursing home," Sudders said.
 Sudders said the state launched a hotline for families of nursing home residents to connect them with the appropriate state agencies. The line, 617-660-5399, is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week.
 O'Connor said she called the hotline herself, and was told the state would send epidemiologists out to any nursing homes that reported clusters of COVID-19. Hancock Park could also ask that the National Guard to come out to test all residents and patients.
 "Who has time for this bureaucratic process to play out when we are dealing with the most vulnerable population at the highest risk of mortality in the face of an exceptionally contagious disease that spreads like wildfire in facilities like these?" O'Connor said in an email.
 Ruth Jones, Quincy's health commissioner, said the National Guard has visited several of the city's nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the last few weeks to conduct testing. While originally officials recommended only testing symptomatic cases, those guidelines have been expanded to include all residents and staff.
 Jones said she feels most nursing homes are doing the best they can, given the challenging circumstances, including shortages of personal protective equipment and potential staffing impacts.
 "When you look at nursing homes, you have the highest risk population, many with multiple health issues going on, and even though you use the best infection control measures, this is a very transmissible virus," she said. "It's a tough issue throughout the state, and I'm not surprised we're seeing nursing homes in other cities having these issues."
 Even prior to this coronavirus outbreak, Jones said the state had protocols in place for how these facilities should handle outbreaks of communicable diseases. When a facility identified more than two cases, staff must notify the state, which will send out an epidemiologist to oversee the incident.
 Quincy Health and Rehabilitation Center on McGrath Highway had 75 residents who have tested positive for the coronavirus as of Wednesday, said Chris Walker, chief of staff to Quincy Mayor Thomas Koch.
 Steven Vera, CEO of Wachusett Healthcare, which owns Quincy Health and Rehabilitation Center, said in an email that the facility took the "unprecedented step" of requesting the National Guard to assist the Quincy facility in testing all residents.
 "We encourage the testing of all residents and staff at all skilled nursing facilities across the country," he said. "However, we are also aware that access to testing remains limited, and that such comprehensive testing remains challenging."
 Vera did not elaborate on how the facility is separating patients at this time, but said it is following all guidelines from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and state Department of Public Health's division of epidemiology regarding "cohorting of residents and staff."
 Vera said nursing homes across the country were already underfunded and understaffed, and the job requires close contact with a high volume of patients in close proximity, making it challenging to contain this pandemic. He said the Quincy team launched a nationwide search for protective gear to help with the effort.
 "Despite the unprecedented nature of this crisis, our staff and leadership team are working tirelessly to implement new, life-saving solutions," he said. "While the coming days and weeks will continue to present unprecedented and complex public health challenges, Quincy is confident its staff and leadership team are uniquely qualified to provide the highest level of care to all its residents."

I had most of the sky before me; a canopy of stars visible from my so-called deck observatory on the back of my house. So what grabbed my attention? A couple of little patches of sky straight ahead of me on the horizon, peeking between the tree line in the back of the neighbor's field.      No craning of the neck this time!      Some of you may be graced with a clear, wide-open sky where you can pan the flat horizon all the way around in a circle. You must be living in the middle of a Midwestern ranch, on a mountain top or on a houseboat out at sea! Of course, a lot more people in rural areas are fortunate to have a really low view in the sky in at least one direction, or more than one.      Dodging trees, hills and buildings can be a challenge.      On the other hand, seeing the stars, planets and moon among the tree branches, when empty of leaves, can be very picturesque as one takes an evening stroll.      From the convenience of my backyard deck, I was thrilled to gaze with binoculars at those small gaps. I saw stars!      What was thrilling was looking due south at night, I was seeing a hint of far southern constellations, ones that never fully rise above my horizon at my latitude. These stars are wrapped in an air of mystery, an enticing invitation to want to head far south, the farther the better, as I round the Earth and see the southern stars slide higher and higher in my sky. There is a whole region of sky anyone of us above (or below) the equator can never see.      Using my star atlas, I identified those low stars in the wood line gaps as the brighter stars of the constellation Vela the Sail.      There's a good chance you northerners (like me) know very little, or maybe nothing, of Vela the Sail!      On trips to Florida and Haiti, I have had chances to see stars of the Southern Cross; Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our Sun; and a few other constellations and notable stars I can't see at home. Yet, way below the equator, such wonders as Octans the Octant, Dorado the Swordfish, Mensa the Fly and Telescopium the Telescope await being traced and enjoyed. Folks Downunder may feel the same mystique about the Big Dipper, Little Dipper, Cassiopeia and Camelopardalis the Giraffe, far northern star patterns hidden from them.      Note, our view low to the horizon also means we are looking through a thicker layer of atmosphere. Just like the sun is dimmer and redder at sunset/sunrise, the stars are dimmed at night along the horizon. Light pollution from populated areas past the horizon can create a bright glow low in the sky.      There is also an interesting aspect of the low stars near the horizon. Thanks to the Earth's atmosphere acting like a lens, the starlight is refracted, and appears a little higher in the sky than it would if we had no air (like on the moon). That means starlight right below our flat horizon is bent and comes into view! Refraction also makes the setting and rising sun and moon distorted.      The atmosphere is most turbulent at low angles, causing a star to "twinkle" and cause poor telescopic views of planets just rising or setting.      Knowing your latitude, with the help of a good star chart you can find the limit of how far down the sky you can see from your home.      Meanwhile, enjoy brilliant Venus in the evening western sky. New moon is on April 22.      Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.
