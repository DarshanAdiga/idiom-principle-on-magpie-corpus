In the country that coined the term “bella figura” — the art of cutting a fine figure — hairdressers are deemed essential.
 “Italians really care about their image and about wellness,”″ said Charity Cheah, the Milan-based co-founder of TONI&GUY Italy. “Perhaps psychologically, the government may feel that going to a salon is a moment of release from stress and tension, a moment of self-care, that citizens need.”
 But across England people have had to scramble to get their hair done in the last days and hours while they still could, before new pandemic restrictions came into force on Thursday.
 “The thought of another lockdown and being stuck at home — (people thought) I’m going to throw caution to the wind and I am just going to come in and have my hair done,” said Richard Ward, managing director at the Richard Ward Hair and Metro Spa on London's swank Sloane Square.

And then there are life's finer pleasures.
 In France, the love of books is unquestioned. No country has more Nobel Prize- winners in Literature, and a book review program on TV like Apostrophes used to be watched by millions every week. But walk the streets of Paris and you will find bookshops closed.
 Sylvia Whitman, who runs the famed Shakespeare and Co. bookstore on the Left Bank, seethes at the prospect of giant online platforms gobbling up business while her shop is shuttered. Her sales have dropped 80% since the the spring lockdown.
 “I find it really tiring that the bigger you are the more you can ignore laws, you can avoid taxes, you can find loopholes," she said. “The smaller you are, the more expensive and the more complicated things are. “
 Across the border in Belgium, books were deemed essential. Even then, Wouter Cajot, owner of the 't Stad Leest in the port of Antwerp finds it a mixed blessing. The lockdown has reduced passing shoppers to a trickle and he will have to decide whether heating and personnel costs make it worth his staying open.
 But when essential goods cannot be bought in a store they can still be delivered.
 “During the first lockdown we had to invent a website in three days and nights," said Cajot, and he got “new logistical equipment — a cargo bike," to the delight of his Antwerp clients who get books delivered within hours of placing their order. “So why order books at an international online giant when the corner bookstore can deliver same-day by bike?"

Kirby Dach is becoming a professional bubble hockey player.
 After playing a prominent role in the Chicago Blackhawks upsetting the Edmonton Oilers in the Qualifying Series of the Stanley Cup playoffs in the Hub City, the Fort Saskatchewan native will be headed back into the bubble for a potential 51 days.
 Team Canada’s chances to defend their gold medal became decidedly better with Chicago GM Stan Bowman agreeing Thursday morning to loan Dach to the national program for almost two months if the NHL hasn’t returned to play by the end of the event.
 Only minutes before a virtual press conference to make the training camp announcement Wednesday, Team Canada at the 2021 IIHF World Junior in Edmonton improved dramatically.
 Hockey Canada had revealed a 46-member roster for a marathon training camp in Red Deer just prior to the media event that didn’t include either Dach or Alexis Lafreniere, the first overall pick in the recent NHL draft.
 Lafreniere is a possibility to join Dach on what will eventually end up as a 25-man roster instead of the usual 23 for the COVID-19 version of the tournament. Discussions are ongoing with the New York Rangers to have the star of the Hlinka-Gretzky tournament held in Rogers Place 15 months ago join the team as well.
 “I think Dach can bring leadership after a season with guys like Jonathan Toews. He’s been in the bubble as well to add that experience and that will be really helpful,” said Team Canada head coach Andre Tourignay. “He’s a great young player and a really good person so we’ll rely on him as a leader.”
 By the Christmas Day start to the Hub City bubble hockey version of the 2021 IIHF World Junior to held with no fans in the stands entirely in Edmonton, Team Canada expects to have a reasonable chance to be up to speed with the European players that have been playing with club teams.
 “I never coached a team of players that were off for seven months,” said Tourignay.
 He figures few teams have ever headed to a tournament with the same level of excitement or energy.
 “I’m dying every day to go back to the rink and the players are the same. Wednesday when we called them, I think if we told them it was 151 days in a bubble, not 51, I think we would have had them. They are excited. They want to play hockey.”
 He said it’s different than with the NHLers who were here before them.
 “It’s different when you are leaving a six-month old kid and a three-year-old kid and your wife and one of them sets sick and you’re in the bubble. That’s tough. I don’t think any of our players have a three-month-old kid, a three- year-old kid or a wife.
 “These guys have trained for six or seven months now. Kirby Dach played less than a month in the last seven months for the Chicago Blackhawks. Ask him if he wants to play hockey. It’s the same thing for everybody.”Hockey Canada announced, along with the list of 46 players invited to attend, the plan for a marathon training camp to be held in Red Deer that will be extended with a trip up the QEII to enter the bubble with the nine other teams in Edmonton.The Red Deer camp will run from Nov. 16 to Dec. 13.The Central Alberta city was originally to play host to Group B round-robin games in the 2021 tournament but due to the coronavirus pandemic, following the almost flawless start-to- finish presentation of the NHL’s Stanley Cup playoffs in Edmonton’s Hub City bubble, it was decided to hold the entire tournament in Rogers Place. The Edmonton-Red Deer combination will return for a planned normal World Junior with sold out crowds.Inviting now 47 players to camp invites was complicated by the fact that both WHL and OHL seasons have been pushed back until after the Dec. 25-Jan 5 tournament.
 “It’s a unique year for all of us and a major challenge,” said Scott Salmond, Hockey Canada senior vice president of national teams.
 This camp is going to have some evaluation to it. Normally we’d have evaluated the players at the start of their seasons with their club teams.
 We haven’t had that opportunity.
 “We’ll start by evaluating. We’ll use some intra-squad games to be able to do that. We’ll reduce the number of players somewhere in the first week to 10 days. We’re in discussion with our partners at USports to play six games,” he said of the preparation prior to the two pre-Christmas games against Sweden and Russia in Rogers Place.
 The players headed to Red Deer include five goaltenders, 15 defencemen and 26 forwards. A total of 18 OHL, 15 WHL, 9 QMJHL and 4 US college players are headed to Red Deer for the Nov. 17 to Dec. 13 camp at the home of the WHL Red Deer Rebels. All but five players have already been drafted.
 Among the 47 players are six returnees who won gold in the Czech Republic last year — Bowen Byram, Dylan Cozens, Jamie Drysdale, Quinton Byfield, Connor McMichael and Dawson Mercer.
 With Dach involved and likely Lafreniere on deck, they’ll be viewed by many as the supporting cast.

From Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, 2020, Fort Saskatchewan residents who sign up for e-billing will be entered for a chance to win one of two prize draws for a $250 credit on their January utility bill. Prizes will be drawn on January 6, 2021 and winners will be privately notified.
 The City of Fort Saskatchewan says there are many benefits and reasons for residents to Go Paperless.
 "The first and foremost being the reduction of waste," said Trish Norman, Revenue Services Coordinator for the City of Fort Saskatchewan. "Waste reduction is a big priority for us, along with the fact that it offers residents a contactless way to receive their bill. The reduction to the printing and mailing costs of these paper bills would benefit the City as a whole."
 Residents can make the switch to e-billing and enter themselves into the draw by going to fortsask.ca/ebilling and completing an online form. Residents that are already signed up for e-billing will be entered into the draw automatically.
 "We're hoping that people will get on on board with this new initiative and help us in reducing not only the costs, but the environmental impact of printing and mailing bills every month."

Habitat for Humanity and Dow are coming together to present the 2020 Women Build fundraiser. The fundraiser will take place from Oct. 27 - Dec. 14, 2020. Due to Covid restrictions, this year's fundraiser will be held entirely online. Habitat for Humanity aims to raise $100,000 to help local families become home-owners and to build stronger communities.
 The theme of this year's fundraiser is _Women Empowering Women,_ which Melinda Noyes, chief strategic engagement and programs officer for Habitat for Humanity Edmonton, says is an important value of her organization.
 "At least half of the habitat partner families that we have are single moms," said Noyes. "So the idea of women building this home for a mom to be able to provide a foundation and a hand-up for a mom and her children is significant. Women contributing to the success of other women is important. We all need a hand up and for women to give other women a hand up is pretty special."
 The project that this year's fundraiser will be supporting is the construction of a home in Edmonton's Hollick Kenyon community. Construction on the project is currently underway and is expected to be completed and have a family move in by spring 2021.
 "Habitat is building the house and the land was donated by the City of Edmonton. Our Habitat construction crew is working on the house now. I was out there today and there are already walls up, it's really exciting."
 Residents interested in getting involved with the fundraiser can visit HFH.org/womenbuild. Each fundraising individual or team will have a personal fundraising page on CanadaHelps.org to share with your network and track your goal. Each participant that reaches the $1000 goal will receive a Women Build T-shirt, as well as a custom designed charm from Hillberg & Berk.
 This year's presenting sponsor of Women Build is Dow through their Women's Inclusion Network (WIN). Dow has been a proud supporter of Habitat for Humanity's work since 1983, and has stepped up to become presenting sponsor of Habitat Edmonton's Women Build for 2020.
 "I am proud to see our WIN employee resource group work with Habitat to help families build strength, stability and independence," said Cat Garcia, Dow's Women's Inclusion Network leader in Alberta. "We know that when we invest in women, we are setting a path for equality and inclusive economic growth in our local communities."
 Women Build has traditionally consisted of 150 women coming together to construct walls, floors, stairs and other items in Habitat's Prefab Shop. This year, due to the pandemic, Women Build will be entirely online, but that hasn't changed the meaning behind the initiative.
 "The only real change this year is being on site, you can't actually wield a hammer this year and in other years you could," said Noyes. "It is one of the unfortunate realities of Covid, but we don't want to let it stop us from supporting the event and supporting a potential partner family, especially single mothers, from owning a home. We're not just raising money, we're raising a home."
 This event would not be possible without the generous support of DOW.
 "Habitat's Women Build event has been running since 2015 and participants have raised $589,000 to serve families," said John Caputo, Interim President & CEO, Habitat for Humanity Edmonton. "We are thankful to continue to have Dow's support and to have their WIN employee resource group volunteer with us. In the last five years, their employees have volunteered close to 2,000 hours to help build Habitat homes in Alberta."

The conspiracy theory-mongering extends to the highest ranks of the party's congressional leadership. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) claimed on Fox that the election results were corrupted by fraud and that Trump was the real victor.
 "President Trump won this election," he told Laura Ingraham. "Everyone who is listening, do not be quiet, do not be silent about this. We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes. We need to unite together."
 Likewise, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, went on Fox and claimed the election had been rigged and that he was making a hefty donation to the president's legal fund to stop it.
 "Everything should be on the table," Graham replied when Hannity asked him if the Pennsylvania state legislature should "invalidate" the results. "Philadelphia elections are crooked as a snake," he added.
 Potential 2024 GOP presidential candidates are also getting into the action. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) used a Fox appearance to falsely claim poll watchers had been denied access in Philadelphia, and call the results into question.
 "What we've been seeing the last three days is outrageous. It is partisan, it is political, and it is lawless," he told Hannity. "I am angry and I think the American people are angry because by throwing the observers out, by clouding the vote counting in a shroud of darkness, they are setting the stage to potentially steal an election not just from the president, but from the over 60 million people across this country who voted for him all across this country."
 Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), another 2024 contender, similarly undermined confidence in the election results.
 "We've seen reports of Detroit about ballots brought in there, new ballots in the middle of the night. And we've seen it in Philadelphia," he told Fox's Tucker Carlson. "Now, again, to your point a second ago, I don't know if these allegations are well founded or not."
 Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House and longtime Fox contributor, is what passes for a GOP elder statesman. He went on _Hannity_ to claim that "you are watching an effort to steal the presidency of the United States" and to call on Attorney General William Barr to arrest election workers.
 The party's newest elected officials are doing the same thing. On Friday morning, Michelle Fischbach, a newly minted Republican representative-elect from Minnesota, was on _Fox & Friends_ claiming that Trump "did win" but Democrats "didn't win the votes of the American people, they're just finding votes at this point."
 Trump's personal affinity for Fox gave the network an unrivaled influence on his administration. But even if he is defeated, Fox's hold on his party seems unlikely to diminish. Politicians who want to gain and hold power within the GOP know that the network's airwaves provide one of their best opportunities to accomplish that and so they're willing to play ball with its conspiracy theories, no matter how damaging they are to the country.
 Senior Republican officials are "privately" worried that the president's attacks on the country's democratic system are dangerous, according to the Associated Press. But in public, they're going on Fox and backing him to the hilt, no matter the cost.

We have to ask a bunch of judges, 'Judges, we need to really observe what’s going on in there. We’re entitled to observe this count. You make them. You make them let us in.'

"We certainly hope the results allow us to get back quickly to practice," Tyra said. "But if we see a spread inside or outside the locker room, we may have to extend that period that we planned to pause. It's touch and go, but we're hopeful we'll be back in meetings Sunday or Monday."
 Tyra termed the players' symptoms are "very mild."
 UofL coach Scott Satterfield said Saturday that there was discussion about whether to postpone the Virginia Tech game, but the coaches decided they had sufficient personnel to go ahead and play. The Cardinals lost 42-35.
 "The kids want to play," Tyra said. "We've learned that from other teams in the league. They all want to play and we certainly want to support that, but you've got to make these decisions as best you can on the fly. Nobody's expert on how to dictate the numbers. We're taking shots at it, but feel we made a good decision today and the bye week avails an opportunity for both teams to get healthy."
 Players won't be allowed into the football complex the rest of the week except to pick up meals.

Eta, once a powerful Category 4 hurricane, weakened to a tropical depression Wednesday, but is still bringing heavy rains and life-threatening flooding to parts of Central America on Friday, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm set off mudslides in Nicaragua and Honduras and is believed to have killed dozens of people.

Colbeck noted, "The poll workers themselves are fairly cooperative; they just want to do the right thing. But some of the chief election officials seemed to be intent on interfering with actual oversight activities of our officials, which is blatantly against the law. And that interference did not start on election day, November 3 - it started well before that."

Georgia's election laws stipulate that if a candidate doesn't get over 50 percent, it goes to a runoff. Both of Georgia's Senate seats were up for grabs this year because former GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned in late 2019 due to health reasons. The special election was little more than a Republican primary between establishment favorite Sen. Kelly Loeffler and conservative-backed Rep. Doug Collins. Loeffler won (more's the pity) and will go on to face the Democrat candidate, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, in the January runoff.

Trump kept, too, more on than off, as his most indispensable political adviser Roger Stone, a Cohn protege, a self-styled agent provocateur whose “rules” read like the playbook of a shameless cynic. Always attack. Never defend. Nothing’s on the level. The most powerful human motivator is not hope and love but hate. Better to be infamous than anonymous. Stone has always been interested not in government but in politics. Politics as a tool to divide — not unite. Politics as “performance art” — because the only thing worse than “being wrong” is “being boring.”

Tally-Foos said the current Barnett Street entry to the assembly hall will stay, while they plan signage, stonework and other design elements to denote the new main entry doors.
 Inside the building, further west the two former school classrooms will remain in the same place, with upgrades including raised ceilings and better lighting, for use by programs in the building. And a new women’s restroom will be placed across that hall, plus three separate office spaces.
 She said they plan to build a new canopy outside over the west door.
 “We are planning for the functionality of 2020 but with aspects of the heritage of the building. People will see purple accents in some paint and tiles, the school colors of the Doyle School.”
 Medical/Transportation
 Last spring, using the organization’s BUILD Grant, Robyn Pipkin joined the staff part-time as a family nurse practitioner in family medicine. She also is certified as an emergency nurse.
 She is one of two proposed medical personnel, assigned through Peterson Health, who will be working with neighborhood patients who come to the health clinic at the Doyle Center. To make an appointment at the Doyle health clinic, call 258-7900.
 With the continuing partnership with Kerr Konnect, staff and volunteers are offering rides to various destinations for neighborhood residents, including doctor’s offices. They have at least one driver on staff, and last May they took delivery of a vehicle that belongs to the Hope for Health program to continue that service.
 Fundraising
 Katie Givens is “Project Manager” for Hope for Health at the Doyle Center.
 The total renovation budget for the building is $1,129,744, based on board discussions.
 Lois Shaw is Doyle Community Center facility manager; and Clifton Fifer Jr., community outreach coordinator for the center.
 Givens can be contacted by email at hfh.katieg@newhopecounselingtx.org; or by phone at 377-8035. The Doyle Center is located at 110 W. Barnett St.
 ‘BUILD Health
 Challenge Award’
 In partnership as “The Hope for Health Collaborative,” $250,000 in funding and resources was received to support the work of seven cooperating entities, including New Hope, Peterson Health, Texas Department of State - Region 8, Barnett Chapel and Glory Community Garden, City of Kerrville, and the Doyle Community Center.
 With their community partners, Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, Schreiner University, Raphael Free Clinic, Peterson Community Clinic, Families and Literacy, Kerr Konnect, and Light on the Hill at Mount Wesley, they are working on revitalization of the Doyle neighborhood.
 A required community match is provided by Peterson Health in the form of clinic services, screenings, health education, and other “in-kind” services.
 Current Doyle programs may include, after the COVID-19 threat is passed, but are not limited to, after-school and summer kids’ club; community gatherings such as Blue Santa; adult educational programs such as GED tutoring, and evening family programs.
 Tally-Foos leads a 10-member board of directors, aided by an eight-member advisory board.
 They are still accepting donations, and raising funds to match a $175,000 challenge grant for playground and pavilion improvements. She said sustainability in the future must be insured, so next they target future staff and operations money, and a new endowment fund.
 Tally-Foos has a personal interest there, as her mother Jean H. Tally was one of two teachers in the school building until about 1982, and Kay spent many after-school hours there. “Public-school kindergarten was mandated for economically disadvantaged students when I was 10. My parents were friends of Tom Daniels and other educators here then. Mom taught with Linda Seymour. It was a vacant building and they got to outfit activity centers for the students. Mom was ‘lead teacher’ here about 10 years, with no principal onsite. She knew everybody.”

HALLE, Belgium (AP) — In times when a pandemic unleashes death and poverty, the concept of what is essential to keep society functioning in a lockdown is gripping Europe.
 Beyond the obvious — food stores and pharmacies — some answers in the patchwork of nations and cultures that make up Europe can approach the surreal. What is allowed on one side of a border can be banned just a brief stroll down the road, on the other.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that while it might seem fairest to just shut everything down, “it's perhaps not the most practical” solution.
 “If people are only satisfied when everything possible is shut down, then that’s a view which naturally doesn’t make economic sense,” Merkel said.
 That's why Germany is keeping car dealerships open this time, after their closure in the first, spring lockdown hurt the country's huge automobile industry.
 In Belgium, of course, chocolate shops are staying open.
 “Chocolate is very much an essential food around here," said chocolatier Marleen Van Volsem at the Praleen chocolaterie south of Brussels. “It has to be. Because chocolate makes you happy."

"As we have discussed at the bilateral meeting, our country will remain firmly committed to all initiatives and efforts to ensure the 360-degree approach to deterrence and security, at the Allied and EU levels, and I am convinced that together, even if Portugal is on one side of Europe and Romania on the other, we have found and will continue to find common lines of interest, availability to effort. And in this way we can show that there is a desire to contribute together to everything that the security effort at the level of the North Atlantic Alliance and the EU means, and especially to the effort that each of our armies makes to give the citizens the confidence that we are able and we have the necessary training to ensure our countries' security and safety," Ciuca underlined.
 He added that one of the main topics addressed during the talks with his Portuguese counterpart was the signing of a protocol between the Romanian Air Force and Aerostar Bacau regarding the modernization of the F-16 aircraft.
 "We will modernize all F-16 aircraft. And because we aimed at materializing the investment in defense in the national defense industry, as well, I would like to mention that this program will continue and end with a stage in which we will modernize all F16 aircraft. This will be carried out through the transfer of technology and know-how, to Aerostar Bacau, something that will mean a very important element in the future process of operation and maintenance of F-16 aircraft. In this regard, a protocol was signed by the Romanian Air Force and AEROSTAR that will involve all the industrial cooperation projects. This was one of the main topics I addressed with my Portuguese counterpart," said the Minister of Defense.
 Other topics that were addressed in the bilateral talks focused on the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, security in the Black Sea region, defense and deterrence measures on the eastern flank or the initiation of steps regarding the expansion of bilateral decision-making, including in the field of defense industry.
 "We had discussions that also referred to the pandemic situation we have been going through for several months now, and we also shared the experience and the way in which the Romanian Army - especially the lines of military medicine - got involved in support of central and local authorities. We have also discussed the security situation at the level of the Black Sea region, the security situation in a 360-degree approach at the level of NATO and the EU. Topics that could constitute bilateral or multilateral cooperation programs both within the EU and at the Allied level were also addressed. Portugal is committed to participating in our country's initiatives to strengthen defense and deterrence on the eastern flank. Thus, we have Portuguese soldiers at the NATO Force Integration Units, at the Multinational Brigade (...). It was also discussed the initiation of steps regarding the extension of the bilateral decision-making, including in the field of the defense industry. In this sense, too, we agreed that, in the next period, we should have an agenda at the level of the specialized structures," Nicolae Ciuca detailed.
 The program of the Portuguese delegation's visit included official discussions at the Ministry of National Defense headquarters, during which the two defense ministers addressed issues related to the state of Bilateral Defence Cooperation, with emphasis on issues related to the implementation of the procurement contract of the F-16 aircraft from the Portuguese side, cooperation in NATO and EU format, in the current security context, with emphasis on the allied deterrence and defense posture, as well as on cooperation within the projects of Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) initiative.

The scourge would have been a singular challenge for any president. Trump’s response, though, was pointedly misguided and mangled by his own pathological worries about the appearance of weakness. With few exceptions, Trump minimized the threat of the virus all along, disregarding the early warnings of advisers; telling the public it would be “just fine”; likening the pathogen to the flu when in fact he knew it was “deadly stuff”; insisting it was “dying out” and “fading away” and that it would “like a miracle” “disappear”; presiding over faltering testing, contact tracing and procurement of protective equipment; shifting the onus of the task as well as blame for failures to states and their governors and China; undercutting the credibility of public health agencies and officials; rarely wearing a mask to model helpful behavior and defying other best practices to keep himself and others safe; staging crowded rallies after the onset of the outbreak and beginning them again well before it had subsided; agitating for schools, churches, bars and other entities to “open up”; pushing treatments and medicines not recommended or approved and at one point floating the notion of a potential remedy of an injection of household disinfectant. Even as Covid-19 wreaked unremitting havoc on the nation he was elected to lead, infecting millions of Americans, killing hundreds of thousands, staggering the economy and upending nearly all aspects of life, the lifelong devotee of Norman Vincent Peale and the tenet of the “power of positive thinking” gave himself A-plus grades.
