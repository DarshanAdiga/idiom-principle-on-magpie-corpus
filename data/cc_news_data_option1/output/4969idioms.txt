“In Iowa, we will distribute a portion of this allocation for their workforce and to our long term care facilities,” Reynolds said. “The federal government has developed a long term care/pharmacy partnership to help administer the vaccine in facilities. This will allow us to quickly and efficiently vaccine our most vulnerable population first in communities across the state.”


  Reynolds and Kelly Garcia, Director of Iowa Department of Human Services, noted that life will not return to normal immediately, the news brought a sense of a “light at the end of the tunnel.” Updates between the federal and state government will be made as they are made available. Garcia stated 39 locations for the Pfizer vaccine are currently established to hold the vaccine, which requires cold temperatures for storage. More locations are being established across Iowa. The vaccine requires two doses 21 days apart. The Moderna vaccine is also taken in two doses 28 days apart and does not require as cold of temperatures for storage.


  “As more COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, additional populations will be added and more people will be able to receive the vaccine,” Garcia said. “We anticipate by mid 2021, there should be enough vaccine available for anyone who wants to receive it.”


  Garcia noted that while transparency is key in informing the public of the availability of the vaccine, availability in specific locations for vaccine positioning will not be available to ensure safety of distribution. This is a developing story and Vinton Newspapers will have updates as they are made available.

The highly anticipated final season of Attack on Titan is set to return, even if its not this fall like originally planned. The trailer left fans excited and curious about new characters joining this amazing story. One face (and body) that had everyone's attention was the main protagonist Eren Jaeger. Eren has overcome life-changing obstacles such as transforming into a titan and learning the secrets hidden from the world by his father. His growth as a character is extraordinary and has been the guiding force of many events in the series. Allow me to be your guide through Eren's journey of becoming humanity's hope. It's time to see how Attack on Titan concludes, and why following Eren's story has been such a fantastic treat.

Eren spiraled into self-hatred after this revelation and was willing to surrender his life to Historia to atone for his father's actions. He fell victim to the words Rod Reiss was spreading and felt his sacrifice was necessary for the greater good when it would actually prolong humanity's struggle against the titans. Thankfully, Historia refuses to turn into a titan and encourages Eren to keep fighting. After being rescued by their friends from the 104th Cadet Corps, Historia took her rightful place as queen after a well-planned coup d'etat was executed by Commander Erwin to overthrow the imposter king. This historic change brought with it the transparency that the first king denied his people for his version of peace. In continuing his efforts to be humanity's hope, Eren endured intense training to master his new hardening ability to be ready for the vital mission to retake Wall Maria.

If university was a game of chess, then students - cast as the pawns - have been thrust into a seemingly continuous state of check-mate, materialised in the constraining metal edifices around the places we’re supposed to feel safe in. This seems especially fitting considering how much the University is trying to charge us for them. I’d call it daylight robbery, but that would involve actually being able to see any natural light from my ground floor room. Much like a game of chess, in which university is somehow both the king and the queen, possessing the freedom to move anywhere on the board, they seem to have forgotten that we student pawns vastly outnumber these authority figures and more so that it is not one single game but rather a tournament. One in which we will relentlessly persist, round after round after round. If the University wants to toy with our mental health and make our education an overpriced game, well then, let’s play.

“Even at soccer games where there are mostly adults, there are a few kids waiting for you,” Scheel said. “They wanted a high-five or a hug and their faces would just light up. That was the highlight of every single event.”


  But wearing the mascot costume is not as easy as it seems. Scheel stated it was challenging to look forward through the costume without having to tilt the head up towards the sky. She mainly had to tilt the head down. The massive feet of the costume made getting up stairs difficult, and Scheel can recall tripping on several occasions.


  As TC Panther, Scheel was also sworn to secrecy about her true identity. It was a tradition for the mascot. Only her parents, her fiance and a select few friends were aware Scheel was TC. The secrecy stays that way until graduation. Due to COVID-19, a traditional commencement was out of the question. Instead, a virtual graduation was recently held for the students. Scheel revealed herself by wearing the mascot’s feet in a photo for the virtual ceremony.


  “My parents are the biggest supporters in my life,” Scheel said. “They were there for my first event as TC Panther and there for my last. It was actually harder for them to keep it a secret than it was for me.”


  Scheel is now preparing for student teaching and she is leaving her “home away from home” after nearly five years in Cedar Falls. She admitted the transition from high school to college had been difficult initially, but credited joining the marching band and eventually becoming the mascot as ways she finally became comfortable and at ease at UNI.


  “I really got to show my genuine pride for UNI in this role,” Scheel said. “There was never an event I was not excited to go to as TC Panther. This is something I’m going to look back at and feel sentimental for years to come. I’m truly grateful for the opportunity.”


  Scheel is the daughter of Randy and Teresa Scheel of Garrison. She is a 2016 graduate of Vinton-Shellsburg High School.

According to a Moody’s Analytics and Morning Consult survey the covid-19 pandemic has impacted gender wage gap in US, reports Bloomberg. More women than men said they have less power to ask for a pay raise or benefits in light of the pandemic, indicating that the coronavirus has entrenched the gender disparity in wage bargaining. Women of all races and income groups are less likely to bargain for raises than men, according to the institutions’ survey of 5,000 U.S. adults in mid-September. About 15% of women said they were more willing to ask for raises due to the impact of the virus, compared with 20% of men. Workers who lost income but not jobs were found to be more reluctant to engage in bargaining. For women who were able to remain in the labor force, the lack of bargaining power means they’ll be less likely to enjoy wage gains even when labor demand strengthens as the economy recovers.

Joining the Scout Regiment has always been Eren's dream. Discovering the world outside the walls motivated Eren to look up to the Scouts who risked their lives for the people. His drive became an obsession the day the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan destroyed Eren's childhood home in Shiganshina. After watching the horrendous act of his mother being devoured, Eren made a vow to become a Scout to slay every titan alive. Due to his grit and determination, Eren was able to graduate and become a part of the military faction he idolized as a child. Ironically, he became a member of the famous Captain Levi squad after discovering his ability to transform into a titan. With this new ability, Eren's life was in the hands of the top military executives. They debated whether to dispose of Eren for humanity's safety or use him as a weapon. Thankfully, with the help of Erwin, a decision was reached for Eren to remain in the military. However, strict guidelines were put in place, which dictated how Eren was to be treated and deployed moving forward. These orders were a preview of the government's controlling nature inside of the walls, which would eventually become one of the leading drivers of progression for the entire story.

Nobody needs a study to tell them being a single parent is tough.      "This is a group of people who are kind of carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders, right?" said Dr. Natalie Stokes, a cardiology fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. "You're taking care of kids. You're trying to provide for your family."      Hoping to shed new light on the toll single parenthood takes on heart health, Stokes and her colleagues recently analyzed a federal health survey of 2,180 parents, which included 462 single parents, a quarter of whom were single men.      Researchers looked at seven heart health indicators - such as blood pressure, obesity, diet and whether the person smoked - and rated the parents on a 14-point scale. The single-parent group scored about half a point lower than the partnered parents. And single mothers scored almost a full point lower than mothers with partners.      The research, which is considered preliminary until published in a peer- reviewed journal, was presented last month at the American Heart Association's virtual Scientific Sessions conference.      Even after adjusting for age, race, existing medical conditions, poverty and more, the single-parent group was 1.31 times more likely to be rated as having below-ideal cardiovascular health.      While her study didn't pry into the reasons behind the discrepancy, Stokes hopes to explore that in future work.      The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the U.S. had 10.4 million single-parent households in 2019. Those numbers, and previous research, make single parenthood a potentially significant public health concern.      An international study in 2016 found that being a lone working mother predicted a higher risk of heart disease and stroke among women in the United States. In the early 2000s, researchers who tracked Swedish women for up to 20 years found that single mothers had greater odds of dying during the study period than women who had partners. And a Canadian study in 2016 found single fathers were three times more likely to die during the study's decade-long follow-up than single mothers or partnered fathers.      But Stokes emphasized her work should not be viewed as pointing to a problem caused by single parents. She'd rather focus on using it to make society more responsive to their needs.      Dr. Gina Lundberg, clinical director of the Emory Women's Heart Center in Atlanta, agreed.      "It takes a village to raise a kid, right? Well, your village is already really small if you're a single parent," Lundberg said. She was not involved in the new research but offered firsthand knowledge of life in a single-parent household.      "I think the study supports what we suspected all along: It's very stressful to be a single parent. Single parents have less time for their own health because there's no one to offload the sharing of responsibilities to. So, they tend to do more for their kids and neglect themselves.   "That's certainly what I witnessed," she said. "My father died when I was 14." Her mother raised her and her sister.      Before her father died, Lundberg remembers her mother making regular medical appointments. After his death, "I can't remember her going to the doctor at all. And I think there just wasn't time."      Lundberg, who also is an associate professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine, had several ideas for how health care providers could be more accommodating.      "I think we've got to have some options to make things more flexible for these parents," she said.      Family care providers, for example, might offer appointments where parents and children could get their checkups at the same time. "Maybe on Saturday morning, when the kids aren't in school." And OB-GYNs could offer appointments for women to have bloodwork, blood pressure, breast and general physical exams done during a single visit.      Stokes said although her study's findings were just a starting point for understanding what single parents need, physicians could use the information as a prompt to consider their patients' life situation in deciding their care.      Doctors need to be allies with their patients in overcoming barriers to care, she said.      "The onus shouldn't be on the individuals," Stokes said. But patients can help by being open about their struggles, and by speaking up when necessary. "Maybe more aggressively early on saying … 'I was made aware that this might put me at increased risk. What types of things should I be doing?'"      Lundberg also said society needs to stop stigmatizing single parents.      They come from all kinds of income levels, education levels and ethnic backgrounds. It's mothers as well as fathers. And whether they started out as single parents or became one because of the death of a spouse, they deserve support, she said.      "I think we need to be doing more to realize they're stressed, it's affecting their health, and they need our help."
