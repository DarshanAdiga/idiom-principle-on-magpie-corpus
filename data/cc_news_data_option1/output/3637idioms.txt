The Bolts turned it around and beat the Camels 15-6 for the match.
 Despite the outcome, CCHS coach Marcy Befus said the intensity and competitiveness shown Thursday is something both teams will have to get used to going forward.
 ‚ÄúI think the kids always get a little bit more geared up (when playing Thunder Basin),‚Äù Befus said. ‚ÄúThat first game they came out wound up and they were all over the place with excitement and adrenaline and some nerves.‚Äù
 Having two schools in one community can lead to intense matchups, said Thunder Basin coach Wenett Martin.
 ‚ÄúI think every time you have that cross-town rivalry it‚Äôs just tough,‚Äù Martin said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the beauty of having two high schools in the same town.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great atmosphere and you know every time we play the Camels it‚Äôs going to be tough and they‚Äôre going to bring it and you just hope that in the end you‚Äôre able to pull off a W, and that‚Äôs what we did.‚Äù
 The atmosphere was one Campbell County freshman Sydnee Streitz had never seen before Thursday.
 ‚ÄúAs a freshman, I‚Äôve never really had a legit student section that actually gets pumped up for you,‚Äù Streitz said about the fans cheering both teams on. ‚ÄúI definitely enjoyed it. I loved the energy and the school spirit that we can bring into these games.‚Äù
 Campbell County senior Taylor Fischer said the Camels tried to use the student section to its advantage.
 ‚ÄúEvery time we play (Thunder Basin) our intensity is way higher than it usually is but the atmosphere was crazy,‚Äù Fischer said. ‚ÄúIt was so loud and everybody was excited.‚Äù
 Though it was a home game for the Camels, Thunder Basin brought its own student sections to CCHS to watch the two teams square off.
 ‚ÄúIt shows you how much we are together as a school. At Thunder Basin we really pride ourselves in our students and supporting each other,‚Äù Bolts junior Hannah Durgin said. ‚ÄúIt shows the atmosphere of our school and of Campbell County students coming in and supporting their teams as well.‚Äù
