"Maybe we mentally and physically were a bit drained because we had to push things to the end.
 "We had a lot of injuries and everything fell apart."
 Many observers believe the turning point in Carvalhal's reign was their 4-2 humbling at home to neighbours Sheffield United in September.
 Loovens said: "I was injured at the time.
 "I think at one point we had 11-12 players injured and they were probably 10 that had played most of the season before so it is tough to replace that.
 "Nobody gets injured on purpose; it was just one of those freaky things that happens once in a blue moon.

I was 50 in November. It was one of those milestone birthdays that makes you sit down and take stock, not that I really needed an excuse to sit down. And that was the problem. With age and various ailments had come inactivity and with inactivity had come weight gain. It wasn’t the kind of weight gain that would make me the subject of a documentary, more the kind of creeping and depressing type that sees you reach for the baggiest clothes in your wardrobe, suck your cheeks in photographs and keep your shirt on even if it’s the hottest day of the year.

A popular Iowa college town offers visitors a peaceful, quiet visit with interesting things to do and great pizza.      Grinnell is home to Grinnell College, which adds to the comfortable and inviting feel of this city of just over 9,000 residents. It is a place where visitors can walk the streets, shop, eat and enjoy the friendly, laid-back atmosphere.      Grinnell is known as the Jewel of the Prairie, as it is loaded with some of Iowa's best independent restaurants and unique shops. It has been named as one of the Top Ten Coolest Small Towns in America by travel journalists.      History   A visit must include spending some time admiring the Merchants' National Bank building, one of the eight Midwestern "jewel box" banks designed by Louis Sullivan, an architecture legend and mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright.      The jewel box banks are made of brick. For the Grinnell bank, Sullivan chose a variety of brick colors, giving the 1914 building a reddish-brown appearance. The building has a jewel box or strongbox look with an ornamental interior and cathedral-like exterior.      The building is open to the public. It is currently the Grinnell Area Chamber of Commerce and visitors center. It is open year-round Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call ahead for a weekend visit. Docents are often available to answer questions. For more information call 641-236-6555.      Art   Grinnell thrives in arts and culture. The Grinnell College Museum of Art, formerly known as the Faulconer Gallery, is in the Bucksbaum Center for the Arts and is worth a stop. The museum offers major exhibits from international and national artists. The museum encompasses a print and drawing study room that offers students and faculty a place to see original works on paper from the museum's collection, including some by Pablo Picasso and Rembrandt van Rijn. The museum has more than 6,000 items.      It is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday except for major holidays, but is currently closed due to the pandemic. Check the website for opening information or contact wrightl@grinnell.edu. The museum is also offering virtual tours and information from the artists at grinnell.edu/campus-life/arts-culture/museum.      Unique stay   There were probably times, as a student, you might have fallen asleep in class, but this unique, fun hotel offers visitors a chance to sleep in a classroom and not get in trouble.      Hotel Grinnell is a 1921 former junior high building with a variety of modern hotel rooms. Although the rooms are modern, they are also retro, and the design incorporates school items such as benches and the original hardwood floors. Rooms, in general, are half classroom and proved to be quiet and peaceful.      The hotel uses a bit of humor. An example is the necktie visitors hang on the door to not be disturbed. Rooms are not all the same as the former locker rooms are now bunk rooms. Each room also has a chalkboard. One of guests' favorite amenities are the complimentary bikes to get around town.      Different artwork is displayed in each room. The halls have been kept looking like a school, yet with a comfortable setting of a modern hotel.      The Periodic Table bar takes on a gymnasium look with an operating scoreboard on the wall. Owner-Operator Angela Harrington said the bar specializes in craft cocktails and mocktails. They have suspended food service at this time to encourage guests to dine around town.      The hotel is currently open with touchless check-in and has suspended daily cleaning services to minimize the exposure to others of each room. However, there are always housekeeping services available when needed. Visit hotelgrinnell.com for more information.      Pizza   There are a variety of great restaurants in Grinnell, and one that pizza seekers stand in line for is Pagliai's, known for their fresh made dough. They have been serving up pies since 1957. They also offer made from scratch dishes passed down from generation to generation. It won't disappoint and is within walking distance of Hotel Grinnell. Visit pagliaisgrinnellia.com for hours and new on when dine-in reopens.      Grinnell is a gem of a town located between Des Moines and Iowa City. It is well worth the short venture off I-80 to enjoy a day, a weekend, or to kick back for a few days and enjoy a peaceful walkable community adventure.      If you travel soon, make sure to check online or with the places you plan to visit to see if they are open, or have new hours, etc.

Jeff Williams wrapped up his 15th football season as Southside's coach needing just one more win to achieve 100 at the school.
   
 That chance won't come, however, as Williams' next win will be his first as coach at a different program.
   
 Williams, who led Southside to 99 wins and one state title while playing for two more, officially resigned his post on Monday night when he accepted an offer to become the new coach at Pea Ridge.
   
 For Williams, it was a chance to get to return to his small-town roots, having grown up in a similar small town, Pocahontas, in northeast Arkansas.
   
 "Fort Smith has been good to me and it's just hard (to leave), but as a coach sometimes, you're looking for that next challenge," Williams said. "I grew up in a small town also and it just felt like the right thing to do, I prayed about it and this was the right thing to do at the time, this time."
   
 Also hired Monday by Pea Ridge was Tony Travis, who will be the school's new athletics director. A Booneville native, Travis formerly was the football coach at both Pea Ridge and Rogers Heritage.
   
 "It was just one of those deals that kind of fell into my lap," Williams said. "I've gotten a lot of phone calls from people throughout the state when jobs are open about different guys and things like that, and Tony Travis is someone I've known for a long time and he's a good friend.
   
 "He kind of talked to me about it, and I've kind of been watching that place for a while and watched it grow and the success they've had and how the community backed it. It's a one-school town obviously, and that's what I kind of grew up about."
   
 Williams, who went 99-76-1 at Southside and is 108-88-2 for his career, will replace Stephen Neal as the coach at Pea Ridge. Neal took a job as an assistant coach at Edmond (Okla.) Deer Creek.
   
 Pea Ridge will also be moving up a class this upcoming season, going from 4A to 5A.
   
 "You've just kind of got to look out there one more time and just accept that challenge and try to make a run and they're moving up from 4A to 5A; it's a town that's really growing, it's a town that I think has a big upside, and I just kind of wanted to try that experience," Williams said.
   
 Another thing which enticed Williams to make the move is that he will get to oversee the football players at Pea Ridge from the second grade on.
   
 "I've always been about developing players and that part of it, and I'm going to get to help develop young guys and just watch them grow," he said.
   
 Williams came to Southside in 2005 after a stint as El Dorado's coach. He replaced Barry Lunney Sr., who ironically also left Southside to go to Benton County when Lunney became coach at Bentonville.
   
 In Williams' second season, 2006, Southside - then known as the Rebels - made it all the way to the 7A championship game and was a decided underdog against Rogers. But the Rebels rallied late, getting a field goal in the closing seconds to pull off a 23-22 win and the 7A championship.
   
 That 2006 title remains the last state title at Southside, though the program made two more big runs in 2008 and 2009 to reach the 7A title game both seasons.
   
 Those 2008 and 2009 playoff runs were highlighted by incredible rallies for wins, notably the 2008 7A semifinal against Springdale Har-Ber on a late two- point conversion as well as a 2009 playoff win on the road against Lunney's Bentonville squad.
   
 Southside also reached the semifinals in 2012, 2014 and 2015.
   
 "It's bittersweet because, what can you say, for 15 years he's roamed the sidelines at Southside and has done pretty doggone good when you look at that resume," Fort Smith Public Schools athletics director Michael Beaumont said. "He's been to the show, he's won at the show, he's done everything, so it's going to be a huge loss and a huge gap to fill here at Southside.
   
 "I am very excited about the opportunity of Jeff getting a new chance somewhere else and I'm so happy for him. ... Even though we didn't get a chance to work but a year together, I knew a lot about Jeff and his character and his ability to turn things around and keep tradition and pride going, which is what he did at Southside."
   
 But over the past four seasons, Southside - which changed its nickname to the Mavericks in 2016 - combined to win a total of 13 ballgames. That included a 1-9 finish a season ago.
   
 Williams stressed the recent downturn in Southside's football fortunes didn't play a factor in his decision to go to Pea Ridge.
   
 "Obviously we've had a couple of tough years, but not really," he said. "That really didn't factor into that at all.
   
 "Last year was a really tough year on us, but I'll say this, our kids played extremely hard and they always gave us the best effort, but that really didn't have a factor in it. I think it was more just the fact that it was a new challenge for me."
   
 The new challenge now for Southside is to find another coach who can help get the team back to its glory days. This upcoming season, the Mavericks will also return to play in the 7A-West conference after spending the past four seasons in the 7A-Central.
   
 "I think there's many, many things that you look for in a great football coach and we don't want a good football coach, we want a great football coach," Beaumont said. "And for sure you want to find somebody that can connect and build relationships not just with the community and the school itself, but with our kids.
   
 "For sure, somebody that's got a great football mind and a background, but you also want somebody who can just become ingrained in what they do, and a work ethic and a passion that just lives and breathes what Southside is. ... That's what I'm going to be looking for, is somebody that's going to be excited about being here."
   
 Southside's new coach will also have an interesting season opener right out of the gate. The Mavericks will take on city rival Northside in a non-conference game on Aug. 27 after having spent decades as conference rivals.
   
 Northside coach Mike Falleur, who has gone up against Williams' Southside teams since taking over the Grizzlies in 2013, admitted the news of Williams' departure took Falleur by surprise.
   
 "It was a little bit of a shock, especially as late as it is in the year, but things happen funny in the coaching world," Falleur said. "Jobs open up at different times and stuff, but if that's what Jeff wanted to do, I'm happy for him; staying somewhere for 15 years is a long time, especially in today's world of coaching.
   
 "(Williams' Southside teams) were always very physical, offensively and defensively, especially in the line of scrimmage. ... Always very well- coached, played very hard and just good football teams. I know it's been a little tough the last couple of years (at Southside), but heck, we all go through that if you coach long enough."
   
 Williams remarked one drawback to taking the Pea Ridge job was not getting the chance to meet in person with the Southside players and tell them his decision, since the school has been closed and there is an Arkansas Activities Association-mandated dead period due to the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 "Probably the hardest thing (Monday) was not being able to look my players in the eyes and tell them and that was really, really hard for me, but at this time with the way everything is, it's just really, really difficult," Williams said. "And it's tough, too, going up to Pea Ridge and not seeing those guys. ... I had a lot of (former Southside players) reach out to me (Monday) and FaceTimed a few guys."
   
 Williams added the biggest thing he will miss about Southside is the people, in particular the administration.
   
 "It's the people; it's the people at Southside High School," Williams said. "(Former principal) Wayne Haver was a great leader for us, Dr. (Lisa) Miller (the current principal) has come in and been a great leader for our school and faculty.
   
 "Then the teachers; at Southside, it's kind of more of a family and the thing about it is the other coaches in other sports and it's just the bond that we've had over the years. That's what makes Southside special, and it's tough, and the players we've got now coming back. ... They're going to get a good coach and they're going to have a good team, but I just felt like at this point in time it was best for me and my family to make a move."

Peaceful Nelson, Nevada, offers visitors a step back in time to the vibrant mining days of Nevada, the Silver State, an escape from daily life.   This ghost town is off the beaten path, and while standing among its historic buildings one would not think they were just a 45-minute drive from the bright lights of Las Vegas. Those traveling from Vegas on Route 95 will also pass Eldorado Canyon and "the monument," Nevada Historical Marker 9.      After an enjoyable ride through the valley travelers will come upon several original buildings from the 1700s. Originally, Nelson was called Eldorado, named by the Spaniards. They were the first to find gold in the mountains. About 100 years later the miners and prospectors developed the Techatticup Mine, which stands today in Nelson. The mine has a clouded reputation of killings that resulted from labor and management disputes. However, in 1861 the mine was considered to be the most important in the canyon as it produced millions of dollars of gold ore. The mine, a short distance from the Colorado River, was served by steamboats. The name Techatticup came from two Paiute words meaning "hungry" and "bread."      This now ghost of a town produced millions of dollars of copper, silver and gold until the mine closed in 1945.      Today mine tours are offered by stopping at the General Store in Nelson to sign up for the Eldorado Canyon Mine Tours. The buildings offer a historic tour of collectables from the area. Canoe and kayak rentals are available for those wanting to take an adventure on the beautiful Colorado River.      Inside the General Store is a small museum with pictures and information on the filming that takes place at Nelson, along with memorabilia and historic information. All ages will enjoy exploring the museum and walking around outside finding old cars, trucks and airplanes. The planes were used as props for the movie "3,000 Miles to Graceland." This ghost town is a popular area for use in movie backdrops, photo shoots and music videos. The National Geographic Channel's "Brain Games" was filmed in Nelson, as were the movies "Eye of the Beholder" and "Breakdown."      Do not get your hopes up when you travel downhill and see the Texaco sign standing tall among the historic buildings of Nelson. It is also historic. There is not a gas station or place to eat here. However, the General Store offers snacks and drinks. Fill your tank before setting out to visit Nelson.      Once you have completed the exploration of Nelson, continue to the end of the road where a spectacular view of the Colorado River awaits. Pack a picnic and find a rock, bring chairs, or sit in the car and enjoy what nature has to offer. Visitors can walk down to the river from this area.      Coming back uphill from the river, continue past the general store and on the left will be a few houses and a dirt road, Main Street. Turn left and follow it for a desert drive. If it is raining or has recently rained, better go back the way you came. If you are short on gas or time, do not do it! However, if you do continue, it is a climb to the top where big eared jackrabbits might be seen. Keep your camera ready as road runners are fast but you might get a picture, and the burros are much slower -- they will pose longer.      The road will take desert adventurers back down to Highway 95. A left turn goes into Searchlight, another mining town which, in its heyday around 1902 was more populated than Las Vegas. Today about 500 residents call this town home.      A few buildings are left from the mining days. Searchlight has modern structures, too -- gas stations, places to get a drink and some food, including McDonalds. Las Vegas is one hour from Searchlight and 30 minutes from Laughlin.

La norma, però, ha subito una pesante rivisitazione per opera delle riforme del 2012 e del 2015. Nel 2012 la riforma del lavoro Fornero ha previsto, al posto della sola reintegra, quattro differenti regimi di tutela che si applicano gradatamente a seconda della gravità dei vizi che inficiano il licenziamento. In seguito, poi, alla promulgazione e attuazione del Jobs Act da parte del governo Renzi, attraverso l'emanazione di diversi provvedimenti legislativi varati tra il 2014 e il 2015, l'art. 18 è rimasto in vigore per i soli rapporti instaurati prima del 7 marzo 2015 (data di entrata in vigore del decreto legislativo numero 23/2015) e già destinatari della tutela prevista dalla norma. Da tale data, infatti, per i contratti a tempo indeterminato si applica la disciplina del cosiddetto contratto a tutele crescenti, introdotta sempre dal dlgs 23/2015 (decreto attuativo del Jobs Act). Per tutti i lavoratori assunti con contratto di lavoro subordinato a tempo indeterminato e licenziati ingiustamente, la norma prevede come sanzione principale un pagamento di un'indennità risarcitoria, limitando ulteriormente le ipotesi di reintegrazione nel posto di lavoro.

The proposal of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to construct a sub-station on the premises of Anna University, Coimbatore, has run into rough weather because of the plot allocated for the project.
 According to a Tangedco official, one acre was identified initially for the project on the University premises and an alternative land was later provided as the area first identified was said to be on the proposed Western Bypass alignment. The Tangedco paid for the land three years ago and the contract was awarded one-and-a-half years ago. However, the official claims, for some reason, saplings were planted in the same area where the sub-station is to come up.
 Not all the saplings have grown into trees and these have to be removed to go forward with the construction work. “We will not be able to change to another area now as it will take longer time and lead to escalation of project cost,” the official says.
 On Thursday, about 150 trees were cut to commence the construction work. Sources in the voluntary organisation that has taken up sapling planting on the premises, says nearly 80,000 saplings were planted on Anna University premises to develop ‘Kalam Vanam’ and the first set was planted nearly five years ago. On the plot where the sub-station is proposed, the saplings have grown into trees. The entire project has changed the environment in and around the university. The work should be taken up without bringing down the trees.
 The Tangedco official said revenue officials visited the site on Friday morning and asked if the Corporation will be able to remove the saplings from the land where the sub-station is proposed and replant them on another site. “We have said we will be able to do so,” the official said.
 A district administration official said the issue is expected to be resolved in a couple of days.

In some ways, Naumann compared the economic disruption of COVID-19 to Bozeman's gas explosion. But this time it's happening "on every street, in every town, across the entire country" -- and "most of the world," he said.
 I grew up in Bozeman, an outdoorsy university town of about 50,000 people. It sits in a panoramic valley set against the Bridger Mountains and the Gallatin Range, more than an hour north of Yellowstone National Park. Snowfall continues into late spring, often turning the winters into a test of endurance. The brief summers feel perfect, perhaps because of what came before.
 Last fall, I returned to Bozeman to report on the impact of all the growth. By the time I finished the story, most states, including Montana, had issued stay-at-home orders. By mid-May, the state had reported more than 450 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with by far the highest number in Gallatin County, where Bozeman is. While the number of cases in Montana appears to have declined recently and the state is taking steps to reopen, even "The Last Best Place" has not been able to hide from the virus.
 Before COVID-19 spread, scores of millennials like me were leaving large US cities for affordable housing and opportunities elsewhere, particularly in the South and the West, according to William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. This marked a shift from the periods during and after the Great Recession, when cities grew faster than suburbs, Frey said. He attributed some of this to millennials, who may have been unable to afford homes or make big life changes and so moved to cities and stayed put. But in recent years, millennials had reverted to what Frey called more "normal" suburbanization patterns, moving not only to suburbs of the cities they're in, but elsewhere, he told me before the pandemic. "Of course, the economic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis may change all of this," he wrote in April.

It didn't take Van Buren very long to fill its head girls basketball coaching position.
   
 Michael Kinney, a Van Buren native who had been an assistant with the Lady Pointers, was officially named to take over the program Thursday afternoon.
   
 "You just don't understand how excited I am about the challenge," Kinney ― a 1990 Van Buren graduate and a former Pointer basketball player ― said. "I'm looking forward to the challenge."
   
 Kinney replaces Chris Bryant, who earlier in the week transitioned into the administration ranks as he accepted an offer to become assistant principal at Van Buren High School.
   
 Bryant had been the Lady Pointers' coach for the past six seasons and took the team to the state tournament in all six of those seasons. He won a total of 103 games with the Lady Pointers.
   
 Kinney had been Bryant's assistant each of those past six seasons.
   
 "Coach Bryant is just a top-notch guy," Kinney said. "I learned a tremendous amount of basketball from him, and not just basketball, but just the way he handles kids, the way he talks with them, the way he interacts with them, so it's just given me an opportunity to just go out and see what I can do with them.
   
 "Once Coach Bryant talked about going into administration, he asked if I would be interested in being the girls coach, and that's when the fire really started burning in me."
   
 Kinney has also spent 23 years in the Van Buren school system, which also included spending 15 years coaching at Butterfield Junior High as well as coaching at Van Buren's Freshman Academy. He has coached girls and boys basketball along with football.
   
 In Bryant's first four seasons at Van Buren, the team made it to at least the quarterfinal round at state. That included the 2016-17 team, which went 22-6 and defeated Northside in the quarterfinals of the 7A tournament, which was held at Van Buren's Clair Bates Arena.
   
 Van Buren was eventually defeated by North Little Rock in the 7A semifinals.
   
 This past season, Van Buren finished 10-18 but still qualified for the 6A state tournament as the No. 6 seed from the 6A-West. The Lady Pointers hung tough with Cabot in their opening-round game before Cabot pulled away for the win.
   
 "He has done a tremendous job," Kinney said of Bryant. "When he took over and I came up with him, he took a program that was struggling at the time and just watching what he does, the amount of time that he put into it, the work he put into it.
   
 "You really think that you're working until you start working with him, and then you look back and you think, 'Man, I didn't work like that prior to this.' ... And I'll still lean on him; there's going to be times I'll go up to his office and ask him questions."
   
 Kinney, who originally attended college at the University of Arkansas before transferring to Arkansas Tech and graduating from there, had his first job in Alma teaching physical education to elementary school students. He spent one year there before going back to Van Buren to begin his coaching career.
   
 Both he and his wife Shelly's two children played basketball for Van Buren, son Dylan and daughter Jamilyn, who just finished her sophomore season as a guard at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn.
   
 "I'm picking her brain right now as we speak and talking to her about sets that they run at Belmont," Michael Kinney said.
   
 Kinney's promotion continues a recent series of changes in Van Buren's athletic department.
   
 Earlier this year, longtime Pointer baseball coach David Loyd announced his retirement. Assistant coach Luke Weatherford was recently promoted to take over as head coach.
   
 Then last week, longtime athletics director Randy Loyd announced his retirement, effective at the end of the school year.
   
 Kinney confirmed that Loyd continued to play a part in the hiring process for the Lady Pointer basketball program following Bryant's move into administration.
   
 "I called and talked to (Loyd) once Chris got his job, and I told him I was interested in the girls job," Kinney said. "And he had already known it; him and Chris had talked about it.
   
 "So once I talked to Randy, he said, 'If you want it, you're the one I want getting it.' Ultimately the decision came down to our superintendent, Dr. (Harold) Jeffcoat, but Coach Loyd told me he was on board with me and thought that it was time for me."

But decisions have been made regarding the immediate future, including summer school.
 LISD’s secondary summer school will be held virtually in June. Registration will take place at the respective high school cafeteria so that social distancing can be followed. But Rogers said preregistration will be offered virtually to help reduce the number of in-person registrations.
 Rogers said the district is considering limited face-to-face summer sessions with students based on their needs, and those would take place in Lewisville High School gymnasiums so students can be spread out.
 Rogers said LISD has also worked on plans for its early childhood bilingual summer school.
 “We will have a backup virtual plan, but we’re still waiting on future guidance from TEA,” Rogers said.
 LISD is ordering learning backpacks for home use, and a drive-thru distribution plan is in the works. Rogers said LISD is recommending a modified virtual experience, and that because of the students’ age it may necessitate small group, in-person classes two to three times a week.
 Extended school for special education students will begin this summer virtually.
 “Multiple special education teachers have commented that one positive that has come from this is increased communication with parents, better relationships with students and improved technology skills that will carry them over to the traditional classroom,” Rogers said.
 Rogers said the ACE summer program will still be held at DeLay Middle School and Central, Lakeland and Lewisville elementary schools, but a virtual program developed by Communities in Schools of North Texas to focus on the social and emotional needs of those students.

"When I got sick, I didn't even know what COVID-19 was," said Jean, a resident of rural Snohomish County who asked only to be identified by her middle name.
 But after Jean received word from her doctor earlier this month that a highly touted serology test found a sample of her blood positive for antibodies to COVID-19, she's now convinced the official timeline is wrong -- and public health officials say she may be right.
 Jean is among two Snohomish County residents who have positive serology tests potentially linked to COVID-like illnesses dating back to December, throwing into question whether the coronavirus arrived in Washington, and the United States, earlier than previously known.
 Although neither case offers ironclad proof of that -- an antibody test can't pinpoint exactly when someone was exposed to the virus -- each patient's test results, combined with the clinical symptoms in December, appear to meet the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) case definitions for COVID-19.
 "They are being considered 'probable,'" Heather Thomas, a Snohomish Health District spokeswoman, said in an email Thursday. "However, they are not captured in our case counts from Jan. 20 forward."
 After The Seattle Times asked about Jean's case this week, the local health district said it had a second positive antibody case involving a person who showed symptoms in December, but provided no further details. Thomas said the district's health officer, Dr. Chris Spitters, is planning to talk about the cases during a Friday news briefing. A brief report accounting for all of the district's known reports of positive antibody tests, about 30, would be issued, Thomas said.
 The two cases provide more circumstantial fodder to mounting doubt among medical doctors, research scientists and others that the Snohomish County man who tested positive on Jan. 20 is the purported Patient Zero who introduced the coronavirus to the U.S. The man had been traveling solo since November in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak appears to have originated. He returned to the Seattle area on Jan. 15 and days later began showing symptoms.
 "My own guess is that there wasn't one introduction or Patient Zero who brought the virus to the United States," said Dr. Art Reingold, a public health epidemiologist at the University of California at Berkeley. "There were likely earlier and multiple introductions of the virus."
 Timeline uncertain
 Because the virus's undetected spread in Washington and elsewhere predated broad testing in the United States, a definitive timeline for COVID-19-related cases and deaths remains in question, scientists say.
 Already, studies in other nations have poked holes in what previously were thought to be starting points for the virus. Researchers in France recently found a COVID-19 case dating to Dec. 27 -- nearly a month before that nation's first previously confirmed case on Jan. 24. A genetic study published by researchers in Britain this month also found evidence to support "extensive worldwide transmission of COVID-19" likely infecting people in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere weeks or possibly months before some of the first reported cases in January and February.
 "The amount of air travel into and out of Wuhan was enormous, probably thousands and thousands of people," Reingold said. "It follows that there was likely multiple introductions around the world, quite possibly in December."
 Likewise, a timeline for COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S. has been pushed backward. A resident of the LifeCare Center of Kirkland who died Feb. 26 initially was believed to be the first death, but retrospective autopsies of two people in Santa Clara County, California, in April revealed each had died from the illness earlier, with the first death occurring on Feb. 6. That discovery prompted California Gov. Gavin Newsom to direct local medical examiners and coroners to investigate whether COVID may have claimed anyone in the state even earlier -- as far back as December.
 Washington state also has reviewed some cases of those who died from pneumonia or respiratory illnesses, but so far hasn't found any that predate the first confirmed COVID-19 case in January, State Health Officer Dr. Kathy Lofy said. The King County Medical Examiner's Office retrospectively tested 20 bodies in its morgue, but none were confirmed positive. Public Health -- Seattle & King County said it is reviewing medical records for some individuals who may have contracted the disease early this year. Medical examiners and coroners elsewhere in the state are considering retrospective testing of tissue and blood samples from earlier cases, but the state so far hasn't directed such reviews.
 Local and state public health officials also say they don't have much capacity to investigate whether individuals like Jean, who receive positive antibody test results, may have had COVID-19 earlier than the first known case.
 "It's always interesting to go back and find out how things have started, but it's hard to put those pieces together," Lofy said. "I think a lot of our focus now is on the current spread of the virus and stopping new transmissions."
 As far as including positive antibody tests in daily case counts, public health agencies in Washington don't yet appear to be on the same page. The CDC's case definitions note "serologic methods for diagnosis are currently being defined," but also list someone with a positive serology test as a "presumptive" case. That means to be formally counted, the person must also have had certain clinical symptoms at some point, or close contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 -- details that require additional investigation to find out.
 "Local health jurisdictions are encouraged to investigate patients with positive antibody results if they have the resources, but these investigations are not required," state Department of Health (DOH) spokeswoman Lisa Stromme Warren said.
 Still, DOH said it now counts antibody tests as "probable cases," but the dates reported for them may vary based on when test results came back or on when symptoms or ties to other cases occurred.
 The Snohomish Health District has received other reports of positive antibody tests, "but case investigations on those are a lower priority in follow-up, as our focus is on current cases," Thomas said.
 A Public Health -- Seattle & King County spokesman said that agency isn't now counting positive antibody tests in its daily counts, noting CDC guidance remains pending and there is "high potential for false negatives and positives" in serology tests.

While a sensible diet and a varied exercise routine is always going to be beneficial, I’ve found the slightest changes to my daily routine also help.

“We unveiled a color coded system prepared by medical experts at area hospitals to help residents make choices about engaging in activities,” Jenkins said in a press release. “The document is called Dallas County COVID-19 Health Guidance for the Public. Our current status is red, which means residents should avoid crowds, maintain 6 feet of distance, wear a cloth covering at businesses or on public transportation as well as practice good hygiene. #StayHomeSaveLives is the best way to #FlattenTheCurve.”
 The red is defined as “stay home, stay safe.” From there the system goes to orange – extreme caution; yellow – proceed carefully; and green – the new normal until there’s a vaccine.
 The Dallas County COVID-19 Health Guidance for the Public color coded system helps people decide what activities they should do by categorizing businesses/activities base on risk of community transmission. Since Dallas County is currently in the red, this means there’s a high risk of community transmission, and it’s advised that people limit their trips to the grocery stores and avoid crowds.
 With a 14-day decline, the county could move into the orange/moderate community risk for transmission and this opens up other activities with precautions. From there, yellow is low community risk for transmission and green is the new normal risk for transmission.

However, the problems with unemployment assistance continue to plague many Vermonters who are having trouble obtaining the benefits they are owed and are running out of money. There are several reasons for this situation that amounted to a perfect storm for the Vermont Department of Labor. It should be noted that most other states are having similar issues.
 Take the age of the computer system that handles unemployment claims. It is running on a mainframe computer that was state of the art in the 1970s but is woefully outdated now. It is programmed in a language called COBOL. Programmers familiar with COBOL are long-retired or about to retire. Large scale updates to the software are not feasible or practical.
 Two attempts over the last decade to replace the system, both of which were part of a consortium of several states to share the cost of development, have not been successful.
 So, now we’re stuck with an inadequate system that was working fine when there were 200-400 applications per week but can’t handle the 87,000 that were generated en masse since mid-March.

Britain’s Silverstone racetrack will stage two grands prix during the Formula One season, subject to UK government approval, circuit chiefs said on Friday.
 The coronavirus outbreak has caused huge disruption to the F1 calendar, with 10 races either cancelled or postponed.
 Silverstone managing director Stuart Pringle told the BBC that an agreement in principle had been reached with Formula One to hold the races at the central England circuit, immediately after the season begins in Austria.
 “I am delighted to confirm that Silverstone and Formula One have reached an agreement in principle to host two races behind closed doors this summer,” he said.
 “However these races will be subject to government approval, as our priority is the safety of all involved and strict compliance with Covid-19 regulations.
 “I would like to thank all our fans who have been so supportive throughout this and to assure them we are determined to do all we can to help Formula One put on a show this summer.”
 The BBC reported that the agreement would hinge on the government giving dispensation over quarantine restrictions.
 The government’s coronavirus recovery strategy document sets out an intention to introduce a 14-day quarantine rule for international arrivals, except those from Ireland and France.
 Organisers are hoping to start the season with the Austrian Grand Prix on July 5 behind closed doors, followed by a second race at the Red Bull Ring a week later.
