Palace dominated for large spells of the first half at White Hart Lane and held firm in the second to secure an impressive away Premier League point.


  Jason Puncheon almost netted a late winner, but Warnock reserved special praise for the attacking trio of Chamakh, Bolasie and Zaha.


  While Chamakh operated well as the lone striker, the trickery of Bolasie and Zaha posed a constant danger for Spurs' full-backs.


  "Man-of-the-match for me was Chamakh. I thought he covered every blade of grass," Warnock explained.


  "As a journalist you'd have given it Bolasie, wouldn't you? But I see what Chamakh does for the whole team and I thought he was outstanding.


  "It's a manager's man-of-the-match but Bolasie, what can you say about Bolasie? Wilfried's never worked as hard either so I was pleased with both them lads.


  "There were two or three bits of skill that you'd never see at Barcelona or Real Madrid would you?


  "I mean Yannick's first and Wilfried's step-in - both from a similar position - I couldn't see how they did it even looking back."


  With West Brom and Sunderland both drawing, Palace remain 15th and Warnock felt his team showed enough endeavour to clinch all three points.


  However, he also expressed pleasure as Palace continued a theme of picking up points against those teams in the upper reaches of the Premier League.


  Asked if he was disappointed with the draw, he added: "Oh God, I am. The opportunity was to come to White Hart Lane and get three points.


  "But when the chips are down, we're that kind of club, we love to prove people wrong.


  "When we play teams that are supposed to beat us we probably enjoy those games more. We've had some great chances, if one of the top teams had our chances they would have won three or four nil."

The Swiss government has thrown a lifeline to businesses that are threatened with bankruptcy during the pandemic lockdown. Firms can delay declaring their financial difficulties to the courts, with smaller companies being given at least three months’ grace to pay off their debts.
 The measures have been announced to save firms going under with a resultant loss of jobs. Non-essential businesses have been forced to close their doors for several weeks as part of a government plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
 The Swiss state has provided more than CHF60 billion in the form of bridging loans, paying the wages of workers on shortened hours and cash injections into specific industries.
 But many companies are still struggling to make ends meet with their business effectively shut down. For this reason, the government introduced on Thursday further measures to ease bankruptcy proceedings.
 Companies must show they were in good health at the end of 2019, that their financial difficulties were caused by the pandemic, and that there is a reasonable chance business can be resumed when the restrictions are lifted.
 If these criteria can be met, then the normal obligation to file for insolvency can be temporarily lifted. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will also be given an extra three months to pay off their debts – a period that could be extended to six months on application.
 However, this does not excuse companies from paying the wages of employees. The government had previously decided not to extend a general debt payment amnesty beyond April 20, fearing this would encourage firms to default on debts.

Under the FEED study, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. will develop, design and deliver a two-train (each train producing 4.8 million metric tons per annum of LNG) facility. It is expected to take 56 months to build a two-train project. Much of the construction should involve assembling modules built in offshore yards while employing approximately 4,500 local workers during peak construction. These employees will be housed at a temporary camp, which will be built on or nearby the existing decommissioned Sable Island sour gas plant site. Site preparation, site drainage, highway reconstruction and marine facilities are some of the major projects that must be assembled in tandem with, or prior to, the LNG liquefaction facility construction.

According to our analysis, early implementation would reduce carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) emissions in Guangdong by 40%, 84%, 65%, and 59%, respectively, in 2035. There is a larger impact on CO and HC emission reduction from the China 6 standard and the China VI standard will bring about more NOx and PM emission reduction. The cumulative emission reduction of CO, HC, NOx, and PM in Guandong from early implementation of both standards would be 4,670 metric tons, 3,980 metric tons, 4,160 metric tons, and 120,000 metric tons, respectively, through 2035. These huge emission reduction benefits will effectively contribute to the achievement of Guangdong’s near-to-long term air quality goals. However, implementing the China 6 and China VI standards is not the ultimate solution. Guangdong also needs to continue accelerating the deployment of zero-emission vehicles to ensure a sustained reduction of vehicle emissions in the long term.

PARMA, Italy (AP) — It was March 7, in the afternoon. Dr. Giovanni Passeri had just returned home from Maggiore Hospital, where he is an internist, when he was urgently called back to work. His ward at the hospital was about to admit its first COVID-19 case.
 Driving back to the hospital, down the tree-lined streets of Parma, Passeri, 56, recalled thinking: “Am I going now to my execution?”
 Italy’s more than 21,000 coronavirus dead have included scores of doctors, including a colleague of Passeri's at Maggiore, a hospital in one of Italy’s hardest-hit northern provinces.
 Since that afternoon more than a month ago, Passeri has worked every day. From the evening of April 7 until the morning of April 9, Associated Press photographer Domenico Stinellis documented his night and day, from a tense, 12-hour overnight shift to his drastically altered routine at home with his wife and 10-year-old son.
 In his apartment, he sleeps alone in a garret room hastily converted into a bedroom to prevent any chance of transmitting the virus to his wife. The first time his son, Francesco, leaped up to hug him when Passeri came home after tending to coronavirus patients, the physician stiffened. That's no longer safe, the physician had to say.
 Now, when Passeri senses that the emotional pressure on Francesco is building too much, they play cards together. Each wears a mask.

CHICAGO (AP) — California Sen. Kamala Harris is raising money for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden while speaking out about the disproportionate number of African Americans with COVID-19.
 Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has been praising the former vice president on television and Twitter as she unveils a plan to fight the coronavirus in rural America.
 Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer went on “The Daily Show” to plead for help addressing the pandemic while wearing a T-shirt with a jab at President Donald Trump.
 As Biden begins the process of choosing a running mate, responding to the COVID-19 pandemic has become an unexpected part of the audition. The women believed to be top candidates are competing for the job by trying to show off their leadership on issues thrust into the spotlight by the virus.
 That’s easier for some than for others. The coronavirus has put politics on the back burner for many. Rallies and fundraisers — where potential vice presidential candidates might essentially audition for the position — are barely happening. Meanwhile, governors in the running might seem to have an advantage as their official day job becomes a public test of their ability to handle a crisis in the spotlight.
 “Everything has changed, and this time calls for a No. 2 who can project confidence to voters that they can manage a pandemic,” said Adrienne Elrod, a Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. “If you can show that you’re doing that effectively, that makes you a more attractive choice, obviously.”

“It’s not about food. It’s about food culture,” he says. “It’s a culinary umbilical cord that connects them to their fathers’, their mothers’, their grandparents’ food, which relates back to the story of Singapore. Migrants came to Singapore, no hope, no job, no tomorrow, no money. And they said, ‘I gotta sell food to my people.’”      I realize quickly that I’m standing inside a modern-day museum. Every vendor and their delicacies are a direct living connection to the stories of the families who own the stalls and to the larger story of Singapore. How could this incredible piece of living history be at risk of dying out?      Some efforts have been made, with mixed results, in a social enterprise model aimed at revitalizing hawker food stalls. It’s also common these days to see headlines about hip young Singaporeans ditching their corporate lives and opting to preserve their parents’ street food legacy instead. Seetoh told me of a banking analyst with Malay roots who now hawks _chee cheong fan_ noodles. But that’s more of an exception to the rule.      “For every two young hawkers who open, 10 are saying bye-bye,” says Seetoh. “Everybody has a degree, everybody is looking to be the next big dot com or app thing. Who’s going to stand and sweat in that little 10 by 10 kitchen jail and hawk food that people love but underappreciate, at $3 a plate?”      Seetoh was a vocal advocate and advisor when Singapore recently submitted its hawker culture nomination for induction into the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2020. And his World Street Food Congress, which he founded in in Singapore 2013 to preserve, protect, and record the world’s great street food cultures, was attended by heavy hitters, including Bourdain and Noma cofounder Claus Meyer.      He’s hopeful that the potential UNESCO designation will shed more light on the uniqueness of the world’s great street food traditions—and possibly even create more government support and much-needed entrepreneurial innovation around preserving and continuing their legacy. Currently hawker food falls under Singapore’s National Environment Agency, but Seetoh is advocating for a dedicated team that focuses on hawker food, which has become one of Singapore’s top attractions.      “The trick about enjoying Singapore food culture is don’t just come here and eat. Know the backstory,” he says. “You see this Silk Road of food and it makes dining here so much more interesting.”      Check out our Instagram highlights for a tour of some of Singapore’s best street food stalls with KF Seetoh. And if your travels take you to Singapore soon, read on for a list of the places we ate, or book a tour with Seetoh and his team at Makansutra.

The agency’s Fisheries Division manages the facility where between 3- and 4 million steelhead eggs were collected in 2019. Program officials expected to take a similar number this spring — until coronavirus social distancing constraints halted the operation.
 Spring walleye egg and milt collection on the Muskegon River and at Little Bay de Noc, and muskellunge takes on the Detroit River are also canceled.
 “It was a difficult decision to pull the plug on the egg-take for three species for the season. It’s a big part of our program,” said Ed Eisch, state fish production manager based in Traverse City. “It’s disheartening.”
 Eisch said the decision was based on the need to preserve staff health and safety. The labor-intensive process of moving and rearing fish at state hatcheries does not allow for social distancing.
 Little Manistee River flows through Lake and Manistee counties. It’s a natural spawning run for steelhead. Fertilized steelhead trout eggs collected from the river are typically sent for rearing to Oden State Fish Hatchery near Petoskey and Harrietta State Fish Hatchery west of Cadillac. The Platte River Hatchery near Honor and Thompson Hatchery near Manistique rear walleye. Wolf Lake Hatchery near Kalamazoo rears walleye and muskies.
 In 2019 in Grand Traverse County alone, 16,697 steelhead stocked the Boardman River and 2,200 stocked Sand Lake. Silver Lake received 41,678 walleyes. Both 2020 species classes will be missing from future stocking efforts.
 “Obviously, nobody likes it,” said Wes Newberry, spokesperson for Grand Traverse Area Sport Fishing Association. “I can understand where they’re coming from, but I’m disappointed. You’re going to lose a year class of fish. It’s not going to crash the fishery, but it’s something you don’t want to do.”

“It seems like there’s at least two subjects here,” said David Powell, the representative of Attorney General Phil Weiser. “One has to do with this board. The second subject has to do with you guys wanting local governments to do certain things. I’m seeing that as two separate subjects.”
 In order to set a ballot title that appears before voters, the Title Board's principal task is to find the existence of a single subject. Sarah Mercer, an attorney for the designated representatives, responded that these initiatives were patterned after other successful ballot measures that set up a congressional redistricting commission and the state’s Independent Ethics Commission. She also pointed to a 2019 law that altered the role and the makeup of the COGCC while establishing local control over oil and gas operations.
 “This [initiative] seeks to build off of what SB181 does,” Mercer said.
 “181 set the parameters of the board,” countered board Chair Theresa Conley, the representative of Secretary of State Jena Griswold. “This is a much bigger overhaul. It creates a new board.”
 Jason Gelender, representing the Office of Legislative Legal Services, said that he was inclined to see it Mercer’s way. “I think that while it is a close call, this measure fundamentally deals with one thing: oil and gas operations,” he explained.
 The Title Board ultimately agreed that the measures pertained to the single subject of oil and gas regulation. As is customary when proponents put forward several proposals with minor variations between them, the designated representatives agreed that they would seek to place only one on the ballot.
 Nevertheless, two initiatives, 312 and 313, might be offered separately, as they pertain solely to the prohibition on the COGCC weakening its own standards or those of the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission. That latter provision surprised Gelender, who observed that one regulatory body cannot alter the rules of another.
 “The problem is that by putting in the measure language that says the board cannot repeal these certain AQCC rules, it implies the board has power to do that,” he argued. “But the board doesn’t.” Mercer and her co-counsel, Gwen Benevento, agreed with the observation.
 The board also set titles for two initiatives from Greg Brophy and Sam Bradley, one of which would allow municipalities or counties to assume regulatory authority from the COGCC over oil and gas operations if they so choose. The initiative would not, however, give those jurisdictions the right to enact moratoriums on drilling.
 “We wanted to ensure that this new section of the constitution would not allow a local government to abridge the property rights of an oil and gas company who has the lease on mineral rights in their jurisdiction,” Brophy said, of the moratorium provision.

Many people run against an incumbent because they have “a bone to pick” with the elected official. That is never the right motive and rarely do those looking for revenge win an election.
 Second, voters should carefully scrutinize, analyze, examine, and inspect candidate’s campaign material. Incumbents provide voters the advantage of a track record and their voting record and decision making is fair game. Challengers have the advantage of telling you what they will do (or won’t do) without a track record. Recognize campaign material for what it is- propaganda for the candidate. In every campaign, candidates are trying to do two things – define themselves and define their opponent.
 Third, the best elected officials are those who have the following attributes. (1) They are capable and fit for office. They are not a novice. Just because someone wants a position doesn’t mean they are qualified for that position. (2) They possess the right temperament for office. They can take criticism and don’t avoid questions from constituents. (3) They are accessible. They don’t avoid their constituents. Sadly, many elected officials only come out when they are up for re-election. (4) They are faithful. They have a track record of being trustworthy.
 The primary election is just 2 ½ months away. Expect the campaign material to start hitting your mail box in the next couple of weeks. Make sure you connect with candidates by phone, email, or social media. Ask them hard questions and cast your ballot for someone who you can turn your back on.

Roberto Martinez's side - already confirmed to finish first in the pool - was significantly weakened and the visitors took full advantage at Goodison Park to record their only win of the group stage.
 Marat Izmailov pulled the strings in midfield and set up the game's only goal, cleverly scored by Ricardo Laborde in the 30th minute.
 Everton, who named a bench exclusively of teenagers, were at their best when Arouna Kone - leading the line in his first appearance since October last year after overcoming a knee problem - had the ball.
 The Ivorian was a regular threat but the hosts - who also gave starts to youngsters Luke Garbutt, Tyias Browning, Ryan Ledson and Conor McAleny - lacked cutting edge and rarely looked like scoring after the first 30 minutes.
 Krasnodar's win lifted them above Lille, who lost 3-0 to German side Wolfsburg, and into third in the group.
 Bryan Oviedo - still on the comeback trail from a broken leg - and goalkeeper Joel Robles made rare starts for Everton, while Gareth Barry, suspended for the club's next Premier League match, deputised at centre-back and Steven Pienaar added experience.
 Everton's start was far from ideal, though, as winger Christian Atsu - on loan from Chelsea - hobbled off in the eighth minute clutching his hamstring, with England Under-17 international Kieran Dowell on to replace him.
 Antolin Alcaraz almost gave the home side the lead in the 10th minute when he nodded Garbutt's corner just wide but the chance failed to awake the crowd from their near-permanent slumber during the match.
 Kone stung the palms of Krasnodar goalkeeper Andrey Sinitsyn from 25 yards in the 15th minute before Krasnodar created their first meaningful chance - a powerful Wanderson effort that was well kept out by Robles.
 The Russian Premier League outfit grew into the game from there and Izmailov begun to show his class.
 Garbutt was Everton's brightest spark down the left and stormed to the byline before his half-cleared delivery allowed Pienaar to try his luck from distance, but again Sinitsyn was equal to the task.
 And the visitors made Everton pay for their missed chances when Laborde gave them the lead.
 Izmailov played him in with an excellent ball over the top and the scorer got there ahead of the onrushing Robles before turning away from goal, then spinning sharply and catching the goalkeeper unaware at the near post.
 It was a smart finish but perhaps Robles should have done better, as Everton headed into the break behind.
 Kone seemed desperate for a goal on his return and after an excellent turn, fired straight at Sinitsyn in the 50th minute, while Ragnar Sigurdsson made a smart block to deny Dowell after good build-up work from Oviedo.
 Izmailov could have sealed Krasnodar's win in the 72nd minute, but shot inches wide to end an excellent move from the visitors, before Kone nodded a free- kick over.
 But Krasnodar's 14 travelling fans - housed in corporate hospitality by Everton - went home happy as the hosts ultimately ran out of answers.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said the company plans to regularly test its hundreds of thousands of employees for coronavirus, including those who aren't showing symptoms, he said in an annual letter to shareholders published Thursday.
 This year's shareholder letter focused mainly on Amazon's response to the coronavirus pandemic, including ways for the company to respond and protect its gargantuan workforce, most of whom work in essential roles at grocery stores or distribution centers.
 "A next step in protecting our employees might be regular testing of all Amazonians, including those showing no symptoms," Bezos said. "Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running."
 In addition to calling for widespread, regular testing for employees across industries, Bezos said that Amazon would be developing its own tests, and has already started on that process.
 It's a reiteration of recent statements Bezos has made regarding testing Amazon employees for the virus. The vast majority of employees work in Amazon's product distribution centers in roles considered essential and unable to work from home, and safety has become a major issue amid the coronavirus pandemic. Employees told Business Insider that they were afraid to go to work and called social distancing measures at warehouses "impossible." Workers at several Amazon distribution centers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and at least one has died.

The Spanish giants are already assured of top spot in Group B following five straight victories, marking an impressive start to their European title defence.
 Carlo Ancelotti's side are also flying high at the top of La Liga after Saturday's 3-0 defeat of Celta Vigo made it 18 wins on the bounce in all competitions.
 However, any thoughts of taking their foot off the gas against Ludogorets on Tuesday appear to have been banished.
 "The key is to keep up this consistency," Germany midfielder Toni Kroos told the club's official website. "We have to keep working like this and winning games.
 "What's most important isn't the record for wins, but keeping on winning every game."
 Defender Marcelo echoed that view as Madrid look to maintain the only 100 per cent record in Europe's elite club competition this term.
 "The record is very important but we want to carry on working, fighting hard and winning, and to do that we have to be focused and we can't afford to relax," said the Brazil star.
 "We can't take anything for granted. The secret is hard work, fighting spirit, togetherness and everyone showing desire."
 Of course, Real also have the prodigious talents of Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored a record 23rd La Liga hat-trick against Celta - taking his tally to 200 in the Spanish top flight.
 Ancelotti's men have scored 67 goals during their 18-game winning sequence, with the Portugal forward netting 27 of those.
 "It is a real advantage to have Cristiano playing for us," said the Italian coach. "He is playing really well and he is in peak physical condition; he is extraordinarily motivated at the moment."
 The only negative for Real from Saturday's win was a calf injury to James Rodriguez, while Luka Modric (thigh) was already sidelined, but Isco returns from suspension and Sami Khedira (concussion) is also available.
 Ludogorets had the audacity to take an early lead against Real in Bulgaria at the start of October, before Ronaldo and Karim Benzema replied to Marcelinho's strike.
 The visitors are out of contention to reach the knockout rounds, but will finish third if they can better Liverpool's result against Basel.

VINE GROVE, Ky. (AP) — Deputies in Kentucky said a 14-year-old teenage girl escaped after she was kidnapped by a woman who was not wearing any pants. The girl told deputies she was on her way to visit her friend’s house last week when a woman jumped out of the woods and grabbed her, news outlets reported Tuesday. Kimberly Phelps, 50, has since been charged with attempted kidnapping of a minor. According to the Meade County Sheriff’s Office, Phelps told the girl she had been watching her “for a while” when she kidnapped her. The teen told deputies Phelps tried to take her toward a driveway before she freed herself and fled. Deputies said Phelps gave the girl drinking glasses and other items that she had with her when they found her. She told deputies she only approached the girl to give her a hug and a book. Court records show Phelps was charged with disorderly conduct in March for pushing employees at a Walgreens while intoxicated. She has been booked into a county detention center.

The Euro 2016 Group I qualifier in Belgrade, which marked the first time the two sides had met in the Serbian capital since 1967, was brought to a halt shortly before half-time when a drone carrying a flag featuring Albanian national symbols hovered over the pitch.
 Serbia defender Stefan Mitrovic attempted to pull the flag down, sparking scuffles between the two sides and leading to supporters invading the field as the situation worsened.
 Referee Martin Atkinson subsequently abandoned the contest, with UEFA then opting to award Serbia 3-0 walkover win but also docking them three points.
 Both teams were handed €100,000 fines by European football's governing body, while Serbia were ordered to play their next two home qualifying games behind closed doors.
 The ruling was appealed by the Football Association of Serbia and the Football Association of Albania but, following a meeting of UEFA's appeals body, the sanctions against both member nations have were confirmed on Tuesday.
 A UEFA statement read: "The UEFA Appeals Body met today, following appeals lodged by the Football Association of Albania (FShF) and the Football Association of Serbia (FSS) against the decisions taken by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) on 23 October in relation to various incidents that occurred during the UEFA European Championship qualifying Group I match between Serbia and Albania, which was played in Belgrade on 14 October.
 "The appeal of the FShF has been rejected. The original decision of the CEDB is therefore upheld. The UEFA Appeals Body has decided to confirm the above- mentioned match as forfeited. As a consequence, the FShF is deemed to have lost the match 3-0. In addition, the FShF has been fined €100,000.
 "The appeal of the FSS has also been rejected. Consequently, the original decision of the CEDB is upheld. The UEFA Appeals Body has decided to confirm the deduction of three points from the FSS for the current UEFA European Championship qualifying competition.
 "In addition, the FSS has been ordered to play its next two UEFA competition matches as host team behind closed doors. Finally, the association has been fined €100,000."

Sevilla sit second in the group's table with eight points, which would be enough to send them into the Europa League knockout stages, but the La Liga outfit host third-placed Rijeka (seven points), who will leapfrog the holders with a win.
 In fact, Rijeka could finish top of the group's standings if they win in Spain and leaders Feyenoord lose at Standard Liege.
 Feyenoord are guaranteed to progress, however, as they can only be passed by one of Sevilla and Rijeka on the final matchday of the group stage.
 At the start of October, Sevilla needed an equaliser from Stephane M'Bia in the first minute of second-half stoppage time to secure a 2-2 draw at Rijeka's home ground, and the Spanish club's coach Unai Emery is under no illusions of the task facing his team.
 "[Rijeka is] a good team and will be a very important game for us," the 43-year-old said after Sevilla's 1-0 win over Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.
 Sevilla won last year's Europa League title with a penalty shoot-out triumph over Benfica, after the match finished scoreless through 120 minutes.
 For Rijeka to overhaul Emery's team, however, the Croatian club will have to end their winless streak away from home in the Europa League proper, which is at five matches.
 In Group A, any combination of the top three clubs could progress with leaders Borussia Monchengladbach still not safe ahead of their clash with Zurich.
 Gladbach (nine points) could be passed by both third-placed Zurich (seven) and Villarreal, who sit second on eight points ahead of their trip to Apollon (three).
 It is essentially the same situation in Group B with leaders Club Brugge hosting third-placed HJK, while second-placed Torino visit bottom club Copenhagen.
 Premier League club Tottenham can wrap up top spot in Group C with a win at second-placed Besiktas, while Partizan will host Asteras Tripolis with neither club in the running for the knockout stages.
 Salzburg and Celtic have first and second spot sorted in Group D ahead of Thursday's respective clashes against Astra and Dinamo Zagreb, while in Group E, Dinamo Moscow will look to maintain their perfect run when they visit PSV, who cannot lose second spot, with Estoril taking on Panathinaikos in the other fixture.
 Azerbaijan's Qarabag - in their first Europa League group stage - have a chance to advance from Group F.
 Qarabag (five points) sit ahead of third-placed Saint-Etienne due to a superior head-to-head record but will need to at least match the French club's result on Thursday to progress.

Trump has displayed an eagerness to reopen the country, despite warnings from public health officials that moving too quickly could lead to a resurgence in cases, initially saying he wanted the economy "raring to go" by Easter. This week, he suggested that some states might be ready to begin the return to normal before the end of the month, and he has promised to unveil plans for getting the country back on its feet.
 "We are having very productive calls with the leaders of every sector of the economy who are all-in on getting America back to work, and soon," the president tweeted Wednesday. "More to come!"
 One main obstacle to getting the United States back to work remains something that has plagued the nation's response all along: a lack of reliable testing.
 The United States increased testing in mid-March, but progress has slowed. The number of tests performed daily still falls far short of what experts suggest is needed to allow Americans to start resuming normal activities.
 Nearly every day for the past two weeks, 120,000 to 140,000 tests have been administered, according to a tracker assembled by volunteer journalists and scientists. Nearly 3 million Americans - less than 1 percent of the population - have been screened for the virus. That leaves the United States still behind South Korea, Germany, Canada and Italy on per capita testing.
 The United States must perform approximately 1 million tests per day to reach levels similar to South Korea, a country that has become a global example of how to contain the virus' spread, according to Matthew Harrison, a biotech analyst for Morgan Stanley.
 Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said the United States should be testing 750,000 to 1 million people a day.
 "We're not even close to that," Redlener said. "Without having a lot more capacity to do rapid testing, it's not easy to see how we're going to start going back to work."

The government said 5.2 million more people applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the running total to about 22 million out of a U.S. work force of roughly 159 million — easily the worst stretch of U.S. job losses on record.


  Some economists say the unemployment rate could reach 20% in April, the highest since the Great Depression of the 1930s.


  While some leaders and citizens around the U.S. have called on government to reopen stores, factories and schools, health authorities and many politicians warned that returning to normal is a distant goal and that lifting restrictions too soon could allow the virus to come storming back.


  The decision of when and how to ease up rests not with the White House but with state and local leaders, who imposed the mandatory lockdowns and other restrictions put in place over the past month.


  The outbreak has infected more than 2 million people worldwide and killed more than 137,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, though the true numbers are believed to be much higher. The death toll in the U.S. reached about 31,000, with over 600,000 confirmed infections.


  Fallout from the virus spread in ways both predictable and devastating, from police torching an illicit food market in Zimbabwe, to emergency flights carrying foreign farm workers to Britain and Germany, and protests at U.S. state capitols against job losses.


  In France, Amazon suspended operations after a court ruled it wasn’t doing enough to protect its workers in the country. The online retailer has six warehouses in France.

The PGA Tour laid out an ambitious plan to resume its season Thursday, with hopes of a restart at Colonial on June 11-14 and keeping fans away for at least the first month. If government and health authorities give golf the green light, the tour will have an official event every week through Dec. 6 except for the week of Thanksgiving. The Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas, was pushed back a month to June and would be followed by the RBC Heritage, which was postponed this week. Title sponsor RBC had another tournament — the Canadian Open, the fourth-oldest national open in the world — that normally would have been played that week. Golf Canada said Thursday its Open has been canceled. The PGA Tour season would conclude with the Tour Championship on Labor Day, and a new season would start the following week (Sept. 10-13) in Napa, California. That would mean only one major — the PGA Championship — is held in this 2019-20 season, and as many as seven majors would apply to the following season. PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said while the priority is health and safety for everyone involved, “our hope is to play a role — responsibly — in the world's return to enjoying the things we love.”

JANESVILLE, Wis. — Adam Riley decided he was going to run a marathon before he turned 40 years old.
 Nothing — not even the coronavirus pandemic — could stop him.
 Riley had signed up to run the Milwaukee Marathon on April 11. But like almost every other sporting event around the world, the races — a half-marathon and 5K were also on the docket — were canceled.
 Like many other big races, Milwaukee Marathon organizers announced runners could complete their race “virtually.” They sent participants their race numbers, shirts and medals and encouraged them to run their races any time they could near their homes or even on treadmills.
 Even before any of that was announced, Riley had already determined he was still going to run his 26.2 miles.
 “I was really trying to do it before I turn 40 in August,” he told The Janesville Gazette. “So I couldn’t wait until October or something for maybe a different race. I had to get it done.”
 Riley, who said he has run half-marathons and other shorter distances in the past, mapped out a course. From his house, he would run east on Ruger Avenue out to Wuthering Hills Drive — a stretch of about 2.6 miles — and back. Five trips back and forth would get him to 26.2 miles.
 He did not exactly make it easy on himself. The course featured a couple prominent hills that took their toll.
 Riley said he told a friend or two about his plan but mostly kept it quiet.
 “I was just going to do it on my own,” he said. “Because what if I didn’t finish?”

If a gobbler is in earshot, he will come to investigate eventually as long as I don't overdo it. Using different calls sounds like a lot of different hens, and I play them every 15-30 minutes. In this way I have killed four Grant County longbeards between 1-6 p.m. It took about an hour to finally coax the 6 p.m. bird into range, and it required calling him away from a live hen. I've only done that once. Some might say that I overcall, but I like the results. I've killed a gobbler in Arkansas seven of the last eight years, and eight Arkansas gobblers in that same span thanks to a tag-out in 2019.

With the Azerbaijani side on their way out, Richard Almeida thought he had sent Qarabag into the last 32 when his 93rd-minute strike was deflected in off Inter defender Isaac Donkor.
 However, the joyous scenes at the Tofiq Bahramov Stadium in Baku were cut short when Leroy George was adjudged offside - giving Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk a lifeline they duly held onto by beating Saint-Etienne in Group F's other game on Thursday.
 Inter already guaranteed their place in the knockout stage by winning the group and Qarabag initially looked to be joining them as they were on course to gain a point.
 However, Dnipro saw off Saint-Etienne 1-0 to turn up the heat on Qarabag - seeking to become the first Azerbaijani team to progress past the group stage of a UEFA competition.
 Instead, Gurban Gurbanov's men slipped to third and will likely look back on what could have been with George appearing to be onside in the midst of a dramatic finale.
 The hosts created the first opportunity with a clever double step-over corner routine, but Rashad Sadygov scuffed his shot before Inter's Rene Krhin fired wide at the other end.
 It was Qarabag who made much of the early running - Namiq Alaskarov the next to go close with the home side controlling possession in the opening stages.
 However, goalkeeper Ibrahim Sehic gave coach Gurbanov a scare when he sliced a clearance high into the air just after the 20-minute mark, although Pablo Daniel Osvaldo could not get the loose ball under control.
 M'Baye Niang looked likely to edge Inter in front when he was played clear on goal, but an offside flag thwarted his progress before Qarabag's Vuqar Nadirov was forced off injured.
 Juan Pablo Carrizo was required to keep out George's effort from a tight angle in the final throes of the half as Qarabag went in at the break perhaps bemoaning their lack of cutting edge.
 Inter began the second period the brighter, with Federico Bonazzoli taking down Osvaldo's cross before seeing his shot deflected wide.
 Alaskarov failed to get on the end of Muarem Muarem's teasing delivery from the left as a relatively dour game began to show signs of life.
 In a low-key affair, all the drama came at the end as Almeida wheeled away having initially appeared to have made himself the hero with his deflected strike.
 The officials were left to field angry complaints from the hosts, however, as Gurbanov's men failed to extend their European campaign into 2015.

This is a significant acknowledgement from the most powerful person in Brussels. A formal recognition that in the panic of the moment when Italy most needed help, the famed EU "spirit of solidarity" did not show itself.
 It was a difficult moment for Ursula von der Leyen to raise. She is a leader who has shown great care in past weeks to avoid internal conflict and who has championed pragmatism and hope. But it seems an underlying rancour is still felt by Italians and others who feel there were too few good Samaritans when it counted - and it counted in early March, when Italy was the only country that had enforced a lockdown.
 Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte urgently requested medical equipment for hospital staff such as gloves and clothing as well as ventilators and testing kits, but it took several days before there was a response from any European government.
 The actions of Germany, France and the Czech Republic in particular caused unease, when they decided to block exports of emergency equipment to neighbours in need, until they had finished counting up what stocks they had. Even the usually conciliatory Belgian Health Minister Maggie De Block stated that it seemed "deeply against the the idea of a united Europe and fundamentally against the spirit of solidarity".

People see the carnage. The citizens of Wisconsin risked their lives to vote because they see the big picture. They realize that Trump is trying to kill them. You got jokes. They have courage. Some probably had their car dug out of the snow by a Republican and still came out to vote for the Democratic Party. DeWine and Hogan may be rational. Other Republicans in South Dakota, Florida, Georgia, Alabama are not rational. The national GOP wants grandma dead. Jerome rants about ills in the black community, but he did not address the reason that blacks have higher death rates from coronavirus. He did not address hypertension, heart disease, systemic lupus erythematosus in black women, that are the known risk factor. If Jerome cared about Big Mama, he would have told her to avoid crowds. Jerome would have said to Big Mama's offspring and grand children to bring her needed groceries, etc. to keep her safe while practicing safe distancing. Jerome did not do that.. Jerome failed at his job.

The left-back sustained the problem during the second half of Burnley's 1-1 Premier League draw with Newcastle United on Tuesday, and was carried from the field on a stretcher.
 Dyche was unable to give a definitive update in the immediate aftermath of the game, but revealed in a press conference on Thursday that the news was possibly worse than first feared.
 "Stephen Ward is not as good as we'd hope," he said. "We thought it might just be soft tissue, but it's a bit more than that.
 "We think it's a bone injury and we'll know more when we investigate it further.
 "He will see a specialist tomorrow and we'll then have more clarity to the news."
 Ward will certainly miss Saturday's trip to QPR, as will Michael Duff, who continues to struggle with a calf problem picked up in last month's 2-1 win at Stoke City.
 There was better news on striker Sam Vokes, though, who ruptured his anterior cruciate knee ligament in March and has been in rehabilitation ever since.
 The Wales international has scored three goals in two appearances for the development squad over the past two weeks, and Dyche is pleased with the way the 25-year-old is progressing.
 "I've said all along that Sam needs to get fit and well both physically and mentally," he added. "He's certainly looking that at the moment and there's more to come.
 "He's enjoying his journey back to full fitness and he's on the right pathway, that's for sure.
 "He's getting sharper and fitter and he's been training with us all the time for a number of weeks now.
 "To be honest, his recovery has been aligned with the specialist, physios, sports scientists and himself as well.
 "He's feeling he's in a good place at the minute and where he is beginning to get closer."
