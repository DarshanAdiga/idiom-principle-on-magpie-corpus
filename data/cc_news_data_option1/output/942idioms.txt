Third, and critically important to understand, the benefit to Musicians is not “just the money.” After all, many Musicians do not “need” the money (although top dollar is always nice). Rather, “active” buyers devote substantial marketing, branding, social media and other resources to seek out and drive new opportunities that would otherwise not exist. Those active efforts increase the value of the IP retained by Musicians, expand the audience for their songs, and drive their legacies into new generations.

While some of the charges pertain to putting personal car repair and warranty expenses on an airport credit card, most relate to his actions surround a 2014 loan guarantee to People Express Airlines.
 Under the agreement, TowneBank issued the $5 million line of credit to People Express, but the airport was on the hook to cover the debt if the airline defaulted.
 People Express collapsed in September 2014 — less than three months after beginning service. A few months after that, the airport paid off the loan’s outstanding debt with $4.5 million in taxpayer money.
 The Daily Press learned about the debt payment in early 2017, with the ensuing coverage leading to a state audit, a management shakeup — both Spirito and former City Manager Jim Bourey lost their jobs — and a criminal investigation.
 Waskey testified last week that the three special agents didn’t know about the lawsuit deposition until Spirito shared it with them.
 In the videotaped statement from March 2019, Spirito was being questioned by Conrad Shumadine, an attorney hired by the airport’s insurance company. (The Norfolk lawyer also represents The Virginian-Pilot on media access cases).
 Federal prosecutors contend Spirito lied four times under oath during the deposition, and they assert that handing the transcript to the agents was “an endeavor to obstruct and impede the due administration of justice."
 Prosecutors played about 15 minutes of the video during the recent trial, culled from five hours of deposition testimony, that they contend were lies.
 “Did the — this (People Express loan guarantee) result in the diversion of airport revenue?” Shumadine asks at one point.
 “That’s what I understand now," Spirito replied. “But ... when the audit came out, they made a determination that I guess some of the money that (airport finance director Renee Carr) transferred turned out to be airport revenue.”
 “Did you know that that was illegal?” Shumadine asked.
 “Oh, I’ve known it for my entire career,” Spirito said. “You cannot use airport revenue to subsidize an airline. ... I don’t transfer the money. So I wasn’t involved in the assessment of that. I only found out when I read the audit report, and subsequent to that I have no information to back up that assessment and determination by the auditors.”
 Spirito later said that he “never gave authorization to use airport revenue,” and that it must have been an unintentional “accounting error” by the finance director.
 “I told the board over and over again no airport revenue could be used to satisfy the loan guarantee," he said in the deposition. "It just couldn’t happen.”
 That contradicts what Carr testified to last week. She said that Spirito gave her explicit directions on which accounts could be used, including a handwritten note in her office.
 She did what Spirito wanted, she testified, because he was unhappy with her performance at the time and she was afraid of losing her job.
 Spirito is also charged with perjury for telling Shumadine during the March 2019 deposition that the board made the decisions on the loan.
 “I was the only one in the entire organization screaming by email to make changes, and no one wanted to listen to me because the Peninsula Airport Commission did what they wanted to do," he said.
 When Shumadine pressed the point, Spirito replied: “The board was in full control of all those decisions made. I had to carry out those decisions.”
 Spirito is also accused of lying when he told Shumadine he tried to warn the board against the risky loan guarantee.
 “I had told them several times in closed session you’re doing this knowing that that $5 million or whatever the number was, was going to go away,” Spirito told Shumadine. “That’s what happens when you make investments ... The risk was there all along, and I can’t help what the board ultimately decides."
 Shumadine asked if Spirito had a responsibility as the airport’s executive director to steer the board away from a bad deal.
 “I did advise them,” Spirito said. “I told them, ‘once you do this, you have to assume the money is gone,’ that this is risky. It’s $5 million. I mean, you could burn through that in a month if things don’t go right.”

Den Brusbach in Teilen umzuleiten oder stillzulegen, zog man ab den 1920er- Jahren zunehmend in Erwägung. In der näheren Umgebung häuften sich die Beschwerden, weil bei Hochwasser die Felder in Ufernähe überschwemmt wurden. Die bevorzugte Lösung der übergeordneten Regierung, nämlich die teilweise Aufhebung des Bachlaufes, scheiterte jedoch am Protest der Walsumer. Denn auf den rund fünf Kilometern, die das Gewässer durch Walsumer Gebiet floss, diente es bereits der Entwässerung Vierlindens.

THE next stage of Central Queensland’s $352 million Rookwood Weir project will start tomorrow.
 Natural Resources Minister Dr Anthony Lynham said local workers from Civil Mining and Construction would begin the $2.2 million Capricorn Highway intersection upgrade at Gogango on Tuesday.
 “This is more progress on Rookwood Weir – still only funded by the Palaszczuk Government,” Dr Lynham said.
 Member for Rockhampton Barry O’Rourke welcomed the local jobs and the latest milestone.
 “That’s 15 more CQ people who are part of a region-building project,” he said.
 Assistant Education Minister and Keppel MP Brittany Lauga said locals could expect ongoing jobs to flow, with a multi-million dollar bridge contract to be awarded next month.
 “Rookwood Weir is delivering for CQ already with jobs for locals, and tangible progress on site,” she said.
 The Gogango project will upgrade the road to provide safe access for large earthmoving machinery and construction vehicles travelling to the weir site.
 Meanwhile, the 25-strong Rockhampton Regional Council crew is making good progress on the $7.5 million upgrade at nearby Thirsty Creek Road.
 Work on culverts, floodways and cattle crossings two-thirds complete, while final road widening works are underway.
 The overall project is now nearly 30 per cent complete and on track for completion in June this year.
 Dr Lynham said the benefits of Rookwood Weir would extend well beyond the jobs.
 “It will provide opportunities for increased agricultural and industrial development, and jobs, as well as water security for the region,” he said.
 The successful tender for the main weir package is due to be announced in mid-2020, while the contract to upgrade Riverslea Bridge will be awarded in April.
 Sunwater CEO Nicole Hollows said work at Gogango was scheduled to be completed by mid-2020, weather permitting.
 Local businesses continue to register their interest to supply goods and services on the project’s dedicated web registry.
 About 136 Central Queensland businesses have already registered.
 Following last year’s project cost blowout and a failed request for the Federal Government to provide additional funding, the Queensland Government was forced to go back to the drawing board to redesign a scaled-down version of Rookwood Weir.

A spate of defaults by some NBFCs has forced capital market regulator SEBI to come out with a new set of measures to secure the interest of debenture holders and shore up their confidence in the regulatory mechanism to check any wrongdoings.
 In a new consultation paper, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has proposed a detailed review of the regulatory framework for Corporate Bonds and Debenture Trustees (DTs).
 According to the consultation paper, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) will now be required to create an identified charge on the assets, as the _pari passu_ floating charge in case of recent defaults of NBFCs in secured loans has created confusion as to whether the debentures are really secured.
 According to the regulator, creation of an identified charge by NBFCs will enable liquidation of asset and return of debt quickly to the investors in the event of any default. Recently, in the case of Reliance Capital, two trustees representing secured lenders had moved the court claiming rights on the same assets. The assets were charged to one trustee as part of the balance sheet and pledged to other trustee also.
 “SEBI’s new proposal will help avoid such situations in future and also help identify the charge, especially in case of default or liquidation. This would also expedite further borrowings by NBFCs by obviating the need of obtaining NOCs from existing lender,” said an official with a debenture trustee.
 ## Apprehensions
 Some market players have expressed apprehensions as to whether the new form of charge creation would be applicable on existing debentures or future borrowing.
 “Apparently, it seems that it would be applicable only on future borrowings so as to avoid operational difficulties,” a market expert said. SEBI has also proposed a transition time of 3-5 years, keeping in mind that the existing charge created over the entire balance sheet would continue till the maturity of already issued debentures, which is mostly between 3-5 years.
 Market experts also feel that the creation of an identified charge on the balance sheet will not cause any problem to the existing investors as the issuers would ensure that their asset cover is more than 100 per cent.
 SEBI has further proposed creation of a recovery fund by the issuer at the time of issuance of security. This will mitigate delay in receipt of funds to the debenture trustees and ensure enforcement of security. “SEBI’s new proposal will help bring back the confidence of investors in the bond market,” said another expert.
 The consultation paper is open for comments till March 17.

The 2020 XFL schedule continues on Sunday as the DC Defenders host the St. Louis Battlehawks and the LA Wildcats host the Tampa Bay Vipers. The total for Defenders vs. Battlehawks is 39, while Wildcats vs. Vipers has an over-under of 40, so finding value in the XFL DFS player pool on Sunday could be a challenge. However, with plenty on the line in XFL daily fantasy tournaments, cash games and 50-50s on sites like FanDuel and DraftKings, you'll want to leave no stone unturned as you enter your Week 5 XFL DFS picks.
 Can reigning Player of the Week Jordan Ta'amu keep his hot streak going after leading the BattleHawks to a win over the Dragons? And what potential XFL DFS stacks should you target on Sunday? Before you make your Week 5 XFL DFS picks, be sure to check out the optimal XFL DFS strategy from SportsLine's Mike McClure. He's won almost $2 million in his career as a daily Fantasy pro, and his top daily Fantasy football picks and XFL DFS advice can help you get an edge over the competition in Week 5.
 McClure has a proven track record of daily Fantasy football success. He crushed the 2018 NFL season, cashing in the top 5 percent of tournaments on FanDuel and DraftKings multiple times. His optimal lineups cashed as high as the top 0.1 percent on FanDuel and as high as the top 1 percent on DraftKings.
 He rolled through the 2019 NFL season as well. Some of his highlights included his Week 5 optimal lineups finishing in the top 1 percent of tournament on DraftKings. In Week 9, his optimal lineups cashed for over 5x on FanDuel and DraftKings. His Week 13 main slate lineups returned at least 10x on DraftKings and produced returns as high as 40x in higher-stakes tournaments. He then continued his roll in the postseason, cashing on every single lineup he posted for the divisional round.
 Then in Week 1 of the XFL, his Saturday FanDuel lineup, which was built around Houston Roughnecks quarterback P.J. Walker (272 yards, 4 TDs), returned over 5x. Anybody who has followed him as seen huge returns.

Not known for his biting humor. Adlai Stevenson found himself in a situation in California where someone at a campaign rally needled him to the point where his take on the man was this: "He is the only man I know who could chop down a giant sequoia and stand on the stump and deliver a speech on conservation."
   
 I cite this quip because Trump immediately came to mind when I read it.
   
 King Con Don is, at best, a stand-up tragicomedian, whose ill-fated humor often dies beyond his adoring crowds at campaign rallies. At worst, he is an utter failure as director of a White House reality show that must be canceled for bad acting, scripts, stage props and the worst directing in American history.
   
 At the voting booth, no matter who the candidate is facing him, the people must convey the message "You're fired!" And, "Go back and compete with the Kardashians!"
   
 Or the alternative is bleak. Currently we're not living in a vibrant democracy of healthy checks and balances. Rather, we seem to be living restlessly in an emergent Christian nationalist state of unhealthy Trump-checks and gross imbalances.
   
 Maybe a real political revolution could be an evolution of political thought, backed by meaningful action, not angry words leading to worthless inaction.

SURPRISE, Ariz. -- Kansas City Royals infielder/outfielder Hunter Dozier headed back to Texas this offseason not knowing for sure what the plans looked like for him defensively in 2020.
   
 A finalist for starting third baseman in the American League All-Star fan vote, he finished last season having played 20 games in the outfield after July 27. During the MLB Winter Meetings, Royals general manager Dayton Moore alluded to the possibility of Dozier shifting to the outfield on a regular basis.
   
 Later that month when the club closed in on a deal with free-agent third baseman Maikel Franco, Dozier got word that he'd be moving to the outfield on a near full-time basis.
   
 So far this spring, the transition has gone well and the 6-foot-4, 220-pound Dozier hasn't looked noticeably out of place roaming the outfield. He's taken the move in stride.
   
 It doesn't hurt that he's sharing the outfield with a former third baseman who made a similar transition in seven-time Gold Glove winner Alex Gordon.
   
 "It's extremely different," Dozier said. "I've come into camps before and they've told me just to work out at first for right now, but I was still taking ground balls. So this camp, I'm really not taking any ground balls. I think I took ground balls the very first day when I first reported before camp even started. That's the last time I took ground balls.
   
 "It's definitely different, but like I told them and I'm telling everyone -- whatever they want me to do, whatever they need me to do, I'm more than happy to do it. So right now it looks like they need me in the outfield. I'm enjoying it out there. It is different, but I am liking it out there."
   
 Up until this year, playing third base had largely defined Dozier's daily routine. In 2018, he started an extensive pregame routine working on his hands and footwork and taking ground balls to improve his skills with the help of former bench coach Dale Sveum and former third base coach Mike Jirschele.
   
 That daily pregame workload factored into the thought process of the Royals front office when deciding to move him to the outfield. The thinking being that the amount of energy he'd expend on a daily basis could potentially take away from his offensive production.
   
 Last season, Dozier made the Opening Day roster for the first time in his career, and he went on to record a slash line of .279/.348/.522 with 26 home runs and 84 RBIs.
   
 He also scored 75 runs and hit 29 doubles and 10 triples. He tied for the major league lead in triples along with teammates Adalberto Mondesi, Whit Merrifield and Arizona's Eduardo Escobar.
   
 "I'm watching him during the BPs, he really takes the life off the bats seriously," Royals manager Mike Matheny said. "He's getting some really good jumps. Every time he's had an opportunity, he's been sharp. He's just so athletic. He moves so well."
   
 Dozier, 28, said this offseason he adjusted his training to include fewer ground balls and an added focus on stretching his throwing arm out, running, getting his legs conditioned and even some little outfield drills.
   
 "I feel good out there," Dozier said. "I've still got a lot to learn. It's been nice that I've only been out there this spring. I've really been able to fully commit to being an outfielder and get comfortable out there. I've still got a long ways to go, but I'm feeling better."
   
 Third base skills
   
 Dozier has tried to translate some of his third base skills to his new position. Getting good reads and jumps off the bat are still important, just in a slightly different way.
   
 "I told him to take your aggressiveness charging the ball and coming up and throwing it," Gordon said. "I feel like I don't have the strongest arm, but what I did take from third base days was I was always good at charging the ball as quickly as possible and reading the hops. I think that's maybe where I get my outfield assists from, taking good angles, being aggressive, charging the ball. I think that comes from my third base days. I told him to try take that because he was kind of like me over there at third."
   
 Gordon has described himself as a "failed third baseman" in the past. After initially breaking into the majors as a third baseman, Gordon went back to the minors and made the transition along with the help of first base coach Rusty Kuntz.
   
 This winter, Gordon collected his seventh Gold Glove as a left fielder. He's one award behind Frank White for the most in franchise history.
   
 Gordon spoke highly of the transition Dozier has made thus far, and Gordon also pointed out that Dozier hasn't complained about what can be a less labor- intensive workday for the outfielders.
   
 "It's easier as far as the load management, the work," Gordon said. "There's been a couple times in spring training where the infielders are still working and the outfielders are kind of done with their stuff where he's like, 'Man, this is easy out here.' It's easier in that regard, but there's definitely things you've got to learn and ask questions."
   
 One area Dozier hasn't gotten completely comfortable with is hard-hit balls high in the air over his head.
   
 He's still not always sure whether to take his eye off the ball and run to a spot or keep tracking on the move. He's also trying to develop a knack for judging which balls will sail over the wall, hit off the wall or bounce short of the wall.
   
 Gordon said that will all come through repetitions, and he's urged Dozier to make shagging balls in batting practice as game-like as possible, especially when they go on the road and he'll have to get acclimated to the dimensions of different ballparks.
   
 Both Dozier and Gordon suggested spring training in Arizona may be one of the best training grounds possible because of the conditions that play havoc on outfielders when fly balls go up into the desert skies.
   
 "It's a lot harder just because of the high skies, the sun, the wind," Gordon said. "It definitely makes the season seem a lot easier. You get in the big league ballpark and the lighting is a lot better too. It's a little harder down here. It's good when you start the season."
