The more chaotic things get, the harder it is for people with clinical anxiety and or depression to make sound decisions and to learn from their mistakes.On a positive note, overly anxious and depressed people's judgment can improve if they focus on what they get right, instead of what they get wrong, suggests a new UC Berkeley study.The findings in the journal eLife, are particularly salient in the face of a Covid-19 surge that demands tactical and agile thinking to avoid illness and even death.UC Berkeley researchers tested the probabilistic decision-making skills of more than 300 adults, including people with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.In probabilistic decision making, people, often without being aware of it, use the positive or negative results of their previous actions to inform their current decisions.The researchers found that the study participants whose symptoms intersect with both anxiety and depression -- such as worrying a lot, feeling unmotivated or not feeling good about themselves or about the future -- had the most trouble adjusting to changes when performing a computerised task that simulated a volatile or rapidly changing environment.Conversely, emotionally resilient study participants, with few, if any, symptoms of anxiety and depression, learned more quickly to adjust to changing conditions based on the actions they had previously taken to achieve the best available outcomes."When everything keeps changing rapidly, and you get a bad outcome from a decision you make, you might fixate on what you did wrong, which is often the case with clinically anxious or depressed people," said study senior author Sonia Bishop, a professor of neuroscience at UC Berkeley."Conversely, emotionally resilient people tend to focus on what gave them a good outcome, and in many real-world situations that might be key to learning to make good decisions," added Bishop.That doesn't mean people with clinical anxiety and depression are doomed to a life of bad decisions, Bishop said. For example, individualized treatments, such as cognitive behaviour therapy, could improve both decision-making skills and confidence by focusing on past successes, instead of failures, she noted.The study expands on Bishop's 2015 study, which found that people with high levels of anxiety made more mistakes when tasked with making decisions during computerised assignments that simulated both stable and rapidly changing environments.Conversely, non-anxious study participants quickly adjusted to the changing patterns in the task.For this latest study, Bishop and her team looked at whether people with depression would also struggle to make sound decisions in volatile environments and whether this would hold true when challenged with different versions of the task."We wanted to see if this weakness was unique to people with anxiety, or if it also presented in people with depression, which often goes hand in hand with anxiety. We also sought to find out if the problem was a general one or specific to learning about potential reward or potential threat," Bishop said. The first experiment involved 86 men and women aged between 18 and 50. The group included people diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, people who showed symptoms of anxiety or depression, but no formal diagnoses of these disorders, and people with neither anxiety nor depression.In a laboratory setting, study participants played a game on a computer screen in which they repeatedly chose between two shapes -- a circle and a square.One shape, if selected, would deliver a mild to moderate electrical shock, and another would deliver a monetary prize. The probability of a shape delivering a reward or a shock was predictable at some points in the task, and volatile in others. Participants with high levels of symptoms common to depression and anxiety had trouble keeping pace with these changes.In the second experiment, 147 US adults, with varying degrees of anxiety and depression were recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing marketplace and given the same task remotely.This time, they chose between red and yellow squares on a screen. They still received monetary rewards, but instead of being penalized with electric shocks, they lost money.The results echoed those of the in-laboratory outcomes. Overall, having symptoms common to both anxiety and depression predicted who would struggle most with making sound decisions in the face of changing circumstances, regardless of whether they were rewarded or punished for getting things right or wrong, compared to their emotionally resilient counterparts."We found that people who are emotionally resilient are good at latching on to the best course of action when the world is changing fast," Bishop said."People with anxiety and depression, on the other hand, are less able to adapt to these changes. Our results suggest they might benefit from cognitive therapies that redirect their attention to positive, rather than negative, outcomes," added Bishop.

The Mughal emperorHumayun chilled summer fruit juice into a frozen sherbet in the mid-1500s. He used ice shavings from huge blocks of ice he transported on muleback from Kashmir to the capital city of Delhi. To keep it from melting, the ice was treated with potassium nitrate, otherwise known as saltpetre. By the 18th century the Mughals were so dependent upon ice for chilling both food and palaces that they built large "baraf khana," or ice houses, to store the product.

HILO, Hawaii (AP) — A new cancer treatment center in Hawaii has broken ground after the state legislature allocated $6.5 million for the project earlier this year. A group of healthcare officials and lawmakers gathered Thursday to mark the beginning of construction of the new building, which will expand the Hawaii Health System Corporation’s East Hawaii Health Clinic and is expected to be completed by 2022. The two-story facility of nearly 20,000 square feet (1,858 square meters) will be located adjacent to the existing clinic and across the street from the Hilo Medical Center. It will provide expanded oncology care, primary care and other specialty services, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported. “We’ve been on a long journey to get more healthcare here,” said Dan Brinkman, the Hawaii Health System Corporation's East Hawaii Regional CEO. “Our thing is great health care close to home, and you have to have a good facility to do that. You have to have space. As with many things here, it takes a long time to get that together and get support.” Democratic state Rep. Mark Nakashima said a visit to the facility more than a year ago showed him why the center needed to be expanded to meet demand for specialty care. Jerry Gray, the chairman of the East Hawaii Region Board of Directors, said the expansion would help prevent residents from having to fly off the island for specific treatment. “I think the COVID thing has brought home the importance of having access to services on the island, because anyone that’s traveled knows it’s difficult,” Gray said. \"This will just be better for our kupuna and for our keiki and all of us that make the Big Island home.”

Principals of schools in the national capital are not in favour of scrapping nursery admissions for next year in view of the COVID-19 pandemic even as the government maintains that no final decision has been taken yet in this regard. Usually, the process to enter children in nursery in around 1,700 schools in Delhi begins in last week of November. The Directorate of Education (DoE) releases guidelines and schools are asked to furnish required information following which the application process is rolled out usually in December. However, there has been no development on it this year.According to a senior Delhi government official, since the schools have been closed since nine months due to COVID-19 and will remain closed till a vaccine is available, a whole year of online learning for small children seems unviable."The government has decided that schools will not reopen in Delhi till a vaccine is available. Even if they reopen, pre-primary students will be the last ones to start going to school. So, its unviable to enrol them for an year of online learning," the official said."However, no final decision has been taken in this regard and any move will be planned in consultation with schools only," the official added.Reacting to the proposed idea, Alka Kapur, Principal, Modern School, Shalimar Bagh said, "I don't think it would be too prudent to cancel nursery admissions in the coming year. By getting their children enrolled in schools, the parents can, at the very least, introduce them to formal education. Even if they cannot attend the schools physically, they will have the option to learn online"."The pandemic has made it quite evident that we will be relying on technology for disseminating education in the future, and the sooner children are introduced to this hybrid way of teaching, the better they will fare in the long run." "Also, with the vaccine, things may begin to improve soon. Imagine if the pandemic begins subsiding by the June-July 2021, the entire year would go a waste if the nursery admissions are cancelled," she said.According to Sumedha Goel, Director, The Shri Ram Wonder Years, Rohini, scrapping the nursery admissions may not be a great step. "The growth of the children can suffer. Giving a halt to their growth for a year can be a setback to their holistic development. E-learning has emerged as the powerful tool to impact education even during this pandemic. Our teachers have various platforms and methods now to impart knowledge virtually. As per the response of the parents, the online methods have so far been successful," Goel said."Therefore, the decision to not make the children of nursery come to school will be better than scrapping the admissions of nursery," Goel said.Seema Kaur, Principal, Pacific World School, said, "It is not an advisable decision as doing away with schooling completely at a foundation level might only lead to an increase in the learning gap as school provides an environment for children to explore, gain a sense of self, interact and play with peers and build self confidence. Also, it is a known fact that 90 per cent of the child's brain develops during this age group"."Students who are eligible to take admission in Nursery in 2021-22 have never been to a play school and considering the pandemic it is quite likely that they have not developed the social and emotional skills that a child of grade nursery has." "Hence, it will be extremely challenging for students to adapt to the school environment when schools open physically. Even if schools open physically by July, effective online classes will bridge the learning gap and will help the students of Nursery to be ready for school," she said.Manit Jain, Co-founder of The Heritage Schools, believes it will be extremely traumatic for the families who have children going to nursery next year as they will have to rely on pre schools or take the decision of providing no education to their children for the a year. "A gap in the child's education is not recommended at this stage, as it is absolutely essential for the children's cognitive development and will lead to substantial gaps. Secondly, it will be challenging for the parents to make arrangements at this time or to seek education from preschools with teachers and staff who may not have the expertise to provide the children the support and resources that they need at this stage," he said."Thirdly, for the schools, it will add additional financial stress. What will the teachers for these grade levels do? This is in addition to an already difficult situation where the government has not approved fee increases in the last 3-4 years," added Jain who is also Chairman of FICCI ARISE, a collegium of stakeholders aimed at promoting quality education.

Chandigarh The Haryana cabinet on Wednesday approved the implementation of Delhi-Panipat Corridor of Regional Rapid Transport System (RRTS). The length of the Delhi-Panipat Corridor of RRTS is 103km and it will have 17 stations, including six in Delhi and 11 in Haryana. An official spokesperson said the construction and commissioning of the RRTS will be undertaken in two stages--Sarai Kale Khan to Murthal, including Murthal depot (58.28km) and Murthal to Panipat, including Panipat depot (44.74km). The cabinet approved gross contribution of ₹4,699 crore as the state government's share towards the project cost. It also nominated administrative secretary, town and country planning department as nodal officer for signing of agreements and other related documents with NCRTC for implementation of the project. Apart from this, the cabinet also authorised the chief minister to approve any changes or modifications, if they arise during consultation with NCRTC or Government of India for removing difficulties and bottlenecks in implementation of the RRTS project.New enterprises and employment policy approvedThe Haryana Enterprises and Employment Policy that aims at attracting over ₹1 lakh crore investment and generating 5 lakh jobs was also approved by the cabinet. The policy will focus on establishing Haryana as a competitive and favoured investment destination and building a resilient economy on the back of robust industrial growth, an official spokesperson said.The policy takes cognizance of emerging trends in supply chain, electric mobility, agri- tech, green manufacturing and climate change and healthcare and pharma and other new avenues for growth. In order to ensure timely delivery of services to the investors, 41 new services will be included in the Haryana Right to Services Act, 2014 and the single window system will be further strengthened with the integration of additional 36 new services. Keeping in view balanced regional growth, the state has been divided into four categories blocks (industrially developed, intermediate development, industrially backward areas and industrially most backward areas) based on industrial development. This policy places a special emphasis on development of the MSME sector and their business growth. It envisages bringing up a paradigm shift from being a regulator to a facilitator of MSMEs. To reduce the cost of doing business in the state and enhance industry competitiveness , the policy offers an array of attractive fiscal incentives to MSME, large, mega and ultra-mega enterprises. "The Ultra-Mega and Mega and Cluster projects as defined under this policy will also be considered by Haryana Enterprises Promotion Board (HEPB) for special package of incentives," said an official. Common cadre for Group-CThe cabinet also approved Haryana Group-C employees (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Bill, 2020 with the objective of creating a common cadre, equal promotion opportunities and stability of tenure. Under this move, a common cadre will be constituted for the Group-C employees of all the departments so that they get equal opportunities for further promotion and can be transferred from one department to another under online transfer policy on completion of prescribed tenure or earlier. Amendments in Affordable Housing PolicyThe cabinet approved amendments in the Affordable Housing Policy, 2013, increasing the maximum area limit of project from 10 acre to 30 acre while the minimum area limit for setting up of affordable group housing colony has been reduced from 5 acre to 4 acre. An official spokesperson said although the minimum area norm is being reduced from 5 acre to 4 acre, the coloniser will provide the community building as per the norms prescribed for 5 acre. As per the amendment, the commercial area has now been increased from 4% to 8% of Net Planned Area. The existing provision of providing 0.5 Equivalent Car Space (ECS) will continue to remain mandatory and non-chargeable. The coloniser will be allowed to provide additional 0.5 ECS parking space per dwelling unit, which will be optional, against which it can allot one car parking space for each dwelling unit. The coloniser will be allowed to recover not more than 5% of the cost of flat against such allotment of car parking space. In cases where licenses under AHP 2013 already stand granted and building plans stand approved without availing the optional 0.5 ECS per dwelling unit parking space, the colonisers will be required to submit the consent of at least two thirds of the allottees as per the rules.New MC for Manesar The state government has decided to constitute a new municipal corporation (MC) at Manesar in Gurugram district by including 29 villages adjoining it. The 29 villages of Manesar (rural and urban), Kasan, Khoh, Naharpur Kasan, Nawada, Fatehpur, Dhana, Baskusla, Basharia, Kankrola, Bhangrola, Dhorka, Wazirpur, Badha, Sikanderpur Rampur (situated in the revenue estate of Shikohpur village), Shikohpur, Nakhrola, Bar-Gujjar, Naurangpur, Meoka, Hayatpur, Sehrawan, Nainwal, Kukrola, Jhund Sarai (Viran), Jhund Sarai (Abad), Fazalwas, Gopalpur and Garhi-Harsar will be included in the limits of the newly created Manesar MC. With the inclusion of these villages, the required criterion of minimum population of three lakh will be fulfilled. The total area of the new corporation will be 124.32 square km, according to the present boundaries. At present, there are 87 municipalities in Haryana, including 10 municipal corporations, 19 municipal councils and 58 municipal committees. Faridabad metropolitan authority to be RTA for city bus services The Faridabad Metropolitan Development Authority will now act as the regional transport authority (RTA) for city bus services to be operated by the Faridabad City Transport Services Limited. The government approved the proposal of the department to declare the authority as RTA to specify the routes/areas for the grant of stage carriage permits. It will also issue a time table, working hours of the crew and parking places in respect of the city bus service to be operated by Faridabad City Transport Service Limited. The development authority will act as the RTA exclusively for the Faridabad City Transport Service Limited in respect of the operation of its city bus services in Faridabad. Panchayat tax at 2% of electricity bill The state government has decided to levy "panchayat tax" that will be 2% of the electricity bill. The new tax will be imposed on people within the limits of gram panchayats across the state. It will be applicable on electricity consumed by anyone except agriculture consumers and government. The CM said this move is expected to generate over ₹100 crore revenue. The panchayat tax will be collected by the Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN) and Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) and paid in the same manner as if it was electricity duty payable to the state government and same will be remitted to the concerned gram panchayat.

MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (WMBF) - Restaurant and bar owners across South Carolina are calling on Gov. Henry McMaster to lift the 11 p.m. “Last Call” order ahead of New Year’s Eve.It was put in place back in July in response to a statewide spike in COVID-19 cases.The South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association (SCRLA) sent a letter to McMaster. In it, the association claims restaurants are low risk when it comes to spreading the virus based on contact tracing data released by the state of New York.The letter went on to say the restaurant and hospitality industry is “suffering as a result of inconsistent, restrictive mandates.” This includes the Last Call order, which prohibits alcohol sales after 11 p.m.“We usually do drink promos, all types of fun stuff for that day, so it kind of sucks that we can’t do it right this year,” Billy Cargill, general manager of Beach House Bar and Grill, saidWith New Year’s Eve being one of the most profitable nights for restaurants and bars, some business owners in Myrtle Beach believe the restriction may put a damper on this year’s celebrations.“Why would all that extra money to have to shut everything down at 11 o’clock before the clock strikes 12 anyway?” Doane Widenhouse, general manager of Barrell Sports Bar and Grill, said.“We’re going to get 60% of people to come here around 9 o’clock and an hour and a half later turn them away,” Cargill said. “Kind of defeats the whole purpose of coming to a bar.”SCRLA said the National Restaurant Association estimates more than $240 billion will be lost in sales by the end of the year. Widenhouse said he’s lost 50% of revenue because of the order.“The little guy like me ... we don’t have any power or say so, but when you get a big organization like the South Carolina Restaurant Association standing up for us it’s a good thing,” he said.While restaurants want to see the order lifted, Cargill said he understands the pandemic has made it tough on everyone, including McMaster.“I love the idea of it,” Cargill said. “I just know he’s trying his best to keep everybody safe - customers and employees alike - so it’s kind of hard to judge from his perspective.”Copyright 2020 WMBF.
