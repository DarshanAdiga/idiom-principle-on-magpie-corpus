All persons entering the property at both tracks will be required to fill out a questionnaire and submit to a temperature check before entering the stable gate and if deemed a risk will be turned away. Once on the grounds you are required to wear face coverings at all times and gloves when practical, maintain social distancing, keep to a minimum number of people in the paddock and minimal contact with others while on the grounds.


  Only those horses ages three and up that are stabled on the grounds (including local farms designated by management) at each track or eligible to the NYSS will be accepted to qualify and race at Tioga and Vernon for the time being. Two-year-olds will be accepted for week two of qualifiers.


  Horses shipping in will be required to stable in the designated area and leave the grounds as soon as possible after qualifying or racing.


  Please keep the warming up to a minimum and keep a distance from others when on the track both warming up and scoring.


  Catch-drivers will have no contact with the handlers of the horses and will wait in their car in a designated parking area with no contact among themselves. They will pick up their mounts on the way to the track. Trainers that drive their own horses and have been working in the stables may participate in the preparation of the horses.


  It is strongly recommended that you sign up for Meadowlands, Tioga and Vernon mass text service as a lot of important information will be disseminated via text. To sign up, text the word “MEADOWLANDS” to the number 84700 on your mobile device. You may be required to respond “YES” if you receive a request for response.


  We need everyone to adhere to protocol exactly as required by the state. It is imperative that we do everything they ask to the very best of our ability so that we may continue to race. Enduring this temporary inconvenience is what must be done to get back to what we need to do and eventual easing of these restrictions.

I close my eyes in self isolation from corona… and I see myself yearning for certain incomplete goodbyes. The silent cries, empty messages, shallow promises and shattered beliefs coalesce and crystallize into a hollow portrait of my lover. I wonder if he thinks about me the way I do. Or does he remember my embrace or my voice? As the breeze hit my face and memories of a lost lover envelope me, I remind my heart to stop being a gramophone of his poems. I remind my brain to stop flashing our past moments which are like speck of dust on the shelf of nostalgia. I’m happy, I try to convince myself. Am I?. That’s one thing I will keep searching for. But somewhere ,with a wavering hope, I wish even he would miss me the way I do.

Thorsteinsdóttir also highlighted the unfortunate paradox that, while the arts are becoming increasingly important, many artists are struggling to adapt to the challenges of COVID-19. Thorsteinsdóttir specifically emphasized the contrast between the situation in the United States, where the arts are mostly funded by individual donors, to the one in Europe, where the arts benefit from government support.


  Due to a decrease in money from donors and limited government aid, many artists are struggling to remain relevant and sustain their careers while also trying to pay their rent, and according to Thorsteinsdóttir, the aftereffects of a pandemic have the potential to permanently change our relationship with art.


  “I think there’s a real shift in how we’re going to consume art going forward,” Thorsteinsdóttir said.


  Returning to the topic of her performance, Thorsteinsdóttir said that her music choice was, in part, inspired by the chaos in the world around her.


  “I guess I’ve been realizing how much we go towards comfort and, you know, the things we grew up on, and for me, Bach is definitely one of those things,” Thorsteinsdóttir said.


  Thorsteinsdóttir also reflected on the magic of music and the importance of performing it, even through difficult times.


  “Through 300 years, that music has been passed down and has been held onto and taught person to person to person,” Thorsteinsdóttir said. “I hope that we can continue to pass on the musical gifts to future generations.”

Ezra Klein argued in early April that with Covid-19 leaving millions of people’s employer-provided insurance up in the air, Biden should embrace something more like Buttigieg’s Medicare for All Who Want It or the Center for American Progress’s Medicare Extra program.

At the other end of the technology spectrum, people are also looking at higher-tech solutions as to how we might organise ourselves.


  "It's not just visual impairments, somebody with autism or dementia standing in a queue can feel the most amazing amount of anxiety," explains Gavin Neate of Neatbox.


  His app, which alerts businesses that someone who has a disability and might need help is on their way, was already up and running but he thinks it can help as we get used to the need for social distancing.


  "Increasingly there's an opportunity to actually provide a service where somebody will know who's just about to walk round the corner, before they walk round the corner and do the most important thing which is help the staff member help the disabled visitor."


  ## Providing shelter


  In communities across Scotland, there will be very individual things which people need to do to adapt - but also things they will have in common.


  Experts say there is room for both high and low-tech solutions and also ones which can work with the Scottish weather.

Another concern officials have is over people’s physical condition. Rob Sendak of the Washington State Parks Boating Program is worried about something he calls “quarantine fatigue.” With people cooped up indoors over the past few months, people may overestimate their abilities to swim. Sendak urges people to wear lifejackets in and around the water.


  “I wear this life vest a lot,” Sendak said. “I just try and be as evangelical as I can when it comes to putting one of these things on because it’s going to save your life, and that’s what we’re in the business of trying to do.”


  Many drownings occur for other reasons. Especially with college-aged individuals, alcohol and other substances can lead to many drownings which may have been prevented if the individual was not under the influence.


  “One of our primary functions, unfortunately, is to recover drowning victims,” Sgt. Mark Rorvik of the King County Sheriff’s Marine Rescue Dive Unit said. “We do see a lot of older teens. Drugs, alcohol, and marijuana can be a contributing factor. When you’re young, you think you’re invincible, but you’re not. So we recover a lot of younger men and women, unfortunately, that have taken unnecessary risks and drowned.”


  As for all of the safety officials, the importance of wearing a life jacket when on the water cannot be stressed enough. For individuals in paddle craft, it is a state law that one must have a life jacket and a noise-making device on board. Being without such is a punishable offense of $99.


  With temperatures heating up in the coming weeks, it is a good idea to check before you go, be aware of your capabilities as a swimmer, stay close to shore, and always wear a life jacket.

Even though the air temperatures of Seattle springtime commonly reach the 70s or even break 80 degrees, water takes a much longer time to heat up.


  “It is quite a lag for water to warm up,” meteorologist Ted Buehner said in a press conference May 20. “With regards to our lakes like Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish, the top couple of feet are gonna warm up, and usually by the end of August, maybe Labor Day weekend, maybe some places ... will finally reach 70 degrees.”


  The peak summertime temperatures in the Seattle area typically occur in late July, but the warmest water temperatures do not occur until the beginning of September. For now, lakes and rivers are currently in the 40 to 50 degree range, quite chilly compared to the average 85 degree pool.


  With a nice summer on deck, a 70% chance of being warmer than normal, safety officials are concerned that the summertime temperatures may lead to increased drownings in the cold waters.


  “Hypothermia does kill, but it’s really the cold water shock that is the most deadly,” Derek VanDyke of the Washington State Parks Boating Program said. “Imagine taking a shower and your son or child turns that water cold on you. You’re going to gasp when that cold water hits you. Now imagine you fall into the water from your boat unintentionally, you’re going to gasp, you’re going to aspirate, and you could swallow water and immediately drown.”


  VanDyke says drownings can occur within a minute of entering the water due to cold water shock. As a rule of thumb, VanDyke uses the one-ten-one rule. When immersed in cold water, the body stops pumping blood to its extremities in an attempt to keep the heart warm. This gives people about 10 minutes to swim to safety before the muscles cramp up and stop working. Within an hour, hypothermia can set in, which is another serious danger with long-term effects.

I have a few critiques. For example, I think the term “self-partnered” feeds into an often toxic narrative that places a relationship as the ultimate goal; in practice, self-partnering is less about the imitation of the revered monogamous love and more about the intentional commitment to oneself. I like that.


  “Self-partnering” is not necessarily “self-monogamy.” All it really means is that you are fulfilled by yourself and do not seek fulfillment from others. You can still date, have sex with, and even marry another person while self- partnered. The term is not just the hipper, more feminist little sister of the word “single.”


  If you want to be as cool as Emma Waston — and if you don’t, you obviously have never watched that girl stand in the bed of a truck in “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” — you need to put your happiness in your own hands.


  I find that we often allow others to dictate our happiness, be it with how fast they reply to our texts, with their commitment to our Snapchat streak, or with how many tweets they send us in a given afternoon.


  I get it. I get it more than anyone. We want to feel significant. But if you truly want to feel like you matter, you need to remind yourself that you matter to you. You’re the only constant in your life, and if you can validate your own existence, that shouldn’t be scary.


  Personally, I look for validation from others — proof of my significance — on social media. You post a cute selfie on your Snapchat story, and then you check back in to see if those select few you specifically cater to have seen it.

During the pandemic, many have extended gratitude to all first responders, health care workers and scientists who are on the front lines working day and night to care for anyone affected by COVID-19.


  From companies donating masks and ventilators to hospitals, to everyday people helping their neighbors, there are countless examples of people trying to do the right thing during an extraordinarily difficult time.


  Companies have shown how they are innovative and caring in the communities they serve.


  The idea for this column came after hearing how DTE Energy launched "Caring in the Crisis," an awareness effort aiming to make sure Detroit-area residents who need help know how to get it during the COVID-19 pandemic.


  The effort includes a series of public service announcements and digital messages encouraging DTE customers to contact the company to explore payment assistance and financial help options if they are experiencing a hardship due to COVID-19.


  It culminated with a May 22 "Day of Caring" radio event on Detroit stations WJLB, WDMK and WDMK HD2. The "Day of Caring" programming included messages from influential community leaders and elected officials, all encouraging Detroiters to take advantage of the help available to them.


  "Throughout this crisis, we have had one core message to our communities, and that's 'we're here to help you," said Angie Pizzuti, vice president and chief customer officer, DTE Energy. "There are many people who have never had problems making ends meet, and now are experiencing income loss and don't know where to turn. We want to connect with them right away to deliver the help that DTE and the state have made available to them."


  DTE formed partnerships with local faith-based leaders, elected officials and human service agencies to create messaging for the campaign, which will be seen and heard on the participating radio stations, social media outlets and other digital channels throughout May.


  DTE Energy has taken multiple actions to respond to customer needs during the COVID-19 crisis, including financial aid and distribution on personal protection equipment.


  Across our communities, the DTE Energy Foundation is fully activated to respond to the COVID-19 crisis, the press release continues.


  The information said the foundation has donated 2 million respiratory masks to first responders and medical professionals.


  In the first month of the crisis, the foundation supported one million meals, basic needs for 100,000 families and helped 400 small businesses with grants. The Foundation also launched a matching grant program for the Michigan Association of United Ways and Michigan Action that has resulted in nearly $1 million in public donations to date.


  In addition, the foundation is matching donations by DTE Energy employees, contractors and retirees to nonprofits across Michigan, including faith-based organizations.


  This is just one example showing how caring in crisis is apparent all over Michigan.


  As one who appreciates working for a caring company, I can only hope others have felt the same where they work. Because when crisis happens, caring for employees and others should be a top priority.


  Reaching them, keeping them informed with important updates and the information they need to stay safe and feel connected to the organization goes a long way in showing employees they matter.


  Evidence shows care is related to lower stress and burnout. When employees feel their organization cares, it's been found that 50 percent say their stress is manageable (compared to 14 percent of those who don't feel care).


  This goes to show that effective communication, leadership and manager support, along with activities centered around helping people stay informed, healthy and safe are the first steps to both uniting companies and maximizing living conditions during a crisis.

The demand for dry eye medications has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in pharmacies and wholesalers reporting many drugs being out of stock. Owing to the shortage of medications, governments are advising pharmacists to limit the dispensing of certain dry eye prescription medicines such as chloramphenicol (an antibiotic for conjunctivitis) eye drops and ointments to a one-month supply according to the prescribed dose. Also, pharmacists are recommended to sell certain over the counter medicines (OTC) to a maximum of one unit per purchase, due to concerns over significant health impacts on patients which can occur if there is shortage of medicines during this pandemic.

WALPOLE--With schools shuttered in March through to at least June, plants growing at the Norfolk County Agricultural High School for its annual plant sale were left in limbo until the three-pronged Aggie Abundance program was formulated by staff and administrators.


  First up, the plants students had started to grow after February vacation that were slated for the annual plant sale to raise approximately $20,000 for the school each year. While groundskeeper Patrick Collins kept them going for three weeks after schools were closed in addition to his other jobs, plant science teacher Jeff Thompson and others stepped in to help when they were allowed back on campus.


  In all, 100 plants were delivered to Norwood Hospital staff, 50 plants to the Walpole Fire Department, and 50 plants to the Walpole Police Department, all on the Friday before Mother's Day as a way to thank first responders.


  "They were so appreciative," Thompson said. "It made me feel great to help them because they do so much for the community."


  Part two for the Aggie Abundance initiative is to distribute plants to school families after the school grounds are planted. While students typically would be helping with the beautification of the campus, Thompson said it is school staff that will be doing the work this time.


  "We plant the campus to the nines," Thompson said. "It really looks beautiful. If seniors do get a chance to walk and receive their diplomas, we want it to look nice for them. There's a lot of pride in our school and I think it's reflected in how it looks."


  Teacher Lisa Collins said they put in the extra effort to make the campus appealing because a large number of people from the community walk around the campus.


  "It's like a public park," Collins said. "It's kind of a shining jewel in the county."


  She said a survey was sent out to families to see who could come pick up plants and who needed a delivery.


  "Everything will already be pre-boxed so when they arrive, we put them in their trunk," Collins said. "We're very mindful of making this a safe distribution."


  For the third initiative, Thompson said the school will be planting a Covid Victory Garden instead of the usual pumpkins that are planted on 1.5 acres of land for the annual haunted hay rides.


  He said last year they received a donation of 1,500 packages of seeds from the University of Rhode Island and he has planted everything, some 10,000 plants, in the school's greenhouses.


  Peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, kale and other durable vegetables that do not require a lot of refrigeration will be grown and distributed to school families first, and then food pantries, for those who are struggling and will possibly continue to struggle with the economic fallout from the pandemic and job losses.


  "We're hoping to offset some food shortages and food insecurities," Thompson said. "The idea is, 'let's not waste any of this stuff, let's get it out to people who need it.'"


  Collins said the Covid Victory Garden will supply a free weekly Farmer's Market for Aggie families.


  "We already have staff ready to deliver to families that don't have a car," Collins said. "We don't want somebody's economic status to inhibit them from participating in the program."


  She said they will also be coordinating with the Walpole Food Pantry and Abundant Harvest to see who might be in need of what so any extra crops will not be wasted.


  Thompson said the initiative is in line with what the school was moving toward before the pandemic hit, namely the reintroduction of growing food on campus, with students running the program with staff support.


  "It they come back in September, there will be plenty for the kids to go out and pick," Thompson said.


  Thompson points to the collaboration between staff and administration as the key to bringing all the ideas to fruition and Collins agrees.


  "The Aggie is an excellent place to work even during times of quarantine," Collins said. There's a lot of good going on."

It’s odd, the things that we once gave such pure, intense focus and devotion to for months on end. Then suddenly the wind shifts and off we go on a new tack. And for far too long, these earlier interests or passions sadly fall by the wayside and recede into the vast recesses of some hoarder’s crawlspace in the brain cloaked in heaps of the other things that my skull had no room for…until recently. I found this painting, which I had started in 2006 … for 14 years I’d never touched the painting – the occasional glance, at best. Yet it somehow always lingered in my mind, this piece of unfinished business. Even while we are forced to live in the immediate, some strange species of the interrupted passion that has been invested in an object we once focused on awaits our return from far away. I will keep you apprised of the progress! All Love, JD

In the 2016 cycle when Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders disagreed about raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, the debate was the subject of extensive coverage. By the 2020 cycle, all the major Democratic candidates were on board, so it didn’t come up much. But it’s significant that this is no longer controversial in Democratic Party circles. If the party is broadly comfortable with the wage hike as a matter of both politics and substance, Democrats in Congress are likely to make it happen if it’s at all possible.

4\. Give yourself extra time to warm up in your first 2 weeks back to training Many lifters in the gym don’t do any warm-up whatsoever before hitting the weights hard. This is a bad idea whether you’ve been lifting consistently or not. In some cases, lifters will warm up with a quick jog on a treadmill or bike. This isn’t much more effective than doing nothing, to be honest.


  Instead, when you enter the gym, begin by loosening up the joints with some calisthenics, then do a light set of 10-15 for all the main joints: something where the hips flex and extend (deadlift variation), something where the knees flex and extend (squat variation), a couple for the elbows (curl and push- down variations), and something for the main movement patterns of the shoulders (bench press variation, overhead press variation, row variation, and pull-down variation).


  If you start this habit of warming up the actual major joints of the body now, when you get back into the Iron Jungle, your workouts will be better overall, and will continue to improve as you get better at learning what your body needs to properly warm up.


  5\. Cut your workout off at 45 minutes.


  Many of you will want to go in there and hit marathon sessions, to try to make up for lost time. Bad idea.


  Don’t go in there and do too much, right off the bat. Have yourself a solid session, but commit to cutting it off at 45 minutes. This limits the amount of damage done to the muscles, reduces the soreness you’ll experience, and helps you recover for the next session. After a couple weeks, feel free to bump the length of your workouts up to an hour or so.


  6\. Stretch everything out before you leave the gym.


  Give yourself 5 minutes to stretch everything out before you hit the road. There are all kinds of stretches you can do, and you probably remember some from when you played sports in high school.


  Something for the chest, shoulders, back, and the legs is going to make you feel a lot better than getting into the car right after the workout and having the muscles cool down in the shortened, tensed position they’re in after a hard workout. Take 5 minutes, stretch out, and you’ll feel like a million bucks and be ready to kill it the next time you hit the gym.


  Friends, it’s been a while, but there seems to be an end in sight. I’m right there with you in wanting to get everybody back into the gym, but you HAVE TO go about it the right way, when you get back there.


  And if the thought of getting back into it all alone is weighing heavily on your mind, then hit me up through Facebook, and we can lay out your plan for getting active again at my gym, PEAK Strength & Fitness in Wyalusing PA.

It’s scary because it seems like a lot of people are rushing back in, going super heavy on the big lifts, and testing their MAXES on the first day back.


  After a 2+ month layoff, the last thing you want to do is go back into the gym and see how much weight you can put up on your favorite lifts. That’s a surefire recipe for an injury, and if that happens, you’ll be right back on the shelf again.


  So, today, I want to give you some advice as to how you can get back into the gym and safely ramp yourself back up to heavy lifting.


  1\. Go into it assuming you’ve lost some strength and BE OK WITH IT!


  Most people will not be able to retain their strength after a 2-month layoff. So there’s no need to go in there and test your max to prove that fact even further. Instead, for safety’s sake, don’t even dream of going in there and trying to test your 1 Rep Max on anything at all.


  These first couple weeks, you need to have your head on right. It’s gonna be hard lift the weights you’re used to throwing around, but that’s ok. If it was easy, everybody would do it. The hard is what makes it great. (Yes, I watched “A League of Their Own” recently, since there’s no baseball on TV right now… please don’t hate on me for quoting it)


  2\. Your main objective is re-establishing your foundation.


  A house built on rock is stronger than one built on sand. Your job over the next two weeks is to build a nice solid foundation for your future training by staying away from heavy weights and gravitating toward moderate ones, in order o build a new foundation that is rock solid.


  You’ll do this by doing more individual sets that you normally would, and fewer repetitions per set. So, if you’re accustomed to doing 3 sets of 10-12 for each exercise, try doing 5-6 sets of 6 to 8 reps with a little lighter weights. This will help you lay out a foundation that is solid, upon which you can build a stable skyscraper of muscle gains.


  3\. You’re gonna be SORE no matter what.


  Unless you’ve been hitting it hard in your makeshift home gym during lockdown, your muscles are deconditioned. This means no matter what you do, your muscles are going to be hurting once you get back into it. With this in mind, consider doing more body parts per workout, or even working out your whole body, in your first couple of weeks, in order to spread the emphasis out over more area. That way, there’s less breakdown of individual tissues, and less soreness overall.

Given the extent to which Biden has run as a candidate of continuity and restoration rather than revolution, there’s good reason to doubt exactly how much appetite for pushing the envelope in this regard he really has. But a much more favorable view of unions is in line with the evolving thinking of mainstream Democratic Party economic policy hands, so it’s not out of the question by any means.
