When a reporter asked China’s envoy to Britain during a news conference Monday about books being removed, Liu replied that it “depends on what the book is about.″
 If a book aims to incite secession or subversion, “you know that will be tantamount to a kind of crime,″ he said.
 During his news conference, Liu also needled British officials about reconsidering their decision to grant Chinese tech giant Huawei a limited role supplying new high-speed network equipment to wireless carriers. Britain is reportedly poised to backtrack on the initial approval following U.S. government warnings that it would sever an intelligence-sharing arrangement if the U.K. did not ban Huawei.
 Liu said that “Britain can only be great’’ when it has an independent foreign policy and that it sets a bad precedent to “make your policy in the morning and change it in evening.’’ He said that while he believed Huawei would simply do business elsewhere, other Chinese companies might think twice about investment into the U.K.

 Many local producers harvested their cereal rye or other winter small grain crops as baleage or haylage. However, some farmers still are looking forward to harvesting those crops for grain and making some much-needed straw as well.  
 Those fields harvested for forage are likely now in corn or soybeans. But, if you are planning on harvesting grain in the next couple weeks or if you have oats coming off soon either as forage or grain, below are a few considerations to follow those crops.  
 Oats as a forage have received a lot of attention in research plots recently. Oats as grain, forage and even straw are highly palatable. An article by Jason Hartschuh and Al Gahler, OSU Extension Educators, discussed the findings of one such study. The current recommendation includes planting 2-3 bu. per acre in early August, applying 50 lbs. of nitrogen per acre, and keeping a close watch on recommendations for a preventative fungicide treatment against rust. Severe presence of rust will negatively impact all aspects of forage quality.  
 Field trials receiving 50 lbs. of nitrogen had an average crude protein test of 14% compared to 10% without added nitrogen. Dry matter yields averaged 1 to 1.5 ton per acre with 3 tons being quite possible under favorable conditions. You may consider purchasing a forage variety of oats as compared to the typical spring sown varieties to maximize yield. Recently, double cropping with oats has been equally or more profitable than double crop soybeans.  
 Summer planted oats are typically cut between the boot and early dough stage, partially dried, and then ensiled as wrapped round bales. Oats also can be effectively grazed and occasionally baled dry. Drying may take up to six days in the fall with multiple tedding and raking passes.  
 Warm season, C-4 grasses, like sorghum, sorghum-sudangrass, and pearl millet are beginning to gain attention in the Midwest as another forage option following winter cereal crops. Ideally, these would be planted the same time as corn, though they can be successfully established through mid-July. Care must be taken in harvesting or grazing these at the recommended height as nitrate and prussic acid poisoning are a concern. Multiple cuts or grazing passes can be made off these. Harvest or graze when the plants reach 15-20 inches in height (18-24 for sorghum-sudangrass). Staggering the planting dates in a grazing situation will improve utilization.  
 Grazing allows a wider selection of plant species to consider for summer forage seedings. Some mixed stands simply do not work well in mechanical harvesting systems. You may want to include brassicas like forage turnips or radishes which are highly digestible, field peas or cow peas which are high in protein and can fix nitrogen in the soil, oats or buckwheat -- quick to germinate and establish while also an excellent scavenger of phosphorous (ideal in areas with excessive and repeated manure application).  
 You may also consider leaving those crops a true cover crop by not harvesting them at all. This strategy also improves weed control. In this case, choose plant species you are prepared to terminate and pair species with similar termination strategies. Brassicas, oats, peas and buckwheat will all winter kill. Clovers, rye, barley and vetch do not winter kill and require an herbicide application or intensive mechanical tillage to terminate. Buckwheat should be terminated at flowering to prevent seed production that may germinate in your cash crops the following year.  
 To help with selecting the forages that best fit your operation, consider getting a copy of the Midwest Cover Crop guide as it provides great details on many species outside of our typical cash crops. The online Midwest Cover Crop Decision Tool is another great resource.  
 Before double cropping or seeding a cover crop, consult your crop insurance agency as some management strategies may affect your eligibility to receive payments on cash crops.  
 In addition to soil health benefits, grant funding through the Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District is another incentive. Applicants must have aerial maps, soil tests within the past four years, and records of applied nutrients (commercial and manure). First time applicants may receive $15/acre and returning applicants are eligible for $12/acre up to 200 acres per operation. Registration for 2020 ends July 10. Call Wayne County Soil and Water at 330-263-5376 to apply.  
 As with any crop, having a plan in place and doing your homework for planting, harvest, and storage options is key to meeting your goals. Contact the Wayne County Extension office for more information by calling 330-264-8722.

BATON ROUGE -- The federal government is setting up four new drive-thru coronavirus testing sites in Louisiana's capital city, which is seeing spikes in confirmed cases of the COVID-19 disease.
   
 Baton Rouge's mayor, Sharon Weston Broome, said the sites will open Tuesday and operate seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., with a goal of testing as many as 5,000 people a day. The federally-supported test locations, which will use a self-administered nasal swab, will remain up and running through July 18.
   
 "This rapid increase in testing is one of the most important things we can do right now to protect public health and our local economy. Knowing if you have COVID-19 and what to do to prevent further spreading the virus will save lives and lessen the economic impact in our community," Broome said in a statement. "I implore our residents to take advantage of these testing sites if they have symptoms or were exposed to COVID-19."
   
 Broome enacted a mask requirement last week for anyone entering a business around the city, as the region sees sizable increases in virus cases and hospitalizations, including an outbreak traced to a cluster of bars near the Louisiana State University campus.
   
 The new testing sites -- located at LSU, Southern University, Cortana Mall and the local fairgrounds -- will be supported by the Louisiana National Guard and other state agencies. Results are expected to take three to five days, according to the mayor's office.
   
 As businesses reopened around Louisiana, the state has seen a sharp uptick in confirmed cases of COVID-19 and patients who are hospitalized with complications from the disease.
   
 The state isn't near the height of its outbreak in April, when public health officials worried that hospitals would run out of space. But Gov. John Bel Edwards and others have warned that trends are pointing in that direction, with too many people ignoring the precautions that slow infections.
   
 Nearly 3,200 Louisiana residents have died from COVID-19, according to the state health department.
   
 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up within weeks. But for some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe or fatal illness.
   
 Louisiana has more than 65,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Public health experts say the actual infection rate is expected to be much higher because many people don't experience significant symptoms and others never get tested.

A federal judge issued a two-week restraining order Monday, July 6, suspending Graham's restrictive protest ordinance as part of an agreement between city officials and the sheriff on one side and Alamance NAACP and the ACLU of North Carolina on the other.
   
 The state ACLU, county branch of the NAACP and eight identified plaintiffs sued July 2, claiming the "two or more" protest ordinance violates their First and 14th Amendment rights of free speech and due process. Defendants, including Mayor Jerry Peterman, Police Chief Jeff Pritchard and Sheriff Terry Johnson, did not oppose a temporary restraining order pending further orders from the court. The next hearing will be July 20.
   
 For years the city has used the ordinance to move groups of self-appointed protectors of the Confederate monument in front of the Historic Courthouse off city sidewalks, and to keep demonstrators out of Court Square. Efforts to start demonstrations have intensified since the killing May 25 of George Floyd and renewed antagonism toward Confederate symbols. The named plaintiffs claim the ordinance prevented them from organizing or participating in protests in Graham.
   
 The ordinance requires a permit for "two or more" people protesting or stating a position, gives the police chief broad authority to deny permits, and even allows the chief to limit the size of a permitted demonstration to six people and prohibit minors from participating.
   
 In a Facebook post apparently written Sunday by Peterman and later taken down, he wrote, "We are being sued by some of the very people we set out to protect."
   
 The Alamance Branch of the NAACP did not respond to a Times-News question about whether and when it intends to hold demonstrations in Graham, and the Sheriff's Office has not said whether it will take any additional security measures at the monument.
   
 This does not appear to be the end of legal action. Elizabeth Haddix, managing attorney at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was quoted in an ACLU news release saying the group would next take action to allow protests closer to the monument, which is under the jurisdiction of the Sheriff's Office.
   
 "What remains now is to get rid of the unlawful restriction of protesters' rights to exercise their First Amendment rights on the courthouse grounds at the Confederate monument site," Haddix said.

En todo caso, no esta solo nuestro Tribunal a la hora de apreciar la dimension constitucional del debate. Son efectivamente cada vez mas las cortes constitucionales y tribunales supremos que derivan del sistema de derechos fundamentales y/o de los derechos humanos que les vincula (entre los mas frecuentes, los derechos a la salud, el libre desarrollo de la personalidad, la intimidad, la igualdad y la libertad de expresion), limitaciones a la discrecionalidad del legislador y de los poderes publicos a la hora de articular su ingenieria de clasificaciones de sexo/genero. Hay cortes supremas, como las de Nepal (en 2007), Pakistan (en 2009) e India (en 2014), que han reconocido el derecho a un tercer genero, muy en sintonia con la aceptacion de las sexualidades mixtas en la historia religiosa y politica de la region. Hay otros paises mas cercanos a nuestro entorno, como Alemania (en 2017) o Austria (en 2018), en los que se ha reconocido constitucionalmente la necesidad de una opcion de tercer genero en favor de las personas intersexuales, entendidas como personas que presentan caracteristicas sexuales biologicas -genitales, gonadas, cromosomas, hormonas, etc.- que no corresponden de forma inequivoca y univoca a las definiciones de los sexos que ofrece el binario. Hay otras cortes, como la corte constitucional colombiana que, sin cuestionar el binario, avalo en 2015 la necesidad del sistema de la autoadscripcion desde el entendimiento de que las categorias del sexo y el genero son socialmente construidas y de que cualquier forma de control externo (a traves de un examen fisico o psicologico) requiere la evaluacion estereotipada de los rasgos asociados a un genero u a otro y conlleva por ende una innecesaria restriccion a la identidad personal. Por ultimo, hay otros tribunales, como el Tribunal Constitucional belga, que en el verano del 2019 reconocio tanto el derecho al cambio de sexo a traves de la autodeterminacion, como el derecho a un tercer genero abierto a todas las personas, obligando ademas a introducir fluidez en el sistema de clasificacion, es decir, la posibilidad de que las personas hagan mas de un cambio en funcion del genero sentido en su fuero interno a lo largo de su vida.

The alleged abuses happened when Choi belonged to a team run by the local government of Gyeongju city in the southeast.
 Earlier Monday, two of her ex-teammates told reporters they and Choi had been beaten and suffered verbal and other abuses by their team’s coach, a physical therapist and senior teammates. One of them said she and Choi were once forced to eat 200,000 won ($167) worth of bread until dawn as a punishment for gaining weight.
 The two women requested their names not be revealed, citing worries that media publicity would damage their private lives.
 Choi, a junior bronze medalist at the 2015 Triathlon Asian Championships, was first picked in the national team in 2015, while still in high school. Her last major race was in October, when she finished the South Korean championship in 14th place.

The federal procurement ombudsman remains undecided as to whether his office will be formally probing the sole-sourced contract WE Charity received by the feds to administer $900 million in grants to students.
 "I can confirm that our office has received a request, and we are currently assessing whether or not the issues raised in this request fall within the ombudsman's legislative mandate," said Anik Trepanier, director of communications for the Office of the Procurement Ombudsman, in an email to _Postmedia._
 "We will likely need more information regarding the nature and circumstances of the agreements with the WE Charity before we can make a determination."
 The request referenced is a letter that was sent by the Conservatives asking the ombudsman to launch a review of the deal that WE Charity stepped away from last week.
 It's unclear what more information could be needed, though, given how many aspects of the story have been reported on this past week. Although, as Trepanier noted, whether  the office can launch a review is restricted by provisions in their own regulations and the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act.
 What's on the public record has clearly been enough for the ethics commissioner to launch its own investigation into the controversial deal. This would mark the third time something directly involving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been probed by that office.
 Isn't that enough then, the ethics commissioner? Should we care whether this other post even probes it?
 A lot of Canadians have probably never even heard of the procurement ombudsman, a post created in 2006 in the aftermath of the Liberal sponsorship scandal, and currently headed by Alexander Jeglic.
 While the ethics commissioner can at least slap scofflaws on the wrist with a small cash fine -- something former commissioner Mary Dawson said is not enough and must be strengthened -- the ombudsman only issues reports with recommendations.
 What it could also accomplish, though, is drawing attention to one of the most underreported parts of Canadian government -- procurement.
 Every year, public servants sign off on billions of dollars worth of contracts. The dollar values range from in the hundreds to the billions.
 There are of course rules, and the greater the sum, the more rules and oversight. But most of these contracts, regardless of size, receive little if any public and media scrutiny.
 This could be an opportunity to change that. People want details about the WE Charity deal and answers about how it came about.
 The ethics commissioner will tell us whether Trudeau yet again violated federal laws with his involvement in this story. But the commissioner likely won't give us a full A to Z on how this decision was made about our money. That's an exercise better suited for the procurement ombudsman.
 When it comes to complaints, the ones the ombudsman's office usually receives are from suppliers who feel like they didn't get a fair shake. Their other big job is reviewing the broader procurement processes undertaken by departments.
 They're both valid but of minimal interest to the public. Taxpayers need to feel more invested in government procurement. It's their money after all.
 For example, the national shipbuilding strategy to revitalize our naval fleet is a colossal spend -- running in at $70 billion and counting. It's a much- needed project, but not enough disinterested observers are minding that till.
 Let's get to the bottom of the details surrounding the WE Charity contract, and then let's keep the ball rolling.

The show revolves around a different theme each season, pitting competitors in a series of weekly mini-competitions that combine puzzles, and strategy and arguably the most physical competitions in the genre. Castmates are sequestered in a huge, decked out house in an exotic locale that provides the drama MTV shows are known for. Most episodes end with two players going head- to-head in the hopes of qualifying for a days-long final challenge and a large cash prize. The show airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on MTV.
 Although “The Challenge” came first, it hasn’t garnered the same type of critical acclaim, or Emmy love, as some other reality competition shows.
 “I don’t think that it gets its due in the pantheon … of reality television,” said Breanna L. Heldman, a senior editor at People magazine. “Some of that is because ‘Survivor,’ ‘Big Brother’— those are on big networks and they’re getting a lot more viewers.”
 Debuting in 1998, contestants were tapped from MTV’s “Road Rules” which last aired in 2007, before adding casts members from the groundbreaking series “The Real World.” Story lines, and rivalries, have developed over multiple seasons.
 “We’ve gotten to watch them grow and fall in love and fall out of love and make enemies and kiss and make up and make the enemies again,” said Heldman. “’It is a soap opera as much as it is a reality competition series.”
 Recent seasons have expanded the contestant ranks, welcoming competitors from other series, including “Big Brother,” “Survivor,” “American Ninja Warrior” and the UK’s “Geordie Shore” and “Love Island.”

Norwich looked to make an immediate impact on the game and forced Ben Foster into an early save from a Buendia free-kick.
 The visitors then broke the deadlock in the fourth minute. Onel Hernandez found space before playing in Buendia, who cut inside and curled the ball into the far corner.
 Daniel Farke's side could not hold onto their lead for long, however, with Dawson heading home at the far post from an Etienne Capoue free-kick to level the game in the 10th minute.
 Norwich looked to pile on the pressure in the latter part of the first half, playing fluent football and trying to get behind the Watford defence. But they nearly found themselves caught out when Tim Krul had to make a diving stop to deny Welbeck heading the ball into the net form a corner.
 Watford came close to taking the lead just before half-time, but Ismaila Sarr's cross was headed just over the Norwich bar by Abdoulaye Doucoure.
 The start of the second half was similar to the start of the first. The visitors enjoyed longer periods of possession, but did not make a similar breakthrough, although Foster had to stretch out his leg to deny Max Aarons his first goal of the season.
 However the Canaries were caught out by a quick break from the home side, and Sarr's cross was deflected before Welbeck scored his first Premier League goal for the club with a spectacular overhead kick.
 The home side were nearly caught out in the final stages, but Adam Idah directed a flick from Josip Drmic just wide of Foster's goal.

The commentariat, of course, has a gift for finding flaws in any potential candidate. In the case of previous Biden foe Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), it’s a too-tough resume, while she was California attorney general, on issues important to black voters. Similarly, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) missed the opportunity while she was Minnesota’s attorney general to tackle issues of police abuse that might have prevented George Floyd’s death; she has withdrawn her name from the list. Florida Rep. Val Demings, an African American and former Orlando police chief, is relatively inexperienced. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren may suffer the unfortunate capacity to remind Biden of his inferior grasp of complicated issues.
 But two other names, one of them as-yet-unmentioned, stand out – former U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice and, wait for it, former Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. Both women are whip smart, highly trained and experienced in world affairs. Both know Biden well and are highly qualified to assist him on both international and domestic fronts.
 Neither has experience running for high office, but there are more important things. Should the worst come to pass, either woman could skip orientation and start fully equipped to lead. Indeed, Jarrett, a lawyer, businesswoman and Stanford graduate, was basically a shadow president for eight years next to Obama.
 Though Rice also served as Obama’s national security adviser, she’s unfairly freighted with political baggage that Jarrett, working behind the scenes, has escaped. Recall 2012 when Rice, stepping in for then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, reported on five Sunday news shows that attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi were a “spontaneous” reaction to a viral, anti- Muslim video. When subsequent investigations proved otherwise, Rice was unfairly accused of “lying.” I defended Rice at the time and stand by that column.
 Jarrett, meantime, was “in the room,” as she has put it, on nearly every crucial issue during the Obama administration. Having spent time with her socially and in the White House, I can attest to her graciousness, intelligence and absolute discretion. She’s no one’s fool and holds her cards close. While serving the president, she also pursued her own projects, speaking often on the country’s toxic politics, the need for compromise and issues of the day.
 During a recent Axios interview, asked to comment on Biden’s vice-presidential choices, Jarrett said, “I trust him completely to pick the right person.”
 Here’s looking at you, Valerie.

During its space debut last December, the Starliner ended up in the wrong orbit and could not reach the International Space Station.

Many local producers harvested their cereal rye or other winter small grain crops as baleage or haylage. However, some farmers still are looking forward to harvesting those crops for grain and making some much-needed straw as well.  
 Those fields harvested for forage are likely now in corn or soybeans. But, if you are planning on harvesting grain in the next couple weeks or if you have oats coming off soon either as forage or grain, below are a few considerations to follow those crops.  
 Oats as a forage have received a lot of attention in research plots recently. Oats as grain, forage and even straw are highly palatable. An article by Jason Hartschuh and Al Gahler, OSU Extension Educators, discussed the findings of one such study. The current recommendation includes planting 2-3 bu. per acre in early August, applying 50 lbs. of nitrogen per acre, and keeping a close watch on recommendations for a preventative fungicide treatment against rust. Severe presence of rust will negatively impact all aspects of forage quality.  
 Field trials receiving 50 lbs. of nitrogen had an average crude protein test of 14% compared to 10% without added nitrogen. Dry matter yields averaged 1 to 1.5 ton per acre with 3 tons being quite possible under favorable conditions. You may consider purchasing a forage variety of oats as compared to the typical spring sown varieties to maximize yield. Recently, double cropping with oats has been equally or more profitable than double crop soybeans.  
 Summer planted oats are typically cut between the boot and early dough stage, partially dried, and then ensiled as wrapped round bales. Oats also can be effectively grazed and occasionally baled dry. Drying may take up to six days in the fall with multiple tedding and raking passes.  
 Warm season, C-4 grasses, like sorghum, sorghum-sudangrass, and pearl millet are beginning to gain attention in the Midwest as another forage option following winter cereal crops. Ideally, these would be planted the same time as corn, though they can be successfully established through mid-July. Care must be taken in harvesting or grazing these at the recommended height as nitrate and prussic acid poisoning are a concern. Multiple cuts or grazing passes can be made off these. Harvest or graze when the plants reach 15-20 inches in height (18-24 for sorghum-sudangrass). Staggering the planting dates in a grazing situation will improve utilization.  
 Grazing allows a wider selection of plant species to consider for summer forage seedings. Some mixed stands simply do not work well in mechanical harvesting systems. You may want to include brassicas like forage turnips or radishes which are highly digestible, field peas or cow peas which are high in protein and can fix nitrogen in the soil, oats or buckwheat -- quick to germinate and establish while also an excellent scavenger of phosphorous (ideal in areas with excessive and repeated manure application).  
 You may also consider leaving those crops a true cover crop by not harvesting them at all. This strategy also improves weed control. In this case, choose plant species you are prepared to terminate and pair species with similar termination strategies. Brassicas, oats, peas and buckwheat will all winter kill. Clovers, rye, barley and vetch do not winter kill and require an herbicide application or intensive mechanical tillage to terminate. Buckwheat should be terminated at flowering to prevent seed production that may germinate in your cash crops the following year.  
 To help with selecting the forages that best fit your operation, consider getting a copy of the Midwest Cover Crop guide as it provides great details on many species outside of our typical cash crops. The online Midwest Cover Crop Decision Tool is another great resource.  
 Before double cropping or seeding a cover crop, consult your crop insurance agency as some management strategies may affect your eligibility to receive payments on cash crops.  
 In addition to soil health benefits, grant funding through the Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District is another incentive. Applicants must have aerial maps, soil tests within the past four years, and records of applied nutrients (commercial and manure).

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Adam Haseley reported to camp Tuesday after waiting several days for clearance because the lab used by Major League Baseball didn’t return the results of his initial test for the coronavirus. “Once we realized we weren’t going to get that result, we retested him and he tested negative,” Phillies general manager Matt Klentak said Tuesday. “It’s going to be critical that the testing is done reliably and done quickly. The league folks, the Players Association folks, and the folks at the lab are doing the best they can, and we absolutely understand that this is a huge undertaking and it’s the first time that these parties have ever gone through that. So, we understand all that. “Nevertheless, it’s frustrating for a player like Adam Haseley or the Phillies when something like that happens, and our hope throughout the league is that as we work through these instances early, that we will be able to smooth them out for later in camp and later in the season.” Haseley said the issue wasn’t “too big of a deal” now. If a similar error occurred during the 60-game regular season, it could cost a player several games. “I’m not sure what this situation would look like if we’re a couple weeks down the road,” Haseley said. Klentak confirmed bench coach Rob Thomson, bullpen coach Jim Gott, bullpen catcher Greg Brodzinski, infielder Scott Kingery, reliever Tommy Hunter and outfielder Mikie Mahtook tested positive for the coronavirus. Klentak said each is doing well and waiting to complete MLB's protocol before returning to the team.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA has added more safety fixes for Boeing’s space capsule before it can fly astronauts following a pair of close calls during last year’s test flight.
 In closing out the seven-month investigation, NASA officials said Tuesday they have now identified 80 corrective actions, mostly involving software and testing, that must be done before the Starliner capsule launches again. The previous count was 61.
 “It’s a bit of a wake-up call for NASA and its contractors” across the board, said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program.
 During its space debut last December with no one on board, the Starliner ended up in the wrong orbit and could not reach the International Space Station. Ground controllers barely had time to solve another software problem that could have destroyed the capsule at flight’s end.
 Boeing will repeat the flight later this year before attempting to launch astronauts next spring.
 SpaceX, meanwhile, successfully launched two NASA astronauts to the space station in May. They will return home next month aboard their Dragon capsule, splashing down off the Florida coast.

Other businesses that received funds early on have had to furlough or lay off employees a second time as the rise in infections in the United States forces a new round of business closures.
 The share of loan funds that went to low and moderate income areas almost exactly matched that group’s share of the population, according to a Treasury Department analysis. It is unclear, however, whether minority-owned business received a proportionate share of PPP loans. The limited demographic information that was collected for PPP loans was withheld from the data sets released Monday.
 In May, a federal inspector general report concluded that SBA did not direct private lenders to prioritize minority- and female-owned businesses as Congress intended under the program. SBA Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware found that the SBA failed to incorporate guidance on lending to businesses in underserved communities although he concluded what the SBA has “mostly” been aligned with the legislation.
 Ideas from congressional leaders led by Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) include directing more money to businesses that prove they were affected by the pandemic and better targeting businesses with fewer than 10 employees. Hotel or restaurant chains may also be legally prevented from receiving more than $2 million total.

The rate of new confirmed coronavirus cases in Kansas is on the rise and doesn't appear to be slowing.
   
 In a news conference Monday afternoon at the Kansas Statehouse, Gov. Laura Kelly addressed that increase in cases, urged Kansans to wear face coverings in public settings and recommended that counties not advance past Phase 3 of her "Ad Astra: A Plan to Reopen Kansas."
   
 "The nearly 3,500 new cases in the past two weeks is the steepest rate of increase we have seen since the pandemic began," Kelly said.
   
 The Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported 16,901 confirmed COVID-19 cases on Monday -- an increase of nearly 1,000 cases since Friday, Kelly said.
   
 Since Wednesday, she added, KDHE has seen an increase of 14 cluster sites across the state. Kansas has had a total of 235 clusters of coronavirus cases, 118 of which are still active. Kelly said seven active clusters are directly related to gatherings at bars and restaurants.
   
 She said no clusters have been associated with barber shops, nail salons or other direct-contact personal services, and she attributes the lack of clusters in those settings to the use of face masks.
   
 "That is not a coincidence," Kelly said. "It is more proof that masks and hygienic business practices do indeed work."
   
 According to Kelly, the mask mandate she issued last week isn't about politics or state or local control
   
 "If we continue to ignore the experts," she said, "there is no question Kansas will end up like other states that have not taken this threat seriously."
   
 She pointed to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott who resisted making masks mandatory and at one point banned local municipalities from requiring masks. Last week, Abbott reversed that decision, amid a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases in the state. He made masks mandatory in Texas counties with more than 20 confirmed cases and tightened restrictions that had previously been loosened.
   
 "I can't stress the point enough. This is not about state and local control, and it's not a question of personal freedom," Kelly said. "This is a matter of social responsibility while we're dealing with the worst outbreak of communicable virus in a century."
   
 Though the executive order Kelly signed last week requires the use of masks in all public spaces where social distancing isn't possible, it is up to local officials to decide whether to adopt and enforce the order. Many Kansas counties are choosing not to require masks or plan to adopt less restrictive mask measures. Kelly said that's not the way to go.
   
 "I know there's been a lot of conflicting information out there," Kelly said. "I also know certain elected officials and other influential voices would rather bury their heads in the sand and keep ignoring this very real threat."
   
 According to KDHE numbers, 280 Kansans have died from COVID-19.
   
 Kelly said it is her responsibility to protect residents of the state regardless of political consequences. That, she said, is why she chose to require masks.
   
 "Public health experts in my administration and beyond continue to tell me we can save lives by wearing masks," Kelly said.

Aavin plans to revamp the consumer card system through which seven lakh litres of milk are being supplied in the city daily. It is now looking at an online and a mobile app-based renewal system.
 At present, Aavin sells consumer cards between the 1st and 15th of every month and the card is used for a month. Like bus passes, the Aavin card too is punched daily by persons manning milk booths. There are a total of 900-odd milk delivery points across the city.
 "The idea is to do away with the physical card so that consumers need not have to go to booths or zonal offices for renewal. Since everyone has a smart phone these days, online renewals would be more convenient," said a senior official of Aavin. "We are planning to let consumers buy milk for any number of days. If they don't want milk for a certain number of days too, the system will allow them to do so," he added.

Borrowing from the program has slowed to a trickle despite Congress and officials at the Treasury Department and the SBA repeatedly loosening the rules to allow more companies to receive funds and making it easier for borrowers to have the loans forgiven and turned into grants, as most are.
 Congress passed legislation this week extending the deadline to apply to through Aug. 8 and are considering how best to repurpose money that is left over. About $130 billion remains in the program, and the administration plans to release more data about the program after that deadline.
 Questions about when and how data would be released have dogged the program almost since its launch. The SBA has released the names of borrowers and the amount of their loans dating to 1991 for most recipients of the agency’s 7(a) loan program, on which PPP was fashioned. The agency also informed borrowers on the PPP application form that the names of borrowers would be “automatically released” to the public.
 After a series of contradictory statements by officials about what would be released, SBA withheld the names of borrowers for loans of $150,000 or less, which likely omits most sole proprietors and independent contractors.

Well there are many acts that feel music is an outlet that can be used to break the ice and help express wants, needs and the cry of others. Jamaica is filled with great singers and acts across all 14 parishes. Well we present one more. He has had extensive training via the church and signing in his local arena and community and has finally realized that his passion is singing and the world should be a part of his journey.

About 70 percent coastal fishermen have become unemployed due the ongoing 65-day ban on fishing in the Bay of Bengal.   More than 50 percent fishermen can't afford to buy food for three times a day while 45 percent of them borrowed money at high interest rate to keep body and soul together.   A recent study report of the COAST Trust, a coast based non-governmental organization working on capacity building among the coastal poor, revealed the information on Tuesday, according to a release of the NGO.   It said the COAST had prepared the report based on information from 264 fishermen families in the coastal districts of Cox's Bazar, Laksmipur, Bhola, Patuakhali, Khulna and Bagerhat.   According to the report, around 42.4 percent of them had an average monthly income of Tk6, 000 to 10,000 during normal period while income of 34.6 percent was in between Tk11, 000 to Tk16,000 and 17 percent was above Tk16,000.   But, 60.8pc families have had no income at all during this ban period. As a result, They are passing through a very hard time.   Although the government provided 43 kg of rice support for each of the family of fishermen only 65.8 percent families got it while the rest 34.2 percent have not yet received any assistance.   Forty percent fishermen complained that their names were enlisted but they got nothing.   According to the report, 67.5 percent families claimed that the rice provided by the government was inadequate as there was no cash support for them to meet other household expenses.   The study also found that violence against women in the families of fishermen increased during the ban on fishing. Around 51.8pc women of fishermen families have experienced domestic violence during the period.   The study also finds that 95.4pc fishermen have no alternative source of income except fishing at sea.

For the entire season, the WNBA says players will don warmup shirts with "Black Lives Matter" on the front and "Say Her Name" on the back. "Black Lives Matter" will also be displayed on the court during games.
 "We are incredibly proud of WNBA players who continue to lead with their inspiring voices and effective actions in the league's dedicated fight against systemic racism and violence," WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in a statement.
 Nneka Ogwumike, the president of the league's players' association and a forward for the Los Angeles Sparks, called the effort "a pivotal moment" in modern sports history.
 "With 140-plus voices all together for the first time ever, we can be a powerful force connecting to our sisters across the country and in other parts of the world," Ogwumike said.
 The WNBA also announced the formation of the WNBA/WNBPA Social Justice Council, which plans to hold a series of conversations centered around race, LGBTQ+ advocacy, gun control and voting rights.
 Las Vegas Aces forward Angel McCoughtry tweeted, "We have yet to scratch the surface into making a better America !"

Johnson’s Downing Street office also urged China not to interfere if Hong Kong residents who are eligible to reside and seek citizenship in the U.K. want to come and said the government was “also reviewing extradition arrangements with Hong Kong.’'
 The conflict over Britain’s response to developments in Hong Kong has soured relations with China, the world’s second-largest economy, at a time when Johnson’s government wants new trading relationships following the U.K.'s exit from the European Union.
 The national security law China imposed last week makes secessionist, subversive, or terrorist activities illegal, as well as foreign intervention in the city’s internal affairs. Activities such as shouting slogans or holding up banners and flags calling for the city’s independence are violations of the law regardless of whether violence is used.
 China argues the measure was needed to quell lawlessness and rioting. But there are signs the law is chilling free speech in Hong Kong after the city’s public libraries pulled books written by pro-democracy figures from shelves. Authorities said the books were being reviewed in light of the new legislation.

So I decided to try my luck again this morning. Rain was forecast again, so I watched the sky carefully. I again got to trailhead a little before 6. An almost full moon was shining through the clouds, and it was beautiful. I could hear Painted Bunting’s song, but it was too dark to see them. I looked up and saw some White Ibis flying over. For the last week, I’ve watched a group of six or seven fly over at about the same time every morning. There were flashes of lightning in the thunderheads in the distance, so I didn’t linger. I made my way to the bridge over the Trinity. There is a low spot on the trail that often holds water, but there’s a clear path to the right where you can walk on dry ground, which I did. It wasn’t raining and the clouds didn’t look like rain was imminent, so I sat and read a Psalm and wrote in my journal. Then I started walking back.

After receiving a scholarship offer from the Hawkeyes a couple weeks ago, four-star tight end Gunnar Helm stopped by Iowa City to tour the campus on Monday. Since it is currently an NCAA dead period for recruiting, the 6-foot-5, 225-pound Colorado native was not able to meet with the coaches, but did his best to get a good look at everything on his own.
 "I mean I really just took it into my own hands to get out there and just get a feel for the campus and what it’s like to be there in person," said Helm. "I really just walked and drove around the campus and then planned a virtual with the coaching staff in the near future to get the in-depth picture of the facilities."
 Helm, whose grandfather Roger Helm played for the Hawkeyes during the Forest Evashevski era in the 1950's, was impressed by what he saw in Iowa City on Monday.
 "I was in awe of how big and brand new the campus and stadium looked," Helm said. "It was crazy to me how everything looked in such great shape."
 Over the past week, Helm has been able to take similar visits to Ohio State, Wisconsin, and Nebraska, and says that he is hoping to get down to Texas next if possible. While it is not the same as an official visit, the trips have helped the four-star prospect start thinking about when he would like to make a decision, possibly by the end of summer.
 "Seeing all of these schools is definitely speeding up my process," said Helm.
 In early May, Helm narrowed his long list of offers down to a top 14, which included Alabama, Arizona State, Auburn, Colorado, Georgia, LSU, Oklahoma State, Penn State, TCU, Tennessee, UCLA, Washington, and Wisconsin. Since then, Iowa and Texas have offered and joined the group as well.

The owners of beaches that require a fee place lounge chairs at required intervals, but on the city’s public beaches few visitors appeared concerned with trying to avoid COVID-19 by maintaining a safe distance.
 Hotel owners are happy about the bonanza, and prices for rooms are soaring.
 “Our hotel is booked to the max, and the projections are very optimistic, because preliminary bookings indicate the load will remain very good up to November,” said David Vardanyan, a Sochi hotel owner.
 In the past, many Russians who live in the eastern part of a country that spans 11 time zones took vacations in Thailand, China or Vietnam to save money on air travel. Those destinations remain off-limits to foreigners, too, for now, helping swell the numbers of people streaming westward to Sochi and the Crimean Peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Anchoring overnight on the river channel is not recommended, as any spot on the river that will allow for enough room for the boat to swing on the line will probably put it in the way of a tow. If you do anchor, even for a short time, do so in an area you think is out of the channel. If a Towboat Captain turns on his or her searchlight and keeps it shining on your boat, you have anchored in a position where you should not be. It is mandatory to move out of the way as fast as possible.

It means Leicester’s place among the leading pack looks that bit more secure and they will not mind overly that, despite intensive efforts to twist the knife late on, they are yet to win this particular fixture since 1973.
