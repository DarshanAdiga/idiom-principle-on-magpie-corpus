Now, it‚Äôs all about the timing.
 The track worlds are scheduled for Aug. 6-15, which obviously won‚Äôt work if the Tokyo Olympics are pushed back a full year to roughly the same spot on the calendar as this year‚Äôs games ‚Äî July 24-Aug. 9.
 If the Olympics are held in April or May, an idea that seems to be under serious consideration, the track worlds could press forward with their plans.
 Even so, Doyle said it would be better to delay the world championships to 2022.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think putting them in the same year makes a lot of sense, especially when really 2022, it should be relatively easy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know all the intricacies of the city of Eugene. I would imagine that having a little more time might be good.‚Äù

Setting boundaries with parents can stir up feelings of doubt, fear, and guilt. In order for us to be able to practice assertive communication and compassion toward ourselves, we have to practice recognizing feelings of guilt around setting boundaries. Guilt can be an indicator that we feel like we are doing something wrong, and it's important to fully know that setting boundaries with your parents is not wrong. It is just is. Boundaries are an important part in preserving the relationship and building your sense of self.
 A practice in releasing guilt can be reciting affirmations like "I deserve to express myself" and "I am allowed to have my needs met."
 At the end of the day, you get to decide your boundaries and your terms. Remind yourself of why you are setting your boundaries, and practice self- validation and self-compassion before, during, and after the conversation with your parents.

 3\. Brady keeps
 expectations in check
 One of the first questions posed to Brady by members of the Tampa Bay media was ‚Äòwhat can you do to help change things for the Buccaneers?‚Äô
 Tampa Bay hasn‚Äôt made the playoffs since 2007, and the hope around the franchise is that Brady can help establish a winning culture and lead the Bucs back to contention.
 Brady made no attempt to portray himself as a savior, however, repeatedly emphasizing that his job is to get up to speed with the offense and hopefully do his part in helping the team succeed.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to make a bunch of predictions,‚Äù Brady said. ‚ÄúI go in looking forward to learning from the new coaches and new players and I‚Äôm going to give it everything I‚Äôve got.‚Äù
 4\. Excited to work
 with Arians, Leftwich
 When asked about the prospect of playing in head coach Bruce Arians‚Äô offense, Brady said he‚Äôs watched a lot of film on his teams over the years, and has always been impressed by their level of production.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great offense for the quarterbacks, for the receivers, the running backs. There have been a lot of great players who have worked with coach Arians, and it‚Äôs for me to come in and learn the things we need to do to be successful and what we collectively do well,‚Äù Brady said. ‚ÄúGreat offenses aren‚Äôt about one player; they‚Äôre about every guy being on the same page.‚Äù
 Brady was also asked about offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich, a former peer of Brady‚Äôs who played quarterback in the NFL for four teams between 2003 and 2012.
 ‚ÄúWe had a chance to talk a couple of times and I‚Äôm looking forward to getting to know him,‚Äù Brady said. ‚ÄúI watched him play for a long time, competed against him, and he‚Äôs done an incredible job transitioning into his second career.‚Äù

Tom Brady is officially a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. That sentence being factual is going to take some getting used to, but the reality of Brady on the Buccaneers hit home on Tuesday as the future Hall of Famer was officially introduced by the team on a conference call with the Tampa Bay media.
 What did he have to say? Here are four things we learned as Brady spoke as a member of the Buccaneers for the first time.
 1\. Brady looking ahead
 The big question on everyone from New England‚Äôs mind remains ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù Why did Brady leave New England? What could the Patriots have done to keep him?
 Brady was asked those very questions on the call but declined to shed any light on what made him decide the time was right to leave.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about the past because that‚Äôs not relevant to my future,‚Äù Brady said, adding that it has been an emotional transition for him.
 Rather than take subtle shots or passive aggressive snipes at his former team out the door, Brady was effusive in his praise for the Patriots organization throughout the call.
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nobody who‚Äôs been a bigger fan of the Patriots than me; I have nothing but respect and love,‚Äù Brady said. ‚ÄúI have so many great relationships that will be maintained, and the greatest gift football has brought me is the incredible relationships I‚Äôve had with people I‚Äôve worked with.‚Äù
 2\. When did he
 decide to leave?
 During the call Brady was asked when he knew for sure that his time with the Patriots was over. The quarterback said it didn‚Äôt become real until the night he met with Robert Kraft and spoke with him in person.
 ‚ÄúI asked if I could come over and see him, and we spoke and had a great conversation,‚Äù Brady said, adding that he wanted to express to Kraft what he‚Äôs meant to him in his life.
 Brady went on to say that he also spoke with Bill Belichick and Jonathan Kraft that night as well, and that he harbors no ill will towards the franchise.

He has not found a product that provides this out of the box: ‚ÄúTraditional analytics methods, especially using funnels and things like that, don‚Äôt really work for us because we don‚Äôt have such clear end-goals for people,‚Äù he says.
