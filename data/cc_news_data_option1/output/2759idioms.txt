Stability is perhaps one of the biggest benefits to online schooling in light of the coronavirus.

As the only one of our artists with a JV deal with a major, Lecrae, two-time Grammy award winning artist and co-owner of Reach Records, still valued that flexibility and control as much today with gold and platinum records on the walls as he did back in 2003 selling CDs out of the trunk of a Dodge Stratus. That’s why Reach did everything in our power to get the rights _back_ into independent hands for his upcoming album _Restoration_. And it worked. So last Saturday, when it no longer feels right to put out an upbeat record about being “over the top” on Friday, we’re able to swap it out for a single that directly addresses the current civil rights movement and personal experiences Lecrae has had, “Deep End.” In fact, we swapped the record and decided to put it out earlier, on Wednesday, _just four days later_. And we’re able to do all of that without sacrificing commercial terms.

NEW YORK (AP) — The dance has ended for “Dancing With the Stars” hosts Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews. ABC said in a statement that the show is looking to “embark on a new creative direction” and host Bergeron “departs the show with our sincerest thanks and gratitude for his trademark wit and charm that helped make this show a success.” No replacements were named. Bergeron has hosted “Dancing With the Stars” since its premiere in 2005. He took to Twitter to announce his departure. “It’s been an incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career,” he wrote. “I’m grateful for that and for the lifelong friendships made.” Last year, Bergeron made waves when he expressed his unhappiness that former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was among the contestants for the fall season. Bergeron tweeted that he earlier told producers he hoped the new season would be a “joyful respite from our exhausting political climate” and urged them not have any “divisive bookings.” Producers apparently disagreed. “We can agree to disagree, as we do now, but ultimately it’s their call,” Bergeron wrote. The finale that season — No. 28 — ended with Hannah Brown and Alan Bersten taking the trophy but scored a new low in total viewers among the show’s previous finales. Still, the show was the most watched program on broadcast television with 7.7 million total viewers. The network on Monday also said farewell to Andrews, who originally competed as a contestant back in 2010 and returned as co-host in 2014. \"Her signature sense of humor has become a hallmark of the show,” the statement read.

 Mientras los casos del virus en Estados Unidos seguían subiendo y crecía la cifra de muertos, la Casa Blanca trabajaba para desautorizar a su experto en coronavirus que más confianza despertaba, minimizando los riesgos mientras el presidente, Donald Trump, presionaba para reactivar la economía antes de enfrentar a los votantes en noviembre.
 El caso de Estados Unidos, donde los contagios remitieron para luego multiplicarse, se ha convertido en una advertencia para otros países. Sin embargo, Trump insinúa que la gravedad de la pandemia, que ha matado a más de 135.000 estadounidenses, está siendo exagerada por los críticos para socavar sus opciones de reelección.
 Trump retuiteó el lunes un post de Chuck Woolery, que fue presentador del programa de televisión “Love Connection”, afirmando que “todo el mundo miente” sobre el COVID-19. El tuit de Woolery atacaba no sólo a los medios y los demócratas, sino también a los Centros de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades y la mayoría de los médicos “en los que nos dicen que confiemos. Creo que todo gira en torno a las elecciones y en impedir que la economía se recupere, lo que gira en torno a las elecciones”.
 Al mismo tiempo, el presidente y altos cargos de la Casa Blanca redoblaban sus ataques contra el doctor Anthony Fauci, el máximo experto del país en enfermedades infecciosas. Fauci se ha visto cada vez más relegado por la Casa Blanca conforme advertía sobre el virus, un mensaje muy mal recibido en un momento en el que Trump se centra en presionar para reabrir la economía.
 “Ni siquiera hemos empezado a ver el final', dijo el lunes en una charla con el decano de la Facultad de Medicina de Stanford, en la que pidió un “paso atrás” en las reaperturas.
 La semana pasada, Fauci contradijo a Trump sobre la gravedad del virus en el podcast FiveThirtyEight. Aunque Trump repite que ha hecho un gran trabajo contra la pandemia, Fauci dijo que “Como país, cuando nos comparas con otros países, no creo que puedas decir que nos va genial. Quiero decir, simplemente no es así”.
 Trump dijo más tarde que Fauci había “cometido muchos errores”. Mencionó que el experto había discrepado en un principio con su decisión de prohibir la llegada de viajeros desde China y los cambios en las recomendaciones sobre el uso de mascarillas conforme los científicos iban aprendiendo más sobre el virus. La Casa Banca detalló esas recomendaciones en comunicados a los medios durante el fin de semana.
 Cuando se le preguntó si el presidente seguía teniendo confianza en Fauci, un funcionario de la Casa Blanca insistió el lunes en que sí. El funcionario dijo que Fauci, director del Instituto Nacional de Alergia y Enfermedades Infecciosas, estaba considerado como “una voz valorada' en el equipo de trabajo contra el coronavirus de la Casa Blanca. El funcionario habló bajo condición de anonimato, a pesar de que el presidente ha criticado en repetidas ocasiones el empleo de fuentes anónimas.
 “Tengo una relación muy buena con el doctor Fauci”, dijo Trump a la prensa el lunes, describiéndole como “una persona muy agradable”, aunque añadió que “no siempre estoy de acuerdo con él”.
 Peter Navarro, un importante asesor de comercio de la Casa Blanca que ha trabajado en los esfuerzos contra el coronavirus, no repitió ese mensaje de apoyo.
 En un email a The Associated Press el lunes, Navarro criticó a Fauci, afirmando que tiene “buena comunicación con la población, pero se ha equivocado en todo lo que he tratado con él”. Eso incluía, señaló, minimizar el riesgo inicial del virus y expresar su escepticismo sobre el uso de la hidroxicloroquina, que Navarro ha defendido con vehemencia pese a las informaciones contradictorias sobre su eficacia y seguridad.
 Fauci, que no ha participado en las últimas conferencias de prensa de la Casa Blanca y apenas ha hecho apariciones en televisión, dijo la semana pasada al Financial Times que no había visto a Trump en persona desde el 2 de junio y no le había reportado directamente en al menos dos meses.
 El doctor atribuyó el hecho de que el gobierno rechazara muchas de sus peticiones de aparecer en medios a que se había negado a seguir la línea marcada por la Casa Blanca.
 “Tengo una reputación, como probablemente ha notado, de decir la verdad en todo momento y no endulzar las cosas. Y ese podría ser uno de los motivos por los que no he salido mucho en televisión últimamente”, dijo Fauci.
 Los rivales políticos de Trump lo plantearon en términos más firmes.
 “El despreciable intento del presidente de cargar el muerto a otro culpando al máximo experto del país en enfermedades infecciosas -cuyos consejos ha ignorado reiteradamente y que Joe Biden le ha suplicado constantemente que siga- es otra espantosa y reveladora falta de liderazgo mientras la cifra de muertos sigue creciendo innecesariamente', dijo Andrew Bates, portavoz de la campaña presidencial del demócrata Biden.
 El presidente ha considerado como una afrenta personal el hecho de que Fauci le contradiga en público, haciendo que algunos en el Ala Oeste miren con malos ojos al doctor, según fuentes. Algunos dijeron que, si bien Fauci es crítico con el presidente en entrevistas en medios, a puerta cerrada es en gran parte respetuoso con el mandatario. Y se quejan de que personas ajenas al gobierno, incluidos algunos en los medios, han destacado la figura de Fauci a expensas de otros cargos públicos.
 Fauci no respondió a una petición de comentarios el lunes.
 Esos elogios a Fauci no son nada bienvenidos en un momento en el que la Casa Blanca intenta que sus expertos en salud den un paso atrás para mantener la conversación previa a las elecciones en la recuperación económica, y no en la persistencia de la pandemia.
 En los primeros días del virus, cuando Trump se molestó por la atención que recibía Fauci, la Casa Blanca tomó el control de la agenda de medios del doctor, reduciendo de forma drástica sus apariciones en televisión, aunque él siguió encontrando medios alternativos, como podcasts y medios sociales.
 El equipo del presidente ha dejado claro que no tiene intención de intentar destituir a Fauci, sabiendo el escándalo que provocaría. En cambio, parecen satisfechos con reducir su presencia mediática e instar a legisladores republicanos, miembros del gobierno y otros aliados a destacar algunos de los errores iniciales de Fauci.
 La iniciativa forma parte de los esfuerzos de la Casa Blanca de “contraatacar” en nombre de Trump, que cree que todos los deslices deben tener una respuesta contundente, según un funcionario que, como otros, habló bajo condición de anonimato para comentar deliberaciones en la Casa Blanca.
 Al mismo tiempo están apareciendo aliados en defensa de Fauci. El presidente y el director científico de la Asociación Estadounidense de Facultades de Medicina emitieron un comunicado indicando que la entidad estaba “extremadamente preocupada y alarmada por los esfuerzos” para desacreditar a Fauci.
 “No podemos permitir que Donald Trump silencie al doctor Fauci ni a ningún otro científico del gobierno”, dijo el senador Ed Markey, demócrata de Massachusetts, que en abril propuso una legislación para proteger a Fauci y a otros líderes de los institutos nacionales de salud ante despidos por motivos políticos. “El doctor Fauci salva vidas todos los días”.

JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — A Colorado company agreed to a $7 million cleanup plan for Alaska’s only uranium mine, which has left radioactive waste in the Tongass National Forest. Newmont Corporation is expected to fill the former Ross-Adams Mine in the Prince of Wales Island area, CoastAlaska reported Monday. A plan has been in the works for decades to close and clean the open pit mine area on the slopes of Bokan Mountain at the head of Kendrick Bay. The remote area is used by residents for fishing halibut and other activities, said Eric Rhodes of the Organized Village of Kasaan, who oversees the tribe's efforts to reduce pollution. “It is a highly used area and precious and protected for a reason,” Rhodes said. The federal government commissioned aerial surveys in the 1950s to find uranium deposits throughout Alaska to fuel the nation’s atomic reactors and build nuclear weapons. The open pit mine was developed in 1957 and changed hands several times before closing permanently in 1971. Some of the old equipment and structures need to be dismantled and transported off the island, said Linda Riddle of the U.S. Forest Service. Most of the radioactive debris will be buried and covered with a geo-membrane, a heavy plastic covering to seal the site. The deal reached by Newmont, one of the world’s largest mining companies, and the forest service in the past year calls for the estimated $7 million cleanup to fulfill the company’s final responsibilities at the site. Newmont also agreed to monitor the site for three years after the cleanup effort is complete. The deal waives more than $530,000 in costs the forest service said the agency incurred reaching the deal. The state of Alaska identified the mine as a contaminated site more than 20 years ago, but interest in...

With credit for time served in a juvenile detention center, Alex Lingor was given 65 days in jail after pleading guilty to second-degree manslaughter, aggravated assault and distribution of marijuana to a minor following the 2017 death of 15-year-old Kareem Cisse. The teen was killed when he crashed into a tree while Lingor was chasing him for stealing some marijuana. In a letter to the commission, Lingor said he's is in the process of purchasing a home in Sioux Falls with a friend and is unable to move forward with the transaction because of the lien the county is holding against him, the Argus Leader reported.

We actually see improvements in some areas when using DLSS rather than TAA or FXAA in Death Stranding.

Our friendship went in waves as life happens and we grow, so I will not look back and regret but know I love you and promise to help the legacy of your talent, humor, light and loyalty live on. You are so loved. You deserved the world and we will make sure Josey and your family feel that everyday. I miss you already." -- via Instagram

It's the guitar, the groove in "New Speedway Boogie" that hooked me. The lyrics could have been about anything, I still would have liked it, but they were about Altamont, back before the flawed festival was truly seen as the bummer Woodstock, before most people even knew what happened there, after all the Rolling Stones were still making the transition from singles band to album-makers, and despite the quality of "Let it Bleed," it wasn't until '71 and "Sticky Fingers" that they became the World's Greatest Rock & Roll Band, one which you could not get a ticket to see. But people knew who Mick Jagger was, and when they saw him staring at the concert footage in "Gimme Shelter," horrified, contemplating his culpability, the band was seen as dark, the anti- Beatles, and their festival a complete misreading of American culture, never mind the Hell's Angels. And everybody who participated in this debacle wanted to forget it, and not talk about it, but the Dead wrote a song about it.

THE CONVERSATION) The fate of society rests in part on how humans navigate their complicated relationship with insects - trying to save "good" insects and control "bad" ones. Some insects, like mosquitoes, bite people and make them sick - remember Zika? Now the U.S. mosquito season is already in full swing, with over 10 cases of Dengue fever reported in the Florida Keys this year. Some insects, like bees, are pollinators that help produce our food. Others, like locusts, currently threaten cropsin East Africa and Asia, preferring to eat our food instead.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Seahawks tight end Greg Olsen told The Associated Press he has agreed to a contract with Fox Sports to become its No. 2 NFL game analyst once he retires from football. Olsen signed a one-year, $6.9 million contract with the Seahawks earlier this offseason after spending nine seasons with the Panthers. The New York Post was the first to report the news. The 35-year-old Olsen will partner with Kevin Burkhardt in the booth once the 13-year NFL veteran decides to call it quits.

A website seems like such a dated concept, yet it’s the only place online that you can totally control. Social platforms make you conform to content, format, look and feel restrictions that are always varying, which will never happen on your own site. When all else fails, it’s the one place online where your fans and followers can find the information that want about you without fail (barring downtime for some reason, of course).

Not that this was the Dead's fault. I find a similar situation with Springsteen. I have no problem with the man, certainly none with his output up to around 1990, it's his fans I hate. Music has always been about testing limits, pushing the envelope, it's easy to climb on board after something has been established, but can you take a chance, embrace something before everybody else does, not only in music but in other venues? Most cannot.
