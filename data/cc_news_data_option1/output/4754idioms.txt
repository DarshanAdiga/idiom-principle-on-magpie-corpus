Social media is a powerful force. Instagram is a place that many of us visit every single day, for hours at a time, and the sort of content you consume can have a real impact on how you feel about yourself - and your body. For one plus-size influencer, Danielle Catton, who uses the handle @DanielleIsAnxious, the lack of representation of diverse body types began to have an affect on her mental health. So she chose to do something about it.


  I dial in for a Zoom call with Danielle, who is based in Canada (a few hours outside of Toronto) to hear more about why she decided to create a viral series of posts. In them, she recreates videos (think: 'how to pose yourself thinner' tutorials) and photos that she found excluded her bigger body. One photo, shared by a slim woman, says 'sizing up is not a bad thing' in relation to wearing shorts - an important message about labels not determining self- worth, but in Danielle's version, she writes 'sizing up is not always an option', highlighting that plus-size women often have limited clothing options.


  Danielle first set up her Instagram account around two and a half years ago to document her mental health journey (she has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression), but found as time progressed her focus migrated to fat positivity ("we need to stop weaponising that word") and self-love. For her, mental health and body image go hand in hand - as does representation. "I realised through counselling that a lot of my issues with anxiety came from having poor body image. There was that yearning to love myself and not having self- confidence... I always think what would've helped my teenage self and better representation of body types is one thing, definitely."

In an interview with a police detective, recorded hours after his arrest and shown in court, the defendant said he had hated women ever since he’d “attempted to socialized with some girls” at a Halloween party five years earlier, and “they laughed at me and held the arms of the ugly guys instead.”


  Afterward, he said, he had became radicalized on online incel chat groups. He had made a plan a month before the Toronto attack, thinking “I would inspire future masses to join me in my uprising as well.”


  At no point during the four-hour interview did he display emotion. He spoke plainly about using the 10-foot-van “as a weapon” and hitting people who “are no longer alive as a result.” Near the end he said, “I feel like I accomplished my mission.”


  At the heart of the trial is autism spectrum disorder, which Minassian was diagnosed with at age 5. At a court hearing, his father, Vahe, described how he could be hyper-focused on things like math that interested him, but found social interactions, particularly with women, difficult.


  He called his son “gentle” and “happy” with no history of violence.


  Since the day of the attack, Vahe Minassian told the court while weeping, he and his wife had been asking themselves “what possible signs could there have been that we could have possibly missed?” He added, “To this day, we have no answer.”


  Not criminally responsible findings are uncommon in Canada; the vast majority relate to episodes of psychotic spectrum disorder or mood disorders. Experts in mental disorder law are watching the trial closely and consider the defense “unusual if not unprecedented,” said Anita Szigeti, a criminal lawyer in Toronto.


  “Autism is not normally linked to the inability to know right from wrong,” she said. “Everyone thinks it’s an uphill battle.”


  Organizations representing Canadians with autism denounced the legal argument as dangerous and false.


  Riddell said it would take a lot to convince her Alek Minassian’s condition made him not criminally responsible. Every day since the trial began, she has arrived to the courthouse with her walker to watch the proceedings on a screen, in order simply to not be alone.


  A former Paralympian who won two silver medals for cross-country skiing at the World Disabled Ski Championship in 1986, Riddell spent two months in the hospital after the attack, followed by two years of physical therapy and counseling.


  She is disappointed to not get a chance to confront Minassian, face-to-face. “I want him to see me as a real person,” she said. “I want him to understand all of us as real people with real lives and we suffered immensely.”


  Others, though, have found unexpected comfort from the trial’s virtual aspect.


  Tiffany Jefkins was having lunch on the grass of the public square across the street from her condominium building, when the van barreled past. A first aid instructor, Jefkins rushed to three victims, performing CPR and coaching other bystanders to follow suit.

ADRIAN -- With the major scoring threat from the past few years gone entering the 2020 Lenawee Christian boys soccer team's season, a group was going to be needed to pick up the scoring slack.
   
 Someone was going to be the leader of that group, and senior Brennan Griffith was the leading player who stepped up for the Cougars.
   
 Griffith finished the regular season as the county's leading goal-scorer, then added an average of better than a goal-a-game to that total as Lenawee Christian made its state title run, including the insurance goal in LCS' 2-0 Division 4 state semifinal win over Clarkston Everest Collegiate, an effort that put Griffith up as being one of two Cougars to make the Michigan High School Soccer Coaches Association's Division 4 All-State first team along with keeper Evan Hendershot.
   
 All of that came with Griffith also taking classes toward his second college degree before graduation from high school. For his efforts on the pitch this season, Griffith has deservedly been named the 2020 Lenawee County Boys Soccer Player of the Year, as selected by The Daily Telegram's sports staff.
   
 "It's a crazy honor, I'm kinda shocked because it could've gone to any of my teammates," Griffith said. "They're all really good and I contribute most of my success to them and to my coaches along the way. Glory to God, but yeah, it's a crazy honor."
   
 In previous years, Griffith and the other major scoring threats for LCS that emerged this season, such as Scott Knoll, Gabe Henley and Francisco Cabrera, had been overshadowed by having the Riordan brothers, John and Zach, as the primary scoring options for Lenawee Christian.
   
 But with both of them graduated with Zach's graduation after 2019, Griffith was given clearance to shoot early and often by the Cougar coaching staff, and that, coupled with his teammates' support, gave him the freedom to loose shots at will.
   
 "My teammates were always there to be an encouragement to lift me back up even when I missed completely wide or something like that," Griffith said. "I knew that the next shot, I could just start over with a clean sheet because my teammates had that mindset and had that encouragement with them, and I think that that was what was really special about this year was just the team chemistry and the atmosphere in the team was completely different from past years, and that attributed to a lot of our success."
   
 Griffith finished with 25 goals and 14 assists in his senior campaign for a total of 64 points, scoring four goals in a 7-1 rout of New Boston Huron on Sept. 18, but perhaps his biggest one of the season came in the penultimate game of the year, the 2-0 victory over Everest Collegiate in the semifinals.
   
 While Knoll's tally 90 seconds in ultimately was the difference, the Mountaineers were pressing to try and force an overtime frame, but when Henley drew a foul in the box 25 minutes from the finish, it was Griffith who stepped forward and delivered the dagger blow to Everest's comeback hopes with the penalty kick goal, as the Mountaineer momentum was stopped dead with that tally.
   
 Even so, Griffith was a very selfless player on a team that, to its core, pushed the team-first mentality above individual accolades.
   
 "(Brennan) would talk to you about other players that pushed him, the work that Jacob McKelvey and Franny (Cabrera) do in the middle, what Isaac (Durbin) does at the back and what Gabe (Henley) did up top. He would talk about those other players and what they did to create openings for him. His humility is one of the really amazing things about him," said Lenawee Christian coach Nate Sharpe said, "but to talk about him and his ability, we talked at the beginning of the year that 'Brennan can't defer to other people, he's gotta step in and he's gotta take it' and we gave him the green light very early on to shoot it. He's got a cannon and can shoot from quite a distance and can place the ball where it needs to be.
   
 "For this year, I think the mental fortitude to say 'I'm going to step into this new role, I'm gonna put the team on my shoulders', that was something that pushed him. To see him do that in many games was a fun thing to see as a coach."
   
 Griffith, who is looking to complete his Bachelor's of Business Administration in college, is looking at several schools including Siena Heights University and although he had successes in his senior year, feels that he is done with his soccer career.

You might also consider asking, or even insisting, that the customer pay for the material and colorant up front. This is a common request when the materials are specific to that customer and there is concern about getting stuck with a lot of useless inventory if the program does not live up to the expectations of someone in their Marketing department. Everyone thinks their product will sell like hot cakes!  The reality is--most don't. It's also beneficial to ask the customer to pay for these materials when there are minimum order quantities that end up being a six-month or longer supply.  The only downside to having the customer purchase the materials is the loss of a small amount of profit added to the cost of the material when quoting the job, which leads to my next topic.

If he was quoting a heavy part in an expensive engineering-grade material, he will never get the job because his part price would be through the roof. Conversely, if he was quoting a small part, like a bottle cap in an inexpensive commodity resin, and the estimated cycle time was 10 sec, but after getting the job the best cycle the processor could get was 14 sec due to poor mold cooling, now you are molding parts almost for free.

A key difference between the Senate and Assembly bills involves caps on the number of licenses: The Senate version eliminates caps, while the Assembly bill increased the number to 37 from 28.


  A commonality, but an addition since last week is an excise tax, which applies to specific goods or services and which consumers ultimately pay. The bill calls for a tax of one-third of 1% on marijuana sales. The state's 6.625% sales tax will also apply.


  The bills also allow the Cannabis Regulatory Commission to levy an optional additional excise tax. The proceeds would go toward “social equity” programs aimed at alleviating racial disparities, stemming from decades of Black residents being likelier to face marijuana-related charges than white people.


  Such funding was explicitly sought by the state's Legislative Black Caucus and other advocates. Assemblymember Jamel Holley, a member of the caucus, said the measure gives some in New Jersey the chance for a clean slate.


  “A key component of cannabis legalization is addressing social justice concerns,” he said in as statement. “The fact that Black New Jerseyans are 3 or 4 times more likely to be arrested on cannabis charges has contributed to the disenfranchisement of (Black) communities.”


  But some advocates like the Rev. Charles Boyer, the pastor of Bethel AME Church in Woodbury, called on lawmakers to require the additional excise tax, instead of making it optional.


  “Basically, it gives us a tremendous amount of beautiful window dressing,” he said during Thursday's hearing, adding that the tax was not yet a guarantee.


  It's not clear exactly when the marketplace will be up and running.


  The Assembly legislation calls for lengthening the transitional period until a full, recreational marketplace is in place from 18 months to two years. Under the Assembly bill, the main significance of the period is that it caps the number of cultivator licenses at 37, up from 28 in an earlier version.


  If the optional excise tax were applied, it will be tethered to the price per ounce of marijuana. If the price is $350 or more, the tax would be $10 per ounce, climbing in intervals to $60 an ounce if the price is under $200 an ounce.


  The measure also calls for the regulatory commission to give priority to businesses owned by minorities, women and disabled vets who seek licenses.


  The bill also changes the state's criminal laws, making it lawful to possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana. Public consumption would not be allowed under the measure.

Ask the compounder if you can send a sufficient amount of the base resin to be used as the colorant carrier. The reason is that materials have different natural colors--from crystal clear to chocolate milk.  Using the same base resin the part is to be molded in as the carrier will improve the odds of a perfect color match on the first sampling. It will also guarantee that the colorant is compatible, and improve the physical properties of the part. The benefits of doing this far outweigh any initial cost savings from using a less expensive generic carrier.

Sure enough, by midsemester, coronavirus clusters were erupting on and off campus: 11 positive tests in a week in the athletic department; 13 more tied to two restaurants near campus; 17 in one dormitory. In October, county health authorities ordered the campus to shelter in place, citing “social gatherings” on or near campus as a major source of infections.


  Now, after more than 2,540 COVID-19 cases among students and staff, the university is shifting course drastically. It has asked students not to come back to campus in January unless they have to. Each dorm room will hold only one person, forcing thousands of students to stay home or find off-campus housing. Instruction will be remote in 90% of classes. Students who violate certain health rules will face tougher sanctions, including automatic probation, and coronavirus tests will be mandatory for anyone coming to campus.

We now know that Biden will be president, but he won’t have the votes for FDR-size legislation.

And he should know, as Roosevelt did, that this means grappling with the left — all of the left, including its most radical edges.


  The Social Security Act of 1935, which established the nation’s old age and unemployment insurance programs, as well as its first stab at maternal assistance, represents traditional Democratic Party liberalism at its best: simple, broad-based and pragmatic. The basis for the American welfare state — and derided by opponents at the time as an example of “creeping socialism” — it remains a potent example of the power of government to help ordinary people. What the public knows is that it was the product of Roosevelt and the New Deal. Missing from this story is how much the law owes to the activism and agitation of the American left.

New details have been released regarding a Little Rock woman facing capital murder charges in the death of her child who was thrown from a moving vehicle on Interstate 30 near Exit 117 in September.


  Whitney Turner-Tyson, 30, was charged with capital murder, a class Y felony, and child endangerment, a class D felony, in September. If convicted, Turner- Tyson could face the death penalty or life in prison. She was denied bond by Judge Josh Newton in Saline County District Court.


  According to court documents, new details in the case have emerged, including official confirmation from investigators that the child who died was one of Turner-Tyson’s daughters. At the time of the child’s murder, it was widely reported that the baby who was thrown from the vehicle was one of Turner- Tyson’s children, but that was not confirmed by official sources until now.


  According to an investigative report from the Arkansas State Police, law enforcement officials received a call at approximately 9:05 a.m. Sept. 15 that an infant child was found lying on the inside shoulder of Interstate 30 westbound near mile marker 117.


  Arriving at the scene, ASP Special Agent Michael Garlington reported that the area where the child was found had been secured by ASP and Benton Police Department officers. He also noted that blood stains were found on the ground that resembled the shape of a small head.


  The child was taken to the Saline Memorial Hospital for treatment prior to Garlington’s arrival. She was later pronounced dead.


  While on scene, investigators learned that a black female, later identified as Turner-Tyson, had been involved in a minor vehicular crash around midnight. She was not verbally communicating with officials and had been transported to the hospital for treatment where she was admitted for a suspected drug overdose.


  ASP Sgt. J. Blackmon also responded to the hospital and met with the Saline County Coroner to collect evidence. While Blackmon was in the room, Turner- Tyson attempted to enter where the baby had been treated. After being denied entry, Turner-Tyson was discharged from the hospital and had not yet been identified as the infant's mother. She was later found walking on Carpenter Street.


  When contacted, Turner-Tyson would not speak with anyone and appeared distant. She was taken into custody and transported to the Saline County Detention Center and placed in an interview room.


  Garlington and ASP Special Agent R. Jacks attempted to speak with Turner- Tyson about her daughter, but she would not verbally respond. She would only shake her head yes or no in response to questions.


  Turner-Tyson then requested a cigarette and said that she would speak to investigators after smoking, which she was allowed to do.


  After returning to the interview room, Turner-Tyson again went silent for awhile and sat down on the floor in the interview room. Once she began speaking, Turner-Tyson identified the father of her three daughters and said that he could be found somewhere between Texarkana and Little Rock.


  Turner-Tyson then told investigators that she took her infant daughter out of her seatbelt and threw her onto the side of the interstate prior to crashing into a barricade a mile or more down the road. She also stated that as she threw the baby out of the car that the driver of an 18-wheeler blew their horn at her and that the driver may have seen what she had done.


  When asked why she threw the baby out of the car, Turner-Tyson stated that she was driving and thought she felt someone patting her on the back of her head. After that statement, Turner-Tyson again went silent and covered her face refusing to continue to talk, giving no further details to investigators.


  Turner-Tyson remains in custody at the SCDC with no bond.
