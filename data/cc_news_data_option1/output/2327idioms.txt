The Federal Communications Commission has "serious doubts" that low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite providers—including SpaceX—can deliver internet service while keeping latency under 100 milliseconds.


  In a lengthy report on the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund phase I auction (scheduled for late October), the FCC confirmed that while LEO companies are allowed to apply for rural broadband funding as low-latency providers, they should expect a fight. "Short-form applicants seeking to bid as a low-latency provider using low-Earth orbit satellite networks will face a substantial challenge demonstrating to Commission staff that their networks can deliver real-world performance to consumers below the Commission's 100 ms low-latency threshold," the FCC said.


  SpaceX has been hogging the headlines lately, over the weekend completing yet another Starlink mission, launching 58 branded satellites into orbit; Elon Musk's rocket firm plans to provide internet service in the northern US and Canada by year's end, with near-global coverage in 2021.


  SEE ALSO: The Fastest ISPs of 2020


  The company is confident its satellites' roundtrip latency is up to par for consumers and the Federal Communications Commission. "SpaceX explained that its system easily clears the Commission's 100 ms threshold for low-latency services, even including its 'processing time' during unrealistic worst-case situations," David Goldman, director of satellite policy, wrote in a May 29 letter to the FCC.


  Still, SpaceX has a lot to prove and little time to do it. While the firm has launched nearly 500 satellites, it isn't yet offering a commercial service. And companies must submit auction applications by July 15—one month from today.

Like many Bay Area residents, I grew up in New York (coming west for grad school in 1975), and like many NYC kids my parents shipped me out of the city’s heat for summer camp in the country: Camp Kinder-Ring, to be specific, a Jewish sleepaway up in the Hudson Valley. Considering the constituency, it’s no surprise I was far from the only nerdy non-athletic camper but I was toward the extreme. Assigned to right field in softball, a safe spot since none on the opposing team could smack a ball that far to the right, my best memories of camp are happily traipsing unnoticed off into the adjacent woods to wander about, wondering and happy in the presence of a natural world so unlike my pre-hip Brooklyn neighborhood.
 A tree perhaps did grow in Brooklyn although not on my street, but the upstate forests were rich and largely untouched. The first dark sky I ever saw was outside of our cabins at night, and the bioluminescent fireflies were a revelation. It’s only recently that I learned that these self-lit bugs can be found here in California as well, although I’ve yet to spot one (they are relatively rare), and a report of a new species discovered only a few years ago, in Los Angeles County of all places, led to a bit of research.
 Bioluminescence is light produced by living organisms, and the winged beetles we call fireflies or lightning bugs are just a few of those capable of this miracle, along with various centipedes, millipedes, snails, fungi, coral, jellyfish, octopus and squid, clams and plankton. Once so common that easily collected jarfuls of fireflies could serve as kids’ flashlights, habitat loss and insecticides have dramatically reduced the populations. Light pollution (street lights, houselights, car lights, etc.) has also contributed to the decline, disrupting the bugs’ real reason for glowing tails — that is, to attract mates. How is that light produced? Fireflies control the amount of oxygen entering their body to create a chemical reaction which produces light, although other explanations include an ancient Chinese belief that lightning bugs are created by burning gasses and the Japanese legend that they are the spirits of warriors fallen nobly in battle. You choose your favorite.

SamTrans hopes to restore service close to pre-COVID-19 levels and also potentially resume charging fares by August.


  Since the shelter-in-place order took effect in March, SamTrans has been forgoing fares — passengers can only board in the rear and away from the fare box to keep a safe distance from bus operators — and has been offering significantly reduced service. SamTrans in March suspended all routes aimed at servicing schools and others, bringing the total number of active routes to 29, down from the usual 69 routes.


  The agency has developed three possible scenarios moving forward: a quick recovery in which service increases in August and reaches pre-COVID-19 levels by January 2021; a “slow burn” scenario that sees the same jump in service in August, another smaller increase in January 2021 and then reaching pre- COVID-19 levels by June of 2021, and finally a scenario that anticipates a return of coronavirus in the fall. That scenario predicts enhanced service in August and then a return of shelter-in-place restrictions and the current, significantly reduced service levels by December and through June 2021.


  “Right now we’re tracking scenario 2 [the “slow burn”] as the mostly likely to occur,” said Principal Planner Millie Tolleson at a recent meeting. “But all of the information is changing very rapidly.”


  The option Tolleson described as most likely would result in 75% of original revenue projects for the agency next fiscal year.


  Tolleson noted none of the above scenarios quite reach 100% service levels in part because of an assumption that many bus operators will remain on leave due to COVID-19. Currently, 12% of operators are on leave for COVID-19 related reasons, but that doesn’t mean they are infected with the disease, Tolleson said.


  SamTrans is looking to recruit additional backup operators to avoid gaps in service due to an operator shortage. Board Member Peter Ratto suggested hiring should be doable these days given the number of shuttle drivers currently out of work with the prevalence of working from home.


  Before resuming charging fares, SamTrans plans to install Plexiglas barriers to protect the operators from passengers. The barriers are currently being designed and then it will take an estimated two months to install them so fares could be charged again by August if everything goes according to plan, but there are obstacles in the way of that timeline.


  “We’re getting new information there are issues with the supply chain at this point for Plexiglas. We’re not the only ones looking into this,” Tolleson said.


  In meeting the increase in demand as the economy reopens, SamTrans planners have lingering social distancing rules with which to contend. No more than 10 passengers are permitted on a standard articulated bus at a given time, though families and groups can be counted as a single passenger and ADA passengers are not counted toward the limit, according to the agency’s policy. Buses typically carry 41 to 48 seated passengers and 20 to 28 standing ones.


  To meet growing demand given those restrictions, SamTrans plans to restore service on routes that are at or nearing capacity, focus service in areas with low-income transit dependent riders and also add service during midday when there is crowding.


  Tolleson noted the above capacity limits may prevent the agency from fully meeting demand.


  “Our max loads may very well limit our ability to meet the demand as the economy reopens, as schools reopen, especially on routes that may not typically service groups or families like our school-related routes or our express routes,” she said.


  SamTrans planners are also facing challenges planning for school service, which of course is dependent on school districts’ plans for reopening, which are not yet decided. By the time school districts do figure out their plan for reopening, it may well be after SamTrans’ deadline for finalizing its schedule for the rest of the year.


  “One of the big risks is we may not know what the schools are going to do for a month, and also difficult for us is the schools may all do different things and that’s a huge challenge for us,” said Director of Planning Kristy Wegener.

Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) will be handling 50 more flights from Tuesday taking the total number of flights operating in and out of the airport to 100. The airport commenced its domestic flight operations from May 25, with restrictions from the state government to handle 25 departures and 25 arrivals.
 The airport operator-- Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) said, "Starting June 16, the airport is permitted to cater to a total of 100 domestic commercial passenger flight movements which includes 50 departures and 50 arrivals."
 Unlike other airports, the Mumbai airport was seeing 25 departures and 25 arrival flights as the state government had not permitted more flights to operate to and from the city. This was done as a precautionary step to avoid the spread of Covid-19 to and from other states. The 25 departure flights mostly operated to places like Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Varanasi, Kochi, Gorakhpur, Jaipur, Patna and Hyderabad.
 "The move will see an increase in the sectors that we are currently handling. We are glad about the new progress that has come in favour of CSMIA, and we continue to relentlessly work towards ensuring the safety of our passengers and smooth functioning at the airport," a MIAL spokesperson said.
 The airport received permission to extend its operations from 50 to 100 flight movements on Monday before which the airlines had already scheduled their flights according to the restrictions.
 "The airport operator has alerted all the airlines about the development and a revised scheduled of flights that will be operated on Tuesday will be made. This relaxation in the restriction is a big relief to all the stranded passengers who have not been able to fly back to their destinations," said an airport source.

External upgrades can be easier and more practical, though in some cases they don't provide as big a boost. Or they may not make as big a difference as you thought they would.

Given how much time she spends online, that seemed to make it worth the money.


  She didn't notice any difference.

  If you're running short on storage, an external drive is an obvious enhancement. Unless you only plan to use it to offload files you don't use often, you may want to avoid going too cheap. A slow external drive can be more annoying than uplifting. You can also potentially improve performance by booting from an external drive, though that depends on the connection and the drive speed.


  Another possible performance upgrade -- only if you've got a newer laptop with a Thunderbolt 3 connection, though -- is to add an external graphics processor, aka eGPU to boost speed in applications or games with heavy GPU usage. This can be a pricey upgrade, though, and the enclosure and the graphics card are frequently sold separately, which can obscure the true cost.


  You may want to consider moving to a newer version of the operating system if you're not on it already. I don't consider it a no-brainer, though. If your laptop's crumbling to dust, a newer version of the OS may not unequivocally improve things. And you also run the risk of losing the ability to run some applications.

" "People seemed to be wiping things down, we're just getting used to the new normal," said Christine Soprano, who flew in from Amsterdam.
 There were long queues early Monday at the Greek border with Bulgaria, the only neighbouring country approved by Athens for overland travel.
 State tv ERT said cars stretched some 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the border crossing of Promachonas.
 "We are restarting the country's most important production engine and we are putting an end to the anguish of 700,000 workers in the tourism sector," Tourism Minister Harry Theoharis said in Santorini.
 However, some of those 700,000 are still concerned about the coronavirus pandemic -- which has so far largely spared Greece with only 183 deaths.
 \- 'On edge' - "Everyone's scared, maybe we'll catch the coronavirus," says Orestis Papoulias, manager of a beach bar on the black sand beach of Perissa.
 "As soon as the tourists arrive, we'll get new cases," says Canadian Stephane Saat, who has spent 12 years as a tourist guide in Santorini.
 "If they tell us that there are too many cases, we'll have to close down again, but what do we do? We don't have any money left and we're on edge." The procedures for protection against the coronavirus put a heavy burden on hotels, says George Roussos. Each hotel must have a doctor per hotel, a room for possible quarantines and a local hospital capable of carrying out tests.
 Restaurateur Evangelos Gidaropoulos is among those who believe Greece's record of handling the virus -- with far fewer cases than other nations in southern Europe \-- will stand it in good stead.
 "I believe generally that people around the world will recognise that and prefer to come to Greece," he says.
 Bearing out his theory, Chinese tourist Max Han reflects that the government has "very good control" over the virus as he wanders the famous blue domes and spectacular cliffs of Oia.
 "I feel very, very safe here," he says. "That is why I chose to travel to Santorini and next week I am going to Crete. No problem for me to worry about the virus."

Em uma stream da Twitch hoje, o finalista do _League of Legends_ Worlds e ex- campeão da EU LCS, Rekkles, expressou sua opinião sobre os últimos lançamentos de atiradores.
 "Eu preferiria ver o a Riot atualizando atiradores do que lançando novos", disse o atirador da Fnatic. “Vai ser que nem o que aconteceu com Aphelios e Senna, onde os mais velhos estão tão desatualizados que não são mais jogáveis, e os mais novos são tão atuais que sempre serão jogados … Se eu pudesse jogar de Vayne em todo jogo que eu ia adorar.”
 Mais tarde, ele continuou a admitir que, embora os atiradores mais antigos possuam kits interessantes, eles simplesmente não são páreo para os kits mais recentes lançados. Rekkles deu Jhin como exemplo, dizendo que, embora o atirador tenha um kit "insano" e único, ele acredita que jogar de Jhin "não parece jogar _League of Legends_ em 2020″.
 A Riot Games tinha alguns limites nos kits lançados no passado, mas os últimos lançamentos de Sett, Senna e Aphelios parecem ter superado isso. Os antigos campeões parecem ficar no passado, pois não conseguem aguentar os designs únicos do presente.
 Embora as atualizações diminuam a satisfação de um certo tipo de jogador que adora jogar apenas esse campeão dessa forma, elas são necessárias para trazer de volta certos campeões que perderam o palco nos últimos anos. Nem todas as atualizações são bem-sucedidas, mas é um bom começo entender o que torna um campeão divertido e interativo e construir em cima disso.

Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) will be handling 50 more flights from Tuesday taking the total number of flights operating in and out of the airport to 100. The airport commenced its domestic flight operations from May 25, with restrictions from the state government to handle 25 departures and 25 arrivals. The airport operator-- Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) said, "Starting June 16, the airport is permitted to cater to a total of 100 domestic commercial passenger flight movements which includes 50 departures and 50 arrivals."Unlike other airports, the Mumbai airport was seeing 25 departures and 25 arrival flights as the state government had not permitted more flights to operate to and from the city. This was done as a precautionary step to avoid the spread of Covid-19 to and from other states. The 25 departure flights mostly operated to places like Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Varanasi, Kochi, Gorakhpur, Jaipur, Patna and Hyderabad. "The move will see an increase in the sectors that we are currently handling. We are glad about the new progress that has come in favour of CSMIA, and we continue to relentlessly work towards ensuring the safety of our passengers and smooth functioning at the airport," a MIAL spokesperson said. The airport received permission to extend its operations from 50 to 100 flight movements on Monday before which the airlines had already scheduled their flights according to the restrictions. "The airport operator has alerted all the airlines about the development and a revised scheduled of flights that will be operated on Tuesday will be made. This relaxation in the restriction is a big relief to all the stranded passengers who have not been able to fly back to their destinations," said an airport source.

If you're a fan of home improvement shows, you're accustomed to seeing contractors and homeowners wielding sledgehammers on demolition day as they tear down walls to create open-concept layouts.
 But in the wake of COVID-19, many are predicting a return to more traditional layouts as we use our homes for work, school, exercise and more.
 Many professionals now working from home, for instance, are craving spaces that provide a quiet refuge from the comings and goings of other family members so they can be more productive, including when attending virtual meetings.
 As a result, home offices need to be fully equipped, complete with ergonomic seating and comfortable work surfaces and lighting that also contribute to their well-being.
 Design trends are reactions to social change and needs so it's a given the way we design our homes will be different post-pandemic, reasons Karl Lohnes, editor at large of Style at Home magazine.
 "People will want rooms again and will want privacy, whether they're working from home more often or spending more time alone, perhaps being entertained by tech or audiovisual," he predicts.
 "I think open-concept spaces will only be popular in small spaces where maybe one or two people live. Open-concept spaces in family-sized homes will probably change," says Lohnes.
 Mobile partitions with acoustical properties could provide a viable solution to existing open-concept spaces. They're already common in commercial settings but the newest generation have a residential aesthetic thanks to a wider variety of colours and textures.
 With many believing restaurants will never be the same again, both kitchens and dining rooms are regaining importance. Once social distancing measures are lifted, imagine inviting friends over for a take-out meal from your favourite restaurant, perhaps with an international theme.
 Like countless others, Lohnes has discovered baking during the pandemic and has been taking his culinary journey to the outdoor grill, underscoring the renewed appreciation for outdoor spaces.
 He believes people will continue to shop online, making a parcel mailbox that keeps deliveries safe from porch package theft and inclement weather a must- have.
 The trend towards 'less is more' as homeowners recognized they had too much stuff to function properly in tight quarters and finally had time to declutter is also here to stay, Lohnes predicts.
 Jane Lockhart of Jane Lockhart Interior Design in Toronto has gazed into her crystal ball and expects homeowners will want resort-like amenities so they can enjoy their homes even more.
 "Travel budgets will be re-purposed into our homes," says the designer, TV personality and author. "Items such as full outdoor living spaces - including kitchens, lounge areas, dining and activity areas - will continue to be important. Homes or apartments with private outdoor space will become most desirable."
 With recent times shining the spotlight on the importance of fully-functional spaces, Lockhart expects kitchenettes with coffee bars and mini fridges will be incorporated into master bedrooms, basements or guest rooms.
 "If you have to self-isolate, you want to do it with amenities and style, so it doesn't feel like a sentence (but) more like a staycation," she says.   The demand for flexibility and function will continue to ramp up.
 "Although there may not be designated rooms for office space, permanent and pleasant working areas with storage and proper seating will need to be incorporated in homes," Lockhart says.
 "These will need separation from family and the ability to be closed off, especially in smaller spaces or condos. Closet spaces may now do double duty and become desks and storage behind closed doors."
 Gyms or flexible activity spaces will continue to increase in popularity so staying fit at home is a real possibility. "This would include access to internet and a monitor for training and storage for equipment if a designated room isn't possible," she says.
 The demand for smart technology on phones will continue to grow, allowing you to see who's at your front door and know when a package is delivered.
 "Garages, mudrooms, porches or spaces with a connection to the outdoors will need to incorporate safe drop-off zones for packages," she says. "This will eliminate direct contact and deter theft."
 Thanks to our newfound commitment to hygiene, Architectural Digest predicts antibacterial and antimicrobial surfaces like porcelain, quartz and granite in kitchens and bathrooms, stainless steel appliances, and touchless faucets and toilets will be trending.
 Some homeowners may event want a sanitary station in the garage with disinfectant wipes, disposable gloves, mask storage and a sink for handwashing, a 'decontamination' zone at every entrance and a mudroom where family members and their guests can disinfect outdoor gear.

On the apocalyptic "Black Rider," an ominously foreboding confrontation with death, Dylan is conversing perhaps with the Grim Reaper about his distressed and imperiled soul.

A Sony entregou ao mundo a primeira espiada no PlayStation5 que a empresa prometeu que sairá a tempo para as férias deste ano. Mas, embora o console faça parte da próxima geração de jogos, Shroud desconfia da capacidade que ele terá.
 Falando em sua stream do Mixer após a revelação do console, Shroud não ficou impressionado com o que viu, dizendo que o PS5 parecia "mediano" com a estética "hein", acrescentando que parecia um roteador.
 Onde Shroud teve seus maiores problemas foi no tamanho do console. Com um exterior elegante em branco e preto, o console deve ter por volta de 35cm de altura, 20cm de largura e menos de 10cm de espessura.
 Embora isso o tornasse um dos maiores consoles já produzidos, a perspectiva de Shroud sobre a revelação na quinta-feira era que o console não era grande o suficiente.
 "Estou preocupado porque parece muito pequeno", disse ele. "Não acho que seja tão bom quanto um console em termos de especificações, se for tão pequeno."
 Em março, a Sony disse que o próximo console teria um CPU AMD Zen 2 de oito núcleos personalizado, juntamente com uma GPU com 10,28 teraflops e 36 unidades de computação. O PS5 também virá com 16 GB de RAM GDDR6 e 825 GB de SSD.
 O CEO da Sony, Kenichirō Yoshida, disse em maio que o novo hardware do PS5 poderia chegar a ser até "100 vezes mais rápido" do que as iterações atuais do PlayStation e Xbox. Mas isso não convenceu Shroud.
 Perguntado por um amigo se ele achava que o PlayStation5 ou o Xbox Series X da Microsoft seria melhor, o streamer do Mixer parecia bastante confiante de que o console da Microsoft acabaria sendo o melhor console.
 "Será melhor", disse ele. "Mas não sei o quanto melhor."

  WEFSA, named after the five elements of nature (water, earth, fire, sky and air), was started with 117 members from across the State in 2014 boasts of 1,000 members now. WEFSA decided to pursue organic farming right from the beginning and produces organic farm products including organic turmeric, jaggery, traditional paddy seeds etc. The company, whose turnover touched ₹1.40 crore last year, also engages with farmers at the grassroot-level to raise awareness and empower them.


  The company is currently engaged in establishing a seed processing centre with a storage godown and a dhal mill in Perambalur, with financial support from the government to the tune of ₹60 lakh and ₹15.40 lakh, respectively, extended through the Department of Agriculture Marketing and Agri Business.


  The seed processing unit would process seeds of traditional paddy varieties, maize (as Perambalur is a major producer of the foodgrain), pulses and vegetables. The seeds would be procured from farmers, dried, cleaned and graded before being certified by the Seed Certification Department and sold. The processing centre includes a 500-tonne capacity godown. Pulses procured from the members of the company would be processed and packed at the dhal mill before being marketed as a branded product.
