Many a people who strongly held the unwavering view that Ghana can work again under strong leadership and good policies, were filled with unending joy and hope and that this administration will crack a whip on the age-old issue of corruption that had bedevilled our beloved country.

“Whenever we complain about the activities of the Electoral Commission, people think that the NDC is just making empty noise to disturb the operations of the Commission and also to make the Commission appear before the public as an evil entity”, he bemoaned.

The argument shouldn't, therefore, be about who is the bigger thief and who is the smaller thief; rather, it should be about who has the political will and tenacity to reduce corruption to its barest minimum if not to completely eradicate it. I do not seek to provoke but Ghana as a country deserves better than who steals big monies openly and who only steals bigger monies in a subtle and beguiling manner. Every act of corruption is corruption no matter how smart it was done. We deserve better than this as a nation.

Our president may be incorruptible as he constantly proclaims but as Dr. Arthur Kennedy succinctly puts it that a president who is not corrupt but permits corruption will ultimately be judged by history to be corrupt ... Each of the new scandals in this administration is a slap in the face that mocks the president's commitment to protect the public purse and his pretensions to incorruptibility..."

Through the political rhetorics of our president, he gave many hope as he painted the mental picture of an incorruptible government. This strong assurance of an incorruptible presidency was something good and soothing to the ears at the time and therefore I wouldn't be surprised if we all gullibly consumed it hook, line and sinker.

The president's words are always reassuring when he says that he did not come to public life to enrich himself. Yet under his administration, the nation has been rocked by corruption and numerous scandals involving key members of his extended family and their cronies. The effects of this issue of corruption can therefore not be overemphasized.

With the current happenings in the political scene; including the PDS scandal, the PPA saga, the Agyapa deal, the diplomatic embarrassment in Oslo and many more, I do not know how to keep this hope and faith that our President is incorruptible as he strongly claimed in the 2016 elections. The very words of Adam Curtis appear to be true as he asserted that nobody trusts anyone in authority today. It is one of the main features of our age. Wherever you look, there are lying politicians, crooked bankers, corrupt police officers, cheating journalists and double-dealing media barons, sinister children's entertainers, rotten and greedy energy companies, and out-of-control security services.
