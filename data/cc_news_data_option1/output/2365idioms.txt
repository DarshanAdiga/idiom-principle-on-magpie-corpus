Loren Vincent delivered at the right time in Tuesday's Salina Falcons' doubleheader against Hutchinson at Dean Evans Stadium.
   
 In a 15-all ballgame in the bottom of the third inning of the nightcap, and with time limit set to expire, the Salina South graduate put a barrel into a ball with a two-run triple to give the Falcons a 17-15 victory, completing the sweep. Salina took the opener, 3-0, behind a five-hitter from its three pitchers.
   
 "It didn't feel too good off the bat, " said Vincent of his walk-off hit. "When it was going out there, I was hoping it would drop and it did. After that, I booked it as fast as I could and got to third."
   
 Vincent got some encouragement from head coach Luke Curry who called time to talk to his batter. This came after the Falcons had knotted things up at 15 when Kade Barber scored on a passed ball.
   
 "He just told me to get something and get a barrel on the ball and do what you do with the ball, and that's what I tried to do and did," Vincent said.
   
 Curry said Vincent is a gamer and has made his contributions when needed
   
 "He's just finds barrels," Curry said. "He comes up and makes good contact. If we hit the baseball that hard, good things are going to happen."
   
 Hutchinson got out to a 4-0 lead on the Falcons before they put up six runs in the second inning to lead 6-4.
   
 The Colts then got to the Falcons putting up 11 to take a 15-6 lead heading into a potential last at-bat for the Falcons with the time limit rule approaching.
   
 "At that point, we're just talking to our guys and going and putting together a quality at-bat," Curry said. "If we could string together a couple of good at-bats together and get guys on base and chip away. We just tried to put together a few in a row and see what happens."
   
 "Our guys, they didn't hang their heads."
   
 Over the span of the 11-run rally, Salina was able to get three consecutive bases loaded walks and RBIs by Connor Anglin, Barber and Josh Weiser.
   
 Anglin went a perfect 2-for-2 at the plate with three RBIs.
   
 In the opener, the Falcons were hitless through the first two innings and got things going in the third with an RBI single by Nathan Farmer and a sacrifice fly from Jovan Suarez.
   
 Salina tallied its final run in the sixth with Farmer scoring on an error.
   
 Farmer went 2-for-3 at the plate with an RBI.
   
 Cooper Thompson threw four innings of three-hit baseball while striking out three. Weiser and Colton Bell combined for three innings of two-hit baseball.
   
 "They came out and set the tone," Curry said.
   
 Salina (4-2) travels to Junction City for a 6 p.m. doubleheader on Saturday.
   
 "It'll be another good challenge for us heading into the Grand Slam," Curry said. "We're just still trying to build our stuff up and strengthening arms and getting everybody into shape. So when July rolls around, good things can be rolling."

Asked if it would be a deal-breaker if Biden doesn't pick a woman of color Greene wasn't worried, noting that, "as far as the deal-breaker in any decision Biden will make, the deal-breaker for them is President Trump."
 According to reports, Biden has several prominent African American women on his vetting list for a running mate, including Senator Kamala Harris, D-Calif., former Naational Security Adviser Susan Rice, Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.
 Greene and Caldwell were both quite confident in one thing: the coalescence among young voters, especially young black voters, this election cycle is defeating President Trump.
 "They might not believe in the candidacy of Joe Biden, but they'll show up because they want to see Trump defeated and that's been the hard reality for a lot of young folks," said Caldwell, adding that social media activism only goes so far.

At the same time, I've been agonizing over the fate of my backyard peach trees, three dwarf varieties planted next to each other in a curved row akin to a "citrus smile." In a nutshell (the pun will soon make sense), their bounty of newly sprouted peaches-beautiful baby orbs twice as big as play marbles and covered in an adorable pink fuzz that begged for an electric razor-were being poached by squirrels, plucked from their stems in rodent raids both daring and dexterous. Whether it be a wild dash across my lawn and a leap into one of my trees, or a measured dive from a taller perch, the squirrels were relentless and creative in pursuit of a grab and go meal. It was impressive, really, and it was maddening, as I watched this feast of the squirrels unfold.

In the post-COVID-19 world, her search will be even more difficult.
 Home sales stopped in April because of COVID-19, but now that restrictions are easing up, available housing stock is being snapped up even as home prices are on the rise, leaving even more people out of the opportunity for home- ownership.
 “Some houses that were on the market last year and didn’t sell, they’ve come on the market now and they are jacking up the prices,” said Steve Drews, who is looking for a home priced in that sweet spot of $200,000 or less.
 Drews and his wife Louise retired, sold their Lapeer home and are living in an apartment while they look for a house near Frankfort in Benzie County.
 Shopping online was a frustrating ordeal while the couple waited out the state’s shutdown.
 “We’ve been watching houses up there come and go,” Steve Drews said. “The housing market is a feeding frenzy. Houses are getting multiple offers within days on the market. Anything close to $200,000 is a hot commodity.”
 In the five-county Grand Traverse region there is a potential demand for 2,813 owner-occupied homes through 2025 — with about half of those homes needed in Traverse City, according to a study done by LandUse USA for Networks Northwest and Housing North. The study, released last year, looked only at the demand for homes that would be lived in year-round.
 About two-thirds of those potential buyers are looking to pay less than $200,000, the study shows.
 As of Monday there were 1,474 single-family homes listed for sale in the region, according to information from the Traverse Area Association of Realtors. Of those, 357 were listed at less than $200,000 and 443 were listed at more than $500,000.
 The LandUse USA study was done before the pandemic, which will only worsen the long-standing housing shortage in the area and imbalance in wages and housing costs.
 “There will be people who’ve lost their jobs and will remain unemployed,” said Kathy Egan, community development manager for Networks Northwest.

The uncontrollable condition was dubbed a "super-stall" and resulted from the behaviour of the double-delta wing at low speed and high angles of attack. Ways of overcoming the problem were developed but, in order to be able to train pilots better it was decided to design a two-seat Draken. This was designated SK 35C (the J 35B was a recently launched fighter version with improved avionics) and, to speed up deliveries, semi-completed J 35A airframes were taken off the production line and retrofitted with a new forward fuselage, with two seats in tandem. Radar, armament and one fuselage fuel tank were removed and the improved thrust-to-weight ratio made the SK 35 faster than the front-line fighter, earning it the nickname "Saab 35 Sport".

The landward invaders of the kingdom were tackled with a similar mixture of force and diplomacy. Bardylis did not follow up his successful invasion, either because of the casualties his own forces had suffered in the battle, or because Philip had arranged a truce with him. Philip certainly bought off the threatened Paeonian invasion from the north by gifts to the Paeonian king. Neither of these measures could be decisive in the long term: gifts would only whet the Paeonian appetite, and Bardylis' victory could only encourage him to mount another invasion.

Sam Darnold is getting a fresh start. The 2019 season was a mess, marred by a WTF illness (mono) and an offensive line that gave him no chance some weeks. Less publicized was a painful left thumb injury that required offseason surgery. Despite all that, Darnold made statistical gains across the board in his second season, and now he gets to play behind a brand new offensive line that should be significantly improved. Add in the arrival of streaky playmaker Breshad Perriman, intriguing rookie Denzel Mims and the return of X-factor tight end Chris Herndon, and it's not hard to imagine Darnold ending the season as the best QB in his division. When's the last time you could say that about a Jets signal-caller?

Henry was an incredible workhorse for the Titans in 2019, piling up more than 400 touches over 18 games. That's rarefied air in league history, and it's fair to wonder if that workload is sustainable in the long term. (It's certainly the question the Titans are asking themselves as they weigh whether or not to hand Henry a big extension.) But in the here and now, we have faith Henry will continue to be a stud in 2020, even with Jack Conklin now opening running lanes for Nick Chubb in Cleveland. Ryan Tannehill was a revelation last season, and there are football heads smarter than me who believe he won't be a flash in the pan in Nashville. But Henry is the better player and safer bet to be the engine that carries the Titans back to postseason football.
