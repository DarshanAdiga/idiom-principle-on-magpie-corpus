SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers will play two home games in Arizona after new coronavirus regulations put in place by officials in Northern California forced the team to find a temporary new home.
 The 49ers (5-6) will host the Buffalo Bills next Monday night and Washington on Dec. 13 at State Farm Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals, because they won’t be able to practice or play games in their home in Santa Clara County for three weeks.
 The team said it will have information on practice arrangements later but it will likely need to look outside the area because the rules imposed by Santa Clara County will require the players to quarantine for 14 days any time they travel more than 150 miles.

“There are around 10,000 parking spaces in the city centre and many remain empty even while people sit in queues outside a full car park on Percy Street.
 “So if you can walk an extra few minutes to get to the shops, parking somewhere that’s close to your route in and where you don’t have to queue means you’ll save time in the long run, making your journey in and out of town much quicker and safer.
 “We know this is a busy time of year and we are asking people to think carefully about their journey, about the time of day they travel into town and about where they park as we all continue to do our bit to beat coronavirus.”
 If people are planning to come into the city centre, they have been urged to check the howbusyistoon.com website, which includes information on how busy it is and where there are available parking spaces.

State health officials have said they are seeing widespread community transmission around New Hampshire, including in more rural areas.
 Statewide, DHHS announced 514 total new cases Monday, though due to a Thanksgiving backlog, only about half came from Sunday’s results, which have not yet been fully processed. The other half completed Saturday’s total of 497. The state averaged 466 new cases per day over the week ending Saturday, an all-time high.
 Of the new cases, 20 were in Cheshire County, 81 were in Hillsborough County outside Manchester and Nashua, and two were in Sullivan County. (The county of residence was still being determined for about a dozen cases.)
 The state did not announce any new COVID-related deaths Monday.
 All but a handful of towns in the Monadnock Region now have at least one active case, according to DHHS. Topping the list are Keene with 93; Jaffrey with 14; New Ipswich with 12; Rindge and Peterborough with 11 each; Swanzey with 10; and Chesterfield, Winchester and Charlestown with eight apiece.
 In a separate announcement Monday night, DHHS said an outbreak tied to a Londonderry establishment, Stumble Inn Bar and Grill, has infected at least 11 people.
 The agency reminded Granite Staters to take basic precautions, including by wearing a face mask, social distancing, washing one’s hands often and staying home when sick.
 “COVID-19 continues to circulate in our communities, so all people need to protect themselves and help prevent further community spread,” DHHS said in the announcement.

Asia-Pacific accounted for the largest share of the market studied, due to the presence of several established vendors of analog ICs, as well as the established electronics industry, in the region. The region has emerged as a major automotive hub, with a maximum market share in terms of vehicle production as well as sales, as China continues to account for a large and growing portion of new car shipments, which drives the analog IC market.   - The region is dominated by computer hardware and smartphones. With growing demand for compact and light-weight electronic devices such as wearables, the analog IC market is bound to show positive numbers in the long run. There has been a significant rise in the usage of fitness wearables especially in the case of the population concerned about the fitness issues and other sportspersons. Therefore, this rising trend of wearable devices is expected to drive the market in this region. Also, IoT devices are dependent on analog devices to collect the data used for the devices operation, so the growth of analog ICs is projected to be robust, over the forecast period in Asia-Pacific.   - NXP Semiconductors N.V. is moving into automotive radar by partnering with Hawkeye Technology Co., that could cement its foothold in the Chinese market, which will help in the development of imaging radar integrating with analog modulated for processing power. The collaboration could open the door for the Dutch chipmaker to play a bigger role in China, where the growth rate of automotive radar is approximately twice that of the rest of the world, owing to which the analog IC market will grow in future.

 # Legislature passes speedy relief for unemployed workers and struggling businesses
 Sherry Robinson

 During the recent single-day special session, lawmakers showed up ready to get $330 million remaining in CARES Act funding out to unemployed people and struggling businesses. But even with the overall agreement on need, there was still debate over how to do it and who’s most deserving.
 The lone bill, passed and signed, will provide a $1,200 one-time payment to some 161,000 unemployed workers, including people who exhausted their benefits since Sept. 12; make grants of up to $50,000 to small businesses; dole out $750 in cash to people who didn’t receive an economic impact check previously; boost food banks with $5 million; and make $15 million available for emergency housing assistance. There’s also some money for testing, contact tracing, and vaccine implementation and COVID-related expenses of the courts.
 The state will add some reserves to do this while maintaining a healthy cushion (30% of general expenditures).
 At the urging of the Association of Commerce and Industry, the legislation calls for money not spent by Dec. 28th to revert to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.
 The grants to small business were the subject of questions on the floor. With $100 million, the New Mexico Finance Authority expects to help as many as 4,000 businesses and nonprofits. They must have 100 or fewer employees and show they’ve taken a big hit during the pandemic. The priority will be hospitality and leisure businesses and others in similar straits.
 Rep. Candy Ezzell, R-Roswell, wanted assurance that the grant money would reach rural New Mexico. “We have businesses all around the rural areas working to make ends meet,” she said.
 Rep. Patty Lundstrom, bill co-sponsor and chair of the House Appropriations and Finance Committee, said she and the Senate Finance Committee chair met with Marquita Russell, CEO of the Finance Authority, who promised them it would happen.
 Senate Finance Committee Chairman John Arthur Smith, defeated in the primary, won’t be in place to bird-dog that commitment. I’ve heard Lundstrom say many times that people in her position have a responsibility to make decisions to benefit the entire state, but she never forgets she’s from Gallup. The rural areas won’t be neglected.
 Ezzell also wanted to know that the Department of Workforce Solutions would dispense unemployment dollars quickly. Lundstrom told her the department has a system in place to distribute money, although those newly laid off will have to apply on line.
 Ezzell recalled that early in the pandemic the department was so slow responding to an avalanche of unemployment claims she was getting ten to fifteen calls a day. As we know, the department ramped up and overhauled its website. The bill provides a little more administrative support to Workforce Solutions.
 Just two years ago, Workforce Solutions Secretary Bill McCamley was a representative from Las Cruces posing his own questions on the House floor. I knew the high-energy McCamley would get a handle on his overwhelmed bureaucracy, and he did.
 Rep. Rebecca Dow, R-Truth or Consequences, wanted to recognize the sacrifices of “essential” workers with $600 in hazard pay for those earning less than $15 an hour. To do this, the state would have to cut the $1,200 for the unemployed in half.
 If I were unemployed, I would argue that at least the essential workers still had a job. But the proposal hung up on practicalities, like how to define essential workers, how much it might cost, and creating a new program to do it. McCamley said his department couldn’t do this before the deadline to spend the money.
 Dow’s hazard-pay proposal is just one of a great many pandemic-related issues that we can expect to see during the regular session come January. A lot of new lawmakers will take their crack at solving the state’s problems and discover the budget isn’t as large as their proposed solutions.

Stewart, also of Westgate Road, Newcastle, was arrested and denied a charge of attempted murder at Newcastle Crown Court.
 But he later pleaded guilty to wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm, which was accepted by prosecutors.
 Brian Hegarty, mitigating, said Stewart had "deep childhood problems" following the death of his parents when he was a teenager.
 The court heard how he had 27 previous convictions for 39 offences and was in breach of a suspended sentence order imposed in December last year for two counts of battery and harassment at the time of the city centre attack.
 Judge Adams sentenced Stewart to seven years and 10 months behind bars, of which he will serve half before being released on licence.

As we approach the end of 2020 we can all look back on a very challenging year. Covid-19 and the resulting lockdowns and closing of borders in Thailand has had a devastating effect on tourism and those businesses that rely on ex- pat trade.      Iain Flitcroft, Managing Director of Kvik Asia said "certainly 2020 has brought it's challenges, but it has also brought opportunity. Whilst areas such as Phuket, Hua Hin and Pattaya have been affected by the absence of ex- pats who might normally spend significant parts of the year here, the concept of the 'staycation' and the fact that people have begun to enjoy spending more time at home has brought an upsurge in demand for renovation and refurbishment. We have also used our time well to expand and reinforce our network of interior professionals so that when the borders do fully re-open, we are as ready as possible to maximise the opportunity".      Kvik Real Danish Kitchens in Thailand sell only 100% Danish manufactured Kitchens, Bedrooms and Wardrobes, imported directly from the Kvik factory in Vilberg in the North of Denmark. Kvik itself is part of the Stena Group of companies the third largest privately owned business in Scandinavia.      Iain continued "coming into 2021, customers may be concerned about the viability of suppliers when being asked to pay large deposits. With Kvik the customer can be confident that we are part of a large and very profitable group. Kvik, itself, has been making furniture for more than 30 years!"      Kvik says that 'everyone has the right to a real Danish kitchen'      What does that mean?
