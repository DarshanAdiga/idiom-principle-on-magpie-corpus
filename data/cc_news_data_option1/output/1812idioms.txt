No. I think, Jim, I think you're spot on. I mean, we feel really excited about where we're at right now because we've got over one-two of the U.S. corn crop plant, and we got about one-four of the soybean crop, but you got to remember, we got to get this crop harvested and produced throughout the season and plus we've got two seasons in Brazil. We've got a summer corn season or spring season, and then we've got the second safrinha season all there before we would even plant again in the northern Hemisphere. So we got a long way to go here, but I agree with you, Jim. The indications would indicate lower corn acres for next year, but it's still within that 10-year range that we've operated in.

We did not see a benefit from lower staffing or anything of the sort in the first quarter as we continued to pay our employees as our stores were open. The last one is really marketing, and our marketing expense in the first quarter is elevated, partly due to a tough comp from last year. So we started increasing our marketing spend in the second quarter of last year. And it was elevated throughout the year, and we continued spending at that elevated level into the Q1 of this year. So Q1 of this year had a very tough comp from last year, and we expect to continue to use marketing this year, but I don't think you'll see the elevated spend quarter-over-quarter for the remainder of the year that you saw in Q1 of this year.

The Bengals have a road-heavy schedule early, with four of the first six games coming on the road. Four of their final six games are at home.
 The season opener could be a battle of rookie quarterbacks. The Chargers drafted Oregon’s Justin Herbert with the sixth overall pick of the draft after parting ways with veteran Phillip Rivers.
 The Bengals’ first road game will also be their first primetime game, as they travel to AFC North rival Cleveland for a Thursday night game.
 Cincinnati plays the NFC East in 2020, leading to matchups against high- profile teams Philadelphia, Dallas, Washington and the New York Giants.
 The Bengals are at Philadelphia in week three. An interesting matchup will come in week 11 when Cincinnati travels to play the Washington Redskins.
 It can potentially be a quarterback matchup of Burrow against his former Ohio State teammates Dwayne Haskins and Chase Young.
 Washington drafted Young second, right after Burrow, in last month’s draft. Haskins and Burrow battled for the starting quarterback job at Ohio State. Haskins ended up starting at Ohio State in ‘18, with Burrow transferring to LSU.
 Burrow won the Heisman Trophy last year at LSU, leading the Tigers to a 15-0 record and National Championship. The Nov. 22 matchup will be the first time Haskins and Burrow will face each other as professionals.
 The Bengals will also host the Giants and their second-year quarterback Daniel Jones on Nov. 29.
 The Cowboys come to Paul Brown stadium on Dec. 13 for a week 14 game. Dalton signed as a free agent with Dallas to back up Dak Prescott after his release from the Bengals.
 The Bengals’ first game against defending AFC North champion Baltimore will come on the road on Oct. 11 in week five. Cincinnati will close the season on Jan. 3 with a 1 p.m. game against the Ravens.
 The first game against Pittsburgh will also be on the road, as Cincinnati will visit Heinz Field on Nov. 15. The Bengals will host the Steelers on Monday Night Football — Cincinnati’s second primetime game — on Dec. 21.
 The Bengals could also potentially see the second quarterback taken in the draft in Miami’s Tua Tagovailoa. The Dolphins drafted the Alabama quarterback No. 5 overall, and the Bengals travel to Miami for a week 13 game on Dec. 6.
 Cincinnati’s bye comes in week 9.
 Burrow, a 2015 Athens High School graduate, is 62-7 as a starter in high school and college. He led the Bulldogs to a 37-4 record during the 2012-14 seasons, then went 25-3 during the 2018 and 2019 seasons at LSU.

Thanks, Jonas, for the question. Part of it is, as you have said, we deliver seed to growers on pretty much as demand or real-time basis. So in North America, clearly, this market, the season broke early. And so really weather dictates, mother nature dictates kind of the flow of the business. You saw it in one of the charts that Tim Glenn was mentioning where, just in the last three days of the quarter, we had $100 million worth of deliveries of seed in North America. So it starts with a story around the season has really been favorable, and we've gotten off to a great start based on timing. But then I would add an intensity and a focus that our teams have had around the world. You saw it in our momentum that we carried through the fourth quarter of 2019. It rides on the back of one of the best lineups and portfolios that I've seen in my time with the business, both in Seed and Crop Protection.

But then third, there is no doubt that there are cost savings that are beginning to show up here at the end of first quarter, and we'd expect to see more in the second quarter that are associated with the crisis, the stance that we've taken around working from home, so travel was much lower. We've certainly taken a very hard look at hiring through the remainder of the year, our marketing, our promotion and our advertising spend also being affected. Some of those costs, you would expect to return a little bit into the next year. But by and large, we're taking a real critical look at all of these expenses, and I think what we've learned a little bit through this crisis is we've found some new ways to work, some new tools to work. And I'd expect that many of those costs will be able to count on as continued savings year-over- year. Greg, anything else that you would add to the explanation?

The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the League of United Latin American Citizens conducted a survey of more than 500 member Latino organizations, and found only 97 of them received money while the rest have never heard back on their applications.
 During the conference, Little was asked if the state would consider setting aside a portion of the $3 million to lend to specifically Latino-owned businesses, since so many fell through the cracks in the first two rounds of the Paycheck Protection Program. Little said the state does have some money set aside to potentially "plug up some of the holes" if Idaho Rebound loans still fall short.
 "Those businesses are connections to the Latino community," Little said in the conference call. "This whole system only works when people are going to work."

These delays may seem like a minor ordeal. However, many students were weeks or even days away from taking the biggest exam of their careers when the first round of closures occurred. Some had been in a highly-regimented “dedicated” period and suddenly were floundering. With no guidance directly from the NBME or Prometric, students began obsessively checking local government updates, refreshing testing site websites, calling test centers and scouring through speculative Reddit posts to piece together morsels of information. Even the local testing centers sometimes offered different information than what was presented nationally. The newest wave of cancellations is keeping medical students guessing by potentially cancelling appointments at random less than 24 hours before their exam with no guarantee of later test dates. In tandem with these cancellations, Prometric has also opened new seats at test centers that don’t seem to be open, leaving even students who never received a cancellation notice unsure if their test is valid. To make matters worse, students still have to cope with the personal effects of coronavirus as well. Many students are immunocompromised, have ill family members or families financially impacted by the pandemic. Continuing to study as usual is nearly impossible.

BOISE — The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced this week that Idaho families receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits can now purchase groceries online at Amazon and at Walmart.
 Idaho has been approved to participate in the United States Department of Agriculture online purchasing pilot project. SNAP recipients can choose in- store pick up or delivery, where available, but those who choose delivery will have to pay any delivery fee out of pocket. SNAP benefits do not cover these costs.
 “As stay-at-home orders are lifted, everyone is still encouraged to continue practicing social distancing, and this should help that effort,” said Kristin Matthews, program manager for Idaho SNAP. “At-risk and needy populations are still facing tremendous difficulty finding and purchasing food, and Idaho is continuing to explore ways to better serve them.”

Sure. The slowdown, primarily as a result of, as we mentioned in the conference call here, the shelter-in-place and the shutdown of certain manufacturing facilities. So I mentioned vehicle, and what I would like to remind everybody, as we talked about vehicle is that our Vehicle market is very broad based. Automotive is a small segment of that, but it's also agricultural vehicles, construction vehicles, trucks, buses etc. So what we saw and I think if you noticed in the automotive, primarily our automotive business today is in Europe and some in Asia. The European companies were pretty much shut down. In Asia, they started back up. So that business was back up and running. So what we've seen is the various degrees, the companies that have shut down are now starting to come back online with schedules for, I'll say, beginning of May, mid-May and on. So we will, we do expect that those businesses will start shipping again to those businesses. So that was in April, probably one of the big impacts, as well as the power sports market, that slowed down to a crawl as well.

They came up to speed and back up to speed very quickly. They implemented procedures internally that we emulated in the rest of our operations, which we think helped us protect our workforce, very well. So we left [Phonetic] what they did, and how they responded and the standard -- protective gear, sanitization procedures that they were using and so forth, and as I said that we have emulated that.

So clearly is an area that we have to pay close attention to, and we have to make some business decisions as how we're going to operate in the future given a scenario, where they will continue to exist or are they could worsen. I mentioned localization of supply, I think we're going to continue to drive toward that. And it makes good operating sense first off. Secondly, given the state of what may occur here in the future, I think it's also protecting ourselves and our customers down the road, but the tariffs have that impacts. And while we work through those to best of our ability, but we do think that in certain areas that they are definitely going to impact us or continue to impact us.

In this documentary marking 40 years since Peter died, aged just 54, we hear from second wife Britt Ekland, who has rarely spoken of their relationship, as well as daughters Victoria and Sarah, who were mostly left out of his will. Followed by Talking Comedy.

This regulatory and source flexibility allows us to be proactive, in not only how we think about sourcing product to meet customer demand, but also to optimize our supply and limit our risks for outages in the chain. In addition to this critical resiliency design element, we also have staged our formulation and packaging plant, which produce our final product as close to the end-use market as possible to be responsive to shifts in demand. This element, along with a broad logistics supplier base and strategic inventories all along the supply chain, provide additional agility in times of disruption.

Yes. It's going to be tough to get major savings on surface royalties. It just depends on that particular area and the lease and what the lease says. In some cases, you are required to buy on lease water and in some cases, the opposite is true. So there's certainly going to be some optimization that we can do. You could if you're buying water at $0.30 a barrel from one section, but two sections over, it's $0.10 a barrel, makes sense to buy from the cheaper section. So now that everything's slowed down a little bit on the optimization front, we're certainly looking to buy cheaper water and also dispose water on leases or acreage that has a lower disposal rate. So I can't quantify the savings there. There's certainly going to be some optimization, but I think the real savings is going to be on the true opex side of the equation where our service partners had reduced costs by anywhere from 15% to 25% across the Board.

Sure. As part of the process here, Jeff, we immediately implemented a, I'll call it taskforce, call it whatever you want, where we met every single morning and we engaged with our operations around the world. We still do that. And not everybody, every morning, but we still do that and we get reports on what's happening in the local facilities, what's happening in the local regulations and the government. We track if we've had any instances, and I can tell you that we have close to 2,000 employees. We had three confirmed cases, all three were in Europe. And they did not impact operations to any great extent. They were isolated cases, that we were able to take care of. And then, we had temperature testing earlier on. We implemented early on, hand sanitizing, social distancing, masks. We implemented that very early on. And we did -- there were people that were stopped from coming in to work based on temperature. Fortunately in those cases that there were stopped, I mean they were temporary and those employees did not end up having COVID-19. So I'd say to you that, as we watch and learn from what we see and we're -- again we are in Sweden, we're in the Netherlands, we are in the UK, we are in New Zealand now, we are in Portugal, so, we're in Germany, in China and we get some input, and some great input every morning here about how they're coming back up to speed and how they're dealing with it so forth on a local basis. So I think, I'm encouraged from what I'm seeing and what I'm hearing and how we're seeing the companies come back online and local governments and countries coming back online. As far as China, both our facilities are about 300-plus miles away from Wuhan. And neither of those facilities had any reported incidents, OK, or confirmed cases of COVID-19. And the entire workforce came back within a couple of weeks, it was back up and running. So I'd say we're prepared in the same manner. And while we had to do some, we had to do split shifts, and we had to control people coming in and out of the operations, it was a little bit inefficient. But I think it was effective and our teams of tailored that to become more efficient as we move forward, where business dried up in some cases and literally just dried up in some cases, we had to adjust and we did do that. One of the thing I would like to say is that, we have not touched, and it's part of our core values that are strategic heart beat here is that we, are a technology/know-how Company, and for us to win in the long term, we are an engineering company. And engineering in terms of manufacturing process, design process, glean [Phonetic] process, quality etc. And we are protecting those resources, and what we've done is, we've turned to focus now as soon as we had control -- the best of our ability control over the situation, we immediately turned to focus on the positive side, and the growth opportunities. And we 100% moving forward with securing those. So I'd say that's where we are and I just think that I can't say enough about what our team did here and I think for us, we believe the future is bright.

It is conceivable the league would play with some members not participating.
 Ackerman said there are hybrid scenarios that could change things, such as a campus opening late.
 On other topics, Ackerman said the league mitigated the financial loss from being forced to cancel its year-end men's basketball tournament at Madison Square Garden because it had insurance against the pandemic under a policy that also covered terrorism and other unexpected occurrences.
 The Big East was forced to cancel its annual men’s conference tournament on March 12 at halftime of the first of four scheduled games that day because of the escalation in COVID-19 cases. Ackerman had no second thoughts about deciding to play the game that day, saying city health officials, the league’s board and senior medical personnel from the NCAA also backed the choice that morning. Ackerman said the league has had event cancellation insurance for years. Many other conferences have similar policies for their major events.
 In the past two months, Ackerman said the league has talked to its presidents, coaches, doctors and the NCAA about the future and building a playbook for it.
 “Really everyone in the college sports community is trying to pick up the pieces from March and trying to figure out all of this uncertainty, this unprecedented uncertainty, and what our options are going to be, particularly this fall," she said, “and how they relate to practices, to competitions, to conference championships and, of course, NCAA championships.”

The Center Square) – University of Wisconsin System President Ray Cross has introduced a proposal to regents to make most of the university's 26 campuses smaller and more focused.
 "We've got to act now," Cross said. "We just don't have the time."
 Cross said the coronavirus pandemic, which will cost the UW System nearly $200 million this year alone, is pushing the need for change.
 ""We don't know the impact of COVID-19, but there is a growing, clear sense that we must make serious reductions in order to be viable and to offer a quality education," Cross added.
 His proposal would usher in several changes at every campus, except UW-Madison and UW-Milwaukee.
 Cross wants to cut programs, eliminate university jobs, and push the state's smaller campuses to find a niche.
 He said not every campus will offer every class that it does now, or every class that is offered at every campus.
 Cross' proposal would also push more classes online.
 That, as expected, has university workers, professors and their unions on edge.
 Jon Shelton, vice president of Higher Education for the AFT-Wisconsin union and professor at UW-Green Bay, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his union would "fight like hell" to protect the status quo at the state's 26 campuses.
 There is no specific price tag for the proposed cuts and changes. Cross said his proposal to narrow the UW System's focus and cut costs is necessary "if we want the system to survive on the other side of this pandemic."

I can probably name 10 stand-up comedians I like more than Seinfeld, but in this day and age where everyone wants to talk about the “best of all time” (is it Jordan or LeBron?), I think it’s funny (no pun intended) that in the world of stand-up, Seinfeld doesn’t get the credit he deserves. Not just because of longevity, it’s that he’s done it this long and is still funny (was Don Rickles really that funny his last 15 years?). Seinfeld is funnier on stage then Dave Chappelle, Lenny Bruce, Ricky Gervais, Kevin Hart, Chris Rock, and Eddie Murphy. So instead of watching a documentary showing highlights of Michael Jordan we’ve already seen -- why not watch one of the Top 5 comedians of all time -- with all new material.

 A former beach soccer goalkeeper, the 37-year-old Méndez is also the current coach of Spain’s men’s and under-21 beach soccer teams. He became a police officer in 2006 and since then had been sharing his time between the sport and the police force.
 “In the end, it’s all about dealing with people,” he said. “I have to make sure that my players understand our goals, our tactics. And I have to make sure that the population understands that most people are not allowed to go out. Sometimes I have to be tough with my players, and it’s the same as a police officer when someone does something wrong.”
 Both Méndez and Craviotto, who became a police officer in 2007, volunteered to patrol the streets after the state of emergency was declared.

In the nation of Nigeria, its the artistic Beings showcasing Nigeria’s Earthly reflection in Universal domain. A nation facing challenges. Both political and economic. When hopelessness arrives, the creatives show up. The harder things become, the more they work. The greater they create. The phrase, _going against the grain,_ does not equate to the amount of energy exerted, in channeling happiness and _hope_ throughout the land. When the people of a nation do not know where to turn, when anxiety threatens the very soundness of their mind, its the creatives swooping in to bring stillness. Re-centering the people, and reminding them that it will only be in re-creating desired visions, that things will change. A mental freshness is needed. Evolving out of the current structures, re-aligning to the natural planes of one’s country, and figuring out the real shape of movement. Nigeria’s natural design, and how such is applicable to the well-being and enhancement of Nigerian societies, is key!

SALEM -- Some churches are suing Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, arguing her coronavirus stay-at-home orders are unconstitutional.
   
 Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the lawsuit by the churches, including Elkhorn Baptist in Baker City, are being led by Common Sense for Oregon, a nonprofit led by former Republican candidate for governor Kevin Mannix.
   
 The Pacific Justice Institute is arguing the case for the plaintiffs. It says it "seeks to invalidate" three orders, starting with Brown's initial emergency declaration, signed on March 8.
   
 Lead attorney, Ray Hacke said plaintiffs are all over the state.
   
 "There's a rising tide of churches and churchgoers wanting to push back against Governor Brown's oppressive executive orders, and this case will hopefully remind her that she is not free to dispense with constitutionally protected liberties, even in emergencies," Hacke said in a statement.
   
 The suit argues that emergency powers only last for 30 days and after that Brown would have needed legislative approval.
   
 On Thursday Brown outlined a detailed plan for beginning to reopen the state in the coming weeks while stressing that reduced restrictions on businesses and residents could be rolled back if the virus numbers increase.
   
 Counties that have had few cases of the coronavirus and that can meet strict guidelines may be able to reopen certain businesses as early as May 15, including salons, gyms and limited sit-down restaurant service, under the first part of the plan. Additionally, the state will loosen restrictions on day cares and retail shops statewide on May 15 while monitoring how infection levels respond.
