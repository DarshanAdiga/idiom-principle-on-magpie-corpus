The reaction that followed the decision was sometimes scathing but often, unfortunately, favourable. Many welcomed the rejection of the building of private homes on the site, even though that housing would have added to the social mix of the locality and be delivered in tandem with social and affordable homes. Some observers on these pages went so far as to say that the decision would not even result in a delay in the provision of housing at the location, should the council executive simply decide to build.

Last month, Reynolds opened up to _Access Hollywood_ about being a "girl dad" of three. "I have three daughters, which I never in a million years would've imagined. I come from all boys," he said. "I have three older brothers--I'm the youngest of four boys, so for me to have three daughters has just been such a ride, and I love every second of it."
 "No joke, they're like the most capable people I know," Reynolds said of his daughters. "If anything got crazy or scary in my life, they're the first people I would lean on because they have wisdom and strength and they're calm under fire. They have courage under fire."
 Reynolds further explained how he and Lively remain present for their daughters while shooting all over the world. "We don't split up--like I shoot movies and my wife shoots movies, and we go travel all over the place and we just all go together," he said. "I think that's been the best part of it is that we really don't spend a lot of time apart. I get to spend a lot of time with my girls."

At the end of this abrupt year, companies take stock of the progress of their activity during this fiscal year. On the other hand, they also focus on measuring the efficiency achieved and driven by the productivity of their workers. But have companies succeeded in motivating their employees and retaining talent in the midst of a health crisis? In order to achieve these goals and stay in business, leaders looked to corporate profits. These have recognized that they must be factored into the goals of well-being and corporate culture, as they directly affect the productivity and creativity of the workforce.

 # Twinsburg girls basketball coaching staff gets creative amid COVID-19 pause
 Steve Batko
 Correspondent
 Twinsburg’s girls basketball program and first-year head coach Heath Savage won’t be left behind this winter.
 Throughout the COVID-19 crises and all of adversity that comes with it, high school athletics have been steadfast in having different ways to accomplish things when social distancing and safety protocols prevail.
 This innovation has not escaped the Lady Tiger program, even with a pause in activities in the school district.
 Savage, his staff and Twinsburg has been getting its share of work in to prepare for this season.
 The Tigers are working hard for whatever season that may come in 2021 – even if it’s a two-game season.
 As of now, the season opener is set for a home test against league rival Nordonia Jan. 9.
 “We have had an alternate practice plan that we have utilized since the season paused,” stressed Savage. “We will resume in-person practice Saturday [Dec. 19].”
 “The girls have a renewed appreciation for the opportunity to play this season,” added Savage.
 Twinsburg’s new-look staff also features varsity assistant coach Nikki Chuppa and the junior varsity coach is Mark Willis.
 Using technology to instruct and complete workouts and drills, Twinsburg uses a variety of platforms to deliver information and instruction to both the varsity and junior varsity teams.
 Some of the platforms that Twinsburg is using include Google Classroom, Remind, Google Meets, Jamboards, Flipgrid, Google Slides and YouTube, just to name a few.
 “We have created a varsity and JV Google classroom that players and parents were sent an invite to join,” said Savage.
 “There is a virtual practice schedule (Monday-Friday) in the form of a Google Meet virtual practice, which we can use for team meetings, check ins, season updates, and use to discuss plays,” explained Savage.
 Player attendance is taken at the beginning of each practice.
 “Team building activities are conducted during the meeting, utilizing breakout rooms and feedback is collected using jamboards that are shared,” pointed out Savage.
 A virtual playbook is uploaded for athletes to look at and study.
 “Jamboards are shared during the playbook review and players complete simulated play progressions using the frames of a jamboard to sequence player rotations and changes that occur as the ball or defenders move,” explained Savage.
 Athletes have uploaded YouTube videos for specific training and workouts to be done at home.
 Using actual basketball footage from the 2019-20 season through Hudl, Twinsburg can use the film study for a variety of reasons.
 “This is a film study that would occur just as it would throughout our in- person practice structure,” said Savage.
 “Coach Willis and coach Chuppa lead breakout rooms when necessary in order to deliver small group practice instruction to generate greater interaction and discussion,” add Savage.
 Savage noted that through Google Slides and Jamboards, athletes can discuss plays on their own to check for understanding, plus they can also share videos of a basketball drill or of a workout.
 Some of these tools will surely be used in the future by coaches during “normal” times.
 “Players are expected to participate in drills at home as well as be able to discuss offensive, sideline, baseline, and press breaker plays as well as defensive sets, including full court sets, three-quarters sets, and half court sets, and zone defense (a 2-3 zone),” said Savage.
 Early on in the pre-season and from the start, the Tigers have emphasized defense along with valuing each offensive possession.
 Some of these team tasks can also enhance a players’ confidence in communicating and also promote leadership skills.
 Twinsburg’s staff reveals practice expectations to the athletes and have regular sessions that include free throw golf, ball handling drills, guard shooting, post shooting, and the always critical cardio work.
 The Tigers play free throw golf with 20 attempted free throws, featuring a made basket is worth minus one point while a missed shot adds one point.
 “We feel that maintaining our daily connection to the players is critical in order to check in on each other on a regular basis for social and emotional well-being as well as making sure school work is getting done,” stressed Savage.
 According to Savage, returning players from a 7-15 unit include seniors Jada Austin and Nighyah Carthen, juniors Logan Pride, Makayla Busicnki, and Elliotte Schneeman, plus sophomore Genesis Carthen.
 “The senior leadership demonstrated by Jada (Austin) and Nighyah (Carthen) was very productive in our early practices in the fall,” he said. “Jada and Nighyah were chosen as team captains.”
 Savage noted first-year varsity players as sophomore Sophie Adick, junior Gabi Bonnizzio, sophomore Alexis Cellura, sophomore Lauren Glessman, junior Maria Pontius, and senior Christine Jiang.
 Austin, a four-year guard and returning scoring leader, has stood out for the Tigers.
 “The senior leadership of Jada has been a constant bright spot and has been highlighted by her ability to motivate teammates to maintain focus throughout the season’s pause,” said Savage.
 “Jada has a very high basketball IQ and has been a valuable asset during our virtual practice sessions and team film studies.”
 Most importantly, Twinsburg’s ingenuity has helped the club to stay connected and to possibly play as many games as they can safely.
 The idea is to have that positive outlook and remain active – especially for the senior student athletes.
 These activities can help athletes on and off the hardwoods, mentally and physically, and maybe perhaps, gain a perspective that has value even later in life.

The opposition New Democrats accused Mr. Kenney of taking too long to react to the recent surge in infections.

The answer was to say, in the long term, a spiralling infection rate is going to hurt businesses, so what we need to do is stop the infection rate and support the business while we’re working on that.”                                                                                                                                                                     Studies from places such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s business school have shown a relationship between lockdown policies and economic performance.                                                                                                                                                                     The evidence is clear, said Aidan Hollis, an economics professor at the University of Calgary: Places that act quickly with strict measures to control infections enjoy stronger economies in the long run.                                                                                                                                                                     “The question is, do you do this at a point with lots of deaths, or do you do it at a point with fewer deaths? But there doesn’t seem to be any kind of escape,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                     Prof. Hollis said it’s difficult for businesses to succeed with out-of-control spread in the community even if they are permitted to stay open.

The Kansas City Chiefs earned their ninth straight win to maintain control of the top seed in the AFC playoffs. Yesterday in a game heard on Newstalk WJAG 105.9 FM, Patrick Mahomes threw for 254 yards and three touchdowns in the Chiefs’ 32-29 victory at New Orleans. Mahomes’ scoring passes went for five yards each to Tyreek Hill and Mecole Hardman as Kansas City improved to an NFL-leading 13-1. The Chiefs also spoiled the return of Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who missed five straight games with broken ribs and a punctured lung. Brees passed for 234 yards and three TDs, but he completed less than half of his passes and was intercepted for just the fourth time this season. The 10-4 Saints missed a chance to clinch the NFC South for a second straight week and now are longshots to capture the NFC’s top seed.
 Christian Bishop scored 19 points with five rebounds to lead five players in double figures and ninth ranked Creighton beat home-team UConn 76-74 in overtime yesterday in the Huskies’ return to the Big East. The Bluejays secured the win with a 9-0 run in the extra period. James Bouknight scored a career-high 40 points for the Huskies, who were playing for the first time in 17 days because of coronavirus-related issues. This was UConn's first Big East game since 2013. Creighton’s Damien Jefferson hit a short jumper in the final seconds of regulation to force overtime. The Bluejays are now 6-2 overall and 2-1 in the BIG EAST while the Huskies are 3-1 overall and 0-1 in the conference.
 Aleksa Gulbe scored 18 points with twelve rebounds to lead three players in double figures and 15th ranked Indiana drubbed Nebraska 81-45 in the Hoosiers’ Big Ten Conference opener. Following a 13-9 first quarter, home-team Indiana went on a 14-5 run in the first five minutes of the second. Gulbe buried a three-pointer, recorded a three-point play and added a layup to start the run. The Hoosiers, who are now 3-2 overall, went on to a 38-19 halftime lead and was never challenged in the second half. Isabelle Bourne scored 16 points with six boards and two blocked shots for Nebraska. Teammate Bella Cravens had twelve points. The Huskers fall to 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the conference.
 Nebraska’s football season is officially over. The team has opted not to play in a bowl game, NU announced yesterday. Coach Scott Frost said he would leave it to his players to decide whether they wanted to play again after a 28-21 win Friday night against Rutgers, and the decision to turn down a bowl chance was made during a meeting Saturday. Nebraska, who finished 3-5, almost certainly would have ended up with a bowl bid and likely would have drawn interest from several games, both within the Big Ten’s regular tie-ins and from without in the event that the Big Ten filled its spots. The fact that conversations of teams not playing were happening in the first place, though, speaks to the larger issues at hand. Many teams have decided not to play in the postseason because of the trying season that has already unfolded and the impacts that the coronavirus pandemic has had both on and off the field.
 The Lutheran High Northeast boys basketball team is 4-2 on the season after a 65-32 road win at Homer last Friday. This year the Eagles have earned victories over Wisner/Pilger, West Point Guardian Angels Central Catholic, Pender, and Homer while falling to Twin River and Norfolk Catholic. Lutheran High Northeast is outscoring their opponents on average through six games 59.2-50.5. The Eagles’ remaining home schedule includes games with Walthill, Humphrey St. Francis, and Riverside. They will compete in the Stanton Holiday Tournament December 28 & 29 where they will play 2-4 West Holt on the opening day, and the Wausa Post Holiday Tournament on January 8-9.

The evidence shows that in Ireland, as elsewhere, this can be done efficiently and at a cost that is not out of line with the direct build of those homes by local authorities.

LORIENT, France
 A groundskeeper at the stadium of French soccer team Lorient died on Sunday after lighting equipment fell on him following a game, the club said.
 The accident occurred shortly after Rennes beat Lorient 3-0 at Stade du Moustoir in northwest France. The club did not immediately identify the man.
 The light therapy equipment is used to heat the pitch and is wheeled on and off the field between games.
 The city's mayor, Fabrice Loher, said police had begun an investigation into how the accident occurred, according to the daily Ouest France.
 Several Lorient players were reportedly still on the sidelines when the accident took place in one of the penalty areas. Emergency personnel treated him on the field. He died at an area hospital, media reports said.

BERLIN: A growing list of European Union nations and Canada barred travel from the UK on Sunday and others were considering similar action, in a bid to block a new strain of coronavirus sweeping across southern England from spreading to the continent.   France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Ireland and Bulgaria all announced restrictions on UK travel, hours after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that Christmas shopping and gatherings in southern England must be canceled because of rapidly spreading infections blamed on the new coronavirus variant.   Johnson immediately placed those regions under a strict new Tier 4 restriction level, upending Christmas plans for millions.   France banned all travel from the UK for 48 hours from midnight Sunday, including trucks carrying freight through the tunnel under the English Channel or from the port of Dover on England’s south coast. French officials said the pause would buy time to find a “common doctrine” on how to deal with the threat, but it threw the busy cross-channel route used by thousands of trucks a day into chaos.   The Port of Dover tweeted Sunday night that its ferry terminal was “closed to all accompanied traffic leaving the UK until further notice due to border restrictions in France.”   Eurostar passenger trains from London to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam were also halted.   Germany said all flights coming from Britain, except cargo flights, were no longer allowed to land starting midnight Sunday. It didn’t immediately say how long the flight ban would last. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said he was issuing a flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight “out of precaution.” “There are a great many questions about this new mutation,” he said, adding he hoped to have more clarity by Tuesday.   Canada announced its own ban Sunday night. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement that for 72 hours starting at midnight Sunday, “all flights from the UK will be prohibited from entering Canada.” He added that travelers who arrived Sunday would be subject to secondary screening and other health measures. A follow-up statement from the government said cargo flights were not included in the ban.   The Central American nation of El Salvador, meanwhile, said it would refuse entry to anyone who has visited Britain in the preceding 30 days.   The British government said Johnson would preside at a meeting of the government’s crisis committee, COBRA, on Monday in the wake of the other nations’ measures. They come at a time of huge economic uncertainty for the UK, less than two weeks before it leaves the EU’s economic structures Dec. 31, and with talks on a new post-Brexit trade relationship still deadlocked.   Johnson said Saturday that a fast-moving new variant of the virus that is 70% more transmissible than existing strains appeared to be driving the rapid spread of new infections in London and southern England in recent weeks. But he stressed “there’s no evidence to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness,” or that vaccines will be less effective against it.   On Sunday, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock added to the alarm when he said “the new variant is out of control.” The UK recorded 35,928 further confirmed cases, around double the number from a week ago.   Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, called a special crisis meeting on Monday to coordinate the response to the virus news among the bloc’s 27 member states.   The Netherlands banned flights from the UK for at least the rest of the year. Ireland issued a 48-hour flight ban. Italy said it would block flights from the UK until Jan.6, and an order signed Sunday prohibits entry into Italy by anyone who has been in the UK in the last 14 days.   The Czech Republic imposed stricter quarantine measures from people arriving from Britain.   Beyond Europe, Israel also said it was banning flights from Britain, Denmark and South Africa because those were the countries where the mutation is found.   The World Health Organization tweeted late Saturday that it was “in close contact with UK officials on the new #COVID19 virus variant” and promised to update governments and the public as more is learned.   The new strain was identified in southeastern England in September and has been spreading in the area ever since, a WHO official told the BBC on Sunday.   “What we understand is that it does have increased transmissibility, in terms of its ability to spread,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead on COVID-19.   Studies are under way to better understand how fast it spreads and whether “it’s related to the variant itself, or a combination of factors with behavior,” she added.   She said the strain had also been identified in Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia, where there was one case that didn’t spread further.   “The longer this virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to change,” she said. “So we really need to do everything we can right now to prevent spread.”   Viruses mutate regularly, and scientists have found thousands of different mutations among samples of the virus causing COVID-19. Many of these changes have no effect on how easily the virus spreads or how severe symptoms are.   British health authorities said that while the variant has been circulating since September, it wasn’t until the last week that officials felt they had enough evidence to declare that it has higher transmissibility than other circulating coronaviruses.   Patrick Vallance, the British government’s chief scientific adviser, said officials are concerned about the new variant because it contained 23 different changes, “an unusually large number of variants” affecting how the virus binds to and enters cells in the body.   Officials aren’t certain whether it originated in the UK, Vallance added. But by December, he said it was causing over 60% of infections in London.   US President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee for US surgeon general said Sunday that the emergence of the new strain doesn’t change the public health guidance on precautions for reducing the spread of the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing and washing hands.   “While it seems to be more easily transmissible, we do not have evidence yet that this is a more deadly virus to an individual who acquires it,” Vivek Murthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “There’s no reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed will not be effective against this virus, as well.”   Europe has been walloped this fall by soaring new infections and deaths due to a resurgence of the virus, and many nations have reimposed a series of restrictions to reign in their outbreaks.   Britain has seen over 67,000 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest confirmed toll in Europe after Italy. Europe as a whole has recorded nearly 499,000 virus deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts believe is an undercount, due to limited testing and missed cases.   The European Medicines Agency, meanwhile, is meeting Monday to approve the first COVID-19 vaccine for the European Union’s 27 nations, bringing vaccinations closer for millions of EU citizens. The vaccine made by German pharmaceutical company BioNTech and American drugmaker Pfizer is already in use in the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries.   The EMA moved up its assessment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by a week after heavy pressure from EU governments, especially Germany, which has said that after the EMA approval it could start vaccinating citizens as early as next Sunday.   In an urgent address to the nation on Saturday, Johnson ordered all non- essential shops, hairdressers and gyms in London and large parts of southern England closed and told Britons to reorganize their holiday plans. No mixing of households is allowed indoors in the region, and only essential travel is permitted. In the rest of England, people will be allowed to meet in Christmas bubbles for just one day instead of the five that were planned.   After he spoke, videos emerged online showing crowds of people at London’s train stations, apparently making a dash for places in the UK with less stringent coronavirus restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock called those scenes “totally irresponsible.”   While Hancock insisted officials had acted “very quickly and decisively,” critics said Britain’s Conservative government should have moved against rising infections much earlier.   “The alarms bells have been ringing for weeks, but the prime minister chose to ignore them,” said Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party. “It is an act of gross negligence by a prime minister who, once again, has been caught behind the curve.”
