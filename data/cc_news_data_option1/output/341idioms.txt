Yet you can hardly blame City. They were able to go through the motions after Ream pulled down Jesus in the box, with no intent to the play the ball.
 It was an obvious foul, and a senseless one, as Gundogan stepped up to the convert the penalty anyway. At 1-0 down it was a mountain for Fulham. Without their captain, it was mission impossible.
 They mustered one shot on goal, and had a mild penalty claim themselves in the second half, but really, it was game that resembled those run throughs without the ball, that obsessive coaches do in the build up to matches.

Earl R. Yegerlehner, 97, of Clay City, passed away January 11, 2020 at 6:55am at the Cloverleaf Healthcare Facility. He had been a resident there just this past year. Earl was born August 11, 1922 in Clay County, the son of Samuel Yegerlehner and Esther Zurcher Yegerlehner. He graduated from Clay City High School, Class of 1940. While still in high school, he began farm work with a team of horses. At dawn he would gather and shuck corn filling his wagon before and after school. Farming has always been a part of Earl’s life. In years past dairy cows, beef cattle, chickens and pigs were on the farm, as well as corn, beans, wheat, oats, and hay.
 Earl was united in marriage to Imogene Brown Yegerlehner on August 15, 1943. Together they raised their family on the farm and worked together in the garden and whatever needed to be done. They were active members of St. Peters Evangelical and Reformed Church, which later became First United Church of Christ. Earl served in many capacities at the church, including trustee, deacon, and elder. He was a valued member. Earl enjoyed music and for several years sang in a quartet. He was a member of the Rural Youth Group and later was a Farm Bureau member, served on the County Extension Board, the 4-H Council, and the advisory board for Clay City High School FFA.

In 2007, Broaders went on the run when he escaped from Thomas Embling Hospital, a high security mental facility in Fairfield, Victoria, where he was admitted after a 1999 conviction.
 He was being transferred to another hospital for an appointment when nurses lost sight of him, the Herald Sun reported at the time.
 Broaders managed to make it across statelines to Adelaide but was arrested five days later.
 He reportedly tried to throw authorities off his scent by shaving his facial hair.
 In 1997, he was accused of preying on a 10-year-old girl at festival by asking her if she wanted a massage before undressing her and molesting her.
 Broaders continued to offend by convincing young women to let him massage them, including a 19-year-old in Camberwell in 1999 and a Burwood store employee days later.
 He was given a four-year and 11-month sentence with a non-parole period of three years, but was ordered to be kept at the hospital by a County Court judge at the end of his sentence.
 He is described as being of Caucasian appearance, about 175cm tall, of thin build with a grey and white beard and bald head.

When reviewing the capital outlay budget, an annual process for the Newton Board of Education, the request expenditures usually total more than the funding provided to the district. In an effort to grant more requests, the school board began talks of additional funding options in December.
 Coming back to that discussion, alternative funding for smaller scale projects was a focus at the first board meeting of 2020, with Bret Shogren of Stifel Nicolaus and Company helping the board understand some of the options that exist -- such as using capital outlay bonds or increasing the local option budget tax.
 As it stands, the school board has the option to increase the funding from its local option budget to 33% (which it was noted would have an impact of about 2 mills) or potentially dedicate some mills from capital outlay to pay for a special bond, though Shogren noted that would be tricky.
 "The process to issue capital outlay bonds is a little challenging," Shogren said.
 Several statutes exist that dictate how capital outlay bonds can be used, which has led other districts to seek the advice of the Kansas Department of Education when going that route.
 While there are some difficulties, Shogren noted there are some advantages that come with those tax-exempt bonds.
 "It allows you to borrow money up front that you would've paid for in capital outlay and lock in construction prices today," Shogren said.
 "This would be an option in the short-term to address some of the problems presented," said USD 373 director of business services Matt Morford.
 Many needs exist among the capital outlay requests (some left over from the failure of the recent bond issue), and a capital outlay bond could help cover some of that work, but not all of it. Morford also did not recommend utilizing more than 4 mills from the capital outlay fund for such a bond payment if pursued -- even though it is is just committing dollars currently received in revenue towards a bond payment, as superintendent Deb Hamm put it.
 Local option budget funds are a little different, with the board having the authority to levy up to 33% of that fund (and currently levying around 30%, with increased valuations allowing the board to hold steady in recent years). Because that would be an increase over what is currently being utilized, there would be an impact of roughly 2 mills to local taxpayers. With the structure of the local option budget though, Morford noted more of that funding is spread out among all taxpayers in Kansas.
 Hamm noted that, historically, when the local option budget was first established it was intended to pay for "extra things" that state funding did not provide. Over time, it came to be used primarily for operating expenses -- but an increase in LOB authority would allow the school board to pursue some of the "extra things" the district needs. It was also noted there is a timeline if the board wants to utilize more LOB funds, with the state needing to know by April 1.
 Both capital outlay bonds and an increase in the LOB authority would be subject to a protest period after the publication of public notices and some board members raised concerns about what that could lead to given the failure of the bond vote, especially given the impact on citizens tied to the LOB option.
 "Choosing to raise taxpayers' taxes after they failed two bonds of ours is not something you take lightly," said board vice president Jennifer Budde.
 Additionally, whatever route is pursued it was noted either one (along with a third focused on energy performance, on which information is still being gathered) would not be enough to substantially address all the work requests. Putting all of that off, though, comes with its own issues.
 "Either of those funds will not address all the needs," Hamm said.
 "If you don't fix it now, it's gonna be more expensive in the future," Morford added.
 Board members deferred taking any official action until the next regularly scheduled meeting on Jan. 27.

 On the evening of October 5th 1962 an Oldham-born DJ put a record on his turntable.
 It was the seed for what would become a world-wide cultural revolution.
 The DJ was Tony Prince, and the rare 'demonstration' single was by a young band from Liverpool.
 He had a show on Radio Luxembourg - a magnet for teenagers throughout Europe.
 The song was Love Me Do by The Beatles, and it was the first time they had been played on the radio.
 Pop would never be the same.
 Now, the actual single Tony Prince played is up for auction with a price of £15,000.
 The record has the most famous spelling mistake in the history of EMI, with the songwriters being named as 'Lennon and McArtney'.
 It is the star exhibit in a vast collection of Tony's which will go under the hammer at Omega Auctions in Warrington on January 28.
