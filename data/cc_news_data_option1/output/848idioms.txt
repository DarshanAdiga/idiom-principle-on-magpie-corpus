Harley-Davidson is starting the week in search of a new boss, seeking someone who can stem years of declining sales at the iconic American motorcycle maker just as it's starting to roll out some new products.
   
 Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich unexpectedly stepped down Friday, parting ways with the board after a 26-year career at Harley-Davidson -- including five years as CEO in which the company lost more than half its market value. Board member Jochen Zeitz will fill the job for now, the company said after the close of business Friday.
   
 Harley shares rose as much as 5%, to $32.06, in after-hours trading after the news, suggesting investors were ready for a change at the Milwaukee-based manufacturer.
   
 "An external hire that can look at the business with fresh and critical eyes is needed," Joseph Spak, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to investors. That said, "the stock could be in limbo until a new, permanent CEO is named."
   
 Levatich had been wrestling with several headwinds as CEO, including an aging customer base in the U.S., its biggest market, and heightened tariff costs from President Donald Trump's trade wars. Harley's first electric motorcycle, LiveWire, won positive reviews but has yet to kickstart sales or help it achieve greater market share abroad.
   
 Harley was caught flat-footed by competition from more affordable, lightweight bikes as heavy motorcycles like the one Marlon Brando rode in the movie "The Wild One" went out of style, said David MacGregor, an analyst at Longbow Research in Independence, Ohio.
   
 "They're finally figuring it out, but they're three years behind the curve," he said by phone. "The board members and investors were just not willing to wait."
   
 The new CEO would come aboard as Harley is entering new segments with less expensive middleweight bikes, small displacement motorcycles for Asia, and a slew of electric bikes. It's also been tweaking its iconic logo and acquiring a kids e-bike company to attract younger riders.
   
 Even with the yearslong slump in sales, "we are surprised by the timing of the leadership change ahead of major new product launches scheduled over the next few years," analysts Sharon Zackfia and Tania Anderson of William Blair & Co., wrote in a note.
   
 Harley's shares have plunged 18% this year, and its $4.6 billion market capitalization is down by more than half from when Levatich took over.
   
 U.S. sales dropped for a fifth straight year in 2019. That period covers most of Levatich's tenure as CEO, which began in May 2015. Retail sales in the U.S. have risen once in the past 21 quarters. That inability to spur growth presaged an earnings miss when Harley reported its latest quarterly profits in January.
   
 As recently as last month, Levatich expressed confidence that the company was on the road to recovery. "Our return to growth is not in the distance -- it's right around the corner, and 2020 is our pivotal year," the CEO told investors on a Jan. 28 earnings call.
   
 Levatich's departure comes after the company moved in January to grant long- term shareholders the power to directly nominate board members, a concession meant to boost investor influence.
   
 Harley's effort to investing in new products to appeal to a younger demographic has added pressure to margins. To help find younger buyers, Levatich hired the company's first-ever brand president in April, only to dismiss him six months later, citing unspecified conduct that didn't align with its corporate culture.
   
 The stock staged a recovery in late 2016 when a new engine briefly boosted U.S. sales volumes and Levatich, 55, announced a restructuring plan designed to save the company millions. But the boom proved short-lived.
   
 "They had it, they lost it, they got it back and lost it again," said Ken Harris, co-founder of Cadent Consulting, a Chicago-based marketing and sales consulting firm. "When people aged out, they had no one to replace those buyers."
   
 "A millennial would rather have a powered scooter than a Harley Davidson," Harris said. "I'm not surprised that they had to make a change."
   
 Levatich's tenure came at a time when many manufacturers were tested by mounting tensions between the U.S. and its biggest trading partners. The Harley CEO went from being one of the first company leaders to be welcomed to the White House in early 2017 to contending with angry tweets about closing a U.S. factory and adding production overseas to avoid tariffs.
   
 Those extra costs dented profits at the company, which had pinned its near- term turnaround hopes on growth in international markets. After Harley announced in June 2018 that it would shift some production out of the U.S. to sidestep tariffs imposed by the European Union in retaliation for U.S. levies on imported aluminum and steel, Trump attacked the company for months -- even threatening to back a boycott of the company's bikes.
   
 Harley went ahead with plans to ship motorcycles to Europe and China from a new factory in Thailand, which allowed it to mitigate almost all of a $100 million cost burden from the tariffs on U.S.-made bikes. This was part of an effort to get half of its revenue from outside the U.S. by 2027, but that promised growth hasn't come fast enough to offset the drag from the steady decline in sales in its home market.
   
 Levatich's acting replacement, Zeitz, who's been on Harley's board since 2007, was named chairman as part of the reshuffling announced Friday. The company said he will remain in that role "once a new CEO is appointed" as a permanent replacement.
   
 Zeitz was the youngest executive to head a German public company when he became CEO of sporting-goods maker Puma in 1993. The 56-year-old led the company for nearly 18 years, increasing sales about 15 times over his tenure.
   
 He also is a philanthropist who collects African art, which is in the eponymous Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town, South Africa.

The Lancers (18-4) now move along to the semifinal round of the postseason sweepstakes Tuesday evening (7:30 p.m.) at Taunton High against No. 1-seeded, 19-game winner Rockland.
 “We were doing all sorts of different stuff (defensively) in the first half, so we talked about it and said let’s just go ‘man,’ “ Liberatore said of the strategy to take away Fairhaven’s shooting skills. The Blue Devils shot just 3-for-14 against a mixed bag of Lancer defenses in the first quarter, then hit two 3-pointers in the second quarter.
 “They can shoot it pretty good, that’s how they won their 15 games,” Liberatore added. “In the first half, they moved the ball pretty well and got some open looks. We’ve played more zone than man this year, but in games like this you’ve got to play man. We rebounded the ball well too; a lot of times they were one-and-done.”
 At the outset of the second quarter, Murphy converted a drive into a three- point play, then a Cochrane steal resulted in another three-point play for Norton and a 19-8 lead. And true to team concepts, Coffey fetched an offensive rebound as the shot clock expired, was fouled and hit two free throws.
 Then within the first minute of the second half, Belcher converted a three- point play, and a minute later McNichols converted a steal (one of 12 second- half Fairhaven turnovers) into two points.
 The Lancers might have won by 30 points-plus too were it not for missing four third-quarter free throws, seven fourth-quarter free throws, and 13 overall.
 “We told the kids, it’s not ending here,” Liberatore said to incite his Lancers prior to tap-off. “We kept extending it one trip at a time on offense and grinding on defense. We have played too well all year.”

SARASOTA -- Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a public health emergency Sunday after two Florida residents -- one from Manatee County and one from Hillsborough County -- tested "presumptively positive" for coronavirus.
   
 The governor's office did not give details about the cases, but a letter circulating widely under the name of Doctor's Hospital of Sarasota states that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has notified the hospital that a patient has "presumptively tested positive for" coronavirus.
   
 A couple of Sarasota Memorial Hospital doctors told the hospital's administration that they received the letter from Doctor's Hospital about the coronavirus case, but the Herald-Tribune was unable to confirm the letter's authenticity directly with anyone at Doctor's Hospital Sunday.
   
 Sarasota state Sen. Joe Gruters said late Sunday that he spoke with someone at HCA Healthcare, which owns Doctors, and "asked is it real."
   
 "They said 'yes,'" Gruters said.
   
 Asked about the letter Sunday, Monica Yadav, the director of marketing and public relations for Doctor's Hospital, said "there is no information we can provide at this time" and referred calls to the Sarasota County Health Department.
   
 A person with the Health Department's after hours answering service said Sunday evening that the department is currently "not answering any questions on this."
   
 The letter had circulated broadly enough that other health officials in the region were scrambling Sunday to verify its contents.
   
 "We are aware of a letter circulating that references a patient under investigation at Doctors Hospital, but we have no report or positive confirmation from the CDC," said Kim Savage, the public relations manager for Sarasota Memorial Hospital.
   
 Savage added that "a couple of doctors alerted us that they received the letter from (Doctors Hospital), but we have not received confirmation of a positive case from the CDC."
   
 According to the letter, the patient was admitted in late February and remains in the hospital's care, according to the statement, which was printed on Doctors Hospital letterhead.
   
 A presumptive positive case means that the patient has tested positive by a public health laboratory and is pending confirmatory testing at CDC, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   
 The CDC on Friday changed its guidance regarding the coronavirus, specifically the criteria for people under investigation, which led the patient to be tested. Upon recognizing that the patient was a potential coronavirus case, Doctors Hospital immediately activated its protocols, which included immediate isolation, according to the letter.
   
 The hospital said that all potentially exposed individuals have been identified, and that the hospital is working closely with local and state departments of health as well as the CDC to take appropriate precautions.
   
 "Just as we have done with seasonal flu and tuberculosis, we identify and treat infectious diseases while minimizing risk," the letter reads. "By being aware of the very latest recommendations of the CDC, Doctors Hospital of Sarasota was able to identify this patient and pursue testing at the very earliest opportunity."
   
 "Please know that the safety of our patients, colleagues and community is of the utmost concern," the letter said.
   
 Savage said the letter has generated concern in the community.
   
 "We are getting people calling that are worried and we're telling them as far as we're aware there are no cases that we're aware of in our community," she said, adding: "The best thing we can do as a community is stay informed, visit the CDC website daily just like you would for a hurricane, you get guidance every day because the situation is evolving quickly."

After years on the neutral ground at Veterans Memorial Boulevard and Loyola Drive, Kenner's Fire Station 38 will spend the next year sporting a more modest profile — a temporary building behind a Church's Chicken restaurant on Duke Drive.
 Utilities and telecommunications lines were run last month to the new site, which will house up to five firefighters at a time as the new permanent fire station is built on an empty lot next door.
 Crews will build a roof over the driveway to cover the firetrucks, and there are climate-controlled outside storage units for firefighters’ personal items as well as work clothing and gear.
 Fire Chief Terence Morris said the three bedrooms and two bathrooms accommodate the same number of firefighters who would typically have responded to a call in the past, albeit in closer quarters than they’re accustomed to.
 “It has all the features of a regular fire station, just in a smaller space,” Morris said.
 He said the department still has the same number of firefighters assigned to that location — between 15 and 18, which is enough for three shifts. Training exercises can take place at other locations and at a Bridge City training facility.
 Morris said there is a traffic signal pre-emption system in place at Duke Drive and Loyola Drive so trucks can roll quickly when they need to.
 The old Fire Station 38 was demolished over the summer as part of the plan by the state to widen Loyola to provide direct access to the new $1 billion terminal at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport.

There are other benefits, too. County officials believe that decreasing the amount of time someone spends in jail lowers their likelihood of being arrested. In 2018, the year before this program started, 14 percent of these types of defendants were arrested again before their initial case had been resolved. Last year, that rate was 8.8 percent. There are a couple of logical explanations for this. If defendants don't lose their jobs, they have less incentive to commit another crime. Also, because they're spending less time behind bars, they're spending less time around other criminals.

For starters, interested individuals should think about whether they actually have either an account or some other kind of relationship with the purported sender that could result in such a message being sent. For example, if someone gets an email asking for them to update their payment information for their Netflix account when they don't have a Netflix account, that is an obvious give-away that is going to put more people on their guard in an instant. Moving on, interested individuals should give serious thought to whether the purported sender would ever send such a message. Simply put, the government isn't going to ask people for their credit card information, meaning that this as well as similar requests are very suspicious to say the least. Besides this, interested individuals should examine the message through and through to see if there are any errors that cause them to take notice. Sometimes, this could mean spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and other signs that the sender isn't legitimate. Other times, this could be the sender calling the targeted individual by something generic when they should already know their name as well as other personal information, which could raise some eyebrows when done by a business in an era in which personalization is one of the biggest business marketing trends.

There are two great reasons I decided to write a column on this topic. The first is that the combination of good manners, respect for those you work with, and showing appreciation to those who work for you is not only good taste, but it's also good business. The second great reason for me writing this column is that it will make my mother proud. Yes, Mom, all those years ago as a kid I was listening, thank you.
 From a business perspective, good manners, respect for your colleagues, showing appreciation and being good to those working for you each bring its own advantages.
 Good manners to all those you work with, including vendors, peers, your staff, customers and those above you organizationally, help you build a high-quality professional brand of being a team player and someone of character. There is an old expression that gets to the heart of the matter on this topic. It says you get more bees with honey than with vinegar. You should be nice to people because it's the right thing to do, but also feel free to reap the benefits and rewards that common courtesy can help bring.
 Showing respect to the people working with you is also the right thing to do, but, like good manners, in the long run can be much to your advantage, or at least not to your disadvantage.
 Early in my career I worked with a person, we'll call him Joe, who for some reason didn't like the manager of another department within the company. I'll call this manager Steve. Joe, for some reason, seemed to go out of his way to make things difficult for Steve. Joe would commit to do things and then not deliver. He would also speak poorly about Steve in front of other company employees, including people within Steve's group. Apparently, there were other people at the company who liked Steve, because he got promoted and became Joe's new boss. As you can imagine, Joe was quite distressed when he heard about Steve's promotion. Steve, on the other hand, actually liked this arrangement. Joe left the company about six weeks later before securing a new position.
 Lastly, regarding being respectful and showing appreciation to those working for you, it's a small world. Over time, many of the same people seem to reappear over and over again. As the expression goes, friends come and go in your life, but enemies accumulate.
 In this next story, I had a person working for me a few years ago. I thought he did great work, I told him so, and gave him a promotion. Time passed and I went to work for another company. The person I promoted also eventually left the company (I guess it must just not have been the same after I left. Just kidding) and used me as a professional reference. More time passed, he got promoted again at his new company and I decided to become an entrepreneur and started my company, Manager Mechanics. Even more time went by and we bumped into each other at a conference. This person shortly thereafter became a client. The moral of this story is that I was nice to this person because it was the right thing to do and years later it became a professional advantage.
 In closing, I don't mean to say that every act of professional kindness will eventually be returned or that every unscrupulous action will come back to haunt you, but based on the law of large numbers, the more often that you are kind or the more often you are mean will eventually catch up with you. My suggestion to you today is be courteous, be kind and be honest. Not only will it make the world a better place, but it can, over time, prove to be one of your greatest professional assets.
 Until next time, manage well, manage smart, and continue to grow.

 “We accept it upfront and if we have to win away from home, we have to do that. No excuses, just learning moving forward. In Tests, we weren’t able to play the cricket we wanted to,” Kohli said.

At first, we just thought it comical. We washed off the windows and boogied on down the road. What we didn't realize was the insidious nature of the problem. Several times we were able to see other vehicles from a distance, and we noticed that behind the truck/RV was a billowing brown fog of "mud dust". We remarked on it, and assumed (very incorrectly) that it would cover only the outer surfaces of anything being towed. In reality, that muddy fog crept in everywhere that a breeze could blow. Once inside a nook or cranny, the fog settled to mud and then dried into a hard cake of dirt.

“Having another line step up for us, rather than the first line that has been giving us a lot of points,” Cedorchuk added. “That gave the team a ton of confidence and it sparked up the entire team — we were getting pucks to the net pretty good.”
 The Foxboro defensive unit solidified its stance at the blue line, not allowing St. John Paul odd-man rushes or breakaway bids. After a scoreless second period, St. John Paul went on another power play 57 seconds into the third period, but Reager once again proved sturdy, blocking four shots.
 “We knew if we kept them to the outside and we let him (Reager, the senior captain) see the puck, he was going to make the save, which he did,” Cedorchuk added. “He’s just so cool, calm and collected, and he’s really been great for us.”
 Reager preserved that one-goal lead until Foxboro scored twice in the final five minutes of the game. Watts gave the Warriors a two-goal lead at 10:07 as he skated to the right side of the attacking zone and glided in for the score, assisted by Alex Coviello. Watts put the game on ice when he scored an empty- netter with 32 seconds left, with assists coming from Kirk Leach and Ronnie MacLellan.

WASHINGTON — With Elizabeth Warren trying to take her progressivism from the legislative branch to the presidency, the judicial branch has something pertinent to say. On Tuesday, while 14 states hold Democratic primaries, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments concerning a possible constitutional defect in her signature legislative achievement.
 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau deserves voters’ attention because it represents the distilled essence of progressive governance — agencies emancipated from accountability so that experts can work their will. Hence it suggests how a Warren administration would operate without constitutional inhibitions.
 Created in 2010, the CFPB is empowered to “declare,” with little legislative guidance, that certain business practices it dislikes are “abusive.” Congress left this term undefined, so the CFPB can improvise criteria. Unlike most other entities Congress has created since 1789, the peculiarly sovereign CFPB is untethered from congressional control of its funding, which is “determined by the director,” who simply requests money, up to $663 million, from the Federal Reserve. The CFPB’s 2012 budget estimate included $130 million for — this is the entire explanation — “other services.”

While capacity sometimes plays a role in why domestic students living outside Indiana come to IU, their motivations are more nuanced. Unsurprisingly, the second most common state of origin is Illinois. It shares a border with Indiana and has a major population center in the city of Chicago.
 The next most common state is California, followed by New Jersey, Ohio and New York. Michigan, Florida, Texas and Pennsylvania round out the top 10. Relationships are a major factor in why students from those states choose IU.
 “We have a long history of affinity with students from the East Coast,” said Sacha Thieme, assistant vice provost and executive director of admissions.
 Students from that region who want a traditional college experience often look to Big Ten institutions. They’re attracted to the big time athletics programs and beautiful campuses.
 People who graduated and returned to the East Coast talked to their neighbors and coworkers about their experiences. Universities like IU capitalized on this by inviting in those alumni to college fairs in the region and encouraging them to speak with prospective students. This established a pipeline that eventually helped bring in students from other states, such as Florida.
 “Who is moving there?” Thieme said. “People are coming from major urban markets in the upper East Coast and Pennsylvania.”
 The growth in students coming to IU from California is a more recent development. As universities in that state began accepting more out-of-state students, there were fewer spots for California residents and they started looking elsewhere. Just like students from the East Coast, some were drawn to the traditional college feel of Big Ten institutions in the Midwest. And again, IU capitalized on this influx.
 “We saw great growth when we put someone in that market full time,” Thieme said.
 Having someone from IU in an area helps to strengthen relationships with secondary institutions and alumni. Then word spreads.
 Even though IU actively recruits students from outside the state and the country, the university’s flagship campus continues to be a destination for thousands of local residents. Of the students coming to IU from within the state, more come from Monroe County than any of Indiana’s other 91 counties. Hamilton County is next, followed by Marion, Lake and Allen.
 Thieme and Wilkerson both consider the geographic diversity of IU Bloomington’s student body as an essential part of the educational experience the university offers.
 “Being from Indiana, that was pretty special to me,” Thieme said. “You don’t have to travel too far down the road to meet students from all over world and that will continue being the case for our students.”

 There are two great reasons I decided to write a column on this topic. The first is that the combination of good manners, respect for those you work with, and showing appreciation to those who work for you is not only good taste, but it's also good business. The second great reason for me writing this column is that it will make my mother proud. Yes, Mom, all those years ago as a kid I was listening, thank you.
 From a business perspective, good manners, respect for your colleagues, showing appreciation and being good to those working for you each bring its own advantages.
 Good manners to all those you work with, including vendors, peers, your staff, customers and those above you organizationally, help you build a high-quality professional brand of being a team player and someone of character. There is an old expression that gets to the heart of the matter on this topic. It says you get more bees with honey than with vinegar. You should be nice to people because it's the right thing to do, but also feel free to reap the benefits and rewards that common courtesy can help bring.
 Showing respect to the people working with you is also the right thing to do, but, like good manners, in the long run can be much to your advantage, or at least not to your disadvantage.
 Early in my career I worked with a person, we'll call him Joe, who for some reason didn't like the manager of another department within the company. I'll call this manager Steve. Joe, for some reason, seemed to go out of his way to make things difficult for Steve. Joe would commit to do things and then not deliver. He would also speak poorly about Steve in front of other company employees, including people within Steve's group. Apparently, there were other people at the company who liked Steve, because he got promoted and became Joe's new boss. As you can imagine, Joe was quite distressed when he heard about Steve's promotion. Steve, on the other hand, actually liked this arrangement. Joe left the company about six weeks later before securing a new position.
 Lastly, regarding being respectful and showing appreciation to those working for you, it's a small world. Over time, many of the same people seem to reappear over and over again. As the expression goes, friends come and go in your life, but enemies accumulate.
 In this next story, I had a person working for me a few years ago. I thought he did great work, I told him so, and gave him a promotion. Time passed and I went to work for another company.

Even more time went by and we bumped into each other at a conference. This person shortly thereafter became a client. The moral of this story is that I was nice to this person because it was the right thing to do and years later it became a professional advantage.

CANTON — The No. 7-seeded Foxboro High hockey team may have hit the ice as the underdogs to No. 2-seeded St. John Paul II in a Division 3 South quarterfinal game at the Canton Ice House Sunday, but the Warriors proved themselves to be fearless, as senior goalie Espen Reager posted his second straight postseason shutout with 18 saves, and sophomore Jack Watts scored twice in the 3-0 victory.
 In extending its unbeaten streak to 11 games (8-0-3), Foxboro (12-4-5) received its game-winning goal off of the stick of sophomore Matt Grace in the final minute of the first period, while Watts added a pair of third-period tallies, one into an empty net.
 “We really don’t worry about who the other team is,” Foxboro coach Mark Cedorchuk said, even if St. John Paul had merely two losses on the season. “We’re cognizant of the fact of who they’ve played and what their record is, but as long as we keep stressing the things we were doing the whole year and staying with the process, we’ll be okay.”

Media mogul Oprah Winfrey is shrugging off her onstage tumble during her wellness tour stop in Los Angeles, accepting the viral moment is destined to forever be immortalised as a meme.
 The superstar was discussing the importance of balance in life at Saturday's (29Feb20) Oprah's 2020 Vision: Your Life in Focus event when she lost her footing and fell to the ground.
 An aide rushed to help her to her feet as Oprah laughed off the ironic incident, joking to the crowd, "Wrong shoes!", and backstage, the 66 year old insisted being left red-faced wasn't her main concern - it was how she would get back up.
 During a backstage chat with her best pal, newswoman Gayle King, which Oprah later shared on her Instagram Story timeline, she said, "I didn't even think (about how it would be) embarrassing. I just thought, 'OK, I fell, everybody knows what falling is.' You would prefer not to fall. My thing was, 'I'm falling, I can't get up!'"
 And Oprah subsequently acknowledged the fact her loss of balance would be ridiculed for years to come as it was the perfect footage for a meme, but she refused to let it put a damper on her memories of the show.
 "I thought this was a great day in spite of the fall, which now becomes a meme, I know," she shared in a separate video post.
 "I picked myself up. I don't know if there was something on the floor or my foot twisted or what. I had that indication I was gonna fall before, and then, it just is what it is..."
 Oprah also revealed she would be resting her leg for the remainder of the evening.
 After thanking her special guest, Jennifer Lopez, for joining her on the tour stop, she wrote, "Now I'm headed home to ice my knee and ankle..."
 J.Lo wasn't the only celebrity guest at the Los Angeles show - Oprah's famous friends, Rita Wilson and David Oyelowo, were in the audience for the gig, while actress/singer Julianne Hough performed a dance during a break in the programme.

Some precedence suggests that the director, whose five-year term is longer than that of the president, can only be removed by the president “for cause” (for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance”), not for policy reasons. So, if the president and the director disagree about important policies, the director prevails. Does this violate the separation of powers by diminishing the president’s authority to direct executive branch operations?
 The answer: Yes, but. The court has not strictly enforced the “unitary executive theory,” which holds that nothing can constitutionally diminish direct presidential control of all executive branch officials. In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt fired a member of the Federal Trade Commission because the two differed on policy questions. In 1935, the court ruled 9-0 that Roosevelt could not remove the commissioner because the FTC is not “an arm or eye of the executive,” that it must “act with entire impartiality,” enforcing “no policy except the policy of the law.”
 The FTC, however, unlike the CFPB, is run by five commissioners, and no more than three can be from the same party, which is a check against partisan abuses. The CFPB, which is independent in a way that no other agency ever has been, is controlled by one person, the director who can nullify a president’s preferences.
 Ideally, the court will hold that the CFPB’s structure regarding its director — never mind its other gross defects — is unconstitutional. It is generally wholesome to prune presidential power, which has grown in tandem with Congress’ desire to delegate its powers to other institutions. Sometimes this desire is symptomatic of sloth. Other times it is symptomatic of defeatism, acknowledging the impossibility of Congress directing or even monitoring the sprawling administrative state that Congress has created. In this case, however, the court’s protection of presidential power would rebuke Congress for its slapdash construction of a CFPB that fits nowhere in the Constitution’s tripartite design of government.
 This rebuke would underscore what has been a defining characteristic of progressivism ever since Woodrow Wilson first enunciated it, and is a conspicuous facet of the thinking of Elizabeth Warren, the architect of the CFPB. It is hostility to the Madisonian separation of powers, a supposed anachronism that prevents regulatory government from quickly working wonders through unfettered progressives.
