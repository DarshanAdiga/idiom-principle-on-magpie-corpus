Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli will plead guilty to their involvement in the college admissions scandal Friday morning, and you have a front row seat to the latest chapter in the months-long saga. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, neither Loughlin nor Giannulli will physically appear in court, the hearing instead scheduled to take place at 11:30 a.m. ET via Zoom, the video conferencing app that has become all the rage during lockdown. To watch, all you have to do is sign up through the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
 To sing up, first click the link here, which will direct you to a "Request for Courtroom Seating/Remote Access" form. You will be required to enter select information, including your name, the date, and your Zoom display name, as well as telephone number should you wish to only have audio access. Participants will then be sent either a link to join the Zoom video or a number to call in on, depending on whether they selected video or audio access.
 The request form notes that those seeking video access "will be placed into a Zoom waiting room to start" and that "your Zoom display name must read exactly as provided above." Access will not be granted to those whose Zoom display name does not match what they had provided. It also notes that if you are only seeking audio access, "the telephone number you call in on must be the same number you have submitted to us above." It adds that "any individuals who attempt to disrupt the hearing will be removed."
 It is also important to note that photographing, recording, and broadcasting the proceeding is prohibited, "except as specifically provided in these rules or by order of the court." Providing your access information to the video conference to others, whether it be forwarding it or distributing it through other means, is also prohibited.
 During the hearing, Loughlin is expected to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. Meanwhile, Giannulli will plead guilty to enter a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud as well as honest services wire and mail fraud. The guilty pleas are part of a plea deal reached and announced Thursday that will see both Loughlin and her husband serving time behind bars. Their sentences of two and five months prison time, however, are subject to a judge's approval.

London, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 22nd May, 2020 ) :England paceman Chris Woakes is glad to be suffering the "normality" of familiar aches and pains following his first bowling net practice since the coronavirus lockdown.
 Warwickshire's Woakes was back at his Edgbaston home ground in Birmingham on Thursday for an hour-long stint after being chosen for an individual session.
 Batsmen and wicketkeepers are due to return from June 1\.
 The players are seeking to build up their fitness ahead of a three-Test series at home against the West Indies, which looks set to be rescheduled for July behind closed doors.
 "It's what we know, it's what we do," Woakes told a conference call on Friday. "Obviously it's the job, so it was nice to have some form of normality going back to some training." England have selected 18 bowlers to take part in individual training sessions across seven grounds, with just a physiotherapist in attendance.
 Under strict health measures they are not allowed to use changing rooms and must work with a set of balls they alone can pick up.
 "It looks a lot different to what we're used to," said the 31-year-old Woakes, an allrounder and veteran of 33 Tests.
 "But at the same time, with what's everyone's been through, it was quite nice to be out there and do a bit of training and get the ball back in hand," the World Cup-winner added.

Iran said on Friday it had detected another 51 deaths from its novel coronavirus outbreak, bringing the country's overall fatalities to 7,300.
 Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 2,311 new positive tests for COVID-19 took the country's caseload to 131,652.
 Fourteen provinces reported no deaths in the past 24-hour period, while six reported just one fatality.
 Iraj Harirchi, deputy minister of health, renewed an appeal for Iranians to avoid unnecessary travel during the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
 Iranians usually travel between provinces to visit their family and friends during Eid al-Fitr, which will be held on Sunday and Monday in the Islamic republic.
 "Moving in the red zones puts us in danger and moving in the white zones puts the inhabitants of these zones in danger," Harirchi was quoted as saying by Mehr news agency on Friday.
 Iran reported its first cases of coronavirus on February 19 -- two deaths in the Shiite holy city of Qom.
 The government of President Hassan Rouhani was criticised for being slow to react as the virus spread rapidly across the Isamic republic.

A range of aid programmes in war-ravaged Yemen, including ones responding to coronavirus, could be cut in the coming weeks because of funding shortages, the UN warned on Friday.
 The United Nations and Saudi Arabia will host a donor conference on June 2 in a bid to boost support for Yemen, which was already facing the world's worst humanitarian crisis before the pandemic struck.
 "We are urging the donors to pledge generously, and those who have given an indication of pledges to actually pay early because the operation in Yemen is severely, severely underfunded," Jens Laerke, a spokesman with the UN's humanitarian agency OCHA, told a virtual press conference.
 "We are heading towards a fiscal cliff," he warned.
 "If we do not get the money coming in, the programmes that are keeping people alive and that are very much essential to fight back against COVID will have to close."
 Laerke said the UN estimated it needed some $2 billion to keep essential programmes running in Yemen for the remainder of the year.
 He said just $677 million had been donated so far this year, compared with over $4 billion during 2019.
 "Yemen is really on the brink right now. The situation is extremely alarming," Laerke said.
 \- Transmission 'widespread' -
 He said more than 30 key UN programmes were at risk of closing in the coming weeks due to the lack of funding.
 They include the COVID Rapid Response Teams, which had only enough funding to keep going for six more weeks, he said.
 Yemen has officially recorded 184 cases and 30 deaths so far, but medical charity Doctors Without Borders said this week at least 68 virus patients had died at its Aden facility in the first half of May alone -- calling it the "tip of the iceberg".
 Laerke agreed, telling journalists Friday that the UN was "working on the assumption that there is already widespread communal transmission going on".
 He said epidemiologists think the virus could spread faster and with deadlier consequences in the war-torn country.
 \- Saudi involvement 'normal' -
 Yemen's healthcare system has been blighted by years of conflict that has driven millions from their homes.
 The conflict between government forces and the Iran-backed Huthis escalated in March 2015, when a Saudi-led military coalition intervened against the rebels after they overran much of the country.
 The war has left tens of thousands of people dead, most of them civilians, and the UN says around 24 million Yemenis -- more than two thirds of the population -- rely on some form of aid.
 Questions have been raised over Saudi Arabia's involvement in the donor conference, given that it has been accused of war crimes in Yemen.
 Laerke said the UN had voiced concerns "forcefully and vocally" over alleged abuses committed by all sides but stressed that Saudi Arabia was by far the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen in recent years.
 "They gave very large amounts of money. They gave it unconditionally, no strings attached," he said, adding that the billions in Saudi donations had helped fight cholera outbreaks and looming famines.
 Having Saudi Arabia co-host the event "is a normal choice based on that background," he said.

That's why many analysts prefer to use the trailing P/E ratio -- it's simply more objective.

Europe's Six Nations bosses and southern hemisphere rugby chiefs say they are working closely to draw up an "aligned global calendar" for when the sport resumes.
 The two organisations are responsible for the major annual international tournaments, with SANZAAR (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) overseeing the Rugby Championship.
 Coming up with a harmonised schedule of fixtures to align the northern and southern hemisphere calendars as well as ensuring fewer clashes with club fixtures has long proved a tricky task.
 A joint SANZAAR and Six Nations statement issued on Friday said the two organisations had been "working closely over the lockdown period".
 "Even though there may be different preferences, from the outset the nations have adopted a mindset that has sought to eliminate self-interest and recognise that the international and club game have shared mutual benefits," it said.
 Although short on specifics, the statement outlined several principles that were guiding the talks.
 These included "significantly" mitigating overlaps between club and country fixtures, better-aligned player-release windows and improved player welfare.
 With this year's Six Nations still to be completed and the whole July programme of international matches in the southern hemisphere postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the sport faces the prospect of a Test match fixture pile-up later this year.
 But any internationals that take place outside the designated November window could face opposition from England's Premiership and France's Top 14 as they would cut across those competitions.
 The two leagues recently wrote a joint letter to World Rugby urging they be consulted on any new-look fixture list.
 European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR), which runs the European Champions Cup club competition, has made it clear that it intends to stage its delayed showpiece final in October.
 SANZAAR and the Six Nations said they had sought to take on board the interests of the international and club game.
 "A further consultation process, in total transparency with unions, clubs and players, will commence as all parties work towards an aligned global calendar that can deliver a clear and coherent narrative," their statement said.
 The coronavirus-enforced suspension of rugby union has left leading countries, heavily reliant on income from international fixtures, facing major losses.
 Although other sports are returning to training, rugby faces a particular challenge as it is a full-contact sport.
 On Thursday, the English Premiership announced clubs would not be back training for at least two more weeks, meaning some of the remaining nine rounds of matches may have to be scrapped in order to finish the season.

GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) — A car wash worker in North Carolina found treasure amid the business’s trash when he discovered a $1,200 IRS stimulus check mixed in with the garbage. Antonio Hernandez was taking out the trash at the Greenville car wash when he spotted the payment in the can, WITN-TV quoted his daughter, Michelle Alvarado, as saying. Hernandez and Alvarado were able to track down recipient Charles Thompson, who said he was not even expecting to get a check after recently moving to a new address. “I was behind on rent, I work construction so I work by the day, and I just try to keep going and going as best I can,” Thompson told the news station. “That money helped put me ahead and put me on the right track a little bit, to get back on my feet.” Hernandez and Alvarado added that they were happy to help connect Thompson with the lost funds, even though they and Thompson had no idea how the check ended up at the car wash in the first place. “It was very important for him to receive that check, especially in these uncertain times,\" Alvarado said. The IRS has been sending the economic impact payments to millions of Americans around the country as part of a rescue package aimed at combating the economic effects of shutdowns amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli's daughters, Olivia Jade and Bella Giannulli, are "devastated" after their parents agreed to plead guilty to fraud in the college admissions scandal. Although Olivia Jade, 20, and Bella, 21, are said to be relieved that their part of the scandal's saga is coming to an end after a more than year-long legal battle, they are now facing a new struggle: coming to terms with the terms of their parents' plea deal.
 After Loughlin and her husband agreed to plead guilty on Thursday, something that will see them both serve time behind bars, a source told _Us Weekly_ that the girls "were devastated" when their parents "told them they were pleading guilty." Still, after enduring "so many ups and downs" over the past several months as a result of the scandal, "they were happy it was going to be over." The source added that Olivia Jade and Bella, who "been spending a lot of time at their parents' house recently," particularly "fear for their mom going to jail."
 Under the terms of the agreement, announced Thursday by the U.S. Department of Justice of Massachusetts, Loughlin will plead guilty one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. Her husband, meanwhile, will plead guilty to that same charge as well as a charge of honest services wire and mail fraud. Pending court approval, the Full House alum will serve two months in prison, with her husband serving five months. They will both be required to pay a fine ($150,000 in Loughlin's case and $250,000 for Giannulli), serve two years of supervised release, and complete 100 and 250 hours of community service, respectively.
 "Under the plea agreements filed today, these defendants will serve prison terms reflecting their respective roles in a conspiracy to corrupt the college admissions process and which are consistent with prior sentences in this case," United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said of the plea deal. "We will continue to pursue accountability for undermining the integrity of college admissions."
 The plea deal comes after months of the couple denying any wrongdoing in the case, for which they are accused of paying William "Rick" Singer, a consultant at the heart of the widespread scandal, $500,000 to have their daughters admitted into the University of Southern California as crew recruits, despite neither of them having ever participated in the sport. In total, more than 50 people have been charged in connection to the case, dubbed Operation Varsity Blues, with Loughlin and her husband making the 23rd and 24th parents to plead guilty. They are scheduled to enter their pleas to the charges via video conference on Friday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Much of the country remains unlikely to venture out to bars, restaurants, theaters or gyms anytime soon, despite state and local officials across the country increasingly allowing businesses to reopen, according to a new survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.That hesitancy in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak could muffle any recovery from what has been the sharpest and swiftest economic downturn in U.S. history. Just 42% of those who went to concerts, movies, theaters or sporting events at least monthly before the outbreak say they’d do so in the next few weeks if they could. Only about half of those who regularly went to restaurants, exercised at the gym or traveled would feel comfortable doing so again.About a quarter of Americans say someone in their household has lost a job amid that downturn, and about half have lost household income, including layoffs, pay cuts, cut hours or unpaid time off. The majority of those whose household suffered a layoff still believe they will return to their previous employer, but the share expecting their job will not return has risen slightly over the past month, to 30% from 20%.Amber Van Den Berge, a teacher in Indiana, held off on immediately returning to her second job as a fitness instructor. She would need to pass a test for COVID-19, get her temperature checked each morning and lead class while wearing a protective mask.“Wear a mask to teach a fitness class? I’m not ready for that,” said Van Den Berge, 39.The speed and strength of any economic rebound could be thwarted because many fear the risk of new infections. Consumers make up roughly 70% of U.S. economic activity, so anything less than a total recovery in spending would force many companies to permanently close and deepen the financial pain for 39 million people who have lost jobs in the past two months.Forty-nine percent of Americans approve of how President Donald Trump is handling the economy, the poll shows. That has slipped over the last two months, from 56% in March. Still, the issue remains a relative positive for Trump, whose overall approval rating stands at 41%.Trump has at times downplayed the threat of the coronavirus and the benefits of testing and has criticized the leadership of Democratic governors. Meanwhile, many Democratic lawmakers have insisted on the importance of containing the disease and sustaining the economy with federal aid.Greg Yost, a Republican from Rockaway, New Jersey, says he wishes the president would defer more to medical experts, rather than speak off the cuff. But he added that he thinks Trump believes he must defend himself against personal attacks.“He’s between a rock and a hard place,” Yost said.But ShyJuan Clemons, 45, of Merrillville, Indiana, says Trump has made the fallout from the pandemic worse by initially denying its dangers and failing to display much empathy for those hurt by the coronavirus.“Even my cat knows that he’s terrible,” said Clemons, referring to his 14-year-old Siamese mix, Shinji.Clemons works with special needs people and worries about his hours if Indiana -- starved of tax revenues because of the disease -- cuts its budget.But it also shows how an atmosphere of political polarization may be feeding both an eagerness by some to return and a reluctance by others to resume their previous lifestyles.Among those who did so at least monthly before the outbreak, Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to say they’d go to restaurants (69% to 37%), movies, concerts or theaters (68% to 28%), travel (65% to 38%) and go to a gym or fitness studio (61% to 44%).Sixty-nine percent of those who regularly shopped in person for nonessential items before the outbreak, including majorities among both parties, say they’d be likely to wander malls and stores again. But Republicans are more likely to say so than Democrats, 82% to 61%.Yost expressed no qualms about going out because he believes the economic damage from shelter-in-place orders will be worse than the deaths from the disease.“What’s going to happen with depression, homelessness -- a lot of other problems are going to arise because we shut down the economy?” said Yost, a vice president of operations at an insurance agency. “I would go to a restaurant and feel comfortable with my kids and not even have masks on.”Still, there's an exception to the partisan divide, with 76% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats who get haircuts on at least a monthly basis saying they’d do that in the next few weeks if they could.The poll finds an overwhelming majority of Americans, 70%, describe the economy as poor, but their outlook for the future is highly partisan. Sixty-two percent of Republicans expect improvement in the coming year, while 56% of Democrats say it will worsen.At the same time, two-thirds of Americans say their personal finances are good, which has remained steady since before the outbreak began.Many families have been able to survive the downturn because of aid such as direct payments to taxpayers and expanded unemployment benefits that will expire in July.Mitchell Durst, 74, has watched the job losses from the sidelines as a retired mathematician in Keyser, West Virginia.He was already cautious about going out because of a compromised immune system from cancer treatments. The disease stopped his weekly poker game. He lived through the polio crisis, dealt with gas rationing during the 1970s and worked in Nigeria during the Ebola scare.He calculates the United States will need to be patient about an economic comeback.“Until we have a vaccine, particularly for those folks at risk, it’s going to be awhile,” Durst said. “If we get something in two years, if we’re so fortunate to be able to do that, I think that would be fantastic.”___The AP-NORC poll of 1,056 adults was conducted May 14-18 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Stay-at-home orders have been seen as key in slowing the spread, but rely on the false assumption that everyone has access to safe and stable housing. Some people looking for affordable housing placements in March and April found themselves in limbo, with progress on paperwork suddenly stalled. For those with housing, unpaid rent was up 50% in April over March. Many large cities and states have temporarily halted evictions and a federal eviction ban covers about a quarter of rental housing. But this is only for nonpayment, leaving a loophole for landlords to continue pursuing eviction for other reasons. And that one-time stimulus check won't even cover the median monthly rent in a number of states, especially in parts of California and the New York City metro area. So what happens when the check has been spent and the eviction ban is lifted?

Paris, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 22nd May, 2020 ) :The novel coronavirus has killed at least 332,870 people since the outbreak first emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1100 GMT on Friday.
 At least 5,109,290 cases of coronavirus have been registered in 196 countries and territories. Of these, at least 1,913,300 are now considered recovered.
 The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections.
 Many countries are testing only symptomatic or the most serious cases.
 The United States remains the worst-hit country with 94,729 deaths from 1,577,758 cases. At least 298,418 people have been declared recovered.
 After the US, the hardest-hit countries are Britain with 36,042 deaths from 250,908 cases, Italy with 32,486 from 228,006 cases, France at 28,215 deaths and 181,826 cases, and Spain (27,940 and 233,037).

While much has been made of Fox News Channel’s nearly 20 years in the game, and that bit of tumult atop the network last week, another 20-year anniversary in TV news is approaching. “Money Trail,” ABC chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross’s franchise segment dedicated to following the money in politics, debuted at the 1996 GOP convention Aug. 12. For the sixth consecutive presidential election season, Ross and his team are at the party conventions, spotlighting the influence of big money in politics.
 Ross is in Philadelphia, and likely hoping for a livelier time than what he saw last week in Cleveland. “It was, what if you gave a party, and nobody came?” he told _B &C_ July 20, filing a dispatch about the attention wealthy GOP benefactor Sheldon Adelson was attracting in Cleveland. “I’ve been to a lot of these and never has it felt like a party where no one came.”
 He says the idea for “Money Trail” came from Roone Arledge, former ABC News president, and Peter Jennings, former ABC _World News Tonight_ anchor, and the segment has been present at every convention from 1996 until the current ones. “They said, you should go and follow the money,” said Ross of the ABC News icons. “The big donors all want to have special treatment.”
 The GOP’s uneven showing in Cleveland led to what he calls “sort of an unintended campaign finance reform,” while the email hacking scandal hitting the Dems leading into their wingding may dampen the mood there too.
 Yet Ross says there’s generally more money, and more secrecy, than ever in politics. Nixon’s scandalized White House led to a number of reforms, he says, but over the decades those have been peeled back.
 This time around, he says as much as $8 billion in campaign cash may change hands by Election Day. “It’s important to know who gave what,” Ross says, “and what they want in return.”
 The Money Trail appears throughout ABC News, whether it’s on _GMA_ or _World News_ _Tonight_ or ABCNews.com. The trail does not end Nov. 8. “People trying to influence the American government,” Ross said, “is a 24/7 thing for them.”

A Pakistani passenger plane with nearly 100 people on board crashed into a residential area of the southern city of Karachi on Friday.
 The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane was close to landing when it came down among houses, sending plumes of smoke into the air that could be seen from some distance away.
 Rescue workers and local residents pulled people from the debris, as firefighters tried to put out the flames.
 "I heard a big bang and woke up to people calling for the fire brigade," said Karachi resident Mudassar Ali.
 PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez said there were 91 passengers and seven crew on board the flight, which lost contact with air traffic control just after 2.30pm (0930 GMT).
 "It is too early to comment on the cause of the crash," he said.
 Abdul Sattar Khokhar, of the country's aviation authority, said the Airbus A320 was travelling from Lahore to Karachi.
 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was "shocked and saddened" by the crash, tweeting that he was in touch with the state airline's chief executive.
 "Prayers & condolences go to families of the deceased," said Khan.
 Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the plane crashed into a residential area minutes before it was due to land.
 The disaster comes as Pakistanis across the country are preparing to celebrate the end of Ramadan and the beginning of Eid al-Fitr, with many travelling back to their homes in cities and villages.
 The Pakistan military said security forces had been deployed to the area and helicopters were being used to survey the damage and help ongoing rescue operations, while offering condolences over the "loss of precious lives" in the incident.
 Commercial flights resumed only days ago, after planes were grounded during a lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic.
 Pakistan has a chequered military and civilian aviation safety record, with frequent plane and helicopter crashes over the years.
 In 2016, a Pakistan International Airlines plane burst into flames after one of its two turboprop engines failed while flying from the remote north to Islamabad, killing more than 40 people.
 The deadliest air disaster on Pakistani soil was in 2010, when an Airbus A321 operated by private airline Airblue and flying from Karachi crashed into the hills outside Islamabad as it came into land, killing all 152 people on board.
 An official report blamed the accident on a confused captain and a hostile cockpit atmosphere.
 PIA, one of the world's leading airlines until the 1970s, now suffers from a sinking reputation due to frequent cancellations, delays and financial troubles. It has been involved in numerous controversies over the years, including the jailing of a drunk pilot in Britain in 2013.
