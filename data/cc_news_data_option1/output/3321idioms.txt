Monica Arellano, the managing attorney for the Legal Aid Foundation’s program for preventing and ending homelessness, told me of a person who had lost his job just before the pandemic and couldn’t pay his rent. His landlord began the process of evicting him, but couldn’t legally complete it. Now, as he tries to stay free of COVID-19, the landlord enters his rental constantly for random inspections.
 Rob Reed, the directing attorney for homelessness prevention at the Inner City Law Center, told me about a couple with children living in a small rent- stabilized apartment who were in the midst of eviction proceedings when the virus hit. While the mother, who thought she had the virus, tried to self- isolate to keep her family safe, the building’s owner, unable for the time being to legally evict, began insisting on repairs and then sending unmasked workers to do them.
 “You’re stuck at home. You have nowhere to go....There’s a lot of intimidation going on,” Reed told me.
 Matthew G. Clark, a staff attorney who handles employment-related cases for the Legal Aid Foundation, told me of one woman who called in because her boss at a pricey gym told her that she needed to come back to work even though the high-end customers could not be expected to wear masks. Clark advised her she had good cause to refuse to return and collect unemployment benefits.

The main features of the USNCC include conferring transferable and recognized associate-level academic degrees and certifications, providing flexible delivery methods to account for operational demands and technological constraints of a globally distributed workforce, developing academic programs in alignment with the needs of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard as well as recognizing various forms of learning obtained through military technical and leadership training.
 “We are excited about the possibilities that this partnership brings to the college,” Christensen said. “Aside from the fact that this will provide an additional source of student enrollment to SFSC in our online programs, the college is honored to be able to play a role in helping to support and strengthen our country’s armed forces through education. As a retired naval officer, I am thrilled at the opportunity to be able to help our nation’s armed forces take advantage of this wonderful opportunity to enhance their education while they serve our great nation.”
 The first pilot of the USNCC will begin in January 2021 with approximately 500 active duty Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen. The second pilot will start in January 2022 with 5,000 students. For the first year or two, students will be selected to participate in the USNCC as the concept is proven and while the Navy works to win authorization from Congress to continue and grow. Once the USNCC is up and running at scale, open enrollment will be offered to the entire enlisted force. Full-scale operations with up to 25,000 students are expected to start in January 2023.
 For more information on USNCC and SFSC partnership, contact Dean Erik Christensen at erik.christensen@southflorida.edu or 863-784-7424.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - How nice would it be to make it through a whole weekend without rain? Some of us will be able to do that. After 9 out of 12 days with rain in Charlotte, it would be a nice change, right? Today will bring mostly cloudy skies with highs in the mid to upper 80s. It will still be muggy. (We are still in late August.) However, rain chances stand at about 20 percent. That isn’t just for today. Sunday looks much the same. In the week ahead, highs will climb a bit each day. We will go from the upper 80s Monday to the low 90s by midweek. We’ll add on about a degree a day. Rain chances will remain low. There’s only a 10-20 percent chance each afternoon. We are keeping an eye on the tropics. It is unusual to have two tropical storms in the Gulf at one time, but it doesn’t look like anything will directly impact the Carolinas. There are two storm, Laura and Marco. They will likely make landfall along the Gulf coast in the week ahead. The current NHC track takes Marco close to Galveston Tuesday evening as a tropical storm. Laura will move close to New Orleans as a low end hurricane about 24 hours later. Make it a great weekend!Meteorologist Leigh BrockCopyright 2020 WBTV. All rights reserved.

A single mother was taking care of her own mother as well as her four children, one of whom has disabilities. She’d been struggling to make ends meet before her landlord added several hundred dollars to her rent last year. When she couldn’t keep up, the landlord began the eviction process. They reached an agreement to delay that process but then the pandemic hit and left the single mother out of work. She gave the landlord what she could for rent, but the landlord wasn’t satisfied.
 The Inner City Law Center got involved just days before a hearing on the scheduled sheriff’s lockout, said Donella Green, the center’s supervising attorney for homeless prevention. The court allowed the lockout to go forward. Now this family of six is about to lose its housing, just as the kids are starting online school. Their mother will have to try to search for a way to put a roof over their heads as she also works to keep the kids connected so they can learn — when the obvious places to do that, such as public libraries, remain closed.
 Some landlords and employers and domestic abusers, by refusing to hold to safety precautions, essentially have weaponized the coronavirus as a threat.

The objective of the social-democrats in the local elections is to remain the largest political party in Romania, said Marcel Ciolacu on Saturday, after the congress in which he was elected chairman of the Social Democrat Party (PSD), and added that in the case of a weak score, he will be the one to foot the bill.
 "The main objective in the local elections is to have as many local elected officials - because the local elections come first - just as we have now, in other words, to remain, the largest political party in Romania. In what regards footing the bill, that's on me personally and I take it on in full," Ciolacu said, when asked what the objective of the party in the local and parliamentary elections is and who will foot the bill of an eventual weak score in the elections.

 Zunino homered to left field off Luis Avilán in the sixth inning to give the Rays an 8-4 lead. His second homer in as many games elicited audible cheers from the Rays dugout in the empty stadium.

 Yandy Díaz padded the lead in the ninth with a two-run homer, drawing more enthusiasm from the Tampa Bay dugout and more inside the clubhouse once the final out was recorded.
 “We were excited,” Wendle said. “We just won nine out of 10 on the road. We just swept the Yankees in New York. That’s fun stuff.”
