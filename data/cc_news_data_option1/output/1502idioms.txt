With financial impacts ahead, Thurman also said that the board is currently looking into possible grant opportunities to keep its doors open in the future as this year’s play cancelation will result in loss of revenue.
 In the meantime, he said he’s still working every day to keep the facility and theater ready for when things kick back up again. The board is also working on ways it can stay connected with community members and loyal patrons online.
 Backstage director, board member and actor Kim Lavey said she’s been working on ideas to possibly produce some sort of skit later this summer.
 “We could probably do a little something to boost people up at a way reduced price if not just on a donation basis,” said Lavey. “We want to do our part to cheer people up and we can have some fun too.”
 According to Lavey, this year’s play featured about 20 volunteer actors and about 25 Olio dancers. The cast, as well as the hundreds of folks who help contribute to the show each year, were saddened to hear the show was canceled and postponed, said Lavey.
 This is the first time a show has been canceled in the theater’s entire history. In 1994, a fire destroyed the Sawdust Theatre’s building and halted operations only temporarily. The production that year still took place at the Coquille Community Center, said Lavey.
 With help from community members, corporate donors and countless volunteers, the theater was rebuilt to its former glory.
 “We’re a family,” said Lavey. “We all miss each other and we all just miss being able to be down (at the theater.) I appreciate all the people who were a part of our theater family and to everyone who was going help me backstage this summer…
 "We are going to be up and running fully as soon as we’re able to do it.”

The national airline has no information whether or when there will be any flight to repatriate nearly 400 stranded Pakistanis back home in the near future, sources within the airline say. The sources also confirmed that special arrangements were made for the April 09 flight because three family members of a government minister and other "dignitaries" were stranded in London and needed to return at any cost.
 “All the plugs were pulled out and special arrangements were made for that flight to take passengers from the Heathrow Airport in London to Islamabad Airport in Pakistan because family members of a minister and some other dignitaries wanted to leave London on an urgent basis,” said the sources, pleading anonymity. Since then there have been several “ferry” flights to Pakistan from London, but no passengers have been taken by PIA based on the pretext that there are no quarantine arrangements at Pakistani airports at the moment, and PIA staff have asked for better virus protection.
 A PIA source said that around 150 passengers were taken on the April 09 flight, and the remaining seats, after the VIPs had been accommodated, were kept empty to maintain social distancing. A spokesman for the Pakistan High Commission confirmed that it had passed lists of stranded passengers to the PIA. "Only those passengers were added in the list who were recommended by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and PIA’s head office," the spokesman added.
 Two passengers who were able to make it to Pakistan on the same flight confirmed that they were able to get seats after a lot of lobbying which involved recommendations at the ministerial level.
 While well-connected passengers have been able to fly back to Pakistan from the UK, around 400 passengers remain in the country without any support from the Pakistani authorities.
 Many of the Pakistanis stranded in Britain are short-term travellers, and vulnerable people, including the elderly and the sick, and also students whose original flights got cancelled when Pakistan closed its airspace on March 21.
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had initially planned to close the airspace till April 04, but as of the filing of this story, commercial flights have not been allowed to fly to and from Pakistan.
 Passengers whose flights have been cancelled have criticised the government for flying empty flights back to Pakistan from the UK when even a single flight from London would be enough to accommodate all stranded Pakistanis in London.
 Habibur Rehman, a heart patient who is stuck in Stoke, said, “I am running out of my medicine, I have heart problems but the pharmacies here aren’t giving me medicines over the counter. They say they want a prescription but doctors aren’t allowing me to visit the hospital.”
 Mohammad Noman, an elderly businessman from Karachi said, “My wife and I are diabetic and heart patients, we don’t have medical supplies. We contacted Pakistan High Commission multiple times but no help. They took my information but did nothing. PIA has not cooperated, given no information.”
 Noman's son, Burhan, who is extremely upset over his parents’ condition, said, “We are citizens of Pakistan and our own country is not taking us back.”
 Another Karachi resident, who works as a cloth merchant and is stuck in the UK, said, "I'm a blood pressure patient. When my medicine ended, the National Health Service (NHS) gave me one week's supply and said this was all they could provide because I'm a foreigner. I don't know what will happen to my health if I don't get my medicine. The Pakistani government should do everything they can to help me."

In the words of Paul Hawken, the renowned American environmentalist and author, the first rule of sustainability is to align with natural forces or at least not try to defy them. If only the second half of his statement had resonated sufficiently with the masses!
 The scare of Covid-19 has entrusted us with accountability. The lockdown, almost inadvertently, has roused our consciousness about consumption. Suddenly, urban indulgent imps have become unwilling to consume more than what's needed. With basic options at hand and a fickle future ahead, we are always looking to save, preserve, upcycle and innovate. Is sustainability no more a lifestyle choice? Is it now a survival strategy or at least, an exercise we are willing to consider?
 DIY from scratch
 "We are living in unusual times, times we weren't prepared for. And look how we have realised our capacity! The fact that we CAN make do with essentials is being absorbed now," says Rhea Chhabria, eco-preneur, SuckIn. "Currently, you can't order in a cake. Bakeries are shut so, if you want to celebrate with a cake, you have to bake one. As a result, you avoid the extra packaging, nylon ribbons and a plastic knife -- all of which would have gone into the bin the following day," Rhea elaborates. SuckIn produces reusable, lead-free and easy- to-clean stainless steel and bamboo straws. She says the curfew has given her time to think up DIY tricks to work around junk. "A couple of sling bags were lying in my wardrobe for years. Had the malls been open, I would have donated these and bought a new bag," she guiltily admits. Rhea threw in bright colours on her old bags to bring them back in use.
 Make wonders with waste
 Gauri Agarwal, founder, Skilled Samaritan, says values at work are no different from values at home. "Working with underprivileged rural communities in northern India has given me an edge in curtailing waste. Except for the internet and gadgets, social distancing has taken us back to the nineties. We are home and spending time with our families. The contagion and need for sanitisation make us carry personal bottles and boxes to a store. These are habits worth living by," she says. Gauri goes on to explain how the dire situation has made mankind slow down; shops are shut, delivery services are disrupted and we can't buy things out of fancy. We are inculcating a healthy and responsible way of life. "My team of rural women make charpoys with salvaged textile and industrial waste. They weave plastic waste into handbags and seats. Since I am home constantly and want the space to look inviting, I am redoing nooks with old products. Even when the curfew is lifted, people can use plastic containers or paint tubs as planters and grow their own vegetables," Gauri signs off.
 From skin to seed, eat it all
 Have you walked into your kitchen in the recent past and been cautious about using items in the larder? Chef Arina Suchde, a mixologist who practises sustainable cooking, says one must be watchful. "Now, is the time to learn how to use every part of a fruit or vegetable. We can't go out as often and hence, we are required to plan meals that stick to the zero or reduced waste policy. We tend to throw away coriander stems when the non-woody ones can be cleaned, chopped and used in some stock or dimsum sauce; they add a nice flavour. The watermelon is our go-to summer fruit, as it keeps the body hydrated. But what about the white part? The white part mimics the taste of a raw papaya or cucumber and is rich in nutrients. After peeling off the green skin, it can be cut in pieces and cooked or can be grated into salads," she adds. As per Arina, a tenable routine should be put in place even if we are not battling tough times.

ISLAMABAD: Former federal minister and PPP parliamentary leader in the Senate Senator Sherry Rehman Wednesday pointed out five serious complexities about coronavirus and said Parliament's urgent role of scrutinizing government, authorizing spending, making laws, and providing leadership during difficult times must be upheld.
 She urged going forward with making rules and arrangements for an online session as well as the regular session of standing committees.
 "While Pakistan faces a risk of increased cases and casualties, the federal government's decision-making, effectiveness of lockdowns as well as its health and economic policies remain questionable. The need for a consensus on effectively managing this state of emergency is greater than ever. The Senate of Pakistan, while ensuring no province is left behind in the decision-making process, needs to advocate for unity and cohesion to cope with this pandemic in the best interest for the public of Pakistan".
 She offered comments in the wake of House Business Advisory Committee of the Senate.
 "The Senate has to urgently address five big issues related to the Corona crisis. The federal government must look towards coordinating and aligning policies across the board. A coherent strategy among all provinces is the need of the hour to tackle and contain the growing COVID-19 challenge. A provincial government or a city alone cannot stamp out this deadly contagion. Chairman PPP, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, has also called for a unified strategy between the center and all provinces to combat the rising threat of the pandemic. This is the time for national unity where all provinces must be on the same page. As of now, the entire federal response is based on federal point-scoring politics vs Sindh," she added.
 "We need to fight Corona, not each other." Secondly, health infrastructure deficits must be discussed in what we see is a daily evolving situation. Parliamentary committees must not function without data. Even civil society has questions about our capacity to protect the frontline. Discord on numbers, management over testing, provision of protective gear to doctors and health workers, all must be our priority, the Senator added.
 Thirdly, we must face down the challenges our most vulnerable communities face, without exposing them to the life-threatening virus. Like most countries, Pakistan is facing key issues of charting a consensus-based policy which creates a workable balance between protecting lives while managing a lifeline to livelihoods, with huge impacts for the informal sector, daily wage-labour and SMEs. So far, the government has shown a disregard for the federal system by ignoring the views of political parties that run a province. Changing the name of the Benazir Income Support Program into the Ehsaas program has left a bad taste in the mouth of those who advocate maturity.
 The design, delivery and even branding of social protection packages driven by federal and provincial governments, including public philanthropy and state relief in terms of ration-delivery to vulnerable households has raised several issues that should have been directed through parliament.

 ROB Essex is known around the Ipswich Greyhound Racing Club as one of the region’s leading trainers.
 For the second week running, Essex trained a Saturday night double.
 Senorita Maywyn won her fifth grade 520 metre heat in race seven before brother Maywyn Ulysses repeated the dose in race nine.
 Any trainer would be happy with a double. However, the wins were the cherry on top for Essex who saw his pacer Maywyn Courage salute less than an hour earlier at Albion Park, giving him a Saturday night treble over the two codes.
 Essex said the feat was something he wouldn’t forget and he wasn’t taking that for granted knowing the ups and downs of the racing game.
 Although greyhounds are his main focus, he has ownership in 15 pacers and three thoroughbreds.
 Talking about his litter mates who will clash in next week’s fifth grade final, Essex said he would probably give the edge to Maywyn Ulysses as the more talented dog. But he couldn’t have been more impressed the way Senorita Maywyn returned after a couple of months away from the track.
 Essex said Senorita Maywyn had been ticketed for failing to chase two months ago.
 After taking the 28-day ban, they stayed away from the track for an extra month of education and since returning, she is two from two with no bad habits in sight.
 Maywyn Ulysses has had no such problems and recorded win number seven in impressive fashion sitting outside favourite Waddling Witch at the first corner before taking over down the back for a 30.58 win.
 Essex said the main difference between the pair was the back sectional where Ulysses clocked 13.02. Senorita came in a 13.30.
 Essex said if Ulysses could draw inside and avoid trouble at the first corner, he’d be very hard to beat on Saturday night.
 Flying Jet aims high
 LAST week we spoke about Peter O’Reilly’s Group Three Vince Curry finalist Flying Jet winning his Novice in impressive fashion.
 A week later, he got the better of the fifth graders in devastating fashion.
 There aren’t too many better out of the box runners than Flying Jet, who seems to relish being drawn around the middle of the line and being first to the fence.
 He found himself on the second line of betting to a desperately unlucky Velocity Bettina for Kev Ellis who just couldn’t find a run. But even if she did, Flying Jet was off with the prize gapping them early easing home in 30.66.
 It sets up an intriguing fifth grade final next week with Rob Essex’s brother sister duo and up-and-comer Waddling Witch for Jamie Hosking set to make it a good race.
 Proper Gent at best
 THE 2019 Greyhound of the Year Proper Gent is probably looking at 2020 as his final campaign.
 John McCarthy’s 431 metre specialist turned four in February but time didn’t stop him with a win for the ages in open class last Saturday night.
 A clear last out of the boxes wearing the green, the veteran used all his experience to stay off the fence. That give him a wide berth around the first turn to at least give himself a chance of running into the placings with his exceptional second sectional.
 Picking up momentum from out wide, he started to reel them in one-by-one, looming up to fourth at the home turn. Despite covering a tonne of ground, he kept coming to score by half a length for his 28th victory at track and trip.
 With a total of 120 starts for 37 wins and 40 placings, the dog looks like he’s going to end his career on a high, winning or placing in a remarkable 13 straight races.
 Best Fit for Ipswich
 RACE five last Saturday night feature two of Ipswich’s best sprinting prospects go head-to-head. Darren Russell’s Best Fit and Pauline Byers Spring Halo didn’t disappoint.
 Spring Halo was stepping up in grade after an impressive 24.99 performance at start nine.
 Best Fit is proven over the 431-metre trip at Ipswich as well as a 30 second even 520 dog at Albion Park.
 The younger of the two looked be to getting the better of the battle when she took over approaching the home turn but Best Fit’s superior strength kicked in as he came again to win by a neck.
 With plenty of grades for Spring Halo to go through at Ipswich, she is one to watch after back-to-back big runs. Best Fit will step back up to the 520 metre trip.
 Super stayers show
 THE Ipswich club has a rare fourth and fifth grade 630 metre event in race four on Saturday night and well performed dogs at the trip.
 Karen Kleinhans has two engaged with recent Ipswich winner Irinka Tina and Albion Park 600 metre winner Waikarie Bell both suiting up.
 Irinka Tina has won recently at the track and trip but in restricted grade, but couldn’t make the step up to Monday night 600 metre company at Albion Park. If she gets out of the boxes, she’ll give a good sight.
 Kennel mate Waikarie Bell is the opposite being a slow beginner who will be doing her best work late.
 She beat a hot field at Albion Park in Thursday night company three starts ago and if she finds the rail could run over the top of them.
 Breast Cancer Cup champion Federal Elle, for Corey Mutton, is another runner that has to be respected, a proven stayer over the 732 at Ipswich and 710 at Albion.
 If she can gain a prominent position in the run, she won’t be tiring at any stage.

The 44-year-old took control of the Bundesliga strugglers earlier in the week after Mirko Slomka was relieved of his duties with the club bottom after securing only one point from their opening three league matches.
 There was renewed hope around the Imtech Arena after surviving via the relegation play-off last season as the likes of Pierre-Michel Lasogga, Valon Behrami, Johan Djourou and Lewis Holtby arrived.
 However, there has not been a change in fortunes yet and Zinnbauer was called on to step up and replace Slomka after Hamburg's worst start to a Bundesliga season.
 Zinnbauer's first task is working out how to stop champions Bayern and, although he insists the result against Pep Guardiola's side is "irrelevant", he has warned his players that they must produce a good performance or face being replaced.
 "My philosophy on the pitch is to be dominant," he said. "I enjoy being in charge.
 "If things are not working in the first team I will call up players from the reserves and will take no prisoners.
 "We have players in the reserves good enough to play a game at Bundesliga level.
 "The problems lie in the mind. It's about the quality of the team as a whole and not the quality of individuals.
 "We have several hundred top-flight games under our belts, which is why we have to introduce emotion to the equation."
 Hamburg's forwards will be under pressure, given they have yet to find the back of the net in the league this season, but a match against the frugal Bayern defence may see another frustrating afternoon.
 Bayern have started the Bundesliga campaign well with two wins and a draw from the opening three matches and sit second behind early leaders Bayer Leverkusen on goal difference.
 Guardiola's men scored a glut of goals - 12 to be precise - in the three meetings against Hamburg last season in all competitions, while only conceding twice.
 And confidence in the Bayern camp will be high heading into this weekend after Bayern made a successful start to their UEFA Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a 1-0 home win over Manchester City.
 That game saw Mehdi Benatia make his debut following his move from Roma and he is expected to continue alongside Jerome Boateng at the heart of the defence.
 One player who is not guaranteed to be involved, though, is enigmatic winger Franck Ribery after he missed the midweek win through injury.
 The France international made a scoring return in the league last weekend, but he remains a doubt for this trip due to requiring further treatment on a knee problem.

First-half goals from Joel Matip and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting at the Veltins Arena sent Jurgen Klopp's men crashing to a third defeat from the opening six games of the new Bundesliga season.
 The manner in which Matip and Choupo-Moting were allowed to put Schalke two goals to the good inside 23 minutes will give Klopp plenty to ponder, although the Dortmund coach can take some solace from his players' response to a sluggish start.
 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made it 2-1 midway through the first half and Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann was required to make several fine saves to keep last season's runners-up at bay.
 But Dortmund could not find a way past Fahrmann and were left frustrated by another costly domestic defeat.
 Defender Mats Hummels made his first start of the season for Dortmund after proving his fitness following muscular problems, while Shinji Kagawa dropped to the bench.
 Given the rivalry that exists between the two clubs, a feisty opening appeared inevitable and a clash of heads between Choupo-Moting and Lukasz Piszczek inside the opening 30 seconds resulted in the latter requiring treatment off the pitch.
 Aubameyang tested Schalke goalkeeper Fahrmann from 25 yards before Dortmund were left to rue some poor defending at the other end as the home side broke the deadlock after 10 minutes.
 Matip - who was back at the centre of the Schalke defence - slipped away from two markers to meet Dennis Aogo's corner on the six-yard box with a powerful header that gave Roman Weidenfeller no chance.
 Ciro Immobile fired wide after beating the offside trap and cutting in from the right wing as Dortmund attempted to get a foothold in the game.
 But their task became more difficult when Choupo-Moting capitalised on more hesitant defending to make it 2-0 after 23 minutes.
 Weidenfeller showed great reactions to palm away Matip's header from Aogo's cross before Adrian Ramos' attempted clearance eventually fell kindly for Choupo-Moting. He made no mistake with a low drive from 10 yards.
 The Cameroon international striker's third Bundlesliga goal of the season prompted an almost instant response from the visitors as Dortmund pulled one back four minutes before the half-hour mark.
 Ramos surged down the right flank and pulled a pass back that the advancing Aubameyang diverted across Fahrmann from just inside the penalty area.
 Only a fine fingertip save from Fahrmann denied Dortmund an equaliser four minutes into the second half. Immobile pivoted and shot from 20 yards, but Fahrmann was down quickly to his right to palm the low drive wide when at full stretch.
 Kevin-Prince Boateng spurned a decent chance to make it 3-1 by dragging a shot wide before Schalke were again indebted to another Fahrmann save, this time to turn Aubameyang's free-kick behind.
 Dortmund saw claims for a penalty turned down with 23 minutes left when Matip and Ramos came together on the edge of the penalty area, but referee Peter Gagelmann waved play on.
 Substitute Milos Jojic headed wide after 79 minutes as the visitors continued to press forward before Klaas-Jan Huntelaar came agonisingly close to adding a third for Schalke in stoppage time.
 Huntelaar latched on to a lofted ball downfield and turned past Neven Subotic, but his shot struck Weidenfeller's legs and trickled agonisingly wide.
 Victory for Schalke sees them leapfrog Dortmund in the Bundesliga table.

In October last year the Egyptian giants beat the Cameroonians on penalties in the semi-finals of the continent's premier club competition, the CAF Champions League.
 Vengeance will not be easy, though. Al Ahly will be filled with confidence after they beat arch-rivals Zamalek on penalties to claim their eighth Egypt Super Cup on Sunday.
 The Cairo giants will also be keen to add to their 19 international club trophies, which has seen them being officially recognised by CAF this year as the most decorated club in the world.
 With both AC Milan and Boca Juniors on 18 international club trophies, the addition of the CAF Confederations Cup this year should be enough to keep them on top for at least another season.
 Coton Sport will be confident in their own right. They top the Cameroon Elite One league having won their last five matches in a row and also qualified for the Cameroon Cup finals after beating Etoa Meki last Thursday.
 In the other semi-final first leg, Sewe Sport welcome the Democratic Republic of Congo's AC Leopards to the Stade Municipal in San-Pedro having never made this stage of a CAF competition before.
 That didn't stop club chairman Eugene Diomande declaring: "Our ambition is to qualify for the final and win it."
 He has the right to be bullish about his team's prospects as they have not lost at home in their last six matches and will still be buoyed by their superb 3-0 win over Nkana to secure their place in the final four.
 AC Leopards will be no pushovers though. They know what it takes to go all the way having already etched their name onto the Confederation Cup trophy when they won it in 2012 after beating Djoliba AC 4-3 on aggregate.
 The Congolese side have a habit of scoring four goals when they need to in this competition, after they beat ASEC Mimosas of Ivory Coast 4-1 to qualify for the semis and in the matchday five beat the other semi-finalists Coton Sport 4-0.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — More than 100,000 Virginians filed unemployment claims in the past week, new data released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Labor shows. It’s a significant drop from the nearly 150,000 from a week before but still a massive number compared to filings before the coronavirus outbreak. Overall there have been more than 415,000 claims filed in the last month, which is about 9% of the state’s workforce. The new figures come amid growing unhappiness from Republican lawmakers and others with Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's plans to keep non-essential businesses closed through May 8. Some Republican leaders have urged Northam to release a schedule to allow businesses to reopen as soon as possible and a few dozen people gathered peacefully near the governor’s mansion in Richmond on Thursday afternoon to protest closures and social distancing measures. “Hundreds of thousands of Virginians are hurting right now. They’re scared, and they need something to hold on to ... They need to know that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, that this nightmare is going to end,” House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert and other House Republicans said in a statement. Others said many Virginia businesses will not survive an indefinite closure. Nicole Riley, the Virginia director of the National Federation of Independent Business, said her members understand the need for caution but also require advance notice on when they can start operating again. “We need a date and we need a date certain,” she said. Outside the Executive Mansion Thursday, some protesters sat quietly on chairs or picnic blankets while others held signs, and one pocket of demonstrators chanted, “End the lockdown.

 Regardless of what happens, Hellebuyck said his approach and comfort level heading into 2019-20 made the difference after the Jets fell in six games to the St. Louis Blues, who would go onto win the Stanley Cup, in the first round last spring.
 "I was ready to prove myself," he said. "I had a little more experience ... things were falling into place. I had the right mindset, the right coaches around me. And the guys were playing great in front of me, too.
 "I was able to identify my game pretty easily at an early stage of this year and it just helped grow it."
 Hellebuyck, who's spending this era of social distancing and self-isolation at home in Michigan with his girlfriend and brother, is thankful to hear his name mentioned in end-of-season-awards talk.
 But he's only got one thing in mind whenever the games resume.
 "It would be a great milestone and it would definitely be one of my goals achieved," he said. "But at the end of the day, what I truthfully want is the Stanley Cup."

New coach Roger Schmidt has implemented attacking tactics since his arrival from Salzburg and seen 22 goals scored in six competitive outings.
 Sunday's thrilling 3-3 draw against Werder Bremen ended a run of five consecutive wins and arguably showcased both the pros and cons of Schmidt's ambitious set-up.
 Bundesliga leaders Leverkusen endured an indifferent time in last season's Champions League, with a 5-0 group-stage loss to Manchester United followed by a 6-1 aggregate defeat at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16.
 But Calhanoglu insists they are focused on inflicting similar misery of Monaco, who have endured a torrid, winless start to their Ligue 1 campaign on the back of James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao's high profile departures.
 "We will attack them right from the off," Calhanoglu, a close-season signing from Hamburg, told UEFA.com ahead of Tuesday night's Group C opener in the principality.
 However, Schmidt sounded a note of caution - dismissing the importance of Monaco's second-bottom standing at domestic level.
 "We are confident and the players know it. We have analysed Monaco's game and they are a good team," he said.
 "They have not played in Europe for a while but they are not outsiders. It is only early in the season, the standings do not mean anything."

ISLAMABAD: The International Sports Press Association, London, has criticised the detention of Jang/Geo Group Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman by the NAtional Accountability Bureau (NAB) and termed it as part of political victimisation
 Protesting over the detention, Member of the Executive Committee of the International Sports Press Association and Secretary General Asian Sports Journalists Federation, Amjad Aziz Malik has said Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman is the Editor-in-Chief of Jang Group; the largest media house of Pakistan. He is facing a case registered by NAB against him according to which he has been allegedly involved in illegally acquiring a plot of land from Lahore Development Authority about 34 years back. Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, being a law abiding citizen of the motherland, has surrendered himself to the law enforcement agency.
 Although he, like a common citizen, was fully ready to cooperate with NAB, he was arrested. He has now been in prison for 33 days. It seems that Mir Shakil- ur-Rahman is targeted to suffer political victimisation. This could be because of the vocal and critical stance of the respective media houses on the policies of the government. The government is also judged to be intolerant when it comes to the critical analyses of its actions and deeds by concerned media groups.
 That is why, firstly, the aforementioned newspapers were deprived of their due share in the government's paid advertisement releases and then their chief executive was arrested. However, the newspapers did not budge from their principles and have continuously maintained their critical reporting and analyses in respect to the government policies with sanctity of freedom of expression.
 The reason for putting a veteran journalist behind bars is now an open secret. It is the common practice world over that the arrest of any law abiding citizen ends up in the initiation of court proceedings in the respective country. However, when law of the land is overruled, it is the law in itself succumbing to be killed.

Dortmund make the trip to the Veltins Arena facing a four-point gap to leaders Bayern Munich, having suffered a loss to Mainz in their last game on the road and a draw in the subsequent home match against Stuttgart.
 Jurgen Klopp's squad has been beset by injuries and Dortmund are yet to keep a clean sheet in the league this season, something that defender Mats Hummels is eager to address.
 "We need more stability in defence," said Hummels, who is set to return from a spell on the sidelines against Schalke. "We have already conceded nine goals in five matches which is a very poor record.
 "We need to defend better as a team and all 11 players have to play their part. If you concede two goals in each game, as has already happened four times this season, it's very hard to win."
 Schalke won 3-0 at Werder Bremen on Tuesday to move out of the relegation zone and will be determined to make it three without a win for their rivals, against whom they have won two and drawn one of their last four clashes.
 "It's the biggest derby in Germany," said Schalke coach Jens Keller, who will be without suspended playmaker Julian Draxler. "My players need no motivation."
 Champions Bayern Munich head to Cologne still boasting an unbeaten record, but meet a side who have conceded just once in five games - though their two goals scored highlights a pressing problem.
 With Mario Gotze, Thomas Muller and Robert Lewandowski starring, Bayern returned to form with a 4-0 thumping of Paderborn on Tuesday, which sent them one point clear of Bayer Leverkusen and Hannover at the summit.
 Cologne, on the other hand, have failed to win – or score in – three straight matches, and Bayern's last visit to the RheinEnergieStadion resulted in Muller-inspired 4-1 win.
 Elsewhere, Leverkusen and Hannover are away to lowly Freiburg and Stuttgart respectively.
 Hoffenheim visit Mainz in a scrap between fourth and fifth in Friday's match - a win for either would take them top - while the following day sixth-placed Borussia Monchengladbach travel to a Paderborn side one spot beneath them and Wolfsburg entertain Werder Bremen in a battle of teams in the bottom half.

She urged going forward with making rules and arrangements for an online session as well as the regular session of standing committees.
 "While Pakistan faces a risk of increased cases and casualties, the federal government's decision-making, effectiveness of lockdowns as well as its health and economic policies remain questionable. The need for a consensus on effectively managing this state of emergency is greater than ever. The Senate of Pakistan, while ensuring no province is left behind in the decision-making process, needs to advocate for unity and cohesion to cope with this pandemic in the best interest for the public of Pakistan".
 She offered comments in the wake of House Business Advisory Committee of the Senate.
 “The Senate has to urgently address five big issues related to the Corona crisis. The federal government must look towards coordinating and aligning policies across the board. A coherent strategy among all provinces is the need of the hour to tackle and contain the growing COVID-19 challenge. A provincial government or a city alone cannot stamp out this deadly contagion. Chairman PPP, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, has also called for a unified strategy between the center and all provinces to combat the rising threat of the pandemic. This is the time for national unity where all provinces must be on the same page. As of now, the entire federal response is based on federal point-scoring politics vs Sindh,” she added.
 "We need to fight Corona, not each other." Secondly, health infrastructure deficits must be discussed in what we see is a daily evolving situation. Parliamentary committees must not function without data. Even civil society has questions about our capacity to protect the frontline. Discord on numbers, management over testing, provision of protective gear to doctors and health workers, all must be our priority, the Senator added.
 Thirdly, we must face down the challenges our most vulnerable communities face, without exposing them to the life-threatening virus. Like most countries, Pakistan is facing key issues of charting a consensus-based policy which creates a workable balance between protecting lives while managing a lifeline to livelihoods, with huge impacts for the informal sector, daily wage-labour and SMEs. So far, the government has shown a disregard for the federal system by ignoring the views of political parties that run a province. Changing the name of the Benazir Income Support Program into the Ehsaas program has left a bad taste in the mouth of those who advocate maturity.
 The design, delivery and even branding of social protection packages driven by federal and provincial governments, including public philanthropy and state relief in terms of ration-delivery to vulnerable households has raised several issues that should have been directed through parliament.

WASHINGTON (AP) — With a key coronavirus rescue fund exhausted, lawmakers faced new pressure Thursday to break a stalemate over President Donald Trump's $250 billion emergency request to replenish the program that helps small businesses keep workers on their payroll.
 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are in talks about legislation to shore up a paycheck subsidy program. The Small Business Administration announced Thursday it has reached its $349 billion lending limit and is no longer accepting applications, and Trump immediately weighed in on Twitter to bash Democrats.
 "Democrats are blocking additional funding for the popular Paycheck Protection Program. They are killing American small businesses. Stop playing politics Dems! Support Refilling PPP NOW – it is out of funds!"" Trump wrote.
 House and Senate Democratic aides expected another round of talks Thursday by phone with Treasury officials about Democratic demands for additional money for hospitals and state and local governments.
 The outlook for the legislation is unclear, and negotiators are unlikely to meet a potential deadline of a vote during Thursday afternoon's pro forma session. The session, Democrats say, will not feature a GOP attempt to pass Trump's request — or to shame Democrats were they to object.
 The Capitol is largely shuttered, requiring consensus from all sides for any legislation to pass, and top GOP leaders are vowing to stick closely to Trump's request despite Democrats' additional demands. Long-standing feuds and rivalries hang over the talks, including a toxic relationship between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Trump.
 But the unprecedented legislative environment gives Democrats considerable influence, even if their funding requests for hospitals and state and local governments may have to be scaled back significantly or dropped, at least for now. Democrats blocked a fast-track bid to pass the funding last week, and Republicans in turn stymied their efforts for additional funding for other priorities in a brief debate that was mostly a messaging exercise.
 Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a joint statement Wednesday night with top House Republican Kevin McCarthy of California urging quick funding for the payroll protection program. The Senate is away from Washington through May 4, though it convenes twice each week for pro forma sessions that could be used to pass more coronavirus aid — though only if no senator objects.
 Republicans amped up the pressure for a "clean" extension of the paycheck program in statements Wednesday night. House GOP Whip Steve Scalise said Democrats "need to stop holding small businesses and workers across America hostage to their endless spending demands."
 "Our nation is not the same as it was a month ago," McCarthy said in a call with reporters on Thursday. "This isn't a time to play politics; there's plenty of time to play politics."
 With leaders unable to readily summon lawmakers to Washington, the usual power dynamics are scrambled, especially in the House. There, Minority Leader McCarthy, for example, can stymie legislation more easily than if members are present, and Pelosi, D-Calif., cannot rule the House with her typical tight grip.
 At issue is a $350 billion paycheck protection program that's a centerpiece of last month's $2.2 trillion rescue bill. The program gives grants to businesses with fewer than 500 workers so that they can maintain payroll and pay rent while shutting down their businesses during social distancing edicts.
 The program,has been swamped by businesses applying for loans, and has reached its appropriations limit. Mnuchin says an additional $250 billion is needed immediately.
 But Democrats want money for hospitals burdened under COVID-19 caseloads and additional funding for states and local governments straining as the economy slides into recession.
 They also want to make sure the paycheck protection program is opened up more to businesses that don't have established relationships with banks that have been accepting applications for rescue funding.
 Pelosi is pressing to add money to be distributed by community development financial institutions, which are small, nontraditional lenders that focus on making loans in underdeveloped and underserved neighborhoods, typically communities with larger minority populations.
 "We want to make sure that as it gets more money, many more people get access to the credit," Pelosi said.
 Eventually, the need for consensus seems likely to result in a relatively limited package.
 "It's a matter of adding money to things they've already done so long as the amounts aren't out of whack with reality," said Hazen Marshall, a former GOP leadership aide who lobbies Congress. "They can probably thread this needle if they can just keep it to money."
 Republicans are increasingly agitating to help rural hospitals, while Democrats are also keen to boost aid to cash-strapped states and local governments whose revenues have cratered. Aiding the states may be a stretch for now, however, as the issue can easily provoke fights between large, high- tax states like California and New York and smaller states more typically run by Republicans.
 Senate Democrats are already eyeing the next coronavirus bill, proposing that it include $30 billion for a comprehensive federal plan to ramp up testing and its supply chain for diagnostic materials, as well as the ability to trace the spread of COVID-19.
 Greater access to testing is a key element to have in place in order to reopen the economy, as Trump is itching to do. The proposal envisions emergency money to quickly scale up testing and develop a pipeline to ensure an adequate supply of material.

All these development might pave the way for debt rescheduling for Pakistan over next two years as Islamabad is desperately looking for any such facility in order to create much-needed fiscal space for increasing spending on neglected health sector of the country. The unemployment as projected all multilateral lenders as well by the independent economists will increase putting pressures on budgetary side to jack up the funding for social safety nets.
 The G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to a time-bound suspension of debt service payments for the poorest countries, stated in the communique following their virtual meeting, said, all bilateral official creditors will participate in this initiative," they stated.
 The initiative will "provide north of $20 billion of immediate liquidity" for poor countries to use "for their health system and support their people facing COVID-19.
 In a joint statement by World Bank Group President David Malpass and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on outcome of G20 Finance Ministers’ meeting stated, “We strongly welcome the decision of the G20 to respond to our call to allow the poorest countries of the world that request forbearance to suspend repayment of official bilateral credit on May 1. This is a powerful, fast-acting initiative that will do much to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of millions of the most vulnerable people. The World Bank Group and IMF will move quickly to respond to the G20’s request for us to support this action by working closely with these countries in ways that make the best use of this vital lifeline. We championed this debt initiative, and we're committed to taking all possible steps to support the poor.”

 (Reuters) - The European Commission will delay some climate policies under its signature "Green Deal" proposal due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the timeline to unveil a new 2030 emissions target is unchanged, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.
 The pandemic and economic shock have forced the EU executive to review its plans for 2020, as the novel coronavirus demands an urgent focus on ensuring an economic recovery at a time when most of the EU executive's staff are under lockdown at home.
 Initiatives including plans to protect biodiversity and reforms to make farming more sustainable, due to be unveiled on April 29, could be delayed until later in 2020.
 The sustainable agriculture plan may need to be reworked if the Commission changes its proposal for the next multi-year, 2021-2027 EU budget in light of the pandemic, the draft said.
 Reforms to make the transport and chemicals sectors more sustainable could also be pushed back to later this year.
 Meanwhile, plans to help the bloc adapt to the impact of climate change, improve sustainable forest management, and give consumers better information on recycling and repairing products, are pushed back to 2021, the document said.
 "The Commission is currently reviewing its 2020 work programme due to the outbreak of the coronavirus. We are planning on presenting an updated work programme in the following weeks," a Commission spokeswoman said.
 However, a draft of the revised workplan says the EU executive's most urgent climate policies will not be delayed.
 These include a plan to propose a new, more ambitious EU 2030 climate target in September.
 The target revision is a "pivotal element" of EU climate policy, the draft said.
 The EU was under pressure to unveil a new 2030 target in time for a U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, which was scheduled for November but has been delayed to 2021.
 The Commission needs to encourage bigger EU emissions cuts over the next decade to put the bloc on track for its "Green Deal" vision that by 2050, EU countries will emit no more greenhouse gases than can be absorbed.
 An EU sustainable finance strategy, due after the European summer break, will also not be delayed, the draft said, adding that the policy could help ensure the EU's post-crisis recovery plan aligns with climate aims.
 "This action plan ... is very important for orienting the private flow of money towards a sustainable recovery," it said.
 A group of 180 European politicians, companies and campaigners on Tuesday urged Brussels to use green investments to restart growth after the pandemic.
 The Commission says its Green Deal remains a high priority despite the pandemic, but some EU lawmakers expressed concern at the planned delays.
 "The right to repair (broken electrical goods), the switch to climate-friendly mobility and the Europe-wide energy transition are being jeopardised," German Green lawmaker Michael Bloss said.

Mumbai airport handled 707 tonnes of export cargo and 286 tonnes of imports in a single day on Wednesday, the highest ever at the airport.
 Despite transport constraints and stringent regulations due to COVID-19, the team at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) has kept the cargo terminal operational round the clock, officials said. The airport had recorded an import record of 270 tonnes last week, they said.
 Since March 23, Mumbai airport air cargo has exported 5,200 tonnes of medicines, medical equipment, vaccines, diagnostic reagents, dangerous goods, engineering goods and chemicals, while 3,324 tonnes of freight was imported. Imports have included high volumes of commodities such as pharmaceuticals, dangerous goods, engineering goods and chemicals.
 “CSMIA air cargo has traded a total of 3,788 tonnes of pharma products within India and globally, as the airport holds the first rank for pharma cargo operations in the country,” a Mumbai International Airport Ltd. (MIAL) spokesperson said.
 On an average, Mumbai airport witnesses eight to nine cargo flights per day with export flights operating mainly to the U.S., Germany, South Africa, France and the United Kingdom. Scheduled freighters and ad hoc cargo charters have continued to remain operational during the lockdown.
 “The cargo operations continue to work tirelessly, with skeletal staff, to process the export-import cargo movements. In coordination with the Mumbai Police and BEST, special passes have been issued, and transportation has been arranged for facilitating staff commute to the airport," the MIAL spokesperson said.
 The spokesperson said CSMIA was providing masks to staff. Regular sanitisation and disinfecting the cargo facility, daily briefing on social distancing and safety precautions along with addressing medical emergencies are some of the initiatives being implemented at the airport and cargo complex.

The national airline has no information whether or when there will be any flight to repatriate nearly 400 stranded Pakistanis back home in the near future, sources within the airline say. The sources also confirmed that special arrangements were made for the April 09 flight because three family members of a government minister and other "dignitaries" were stranded in London and needed to return at all costs.
 “All the plugs were pulled out and special arrangements were made for thatflight to take passengers from the Heathrow Airport in London to Islamabad Airport in Pakistan because family members of a minister and some other dignitaries wanted to leave London on an urgent basis,” said the sources, pleading anonymity.
 Since then there have been several “ferry” flights to Pakistan from London, but no passengers have been taken by PIA based on the pretext that there are no quarantine arrangements at Pakistani airports at the moment, and PIA staff have asked for better virus protection.
 A PIA source said that around 150 passengers were taken on the April 09 flight, and the remaining seats, after the VIPs had been accommodated, were kept empty to maintain social distancing.
 A spokesman for the Pakistan High Commission confirmed that it had passed lists of stranded passengers to the PIA. “Only those passengers were added in the list who were recommended by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and PIA’s head office,” the spokesman added.
 Two passengers who were able to make it to Pakistan on the same flight confirmed that they were able to get seats after a lot of lobbying which involved recommendations at the ministerial level. While well-connected passengers have been able to fly back to Pakistan from the UK, around 400 passengers remain in the country without any support from the Pakistani authorities.
 Many of the Pakistanis stranded in Britain are short-term travellers, and vulnerable people, including the elderly and the sick, and also students whose original flights got cancelled when Pakistan closed its airspace on March 21.
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had initially planned to close the airspace till April 04, but as of the filing of this story, commercial flights have not been allowed to fly to and from Pakistan.
 Passengers whose flights have been cancelled have criticised the government for flying empty flights back to Pakistan from the UK when even a single flight from London would be enough to accommodate all stranded Pakistanis in London.
 Habibur Rehman, a heart patient who is stuck in Stoke, said, “I am running out of my medicine, I have heart problems but the pharmacies here aren’t giving me medicines over the counter. They say they want a prescription but doctors aren’t allowing me to visit the hospital.”
 Mohammad Noman, an elderly businessman from Karachi said, “My wife and I are diabetic and heart patients, we don’t have medical supplies. We contacted Pakistan High Commission multiple times but no help. They took my information but did nothing. PIA has not cooperated, given no information.”
 Noman’s son, Burhan, who is extremely upset over his parents’ condition, said, “We are citizens of Pakistan and our own country is not taking us back.”
 Another Karachi resident, who works as a cloth merchant and is stuck in the UK, said, “I’m a blood pressure patient. When my medicine ended, the National Health Service (NHS) gave me one week’s supply and said this was all they could provide because I’m a foreigner. I don’t know what will happen to my health if I don’t get my medicine. The Pakistani government should do everything they can to help me.”

ISLAMABAD: The International Sports Press Association, London, has criticised the detention of Jang/Geo Group Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and termed it as part of political victimisation
 Protesting over the detention, Member of the Executive Committee of the International Sports Press Association and Secretary General Asian Sports Journalists Federation, Amjad Aziz Malik has said Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman is the Editor-in-Chief of Jang Group; the largest media house of Pakistan. He is facing a case registered by NAB against him according to which he has been allegedly involved in illegally acquiring a plot of land from Lahore Development Authority about 34 years back. Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, being a law abiding citizen of the motherland, has surrendered himself to the law enforcement agency.
 Although he, like a common citizen, was fully ready to cooperate with NAB, he was arrested. He has now been in prison for 33 days. It seems that Mir Shakil- ur-Rahman is targeted to suffer political victimisation. This could be because of the vocal and critical stance of the respective media houses on the policies of the government. The government is also judged to be intolerant when it comes to the critical analyses of its actions and deeds by concerned media groups.
 That is why, firstly, the aforementioned newspapers were deprived of their due share in the government's paid advertisement releases and then their chief executive was arrested. However, the newspapers did not budge from their principles and have continuously maintained their critical reporting and analyses in respect to the government policies with sanctity of freedom of expression. The reason for putting a veteran journalist behind bars is now an open secret. It is the common practice world over that the arrest of any law abiding citizen ends up in the initiation of court proceedings in the respective country. However, when law of the land is overruled, it is the law in itself succumbing to be killed.

Neil Adams' side controlled their game on Tuesday, but were wasteful in attack and that came back to haunt them when Johnnie Jackson scored the only goal of the contest in the 86th minute.
 Jackson's strike condemned Norwich to a first home defeat of the season against a side who now sit just two points behind them in a table that sees the top eight separated by only three points.
 One of the sides in that group is Watford, who drew level at the top with Norwich by beating Brentford 2-1 in Billy McKinlay's first match at the helm.
 The Scot took the reins after Oscar Garcia was forced to stand down with health problems, leaving Watford under the guidance of their third different boss this campaign.
 Odion Ighalo poked home on the rebound after his first-half penalty had been saved to give the hosts the lead at Vicarage Road, but Jonathan Douglas wiped out the deficit after the break.
 It fell to Matej Vydra to settle matters with a stunning finish from outside the box after 70 minutes, though Daniel Pudil's second booking in stoppage time did leave Watford with some late defending to do.
 Nottingham Forest spurned the chance to go top as they were held to a goalless draw for the third league game running against Wigan Athletic.
 Luciano Becchio's fortuitous goal helped Rotherham United to a 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers, with goalkeeper Jason Steele's attempted clearance bouncing off the Norwich loanee and into the net.
 That followed Kari Arnason's early opener as the hosts wrapped up the three points before the break.
 Rock-bottom Blackpool claimed a much-needed point with a 1-1 draw at Middlesbrough, while Derby County climbed to fourth with two late goals to beat Bournemouth 2-0 after the visitors had goalkeeper Lee Camp sent off against one of his former clubs.
 Elsehwere, Birmingham City won 3-1 at Millwall, Ipswich Town came from behind to earn a 1-1 draw at Sheffield Wednesday, and Cardiff City caretaker bosses Scott Young and Danny Gabbidon oversaw the same scoreline at Brighton and Hove Albion.

In March 2008, the Federal Reserve (Fed) stepped in to broker what amounted to a bailout of sorts in the demise of Bear Stearns. JP Morgan, the only allowed bidder, won, or shall we stole Bear Stearns for $2 per share. After some heat from the media, JP Morgan was strong-armed by the Fed to pay $10 per share, partially rescuing equity shareholders and bondholders. As part of the agreement with the Fed to raise the stakes to $10 per share, the U.S. taxpayers assumed most of the residual credit risk of Bear Stearns, leaving JP Morgan with virtually no additional risk as a result of the purchase whatsoever. Bear Stearns real estate holdings alone were worth well in excess of the $10 per share price, not to mention many other valuable assets.

LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Jehangir Khan Tareen has ruled out differences with PTI Chairman Imran Khan.
 "I am Imran Khan's stalwart and have no differences with him, the impression that I have developed differences with my party and am meeting leadership of any other party is totally wrong," said Tareen while talking to The News on Wednesday.
 The PTI leader, while denying the rumours of his meeting with opposition leader in National Assembly and PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif, said his commitment is with Imran Khan and he has not met any leader from the opposition side.
 This is noteworthy that recently, the name of Tareen and Khusro Bakhtiyar echoed in the sugar scandal after which the news pertaining todifferences of Tareen with the PM started coming to surface. However, Tareen till date denies developing any differences with Imran.
 Sources revealed that most of the PTI leaders in Punjab seem unhappy with the performance of their own party government headed by Chief Minister Usman Buzdar.
 Since the day one, the PTI government in Punjab has been under criticism over the issue of governance and influence of bureaucracy in the CM Secretariat due to which many ministers have expressed dismay before the party leadership. Most of the senior PTI leaders in Punjab want a strong figure to call the shots in the province which could not only save the party from criticism over its governance but also save it from split. Very recently, Abdul Aleem Khan has taken oath as Food minister in Punjab after a gap of over a year and PTI circles see it as an important development.

"
 We've all been lamenting the loss of the spring sports schedule due to the pandemic.
 Of course, we know there are bigger priorities in the world right now than the absence of sports. That goes without saying.
 But at the same time, sports fans are all trying to find ways to cope without live ballgames and activities.
 Sometimes we'll watch classic games, or in my case, watch the NFL RedZone channel's daily showings of last season's slate of games each week. Or on Facebook, we'll come across the memories signifying anniversaries of sporting events from a year ago to even 10 years ago.
 A high school softball mom the other day on Facebook posted a memory of her daughter showing off a home run ball she hit from a couple years ago. The mom added she can't wait for another season.
 I suddenly had a thought racing in my mind. So I replied to her with that thought. She agreed that it was a splendid idea.
 So here's that thought, and maybe you think it's crazy or maybe you think it's not:
 What if we can petition the Arkansas Activities Association to play the canceled spring sports schedule this fall, and just for this fall, to go along with the regular spring sports schedule for the coming school year?
 Provided, of course, that things return to normal by then.
 I know that it would be great for those underclassmen that barely or even hardly got to play any sports this spring to get some practice and playing time, not to mention experience, under their belts before resuming regular play in the spring.
 It can give schools a chance to regain some revenue that has been lost this spring with no games going on.
 And it can help the athletes instead of having to wait several more months to play spring sports. Plus, it can give their families and their friends the chance to see them play which they weren't able to for most of the spring.
 In Oklahoma, fast-pitch softball is played in the fall and high schools that don't play football have fall baseball, instead. And colleges and universities play soccer in the fall. So spring sports in the fall isn't necessarily a foreign concept around these parts.
 Of course, there may be some obstacles with this proposal.
 You won't have the full rosters for spring sports in the fall that you normally have in the spring. Especially when it comes to football. A baseball player who also plays football is going to generally pick the latter sport in the fall.
 And the fall sports schedule in Arkansas is busy enough as it is with football, not to mention volleyball, cross country, tennis and golf. Several administrators and coaches could potentially be stretched thin even more should spring sports be added to the fall schedule.
 Naturally, there's that chance media members like yours truly could also be frazzled by the time the holidays roll around, covering and keeping up with a vast array of sports during one typical week in the fall. But after getting an unexpected extended break from covering sports, I know for sure I would accept that challenge.
 Then of course there would be the logistics of trying to schedule a bunch of different sports at once. Maybe that could be alleviated by staggering the start of the different sports. Say, start baseball and softball in early August, track in October and soccer in November and December.
 And those seasons may not necessarily have to be too long, maybe a few weeks for each. And maybe not even schedule a postseason; that's really optional.
 But this way, it would be kind of making up for time that has been lost due to the shutdown.
 Maybe this idea still sounds crazy and far-fetched to you. But I bet there might be a lot of athletes, families, fans and coaches who could be on board with this proposal for the fall.
 So to paraphrase the late, great former Chicago Cubs legend Ernie Banks, for the next school year, let's play two (spring sports schedules).
 That is if it's OK to return to the world we once knew before the past several weeks unfolded.

Two fourteen year old girls, Sally Chapman and Barbara Perry, also had the misfortune to have a run-in with the Owlman in 1976. At around 10.00 p.m., while camping in the woods of Mawnan, and as they sat outside of their tent making a pot of tea, the pair heard a strange hissing noise. On looking around, they saw the infernal Owlman staring in their direction from a distance of about sixty feet. Sally said: "It was like a big owl with pointed ears, as big as a man. _The eyes were red and glowing_. At first I thought that it was someone dressed-up, playing a joke, trying to scare us. I laughed at it. We both did. Then it went up in the air and we both screamed. When it went up you could see its feet!"

Leverkusen had the chance to return to the top of the league on Sunday with a win after Bayern were held to a goalless draw by Hamburg and Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund were defeated by his former club Mainz on Saturday.
 But Giulio Donati's sending off after just seven minutes forced Roger Schmidt's side to play at a man disadvantage for much of the match.
 That clumsy challenge also afforded Ricardo Rodriguez the opportunity to put the hosts in front from the spot, which he duly accepted, adding to the goal he scored in Thursday's 4-1 UEFA Europa League loss to Everton, when he also netted at the wrong end.
 Josip Drmic pulled Leverkusen level in the 29th minute to cap a fine breakaway move. But Vieirinha's headed goal, following strong work down the left-hand side from Sebastian Jung, re-established the lead in the final moments of the first half.
 Schmidt shuffled his pack with a double substitution at half-time but eventually the extra man told as Rodriguez was left alone on the edge of the box at a 63rd-minute corner and took full advantage, crashing in a terrific left-foot volley.
 Substitute Aaron Hunt then profited from more lazy Leverkusen defending late on to add a fourth and ensure the slips of last season's top two escaped greater penalty.
 The Bundesliga's other game on Sunday saw Rhineland rivals Borussia Monchengladbach and Cologne clash for the first time since April 2012.
 Cologne's relegation meant these fierce rivals, and their fans, had been denied what is considered one of German football's biggest derbies for more than two years.
 But the action on the pitch failed to match the excitement among the fans as the teams played out a 0-0 draw to remain next to each other in mid-table, each with six points from four matches.

Yes. So I mean we did see – we have seen a declining trend. It came – it came down during Q1. We thought that was the bottom. It took a small notch down, further, actually. So a level I haven’t seen before with $12 per kilo. And now we believe that is truly the rock bottom. But more importantly, I think, is to consider that one thing is what the raw material impact is and where it is, but it takes some time before it translate into our top line. And exactly forecasting what the impact will be is due to the dynamics in the industry and all that. And that’s where we can see a more negative impact from that also. But it is the lowest price point I’ve seen in my 13 years in Hansen for carmine. So I really do believe that this must be the bottom, and prices will, over time, normalize to a more stable, reliable level.

Real are six points behind fierce rivals Barcelona after two defeats in their opening four matches, a run of results that has prompted criticism from the club's supporters, although Ancelotti's men thrashed Deportivo La Coruna 8-2 on Saturday.
 Karim Benzema was singled out by a section of the home fans in their UEFA Champions League win over Basel last week and Iker Casillas has also been targeted.
 And Ancelotti - who faces injury worries ahead of the visit of Elche with central defensive duo Pepe and Sergio Ramos both doubtful - wants a positive approach to Tuesday's game - on and off the pitch.
 "Unity is the most important thing," he said. "The club, the players and the fans must all be united.
 "Our attack is much better right now, we just need to improve our defensive play. I think we are better than last year.
 "Pepe hasn't recovered yet and we will see if Ramos is okay [on Tuesday].
 "He has a problem with his foot, but should recover quickly."
 Two games in the space of four days means Ancelotti will change his side, but Cristiano Ronaldo - fresh from his hat-trick against Deportivo - will definitely feature.
 "I will rotate some players," he added.
 "Cristiano doesn't need a rest [though], we need him now because he is at his best.
 "I always pick the best line-up so the team wins."

After an uproar over its new testing policy excluding asymptomatic people, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in a U-turn has decided to test asymptomatic, high-risk contacts after the fifth day of quarantine. Labs that violate the new rule will face action.
 On April 12, the BMC decided to prioritise testing to reduce the burden on its labs. However, it sparked outrage with India already under fire over its poor testing rate. On Wednesday, the BMC held a meeting to revise its policy after the city reported a drop in new COVID-19 cases and deaths, which was seen as an effect of reduced testing.
 Asymptomatic people will now have to be tested between the fifth and 14th day of quarantine as per norms of the Indian Council of Medical Research. The revised guidelines state: “High-risk contacts may be tested on the fifth day after careful observation. High-risk contacts with co-morbidities should be admitted as per guidelines issued for isolation/admission. If symptoms develop in quarantined asymptomatic people, they will be tested within the 14-day period.”
 A majority of COVID-19 patients in Mumbai are asymptomatic and those who were admitted to hospitals are being moved to quarantine facilities. Patients who live in multi-storeyed buildings and can set aside a room with an attached toilet will be allowed to be in home quarantine; others will be placed in institutional quarantine facilities.
 According to the new circular, healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients but are asymptomatic will now be tested. If they are high-risk contacts, women pregnant up to 34 weeks, patients undergoing dialysis and chemotherapy will be tested even if they are asymptomatic. If they aren’t high-risk contasts, they will be screened before dialysis/chemotherapy /C-section.
 ## Risk of false negative
 The BMC said all asymptomatic people will be tested after the seventh day. It said, “If asymptomatic people are tested within seven days, there is a chance that the results might be ‘false negative’ when they may actually be positive. That is why, asymptomatic people will be quarantined and tested after the seventh day.”
 If asymptomatic high-risk contacts do not have symptoms within 14 days, they will still be tested on the 14th day as per the new norms.
 BMC has claimed to have the highest testing rate in the country. By April 13, the civic body had conducted 27,397 tests or 12.59% of the country’s total tests.

The move follows weeks of Trump’s escalating attacks on the UN health organization as he has sought to deflect scrutiny of his own administration's slow response to the outbreak.
 The US contributes more than any other country to WHO, at more than $400 million per year. Cutting off funds to the group, which has a $4.8 billion annual budget, will be a major blow to the organization as it conducts vaccine trials, distributes test kits and advises governments around the world. "With the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America’s generosity has been put to the best use possible," Trump said during his nightly press briefing.
 Trump accused the WHO of “severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus” and called its opposition to US travel restrictions on China in the outbreak’s early months “disastrous.”
 While the WHO did call such travel bans “ineffective in most situations” at the time, the group did acknowledge that they could buy countries time to "to initiate and implement effective preparedness measures.”
 Trump ended Tuesday's night briefing without allowing his health care advisers to take any questions, in a break with usual practice.
 Trump announced Tuesday that the United States would halt payments to the UN body that amounted to $400 million last year.
 He said it would be frozen pending a review into the WHO´s role in "severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus."
 He accused the Geneva-based body of putting "political correctness above life- saving measures."
 Trump charged that the outbreak could have been contained "with very little death" if the WHO had accurately assessed the situation in China, where the disease broke out late last year.
 Trump’s US decision to freeze funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) triggered anger and concern on Wednesday.
 Reacting to President Trump’s step, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said, "(It is) not the time to reduce the resources for the operations of the World Health Organization or any other humanitarian organization in the fight against the virus."
 "It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world´s efforts to win the war against COVID-19," he said.
 "China is seriously concerned about the US announcement to suspend funding for the World Health Organization," said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian.
 "The current global epidemic situation is grim. It is at a critical moment. This US decision will weaken WHO´s capacities and undermine the international cooperation against the epidemic."
 "We urge the United States to earnestly fulfill their responsibilities and obligations, and support the WHO-led international action against the epidemic," Zhao said, adding that the agency plays an "irreplaceable role" against the pandemic.
 "Deeply regret US decision to suspend funding to WHO," said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Twitter.
 "There is no reason justifying this move at a moment when their efforts are needed more than ever to help contain and mitigate the coronavirus pandemic.
 "Only by joining forces we can overcome this crisis that knows no borders."
 "Blaming others won´t help. The virus knows no borders" -- German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Twitter.
 "One of the best investments is to strengthen the UN, above all the under- financed WHO... in the development and distribution of tests and vaccines.”
 "Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds. Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever," said Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on Twitter.
 "The last thing we need now is to attack the WHO," said former WHO director- general Gro Harlem Brundtland in a statement to AFP.
 "This means weakening our central global institution," said the 71-year-old doctor and former Norwegian prime minister who headed the WHO between 1997 and 2003.
 "We see yesterday´s announcement by Washington on freezing funding of the WHO as most concerning," deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told state news agency TASS.
 "It is a sign of the very selfish approach of the US authorities to what is happening in the world due to the pandemic," he added.
 "Such a blow to this organisation just when the international community is looking towards it... is a step worthy of condemnation and every reproach," the diplomat said.
 He said Russia is urging the US to "cease further attacks on the WHO and take a responsible course."
 Earlier Wednesday, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Trump´s move showed that his main priority was to name and shame the "guilty" and show his own supposed moral superiority.
 "For politicians of this country, there is always someone to blame. In the pandemic, it is China and the WHO," she told TASS.
 Germany slammed Wednesday the US decision to suspend payments to the WHO, as Angela Merkel´s spokesman underlined the country´s commitment to international cooperation.
 "Blaming others won´t help. The virus knows no borders," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas wrote on Twitter.
 "One of the best investments is to strengthen the UN, above all the under- financed WHO... in the development and distribution of tests and vaccines."
 Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert, meanwhile, said the WHO was doing "unbelievably important work".
 "The government is convinced of the need to support and sufficiently finance the WHO," he added.
 Iran said Wednesday the world was learning that the United States "kills people", after President Donald Trump suspended US funding for the WHO amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 Iran´s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif likened the funding freeze to Washington´s "maximum pressure" campaign against his country.
 "The shameful defunding of WHO amid a pandemic will live in infamy," Zarif wrote on Twitter.
 "The world is learning what Iran has known & experienced all along," he said.
 "US regime´s bullying, threatening & vainglorious blathering isn´t just an addiction: it kills people."
 Meanwhile, a team of robot-designing girls in Afghanistan is trying to build a low-cost ventilator from car parts, as health authorities look to boost critical-care capabilities for coronavirus patients in the impoverished country.
 If the teenagers succeed and can get government approval for their prototype, they say it could be replicated for as little as $300, where normally ventilators sell for around $30,000.
 "The team is working with local health specialists, as well as experts from Harvard University, to produce the prototype based on a design by Massachusetts Institute of Technology," said Roya Mahboob, who runs an Afghan tech company and sponsors the team of five girls, aged 14-17.
 They are part of a bigger group of high-achieving high school girls known as the "Afghan Dreamers", from the western city of Herat.
 Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Wednesday called for coronavirus cooperation in talks with a top Chinese official, signaling a bid to keep a lid on renewing tensions.
 President Donald Trump´s administration has berated China for not sharing data more quickly and said Tuesday it was freezing funds to the World Health Organization for not challenging Beijing.
 Pompeo renewed his push for "full transparency" in a call Wednesday with senior Chinese official Yang Jiechi, but the State Department´s tone was unusually positive.
 Pompeo "noted the aid the American people delivered to the people of China in January -- and continue to offer -- and the high importance we attach to China´s facilitation of medical supply exports to meet critical demand in the United States," the State Department said.
 "The two sides confirmed their commitment to defeat the COVID-19 outbreak and restore global health and prosperity," it said. — Agencies

 The last few days I've fluctuated between fear, anger and calm.
 I'm angry -- angry that there are people in charge who didn't do their jobs.
 Angry that things have gotten to this point, that steps weren't taken to protect so many.
 I'm angry because there still aren't proper protocols in place, the right equipment, or procedures.
 I'm angry because people did not take this seriously, and some still think it's a hoax.
 I am filled with fear as I've come to realize so many things are out of my control. I can do everything right and things will still go wrong.
 I can follow all the guidelines, all the rules, but still have thing go terribly awry.
 My fear engulfs me at times because I don't know what tomorrow will bring. I don't know if we will remain healthy. I don't know how to protect my family.
 I am scared.
 I'm not an overly religious person, but find calm in prayer.
 I pray that we will all be okay.
 I've come to live not just day by day, but hour to hour.
 I wake up and tell myself that today I am healthy, so today is a good day.
 I try to live and adapt to this new normal.
 I lean on my faith -- faith that I have sometimes buried.
 I realize now things like how my kids perform in their sports, receiving a bad meal at a restaurant, having someone gossip about me, being left out of social gatherings, the mortgage, politics ... none of that matters.
 None of it.
 All that matters is the moment I'm in. This moment, right now.
 That's all that is certain.
 Nothing is guaranteed. Nothing. If I learn anything from this crisis, it is that.
 If you are healthy, it is a precious gift.
 If you are lucky enough to have your family, your children with you ... embrace it.
 If you are lucky enough to still have a job, be grateful.
 If you have food, a roof over your head and people you love, realize how blessed you are.
 Have compassion for those who are less fortunate. Pray for those who are sick. Pray for those who don't know what tomorrow will bring.

LONDON: Since April 09, the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has not taken any passengers -- stranded in Britain because of the coronavirus pandemic -- back to Pakistan. The April 09 flight had flown family members of a federal minister from London to Islamabad.
 The national airline has no information whether or when there will be any flight to repatriate nearly 400 stranded Pakistanis back home in the near future, sources within the airline say. The sources also confirmed that special arrangements were made for the April 09 flight because three family members of a government minister and other "dignitaries" were stranded in London and needed to return at all costs.
 "All the plugs were pulled out and special arrangements were made for thatflight to take passengers from the Heathrow Airport in London to Islamabad Airport in Pakistan because family members of a minister and some other dignitaries wanted to leave London on an urgent basis," said the sources, pleading anonymity.
 Since then there have been several "ferry" flights to Pakistan from London, but no passengers have been taken by PIA based on the pretext that there are no quarantine arrangements at Pakistani airports at the moment, and PIA staff have asked for better virus protection.
 A PIA source said that around 150 passengers were taken on the April 09 flight, and the remaining seats, after the VIPs had been accommodated, were kept empty to maintain social distancing.
 A spokesman for the Pakistan High Commission confirmed that it had passed lists of stranded passengers to the PIA. "Only those passengers were added in the list who were recommended by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and PIA's head office," the spokesman added.
 Two passengers who were able to make it to Pakistan on the same flight confirmed that they were able to get seats after a lot of lobbying which involved recommendations at the ministerial level. While well-connected passengers have been able to fly back to Pakistan from the UK, around 400 passengers remain in the country without any support from the Pakistani authorities.
 Many of the Pakistanis stranded in Britain are short-term travellers, and vulnerable people, including the elderly and the sick, and also students whose original flights got cancelled when Pakistan closed its airspace on March 21.
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had initially planned to close the airspace till April 04, but as of the filing of this story, commercial flights have not been allowed to fly to and from Pakistan.
 Passengers whose flights have been cancelled have criticised the government for flying empty flights back to Pakistan from the UK when even a single flight from London would be enough to accommodate all stranded Pakistanis in London.
 Habibur Rehman, a heart patient who is stuck in Stoke, said, "I am running out of my medicine, I have heart problems but the pharmacies here aren't giving me medicines over the counter. They say they want a prescription but doctors aren't allowing me to visit the hospital."
 Mohammad Noman, an elderly businessman from Karachi said, "My wife and I are diabetic and heart patients, we don't have medical supplies. We contacted Pakistan High Commission multiple times but no help. They took my information but did nothing. PIA has not cooperated, given no information."
 Noman's son, Burhan, who is extremely upset over his parents' condition, said, "We are citizens of Pakistan and our own country is not taking us back."
 Another Karachi resident, who works as a cloth merchant and is stuck in the UK, said, "I'm a blood pressure patient. When my medicine ended, the National Health Service (NHS) gave me one week's supply and said this was all they could provide because I'm a foreigner. I don't know what will happen to my health if I don't get my medicine. The Pakistani government should do everything they can to help me."

ISLAMABAD: After publicly making commitment by Group of 20 countries to suspend debt servicing payment for poorest counties facing pandemic COVID-19 Virus, the IMF and World Bank announced to support this action.
 All these development might pave the way for debt rescheduling for Pakistan over next two years as Islamabad is desperately looking for any such facility in order to create much-needed fiscal space for increasing spending on neglected health sector of the country. The unemployment as projected all multilateral lenders as well by the independent economists will increase putting pressures on budgetary side to jack up the funding for social safety nets.
 The G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to a time-bound suspension of debt service payments for the poorest countries, stated in the communique following their virtual meeting, said, all bilateral official creditors will participate in this initiative," they stated.
 The initiative will "provide north of $20 billion of immediate liquidity" for poor countries to use "for their health system and support their people facing COVID-19.
 In a joint statement by World Bank Group President David Malpass and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on outcome of G20 Finance Ministers' meeting stated, "We strongly welcome the decision of the G20 to respond to our call to allow the poorest countries of the world that request forbearance to suspend repayment of official bilateral credit on May 1. This is a powerful, fast-acting initiative that will do much to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of millions of the most vulnerable people. The World Bank Group and IMF will move quickly to respond to the G20's request for us to support this action by working closely with these countries in ways that make the best use of this vital lifeline. We championed this debt initiative, and we're committed to taking all possible steps to support the poor."

University of Minnesota experts said Thursday that with $20 million in state funding they could soon begin testing up to 10,000 people per day for the coronavirus and another 10,000 per day for the presence of antibodies that indicate they have recovered from COVID-19.
 That could provide a huge boost to Minnesota’s efforts to slowly reopen the economy. Gov. Tim Walz said Wednesday that Minnesota would need a drastic increase in COVID-19 testing in the next three weeks in order to begin safely restarting business sectors.
 Researchers unveiled their testing effort Thursday, along with the legislative funding request.
 University scientists started out from scratch to build tests that don’t suffer from supply shortages plaguing current testing, said Tim Schacker, vice dean for research at the U’s medical school. Unlike other new tests on the market, he added, the U method works.
 Medical school researchers say they hope to be able to test as many as 300,000 people a month to accurately gauge the extent of the outbreak and focus on keeping health care workers safe. More widespread testing could follow.
 The proposal comes as testing has faltered in Minnesota and across the nation, falling on a daily basis by about a quarter for local diagnostic tests, compared to last week.
 Walz said another test received by state officials recently had only enough materials for 120 tests, and that he expected the federal government would not offer any further assistance on testing.
 “We think we need to be doing about 35,000 tests a week, to start getting the saturation,” Gov. Tim Walz said Wednesday, speaking about testing shortages. He said widespread testing, to identify who may be even temporarily able to safely return to work, is a key to his plan to start easing economic and travel restrictions.
 The University of Minnesota first announced its serological test on Tuesday and said it would use it first at the M Health Fairview Bethesda hospital, to determine the potential exposure of health care workers at the system’s first facility dedicated to COVID care.
 The university unveiled its diagnostic molecular test at the end of March, using its own laboratory-developed procedure that wasn’t as constrained by worldwide lab chemical shortages as other tests. The U said at the time that it was limited to only a few dozen tests per day.
 But the U said this week that molecular testing capacity had grown to more than 300 per day.
 “Our goal is to get something that can be done at a much higher throughput and with supplies that are more widely available, so that we can look at testing the very large numbers you’re talking about when you start screening the whole state,” said a statement about the tests from Dr. Sophia Yohe, medical director of the molecular diagnostics lab at M Health Fairview.

No, we did not see a loss of market share. Obviously, different customers can grow at different pace in a given quarter. And bear in mind that the shelf life of infant formula products is also two, three years. So it's not necessarily that a hoarding in February will hit our financial numbers in Q2, ending end of February in China. So I would be caution not to overinterpret it. One segment in one geography in one quarter based on this. We are not seeing a loss of market share. And actually, infant formula is one of the examples where we have continued to see wins with customers even during this period.

Some local vehicle dealerships continue to adjust to the ongoing presence of COVID-19, refusing to let the new virus extinguish their wishes to meet and please customers.
   
 Among those becoming even more "customer-focused" are the staff members at Randall Ford Inc. at 5500 Rogers Ave., said business owner Bradford Randall. At this location, employees wear cloth masks and use state-of-the-art, ultraviolet-light equipment on vehicles to help keep customers and workers healthy, safe and happy, he said.
   
 "We're using ultraviolet-light equipment to neutralize any threats of germs," Randall said. "The equipment utilizes a high-powered black light, and it goes over things such as the vehicle's radio buttons, door handles, the gearshift -- all of things that you would touch -- as well as the headliner, too.
   
 "The UV light will sanitize those areas; it takes 30 seconds to kill germs," he added. "When we do the UV cleaning, we put a hand tag in the vehicle to show that it's been UV light treated, and that shows customers that the car is clean. It also shows the mechanics that there's no threat to them, as well."
   
 Randall said his company got the idea for using the UV equipment from Best Western Plus.
   
 "Best Western Plus found out that customers wouldn't return if they thought the place was unclean," he said. "We saw that as a great idea, and we have been using this equipment for over a month now."
   
 Randall Ford also is employing the one-entrance plan to encourage social distancing, and each visitor receives a non-invasive scan of his or her temperature. Each customer also is asked a few questions to make sure "everything is safe and good," Randall said.
   
 "Our sales have remained steady, and we're offering free pickup and delivery for all services for vehicles," he said. "For test drives, we can come to the customers. You can get financing and extra warranties online, and we deliver the vehicle to your driveway with an iPad."
   
 Randall Ford also is offering complimentary maintenance with UV light treatment for senior citizens, with free pickup and delivery, Randall said.
   
 "We're doing this because senior citizens have suffered the most, with them not being able to get out and about," he said. "We're looking at offering this complimentary service for them for at least until the end of the month."
   
 For Michael Dawson, owner/operator of Broadway Motors at 809 Broadway Street in Van Buren, COVID-19 has forced a few changes during work hours. He said he's thankful he has yet to "drastically" reduce his business hours, but added that other things have changed.
   
 "I'm keeping customers outside as much as possible, and I'm keeping everything clean with Lysol and wiping things down when people leave," Dawson said. "I have noticed that people are keeping their distance."
   
 Dawson then laughed.
   
 "I've always been a big hand-shaker; that's just who I am," he said. "So, yeah, I'm having a hard time getting used to social distancing."
   
 Sales at Broadway Motors have decreased since much of the public went into self-quarantine mode, Dawson said.
   
 "For the most part, we're getting foot traffic still," he said. "People aren't working, so when they're not self-quarantined, they get out and kick the tires a little.
   
 "But I'd say sales are down about 40%," Dawson added. "I usually average five vehicles a week, but two weeks ago, I sold three vehicles. Last week, I sold three vehicles."
   
 An increase in online traffic, due to people being laid off and/or self- quarantined, also has become a new norm at Randall Ford in Fort Smith, said Peter Rossum, an internet manager for Randall Ford in Fort Smith. Although Randall Ford has experienced more online lookers recently, not all of that browsing resulted in sales, he said.
   
 "People have the option where we can do most of the deals online and through emails, phone calls and text messages," Rossum said. "I sold a pre-owned truck and delivered it to Chester, and I was in a mask and gloves.
   
 "We sanitized the vehicle and brought it to them," he added. "If more people continue to be locked up at home, I think we'll see more of this."
   
 Randall said it's been mostly easy for him to remain optimistic over the last few weeks.
   
 "The business has changed for the better, I think us, because of us being more customer-centric and more customer-focused," he said. "That's a win-win for everyone.
   
 "Our Ford factories will resume production, beginning with a shift at the end of May," Randall added. "It won't be full production, but I think that in the next 60 days, we hope that things will get back to being more normal."
   
 Dawson predicted that life will return to a more normal state in late May or June.
   
 "I think some things will be more expensive when that happens," he said. "But I'm not a big worrier, so we're just trucking along here. I'm appreciating the deals that I've been blessed with -- I've got two sales happening today -- so that's really good."
   
 Like Randall and Dawson, Rossum believes most or all of today's uncertainty and anxiety centered around COVID-19 will one day disappear.
   
 "For me personally, COVID-19 is always in the back of my mind," Rossum said. "I'm not as worried about me being infected as I am worried about possibly infecting others -- senior citizens and my family members who are older. I definitely don't want to be the one who causes someone else to become sick or worse."

In the words of Paul Hawken, the renowned American environmentalist and author, the first rule of sustainability is to align with natural forces or at least not try to defy them. If only the second half of his statement had resonated sufficiently with the masses!The scare of Covid-19 has entrusted us with accountability. The lockdown, almost inadvertently, has roused our consciousness about consumption. Suddenly, urban indulgent imps have become unwilling to consume more than what's needed. With basic options at hand and a fickle future ahead, we are always looking to save, preserve, upcycle and innovate. Is sustainability no more a lifestyle choice? Is it now a survival strategy or at least, an exercise we are willing to consider? DIY from scratch"We are living in unusual times, times we weren't prepared for. And look how we have realised our capacity! The fact that we CAN make do with essentials is being absorbed now," says Rhea Chhabria, eco-preneur, SuckIn. "Currently, you can't order in a cake. Bakeries are shut so, if you want to celebrate with a cake, you have to bake one. As a result, you avoid the extra packaging, nylon ribbons and a plastic knife -- all of which would have gone into the bin the following day," Rhea elaborates. SuckIn produces reusable, lead-free and easy-to-clean stainless steel and bamboo straws. She says the curfew has given her time to think up DIY tricks to work around junk. "A couple of sling bags were lying in my wardrobe for years. Had the malls been open, I would have donated these and bought a new bag," she guiltily admits. Rhea threw in bright colours on her old bags to bring them back in use.Make wonders with wasteGauri Agarwal, founder, Skilled Samaritan, says values at work are no different from values at home. "Working with underprivileged rural communities in northern India has given me an edge in curtailing waste. Except for the internet and gadgets, social distancing has taken us back to the nineties. We are home and spending time with our families. The contagion and need for sanitisation make us carry personal bottles and boxes to a store. These are habits worth living by," she says. Gauri goes on to explain how the dire situation has made mankind slow down; shops are shut, delivery services are disrupted and we can't buy things out of fancy. We are inculcating a healthy and responsible way of life. "My team of rural women make charpoys with salvaged textile and industrial waste. They weave plastic waste into handbags and seats. Since I am home constantly and want the space to look inviting, I am redoing nooks with old products. Even when the curfew is lifted, people can use plastic containers or paint tubs as planters and grow their own vegetables," Gauri signs off.From skin to seed, eat it allHave you walked into your kitchen in the recent past and been cautious about using items in the larder? Chef Arina Suchde, a mixologist who practises sustainable cooking, says one must be watchful. "Now, is the time to learn how to use every part of a fruit or vegetable. We can't go out as often and hence, we are required to plan meals that stick to the zero or reduced waste policy. We tend to throw away coriander stems when the non-woody ones can be cleaned, chopped and used in some stock or dimsum sauce; they add a nice flavour. The watermelon is our go-to summer fruit, as it keeps the body hydrated. But what about the white part? The white part mimics the taste of a raw papaya or cucumber and is rich in nutrients. After peeling off the green skin, it can be cut in pieces and cooked or can be grated into salads," she adds. As per Arina, a tenable routine should be put in place even if we are not battling tough times.

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Wednesday said that the Pakistani expatriates are already facing difficulties due to COVID-19 and asking them to donate in the prime minister's coronavirus fund is totally inappropriate and injustice to them. “Asking for donation from Pakistanis living abroad is shameful. Pakistan should have instructed its embassies to help Pakistanis abroad but instead they have been asked to donate,” said the PPP Deputy Information Secretary Palwasha Khan in a statement on Wednesday She accused Prime Minister Imran Khan and his ministers of making joke of a serious situation. “Special Assistant to PM on Information Firdous Ashiq Awan addresses three press conferences a day in three outfits. Her talking about poor is nothing but crocodile tears,” she said. Palwasha said that PTI ministers are inciting population against lockdown and playing with the lives of people. “The PTI second grade leader Haleem Adil Shaikh is using a tweet of Faisal Edhi against Sindh government, whereas the said tweet was about Punjab, not about Sindh,” she said. Palwasha said the PTI government is hiding the number of COVID-19 patients like it did in the PTI funding case.

 According to ISPR, the 250 bedded prefabricated state of the art hospital would be used to treat not only coronavirus infected patients under best available equipment and medication but also be available for treatment of other infectious diseases.
 Construction work on the project is in full swing and would be completed within 35 days. The construction teams of FWO are working round the clock, ensuring proper anti-corona precautions for the complete workforce, in a bid to hand over this hospital for its operationalisation by 5th of next month.

Citing the 'Stand Your Ground,' law, the Fifth District Court of Appeals dismissed the longstanding charges against a Port St. John man accused of shooting a Brevard County Sheriff's deputy during a botched arrest in front of his home in 2015.
   
 The decision -- issued Wednesday -- ends the prosecution of John DeRossett, 60, on the attempted premeditated first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer while discharging a firearm. DeRossett spent nearly five years at the Brevard County Jail Complex in Sharpes as he awaited a trial. He was allowed to leave on bond in March.
   
 "The appellate decision is better than a jury acquittal. An acquittal only means 'not guilty.' This order means that John is innocent, that his actions were justified, and that he never should have been arrested in the first place. It's a total vindication," said DeRossett's Orlando-based attorney, Michael Panella.
   
 , " . . . Great, great. Thank God. Thank Jesus. Thank everybody, thank you. You just don't know, how it feels, you know? I'm trying to hold the tears back," DeRossett said in a statement issued to FLORIDA TODAY.
   
 FLORIDA TODAY reached out to Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey for comment but no statements have been released.
   
 The appellate court found that DeRossett -- whose attorney's argued that he did not know he was firing at deputies -- was entitled to protect his home against what he thought was a threat.
   
 Prosecutors and Brevard County Sheriff's investigators said DeRossett opened fire at deputies conducting the arrest of his niece on a prostitution charge.
   
 DeRossett's attorney's argued that he did not know who the men were confronting his niece that night and that he was responding to her screams for help at the front door.
   
 Gunfire ensued and Deputy Casey Smith was shot in the lower abdomen. He recovered from his injuries. Both Ellis -- a convicted prostitute known as 'The Cougar' -- and DeRossett, then a security guard at Port Canveral suffered minor gunshot injuries, reports show.
   
 The state attorney's office issued a statement saying that it respected the court's decision but disagreed with the outcome.
   
 Our law enforcement officers risk their lives daily to protect our community. This ruling adds to that risk by extending protection to those who turn a blind eye to criminal activity, even within their own home."
   
 The shooting took place as the sheriff's office investigated reports of prostitution taking place at the home Mary Ellis DeRossett, 47, shared with her uncle, DeRossett.

According to the Prime Minister Office, the prime minister took a very serious view of the recent campaign on social media in which uncalled for, immoderate and intemperate language had been used against the superior judiciary, including the Chief Justice of Pakistan.
 “The prime minister has been pleased to direct that the director general, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to look into this malicious campaign and depute a team of suitable officers to track down the culprits involved therein and take necessary action as per the relevant laws,” it said, and noted that the matter be treated as most urgent.
 Meanwhile, the prime minister received Saylani Welfare Trust delegation that appreciated the efforts of the federal government, especially Prime Minister Imran Khan, to provide relief to the weaker sections in the current situation of the coronavirus.
 Special Assistant for Social Protection Dr Sania Nishtar and Focal Person for Shelter Nasimur Rehman also attended the meeting.

 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan has taken notice of Special Assistant for Health Dr Zafar Mirza for not presenting in an appropriate manner the government’s endeavours with regard to the fight against the coronavirus in the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
 It was learnt that the prime minister reprimanded the special assistant and said that as special assistant for health, it was his duty to present the government’s efforts to contain the virus before the Supreme Court in a respectful manner and in a comprehensive way.
 The special assistant failed to give satisfactory replies to questions asked by the apex court. During the federal cabinet meeting Tuesday, the prime minister expressed displeasure on this count and said that the incumbent government accorded utmost respect and honour to the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Chief Justice of Pakistan.
 The prime minister emphasised that no cabinet member or the government representative would be allowed to show irresponsible and non-serious attitude before the Supreme Court and that it would not be tolerated.
 On the orders of the apex court, the Health Ministry had submitted a report about the government steps to control the spread of coronavirus in the country.
 Meanwhile, the appointment of five advisers and 14 non-elected special assistants to prime minister in the cabinet of the ruing Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf (PT1) was challenged in the Supreme Court.
 Muhammad Arshad Khan Advocate, member Islamabad High Court Bar Association, and Ghulam Dastageer Butt Advocate, member Rawalpindi Bar Association, have field a joint petition in the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, praying for declaring the appointments of these advisers and special assistants to the prime minister against the Constitution.
 Besides the Federation and secretaries Cabinet, Establishment Division, Law and Justice as well secretary to PM, the petitioners have also made five advisers to PM including Malik Amin Aslam Khan, Adviser on Climate Change, Abdul Razak Dawood, Adviser on Commerce and Investment, Dr Ishrat Hussain, Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, Adviser on Finance and Revenue and Babar Awan, Adviser on Parliamentary Affairs as respondents.
 Similarly, 14 special assistants to prime minister Dr Sania Nishtar, SAPM on Social Protection and Poverty, Muhammad Shahzad Arbab, SAPM on Establishment, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, SAPM on Accountability and Interior, Syed Zulfiqar Abbas Bukhari, SAPM on Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, Shahzad Syed Qasim, SAPM on Coordination of Marketing and Development of Mineral Resource, Ali Nawaz Awan, SAMP on CDA, Muhammad Usman Dar, SAMP on Youth Affairs, Nadeem Afzal Gondal, SAPM on Parliamentary Coordination, Sardar Yar Muhammad Rind, SAPM on Power and Petroleum, Dr Zafar Mirza, SAPM on National Health Service Regulation and Coordination, Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan, SAPM on Information and Broadcasting, Nadeem Babar, SAMP on Petroleum, Dr Moeed Yousaf, SAPM on National Security and Strategic Policy Planning, and Ms Tania S Airdus SAPM on Digital Pakistan, were also made respondents.
 They have submitted that the appointment of the respondents No 6-24 are against the Constitution and law of the land.
 The petitioners contended that the Federation as well as secretaries of Cabinet, Law and Justice and Establishment Division have no authority to appoint any non-elected person as adviser or SAPM with the status of federal minister and minister of state. They prayed the court to declare that the exercise of any executive authority by the advisers and special assistants to prime minister is against the law and Constitution. They further prayed to the apex court to declare that these advisers and non-elected SAPMs are not entitled for any financial benefit including their salaries , allowances, perks and privileges having the status of federal minster and minster of state being advisers and SAPMs.
 Furthermore, the petitioners prayed that these five advisers and 14 special assistants to prime minister may be directed to surrender all the salaries and other perks and privileges obtained from the date of assuming of office till their removal.
 The petitioners submitted that the status, powers and rights of a federal minister or a minister of state cannot be conferred upon non-elected advisers and special assistants to the prime minister, nor can they sit in or participate in cabinet meetings conducted by the prime minister.
 The petitioners submitted that That article 93(1) speaks of two things in relation to the appointment of advisers: firstly, empowering the prime minister to appoint adviser(s) and secondly, preventing him from appointing more than a certain number.
 When it comes to the appointment of advisers, on the face of it, the president enjoys absolute and unfettered power; he can appoint any person, irrespective of whether he is a member of Parliament or not, the petitioners submitted, adding that this power is to be exercised according to the constitutional scheme, not brazenly and arbitrarily.
 Seemingly, the underlying intention of this provision is to accommodate highly educated and qualified people working in various walks of life who could not be elected to parliament or do not want to indulge in electoral politics. However, they said party loyalists are now joining the government under this provision, thereby defeating its real purpose. As for the restriction envisaged by the constitutional provision, they said, it limits the PM’s power to appoint advisers in respect of numbers.
 “In other words, the maximum number of advisers a PM may appoint at a time is five and any appointment beyond that limit would be unconstitutional,” the petitioners contended.

 The coronavirus pandemic will bear harsh consequences in Africa and the continent needs collective action to diminish its impacts, the regional director of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Africa said Thursday. There are over 17,000 confirmed cases across Africa, as the pandemic has reached each corner of the continent, Matshidiso Moeti told a joint media briefing with the WHO and World Economic Forum. She said humanitarian and economic consequences of the COVID-19 'pandemic will be profound in Africa, and we need solidarity and collective action to mitigate the impacts.' Moeti urged countries to ensure the 'maintenance of essential health services and' and said, 'other basic services must be a priority so that gains made in recent years are not reversed.' The WHO official added that they worked with Jack Ma Foundation and the Ethiopian government to begin solidarity flights transporting essential supplies and equipment to African countries, including personal protective equipment, as healthcare workers can safely treat 30,000 patients. The continent has also recorded 3,271 coronavirus recoveries and 896 deaths, according to the WHO's regional office for Africa. 'I have a lot of faith in African people and our communities,' Moeti said. US-WHO spat The WHO official said U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to suspend funding to the WHO will have significant consequences. 'The United States is the number one contributor to our budget,' Moeti said. 'The potential impact of this decision will be quite significant on areas such as polio eradication.' She added that other priority programs that address infectious diseases, such as HIV and malaria, will also be affected. The U.S. president Tuesday announced that he was suspending funding for the WHO, accusing the organization of 'severely mismanaging and covering up' the spread of the coronavirus. Moeti added that the U.S. government is an important partner for the WHO, not just in financial terms. 'They are important players in the WHO's policy and strategy making. We value the relationship,' she said. The virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China late last year, has spread to at least 185 countries and territories. It has killed more than 138,000 people and infected over 2 million so far.

We've all been lamenting the loss of the spring sports schedule due to the pandemic.
   
 Of course, we know there are bigger priorities in the world right now than the absence of sports. That goes without saying.
   
 But at the same time, sports fans are all trying to find ways to cope without live ballgames and activities.
   
 Sometimes we'll watch classic games, or in my case, watch the NFL RedZone channel's daily showings of last season's slate of games each week. Or on Facebook, we'll come across the memories signifying anniversaries of sporting events from a year ago to even 10 years ago.
   
 A high school softball mom the other day on Facebook posted a memory of her daughter showing off a home run ball she hit from a couple years ago. The mom added she can't wait for another season.
   
 I suddenly had a thought racing in my mind. So I replied to her with that thought. She agreed that it was a splendid idea.
   
 So here's that thought, and maybe you think it's crazy or maybe you think it's not:
   
 What if we can petition the Arkansas Activities Association to play the canceled spring sports schedule this fall, and just for this fall, to go along with the regular spring sports schedule for the coming school year?
   
 Provided, of course, that things return to normal by then.
   
 I know that it would be great for those underclassmen that barely or even hardly got to play any sports this spring to get some practice and playing time, not to mention experience, under their belts before resuming regular play in the spring.
   
 It can give schools a chance to regain some revenue that has been lost this spring with no games going on.
   
 And it can help the athletes instead of having to wait several more months to play spring sports. Plus, it can give their families and their friends the chance to see them play which they weren't able to for most of the spring.
   
 In Oklahoma, fast-pitch softball is played in the fall and high schools that don't play football have fall baseball, instead. And colleges and universities play soccer in the fall. So spring sports in the fall isn't necessarily a foreign concept around these parts.
   
 Of course, there may be some obstacles with this proposal.
   
 You won't have the full rosters for spring sports in the fall that you normally have in the spring. Especially when it comes to football. A baseball player who also plays football is going to generally pick the latter sport in the fall.
   
 And the fall sports schedule in Arkansas is busy enough as it is with football, not to mention volleyball, cross country, tennis and golf. Several administrators and coaches could potentially be stretched thin even more should spring sports be added to the fall schedule.
   
 Naturally, there's that chance media members like yours truly could also be frazzled by the time the holidays roll around, covering and keeping up with a vast array of sports during one typical week in the fall. But after getting an unexpected extended break from covering sports, I know for sure I would accept that challenge.
   
 Then of course there would be the logistics of trying to schedule a bunch of different sports at once. Maybe that could be alleviated by staggering the start of the different sports. Say, start baseball and softball in early August, track in October and soccer in November and December.
   
 And those seasons may not necessarily have to be too long, maybe a few weeks for each. And maybe not even schedule a postseason; that's really optional.
   
 But this way, it would be kind of making up for time that has been lost due to the shutdown.
   
 Maybe this idea still sounds crazy and far-fetched to you. But I bet there might be a lot of athletes, families, fans and coaches who could be on board with this proposal for the fall.
   
 So to paraphrase the late, great former Chicago Cubs legend Ernie Banks, for the next school year, let's play two (spring sports schedules).
   
 That is if it's OK to return to the world we once knew before the past several weeks unfolded.
