"Sex Education" star Asa Butterfield is happy that their show, a one of its kind young-adult high school series that explores the matters of the body, has normalised the discussion around the word "sex". Butterfield plays the show's lead protagonist Otis Milburn, an awkward teenager who ends up becoming something of a sex therapist to his peers. His partners-in-crime are his best friends Eric Effiong and Maeve Wiley, portrayed by Ncuti Gatwa and Emma Mackey, respectively.


  The British series, now in its second season, was a path-breaking success for Netflix with critics hailing its exploration of a number of issues such as sexual performance anxiety, impotency, abortion and social-media shaming among others. With the sophomore installment, showrunner Laurie Nunn has taken the discussion forward by including topics like sexual harassment and importance of consent.


  Butterfield said whatever inhibitions he may have had in the beginning, working on the show turned out to be a refreshing experience. "We knew what we were getting into when we started shooting and we have only become more comfortable with the story and the themes that it tackles in the new season," the actor told PTI in a telephonic interview from London.


  Though the show is set in the genre of sex comedy, Butterfield said it explores everything that teenagers go through. "Everyone has these issues and what we’re saying is that it's normal. I hope it takes the pressure off from people a little bit. But it's not just about sex. It’s a coming-of-age story, a love story, a friendship story... It’s very funny, but it’s got a lot of heart."


  The 22-year-old actor, who has featured in films such as "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas" , "X+Y" and Martin Scorsese's "Hugo", is particularly happy that the series has struck a chord with global audience. "The word sex is still a taboo for so many people around the world. Our show deals with it on so many levels. It makes me feel great that it has been able to resonate with the audiences, not just in the UK but all over. I knew it would be a risky issue to deal with but what I liked was that the script was venturing into an uncharted territory. "I hoped it would be talked about a bit but the reaction it has got from everywhere has blown me over. I didn't expect it to connect so instantly with so many people."


  For Mackey, it was important that the story addressed sexual harassment. "There are so many women in the UK and all over the world who don't report such incidents. People say these cases do not fall into sexual violence but they do. It is harassment and sexual assault. We need to call a spade a spade.


  "I think it is important to acknowledge that these cases are indeed referred to as sexual assault incidents. It made me proud that my show calls it." Mackey, 24, said she wouldn't have reported sexual assault had she faced it, but after seeing a character in the show go through such an ordeal changed her views.


  "It made me happy that my character was correctly able to say that this was sexual assault and Aimee needs to report it. Maeve goes to the police with her and comforts her. That was something I really admired about my character Maeve." "It was also eye-opening for young boys as they get to see things and get sensitised about what women go through on a regular basis," Butterfield added.


  Gatwa, who plays Eric, an openly gay teenager hailing from a religious Ghanaian-Nigerian family, said the best thing about the show was its gender- neutral gaze. "We see in the show what happens when there is a gender-neutral lens. We try to show the good and bad. It's real and raw, and the emotions are on the table. Our show tries give voice to people who thought they didn't have a voice.


  "It's about openness and having difficult conversations, facing things that don't make you that comfortable, and I've learnt a lot from Eric in that way. It's what the world needs - a very inclusive, diverse show," the 27-year-old actor said. The second season of "Sex Education" is currently streaming on Netflix.

All the music is familiar. Songs like “Chain of Fools,” “I heard it Through the Grapevine,” “A Sign of the Times” and “Stayin’ Alive.”


  The big difference is the words, which have been changed to fit this show about four women who meet at a lingerie counter in Bloomingdale’s and go on to form one of the most entertaining bonds in female-friendly history.


  “What’s Love Got to Do With it?” anyway.


  Taking advantage of every bit of humor in this hilarious and seemingly ageless show was director Allan Kollar, whose own gift of humor is a perfect match for such a show.


  That he had four talented females easily up to the task makes for an entertaining 90 minutes of mirth and merriment with liberal doses of zaniness.

Its tie-up with Wilton Reassurance Company on the back of growth initiatives launched in the last two years, will likely boost its growth going forward. Its capital management and reducing expenses also impress. It has been raising its quarterly dividend since 2013. The company has invested significantly in technology to improve agent productivity as well as sales and advertising. Shares of the company have underperformed its industry in a year's time. However, its deteriorating debt burden persists to elevate interest expenses, which drains the margins. A decline in interest earned ratio along with high debt raises financial risk."

With two huge region games coming up over the next week, it would have been easy for McDowell to look ahead Tuesday.


   


  Instead, the Trojans took care of business.


   


  William Jeffress scored 26 points and the Trojans were tough on defense as McDowell completed the season sweep of a short-handed Erie High 80-46 in a Region 7 boys basketball game on Tuesday at Paul Goll Gymnasium.


   


  "We've been stressing over the past few weeks to start games on the right foot, and we executed (Tuesday)," said McDowell coach Kevin O'Connor. "Erie is down some guys, that is clear, but I'm happy we didn't play down or overlook anyone."


   


  McDowell raced out to a 16-8 lead in the first quarter and extended it to 22-8 in the second before Erie started hitting some shots.


   


  The Trojans led 33-22 at the half before exploding for 29 points in the third quarter to pull away for the win. Jonah Bock was a spark in the third quarter as he knocked down three 3-pointers and finished with 11 points in the quarter.


   


  "He had all of his 11 points in the third and that's the kind of player he is," O'Connor said. "When he gets going he can do some big things."


   


  Jeffress added 13 points in the third after scoring 13 in the first half.


   


  "Everyone contributed and we played as a team," Jeffress said. "We played unselfish basketball and moved the ball well. Everyone played their role and came to play."


   


  Jackson Hower added 14 points for the Trojans, while Jaedan Jefferson had seven as 11 players scored for McDowell.


   


  "We wanted to come out as strong as possible and make a statement," Jeffress said. "Going into the stretch we are going into, we needed to gain some momentum and confidence and take it one game at a time. It's nice to sweep Erie, but we're on to the next game."


   


  Jaheim Mooney had 12 points and Jamie Smith had eight for an Erie team that was down several starters because of injuries.


   


  Erie (7-8 overall, 0-4 Region 7) will look to bounce back at Meadville on Friday, while McDowell (13-2, 4-0) hosts Kennedy Catholic in a first-place showdown. Kennedy Catholic is the defending District 10 and PIAA Class 6A champion.


   


  "I've had Friday circled on my personal schedule for a long time," O'Connor said. "Kennedy Catholic has been the king since they moved up to 6A and we're coming for the crown."

They should make it known that they understand, in no uncertain terms, that Florida — with its 1,200-plus miles of valuable coastline — is ground zero for the growing and costly threat of sea-level rise from a warming climate. That because of what's happening in this politically crucial state, the time for debate is over. This is the time for action, and the money to back it up. Possibly, the most politically inane thing this consummate political organization could do would be to bring a three-day confab to South Florida, which suffers from sunny day flooding and saltwater intrusion, and offer up nothing with regard to climate solutions.


  From the Florida Keys to Fort Walton Beach, Floridians — Republicans not excepted — care about climate change and the billions of dollars in related costs we face in coming years. According to a statewide survey released by Florida Atlantic University last fall, more than two-thirds of Floridians say that climate change has them concerned about the well-being of future generations in Florida and do not feel government is doing enough to address the impacts.


  Nearly six in 10 (57%) of Florida Republicans support government action to address climate change, according to a Yale University-George Mason University-Climate Nexus poll taken in June.


  “Republicans have figured out that if you get caught crossways on the environment, you could very well lose an election. That's how important the issue is to Floridians of all stripes,” Susan MacManus, a former political science professor at the University of South Florida, told the AP.


  A rising tide of concern is undeniable across the state — starting in South Florida, where four county governments created the state’s first climate change compact more than a decade ago. Municipal governments and business groups are forming their own collaborations. Other regions of the state are mimicking South Florida’s model — like the Tampa Bay Regional Resiliency Coalition.


  How pointed is the issue here? While the RNC is meeting in Doral, the University of Miami is hosting a three-day symposium about the growing link between climate change and the trend of bigger, stronger, wetter Atlantic hurricanes — like Irma, Michael and Dorian. That follows an Everglades advocates’ meeting last week on Captiva Island to discuss resiliency for the fabled “River of Grass” in the face of a changing climate.


  But Florida Republicans know all of this. Gov. Ron DeSantis has opened the door in state government to climate talk and action. That’s a door that had been closed for nearly a decade under his predecessor, Rick Scott — who now, as a U.S. senator, has done a modest about-face, saying that he believes “climate change is real and requires real solutions.” It is worth noting, however, that DeSantis didn’t mention climate change even once during his State of the State address last week.

  Now, thanks to a road swap with Sarasota County, the state is taking it over and will be responsible for long-overdue improvements.

It was like watching some of the Stoke sides of the last 10-15 years, the ones which so mercilessly and relentlessly tormented The Baggies and which filled us all which such pride. On Monday night it actually felt as though we’d got that side back and it was wonderful. We’ve talked (prematurely we now know) in the past about corners being turned for our club but this time it genuinely feels as though something has changed; as though a line in the sand has finally been drawn.


  The players are starting to perform to the standards we’d expect for both the level of ability they undoubtedly possess and the considerable sums of money we paid for them. This has to be down to the regime, direction and ethics imposed by Michael O’Neill but at the same time we should all acknowledge (especially those of us, like myself, who slated their efforts earlier this season) that the players have knuckled down and rolled their sleeves up for the fight.


  Whether this anything to do with supporters letting them know that their previous efforts were not good enough is neither here nor there. We are all behind our club, eager to forgive and forget, and more than ready to worship those who give their all to the cause of the red and white stripes.

“I was pleased,” Joplin coach Jeff Hafer said. “I don’t think we’ve beaten Parkview in nine years, so it was a good win for us.”


  In a fast-paced, back-and-forth clash between former Ozark Conference rivals, Joplin’s Isaiah Davis hit 1-of-2 free throws with eight seconds left to give the Eagles a three-point cushion.


  After a timeout, Parkview’s Nakai Johnson misfired on an off-balance NBA- range 3-point attempt just before the buzzer.


  “They ran a really good play, but we forced them into a tough pass and a tough shot,” Hafer said. “We covered it well, so I was proud of our kids. That’s a tough situation. We’ve got to close out games better, but they’re not all going to be pretty.”


  For the visitors, a late-game comeback fell short.


  “We played hard,” Vikings coach Landon Cornish said. “There were just a few possessions here and there where we gave up layups or drove in and took a bad shot. We were a couple plays away. That’s been the story of our year.”


  Four players scored in double figures for the Eagles (11-4). Senior guard Dakarai Allen led Joplin with 20 points on eight field goals and 4-of-4 free throws, while backcourt mate Davis added 19 points on eight hoops and 3-of-7 foul shots.


  Senior guard/forward Zach Westmoreland chipped in 15 points on six field goals and two charities, while sophomore guard Always Wright contributed 11 with three 3-pointers.


  Parkview (5-8) received a game-high 26 points from senior guard Dontae Taylor. Elijah Whitley and Trevon Brazile chipped in 10 points apiece for the Vikings.

He will be the larger than life leader that he has been, but he won't be president,” the former Law Minister said in an interview with the _The Hindu_.


  “We should be looking for a leader who can work in tandem and not a replacement for Rahul Gandhi. I think it will be a mistake to for a replacement while he is vigorous, determined and made a clear indication that he would be there to fight with the forces we want to fight,” he added.


  Talking about the ‘young versus the old’ debate that has broken out in choosing the next Congress chief, he said, “The ideological position must be let's have somebody who is really outstanding, somebody who is the best. It doesn't matter what their age is. Obviously, if you are very old then you cannot lead for the next 10 years. We already have a young leader in Mr. Rahul Gandhi and you need a companion leader who could lead for the next five or 10 years and build from where we are today.”


  Ahead of the formal launch of his book, _Visible Muslim Invisible Citizen_ , the former Law Minister spoke with the _The Hindu_ on a range of subjects: from the Congress’ current leadership crisis to the 2019 election results to discussing what defines an Indian Muslim.


  “There is an Indian identity of Muslims. It can be progressive modern Muslim, it can be conservative Muslim, it can be an unbelieving or an atheist Muslim. And that’s true of every Indian. When I come across somebody from Uttar Pradesh who is not a Muslim by birth but can speak Urdu better than I or can recite poetry, I see the Muslim-ness of that person. It's both Indian-ness and Muslim-ness of that person,” he said.


  The former Union minister said the election results have stunned his party and it needs time to decipher it.


  “I don't favour the argument that being a secular Hindu, you cannot vote for the BJP. You can vote for the BJP or some other party. A lot of people who were not socialists or communists had voted for us when Mrs Indira Gandhi had a socialist platform. So, we need a little more time to understand this election,” Mr. Khurshid said talking about the election.


  Asked about a growing perception that Congress is making a tactical retreat from the secular space and has not protested against the recent spate of lynchings, he said, “This perception that Congress is withdrawing itself is just as false as the perception that Congress was a Muslim party.”

Per questo secondo gruppo, le accuse sono di altra natura, anche se vario titolo connesse, ed escludono il loro coinvolgimento diretto negli sbarchi. I fatti contestati risalgono al 2017. Il 23 luglio 2019, Licciardi, Bouaicha, i due Zayar e Taleb sono rimasti coinvolto anche nell'operazione della Guardia di finanza di Marsala "Sea Ghost". E la settimana scorsa, per loro, e arrivata la decisione del gip di Palermo Antonella Consiglio di giudizio immediato. Come chiesto dalla Dda. L'operazione "Caronte" scatto a seguito di complesse indagini, con pedinamenti e intercettazioni, nel corso delle quali gli investigatori riuscirono a documentare le varie fasi organizzative ed esecutive delle traversate, attuate con potenti motoscafi che, dalle spiagge di Al Huwariyah, in Tunisia (punto piu vicino alle coste italiane), raggiungevano il litorale trapanese (in particolare Marsala o Mazara), percorrendo in media circa 100 miglia marine. Le indagini presero spunto dalla denuncia di furto di un gommone, poi risultata infondata, fatta proprio da uno dei componenti dell'organizzazione presso la stazione Carabinieri di Menfi. Sin dai primi accertamenti era infatti emerso il sospetto che il natante fosse stato invece utilizzato per una delle traversate. E' stato appurato, in particolare, che il gruppo criminale avrebbe portato a termine vari sbarchi, tra cui quelli del 2 gennaio 2017 e del 17 febbraio 2017, avvenuti sulle coste del trapanese. Si e accertato, inoltre, che il ruolo di coordinamento delle operazioni delittuose veniva svolto da un italiano, il quale spesso si recava personalmente in Tunisia, imbarcandosi dal porto di Palermo o direttamente dall'aeroporto del capoluogo siciliano, allo scopo di poter meglio gestire l'organizzazione dei viaggi e prendere accordi diretti con i tunisini compiacenti del posto.

DECATUR COUNTY – This is January, for sure. I was beginning to wonder, but I didn’t need to. I would like to have it now rather than just a tease like we had a week or so ago. This is good weather to stay in and work on your hobbies. I have been doing a lot of sewing, mostly on charity work. I have a bunch of bulging boxes of quilt squares that have been given to me, so I’m trying to make something useful out of them. I know there are a lot of people that could use them whenever I get them finished. I call it mindless sewing as I just pick up the pieces and let them fall where they may and make something out of them. I have several projects in the works that do take some thought, so will get to them some of these days.


  Club Presidents, I will remind you that the February Council meeting has been moved up a week to January 27 at 6 p.m. at the Extension Office. Mark your calendars as there are some important items of business to be brought up. Also, mark your calendar for March 10 for our Madison District spring meeting at Rising Sun, and March 17 for our International Night when we will be visiting Israel.


  I would like to congratulate our Certificate of Distinction winners for last year. Isabel Royse and Charles Fisse were chosen for the award. Isabel is a member of the Fifty Homemakers Club, a very active one. She spends a lot of time working with the Christmas Child boxes that are collected at Christmastime. She and the rest of her club work on projects throughout the year to put into the boxes. One of the main things the rest of the Homemakers do is the shorts that are made for little boys. It seems there is never enough things for the boys, especially those 12 to 14 years old. She organizes workshops to work on them three or more times a year. She is also active in her church and helps with Lions Club projects.

Before we get too carried away we have to realise we have to take a moment to remember where we are. We’re not out out of the woods yet - not by a long measure. A loss of focus or any form of complacency could quickly see us slip back into serious trouble. I don’t think that is going to happen though. We’re sure to suffer some more reverses between now and the end of the season, and experience the pain of defeat, but I’m sure the trend will be upwards and that we’ll win more than we lose between now and the middle of May.


  For what remains of this season, the principle objective for Stoke City is get away from the bottom of the table. This transcends all other considerations. After that it is to start building for beyond this campaign. One of the key aspects of this rebuilding task is to make sure we hold on to a player like Tyrese Campbell.


  His winning goal at The Hawthorns, where he was given the starting job of leading the line, was further proof of his growing stature, fitness and maturity and showed just how important he is becoming to us. His profile is rising by the week and despite his unfortunate hamstring injury there will be plenty of clubs sitting up and taking notice of his abilities and his potential availability come the end of this season.

That’s the kind of abilities he has. He was a good prospect, a little rough around the edges because he was a kid who was focusing on another sport. Baseball was something that he liked doing.
