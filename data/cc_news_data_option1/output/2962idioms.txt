L’Unchr, l’Agenzia Onu per i rifugiati, “deplora la tragica perdita di tre vite umane” e chiede “un’indagine urgente” a seguito della sparatoria avvenuta ieri sera al punto di sbarco di Al Khums in Libia, dopo che un’imbarcazione era stata intercettata dalla Guardia costiera libica. La sparatoria è avvenuta dopo lo sbarco di oltre 70 persone. L’International rescue committee (Irc), partner di Unhcr, ha aiutato a trasportare in ambulanza fino all’ospedale un uomo ferito che è però morto durante il tragitto. Altre due persone sono morte sul luogo dell’incidente e altre due sono rimaste ferite. I tre morti erano cittadini sudanesi. Le altre persone sbarcate sono state trasferite nei centri di detenzione. “Questo incidente sottolinea con forza che la Libia non è un porto sicuro per lo sbarco”, ha detto l’inviato speciale dell’Unhcr per la situazione del Mediterraneo centrale, Vincent Cochetel: “È necessario aumentare la capacità di ricerca e soccorso nel Mediterraneo, includendo le navi delle Ong, al fine di aumentare la probabilità che le operazioni di salvataggio conducano allo sbarco in porti sicuri al di fuori della Libia. C’è anche bisogno di maggiore solidarietà tra gli Stati costieri del Mediterraneo”.
