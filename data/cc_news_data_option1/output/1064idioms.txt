This Amazon production, which premieres as a stream on March 20, is a nicely constructed, low-budget thriller that features many layers that its writing- directing partners Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy manage to keep on an even, slowly unfolding keel. Not surprisingly, it opens in song, on an ocean pier, with a fisherman, accompanied by three other fishermen, belting out the title song.      But why they're singing it, and why the film takes its name from it, is and will remain a bigger mystery than the multiple mysteries that move the film along.      The location is the fictional Easter Cove, Maine, where two women, Pris (Sophie Lowe) and her younger sister Mary Beth (Morgan Saylor) - they're known in town as the Connolly girls - are sharing a drink before attending the funeral of their mother.      Though this appears to be the beginnings of a character study on the differences between the siblings - they're close, but Pris is the responsible one, Mary Beth is the wild child - it soon heads off into all sorts of directions, with many other people.      Post-funeral, Mary Beth heads for the local bar for a few drinks, but has some trouble with local bad apple Gorski (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who comes on to her, won't let up and - since this happens so early in the film, I'll give it away - is killed by her in self-defense, with a harpoon assist.      Uh-oh, this is not the kind of thing you want to be caught up in in a small town. Good thing steady-nerved Pris is around to figure out what to do, to put a plan in motion to get rid of the body. But this proves to be no easy feat, and in one of the film's best darkly humorous lines of dialogue, as they're trying to stuff him in a cooler, a shaken Mary Beth says, "What are we supposed to do, Pris? Chop his arms off?"      Well, yeah! And that very sharp knife with the Connolly fishing business name emblazoned on it should do the trick. And the endless ocean would be a great place to dump the cooler.      Time to meet more people. There's Enid (Margo Martindale), who runs the Ocean View B&B; (which really should be called a B&B;&B; because it's also a brothel). And there's a trio of longtime residents - Susie, Gail, and Doreen (June Squibb, Annette O'Toole, Marceline Hugot) who seem to know everything about everyone. And there are a couple of cops - one is a regular customer at the B&B;&B;, the other is an inquisitive man just doing his job.      Before you can catch a breath, a body washes up onshore, and when the sisters find out, they panic. But it turns out to be a bullet-riddled woman (no harpoon marks!) who worked at the B&B;&B;, and she wasn't exactly preparing breakfasts or making beds. Look out! Nasty, foul-mouthed working woman Lexie (Gayle Rankin) is soon making things even murkier.      By the time the expanding series of plotlines introduces a bag with $50,000 cash, and the Connolly knife has gone missing, you're wondering where else this story can possibly turn. Some sleepy little town!      The film is about all of these people and incidents, but the focus eventually comes around to Enid, and Martindale gives a frightening, multi-textured performance as a powerful woman who's juggling a lot of secrets.      There are questions everywhere you turn, and just about all of them are answered. But the writers-directors couldn't quite lick the problem of how to end it, and in an attempt to wrap things up, those answers are delivered too quickly, too neatly. And I'm still wondering why the film is called "Blow the Man Down."      "Blow the Man Down" premieres on Amazon on March 20.      Ed Symkus writes about movies for More Content Now.

Some restaurants, Czapski said, may be better suited to weather the storm than others, like those that already handle a healthy amount of traffic through their takeout and delivery services as opposed to those who do most of their business with patrons dining in.
 Czapski also pointed to the very real problem of lost sales tax, using the closure of the Rocky Gap Casino Resort as an example. The casino, he noted, had high daily revenues before being ordered to close because of virus concerns, along with Maryland's other casinos and bingo halls. They generate a lot of sales tax, he noted, that is fed back into the state and local economy. All that money is now effectively missing, he said.
 Still, Czapski said, for all the trepidation the situation has some bright spots.
 “A lot of the agencies are coming together and trying to find their lane," Czapski said. "Everyone wants to do something. As quickly as this is moving there are a lot of organizations that want to come together. …There's a lot of good things.”
 He did, however, note that it was hard to predict what the future holds for Allegany County's affected businesses, but said he expected both positive and negative changes to take place.
 “As they say, this too shall pass," Czapski said. "We will look different because of it. I believe there will be some closures, but I can’t even imagine what that number will be.”
 Reached by phone Monday afternoon, Tony Ottaviani, owner of Ristorante Ottaviani, said he had “absolutely no idea what to think."
 On social media last week, the restaurant announced that they'd offer a $20 gift certificate for a future dine-in visit to customers who place a carryout order for $25 or more. Ottaviani said they'd had the idea last Friday as a means of hopefully drumming up business after a string of reservation cancelations. So far, he said, they haven't had many takers: Maybe three or four people called in to take advantage of the offer this weekend, Ottaviani said, “but that was before we weren’t even allowed to be open.”
 "I hope we get enough people to keep some money coming in," Ottaviani said. "Unless somebody knows something I don’t, I think this is all a little bit much. We’re going to do our best to incentivize people to come in.”

Three years ago, U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross and many of his New Jersey colleagues in Congress were celebrating the Air Force's announcement that Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst would become home to at least two dozen of the newest tanker jets, the KC-46.
   
 The Boeing-built jets are expected to phase out the Air Force's fleet of legacy KC-10 tankers from the 1980s and even some of the older KC-135s that have helped refuel other aircraft and move personnel and supplies since the 1950s. And the decision to locate the new KC-46s at the joint base was celebrated as a momentous development that would ensure the future of the base's critical air-refueling mission for decades to come.
   
 "Today's news marks the next chapter in the joint base's outstanding service to America, and the future looks strong," Norcross, D-1 of Camden, said back in January 2017, when the Air Force announced the joint base would receive the new tankers in 2021.
   
 But development of the new tankers has suffered some high-profile delays and setbacks, the biggest being a still-unsolved glitch surrounding the plane's Remote Vision System software, which allows the flight crew's boom operator to guide the refueling arm used to fill up other jets in flight.
   
 The issue has raised questions about when the KC-46s will become fully operational, both for refueling operations at home and abroad. It's caused some in Congress to consider whether the Air Force should continue accepting the new jets being built by Boeing, as well as whether it should follow through with a plan to retire 16 of the legacy KC-10 tankers during the 2021 fiscal year.
   
 The proposed 2021 retirement plan calls for 14 of the 32 KC-10s stationed at the joint base to be retired. The other two jets being retired are at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California, according to Norcross' office.
   
 Over 1,000 jobs on the base are attached to the big tankers.
   
 Delaying retirement?
   
 In response, Norcross and other members of New Jersey's delegation, including Rep. Andy Kim, D-3 of Moorestown, have started engaging with Air Force brass and other defense leaders about potentially delaying the KC-10 retirements.
   
 At the same time, they're also opposing efforts to either pause or slow the delivery of the KC-46s.
   
 In an interview, Norcross said he believes that stopping production and delivery of the new tankers would be a mistake.
   
 "We've been very deep in the weeds with the new Remote Vision System. I now know more about depth perception than I ever imagined," the congressman said Thursday. "We have to get this right. We have many missions out there that depend on (refueling)."
   
 But he added that "95% of the plane does not involve the Remote Vision System," so he sees no reason to halt production or delivery of the jets.
   
 "We can build those planes and continue its mission while (the Remote Vision System) is being fixed," Norcross said Wednesday during an Armed Services Committee hearing featuring Gen. Steve Lyons, commander of the U.S. Transportation Command.
   
 He also supports delaying retirement of the KC-10s.
   
 Originally, six of the joint base's big tankers were scheduled to be taken out of service next year as part of the transition to the KC-46s. However, the number was increased to 14 as part of the Pentagon's budget proposal, an unexpected move that the Air Force described as a cost-saving measure that would help ensure the military has the funds needed to continue its modernization.
   
 The budget also calls for the continued procurement of more KC-46s from Boeing.
   
 Norcross said the move to retire additional KC-10s was surprising but also one the Air Force is willing to reconsider if additional funding is made available. He said estimates are that another $70 million would stave off the additional retirements.
   
 "The Air Force wants to keep (the KC-10s), but we need to find the money," he said. "I believe we will find that money."
   
 Advocating for the base
   
 Norcross has been in this fight before. Almost from his first day in Washington, the Camden lawmaker has made protecting McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst his adopted cause.
   
 The base may not technically be part of his district, but the former electrician and state legislator knows how important the megabase is to New Jersey as a whole and South Jersey in particular.
   
 Only the state government itself employs more people, and the installation is credited with contributing billions to the state's economy, to say nothing of its importance to national security.
   
 It's why Norcross pushed for a spot on the House Armed Services Committee, the congressional panel responsible for overseeing military spending and policy. He's now chairman of the panel's Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee. And it's also why he has become so deeply involved with Boeing's development of the KC-46.
   
 During his first year in office, Norcross also teamed with former Republican Congressman Tom MacArthur in sponsoring an amendment to the annual defense policy and spending bill that protected the KC-10s from retirement.
   
 The KC-10 fleet was being targeted at the time to squeeze under sequestration- imposed spending caps. New Jersey officials feared that if the joint base lost those planes before KC-46 replacements were assigned, it would put the installation at risk, particularly during another round of base closures.
   
 MacArthur and Norcross succeeded in getting language inserted into a defense bill signed into law in 2015 that prevented the Air Force from retiring the KC-10s without assigning replacements. However, that prohibition was for only two years, making the Air Force's decision to locate the new jets in New Jersey all the more important.
   
 An upgrade
   
 Despite the newer jets' well-publicized problems, Norcross believes the newer tankers will be a significant upgrade.
   
 While smaller than the KC-10s, the KC-46s will have more advanced refueling capabilities, including the ability to refuel two aircraft simultaneously and capacity to get refueled in flight itself, according to military officials.
   
 Norcross also said delays in the production of the plane have resulted in some additional improvements in the technology.
   
 "It's been over a decade since it was first ordered. So it's 2020 tech and the finest in the world," he said. "When you speak to the pilots, they love the new airplane."
   
 Norcross also stressed that the expense of the Remote Vision System retrofit and other fixes were being incurred by Boeing, which has a fixed contract. "The bad news is it's taken this long. The good news is it's on Boeing's dime," he said.
   
 Preparations are underway at the joint base for the arrival of the first KC-46s as early as fall 2021. More than $146 million is being invested on the base to prepare for the jets, including construction of an $82.5 million hangar and other improvements, including a fuselage trainer, boom operating training, and aerospace ground equipment storage building.
   
 In addition to fighting for funding to keep the KC-10s flying, Norcross promised to continue battling the Trump administration's plan to divert $3.8 billion in defense funding to build additional sections of the southern border wall. He described the move as a "bad strategic decision" that has put an additional strain on the Pentagon's finances.
   
 He said finding $70 million for the KC-10s would not be an issue if not for the president's diversion.
   
 "It would not be a problem if that had not happened. Everyone is looking for resources across the spectrum."

MOUNT HOLLY -- Burlington County government offices will be closed to the public starting Monday, officials announced late Sunday night.
   
 Officials said the decision was made "in the interest of maintaining the well being of all county employees through the preservation of a safe working environment and the need to deliver necessary services during the crisis."
   
 The county offices will be closed until further notice, a spokesman said Monday morning.
   
 While the public will be kept out of most county buildings, all county employees will report for normal duties as scheduled. Last week the county's largest employee union urged the freeholders to enhance cleaning of the buildings to ensure safety.
   
 The state Superior Court in Mount Holly will also remain open, but new jury trials have been suspended. The courthouse shares space in the county complex off Rancocas Road in Mount Holly with the county government.
   
 The Burlington County Board of Social Services, which has its offices in Westampton, also will remain open.
   
 Services at Burlington County Resource Recovery Complex will continue on a normal schedule, but the county animal shelter in Westampton will open for pet recovery only.
   
 The nutritional program for Woman, Infants and Children (WIC) will open for scheduled appointments on Monday. After that, WIC cash assistance will continue, but all other WIC services will be closed to the public, officials said.
   
 The county government announcement comes hours after Gov. Phil Murphy said not enough state residents are practicing the "social distancing" required to contain the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus and that the state is preparing to launch new mitigation efforts.
   
 "Not enough is being done. There's too much business as usual," Murphy said Sunday during his administration's daily briefing on the outbreak.
   
 During the briefing, officials announced 31 new positive coronavirus cases across the state since Saturday, including a new Burlington County case and a second fatality. Statewide, there are now 98 total cases across the state.
   
 Burlington County officials subsequently announced the new case was a 43-year- old Moorestown man whose exposure to COVID-19 is still under investigation.
   
 Authorities said the county health department "is currently conducting contact screening and will be reaching out to individuals who have been in contact with the patient."
   
 County health officials also revealed a second newly confirmed case involving a 63-year-old woman who is believed to have become infected with the virus while traveling.
   
 There are now five confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county.
   
 Murphy has already recommended that all events over 250 people should be canceled and he said additional mitigation actions are in the works. Among the measures the state is strongly considering is a statewide school closure order that could come as early as Monday and a likely nighttime curfew across the state, he said.
   
 Burlington County schools are already closed and are not set to reopen until April 20.
   
 County officials also announced Sunday that all county library and parks buildings would be closed due to the outbreak. Park grounds and trails will remain open but restrooms are closed.
   
 All park events are canceled, Burlington County officials said.
   
 On Sunday, the governor also issued a directive to all state departments and agencies directing them to develop plans to authorize state employees to work from home if able by Wednesday.
   
 "We've got to shake this state from business as usual and we need to do it in the next 24 hours," Murphy said. "We need not just most of us to take the social distancing to heart."
   
 Among the new cases reported Sunday by the Department of Health was a Monmouth County woman in her 50s who died at Centra State Medical Center in Freehold, Monmouth County.
   
 Health officials were unaware of any other medical conditions but said the woman was believed to have been exposed to the virus at a family gathering attended by her brother, who was friends with a Bergen County man who also died from the illness.
   
 Murphy and state Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said social distancing by all residents was critical to slowing the spread of the illness.
   
 "These measures are a common sense approach. I can't emphasize enough how important it is to avoid gatherings large and small," Persichilli said. "Even smaller gathers have the potential to spread COVID-19."
   
 The city of Hoboken in Hudson County has already announced a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew starting Monday and Teaneck in Bergen County has also instructed all its residents to self-quarantine.
   
 On Sunday, Murphy hinted that a statewide curfew was in the works. He said reports of people gathering in bars and taverns for St. Patrick's Day weekend revelry indicated statewide action is likely required.
   
 "I saw too many videos of packed bars, people drinking out of the same bottles," he said. "We believe (a curfew) will have a meaningful, positive outcome."
   
 He also said closure of Atlantic City casinos was also being considered. He said the initial belief was that casinos canceling their large events was sufficient and that the casino floors were expansive enough that people could safely remain separated.
   
 However, he said the casinos status was also being reviewed and that closures were under "intense consideration."
   
 Murphy defended his authority to impose quarantines, curfews and other actions to curtail social gatherings, but he encouraged residents to take the actions voluntarily to protect themselves and others.
   
 "It's inevitable all 21 counties will have cases. We need to employ much more aggressive action to make sure people are shaken from this business as usual. The next seven to 14 days will define the shape of the curve," he said, referencing the "flatten the curve" strategy to slow the spread of the disease so that it does not overwhelm hospitals and other providers capacity to respond to the outbreak.
   
 Currently, New Jersey has a capacity of just under 2,000 intensive care beds across the state. However, officials said steps are being taken to try to boost that capacity, including reopening recently closed hospitals.
   
 In addition to announcing the directive to allow state employees to work from home, Murphy also revealed Sunday that he has written to the Trump administration to formally ask the federal government to reopen the health care enrollment period for individuals to obtain coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
   
 "With COVID-19 now a pandemic and confirmed cases increasing in New Jersey and across the country, it is imperative that we take all appropriate actions to increase access to screening, testing, and treatment related to COVID-19," Murphy wrote in a letter to U.S. Department Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma.
   
 "While I have coordinated across state agencies to take emergency action to facilitate access to screening, testing and access to care for the residents of New Jersey, more can be done to ensure every individual has access to appropriate health care during this crisis."

The spreading coronavirus is threatening project schedules in the booming U.S. solar industry following a year in which the sector topped natural gas as the nation's top new power source, according to a report published on Tuesday.
 Fallout from the pandemic has impacted both supply chains and demand in the fast-growing industry, and the president of the top U.S. solar trade group said its annual market report's projection of 47% growth in 2020 will be ratcheted down in the coming weeks and months.
 It was still too soon to incorporate the pandemic's impact into the sector's outlook with certainty, the Solar Energy Industries Association said.
 "It's really across the board a pretty significant crisis in the solar industry in addition to a significant crisis in the overall economy," Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in an interview.
 Solar companies are facing not only disruptions to supplies of components such as panels and inverters, but labor shortages as Americans are asked to limit social contacts to reduce the spread of the Covid-19 disease or are forced to stay home due to school closures, Hopper said. In the rooftop solar market, homeowners may be putting large investments on hold for the time being, she added.
 The slowdown marks a major about-face for the industry, which has been growing rapidly as states and businesses seek to move away from fossil fuels amid growing concerns about their role in climate change.
 The industry has 10 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale projects currently under construction, the report said. Once online, they would generate enough power for about 1.9 million homes.
 Last year, the U.S. solar industry installed 13.3 GW of capacity, a 23% increase from the prior year. Utility-scale projects accounted for nearly two- thirds of the market.
 Solar accounted for 40% of the nation's new electric generating capacity, compared with 32% for natural gas and 27% for wind.
 The residential solar market had its biggest year every for installations at 2.8 GW. The sector benefited from increased demand in California after planned power outages during wildfire season left hundreds of thousands of utility customers in the dark, the report said.

A couple weeks ago, Logan Municipal Council Member Jess Bradfield put out a poll on Facebook asking people to choose what they would do with $15 million. The choices included many of the proposed ideas to replace the Emporium, including a museum, a library, a splash pad/plaza, high density housing development, a parking garage and others.
 Nearly 300 people responded to the Facebook post, after which Bradfield gathered the answers and displayed the results in a pie chart.
 A new library was the front-runner at 24% with comments citing the average of 600 visitors that frequent the library as a reason to make it the priority.
 “I’m trying to make sure the city’s priorities are aligned with the resident’s priorities,” Bradfield said. “I appreciate all of the efforts the city has put into the current plan but I would be remiss if we didn’t address the topic that started all of this.”
 Bradfield was referring to the library, it being part of the discussion from the time the city first purchased the Emporium property.
 In April 2016, the Logan Municipal Council voted unanimously to purchase the Emporium property. Then-Mayor Craig Petersen read from a prepared statement that evening about the hope to use that space for a library.
 “One approach is to wait for the unassisted private sector to rejuvenate this space. But 40 years of history in the Emporium casts doubt on that happening in the near future,” Petersen said. “How long should we persist with a dead spot in the core of downtown Logan? I believe that a better option is for the city to purchase the property and either use it for a library or, if another location is determined preferable for a library, to aggressively work with and incentivize private parties to develop the space for commercial activity.”
 Council Member Tom Jensen said there have been many discussions since that meeting four years ago, which included considerations for space and expenses.
 “As consultants were brought in, including library consultants and architectural consultants, along with a public outcry against the idea, it was determined that the library would not be the right fit,” Jensen said. “Architectural consultants said the building didn’t provide the access or type of configuration that would suit the library. The building itself is not seismically sound and a new use for the space would mean a costly upgrade.”

Jensen said there were a number of reasons that community members brought up against the library going in that spot, including the opinion that a multistory building could prove uncomfortable or inconvenient for parents with young children.
 Jensen said he also remembers pushback on the idea that the library would be good for downtown because people would go downtown for the library and linger around the other shops.
 “As a number of people have pointed out, patrons who come to the library are not necessarily looking for shoes or dresses,” Jensen said. “Going to the library generally means you go, pick up books and go home. I was really excited about the library being in that spot in the beginning, but as more and more people argued against it, I could see it wouldn’t work by the evidence that came out.”
 The first time a sans-library plan for the Emporium plot was presented was in September 2019 when one of the early renderings of the city’s plaza model was introduced.
 “When we did the study for a new library the square footage was 40,000, so it would be very difficult to place a library in the footprint of the current Emporium location with housing on top — and we would still have other parking issues,” said Council Member Jeannie Simmonds, responding to questions about the possibility of a new library during the recent public hearing.
 Logan resident Keegan Garrity helped facilitate conversations about the library project on both social media and in public meetings. Garrity argues that there is in fact enough space for a library in that spot.
 “The question that we are asking here is, ‘What draws people to downtown?” Garrity said in the recent RDA public hearing. “If we are looking for something guaranteed to draw residents downtown, we need to look no further than a library.”
 Citing a Gallup survey done last year which revealed that attending the library was the most enjoyed activity by people in the U.S., Garrity stood by the idea that a library in the Emporium lot would most benefit Logan residents.
 “Despite its dilapidated condition, people still come,” Garrity said about the current library. “After the purchase of the Emporium in 2016, several other sites have been considered such as the Grizzly gas station and the Army surplus store, and now another location is in the works.

While so many _Star Wars_ fans have dreamed of experiencing that galaxy far, far away for so long — drinking blue milk, sipping cocktails in the cantina, yielding a lightsaber — there’s none of that achievable in-world experience baked into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a world focused on superheroic deeds that leaves little room for us common folk. So Walt Disney Imagineers had to invent it. Framing Avengers Campus as a training facility solved one problem — namely, why all these folks are together in Anaheim, Hong Kong, and Paris (the three interconnected Disney theme park lands) in the first place. So did calling it a "multiverse" where anything can happen, providing a loophole for characters that perished in _Avengers: Endgame_. Filling it with experiences that feel authentic to the films but worthwhile for guests, though? That was entirely another.

--DocBreak--
SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) - We saw a nice, but chilly day across western Mass to kick off the week. Overall, this week will feel more like March with temperatures a little closer to normal. We do have a few weather systems coming through that will bring chances for rain and even a little winter weather!
 Tonight, clouds have moved back in and will continue to thicken overnight. Temperatures will fall into the upper 20s to low 30s through sunrise, but there will be a bit of a wind chill as southeasterly winds stay around 5 to 10mph.
 Light precipitation will begin falling sometime after 4am and should fall as snow for a few hours, then change to rain. Little to no snow accumulation is expected and any snow we do see should be pretty light. If any accumulation does occur, it would be in the northwest hills and stay mostly on grass, with a half inch or less. Temperatures will climb back to the 40s Tuesday with a southerly breeze shifting west by the end of the day as a cold front passes through.

When she was young, Rihanna's father sold clothes on the street or out of his car to make a living. Whether through want or necessity, she would sometimes join him. "She used to sell stuff on the side of the street like I did," Rihanna's dad, Ronald Fenty, said in a 2011 interview with _The Sun_. "She'd come outside of the store and put up a rack and sell hats and belts and scarves ... She would also buy sweets, put them in packages and take them to school to sell to her friends for a profit." It was that entrepreneurial spirit that had Rihanna's father thinking she would end up in business. In the end, he was right, in a way.

BELLINGHAM - A Bellingham man was drunk when he struck and killed a person with his car on Center Street on Friday before fleeing the scene, authorities said.
 Police arrested Richard Latraverse, 73, after the crash, Worcester county District Attorney spokesman Timothy Connolly said on Monday.
 The time of the incident was not available. Authorities said Latraverse was driving his car when he struck the victim and then drove off. Latraverse returned to the scene and later identified himself, authorities said.
 Police arrested Latraverse, whose address was not available, and charged him with two counts of motor vehicle homicide by negligent operation and drunken driving, leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, operating a vehicle under the influence of liquor (second offense) and driving to endanger.
 The two motor vehicle charges are due to two separate theories of the charge.
 The name of the victim was not released. Connolly said the district attorney's office is waiting for confirmation that the next of kin has been notified.
 Latraverse was arraigned via speaker phone on Monday. Milford District Court Judge Robert Calagione released Latraverse without bail. Latraverse is due back in court next Monday to address the conditions of his release.
 The fatal crash occurred while police were at another crash scene. That crash on South Main Street near 126 Scott Hill Blvd., occurred Friday afternoon and involved a police cruiser. No one was injured but the road was closed as part of the investigation and drivers were asked to take detours.

 The media is most definitely not your enemy.
 Far from being the enemy of the people, day in and day out we take our role as the Fourth Estate seriously and work hard to protect your right to know, making public records requests and attending public meetings to keep you informed.
 Why?
 Because we believe all the business government does, whether in open public meetings or behind closed doors, is your business.
 We believe every last penny government spends is your money.
 We believe it is your right to know every transaction, every decision, every expenditure and every deliberation of your government.
 Whether talking about the White House, the statehouse or the county courthouse, all the documents held in government halls belong to the people, and all the business conducted by our governors is public business.
 We believe our government -- your government -- can only be of, by and for the people when it is out in front of the people.
 Primary to our republic is the understanding that we are the government and the government is us.
 The only powers held by federal, state or local government are the powers we give.
 So, whether it is Congress, the state government, county and municipal government, or the board of education, it is your right to know all of the people's business.
 When you attend local city, county, municipal or school board meetings, and ask questions and hold elected representatives accountable, you are not minding their business, you are minding your own business.
 When you make a public records request, you are not asking local records custodians to give you something that just belongs to them or the office where they work. You are simply asking for your own documents.
 The Bill of Rights, specifically the First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, is not intended to protect the media per se. Rather, the founders built a hedge of protection around the media because the media guards and fights for the public's right to know.
 According to a Brookings Institution report, more than 2,000 newspapers across the country ceased publication in the last 15 years or so. The shuttering of newspapers presents a very real and present danger to our most basic freedoms. That's why, as we acknowledge Sunshine Week this week, communities should support their local newspapers, through subscriptions and advertising, now more than ever before.
 Journalists keep an eye on government, shine the light on its actions, fight the good fight for access to documents and meetings, champion transparency, and defend the First Amendment because of a core belief in your basic, fundamental rights -- principally, your right to know.

“This is an unprecedented situation that has confronted us,” said House Speaker David Ralston.
 The House and Senate quickly realized they weren't on the same page about the declaration that open up all state resources to fight the spread of COVID-19.
 “I guess something changed last night,” Rep. Erick Allen, D-Smyrna, told CBS46.
 The House’s version called for lawmakers to return to the Capitol in 30 days to approve any possible extension on the emergency declaration. The Senate’s version would give the governor authority to renew it on his own without lawmakers re-ratifying. That key difference sent lawmakers into nearly 8 hours of debate.
 “I believe that in 30 days, if we need to continue and renew the emergency, then the legislative branch is more than capable, as we did today, of coming back in and doing the people’s work,” Allen explained.

It was a weekend afternoon, and perfect spring weather for a family walk.
 As we turned the corner on Claiborne Avenue, my 2-year-old son looked out from his plastic blue car and saw something familiar. The exterior of Tulane’s Turchin Stadium.
 There’s a fence covered in green awning and pictures of its Angry Wave mascot, placed a few feet in front the outfield wall, and the stadium seats in the background. He was accustomed to this walk by now.
 “Go to baseball game with daddy!,” he yelped excitedly in a way only a toddler can.
 I stayed quiet.
 “Go to baseball game with daddy!,” he shouted a few more times as we kept walking the block, about to turn away from the stadium to continue the weekend’s first outing beyond the confines of home.
 When we finally turned away from Claiborne, those bursts of excitement became wails of sorrow.
 “Go to baseball game with daddy!,” was now a full-throated, face-squinched, whine before morphing into prolonged crying.
 And I get it. It’s where he eats nachos with his grandfather, dances to music and yells “hit it to the ground” at random, inexplicable times.
 Does he know what’s really happening on the field? Of course not. He was too young to realize Tulane hit a game-winning home run to beat Middle Tennessee, but laughed as everyone stood, shouted and applauded.
 But, this time, there was no baseball game to attend. In fact, none of us know when any game, of any kind, is going to be played again.
 Everything has ground to a halt. From the NBA to the PGA, NASCAR to college baseball, all of the stuff that used to occupy a piece of the national fabric and serve as a tether between generations has been temporarily severed.
 And while I wasn’t nearly as expressive as the 2-year old in a plastic car, I felt exactly what he was experiencing in that moment. As league after league shut its doors indefinitely, it became difficult to maintain perspective.
 Yes, they were doing what’s right. Social distancing is paramount in the fight to flatten the curve of Coronavirus and stay within the capacity of our healthcare system.
 Not allowing in fans isn’t enough. Players, coaches, and camera operators are in danger as well.
 But, it’s OK to recognize the emptiness that comes when the games we count on are gone. When something so routine gets ripped away in an instant, it takes a few moments to recognize what just happened.
 Because, in many ways, we need sports now more than ever.
 In the midst of a national health crisis and the endless churn of a depressing, debilitating and dreary news cycle, our sports aren’t there to play their usual role.
 A distraction. A galvanizing force. A conversation topic.
 Something to provide an emotional investment without the stakes of life, death, security and freedom on the line. And, you know, a little fun.
 Sure, sports are trivial and far too tribal, but without them, we have to go it alone over these next few months. In a society of push notifications and social media scrolling, the crushing monotony of rising COVID-19 cases and uneven government response is enough to break someone’s spirit.
 You’re not supposed to be surrounded by friends and community members in public places. And even contact with loved ones could cause unintended harm.
 So, where do we turn as a collective?
 Individually, we can each find our favorite streaming service and binge watch some television series and movies (or in my case, 50 years’ worth of Sesame Street). And there’s never been better communication tools, allowing us to FaceTime friends and work remotely without a hitch.
 But, unlike other national tragedies, sports isn’t here to bring us together. Not this time.
 A reliable societal link is just gone. We’ve never experienced anything like this before.
 The NBA is planning at least a 90-day hiatus. The Masters is delayed. March Madness evaporated into thin air.
 These are more than just entertainment items. They’re part of the country’s connective tissue, and some common ground between you and the next person standing in line or the postman walking the street.
 And for some, it’s just an opportunity to eat nachos in the sun with your dad.
 When the games eventually come back, we’ll cherish them at first and eventually they’ll make their way back into mundanity. As all things do.
 But, the image of a 2-year old flipping from ecstasy to agony as the ballpark faded from view will always remind me about what sports can mean, and how precious they can be.

Warriors boss Cameron George has revealed they have created a hit list of players that could be taken on loan in a bid to remain in this year's NRL competition.
 The Warriors' status for the rest of the season is unclear due to strict travel restrictions in New Zealand and Australia as a result of coronavirus.
 The NRL has already begun contingency plans should the Warriors be unable to participate in the NRL after this week's round-two match against Canberra.
 However, it is understood the league is considering the radical idea of loaning players from rival clubs too in a desperate attempt to fulfil broadcast obligations.
 "We've got a hit list," George told reporters on Tuesday.
 "So we have been talking to a couple of clubs about some players that might be available under the circumstances and how that would look, for how long.
 "But it's a real possibility given the restrictions of travel.
 "We can't get people in there. There's a real option for us to look at, it's just working out who and where from."
 The NRL has already given the green light for the Warriors to use their development players, five of whom are already with the playing group in Kingscliff.
 Peta Hiku and Patrick Herbert, both of whom played in their round-one loss to Newcastle, are unavailable after returning home for personal reasons.
 Their absence has left coach Stephen Kearney with just 24 players available to face the Raiders at Cbus Super Stadium on Saturday.
 It remains unclear if the Warriors will return home after the match.
 Under newly-introduced policies, all international arrivals in New Zealand and Australia must self-quarantine for a fortnight.
 George admitted that while some clubs were sympathetic to their predicament he wasn't expecting rivals to offer some of their stronger players.
 In the Warriors' favour is the possible suspension of reserve-grade competitions in both NSW and Queensland.
 NSW Rugby League officials are believed to be in discussions about whether to continue with their seasons due to the pandemic threat.
 The Warriors' NSW Cup team has already returned home after last week's opening round and is all but certain to be left out of the competition.
 A decision is likely to be made by Wednesday.
 Players with first-grade experience who appeared in the NSW Cup last week include Tautau Moga, Mason Lino, Matt Burton and Drew Hutchison.
 Jai Field, Will Smith, Daniel Alvaro, Ofahiki Ogden, Sauaso Sue, Chris McQueen, Matt Eisenhuth, Jack Johns and Jayson Bukuya also featured in reserve grade.
 "It's a difficult one because if you're a club and you're happy to help out you're not going to throw anyone out of your top bunch at us," George said.
 "The players we'll be dealing with will be ones on the fringe not playing NRL.

Having a high-end telescope can be a dream come true for any astronomy lover, but you do not have to go all out and break the bank to enjoy your new hobby. Binoculars make for an awesome substitute for beginners, and they are cheaper as well, so it is a win-win situation! Opt for binoculars that spot large front lenses and high optical quality for better viewing. When you are ready for more advanced gadgets, consider getting a high-end telescope. Buying a telescope is a huge investment, though, so make sure to read reviews and compare prices to get the best value for money. Generally, you need a light telescope that you can carry easily. Getting a telescope that sports a big aperture can be tempting, but as a beginner, you should worry more about accessibility. There are also models with built-in computers and motors that can help you spot celestial bodies more easily, which can be a good option if you are willing to splurge on your new telescope.

 Social distancing makes all the sense in the world in the pivotal early stage of a fast-moving outbreak like this coronavirus. We must prevent our hospitals and ICUs from being overwhelmed as Italy's currently are, not only for those struggling with this particular bug, but also for all others who depend upon them.
 We need to flatten the curve. We don't want infections growing exponentially so that large numbers of vulnerable people get infected and some fraction of those people die.
 What I do not understand -- and I'm worried nobody has thoroughly thought through -- is how long we're supposed to cancel mass gatherings, keep museums closed and the like, and what any of this has to do with the progress of the pandemic.
 Yes, there's a possibility that we get rescued by the weather. Warmer weather makes it harder for some viruses to thrive. There's a possibility a vaccine comes online sooner than any medical professionals anticipate, which is a year or 18 months at the soonest.
 But setting those possibilities aside for a moment, consider a few scenarios:
 -- Confirmed cases and deaths spike. The big fear is that we've already passed some tipping point, and that the trend line of cases and fatalities now keeps going sharply up. (This is likely to happen in the near term in the United States if only because testing, which has been outrageously rare, will ramp up, revealing previously unknown cases and driving numbers higher.) Suppose in a week a so, there are verified infections in the tens of thousands and many hundreds of deaths in the country. Suppose in a month there are hundreds of thousands of infections and many thousand deaths.
 If the current rush to substantially slow the pace of the outbreak patently fails, in other words, will that mean continued social distancing or even more drastic measures are imperative, or will it mean the virus will at some point be widespread enough that there's no point in trying to hold back the floodgates any longer? My guess is the former, meaning if it doesn't work, we must hunker down and do more of it.
 -- Confirmed cases and deaths plateau. The hope is that cancellations and self-quarantining have a real impact. Within a matter of weeks, the number of new cases starts to taper off, and so do the number of fatalities.
 Will a highly successful containment campaign mean we are out of the woods and can relent in our vigilance, or will it mean we must keep everything closed and canceled lest we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory? My guess is the latter, meaning if it works, we will have a strong reason to keep doing it.
 -- Confirmed cases and deaths go up, but not as fast as expected. A third scenario would be a muddle, where we can't confirm whether social distancing and cancellation of mass gatherings are having the desired effect. They're doing some good, but not enough.
 Will that argue for keeping it going for additional weeks and months, or reverting back to something closer to the old normal? My guess is a mixed record will argue for an escalated effort to isolate those with the virus.
 In other words, we may be entering a stage in which, given our expectations and goals, no matter what the results of our prophylactic measures are, we have to dig in our heels for fear of unleashing the worst. And ironically, the strongest ultimate case for relaxing the restrictions may be the scenario in which cases have spiked sharply, making extraordinary measures to hold back its spread futile.
 Or am I wrong? I hope I'm wrong.

Wednesday looks like a decent weather day with good sunshine and a light breeze as high pressure builds. Temperatures should return to near and slightly above normal.
 Our next storm gets going late Wednesday night into Thursday morning. With surface high pressure moving to our northeast, the air should be cold enough for some snow or ice in the hilltowns, but it depends on how quickly precip moves in. There is potential for some snow accumulation in the high terrain Thursday morning.
 Thursday will be cool and damp with continued rain showers throughout the day as temperatures climb into the 40s. Temps will hover in the 40s Thursday night and jump into the 60s Friday ahead of a strong cold front. Showers will be on and off Friday with lots of clouds and a gusty southwest breeze. Behind a cold front, rain will end late Friday night. Skies clear out Saturday and we turn dry and chilly for the weekend.

The global spread of the virus has hammered world trade, supply chains and tourism, dealing a heavy blow to Japan's fragile economy, which is teetering on the edge of a recession.
 The souring business mood could derail capital spending, one of the few bright spots in the economy. That will heap pressure on the government and the central bank to deploy more stimulus measures.
 The BOJ eased monetary policy on Monday by pledging to buy riskier assets such as exchange-traded funds at double the current pace, joining global central banks in combating the widening economic fallout from the epidemic.
 All manufacturers across industries were pessimistic about business conditions, according to the Reuters poll of 501 large and midsize nonfinancial companies, of which 242 firms responded on condition of anonymity.
 Among service sector firms, no firms except those in real estate/construction and information/communications were optimistic.
 Most of the companies expressed fears of the virus's impact on their business, on top of already weak consumer spending due to the October sales tax hike and sluggish global demand aggravated by the U.S.-China trade war.
 "We cannot see how much impact the virus may have on our business in March. We fear sharp drops in sales," a manager at a chemicals firm wrote in the survey.
 A machinery-maker manager said, "Just as the U.S.-China trade friction seems to be settled for the time being, the new virus is causing worry about downward revision to our profits."
 The sentiment index at manufacturers fell to minus 20 in March from minus 5 in the previous month, while the service sector gauge dropped 25 points to minus 10, the Reuters Tankan poll showed. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.
 The manufacturers index hit the lowest since December 2009, the depths of the global financial crisis.
 Nonmanufacturers were the most pessimistic since June 2011 in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
 Manufacturers expected to be even more glum in three months' time, with the index seen falling further to minus 25 in June, while service-sector morale was seen unchanged in June.
 The BOJ's December tankan showed big manufacturers' mood hit a near seven-year low in the fourth quarter, as the Sino-U.S. trade war curbed external demand and the October national sales tax hike to 10 percent from 8 percent dealt a blow to consumer demand.
 Japan's economy, the world's third largest, shrank at a 7.1 percent annualized rate in October to December, and many economists see another contraction in the current period, which would spell a technical recession — or two straight quarters of negative growth.

Social distancing makes all the sense in the world in the pivotal early stage of a fast-moving outbreak like this coronavirus. We must prevent our hospitals and ICUs from being overwhelmed as Italy's currently are, not only for those struggling with this particular bug, but also for all others who depend upon them.
   
 We need to flatten the curve. We don't want infections growing exponentially so that large numbers of vulnerable people get infected and some fraction of those people die.
   
 What I do not understand -- and I'm worried nobody has thoroughly thought through -- is how long we're supposed to cancel mass gatherings, keep museums closed and the like, and what any of this has to do with the progress of the pandemic.
   
 Yes, there's a possibility that we get rescued by the weather. Warmer weather makes it harder for some viruses to thrive. There's a possibility a vaccine comes online sooner than any medical professionals anticipate, which is a year or 18 months at the soonest.
   
 But setting those possibilities aside for a moment, consider a few scenarios:
   
 -- Confirmed cases and deaths spike. The big fear is that we've already passed some tipping point, and that the trend line of cases and fatalities now keeps going sharply up. (This is likely to happen in the near term in the United States if only because testing, which has been outrageously rare, will ramp up, revealing previously unknown cases and driving numbers higher.) Suppose in a week a so, there are verified infections in the tens of thousands and many hundreds of deaths in the country. Suppose in a month there are hundreds of thousands of infections and many thousand deaths.
   
 If the current rush to substantially slow the pace of the outbreak patently fails, in other words, will that mean continued social distancing or even more drastic measures are imperative, or will it mean the virus will at some point be widespread enough that there's no point in trying to hold back the floodgates any longer? My guess is the former, meaning if it doesn't work, we must hunker down and do more of it.
   
 -- Confirmed cases and deaths plateau. The hope is that cancellations and self-quarantining have a real impact. Within a matter of weeks, the number of new cases starts to taper off, and so do the number of fatalities.
   
 Will a highly successful containment campaign mean we are out of the woods and can relent in our vigilance, or will it mean we must keep everything closed and canceled lest we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory? My guess is the latter, meaning if it works, we will have a strong reason to keep doing it.
   
 -- Confirmed cases and deaths go up, but not as fast as expected. A third scenario would be a muddle, where we can't confirm whether social distancing and cancellation of mass gatherings are having the desired effect. They're doing some good, but not enough.
   
 Will that argue for keeping it going for additional weeks and months, or reverting back to something closer to the old normal? My guess is a mixed record will argue for an escalated effort to isolate those with the virus.
   
 In other words, we may be entering a stage in which, given our expectations and goals, no matter what the results of our prophylactic measures are, we have to dig in our heels for fear of unleashing the worst. And ironically, the strongest ultimate case for relaxing the restrictions may be the scenario in which cases have spiked sharply, making extraordinary measures to hold back its spread futile.
   
 Or am I wrong? I hope I'm wrong.

Republicans often reluctant to spend federal dollars did not flinch at the head-spinning number, as a roster of America's big and small industries — airlines, hotels, retailers — lined up for aid.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he wants a "comprehensive" approach with "significant steps" for the economy, particularly Main Street businesses. He opened the Senate on Monday with a message to Americans: "The Senate stands with you."
 The rush to inject an infusion of cash and resources into the economy is an effort unlike any since the 2008 economic crisis, with political and economic interventions and eye-popping sums to try to protect Americans from the health and financial fallout.
 Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called for sending $1,000 to every American.
 Senators returned to an emptied out U.S. Capitol, clear of tourists or colleagues from the House, to confront an even more dire situation than the one they left for a long weekend, before Trump declared a national emergency.
 Pending is the House-passed aid package approved early Saturday — with sick pay, free testing and emergency food — that is endorsed by President Donald Trump and ready to become law.
 But it's stalled, for now, as the Senate waits on the House for technical corrections, while navigating its own problems, as some Republican senators panning the package want changes.
 All sides — the House, Senate and White House — agree the pending bill is not the last and not nearly enough to handle what's coming. At the start of the month Congress approved $8.3 billion in initial aid. Trump quickly signed into law the measure, which provided federal agencies money for vaccines, tests and potential treatments, and to help state and local governments respond to the threat.
 Schumer floated the Democrats' proposal for at least $750 billion to boost hospital capacity, unemployment insurance and other direct aid for American households, businesses and the health care industry. Republican senators were conferring privately over their priorities.
 The days ahead will test if Congress can quickly respond to the crisis.
 Industries representing a broad swath of the economy are seeking help in withstanding the fallout as schools close and Americans are being told to stay inside, skip nonessential travel and avoid gatherings with 10 people or more.
 That means no dining out, no boarding planes, no shopping the malls as a great national shutdown sparks business closures, layoffs and lost paychecks for rents, mortgages and everyday needs.
 The nation's largest business organization, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, asked the Trump administration and Congress on Monday to act rapidly to help companies have access to cash and avert a "potentially devastating" hit to the economy.
 The request from the U.S. airlines alone could easily top $50 billion, according to Airlines for America, the trade group representing the carriers.
 "We're going to back the airlines 100%," Trump said at a White House briefing. "We've told the airlines we're going to help them."
 In a letter to Trump and congressional leaders, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called for legislation including a three-month cancellation of the taxes companies pay to support Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance.
 "No family and no business should go bankrupt just because of the temporary disruption in income caused by the coronavirus," said the chamber's CEO, Thomas J. Donohue.
 The nation's governors were also calling on Congress to swiftly bring economic aid, particularly for the unemployment insurance system to help displaced workers, and fast.
 "We need a better response from the federal government," said Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat. "I am out of patience."
 Pulling together the new package will challenge the basic logistics of governing as the Congress itself struggled to adapt to the new normal.
 House Democrats were told on a conference call they won't be recalled to Washington until the next package is ready for action, according to people familiar with the call but unauthorized to discuss it and granted anonymity.
 The 100-member Senate convened for an evening vote — a potentially stunning sight of people gathered. While different authorities around the country have issued conflicting advice, the government said at a Monday news conference that Americans should not gather in groups of more than 10 people over the next 15 days.
 The No. 2 Senate Democratic leader, Dick Durbin of Illinois, counting the number of senators on the floor, questioned what example they were setting. He urged swift passage of the House package. "What are we waiting for?" he said.
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.
 The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
 Despite Trump's robust support, a handful of Republicans were saying they wanted to make changes in the measure. "It doesn't go far enough," said Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark.
 In addition, the National Federation of Independent Business, which counts hundreds of thousands of small-business members, opposed it.

As Congress eyes economic package, Democrats seek $750B
 By LISA MASCARO and ALAN FRAM Associated Press
 WASHINGTON (AP) — With an urgency unseen since the Great Recession, Congress is rushing to develop a sweeping economic lifeline for American households and businesses suddenly capsized by the coronavirus outbreak.
 Democrats said at least $750 billion would be needed.
 "We will need big, bold, urgent federal action to deal with this crisis," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.
 Republicans often reluctant to spend federal dollars did not flinch at the head-spinning number, as a roster of America's big and small industries — airlines, hotels, retailers — lined up for aid.

 BELLINGHAM - A Bellingham man was drunk when he struck and killed a person with his car on Center Street on Friday before fleeing the scene, authorities said.
 Police arrested Richard Latraverse, 73, after the crash, Worcester county District Attorney spokesman Timothy Connolly said on Monday.
 The time of the incident was not available. Authorities said Latraverse was driving his car when he struck the victim and then drove off. Latraverse returned to the scene and later identified himself, authorities said.
 Police arrested Latraverse, whose address was not available, and charged him with two counts of motor vehicle homicide by negligent operation and drunken driving, leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, operating a vehicle under the influence of liquor (second offense) and driving to endanger.
 The two motor vehicle charges are due to two separate theories of the charge.
 The name of the victim was not released. Connolly said the district attorney's office is waiting for confirmation that the next of kin has been notified.
 Latraverse was arraigned via speaker phone on Monday. Milford District Court Judge Robert Calagione released Latraverse without bail. Latraverse is due back in court next Monday to address the conditions of his release.
 The fatal crash occurred while police were at another crash scene. That crash on South Main Street near 126 Scott Hill Blvd., occurred Friday afternoon and involved a police cruiser. No one was injured but the road was closed as part of the investigation and drivers were asked to take detours.

npr, agreed. The best way to go about this is to turn the situation around, and use what we call "universal precautions" whenever handling a sample of human origin. That is to say, treat _every_ sample in the lab as if it is potentially infectious. Therefore, treat anyone you encounter the same way. Do not touch any surface that anyone who is infectious may have touched. If you do touch such a surface, wash your hands ASAP, and do not touch your face before doing so. Keep a distance from others if you possibly can.

Thurmont police charged a man with attempted murder after they said he attacked another man with a machete during an altercation late Friday.
 Robin Ray Spahr, 62, of the 7600 block of Willow Road in Frederick, was taken into custody at a motel room at that address early Saturday after police responded to an address in the 200 block of North Church Street in Thurmont to find a man suffering from several deep cuts to his hands, arms, head, neck and back, according to court charging documents.
 The injured man was rushed to Meritus Medical Center, where he provided police with information that led them to Spahr and another possible witness to the assault.
 Spahr told officers that he was defending himself after the injured man came at him with a shovel. Spahr had only two small cuts on his right hand and a minor cut on his left. A machete believed to have been used in the assault was found in Spahr’s truck, the documents state.
 The injured person, a 58-year-old Thurmont man, suffered a cut in his skull along with other wounds consistent with having been attacked with a machete, the documents state. He was treated at the medical center and released over the weekend, according to a Thurmont police press release issued Monday.
 Spahr was charged with attempted second-degree murder, first- and second- degree assault, and reckless endangerment, according to court records. He was denied bail at an initial appearance before a District Court commissioner.
 At a bail review hearing for Spahr held Monday afternoon in Frederick County District Court, Assistant Public Defender Christina Moehrle argued that her client’s actions were in self-defense, pointing out that Spahr told police that the other man had attacked him with a shovel.
 “It is our position that the defendant was in a defensive position,” Moehrle told Judge Dino E. Flores at the hearing.
 Flores eventually sided with Assistant State’s Attorney Rebecca Clinton, who had urged the judge to deny Spahr the opportunity to post bail, citing a threat to public safety.
 In explaining his decision, Flores said that the violent offenses, as well as the differences in the injuries suffered by Spahr and the other man, seemed to undercut Spahr’s contention that he was defending himself.

The media is most definitely not your enemy.
   
 Far from being the enemy of the people, day in and day out we take our role as the Fourth Estate seriously and work hard to protect your right to know, making public records requests and attending public meetings to keep you informed.
   
 Why?
   
 Because we believe all the business government does, whether in open public meetings or behind closed doors, is your business.
   
 We believe every last penny government spends is your money.
   
 We believe it is your right to know every transaction, every decision, every expenditure and every deliberation of your government.
   
 Whether talking about the White House, the statehouse or the county courthouse, all the documents held in government halls belong to the people, and all the business conducted by our governors is public business.
   
 We believe our government -- your government -- can only be of, by and for the people when it is out in front of the people.
   
 Primary to our republic is the understanding that we are the government and the government is us.
   
 The only powers held by federal, state or local government are the powers we give.
   
 So, whether it is Congress, the state government, county and municipal government, or the board of education, it is your right to know all of the people's business.
   
 When you attend local city, county, municipal or school board meetings, and ask questions and hold elected representatives accountable, you are not minding their business, you are minding your own business.
   
 When you make a public records request, you are not asking local records custodians to give you something that just belongs to them or the office where they work. You are simply asking for your own documents.
   
 The Bill of Rights, specifically the First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, is not intended to protect the media per se. Rather, the founders built a hedge of protection around the media because the media guards and fights for the public's right to know.
   
 According to a Brookings Institution report, more than 2,000 newspapers across the country ceased publication in the last 15 years or so. The shuttering of newspapers presents a very real and present danger to our most basic freedoms. That's why, as we acknowledge Sunshine Week this week, communities should support their local newspapers, through subscriptions and advertising, now more than ever before.
   
 Journalists keep an eye on government, shine the light on its actions, fight the good fight for access to documents and meetings, champion transparency, and defend the First Amendment because of a core belief in your basic, fundamental rights -- principally, your right to know.

"In the past two weeks, the number of cases of COVID-19 outside China has increased 13-fold, and the number of affected countries has tripled.      There are now more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries, and 4,291 people have lost their lives.      Thousands more are fighting for their lives in hospitals. In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected countries climb even higher.      WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.
