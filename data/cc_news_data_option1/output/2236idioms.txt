A Lebanon man accused of murdering two people has been scheduled for an 11-day jury trial to begin on Feb. 4, 2021, according to Oregon’s online court database.
 Brenton Wade Richmond, 50, is charged with four counts of aggravated murder and one charge of burglary for the shooting deaths of Tammy Hopper and Erik Jacobs in Lebanon.
 The trial was scheduled during a hearing on May 27.
 On that date, Judge David Delsman also denied a motion by the defense to limit and exclude autopsy and crime scene digital photographs from evidence.
 Hopper and Jacobs were dating and they were killed in Hopper’s Lebanon home in the 200 block of Shannon Place on or about Feb. 7, 2019.
 Richmond, a former Lebanon Police Department officer, was Hopper’s ex- boyfriend. The two had dated on and off for about nine years. About two weeks prior, Richmond had threatened to kill Hopper and any man she was dating, according to court paperwork.

The Himachal Pradesh BJP legistlature party will meet in Shimla on Wednesday to decide on the successor of Rajeev Bindal, who resigned as state unit chief after his name surfaced in the health department scam recently.
 Convened by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, the meeting at the government-run Peterhoff Hotel will chalk out the government and party's strategy to neutralise opposition Congress's escalating attack in the scam.
 Thakur, who heads the legislature party, also holds the health portfolio.
 The department came under a cloud last month when the then director, health services, Dr Ajay Kumar Gupta was caught on audio tape demanding a bribe of Rs 5 lakh from Prithvi Singh, the representative of a supplier of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the state's corona frontline workers. The scam led to state BJP chief Rajeev Bindal stepping down on moral grounds due to his proximity with Dr Gupta and to ensure a fair probe.
 CONGRESS SHARPENS ATTACK
 The development gave the opposition Congress a tool to hit out at the ruling party and demand a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that too at a time when then state government is grappling to contain the spread of coronavirus.
 "State BJP president Rajeev Bindal resigned after Dr Gupta's arrest in the health scam. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who is at the helm, should have quit before Bindal. The government should clarify on the circumstances that led to Bindal's quitting," said leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri.
 After attending the party's virtual rally at the state BJP office, Deep Kamal, members of the legislature party are expected to come up with a consensus candidate to take over as state Bharatiya Janata Party chief.
 Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and the chief minister will address BJP workers virtually amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
 State BJP chief spokesman Randhir Sharma, the chief minister's political adviser and party general secretary Trilok Jamwal, Sundernagar legislator Rakesh Jamwal, Kangra Co-operative Bank chairman Rajeev Bhardwaj and party general secretary Ram Singh are frontrunners for the post.
 TWO CABINET BERTHS VACANT
 The party is expected to discuss the cabinet expansion since two berths are vacant after food minister Kishan Kapoor was elected to the Lok Sabha and power minister Anil Sharma quit before last year's parliamentary elections. The Congress had allotted the party ticket to his son Asheray Sharma from Mandi.
 The names of Nurpur legislator Rakesh Pathania and Paonta Sahib MLA Sukhram Chaudhary are doing the rounds for inclusion in the cabinet.
 Intra-party squabbles have also become a cause of concern for the ruling party with supporters of former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal stepping up activities in the politically sensitive Kangra district. Former irrigation and public health minister Ravinder Singh Ravi, Kangra Lok Sabha member Kishan Kapoor, former legislator Sanay Chaudhary and party leaders Ranvir Singh Nikka, Nirmal Singh, and Ghanshyam Sharma held closed-door meetings in Dharamshala recently much to the discomfort of Jai Ram Thakur.

A few weeks ago, I remembered an old English professor, Roy Male, and his remarkably accurate theory of pianos in drama.
 If you go into a theater to see a play and there’s a piano on the stage, Male taught me, before the evening is over, someone will play the piano. So far, he’s always been right.
 Another valuable life lesson that Male taught — all for the amazingly affordable price of 1980s state university tuition — concerned vocations, airplanes and grammar.

Hard problems require tough solutions, and in the case of decades of tension between minority communities and police departments, the remedy requires all of us to acknowledge that the problem is more pervasive than the transgressions of a few bad apples.
   
 The bad apples narrative, while true in specific incidents, doesn't allow for the necessary introspection that propels broader reform.
   
 Just to be clear, police officers have one of the toughest jobs, and those who do their jobs with respect and dignity deserve our esteem and support for their dedication to public service.
   
 But consider this disquieting statistic. According to a Brookings Institution essay, African Americans are 3.5 times more likely than white counterparts to be killed by police when they are not attacking or don't have a weapon. Think about that. Lethal force is more likely to be used against African Americans even when they don't pose a threat. It is for that reason that African American parents have the "talk" with their children, especially male teenagers, about the unpredictability of police encounters.
   
 This is a cold statistic, not a mushy bad apples narrative. The awkward conclusion is that the color of one's skin is a determining factor in many police stops, use of force and arrests. To our mind that signals a systemic problem that firing a few bad apples wouldn't resolve.
   
 For example, federal investigations during the Obama administration into police practices after high-profile incidents in Baltimore, Cleveland, New Orleans, Chicago and Ferguson, Mo., all found massive structural and cultural problems that extend beyond the officers in a particular case. In Baltimore, the report concluded that racial disparities existed "at every stage of BPD's enforcement actions, from the initial decision to stop individuals on Baltimore streets to searches, arrests, and uses of force." And this was after controlling for population and crime rates.
   
 The death of George Floyd is an appropriate time for departments everywhere to reflect and reassess. Effective policing is a two-way street. It requires community trust and support as well as officers who work to earn it.
   
 This is not the time to excuse or accuse. This is the time to look into police department practices and revise practices that adversely or unjustly impact communities that officers have sworn to protect.
   
 Every department should be reviewing officer training and tactics, with special attention to how to de-escalate situations and understanding implicit biases that everyone has. And police officers who patrol the right way also must be willing to break the thin blue line that too often has protected officers who should not have a badge or a gun. And this review should not be one-and-done in response to Floyd's death. It should be standard operating procedure. It's the morally right thing to do and might also prevent cities from paying settlements for wrongful death or civil rights violations.
   
 Police officers have the power of life and death and must understand that their actions in extreme circumstances can be charged as murder. Only recently have we seen police officers charged with murder, and three of those cases occurred in North Texas. Botham Jean and Atatiana Jefferson were shot and killed inside their homes and Jordan Edwards died when a police officer fired at a vehicle he was in.
   
 The moment and the opportunity to reform is before us. If we fail to seize it, we will regret it for generations.

Desperate Housewives will end after seven seasons, said series creator and executive producer Marc Cherry.
 The show’s fifth season bows Sept. 28.
 Perhaps taking a cue from fellow ABC show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse who earlier this year set an end date for Lost, Cherry said he will wrap up the show that helped to put ABC back into contention.
 “After seven seasons I will probably keel over in a lump and die,” said Cherry, adding that the notion of having a new show runner take over his “baby” is out of the question.
 “I’m going to take it through seven years and we’re going to get out when people still like us.”
 Of course, added Cherry, “this could be some clever ruse on my part to get some tremendous amount of money for season eight.”

GENESEO-- After the major success of the last flyover in the Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse areas, there was a strong desire to take to the friendly skies of Upstate New York once more.
   
 The last "Operation Thank You From Above" was about a six-hour flight and took on around 100 locations. It came about organically as a way to pay tribute to all the frontline workers in the COVID-19 pandemic. Afterwards, there was an outpouring of admiration about the event and a need for a second flyover in the Southern Tier.
   
 The National Warplane Museum and OneCore Aviation teamed up to bring this event to millions of hearts across the nation via media platforms. Whiskey 7 is the most beloved plane of the museum, but for one day she was the most tracked plane in the world. This plane is a powerful message for all veterans, and now frontline workers, of hope in the battlefield. Having survived the Invasion of Normandy, this WWII warplane celebrated its 76th Anniversary on June 6 by saying thank you to all the health care workers, first responders, and essential workers who have kept society safe during COVID-19. The P-51 Mustang "Mad Max" joined Whiskey 7 out of Dunkirk for this special honor. Both warplanes were in World War II.
   
 Austin Wadsworth, NWM President, said the thank you flight had been so well received that they had to do a second one, which passed over Hornell, Wellsville and many locations across the region.
   
 "This was a real powerful message for the people. It wasn't a military jet that passes by in a few seconds. It wasn't a military team that put this together. It was a few people who wanted to bring this together and make a difference. I have heard that lots of people really appreciated our efforts. We wanted to honor the hospital workers this time," he said.
   
 Todd Cameron, of OneCore Aviation, was the one who spearheaded this entire event. He said the first flight was the longest flyover in the country during this COVID-19 crisis. When you put both flights together it is even more impressive. The second flight is 65 locations. It was about a four-hour flight.
   
 "The Mad Max has a very unique sound to it. When people hear that plane fly over, they will know it is coming for miles away. We are down here working on these planes all year. It is nice for us to be able to do something like this. The Whiskey 7 is my favorite plane. We get to take her out on D-Day to honor the frontline workers. On the 76-year Anniversary when we had young paratroopers jumping out of her on the beaches of Normandy, now, they are in their 90s and can see it fly from above," he said.
   
 Chris Polhemus flew Whiskey 7 on the 70-year Anniversary in 2014. He said it was 25 hours across the North Atlantic Ocean in the old warplane. They used the old routes and ways of navigation.
   
 "I was part of the first thank you flyover. It was a very nice event. It was well received by so many people. It was all about the frontline workers who have been hit nonstop by this crisis, so it was a nice tribute for them," he said.
   
 Rob Gillman had joined the museum in 1981 and has made it a second home ever since. He would fly some of the old warplanes with his WWII veteran father who taught him all he knows about flying. His father flew the planes in the war and taught him how to fly the old way when he was 16-years-old.
   
 "It was really gratifying to look down. You get so busy flying that you don't get to see the people looking up at you. It was important for me to keep sight of what I was doing in this mission. I got to sneak a few looks at what the mission was about. We are thanking the health care workers and first responders. We are accomplishing the same thing in the second flight," he said. "We are starting to come to the end of a long war. This COVID-19 crisis has been a long battle for our frontline workers. They all got caught up in the middle of this war. We want to treat them the same way we treat veterans. We don't want them to be forgotten. We want people to remember what they did. We see this kind of thing all the time in combat."
   
 Gillman said he has passed down what his father taught him to the other guys at the museum. He has trained a lot of the other pilots. He flew with his father for about eight years on those old warplanes. They watched the museum go from a grassroots project to the powerful message it is to so many today.
   
 "I was thanked personally by some people for the first flyover. When we came back for the afternoon flyover in Syracuse it was so clear on the Ontario Lake. I could see across it to Canada. We had such a beautiful view on that lake. It is a worthwhile event for all of us. We have had guys spend countless hours and days on the routes and putting this whole thing together so that it all runs smoothly."
   
 Peter Treichler is another one of the pilots who was able to bring his family to camp at the museum while he got ready for the event. Ruben Alconero was the last pilot to be part of the event. He has been at the museum awhile as well.
   
 Bob Howard and Brian Trzaskos were the flight crew on this thank you flight. They were making sure Whiskey 7 was oiled and gassed for the training.
   
 WWII Paratrooper Leslie Cruise Jr. of the 82nd Airborne was on the famous 70-year Anniversary D-Day Normandy Flight. He had come back to the museum a couple years ago to make his mark on the very plane he jumped out of when he was just a young paratrooper on the beaches of Normandy. His signature remains part of the Whiskey 7 story for many years to come. It reminds those who visit the museum that these young men fought for our freedom so far away from home, and we must honor that memory and sacrifice every day.

"I'm not one for the dramatic." So says Elisabeth Moss in her Bette Davis-lite portrayal of author Shirley Jackson in the starkly titled "Shirley." That statement is ironic since most of Josephine Decker's follow-up to 2018's "Madeline's Madeline" is a succession of actorly hysterics in service of a Gothic soap opera brimming with lesbian undertones.
 Men! Who needs them? That's the theme driving a script by Sarah Gubbins (TV's "I Love Dick") in which she converts Susan Scarf Merrell's like-titled novel into a dull, plodding fever dream of fact cut with a steady dose of fiction. Yet, her protofeminist approach peculiarly carries as much disdain for her female characters as it does for the feckless, unfaithful men they "love."
 So, what's to like? I'm still kicking that around in my head. Is my ho-hum reaction to "Shirley" due to the underwhelming narrative or the fact that Decker is that rare director whose status as a critical favorite utterly escapes me, a list she's joined on by Benh Zeitlin ("Beasts of the Southern Wild") and Luca Guadagnino ("Call Me by Your Name").
 At least "Shirley" is watchable, praise I'd never foist upon her impenetrable "Madeline's Madeline," although the two works spring from the same idea of real-life trauma inspiring a wicked-brand of artistic expression. In this case, the muse is Shirley's new house guest, Rose Nemser (sinewy Odessa Young), who travels to sleepy Bennington, Vermont, with her aspiring professor husband, Fred (Logan Lerman), to begin married life residing with a couple that's perhaps been wedded far too long. Naturally, the interlopers are catnip for Shirley, a self-proclaimed provocateur, and her pretentious, blowhard husband Stanley Edgar Hyman (Michael Stuhlbarg overdoing the smarm).
 From the get-go, you know the reputable scholars will make quick work of the Nemsers and their newlywed bliss. They never have a chance; which makes the eventual standoff between the elders and the naive kids the equivalent of a lopsided football game. That's assuming the pigskin ever gets tossed around at tony Bennington College, an "all-girls" school where Stanley and Fred teach folklore to a bevy of 1950-era beauties open to a little sis boom bah.
 In turn, Shirley and her new gullible companion, Rose - hired to cook, clean and keep tabs on her reclusive host - conspire to push their men back, push them back, way back. With good reason we learn via Fred's late night dates with bottles of gin and Stanley's countless episodes of passive-aggressive digs delivered on the rare occasion he's not out schtupping the dean's prissy wife.
 The goal, apparently, is something akin to "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" cross pollinated with "The Shining," as Shirley sneers, swills booze and attacks her typewriter as if it's a stand-in for Stanley's face. I think it's Decker's intent to examine how the outside world directly informs the artist, as Shirley - fresh off her acclaimed short story, "The Lottery" \- draws inspiration for her psychological thriller, 1951's "The Hangsaman," via the real-life disappearance of Bennington College freshman Paula Jean Welden.
 As the novel progresses, the now pregnant Rose - under the heavy influence of smokes and drink - finds herself increasingly identifying with Paula Jean, a woman who had to vanish to finally be seen. As hard as they try, Decker and Gubbins never sell the analogy, despite Moss and Young working their butts off. Both are as excellent as Stuhlbarg and Lerman are unlikable and lifeless. Why did these ballsy women marry such drips? Who knows, and "Shirley" isn't about to tell you. True to most of Jackson's writings, it's a mystery.

Whenever Male boarded an airplane and was interested in passing the time in a pleasant conversation with a fellow passenger, he would introduce himself and let drop that he was, by profession, a hotel detective.
 Even when Male was a young man, hotel detectives were as antiquated as pince- nez eyewear and button-up shoes. They were a figment of Thin Man mysteries and the popular imagination. He might as likely have claimed to be a phrenologist.
 But it never failed to spark a conversation, he said.
 If, on the other hand, he wanted to be left alone, he would simply say that he was an English professor.
 “Oh,” the other passenger would say, “I’ll have to watch my grammar.”
 And Male would be able to read his Hawthorne in peace all the way to Dallas.
 I’ve had the same response from people when I’ve told them I was a newspaper editor, which seems to carry not only the image of being a grammar scold but also the lurking possibility of being quoted in newsprint on some slip of the tongue.
 The fear that they might dangle a participle or comprise something that should be composed intimidates people when they think they might be called on it.
 As a matter of fact, I don’t call out people for bad grammar. It’s bad manners, and I have enough weaknesses in that regard myself that I simply smile and nod at the occasional ain’t.
 Hamlet’s warning applies here: “Use every man according to his desert and who should ‘scape whipping?” Because I hope for grace from others, I try to afford it liberally ... in grammar and other things, too.
 But I will admit to wincing inwardly when I hear the language abused. If you spend 40 hours a week struggling to find comity between subjects and predicates, you naturally flinch when you hear them jangled together pell- mell.
 This all came to mind last week when I got an email from a reader who pointed out her own grammar pet peeve — the increasing lack of concern for when to use “I” and when to use “me.”
