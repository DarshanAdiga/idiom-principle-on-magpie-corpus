 # Wofford releases football game schedule that begins in late February
 Eric Boynton
 Herald-Journal
 A day after beginning fall football practice Wofford now knows exactly when it will finally begin the upcoming season this spring after being delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 It was announced Wednesday the three-time defending Southern Conference champions will open the season Feb. 20 at home against Mercer. The eight-game schedule features only league opponents with a lone bye coming March 27.
 Preparing for their third season under head coach Josh Conklin, the Terriers are looking to advance to the NCAA FCS playoffs for a fourth-consecutive season after finishing 8-4 last year including 7-1 in conference play.
 Wofford’s opener against Mercer will be the first time the Terriers have ever played a football game in February. The Bears are playing three games this fall. Next up is a Feb. 27 trip to Chattanooga. The Mocs are scheduled to play one fall game Saturday against Western Kentucky. Wofford won last year’s meeting, 35-34, in overtime.
 East Tennessee State plays March 6 at Wofford with the Terriers having won nine-consecutive games against the Buccaneers. Wofford will attempt to break a five-game losing streak March 13 at Samford and then hope to continue its recent domination over The Citadel at home on March 20. Wofford has won 18 of the last 20 against the Bulldogs, who lost all four games played this fall.
 After an open date, the Terriers host VMI on April 3 looking to extend an eight-game win streak in the series. Wofford also has a four-game win streak they will look to expand when traveling to play Western Carolina on April 10. The Catamounts are schedule to play three games this fall.
 The regular-season finale comes April 17 at Furman in the 95th game of the series which began in 1889.
 With the fluid situation surrounding the pandemic all dates are subject to change. Kickoff times, ticket and broadcast information will be announced at a later time. All teams’ games will air on either ESPN3 or ESPN+ if not chosen for a national or regional broadcast.
