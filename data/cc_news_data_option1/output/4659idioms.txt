BALTIMORE (AP) — Baltimore officials are set to approve a roughly $8 million settlement to two men who went to prison after drugs were planted on them a decade ago during an encounter with members of a rogue police unit that brutalized, robbed and falsely arrested residents. The city’s spending board is scheduled to take up the settlement Wednesday, news outlets reported. The Board of Estimates has approved several settlements in recent weeks stemming from the misconduct of members of the Gun Trace Task Force, a once- lauded group that was supposed to take guns off the streets of Baltimore. The settlement for Umar Burley and Brent Matthews is the largest settlement in connection with the task force and surpasses the amount paid in 2015 to the family of Freddie Gray, a young Black man who died a week after he was critically injured in police custody and whose death lead to civil unrest. The proposed payment includes $6.3 million for Burley and Matthews as well as $1.8 million to pay off a lien due to the estate of Elbert Davis, which sued Burley. Burley and Matthews encountered task force members in 2010 during an illegal traffic stop that led to a high-speed chase. Burley crashed with another vehicle, killing Davis. Burley spent seven years in prison, while Matthews served two-and-half years behind bars. Their convictions were vacated in 2017 after officers cooperating in the federal investigation into the task force told authorities that a member of the unit had spoken of drugs being planted in the incident. “Mr. Burley and Mr. Matthews were overtly and undeniably framed by a conspiracy of at least four police officers,” the men’s attorneys, Steve Silverman, said in a statement. “It should not take an army of lawyers litigating for years to right wrongs...

This festive trend is picking up some steam in 2020, but it isn't exactly a new concept. People have been making charcuterie chalets since at least 2016. So luckily for you, there are some tried and true strategies to making yours as good as it can be!
 Instagram account @jisookangg used mini breadsticks to give their chalet a Lincoln log vibe; @sorrenteaux turned the cheese into gingerbread cookie shapes and the cucumbers into Christmas trees; @farmcurious swirled the meat to add texture to the lined walkway; and @syntaxchen used some sort of dip at the top of the roof (good for color, eating, and holding the pieces together). Don't be afraid to get inspiration from those who have already made charcuterie chalets (and then make it your own!).
 Since the pieces are more individual than a gingerbread house, it might take a little more time to put the charcuterie chalet together. However, we think with that bottle of wine handy and a good Christmas movie playing in the background, you'll be admiring your creation in no time!

The 90-second video posted online Saturday begins with an elderly man recalling his ‘service’ to the nation back when he was just a young student “in the winter of 2020. With violins stirring at viewers’ heart strings, the setting switches to a scene of the narrator as a young man. He continues that "we mustered all our courage and did what was expected of us, the only right thing. We did nothing.” The ad ends with a government message that “you too can become a hero by staying at home.”

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage across our state. At the time of the writing of this letter, our state and our city continue to see record-breaking numbers of active cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Hospitals are full, and testing is slowing down. The virus is spreading, and people are dying.
 According to the most recent White House Coronavirus Task Force report from Nov. 8, “Oklahoma is in the red zone for cases, indicating 101 or more new cases per 100,000 population, with the 22nd highest rate in the country. Oklahoma is in the red zone for test positivity, indicating a rate at or above 10.1%, with the 11th highest rate in the country.”
 This is our current reality. It is very sobering, but Oklahomans can all still do their part to limit the spread and protect ourselves and our loved ones by following the three Ws: wearing our masks, washing our hands, and watching our distance. The “three Ws” have become the call to action from our state Health Department, medical professionals, and even our governor. Yet Nov. 15, the temporary amendment that allows local governments and governing bodies around the state to meet virtually has expired. “Watching our distance” will now become exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, when conducting city, county, and state business.

Norman McNew died on Tuesday, November 10, 2020, at the age of 92.His mother died when he was three years old leaving him, his sister Frances, and his brother Perry. He and Frances spent their younger years with their grandmother Mc New in Alamogordo or with their aunt Ina and uncle Bill and cousin Billy at their ranch near Orogrande. While living at the ranch, he rode horseback and helped look after the cattle from the time he was seven years old.After graduating from high school, he entered the University of New Mexico where he later received his degree in Business Administration. While at the University, he was a member of the rodeo team, where he received many honors. The most significant was taking second place in the bareback bronc riding at the National Intercollegiate finals held in the Cow Palace in San Francisco. He received varsity letters from UNM, which at the time were accompanied by a lifetime pass to all university sports in Albuquerque. He was a member of the Lobo Club and the Alumni Letterman's Club and was an avid Lobo supporter for some sixty years.After his discharge from the army, he farmed in Bosque Farms for twenty years. When he sold the farm, he went to work for the County of Bernalillo as their Real Estate Administrator. He was instrumental in the purchase of much of the property which the county now owns such as the land where the District Court building now stands, the Union Station Building which houses the District Attorney's office, and several fire stations and park sites. On three occasions, he was sent to the Road Department, later known as the Public Works Department, as the administrator. He was the authority on the status of roads in the county, and he also implemented the Rural Addressing system in the county areas outside city limits.After he retired from the county, he spent much of his time working on his son-in-law's farm in Moriarty. He enjoyed running the large machines, discing, cutting corn, and baling hay. He worked ten-hour days and did this for several years. When it became a little too much for him working all day long, he still would go out to the farm and mow the large lawns and take care of the other chores around the residence and the barns. After he couldn't drive to Moriarty any longer, he could still be seen mowing his and his daughter's lawns in Albuquerque after he was 90 years old. His yard was the pride of the neighborhood.He was preceded in death by his father and wonderful stepmother, Hattie (Sugar), and his brother Perry. He is survived by his sister, Frances; his daughters, Erin and her husband Sam King, and Kimberly and her husband Tom Beecher; four grandchildren, Tyler and his wife Chauna, Audra and her husband Jamie, Haley, Kelsey and her wife Catie; and four great-grandchildren, Sam, Maverick, Reece, and Alec.

“Eleven under for the last two days, I think that sort of speaks for itself," he said. "The good golf was in there, I just didn’t allow myself to play that way on the first 18 holes. This course can do that. This course can make you a little bit careful and a little bit tentative at times.”
 On Thursday, McIlroy was even at the turn and 1 over when he arrived at No. 13, where he flew his drive into the heavy brush to the left of the fairway; he took a drop, punched out, landed an approach 18 feet from the pin and two- putted.
 That started a string of three bogeys in four holes.
 “I try to view everything as a learning experience,” McIlroy said. “But, yeah, I’ll look back at that and rue some of the shots that I hit and some of the thought processes I had and just try to learn from it and be better the next time.”
 McIlroy won the U.S. Open in 2011, the British Open in 2014 and the PGA Championship twice, in 2012 and ’14. His best finish at Augusta was fourth in 2015, when he was fourth, six strokes behind winner Jordan Spieth.
 Playing with 1985 and ’93 Masters champion Bernhard Langer on Saturday, McIlroy had an up-close view of what it would mean to win at Augusta.
 “It’s some of the coolest traditions in our game. Of course you want to be part of that for the rest of your life if you can,” he said. “Look, winning the Masters would be cool, winning the Grand Slam would be cool and there’s a lot of great things that come along with that.
 “But at the end of the day you have to simplify it as much as you can. It’s just a golf tournament, and you’re playing against guys you see every week. It shouldn’t be that different.”

Augusta, Ga. (AP) — Stuck in the bushes. Behind a tree. Caught in the branches.
 Rory McIlroy saw every part of the 13th hole at Augusta National this week — except for the middle of the fairway. On Saturday, he turned a 9-foot birdie chance into a three-putt bogey and cost himself any chance at a Masters victory that would complete his career Grand Slam.
 “I have zero thoughts about winning this golf tournament right now,” he said after shooting 67 to finish the day at 8 under par, eight strokes behind leader Dustin Johnson. “I think I’ve left myself too far back after the bad first day. But I’ll go and give it a good effort tomorrow and see where that leaves me.”
 Following an opening-round 75 with a 66 on Friday, McIlroy was on his way back to contention after chipping in from the greenside bunker on No. 12 for his fifth birdie in a bogey-free round. But the 13th, where he took a drop on Thursday and got blocked by a tree trunk on Friday, stymied him again in the third round.
 The 31-year-old from Northern Ireland caught some branches with his drive; he laid up with his second shot to avoid the tributary of Rae’s Creek that fronts the green, then chipped to within 9 feet of the hole. But he slid the birdie putt 4 feet past the hole, then lipped out on the comebacker for his second bogey on No. 13 in three rounds.
 Instead of improving to 6 under, he was back to 4 under. He made birdie on No. 16.

The Vikings on Saturday waived Elflein, a day after he was activated off injured reserve. Elflein’s 3 1/2-season tenure in Minnesota ends after he had been a starter over the years at three different positions.
 A source had told the Pioneer Press on Friday that Cleveland would continue to start at right guard. A source said Saturday that the decision to go with Cleveland was the key reason for cutting Elflein, who becomes a free agent after the season and was not considered a candidate to return.
 “We just felt like we had some better options,” said Vikings coach Mike Zimmer. “It’s always tough. These guys come in and compete and work real hard. Sometimes you just have to make those decisions.”
 Elflein’s spot on the roster was taken by long snapper Austin Cutting, who was activated off the COVID-19 reserve list after being placed on it Tuesday.
 Elflein, a third-round pick in 2017, was the starting center in 2017 and 2018 and the starter at left guard in 2019 before being moved to right guard this season. He started the opener against Green Bay before suffering a torn thumb ligament in practice and missing the next seven games following surgery.
