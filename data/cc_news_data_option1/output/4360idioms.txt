The Army has always viewed its active forces as the first among equals within the three elements of the total force. Active Army units have traditionally been accorded the first priority for scarce resources, new equipment, and even emerging new missions such as cyber defense. Yet the coming era of fiscal austerity combined with the growing threats to the homeland may well require inverting that traditional relationship. Reserve forces are a wise strategic investment during lean budgetary times, because they preserve both combat and support force structure at far less cost, and provide vital capabilities for both domestic and overseas scenarios. Future wartime demands may find these forces pulled in both directions, but they nevertheless remain a cost- effective investment across a huge range of missions. As the budget axe falls, the Army should not simply make equal cuts to active, reserve, and Guard end strength and force structure in order to share the bureaucratic pain equally. Instead, it should consider preserving some more reserve capabilities above active capabilities, in order to strengthen the total force’s ability to defend the homeland effectively while also husbanding critical war-fighting capabilities in the most economical way possible.

I see a lot of parallels between the relationship I have with my company's identity and the relationships I have outside of work. Most people can relate to staying in a personal relationship they knew wasn't right and feeling the subsequent stress of dissonance and unfulfillment. In business, those feelings will be amplified a thousand times and could cost you financially by deteriorating your brand quality. As in life, the noes are perhaps more consequential than the yeses, and at the end of the day, being unwavering in what you value is always the best M.O.

Mary N. Smith and Alyce J. Machak both know they're facing an uphill battle in Gaston County.
   
 They're blue leaders in a county that is most assuredly red, a county in which President Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by a better than 2-to-1 margin just four years ago.
   
 Machak, a former chairwoman of the Gaston County Democratic Party, is now head of the Democratic Women of Gaston County.
   
 Smith served two terms as the women's leader before Machak.
   
 In a conversation with a Gazette reporter, both women urged other women, and indeed all voters, to look beyond slogans, TV ads, and harsh rhetoric to examine what both major parties stand for.
   
 Smith is particularly disturbed by what she called the depiction of Democrats as "baby killers."
   
 Instead, she says, Democrats advocate affordable care for all, access to health education for all, and birth control counseling for all who want it.
   
 "We want to see the time when abortion is a rare and unusual circumstance," she said. "But we don't want to see the government making decisions for women."
   
 "That sort of decision should be made by the woman, her family, her doctor and her minister," Smith continued. "Not the government."
   
 "It is not up to the government to sit in judgment," Machak said. "You have to know the woman's story. You have to know what is in her heart. You have to know the dangers to her health. And you have to give healing, not judgment to rape victims."
   
 Smith also cautioned that Americans should take seriously the threat to voting rights.
   
 "I can remember my grandfather having to take a literacy test when he tried to vote," she said. "He could not read. So, of course, he could not vote. Voting is a right, not a privilege."
   
 "The Democratic Party," she continued, "is more inclusive to people of color, to women, to all minorities."
   
 "We have got to work together to make things better," Smith concluded. "We have got to come to the table and talk to each other, not scream at each other. We've got to get on the same page as a country."

This shift has profound implications for the Army. For decades, the Army has arguably been the U.S. military’s _primus inter pares_ , the first among equals, of the four services. During the Cold War, the U.S. Army formed the bulk of NATO forces postured to deter or defeat a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. It also provided most of the forces that served in Korea, Vietnam, the 1991 Gulf War, and more recently, Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army has grown accustomed to being what’s called the _supported service_ , where the other services help enable its land operations. Yet the explicit prioritization of China over Russia means that this relationship is about to flip. The Army will be a _supporting service_ in any potential conflict with China, tasked with enabling the other services in a conflict that would span the vast air and maritime domain of the Western Pacific.

"Our fossil discovery, with its estimate of a 5-to-6-meter wingspan -- nearly 20 feet -- shows that birds evolved to a truly gigantic size relatively quickly after the extinction of the dinosaurs and ruled over the oceans for millions of years," Kloess said in a news release by the university.
 "The extreme, giant size of these extinct birds is unsurpassed in ocean habitats," added study co-author Ashley Poust of the San Diego Natural History Museum.
 Like albatrosses, the pelagornithids traveled widely over the world, and could have flown for weeks at a time over the sea. At the time, oceans had yet to be dominated by whales and seals -- meaning easy prey for the giant birds.
 "The big (pelagornithids) are nearly twice the size of albatrosses, and these bony-toothed birds would have been formidable predators that evolved to be at the top of their ecosystem," said study co-author Thomas Stidham of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.
 The study also painted a portrait of what Antarctica might have looked like 50 million years ago. It would have been much warmer back then, home to land mammals like the distant relatives of sloths and anteaters. Antarctic birds also flourished there, including early penguin species and the extinct relatives of ducks and ostriches. Pelagornithids would have existed in this ecosystem alongside the others, potentially competing for foraging and nesting spaces.
 Seymour Island, part of Antarctica closest to the tip of South America, has been the site of numerous other breakthroughs. A study of fossils discovered there found this April that a tiny species of frog once lived in the region -- the first modern amphibian discovered in Antarctica. Fossilized cocoons of leeches have also been found on Seymour Island, as well as a handful of mammals.
 "My guess is that (Antarctica) was a rich and diverse place," said Thomas Mörs, a senior curator at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, in April. "We have only found a percentage of what lived there."

Security sector assistance was critical for building the web of U.S. alliances and partnerships that endures across the globe, as well as the military capacity of many countries in these regions. That was then. This is now. Today, the United States is no longer well-positioned to use security sector assistance to compete with China and Russia — especially in “gray zone” activities short of war — or to prepare for a potential conflict with either of them. Security sector assistance can be a vital tool of American statecraft. Using it effectively will require rethinking the types of assistance the United States provides, reorienting this assistance toward the regions that matter most, and better integrating it with other instruments of national power. Much of the heavy lifting will take place behind the scenes, in Congress and the interagency process, where reforms to the ways in which security assistance is prioritized, planned, and implemented are desperately needed.

Bangladesh’s cricket establishment is waiting eagerly to welcome Shakib Al Hasan with open arms as he completes his one-year anti-corruption rule violation ban on October 29.
 Shakib was handed a two-year ban, with a one-year suspended sentence, by ICC’s Anti-Corruption Unit on October 29 last year, for failing to report multiple corrupt approaches by an Indian bookmaker.
 Shakin during numerous interactions later has confessed that it was a mistake on his part to have not notified the authorities. And Mahmudullah said Bangladesh cricket team is waiting with bated breath to welcome back Shakib into the dressing room.
 “Our boy is coming back home,” said an elated Bangladesh T20 captain Mahmudullah, which is the collective mood of country’s cricketing fraternity. We know that Shakib has been the best player for so many years, for the Bangladesh cricket team. We are all eagerly waiting for his return to the dressing room,” Mahmudullah was quoted as saying by ESPN Cricinfo.
 “It feels good to know that we can see him, talk to him and spend time with him,” he added.
 The 33-year-old all-rounder is currently in the United States with his family and is expected to return to Bangladesh early next month.
 “Shakib is a champion player. I think it won’t take him long to get back to rhythm. I believe that he will get it back as soon as he enters the cricket field,” said Mahmudullah, who has been playing international cricket along side Shakib for the last 13 years.
 “The biggest thing is that we can fill up the gap that his absence had created. He always makes important contributions with the bat and ball.”
 Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) chief selector Minhajul Abedin said Shakib will be eased into the international scene through the domestic route.
 “Our best player is coming back to the field. He now has to prepare himself for domestic tournaments since we don’t have any international series for the time being,” Abedin said. “We have to monitor his physical condition. Let him start in domestic cricket. We should give him time but he is a very experienced player. He won’t take long to get back into rhythm,” he said.
 Abedin admitted that Bangladesh badly missed Shakib during the last one year. “We definitely missed him. He is one of the best all-rounders in the world and there are so few of them these days. We are lucky to have a batting all- rounder like him, which gives us a lot of advantage.”

Try asking a creative mind to shoehorn his work of art in a style that suits the audience’s perception of his idea, chances are that you will be met with a response similar to Bejoy Nambiar’s. “If I had to distill [the film], then yeah... _Taish_ is a revenge drama,” the 41-year-old filmmaker says, when asked to classify his upcoming film’s genre.
 “I’m a big fan of the drama genre. I’m also a fan of human [centric] stories. I tend to gravitate towards these ideas when I write. _Taish_ is an example. It has action, it is set in the format of a thriller, but at the core of it, the film is a human [centric] story and tackles serious issues (sic),” he adds, over phone from his Mumbai residence.
 ## Cut from the same cloth
 Starring Pulkit Samrat, Kriti Kharbanda, Jim Sarbh, Harshvardhan Rane and Abhimanyu Singh among others, _Taish_ is set to make a simultaneous release as a film and a six-episode web series on ZEE5 on October 29. It follows the story of two warring families and a past incident that comes to haunt them. “A cycle of violence and revenge starts and there is seemingly no tangible end,” Bejoy notes.

BOSTON -- Gov. Charlie Baker and his top education advisors urged schools Tuesday not to overreact to the rise in COVID-19 cases this fall, telling even those districts in communities deemed to be at the highest risk for transmission of the virus to stick with in-person learning unless there is evidence of spread within the school system.
 Education Secretary Jim Peyser and Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Jeff Riley also defended plans for the state to administer the MCAS exam in the spring, describing the test as being linked to federal funding and necessary to measure how far students may have fallen behind.
 The recommendations from Baker and his senior education team came after three straight days of the state reporting more than 1,000 new cases of COVID-19, a mark not seen since May. The administration, however, continued to assert that schools have not been linked to increased transmission.
 "We are not seeing the spread take place, the clustering take place, in the schools as was initially feared," Riley said. Last week, education officials reported 202 cases of COVID-19 detected in schools.
 Boston last week switched to full remote learning, and after three weeks in the high-risk category Abington Public Schools said Monday it would shift to remote-only learning until at least Nov. 12. In Milton, the high school will pivot to fully-remote learning starting Tuesday after the rise in infections left it understaffed.
 Baker said he wouldn't "Monday morning quarterback" any district's decision, but suggested school might be a safer place for teenagers than at home.
 "It's a jump ball in my mind about whether having all those kids at home fraternizing with their friends, not wearing a mask, not socially distancing on the off-hours, is probably every bit as risky, maybe more so based on what's going on in the parochial schools, than those kids being at schools, wearing a mask and having the rhythm and the structure that comes with spending six or seven hours a day in a formal setting where everybody's got a face covering on," Baker said.
 The governor said he understood, for instance, why Marblehead went remote for two weeks after it could not identify all the attendees of a large party. He then pointed out the decision his hometown of Swampscott made to switch to a hybrid model after being in the high-risk red category for multiple weeks.
 "If you don't have any transmission in your schools, it's probably fine to continue to have kids go to school," the governor said.
 Peyser and Riley testified before the Joint Committee on Education on Tuesday as part of a legislative oversight hearing on the state's return to school in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The governor's comments were made later in the day during a press conference where he backed up the message from his advisors.
 The Baker administration has asked districts to review at least three weeks of community COVID-19 data before considering changes to their learning models, but Peyser said even consistently "red" communities should not switch to remote learning unless the virus is spreading in schools.
 "It is increasingly clear that schools are not a source of transmission," Peyser said.
 Billerica School Superintendent Tim Piwowar said that in his town, where they adopted a hybrid learning model, there have been 15 cases of COVID-19 in the school community. While he said Billerica will likely soon be in the "red" category, the schools have detected no evidence of transmission and only five close contacts within the classroom setting.
 Piwowar said the biggest impediments in Billerica to bringing all students back to the classroom was physical space to accommodate six feet of distancing and transportation.
 "We simply do not have the financial wherewithal to double our transportation costs to facilitate a full in-person return," Piwowar said.
 Riley said DESE was reviewing whether it could safely loosen the guidelines for school transportation and distancing on buses, particularly for rural school districts where students must travel longer distances to get to schools.
 "That is still in development and no decision has been made on that and it has to be blessed by medical professionals," Riley said.
 Sen. Jason Lewis, the co-chair of the committee, acknowledged competing desires among educators, advocates and parents for the state to either provide clearer guidance on how schools should act, or to leave those decisions more fully to local communities.
 "There are no easy answers," Lewis said. "What I'm sure we can all agree upon is we must do everything we can to support the academic and social-emotional needs of all our students."
 Piwowar said that while he could support an MCAS exam this spring to be used as a diagnostic tool, he said it should be "loudly, clearly and repeatedly" stated that the test will not be used to hold teachers accountable or to compare districts.
 Massachusetts Association of School Committees Executive Director Glenn Koocher also said he was leery of how the test data might be used. And while he credited Riley with trying to heal the relationship between DESE and local school officials, he said a "detente" is probably the best that could be achieved.
 "To those who will threaten districts, I would simply say, when you threaten us, you demonize yourself," Koocher said, taking issue with DESE's plans to audit districts that remain remote despite low virus activity.
 Peyser said the MCAS would be important this school year for the state to understand how much learning students lost by being home for many months, or trying to learn remotely. While he predicted an increase in pressure to suspend the exam for another year, he called that a "stalking horse" for ending standardized testing completely.
 Riley said the department also has no reason to believe that the federal government will relax testing requirements in 2021, which is linked to substantial amounts of federal education aid.
 "We do need, at a bare minimum, diagnostic statewide data and I think parents want to know if their kids have lost ground and how much," Riley said.
 The hearing took place at the same time Baker and Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders were warning that celebrations of Thanksgiving with extended family this year would be extremely risky.
 Sen. Julian Cyr, of Truro, asked, through the chairman of the committee, whether districts or the state should consider a mandatory week of remote learning after the holiday to mitigate the threat of students bringing COVID-19 into the schools from holiday travel or festivities.
 Peyser responded that the state was focused on maximizing safe time in the classroom, and Riley said that although it had been discussed, it was not the department's recommendation.
 "We think, at this time, that is not the way to go," Riley said.
 The emphasis on making sure as many students are able to return to the classroom as possible comes as the Trump administration is preparing to send more than 2 million rapid COVID-19 antigen tests to Massachusetts that will be deployed to an initial group of schools in early November.
 Riley said the pilot program using Abbott BinaxNOW tests, which can diagnose coronavirus infection in as little as 15 minutes, will be a critical new tool for schools to identify infection in symptomatic students and staff and contain the virus before it starts spreading.
 Riley hinted that in the coming weeks the administration also would have a major announcement to make on internet connectivity and hotspots for students.
 Hadley School Superintendent Anne McKenzie said internet connectivity continues to be an issue in western Massachusetts, where even some principals didn't have home internet at the start of the pandemic.
 "This issue of connectivity in western Massachusetts cannot be overstated," McKenzie said.
 Thomas Scott, the executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, said one of his biggest concerns was burnout of administrators and teachers, which was repeated by a number of administrators about the pressure and long hours teachers are dealing with.
 "We're still learning as we go but it's clear to us we have to be cognizant of the demands we're making on people right now," Scott said.

We have significant flattening to achieve. We’re not rounding a corner — at least not locally — unless it’s into oncoming traffic.
 Last week Mesa County recorded 74 cases in a single day — we’re only supposed to have 75 in a two-week period to regain the state’s least restrictive variance. Bear in mind that those numbers are off by a factor of 10 or more, meaning 50 cases confirmed by testing probably means 500 more that have gone undetected.
 We’re as sick of this virus as anyone. We’ve written somewhere on the order of 30 editorials that have touched on some aspect of the pandemic since Jan. 30. But it bears pointing out that pandemic fatigue is largely a state of mind.
 It’s one thing to endure public service announcements about the efficacy of mask-wearing — quite another to see our schools revert to remote learning or our local hospital staffs demoralized by swollen COVID-19 admissions. Thankfully, we’re not there yet, and more importantly, we can avoid worst-case scenarios by acknowledging our weak spots.

Not only do they have to create a story for their movie, they have to sell the other players on their movie. The trick is they can only use the words on the cards as well as a few other words to connect them into a descriptive title. Coming up with and listening to cool movie titles is entertaining; however, being a producer also requires some strategy.

 It added that such safeguards will ensure better quality content moderation by companies of content generated by users.
 “The EU approach to the freedom of expression is different to that of the US so our approach to moderating content online must be different also. Our proposal is based on European values and laws and sets clear limits to the legal safeguard for service providers in order to protect the freedom of expression and to prevent overaction by service providers,” El Ramly, EDiMA’s Director General, said.
 Under existing rules, online service providers are obliged to remove illegal content when they have ‘actual knowledge’ of its presence. This ensures that companies are not obliged to police all content uploaded by users, which would inevitably infringe on the fundamental rights to speech and privacy.
 However, if a service provider is deemed to have ‘actual knowledge’ of illegal activity/content on their service that they fail to remove, they cannot benefit from the limited liability provisions of the e-Commerce Directive.
 If a service provider has put in place an algorithm to detect infringements, it is not entirely clear if these measures confer ‘actual knowledge’ on the service provider.
 In the US, protection has been provided through Good Samaritan Principle, under Section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act. It states that actions taken by a service provider to reduce illegal activity online do not impact on the limited liability of the service provider.
 However, it gives online service providers greater control on removing not only illegal content but also “not-illegal-but-harmful” content. The principle has received criticism as it is framed in manner of freedom of speech to service providers than as a tool to protect them from liability for illegal content.
 “This has raised concerns that the US Good Samaritan Principle potentially creates a difficult hurdle to overcome when someone wishes to question a service provider’s moderation decision on content that is not illegal. For these reasons and others, Europe needs to take a different approach,” Edima said.
 In a paper published as part of its Online Responsibility Framework Series, the association recommends new measures for service providers including minimum information levels in notices of illegal content and the requirement of a human review of appeals of removal of content. It also acknowledges the need for an appropriate governance structure to manage these provisions and called this to be a part of Digital Services Act.

Batman is pitted against robotic versions of his rogues gallery, including a robotic Riddler who manages two puzzles at the same time, but there’s one villain that isn’t there - and that may give Batman the key he needs to turn the tables. Superman, meanwhile, is put through a more challenging test as he’s faced with a robotic version of Lex Luthor who wants to understand why Superman seems unable to save him. It’s an interesting twist, as it seems like this flawed Brainiac double is almost childlike in its attempt to understand the heroes. That’s why it’s a bit disappointing when the story veers into a more routine direction with the end of the issue, as the heroes are reunited and the villain takes a much more direct route to getting answers - by invading Earth. Max Raynor’s art is well-suited to the action-heavy story, and this continues to be one of the more entertaining team-up books DC has put out in recent years.

The person with the microphone has to be at least 12 feet away from the closest customer. Health officials have said that things like singing tend to project moisture particles farther than the normal six-foot “social distancing’’ barrier.
 But with plexiglass dividers in place, six feet is acceptable.
 Microphones have to be disinfected or changed out between customers.
 And while it may interfere with hitting some of those high notes, participants have to keep on their masks.
 More interested in a game of pool?
 That, too, is now OK, but with a maximum of four players for a table and no one else gathered around. There has to be that six-foot physical distancing between the players and other game areas. And if players don’t have their own equipment, everything else needs to be disinfected between each group’s use.
 Arcade and video games have their own set of rules, with just two player to a machine — and no spectators or cheering section behind them. There also are the physical distancing requirements, whether it’s the six feet of space or closing off every other machine.
 Plus, of course, masks are mandatory.
 The new rules also account for bowling and even axe throwing, with only the active participant permitted to be out of his or her chair and a limit of no more than 10 in players and observers.
 And if you have your own bowling ball — or axe — please bring it.
 The rules are set up pretty much that those who are not participating in any activity are supposed to remain seated except to play or go to the bathroom. Standing, mingling and dancing remain off limits.
 In fact, the rules say if there is a dance floor it has to be closed off to the public or “repurposed’’ for more seats to allow greater social distancing among patrons.
 Arizona has not actually been game-free all this time. Wurman pointed out that some enterprises that sell alcohol but are licensed as restaurants, like Dave and Buster’s, have had arcade games all along.
 What this does, he said, is level the playing field and allow facilities licensed as bars to compete head-to-head.

But it is obsessed with Russia now that the country has a GDP smaller than Italy’s and some hackers and poorly trafficked websites spreading bad information.
 This fixation drives the ridiculous magnification of small-time pro-Russia players and the belief that the Russians have a hand in nearly every significant American event.

Some of the most intriguing new capabilities Sony demonstrated at CEATEC combine elements from multiple different branches of the company, including sensors and imaging, audio, robotics, and even Sony Pictures. One of the demos on display (note the video is in Japanese but has English subtitles) highlighted a series of robotic cameras that were built and optimized to live stream music. Though details were limited, the system was built with the intention of lowering production costs for streaming and is meant to provide an alternative means of enjoying live music - even once the impact of the pandemic has passed.
 Another interesting demo, built in conjunction with Sony Pictures, showed the company's work to build a virtual production studio. Though the concept was premiered earlier this year at CES, the effort has taken on new meaning and importance in light of the challenges associated with filming content in the real world or even on certain types of sets. The company uses volumetric cameras to capture 3D images and data from sets and real-world locations, then integrates them with existing high-resolution Sony cameras and a crystal LED- powered display system to allow the creation of high-resolution content in much smaller spaces with smaller numbers of production staff. The idea is to reduce costs and increase the flexibility of generating high-quality content, as well as provide actors with the ability to see what the environments around them will actually look like.
 In a somewhat related announcement, the company also showed off the final shipping version of its 3D Spatial Reality Display, a $5,000 4K resolution 15.6" PC monitor that allows 3D modelers, virtual set creators, and other creative professionals to see 3D content without the need for specialized glasses. The monitor uses what the company calls Eye-Sensing Light Field Display technology, which means it has sensors that track the viewers' eye location and angle, adjusts the light-field-based rendering elements of the display in real-time, then pushes the image through a micro optical lens coating on the display's surface. The end result, according to the company, is a realistic stereoscopic display, without any glasses, that moves naturally as the viewer's head and eyes move around. In addition to hardware, Sony also offers software integration with leading 3D engines Unity and Unreal, making it easy to integrate the technology into existing workflows.

As China, Russia, and others compete across a range of domains stretching beyond traditional military strength — cyber security, law enforcement, and disinformation — the U.S. government should enhance its ability to provide timely, relevant assistance in these areas. In our experience in government, American allies and partners routinely ask for this assistance. Yet, U.S. capacity building in each of these areas is immature. Cyber security assistance is meagerly resourced and often _ad hoc_ , with limited assistance programs spread incoherently across government agencies. Likewise, intelligence and law enforcement capacity building are limited and often plagued by turf battles. Enabling allies and partners to counter disinformation represents an emerging area of focus, and Washington should rise to the occasion. In many of these areas, effective governance is often one of the most crucial gaps America’s allies and partners confront. To meet these challenges, the United States should reimagine security sector assistance, factor in its impact on governance and rule of law, and increase the involvement of the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and Treasury.

In fact, I was advised by Gillian and Walker that Hunter and Jim Biden were paranoid about keeping Joe Biden’s involvement secret. I also had a disagreement with Hunter about the funds CFC was contributing to Sinohawk.   Hunter wanted $5 million of those funds to go to himself and his family, so he wanted the funds wired directly to an entity affiliated with him. I objected, because that was contrary to our written agreements concerning Sinohawk.

 # Blountstown eliminates Bozeman for 2nd straight year
 Dustin Kent
 The News Herald
 SAND HILLS — For the second straight season, Bozeman found its season ending in the same fashion: with a three-set home loss to Blountstown in the Region 2-1A semifinals.
 However, a wildly competitive third set gave the Bucks reason for optimism heading into the offseason and the Tigers reason for relief as they head into the next round.
 Blountstown (9-8) eliminated the Bucks (10-4) by scores of 25-12, 25-13, 33-31 to advance to Saturday's region final against Sneads.
 The finish wasn't as clean as the start for the Tigers, but head coach Leigh Ann Summers and her girls are happy just to be moving on.
 "It was a great fight," Summers said of the third set. "I ran out of substitutions there at the end and had a (defensive specialist) that had to go play outside for three rotations, but I'm proud of how they handled that. It was a nailbiter back and forth, but the kids stepped up and finally strung two points together.
 "We've got to be tougher on that, but I was proud of their effort and proud of the kids for having to step out of their comfort zone and play a position they've never practiced."
 For Bozeman, it's a quick end to its second-ever postseason appearance, but Bucks coach Sean Fields said the third set demonstrated the growth of his team over the past year.
 "You could see from the last set that the girls were capable of playing with Blountstown," he said. "They got almost kind of awestruck in the first set and had to kind of battle back some. At times we played well and at times it went back and forth and at times we were kind of overwhelmed with their big hitters.
 "But once we settled a little bit and got into our game I thought we competed well, and the girls never gave up. They played hard the whole time."
 Bozeman was right there through the first half of the first set, trailing 11-10 before the Tigers exploded for a 14-2 run to finish it out thanks to four straight serves from both Layla Bailey and Jaren Williams and three kills each from Williams and Shelbi Dawson.
 The Tigers led from wire to wire in the second set, closing it out with a kill from Bailey and two straight serves from Cydnee Eubanks.
 In the third set, the Bucks took control with five straight points featuring four consecutive serves, including an ace, by Mackenzi Jones to go up 12-7. Blountstown rallied back to tie it up 16-16 on a kill by Kamryn Parrish, but Bozeman scored three of the next four points, getting a pair of kills from Kyra Pierce, to take a 20-17 advantage.
 Another kill from Hannah Flemming made it a 23-21 Bozeman lead, but Blountstown got two straight kills from Eubanks to tie it back up. An error by the Tigers gave the Bucks a set point, but a putaway by Parrish followed by a kill from Alyssa Carey turned the tables and gave Blountstown a match point at 25-24.
 A big block-kill by Pierce on the ensuing point kept the Bucks alive, as did three attacking errors and a service error on Blountstown's next four match points.
 A successful serve by Piper Messick ending with another Blountstown error gave Bozeman its second set point at 30-29, but Messick's next serve went out of bounds to tie it back up.
 After failing to convert on yet another match point two points later, the Tigers finally finished off the set and the match when a long rally ended with a Bozeman attacking error, with the ball hitting the floor just in front of the net in between a pair of Bucks players.
 Despite the loss and the end of the season, Fields said this year represented a major step forward for the program and is a sign of good things to come for a team that had just two seniors and one junior on the roster.
 "Absolutely, I think the girls, even in some of the games they won this year weren't pleased with how they played and they're not gonna be pleased with how they played tonight," Fields said. "This will sit bad with them for the whole offseason. I think at times the girls played well and at times they didn't, but losing two great seniors, we've got a ton of young kids who can play and hopefully seeing that last set and seeing how competitive we can be at the regional level will springboard us into the offseason."

First, we need to go beyond accuracy to do the math. Bayes' theorem takes into account both the false positive and the false negative rate — not undifferentiated "accuracy." That means that if we want to know what a test result means for our probability of having a disease, we need to know how often each type of error occurs. More generally, if we want to know how to update our beliefs in light of some new piece of evidence, we need to know how often that evidence should arise under each hypothesis we're entertaining.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -A federal judge in South Carolina ruled Tuesday that local election boards cannot reject voters' absentee ballots on the basis of mismatched signatures and must review and reprocess previously rejected ballots for the upcoming general election.The temporary injunction comes after a recent survey by the South Carolina State Election Commission discovered a handful of county election boards were conducting signature matching on ballots, though the state has no laws, rules or regulations on the practice.U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel of Charleston wrote Tuesday that counties that wish to continue matching signatures on absentee ballots must seek approval of the court first.Voter outreach groups filed the lawsuit earlier this month, as the significant number of first-time absentee voters this election has brought due process issues to the forefront, said Christe McCoy-Lawrence, co-president of the League of Women Voters' South Carolina chapter. The suit sought a permanent procedure for elections officials to notify voters and allow them to fix ballots with signature issues.“This decision is a significant win for voter confidence in a year when the COVID-19 pandemic has upended our elections with rule changes, delays and massive surges in mail voting,” McCoy-Lawrence said in a statement. “This ruling erases the uncertainty voters might feel about whether their absentee ballot signature may not exactly match a previous one on record.”State Election Commission spokesman Chris Whitmire said the commission was appealing the part of the order that allows the court to approve signature verification procedures for absentee ballots.Lawyers for the state said during oral arguments last week that county boards would be acting unlawfully if they disqualified absentee ballots on the basis of mismatched voter signatures.Commission Executive Director Marci Andino said she was unaware of any counties with signature matching procedures in place, but a subsequent court-ordered survey she conducted of all 46 county election boards found at least nine of the boards were engaged in unauthorized signature matching.Although the majority of counties said they were not verifying signatures for ballots in this year’s general election, the few that did had what Gergel described as a “hodgepodge” of procedures. Some counties notified voters whose ballot signatures did not match those on their registration forms, while other counties disqualified the ballots.“The late discovery of these wildly inconsistent procedures, where a minority of counties are conducting some version of signature matching without the knowledge or approval of the State Election Commission and acting contrary to the Commission’s and its Executive Director’s plainly stated legal position that such procedures are unlawful under South Carolina law, raises a number of significant legal questions,” Gergel wrote.After compiling the survey results, Andino ordered counties Monday to stop signature matching and include ballots with signature issues to be counted with the other ballots.At least one county, Spartanburg, said it had stopped verifying signatures because it could not keep up with the volume of mail-in ballots received.As of noon Tuesday, 354,000 South Carolinians had voted absentee by mail, more than doubling the record number of mail-in ballots returned in the 2016 general election, according to the election commission. Another 584,000 people have already voted in person.That uptick follows rule changes put in place by the state legislature this fall allowing all voters to vote absentee regardless of reason because of the coronavirus pandemic. Voters in the state usually have to provide a specific reason for voting absentee, such as being 65 or older or having a physical disability.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

These results appear highly robust, because even if we changed model variables such as ocean depth, we got the same patterns, says Per Ahlberg, professor of evolutionary organismal biology at Uppsala University.
 Between 420 and 380 million years ago (Ma)  that is, during the end of one geological period, the Silurian, and beginning of the next, the Devonian  Earth was a completely different world from now. Instead of todays well-known continents there were other land masses, clustered in the Southern Hemisphere. Stretching across the South Pole was the huge continent of Gondwana.
 North of it was another big one known as Laurussia, and squeezed between the two were a few small continents.
 Other salient differences compared with now were that Earths day lasted only 21 hours, since our planet revolved faster on its own axis, and the Moon looked much larger because its orbit was closer to Earth.
 Life on land had gradually begun to get established. But the vertebrates, then consisting only of various kinds of fish, were still to be found only in the oceans. Then, during the Devonian, immense diversification of fish took place. One group to emerge was the bony fish, which make up more than 95 per cent of all fish today but were also the ancestors of terrestrial vertebrates.
 The earliest bony fish were the first animals to evolve lungs. What set off the evolution of bony fish, and how some of them started to adapt to a life on land, has not been clarified. One theory is that it happened in tidal environments where, in some periods, fish had been isolated in pools as a result of particularly large tides.
 This challenging habitat may have driven the evolution of lungs and, later on, the transformation of fins into front and hind legs.
 To test this tidal theory, researchers at Uppsala University, in collaboration with colleagues from the Universities of Oxford and (in Wales) Bangor, used an established mathematical model of the tidal system for the first time to simulate, in detail, the tides in the Late Silurian and Early Devonian.
 Data on the positions of the continents, the distance of the Moon, the duration of Earths day, our planets gravity and the physical properties of seawater were fed into the model. These simulations showed unequivocally that the period, just like that of the present day, was one when large tides occurred in some places.
 The small continent of South China on the Equator showed a difference of more than four metres in sea level between high and low tide. The existence of tides at the time has previously been verified through studies of geological strata, but determining the extent of the difference between low and high tide has not been feasible.
 To researchers this news has been interesting, since fossil finds indicate that it was specifically around South China that bony fish originated.
 Our results open the door to further and even more detailed tidal analyses of key episodes in Earths past. The method can be used to explore the possible role of tides in other evolutionary processes of vertebrate development. And perhaps, conversely, whether tides, with their influence on ocean dynamics, played a part in the big marine extinctions that have taken place again and again in Earths history, Ahlberg says.

Such decisions would pose an immense cultural challenge for the Army, however. When defense budgets contracted during the sequestration era, the Army’s active and reserve components engaged in an all-out bureaucratic war that can only be characterized as fratricide, leading Congress to charter an independent commission to referee the fight. The Army, and the country more broadly, cannot afford to repeat that experience. As the Army chief of staff, Gen. James McConville faces the daunting task of managing this countercultural change. He should do so by ensuring that active, reserve, and Guard forces all have an equal seat at any table where cuts are considered. And after tough decisions have been made behind closed doors, all of the Army’s senior leaders should emerge with a unified approach that emphasizes the needs of the entire Army rather than any of its individual components.

From there, Booster and Terry teleport back into the past to Bruce before he can have a telepathic suggestion implanted in his mind to turn him into a killer - but they can’t actually make contact with him or risk destabilizing the future. The arrival of the main villain of the issue is a surprise - it’s Blanque, the evil telepathic supervillain who was the arch-nemesis of the older Superman from the pre-Flashpoint world. The events of Superman Beyond made that timeline irrelevant, but Jurgens remembers his creation and brought him back for one last hurrah. Blanque was always a strong villain, kind of like a supervillain Hannibal Lecter minus the cannibalism. But it’s another unexpected reunion when Terry rescues a little boy from a fire that provides the issue’s biggest surprise. The plot moves so fast it’s a bit dizzying, but I think Batman Beyond is headed for a strong finish.

The figures in the House races are only slightly less amazing, especially when you consider that if Democrats win both seats they could gain control of the House.
 Incumbent Walt Blackman has raised a respectable $111,000, of which he’s already spent $102,000. Dark money groups have spent another $48,000 on his behalf. However, the really surprising number comes in the form of the $698,000 outside, dark money groups have spent against him. That means the outside groups — including Democratic Party groups — have spent nearly seven times as much as he’s raised.
 Blackman has blasted the dark money spending attacks, saying groups like Opportunity Arizona have slandered him by making false claims that the Bronze Star recipient attended “lavish trips funded by lobbyists” as well as implying that he used campaign funds for “an apartment in Phoenix.”
 “I guess when all else fails, they planned to just start making things up. I’ve never attended any so-called ‘lavish trips’ nor do I have an apartment in Phoenix. Arizonans feel this kind of politics cheapens the process and most of us are tired of it,” said Blackman in a press release.
 In fact, many of the dark money attacks on all the candidates have been loaded with false or misleading claims — especially against French. Reformers have complained that the lack of disclosures of dark money donors means that misleading attack ads have poisoned the political atmosphere, without making candidates or identified organizations take responsibility.
 The dark money donations have dominated all of the other House races as well.
 Brenda Barton — who gave up the seat due to term limits and now wants it back — has raised $48,600 — much closer to the historical average for the seat. She has spent about $11,000. However, Independent Expenditure groups have spent $72,000 on her behalf and $107,000 opposing her. So the outside groups have spent three times as much as the candidate.
 Democrat Coral Evans has raised $556,000 and spent $288,000. That’s a huge sum for a House candidate. Moreover, dark money groups have spent $401,000 to support her and $83,000 opposing her.
 That leaves Art Babbott, the Coconino County Supervisor running as an independent. He’s raised $80,000 — pretty good in a normal year. He’s spent $42,000. But here’s where he differs. No dark money groups have spent money on his behalf. On the other hand, independent expenditure groups have spent $119,000 against him.
 Makes him sound almost, well, Independent.
 All told, the four House candidates themselves have raised $800,000 and disclosed the donors as required by state law. The dark money groups have so far spent $1.4 million, both for and against the candidates. However, state law does not require the dark money groups to disclose their donors or the groups they represent.
 A citizen’s group tried to get on the ballot a measure that would require dark money groups to disclose their donors, interests and spending — but the backers abandoned the effort when the pandemic made it too difficult to gather signatures. A previous effort to force disclosure of dark money sources failed narrowly, buried in a wave of opposition spending supported by dark money groups.

This change will not affect our non-GAAP income before income taxes, actual cash tax payments or cash flows, but will result in a higher or lower non-GAAP provision for income taxes depending on the level and jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income and available U.S. research and development tax credits. As of June 30, 2020, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $287 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of $156 million. We do not expect to pay substantial taxes on a GAAP basis in the U.S. and certain other foreign jurisdictions for the foreseeable future due to our net operating loss carryforward balances. Over the near term, most of our cash taxes will continue to be mainly driven by the tax expense of our foreign subsidiaries which amounts have not historically been significant. We also believe our long-term effective GAAP tax rate will be lower than the U.S. statutory rate based upon our established tax structure.

In its eight-year history, Charlotte football has yet to face an in-state ACC opponent. That changes Saturday when the 49ers head into the heart of the league's "Big Four" country.
 Charlotte (2-2) has a Halloween date with Duke (1-5) at 7 p.m. in Wallace Wade Stadium, in Durham. It's also a chance for the 49ers -- even in an empty stadium -- to showcase their brand to a part of the state that hasn't seen them yet as a Football Bowl Subdivision program. Charlotte was supposed to play its first in-state ACC team earlier this season against North Carolina in Chapel Hill on Sept. 19, but the game was canceled due to the coronavirus.
 "It is big to get up in that Raleigh-Durham area and Duke is a team that everybody across the country respects," 49ers coach Will Healy said. "But we've got to go play well. I think that's what the biggest deal is. You can help your brand if you put a good product on the field. It's important for us to continue to make waves in this state."
 The 49ers have played "Power 5" teams at least once a season since they moved up from the NCAA's Football Championship Subdivision and joined Conference USA in 2015. They're 0-2 against ACC opponents, losing 70-14 to Louisville in 2016 and 52-10 at Clemson in 2019.
 "It's a great opportunity to go and keep establishing our program," Charlotte receiver Victor Tucker said. "A win versus an ACC opponent would be very big, for recruiting and just the confidence of the team to know that we can go out and beat anybody. So I think it'd be a huge, huge thing for Charlotte football."

Even after women won the right to vote in 1920 and senators were popularly elected, the United States remained a republic. Over the past several decades, senators became more dependent on the party for funding and support than the state each represented. As a result, many senators grew ambivalent about loyalty to the party or, as originally intended, to the state. Party as opposed to state loyalty has contributed to making gridlock almost permanent as politics became more rigid. And to Republicans, Trump is the party. That both parties have moved much further to left and right has affected this dual loyalty.

 “Our boy is coming back home,” said an elated Bangladesh T20 captain Mahmudullah, which is the collective mood of country’s cricketing fraternity. We know that Shakib has been the best player for so many years, for the Bangladesh cricket team. We are all eagerly waiting for his return to the dressing room,” Mahmudullah was quoted as saying by ESPN Cricinfo.
 “It feels good to know that we can see him, talk to him and spend time with him,” he added.
 The 33-year-old all-rounder is currently in the United States with his family and is expected to return to Bangladesh early next month.
 “Shakib is a champion player. I think it won’t take him long to get back to rhythm. I believe that he will get it back as soon as he enters the cricket field,” said Mahmudullah, who has been playing international cricket along side Shakib for the last 13 years.
 “The biggest thing is that we can fill up the gap that his absence had created. He always makes important contributions with the bat and ball.”
 Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) chief selector Minhajul Abedin said Shakib will be eased into the international scene through the domestic route.
 “Our best player is coming back to the field. He now has to prepare himself for domestic tournaments since we don’t have any international series for the time being,” Abedin said. “We have to monitor his physical condition. Let him start in domestic cricket. We should give him time but he is a very experienced player. He won’t take long to get back into rhythm,” he said.
 Abedin admitted that Bangladesh badly missed Shakib during the last one year. “We definitely missed him. He is one of the best all-rounders in the world and there are so few of them these days. We are lucky to have a batting all- rounder like him, which gives us a lot of advantage.”

The crisis — part of a deadly comeback by the virus across nearly the entire U.S. — has created one of the most desperate hot spots in North America and underscored how intricately connected the two cities are economically, geographically and culturally, with lots of people routinely going back and forth across the border to shop or visit with family.
 “We are like Siamese cities,” said Juarez resident Roberto Melgoza Ramos, whose son recovered from a bout of COVID-19 after taking a cocktail of homemade remedies and prescription drugs. “You can’t cut El Paso without cutting Juarez, and you can’t cut Juarez without cutting El Paso.”
 In El Paso, authorities have instructed residents to stay home for two weeks and imposed a 10 p.m. curfew, and they are setting up dozens of hospital beds at a convention center. Also, the University Medical Center of El Paso erected heated isolation tents to treat coronavirus patients. As of Tuesday, Ryan Mielke, director of public affairs, said the hospital had 195 COVID-19 patients, compared with fewer than three dozen less than a month ago, and “it continues to grow by the day, by the hour.”
 In Juarez, the Mexican government is sending mobile hospitals, ventilators and doctors, nurses and respiratory specialists. A hospital is being set up inside the gymnasium of the local university to help with the overflow.
 Juarez has reported more than 12,000 infections and over 1,100 deaths, but the real numbers are believed to be far higher, because COVID-19 testing is extremely limited. El Paso County recorded about 1,400 new cases Tuesday, just short of the previous day's record of 1,443. The county had 853 patients hospitalized for the virus on Monday, up from 786 a day earlier.
 Last week, Chihuahua, which includes Juarez, became the only state in Mexico to return to its highest level health alert, or red, under which most nonessential services are shut down and people are encouraged to stay home.
 A curfew is also in effect in Juarez, but it has proved difficult to enforce in the sprawling city that is home to hundreds of factories that manufacture appliances, auto parts and other products around the clock.
 The U.S. and Mexico agreed months ago to restrict cross-border traffic to essential activity, but there has been little evidence Mexico has blocked anyone from entering. Other Mexican border cities have complained about people entering from U.S. cities that are suffering from virus outbreaks.
 Dr. Hector Ocaranza, the city and county health authority in El Paso, said the heavily Latino city's family-based culture has been a contributing factor in the spread. People under 40 are going to work and participating in other activities, then checking on older relatives and spreading the virus to them, he said.
 Those hospitalized are mostly over 60, but young adults make up nearly half of the total case count, Ocaranza said.

The real investment case to play out is that of the secular trends and the projections made, with addressable markets and thus revenue targets tripling between now and let's say a year or 6 from here.
 So let's do some math. Based on Ansys' projections of its end markets nearly tripling by 2027, I see potential for earnings to triple as well, let's say by 2027/2028. In such a scenario, earnings per share might improve to about $20, or perhaps $22 if we assume that retained earnings allows for continuation of reduction in the share count.
 Assuming valuation multiples narrow, with the premium dissolving to some extent, as the law of large numbers will probably put some pressure on the growth rate of the business, I value this earnings power at a 20-25 times multiple at such a point in time, for a valuation between $440 and $550 per share.
 Compared to a current value of $320, this leaves a potential annual return of around 4-7%, perhaps interesting, but not interesting enough to create a compelling risk-reward, in my book.

One of the biggest downsides of United is its high exposure to international markets. Out of four legacy carriers in the US, United has the largest chunk of revenues coming from overseas. Since most borders are still closed to this day, it’s very doubtful that United will be able to show a meaningful international performance in the following months.
 What’s even worse is that United’s domestic network is also very unstable. While a few months ago its peers started to aggressively add capacity to strengthen competitive advantages in their major markets, United decided to play it safe and didn’t significantly increase its flights in comparison to others. As a result, other airlines are now slowly establishing a stronger foothold in United’s major hubs. For example, Southwest (LUV) recently announced that it will expand further in Chicago and Houston, while JetBlue (JBLU) has been increasing its presence in Newark. Considering this, United will now itself need to dramatically increase its capacity to prevent others from expanding on its home turf. However, with a low load factor and a lack of finances and growth perspectives, it will be even harder to do so now.
 With all of that in mind, we believe that it will be hard for United to compete and thrive in the following months. In addition to a large debt burden and increased interest payment, United also needs to increase its expenses and add more flights in order to retain its market share in its major hubs. However, even if it manages to do so, it will not return to its pre-pandemic profitability levels in the foreseeable future. For that reason, we stick to our opinion that United is uninvestable at this stage and there are better stocks to own.
