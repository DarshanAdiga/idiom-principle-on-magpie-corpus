“Have you read this?” the 61-year-old man asked his newest doctor, Madan Jagasia, as they sat in an exam room in the cancer center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. The book, titled “Dying Well,” prompted a concerned look from the oncologist. You know we’re not there yet, he said he told the patient. Jagasia had only recently taken over the patient’s care, but he knew the man had been through an awful 14 months. Just a few weeks before Christmas in 2016, the athletic and active lawyer discovered he had an aggressive leukemia. (Sanders, 3/18)

Thanks to the Broadway Knights and especially to George Dejong’s wife Barbara Wagner, I can even have the Broadway Knights come to my home’
 The March 24 performance is still viewable to the public on Facebook, via George DeJong or Greg Wollaston’s Facebook page.
 Broadway Knights, the trio, will perform another Living Room Concert Live! at 7 p.m. Tuesday. Viewers can watch via Facebook live stream (George DeJong or Greg Wollaston) and also on You Tube, live streaming as “Broadway Knights.”
 Thanks to PayPal, there is even a virtual tip jar so I can make a contribution to the musicians. I have used PayPal for several transactions over the years and nothing could be easier ... just type in your credit card information which is all coded in some way for your safety and you can easily “pay the pipers”
 Barbara said they had viewers from all over the U.S. and not just Venice last Tuesday. Their next live performance will be from 7-8 p.m. Tuesday on Facebook.
 Anyone with access to Facebook can watch. Just go to the George DeJong or Greg Wollaston page on Facebook.
 Barbara said that the audience that first night indicated that “music is a healing force we all need right now, and that even via the internet, people appreciate having live music available.
 “With live streaming, the broadcast was interactive: people could comment and make requests, and George and Greg were aware of most of the feedback as it was happening. The perfect solution to an imperfect situation. And, musicians able to continue doing what they love!
 “My living room never ‘sounded’ better! I was thrilled to have it take place right between my couch and my curio cabinet!”
 I was even happier and thanks to my Powerbook and the internet I can have the Broadway Knights entertain me at home, safe from that awful virus that is out and about in the world right now.
 Barbara said she is working to put that first broadcast on YouTube.
 As for the virtual tip jar — just be sure to use the characters as shown (upper and lower case etc.) — PayPal.Me/gdj313. It is easy and secure.
 While I won’t be able to see you there on Tuesday, I will be on my Powerbook and encourage you to join me for a great virtual concert by the Broadway Knights on Facebook. Sign on to Facebook and then go to George DeJong or Greg Wollaston, sit back and enjoy the music and if you make a request such as “Henry the VIII” it is likely to be granted. And I will grin from ear to ear as that is one of my most favorite songs.

According to a report from time magazine out this past weekend, a woman by the name of Danni Askini went to the hospital, tested positive for coronavirus after several trips to the emergency room at the suggestion of her doctor. And then at the end of all this, after the coronavirus testing, coronavirus treatment, received a bill for just a few dollars shy of $35,000. Now according to reports, Ms Askini did not have health insurance, so this was the price that she had to pay or was asked to pay straight up out of pocket, $35,000. Now here's the thing. This story is not unique. In fact, the Kaiser family foundation, let me, I'll just read it. This is from the Hill. The story of her bill comes as the Kaiser family foundation has released a study predicting the average cost of coronavirus treatment for someone with insurance and without health complications would total around $9,763 and treatment for someone with complications could top $20,000. That's with insurance. If you have health insurance and say you have a preexisting condition or you get coronavirus and, you know, it gets kind of bad for you, you're going to be looking at over $20,000 in hospital bills. Folks, this is not sustainable and this story highlights every possible thing that is wrong with the current healthcare system here in the United States, and I know we have some people out there, Joe Biden's one of them, saying that no, all coronavirus testing should be free and all treatment should be free for this one disease.

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) on Saturday said it was focusing on high disease-burden hotspots and working in tandem with states to implement rigorous contact-tracing, community surveillance and containment strategies as the number of novel coronavirus cases crossed the 900-mark in the country.The number of coronavirus cases climbed to 918 in India on Saturday, while the death toll remained at 19. As many as 149 new COVID-19 cases, including two deaths, have been reported since Friday.“Combined efforts are on to ensure 100 per cent lockdown and that social distancing gets implemented,” Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, MoHFW, said at a press briefing in New Delhi.The government is working with states on health infrastructure preparedness and the focus is on having dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and blocks in every state.Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the ICMR Raman R Gangakhedkar said all patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) are being tested for the coronavirus infection, according to the revised?guidelines of COVID-19.Refuting the possibility of community transmission, Gangakhedkar said that they have just started testing SARI cases.There are some sporadic instances where people are not revealing their?exposure history but their numbers are not significant that we take it that the virus is spreading rapidly, Gangakhedkar said.Till the time we see a significant number of cases to indicate community transmission, let us not over interpret things, he said. ? Over Indias testing capacity, he said said 111 government laboratories are currently functional across the country and with the private sector being roped in, it has been increased.Agarwal said arrangements were being made to ramp up isolation and Intensive Care Unit beds and other required logistics.The joint secretary said 17 states have so far started work on this and doctors are being provided online training by their counterparts at the AIIMS New Delhi on the management of COVID-19 patients.A series of online trainings for nursing officers will be conducted by AIIMS in the next 5-7 days.This includes training in caring for patients and suspected cases of COVID-19, he said.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday inaugurated a 24x7 national tele-consultation centre at the AIIMS through which doctors in other hospitals and medical colleges will be provided clinical guidance on managing COVID-19 patients.We have been pre- emptive and graded in our approach and had anticipated the situation much before, and went for a lockdown when we were getting limited cases of local transmission while other countries took steps much later, he said, adding that results will be known only after a few days.(with quotes from PTI, ANI)

At some point, football will return and ideally, everything would carry on as it did before but in the real world that is simply not going to happen.
 On balance, Arsenal was a team with momentum, they were unbeaten domestically since the turn of the year and FA Cup glory and a European qualifying spot via the league were all very attainable.
 The trajectory that Arsenal was taking under Mikel Arteta was upwards and while I do expect that to continue in the long term, there is no knowing what the short term holds.
 Arsenal will return from the enforced break in one of three ways, they will either continue down the unbeaten road, they will come back and have a set of mixed results or they will come back and do a worse than they were doing prior to the outbreak.
 It is the last one that is the biggest danger, losing the momentum that had been built up could have far-reaching effects.
 It would put Mikel Arteta almost back to square one, it would undo all the good work in rebuilding confidence and morale and the Spaniard will have to begin picking up the pieces once again.
 In reality, Arsenal has more to lose than it has to gain once the season returns, they were already moving upwards and anything other than that would not be good for the club.

"Tutti i locali degli ospedali dell’Asp di Siracusa - dicono dall'Asp - vengono sottoposti a sanificazione nel caso in cui personale sanitario risulti positivo al tampone. Anche il personale asintomatico viene sottoposto a tampone. In atto la situazione è sotto controllo e a tal proposito si ribadisce ancora una volta ai cittadini la necessità di ricorrere al pre triage in caso di sindrome influenzale, evitando col proprio senso civico il rischio di potere infettare personale sanitario e altri pazienti. Il pronto soccorso rimarrà aperto grazie all’impiego di altro personale che verrà trasferito da altri reparti dello stesso presidio per sostituire i colleghi ricoverati o posti in quarantena in qualsiasi reparto dalle cardiologie ai pronto soccorso".

The latest landmark came only two days after the world passed half a million infections, according to a tally by John Hopkins University, showing that much work remains to be done to slow the spread of the virus. It showed more than 607,000 cases and over 28,000 deaths.
 While the U.S. now leads the world in reported infections — with more than 104,000 cases — five countries exceed its roughly 1,700 deaths: Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France.
 Doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers in its worst-hit regions are working nonstop and falling ill at an alarming rate. More than 9,000 health workers in the country have been infected.
 "We are completely overwhelmed," said paramedic Pablo Rojo at Barcelona's Dos de Maig hospital. "Seven or eight (patients transported today) and all with COVID-19. ... And the average age is decreasing. They're not 80 years old anymore, they are now 30 and 40 years old."
 "Sometimes you become a bit paranoid, you don't know any more when you pick up the phone if you have cleaned your hands, if you've sanitized them or not. You touch your face with your hands," Rojo said.
 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and lead to death.
 More than 130,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins.
 The effects of the outbreak have been felt by the powerful and the poor alike.
 On Friday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first leader of a major country to test positive for the virus. He said he would continue to work from self-quarantine.

Ragusa, 28 marzo 2020 - Spiace comunicare la morte di un paziente di 71 anni di Ragusa ricoverato da alcuni giorni in malattie infettive e da ieri trasferito, in terapie intensiva a causa dell'aggravarsi delle sue condizioni. Al momento quindi i ricoverati sono 8 compreso uno in terapia intensiva le cui condizioni sono stabili se pur gravi. Sono risultati negativi i tamponi di due persone decedute presso una casa di riposo del territorio.   In ordine alle notizie allarmistiche diffuse da una paziente ricoverata, e ribaltate sui social e su vari blog, la direzione di presidio a seguito di un paziente "sospetto CoViD19" risultato negativo ai primi test, e poi risultato invece positivo e trasferito a Modica, ha applicato tutte le procedure codificate nei protocolli, considerato che questi casi sono ovviamente previsti.Il personale che ha avuto contatto con il paziente e stato sottoposto a tampone e temporaneamente posto a riposo in attesa dell'esito. I primi due tamponi esitati su medici dell'Ospedale di Ragusa che hanno gestito il paziente sono risultati negativi.  Aumenta a 4 il numero delle persone precedentemente positive che si sono negativizzate. Da lunedi, secondo le indicazioni dell'Assessore  Regionale della Salute, informato costantemente della situazione della Provincia, avranno inizio i prelievi dei tamponi alle persone in isolamento che singolarmente saranno chiamate e con la loro auto se disponibili potranno recarsi a Ragusa per effettuare il tampone senza scendere dall'auto.Questo consentira di velocizzare le procedure, effettuare piu tamponi e dedicare il personale per le visite a domicilio per le persone piu fragili e non autonome.  Raccomandiamo, in previsione di un aumento dei casi in tutta la Regione e anche nella provincia di Ragusa, di rispettare rigidamente le regole dell'isolamento. Elenco 28/marzo/2020: 28 positivi (8 ricoverati), 4 negativizzati, 1 decesso

Italy's nationwide lockdown is showing the first small signs of payoff. The number of coronavirus cases is still rising, but at the lowest day-on-day pace since the outbreak began. The World Health Organization calls the slowdown encouraging. The health chief in the hardest-hit region says there's "light at the end of the tunnel." The temptation, for a cooped-up and stressed-out country, is to embrace the first sign that the crisis may at last be easing. (Harlan and Pitrelli, 3/26)

Teams of doctors and engineers from NC hospitals and local universities are working around the clock to mass-produce face shields they designed using 3-D printing and injection molding technology.
 “Our goal is simple: we want Health Care Workers to use the Hashtag #GetMeAltPPE, and use www.AltPPE.me to let us know their need. We will send them as many face shields as possible.”
 "What we need is for health systems and practices, especially the ones that don't have reliable access... to the traditional PPE supply chain to use this website to be connected to those producers," said Dr. Azalea Kim, an Organizer with #GetMeAltPPE and practicing physician in Durham.  "This equipment has been clinically vetted.  The design stood up to rigorous clinical use testing in emergency departments and ICUs at Atrium Health.  There has been constant clinical feedback from the start."  
 It was an enterprising team from Charlotte Latin school that launched the work in Charlotte, including a successful GoFundMe that fueled the ability to bring the design to reality.  
 Top Universities including UNCC, UNC Chapel Hill, NC State, and Duke are combining their efforts to meet the demand. Dr. Kim stresses that these are not masks, but shields. Health Care Workers would still wear masks, but also place a shield over their faces-- allowing the workers to wear the masks for an extended amount of time. The teams are working on designs to address other PPE shortages.
 Any health care organization, including hospitals, practices, nursing homes, hospice organizations can visit HERE and fill out the simple form to request shields that are ramping up for production this week.

At the time, it sounded almost too horrible to take seriously. “A billion people would get sick," he said. “As many as 165 million people would die. There would be a global recession and depression, and the cost to our economy of $1 to $3 trillion would be far worse for everyone than merely 100 million people dying, because so many more people would lose their jobs and their health care benefits, that the consequences are almost unthinkable.” (Levy, 3/19)
