Robinson came up with the title as “sort of a wink,” she said. “I like to joke that, in my life, I’m not getting full reparations, but I’m getting these tiny moments of reparations.” Those include Bono sending her flowers on her birthday (she’s obsessed with U2) or her white friends hailing cabs for her.
 Amid some intense recent conversation over _the book industry’s shortcomings in supporting emerging writers of color_ , she wants to pay those reparations forward. The #PublishingPaidMe hashtag that surfaced on Twitter in mid-June referenced an anonymous _spreadsheet_ in which predominantly white authors shared the advances they earned for book deals.
 The spreadsheet highlights major discrepancies between the advances received by Black and non-Black authors. Although Robinson’s imprint had been in the works since early February and the announcement had already been planned for July, the current reckoning across many fields made the time feel ripe.
 “I think the publishing industry is hearing — I think they are more receptive to the sort of critique that’s being presented to them, and they’re more willing to make those changes,” she said. “And I think it is up to people like me to make sure those changes keep happening.”

Long story short, although it's true that pollsters underestimated the share of Trump's base that would turn out in 2016, it may be nothing more than a late break towards an intriguing outsider by undecideds in the final weeks of the campaign that accounts for the big miss in Michigan and other Rust Belt states. It could happen that late deciders break for him again this November, confounding the numbers a second time, but there's no obvious reason to think so given the problems bedeviling the country and the weaker degree of animosity Biden inspires in people relative to Clinton. Besides, says Nate Silver, even if Trump outperforms his polling again this year, he'd have to outperform it by a lot -- a _lot_ -- in light of how things currently stand in order to actually win the election.

Some others got on board, though, after major corporations began to look askance at the only state still flying the Rebel banner, and sports organizations vowed not to sponsor events in Mississippi as long as it kept the flag.
 Some of my relatives, friends and acquaintances who are upset by shelving images of the Confederacy say you can’t change history.
 They’re right in that you can’t change the past, but writers and teachers of history can shape it to an erroneous perception.
 I have heard it said since childhood that the Civil War was fought over states’ rights, unfair tariffs and such, and that slavery wasn’t the primary issue.
 That’s not true. Go on the internet and read Mississippi’s “declaration of the immediate causes which induce and justify the secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union.”
 Slavery is first and foremost the subject of the declaration, which asserted that a “blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization.”
 So, when is it going to stop now that the flag is down? Protesters are demanding removal of statues, and renaming streets and sports teams in the name of racial justice.
 I frankly don’t know, but I hope it ends pretty soon. Some of the most zealous on the left seem to be like the man who didn’t want all the land in the county — just that next to him. Meaning the more he got, the more he wanted.
 I can understand the argument for moving a Confederate statue from a courthouse, supposedly the seat of justice, to a museum, but I can’t fathom why anyone would want to tear down monuments to men who founded this country, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson; or Lincoln and Grant, who helped free slaves, although at some point in their lives they may not have been politically correct in today’s environment.
 If everyone has to be perfect to deserve one, then there will be no monuments.

In three end-of-term decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has elevated religious liberty – which was taken up in legislation in the 1990s to offer protections to Native American religions – and weighted the rights of Christians above those of women and LGBTQ Americans. The rulings come amid a rapidly changing U.S. society, where a majority of Americans believe in equal rights for LGBTQ Americans and fewer Americans identify as religious.
 “Traditional religious believers certainly feel under attack,” says Vincent Phillip Muñoz. “I mean, there’s been a huge cultural shift over the last handful of years, an increasing acceptance of LGBT rights, and for many traditional religious believers, they worry that their beliefs are no longer welcome, or even will no longer be tolerated.”
 “Whether they’re right in worrying about that or not, only time will tell,” continues Professor Muñoz. “But certainly that’s a fear social conservatives have.”
 Some liberal-leaning scholars question whether the legacies of religious bigotry are necessarily similar to those surrounding racism and white supremacy. “It’s really not exactly the same thing in a lot of ways,” says Professor Jessie Hill. “One of which, and the most obvious is, Catholics have tremendous political and cultural power right now.”

An eventful U.S. Supreme Court term ended yesterday less with a bang than perhaps the thud of a beginner’s constitutional law textbook closing.
 In two principles-heavy opinions Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by almost all of his eight colleagues, wrote that President Donald Trump can’t block subpoenas seeking years of his personal financial records from third parties.
 To some experts, the opinions showed the high court standing up for the rule of law in general and emphasizing the specific point that no president is above it.
 “The legal conclusions of the Court were really ‘Law School 101,’” wrote Kimberly West-Faulcon, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, in an email. “They read to me a bit like the Supreme Court trying to bring President Trump up to speed on how Presidents have behaved over the last 200 years.”
 The president can continue to plead his case in lower courts, and the financial records are expected to remain secret until after the election in November.

“Just like with ‘2 Dope Queens,’ Tiny Reparations Books is really a space where I accept everybody,” Robinson told The Times in a phone interview earlier this week. “Everyone is welcome. Everyone’s story is valid, everyone has the right to speak out and share what they’ve learned, and share their lives and share their creativity.”
 “2 Dope Queens,” which Robinson cohosted with comedian Jessica Williams, featured a diverse roster of guests, from _Aparna Nancherla_ to _Chris Garcia_. The new imprint will follow suit, curating a selection of underrepresented voices.
 “I really want to pick and choose the things I think represent the brand, but also push it forward and make society better,” Robinson said. “Because I’m going to be publishing a smaller collection of books, it’s also like tiny reparations here in that each book would be like a little bright spot, hopefully, in the world.” She hopes to start by publishing four books a year.
 An imprint like this has been an “active dream” of Robinson’s since she first sat down with her literary agent, Robert Guinsler, in 2014 — before she even wrote her first book. Two books later, when she brought the idea to her publisher, Plume (a division of Penguin Random House), Tiny Reparations Books was born. The project shares its name with her _production company_.

Fourth, there is the logistical nightmare of it all. The UTD semester starts August 17; that is only a little more than a month away. Keep in mind that most international students are graduate students. In other words, rather than 18- to 22-year-olds who might be able to move in with Mom and Dad if things go badly in the U.S., many graduate students are grown adults (often married, sometimes with kids). They generally uproot their entire lives to come here and study. Not a few have quit jobs back home -- the ship has sailed, the bridge has burned. By July, many students will have rented an apartment, usually on a one-year lease that cannot be canceled without forfeiting a fortune. They have chosen their classes (maybe all online ones -- “Uh oh, not anymore,” some are thinking. “Will I still graduate on time, before the money runs out? Will the class I need be available in person? If so, will there be room for me?”). Some have even bought a car and taken the U.S. driving test. On top of all that, their home countries may not be allowing people in from the U.S. (since we apparently cannot control COVID-19), and for those that are, the reduced flights available the midst of a pandemic are often insanely expensive. Losing everything at the drop of a hat in accordance with the whims of Trump’s twitter feed or ICE’s professional xenophobes could mean de facto homelessness.

Another reason for what she says is Democratic fear of complacency. Every time a new poll drops showing Biden up 10 points, two groups of people scream. One is Republican activists (led by the president himself), who holler, "Suppression poll! They're trying to demoralize us so that we stay home!" The other is Democratic activists, who holler, "Complacency poll! They're trying to convince us that the race is in the bag so that we stay home!" I think that's partly what's driving Elissa Slotkin's suspicions here. She's understandably spooked that her home state of Michigan, which was supposed to be safely blue in 2016, might have another surprise waiting for Democrats. And she has special reason to fear it, as her home district leans slightly Republican (R+4). She was one of the purple-district Dems who swept to victory in the blue wave two years ago. Then she turned around and voted to impeach last year, pissing off the Republican majority in her district. She's sending a signal here to Democrats in her district: _I need every vote on Election Day to survive. Assume nothing based on the polls._

If there is a cue with an arc that's over three or four minutes or longer, the music falls out. [Mavromichalis] uses music like paint. I wrote big suites of music from my heart about all the elements of 'Olympia' that touched me. He would then cut them up and place to picture as he wished, like paint on his canvas. Writing score to try and hit something on the nose doesn't produce music that is as valid as writing my impressions of a character.

The first offer came from Rebels’ head basketball coach Kermit Davis, who stgarted his coaching career started at Southwest Mississippi Community College. Gazzo attended a camp at Ole Miss put on by Davis, who noticed Gazzo’s potential.
 “He saw my talent and he wanted me to come to a camp with all of the top talent in the state and he really liked me and it just went on from there,” he said.
 Gazzo said the offer caught him caught off guard.
 “I was at a pitching lesson and I was in a parking lot and I called Coach Kermit Davis and they offered me a scholarship,” he said.
 Two weeks after getting the basketball offer, Gazzo was delivered the news that the Rebel baseball team also wanted him to join.
 “I was at a baseball tournament in Atlanta and we had just gotten done with the game and then right when we left the field, (Assistant) Coach (Carl) Lafferty called me and we talked for a while and he said that we are offering you a scholarship to Ole Miss,” he said. “It was just crazy and I was so excited about it.”
 Gazzo said he also has received a baseball offer from Georgia State and has recently gained interest in baseball from other schools such as Auburn and Texas A&M.
 As far as making it work with a student athlete playing two different sports that may overlap each other, it is something that the coaches are willing to work with. Gazzo said Lafferty knew of the basketball offer and the baseball offer came after communication between the two coaching staffs.
 “He was in contact with the basketball offices and they are both on the same page and fine with me doing both,” he said.

SHENANDOAH VALLEY, Va. (WVIR) - Project Grows was awarded a $100,000 grant to bring local food to area schools. The two-year initiative includes agricultural education in Staunton and Waynesboro public schools and on the Project Grows farm in Verona.Representatives say so much of what they do is working with kids in person, but the pandemic has made that challenging.“Typically we would be in the cafeteria handing out produce, handing out vegetable tastings through our harvests of the month program and we can’t do that,” said Project Grows Director of Education Nichole Barrows. “So we’re trying to think creatively about how we can do that in the fall.”Project Grows Director of Food Access Megan Marshall expects to provide all of the key components of the grant despite COVID-19.“I think this COVID world that we’re living in has provided us with the unique opportunity,” she said. “To think outside the box and kind of figure out how far garden education can go when you can’t be in the garden physically with the kids.”Project Grows has taken their education online and continues to assist the schools in getting local food to children.Project GROWS Awarded $100,000 from USDA to Connect Schools and Local FoodsJULY 8, 2020STAUNTON, VIRGINIAProject GROWS is pleased to announce the recent award of $100,000 for Farm to School Initiatives from the Food and Nutrition Service of the United States Department of Agriculture.Connecting Schools to Local Foods Initiative by Project GROWS is a two-year, farm-to-school initiative that includes agricultural education such as in-school tastings of local, seasonal produce; curriculum integration of local food concepts; and place-based experiential learning in school gardens and farm contexts. The award will also support work to expand procurement of local foods into school systems through networking with local growers and suppliers.Nichole Barrows, Director of Education at Project GROWS says, “This award elevates our work to a strategic, cross- curriculum and multi-age initiative. This award supports partnerships with schools to integrate local food education and food access from preschool through grade 12.”“We want to recognize Amanda Warren, Director of Nutrition Services and Dr. Jelisa Coltrane Wolfe, Executive Director of Student Services, Dixon Educational Center, Staunton City Schools as well as Tammy Coffey, School Nutrition Supervisor of Waynesboro Public Schools. “These leaders bring expertise and passion to this initiative,” says Megan Marshall, Director of Food Access at Project GROWS.“We believe that the garden is an ideal setting to create a safe and inspiring space for youth supporting their physical, mental, and social well-being, says Clara Metzler, Associate Director of Farm Operations at Project GROWS. " We know that kids who have a hand in growing their own vegetables in the garden LOVE to eat them! Bringing fresh local produce into our local school systems combined with nutrition education is helping to grow a new generation of engaged and healthy youth,” says Metzler.Project GROWS is a farm-based, nonprofit, public health, education and food access advocacy organization serving the Central Shenandoah Valley.More information about Project GROWS can be found at projectgrows.orgCopyright 2020 WVIR.

I am a Ph.D. student at the UTD, the leading destination for international students in the Lone Star State. My day job involves teaching English as a second language at UTD’s Naveen Jindal School of Management (named, I should note, for a former international student). The last few days have been rough for both my international Ph.D.-student friends and my own students, because F-1 visa holders are being unfairly hassled by ICE. Across the United States, international students have been hit -- completely out of the blue -- by the latest ill-conceived scheme from the Trump administration. On July 6, ICE/SEVP suddenly revised its guidelines for student visas with the intent to deport international students if their university were to attempt to protect their lives and health by moving all classes online during the fall in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The nature of this threat is bad enough, but the timing makes ICE’s move potentially catastrophic.

Making the most of any outdoor outing equates to a positive attitude and the ability to remain flexible. After all, we don't always catch a limit of fish or shoot a big whitetail buck but if we take the time to truly relish our time spent in the outdoors, we benefit by returning home rejuvenated and refreshed. A couple days spent last week with two great friends, Jeff Rice and Larry Weishuhn aka. "Mr. Whitetail" is a good case in point.
   
 We arrived at Jeff's Ranch near Lake Fork in the early afternoon, in time for Larry to get familiar with his new 50 caliber Dragon Claw air rifle. Larry is obviously a very experienced hunter but in his own words, "The last air rifle I shot was a Daisy BB gun"! He and I have hunted together in the past when I used my big bore air rifles to harvest hogs and exotics. I think when Larry saw the power of modern day PCP air rifles cleanly harvest game, his interest was sparked and just like myself about 9 years ago, he was anxious to learn about a completely new tool for harvesting game.
   
 A few of adjustments on the scope and Larry's new air rifle was shooting tight groups at 50 yards. Jeff had a couple of old archery targets set back to back and with the 3,000 psi. charge, the Dragon Claw was pushing the arrow completely through both targets. Larry left his first shooting session full of confidence and ready for the afternoon hog hunt.
   
 We settled into our blinds about 6 o'clock in the afternoon and need I explain how hot is can be in Texas in deep woods this time of year? Yes, it was sweltering but I was hunting from an old Snap Lock hunting blind that I have used for about 10 years and expectations were high for the opportunity to take a good 'eater' hog. I used the old blind on a lease close to home and have shot dozens of hogs from it and a couple of nice whitetail bucks. The blind is as solid today as the day I assembled it years ago and it was good to have it back in action on my buddy's ranch. Larry was hunting a ways down the creek with Jeff who was packing his video camera, hoping to get some footage of Larry taking his first big game animal with the power of air.
   
 My weapon of choice for this hunt was my trusty 45 caliber Texan air rifle by Airforce Airguns loaded with a 240 grain swaged bullet by Nielsen Specialty Ammo. A few months ago, I was slipping along on a still hunt and shot a hog in this location with the same rifle/bullet. Confidence was high but so was the temperature! Did I mention there was not a hint of a breeze?
   
 I could tell you about what goes on in a hunters mind while setting in a hot hunting blind during the hottest part of the day but let's just say the hogs were probably lounging in a cool section of the nearby creek, waiting for the cool of night and full moon to venture forth and enjoy their daily snack at the many corn feeders on Jeff's ranch.
   
 I met Larry and Jeff back at the camp house and, truth be known, I think maybe we were all a bit relieved that we didn't have to butcher a hog. Rather, we relaxed under some very cold air conditioning, sipped cool drinks and I 'layed out' our dinner meal. I had used my Smokin Tex electric smoker to slow smoke a side of pork ribs and a whole chicken back at home the previous day. I cut the chicken and ribs up, placed them in an aluminum pan and covered them with Best of Texas BBQ sauce. Ten minutes in the oven and dinner was served. Potato salad and camp beans seasoned with fresh garlic, onion and homemade chipotle peppers topped the meal off.
   
 We all came to the consensus that because of the heat and full moon, hogs would probably be feeding all night. I had packed another rifle topped with my Wraith day/night scope that I have used successfully on many night hunts but we were having so much fun talking over old times and making plans for future hunts that we all decided to eat BBQ and stay cool! Thirty years ago, we would have all probably spent the entire night in the woods but being the 'seasoned' hunters we are, the cool AC was feeling mighty good.
   
 Before turning in, we made a plan NOT to get up an hour before daylight and set in the blinds. Jeff had reconstructed a dock on his place that extends well out into the creek and set up a Sweeney Fish feeder I brought down a couple months ago. We felt confident that we could easily catch Larry a good 'mess' of tasty catfish to take back home and enjoy that evening with his wife.
   
 After a tasty breakfast prepared by our host the next morning, we made our way down to the dock. When the floating fish food hit the water's surface, at least a dozen good eating size channel catfish appeared and began scooping up their breakfast. Number 4 treble hooks baited with 'Stick It' bait placed about 4 foot below floaters was the ticket to catching a quick 'mess' of fish for Larry's dinner. With the catfish filleted and iced, it was time to show Larry the ranch.
   
 Jeff used his electric 'buggy' to quietly traverse some of the lanes he had cut through the woods and we saw numerous deer, including one buck that was already sporting some headgear that showed much promise. The porkers were obviously lounging somewhere in the bottoms in the cool creek water, after an evening of cleaning up all the corn from every feeder.
   
 Back at camp after our little photo shoot/scouting trip, we all packed up and vowed to return for round two with the hogs and catfish soon. Mr. Whitetail has now learned a new way of hunting with the power of air. He is already talking about joining me for a crack at a whitetail buck this fall with his Dragon Claw!

Part of what she says to Politico reporter Tim Alberta is common sense. Namely, if the polls could underestimate Trump's support in 2016, they can do it again. Most pollsters are more attentive this year to making sure that white voters without a college degree are properly represented in their samples, as that's the group that was undercounted in polling four years ago and ended up putting Trump over the top. Now that polling outfits are looking for them, they're less likely to be undercounted again. But no one knows how many casual voters in that group who typically don't turn out to vote will go to the polls for Trump this November. There may be more of them out there who didn't show up in 2016 but are planning to do so in the fall.
