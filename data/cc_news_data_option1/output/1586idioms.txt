ROME -- Deaths in Italy related to the coronavirus pandemic topped 25,000 on Wednesday.   The number of dead and new positives continue to plateau for Italy, the first western country to be hit by the crisis. The civil protection agency reported 437 people had died with the virus in the last 25 hours, a 1.7% increase in the death toll to 25,085. The number of positive cases rose 1.5% to 183,857.   Pressure on health services continued to ease, with fewer people both hospitalized and in intensive care. Italy's interior minister, meanwhile, confirmed that none of some 150 migrants rescued by an aid group and quarantined at sea have tested positive for the virus.

When it comes to battling the spread of the novel coronavirus, Kentucky and Rhode Island might look similar on paper. They’ve done comparable numbers of diagnostic tests and lost similar numbers of residents to the disease. But there’s one key difference. Kentucky has more than four times Rhode Island’s population, meaning it has tested 0.7 percent of its residents, compared with Rhode Island’s 3.7 percent, the highest per capita testing level in the United States.

“We don’t need to reinvent the wheel ourselves,” said Barbara Tully, president of Indiana Vote By Mail. “It’s been done by others, and we can learn from their mistakes, as vice-chairman [Anthony] Long said, and their successes, and build something that works for all Hoosier voters.”
 Democratic commission members Suzannah Wilson Overholt and Anthony Long offered amendments in the last commission meeting that would have offered several alternatives to voting in person, including a drive-up system where voters could submit ballots without leaving their cars. But these amendments failed on a party-line vote.
 Dee Ann Hart, speaking on behalf of the American Council of the Blind of Indiana, said the commission should also consider the needs of voters who have disabilities and who may face challenges in submitting an absentee ballot or in a vote-by-mail system.
 Chris Nardi, a member of the public who identified himself as a resident of Carmel, Indiana, and a sophomore politics major at Pomona College in Claremont, California, underscored Hart’s concern. He said it is difficult, if not impossible, for groups like Indiana’s homeless population to vote without an in-person option.
 “We should have some form of in-person voting for this election,” Nardi said. “For some members of our community, it is simply infeasible for them to vote by mail.”
 There will be in-person voting options on June 2 as well as early voting from May 26 to June 1.
 The commission will meet again before May 17 to reassess the COVID-19 crisis and, if necessary, to take additional steps to ensure voters can submit ballots in the primary. A date for the meeting has yet to be announced.

An heir to the Hot Pockets fortune who was sentenced to five months in prison in the college admissions bribery scheme asked a judge Wednesday to allow her to serve her punishment at home because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Lawyers for Michelle Janavs, who is supposed to report to prison next month, said in a legal filing that she has a health condition that makes her particularly vulnerable if she were to get the virus behind bars. Instead, she should spend five months in home confinement, her attorneys said.
 “If Ms. Janavs were to surrender to (Bureau of Prisons) custody, she is highly likely to become infected with COVID-19. And because of her underlying health condition, she faces a much higher risk than others of serious complications, hospitalization, or death from the virus,” her lawyers wrote.

Whether President Muhammadu Buhari’s departed Chief of Staff (CoS), Abba Kyari, was a good or bad man is beside the point. The real issue is that his five years in the government in which he served have further worsened the Nigerian condition.

Moon Jae-in Photo: Xinhua
 Since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office in 2017, the country's progressive and conservative parties have been in serious opposition. The two parties handicapped each other in the national assembly, making it difficult for the ruling party to carry out its foreign policy. In the 21st legislative election held on April 15, the ruling Democratic Party of Korea won a landslide victory. This gives the Moon administration the ability to push forward its foreign policy.      South Korea's foreign policy toward the US will not see big adjustments. The country will still make its alliance with the US the cornerstone of its foreign policy and security, and further consolidate it. However, in terms of military and political diplomacy, South Korea may not tilt too much toward the US, and is unlikely to join the US-advocated Indo-Pacific Strategy.      Moon values autonomy. Since he came into power, he has vowed to regain wartime operational control. In the negotiations about sharing the cost for US forces stationed in South Korea, the Moon administration has assumed an uncompromising stance. Therefore, the Moon administration will not make big changes in its policy toward the US.      South Korea will continue to seek a balance between China and the US. Generally speaking, since China and South Korea established diplomatic relations, the progressive parties have held a friendly attitude toward China. The THAAD issue once drove Beijing-Seoul relations into a ditch. During Moon's visit to China in 2017 after his inauguration, South Korea made a commitment to the "three nos" on the THAAD issue - there had been no request, no consultation, and no decision made by the US or South Korea. China and South Korea maintain communication and coordination on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue and steadily promote regional cooperation. The economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries damaged by the THAAD issue have been gradually restored.      Currently, economy recovery and development are the thorniest problem confronting the South Korean government. Therefore, when developing relations with China, the Moon administration's priority will be economic and trade cooperation. To maintain smooth economic cooperation, South Korea will adopt friendly and cooperative diplomacy with China. But it's worth noting that South Korea's China policy is also influenced by its relations with the US and the general situation on the peninsula.      During Moon's term in office, South Korea's tough diplomacy toward Japan will not change. Tensions between South Korea and Japan have risen from disputes over historical and territorial issues to a trade war. In regard to the history of Japanese aggression, South Korea insists on accountability. Moon has scrapped an agreement on the "comfort women" issue struck under the previous administration of Park Geun-hye, and Moon has ordered Japanese firms to compensate people who were exploited as forced labor.      In 2019, when Japan resorted to sanction means to fight back, South Korea announced the suspension of the two country's General Security of the Military Intelligence Agreement. The disputes between Seoul and Tokyo now involve both economic and military diplomacy. These disputes are unlikely to be resolved in the short term. Adhering to a tough stance toward Japan serves Moon's strategy to build consensus and shift contradictions at home.      Moon attaches great importance to economic cooperation with Russia. Therefore, he has put forward the "New Northern Policy" and the "Nine Bridges" concept of developing the Far Eastern region with Russia. At the end of 2019, the South Korean government made the implementation of the "New Northern Policy" the focus in its work plan for 2020. Thus, South Korea will continue to promote economic cooperation with Russia.      In terms of political diplomacy, South Korea and Russia's common concern mainly lies in the nuclear issue on the peninsula. As China and Russia adopt coordinated policies on this issue, South Korea will maintain diplomatic communication with Russia. Since the THAAD issue affects Russia's strategic security, the issue will influence South Korea-Russia relations.      Moon has advocated greater diversity in South Korea's diplomacy. Apart from developing relations with the above four powers, South Korea will also strive to develop its diplomacy with Southeast Asia, India and Central Asia.

“Animals can sometimes appear healthy even when they are carrying germs that can make people sick, depending on the zoonotic disease. Zoonotic diseases range from minor shot-term illness to major life-changing disease that can cause death.” The Conservator General described the incident as an imminent health danger not only to lives of important aquatics in the coastlines, but also the residents of the area. He commended the residents and some patriotic Bonny men who carried out preliminary investigations into the incident that revealed the species of the affected fish as Croaker. According to the reports, the fishes appeared to be contaminated by some sort of chemicals as some of them were swollen, excreting puss from their dead bodies, turned green and had a pungent odour, even from a distance. Goni warned that such fish should not be allowed to enter the markets of the affected communities as that will pose a serious danger to their health. “With a massive and rising death toll, and crumbling economic and education systems, the world has already taken serious hits from Covid-19. Any possible further incident must be quickly brought under control so as to nip in the bud another viral disease, this time originating from Nigeria. He, however, called for more comprehensive investigation into the incident by all relevant stakeholders to forestall the surge of yet another disease in the country. There should also be an immediate plan by experts to mop up the fishes that were reported to have entered some markets in Port Harcourt city. “The affected shores should be cleared before the bodies of the fishes become environmental disaster”. Goni said the management of animals need an integrated approach and application of veterinary science. “Animals should be handled by experts and, more importantly, this requires collaborative, cross-sectoral efforts of both human and animal health systems. This multidisciplinary approach includes considering the complexities of the ecosystems where humans and animals coexist.”

Apprehensions of people crossing illegally have declined by 77% since a peak in May, according to Customs and Border Protection. April figures have not been released yet but are expected to be even lower.
 The cameras were set up as President Donald Trump announced he would sign an executive order Wednesday placing a 60-day pause on issuing green cards in an effort to limit competition for jobs in a U.S. economy wrecked by the coronavirus.
 Trump has used emergency powers during the pandemic to implement an aggressive border crackdown that has included turning away or immediately deporting asylum-seekers, including minors. It’s unclear if the surveillance cameras and additional troops were part of that strategy.
 The addition of the mobile cameras, which are are mounted in the back of trucks, bring the total to 192, according to the documents.
 Southern border expert David Shirk sees no justification for adding cameras and troops. He pointed out that Mexico so far has a fraction of the number of COVID-19 cases that have been confirmed in the United States, while deportees flown back from the U.S. have introduced cases in their home countries.
 “There is no evidence that suggests there are hordes of COVID-19 patients lined up along the border," said Shirk, an associate political science professor at University of San Diego. “And there is no evidence that COVID-19 is even contributing to a surge in people trying to cross the border."
 The government's own numbers show the opposite. Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border have been declining for nine straight months.
 As of Sunday, the 60 added mobile surveillance cameras planned to be manned and operational, according to the documents. That day, the six Mexican states bordering the U.S. reported a total of about 125 confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to Mexico's health secretary. By comparison, the four U.S. states that border Mexico — California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas — recorded about 55,000 infections Sunday.
 Pentagon officials as recently as August were considering a request from the Department of Homeland Security to send reconnaissance planes and military drones designed for battlegrounds in Afghanistan and Iraq to the border.
 Administration officials have declined to say whether that plan, first reported by Newsweek on Aug. 9, is still in the works. In December, Richardson, the U.S. Army North commander, ordered historically unclassified documents and daily briefings on the U.S.-Mexico border to be moved to a classified system to prevent further leaks.
 With the additional troops, about 3,000 active-duty service members are on the border along with 2,500 National Guard troops. Barred from law enforcement duties, they have kept a low profile and are largely doing on-the-ground surveillance.

This message dovetails with the ambitions of the still relatively new presidents of the European Commission and the European Council.
 They believe coronavirus has made failings in the way global powers China and the US function.
 They hope that will make way for a reborn and rebooted EU to play a bigger role on the world stage - economically, in terms of a Green revolution and digitally - after the crisis is over.
 This, anyway, is the cherished dream in Brussels right now.
 All this means the details of the post-health crisis Recovery Fund are unlikely to be agreed anytime soon.
 Following their Thursday summit, EU leaders will ask the European Commission to come up with concrete proposals but insiders say the painful process of compromise over the fund and the new EU budget is only likely to happen when leaders sit together in person. And who knows when that will next be?
 In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, there were calls all over the EU to leave the bloc. This time it's different. Eurosceptic politicians haven't gone away. Plenty of voters are still critical of Brussels. But the call to leave the EU altogether has broadly fallen silent.
 EU relations are messy and further complicated by national politics but most EU leaders think the Covid-19 programmes they've got up and running together, are better than those they'd have achieved alone.

 "I think it's too soon," Trump reiterated. "And I love the people. I love those people that use all of those things, the spas and beauty parlors and barbershops and tattoo parlors. I love them.

Each litre sold of petrol includes fuel duty at 57.95p a litre - the retailers' margin - plus VAT.
 The AA reckons petrol sellers should be happy with a margin of 9p a litre, which would make the average pump price of petrol around £1 a litre when the wholesale price is 16p.
 "Instead, the average pump price is higher because retailers say they need to charge 10p a litre more to offset the lower volumes of fuel they are selling," said the AA's fuel spokesperson Luke Bosdet.
 But Mr Madderson argues that the current crisis is not a normal trading environment.
 "It's a once-in-a-lifetime trading situation where independent retailers are seeing volumes down by up to 85%," he said.
 If independent garages took a small margin, many of them would go to the wall, he warned.
 "Many [independent garages] are the only option in rural areas which means they are essential in helping to keep key workers on the road."
 He also pointed out that many are selling petrol they bought at the beginning of April, when oil was more expensive.
 ## 'Ripping off drivers'
 Campaigners warn that high taxes, which causes high-priced petrol, leads to drivers having to pay more than they should.
 "The immoral fuel supply chain has been ripping off drivers to the tune of more than £20m per day," said Howard Cox, founder of the FairFuelUK campaign.
 "Our essential workers need honestly-priced fuel, so they are not under even more financial pressure to help us all."
 Tory MP Robert Halfon said the big oil companies should do their bit to help: "They must help the government cut the cost of living and pass on quickly the fall in international oil prices to drivers.
 "When the coronavirus is over, those who profiteered unnecessarily, will face harsh consequences."

 The upcoming Labor Day holiday, which runs from May 1-5 this year, is expected to see the first holiday tourism peak in China this year in light of a much improved domestic COVID-19 situation, as the nation's major travel platform said some 90 million trips will take place, double the number during the Qingming Festival in early April.      Observers were cautiously optimistic about the tourism sector's outlook, saying a rebound will be a positive sign for victory in China's pandemic battle, but travel activity will not return to normal until the National Day holiday in October.      According to a report online travel giant Ctrip sent to the Global Times on Wednesday, as of mid-April, big data on the platform showed that people planning to travel around the May holiday hit a record high since the COVID-19 outbreak began. The expected traffic volume will increase 353 percent, and the total number of trips will rise by 282 percent, compared with the beginning of April.      China Tourism Academy data showed that more than 43 million trips were made during the three-day Qingming Festival holiday in early April, generating a revenue of 8.26 billion yuan ($1.16 billion), an 80 percent drop year-on-year. Ctrip analysis predicts that travel volume during the Labor Day holiday will be double that during the April holiday, or even more. Local group travel bookings within travelers' home provinces are up160 percent.      It is reasonable for people, having stayed home for months, to make travel plans to cheer themselves up, and the significantly reined-in epidemic situation in China offers some reassurance, Li Mingde, a senior consultant with the center of tourism studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.      But amid the pandemic and the fluctuating situation of COVID-19 in some domestic regions, some people are wary of cross-province travel, and most travelers plan to stay close to home.      Shanghai residents are most active in their plans to travel while the city is also expected to receive the most visitors. Beijing ranks seventh in terms of departures and third in terms of planned destinations, per the report. Beijing currently adopts the most stringent prevention measures with strict quarantine rules.      Li said the trend was reasonable as cross-region trips could lead to such problems as new quarantine periods.      Thailand news outlet The Thaiger reported that over half of Chinese surveyed expressed willingness to travel abroad some time in 2020, and more than 70 percent took Thailand into consideration. Thailand, which received 11 million Chinese among some 40 million foreign travelers in 2019, saw its tourism hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.      The situation may not ease so soon during the upcoming travel rush. Platforms do not have overseas itinerary booking services now, and analysts warn that even when the restriction loosens, the public should remain vigilant. Traveling abroad could be inconvenient for the traveler considering epidemic- control procedures and ruin the hard-won domestic battle against COVID-19, Li said.      China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday urged citizens to refrain from going abroad, and to fully assess the serious risks of cross-infection and being stranded overseas.      To ensure that holiday trips take place in a secure and orderly fashion, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the National Health Commission released a notice on April 13, ordering that domestic tourism spots should only open outdoor areas and keep indoor venues closed.      Visitors admitted to a spot should not surpass 30 percent of its capacity, read the notice. Scenic spots were also told to establish and improve their reservation systems and implement time-slot scheduling rules.      Luo Yameng, a Beijing-based urban management expert, told the Global Times that the tourism industry's recovery is crucial to the country's economy in the post-epidemic period, but disease prevention and control remains a priority at the moment.      Therefore, regulations must be implemented strictly and violators must be punished severely, Luo said.      Visitors should assess the risks carefully and protect themselves through such measures as wearing face masks, especially at crowded areas. Li said. They may take them off in less crowded outdoor areas, he said.      Luo and Li predicted that the National Day golden week in October should be a safe and appropriate time for the tourism sector to resume normal operations.      They pointed out that the holding of the national "two sessions" could be a major sign to declare China's total victory over the coronavirus, and before that time, travel should be carried out with caution.

During his nine seasons in New England, the Patriots won nine division titles and appeared in eight AFC championship games, advancing to five Super Bowls. In 16 career playoff games, he has 81 catches for 1,163 yards and 12 TDs.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Feminine hygiene products are essential items. They are expensive and can be difficult to obtain when experiencing homelessness, fleeing domestic violence or struggling to make ends meet. Or, during a global pandemic.

Out of fear of not knowing how long they’ll be stuck in the house, and because periods don’t stop for quarantines.      I Support the Girls Grand Rapids, MI is non-profit organization that supports every woman that needs help. They opened in March 2019, and since January they have worked with 24 organizations across West Michigan and donated nearly 83,000 products. 13 ON YOUR SIDE spoke to affiliate director Emily Beggs about helping the women not only during the time of pandemic, but always connecting organizations to donations.

As it stands right now, the Bills do not have a pick in the first round of the NFL draft. They sent it to Minnesota as part of the trade to acquire wide receiver Stefon Diggs.
 As unlikely as that seems, it could change, although that Bills general manager Brandon Beane has said he doesn't see it happening and that he views Diggs as the Bills' first-round choice this year. The Bills sent the 22nd pick in the first round to Minnesota in the trade.
 The Bills right now have the 54th pick in the draft. That's well into the second round.
 Beane has been a busy man this offseason. You could argue that on paper the Bills don't have a glaring need along the likes of the one at quarterback before they drafted Josh Allen.
 Yes, there are positions that aren't as deep as others but overall. On paper, at least, there isn't one single position that absolutely jumps out at you putting the Bills in a great spot entering the draft.
 Certainly in the short term, that appears to be the case for the Bills. But taking a longer-term view the positions the Bills seem to have a greatest needs are defensive end, cornerback and running back.

One of the first lessons in an economics class is everything has a cost. That's in stark contrast to lessons in the political arena where politicians talk about free stuff. In our personal lives, decision-making involves weighing costs against benefits. Businessmen make the same calculation if they want to stay in business. It's an entirely different story for politicians running the government where any benefit, however minuscule, is often deemed to be worth any cost, however large.
   
 Related to decision-making is the issue of being overly safe versus not safe enough. Sometimes, being as safe as one can be is worthless. A minor example: How many of us before driving our cars inspect the hydraulic brake system for damage? We'd be safer if we did, but most of us just assume everything is OK and get into our car and drive away. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 40,000 Americans lose their lives each year because of highway fatalities. Virtually all those lives could be saved with a mandated 5 mph speed limit. Fortunately, we consider costs and rightfully conclude that saving those 40,000 lives aren't worth the costs and inconvenience of a 5 mph mandate.
   
 With the costs and benefits in mind, we might examine our government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first thing to keep in mind about any crisis, be it war, natural disasters or pandemics, is we should keep markets open and private incentives strong. Markets solve problems because they provide the right incentives to use resources effectively. Federal, state and local governments have ordered an unprecedented and disastrous shutdown of much of the U.S. economy in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 There's a strictly health-related downside to the shutdown of the U.S. economy ignored by our leadership that has been argued by epidemiologist Dr. Knut Wittkowski, formerly the head of the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at Rockefeller University in New York City. Wittkowski argues that the lockdown prolongs the development of the "herd immunity," which is our only weapon in "exterminating" the novel coronavirus -- outside of a vaccine that's going to optimistically take 18 months or more to produce. He says we should focus on shielding the elderly and people with comorbidities while allowing the young and healthy to associate with one another in order to build up immunities. Wittkowski says, "So, it's very important to keep the schools open and kids mingling to spread the virus to get herd immunity as fast as possible, and then the elderly people, who should be separated, and the nursing homes should be closed during that time, can come back!
   
 and meet their children and grandchildren after about 4 weeks when the virus has been exterminated." Herd immunity, Wittkowski argues, would stop a "second wave" headed for the United States in the fall. Dr. David L. Katz, president of True Health Initiative and the founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, shares Wittkowski's vision. Writing in The New York Times, he argued that our fight against COVID-19 could be worse than the virus itself.
   
 The bottom line is that costs can be concealed but not eliminated. Moreover, if people only look at the benefits from a particular course of action, they will do just about anything, because everything has a benefit. Political hustlers and demagogues love promising benefits when the costs can easily be concealed. By the way, the best time to be wrong and persist in being wrong is when the costs of being wrong are borne by others.
   
 The absolute worst part of the COVID-19 pandemic, and possibly its most unrecoverable damage, is the massive power that Americans have given to their federal, state and local governments to regulate our lives in the name of protecting our health. Taking back that power should be the most urgent component of our recovery efforts. It's going to be challenging; once a politician, and his bureaucracy, gains power, he will fight tooth and nail to keep it.

Esri, which unlike other large conventions that rotate each year to different locations around the country, has long been an annual San Diego staple. It is estimated, in normal times, to draw 18,000 attendees who spend about $31 million while in San Diego and account for some 30,000 hotel room night bookings.
 The conference, which was to be held in mid-July over several days, was expected to generate $1 million in hotel room tax revenues. The city of San Diego already is facing a staggering loss this coming fiscal year of $300 million in tax revenue, a large share of which is from overnight hotel stays that are no longer occurring as tourism and conventions come to a standstill.
 In all, more than 40 conventions and events, large and small, were canceled or postponed for the months of March through July, reports the San Diego Convention Center Corp. Together, they account for more than 294,000 hotel room nights and lost room tax revenue of $11.4 million.
 “We are continuing to experience cancellation of some of our largest and most important conventions and meetings,” said San Diego Tourism Authority CEO Joe Terzi, whose agency oversees the booking of the larger San Diego conventions. “Back in February when we first started to hear more about Covid-19, I remember thinking that it would impact the tourism industry but that we should be back in business by summer.

Apart from Germany's Angela Merkel - who will not want the EU to fall apart in her last term in office - the big players in this debate are all vying to be re-elected. They're keen to prove their credentials to a domestic audience.
 ## Solidarity or self-interest?
 With an eye on Eurosceptic politicians at home, the Dutch prime minister wants to be seen to be protecting Dutch taxpayers' money on the European stage.
 Italy's prime minister also needs to show he's sticking up for his country in Brussels. Italy was one of the EU's most Eurosceptic nations even before the coronavirus crisis.
 And France? Emmanuel Macron is always looking over his shoulder at arch- Eurosceptic and political rival Marine Le Pen.
 He's trying to weave a delicate dance between giving the French the impression that he's leading the post-virus recovery charge in Europe, while trying to get extra cash for the countries of the Mediterranean (including France), yet trying hard not to alienate Berlin, which he hopes will foot the largest chunk of the bill.
 Quite the juggling act.
 The French (and Italian and Spanish) argument is now refocused, not on solidarity but self-interest.
 Their message to the frugal North: we all benefit from the single market. It's worth spending a bit more in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis to rebalance inequalities between members to make the market more competitive and lucrative in the long term.
 Otherwise you risk the market faltering altogether.

“We are continuing to reduce our hotel occupancy forecasts and overall visitation numbers and don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel until first quarter 2021.”
 The latest figures for San Diego County hotels show an occupancy level of just 25 percent for the week ending April 18, according to the firm STR, which tracks hotel performance. Normally, hotels this time of year would be quite busy, with occupancy rates approaching 80 percent.
 Even more startling is the number of shuttered hotels. In its analysis, STR reported an unprecedented 70 San Diego County hotel closures, representing 16,802 rooms — roughly 30 percent of the county’s 55,000 hotel rooms.
 Before deciding to call off their convention, Esri organizers sought assurances from San Diego hotels that they wouldn’t be charged cancellation fees should they have to cancel because of COVID-19. The vast majority of the hotels agreed to forego imposing the fees, Terzi said.

Local law enforcement in Story County including the sheriff's office are encouraging residents to be on the look out for potential COVID-19 related scams, officials said.
   
 Although both Story County Sheriff's Office and the Ames Police Department have not yet received a call related to COVID-19 scams, the law enforcement agencies want to be ahead of the game by informing the public on what other agencies have been witnessing, Story County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Nick Lennie said.
   
 "We wanted to be on the front end of of a possible uptick in these types of scams, so we wanted to start educating the public [by] giving them warning of what to look for," Lennie said.
   
 The Iowa's Attorney General office first sent out a notice on March 10 asking Iowans to be on the look out for price gauging and COVID-19 related scams.
   
 As of Tuesday, there have been minimal reports of scams related to COVID-19 to the Story County Sheriff's Office, Lennie said.
   
 In Ames, the police department has had no reports about scams related to COVID-19 Ames Police Cmdr. Jason Tuttle said.
   
 Both Departments are still, however, receiving consistent reports about scams not related to COVID-19, officials said.
   
 The Story County Sheriff's Office is asking residents to be aware of following criteria in detecting a COVID-19 related scam:Government officials will not ask for your personal information. Ignore solicitations for personal or financial information via phone, email, or text.Do not trust the call ID number; with current technology, it is common for a scammer to make it appear the call is from a legitimate number.Do not fall prey to fake cures and treatments for COVID-19, as these can be extremely harmful to your health. Only accept medical treatment or virus testing from your doctor, pharmacist, or local health department.Be cautious with work-from-home schemes. Many fraudulent work-from-home scams will require you to pay them first in return for a job. Legitimate jobs will not ask you to pay them.Scammers will often post as someone you would trust, such as a family member, bank, or law enforcement official. Be suspicious of any calls received asking for money or personal informationScammers will pressure you to make decisions in a hurry and might even threaten you. Slow down, call someone you trust, and verify the information before proceeding.
   
 Local law enforcement agencies are worried now that the economic stimulus checks of $1,200 have been issued to some, and believe it will cause an increase in the amount of scams reported.
   
 Law enforcement officials want residents that the IRS will not refer to the check as a, "stimulus check" and will never contact someone by phone.
   
 "If there's any communication from the IRS about the economic impact statement or payment. It's going to be worded that way. They're not going to use the word stimulus check or stimulus pay payment," Lennie said. "Those are a couple red flag words if [someone is] getting an email with those describing it as stimulus check or stimulus payment, it's not from the IRS."
   
 If you have been a received a call you believe to be a scam or have become a victim law enforcement encourages you to report it immediately, Lennie said.
