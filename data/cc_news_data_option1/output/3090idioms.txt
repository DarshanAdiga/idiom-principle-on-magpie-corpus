Iraq announced Thursday it will create an inventory of all hazardous materials at ports and airports after the ignition of ammonium nitrate fertiliser at a portside warehouse levelled swathes of Beirut.An emergency committee chaired by the head of Iraq's border agency said it had been tasked with carrying out the work and had given itself 72 hours to complete it. The goal was to "avoid any repetition of what happened in Lebanon" in Iraq, the panel said.The huge blast that caused widespread destruction across the Lebanese capital on Tuesday was triggered by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser that had been stored in the city's port for years.A security official said on condition of anonymity the ammonium nitrate had arrived in Lebanon in 2013 on board a Moldovan-flagged ship sailing from Georgia and bound for Mozambique.Port authorities unloaded the ammonium nitrate and stored it in a rundown warehouse with cracks in its walls, several security officials said.Security forces launched an investigation in 2019 after the warehouse reportedly started to exude a strange odour, and concluded that the "dangerous" chemicals should be removed, but no action was taken.The revelations have sparked fury in Lebanon that so much ammonium nitrate could be stored for so long in the heart of the capital.The standing of Lebanon's political class was already close to rock bottom after months of mass protests against mismanagement of the deeply indebted economy, before social distancing related to the coronavirus pandemic brought some breathing space for the establishment.Iraq too has seen mass protests over the past year against a political system based on confessional quotas that is seen as corrupt and incompetent.The searing summer heat in Iraq makes it even more vulnerable to the danger of accidental explosions of poorly stored hazardous materials.The accidental ignition of munitions stocked in residential areas has caused deadly explosions in Iraq in the past, although such incidents have largely been put down to the costs of war.

In this case, though, that need not have been the case, with City seemingly spending more than required.
 The reality at Anfield is somewhat different this summer, with transfers on the backfoot thanks to financial uncertainty.
 In a recent Q&A session on the Liverpool ECHO website, Paul Gorst wrote: "The reasons why have been extensively explained. Signing a £50 million player weeks after attempting to furlough staff would have been a disaster of a PR move, too.
 "FSG and Liverpool are waiting to see how things develop over next few months, finance-wise. The club had their revenue streams cut off for three months with one of the biggest wage bills in the sport."
 A deal for Norwich City's Jamal Lewis is on the cards but Liverpool and the Canaries are some way off in their valuations of the player at this stage.

PARIS - The government of Lebanon has given an "investigative committee" four days to determine responsibility for the devastating explosion in Beirut port on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Charbel Wehbe told French radio Thursday.
 "This morning, a decision was taken to create an investigative committee which in four days maximum must provide a detailed report on responsibility -- how, who, what, where? There will be judicial decisions," he told Europe 1 radio.
 "It is serious, and we take it seriously," Wehbe said.
 "Those responsible for this horrible crime of negligence will be punished by a committee of judges," he added.
 The provisional death toll from the massive blast stood at 137 Thursday, but with dozens missing and 5,000 wounded, the number of victims was expected to rise as rescue workers continued to comb through the rubble.
 The Beirut governor estimated up to 300,000 people may have been made temporarily homeless by the disaster, which he said would cost the debt-ridden country in excess of $3 billion.
 On Wednesday, the government called for the house arrest of those responsible for the storage of a large quantity of ammonium nitrate, a substance used in fertilisers and explosives, in the port of the Lebanese capital.
 According to Lebanese officials, the explosion was caused by a fire igniting 2,750 tonnes of the substance in a portside warehouse.
 "It is an accident... preliminary reports indicate it is mismanagement of explosive products. This is a very serious neglect that continued for six years,' said Wehbe.
 Prime Minister Hassan Diab and President Michel Aoun have promised to put the culprits behind bars, but trust in institutions is low and few on the streets of the Lebanese capital hold out hope of an impartial inquiry.
 Human Rights Watch on Thursday supported mounting calls for an international probe as the only credible option.
 "An independent investigation with international experts is the best guarantee that victims of the explosion will get the justice they deserve," the watchdog said.
 In France, prosecutors on Wednesday opened a probe into the blast over injuries inflicted on 24 French citizens.
 Flights carrying medical aid, field hospitals, rescue experts and tracking dogs have been flying into Beirut airport since Wednesday.
 And French President Emmanuel Macron was expected in Lebanon later Thursday, the highest-ranking foreign leader to visit since the tragedy.
 Macron was due to meet Aoun and other political leaders as well as civil society representatives.

  The central bank has also decided to put in place an incentive framework for banks in order to address the regional disparities in the flow of priority sector credit. Under the revised PSL norms, the RBI has also increased the targets for lending to 'Small and Marginal Farmers' and 'Weaker Sections'.

FABIEN RIGGALL: I think the future of film, music, art, and TV are all coming together as one. Secret Cinema reimagined the way people watch movies, my vision is about how we can now do that with distribution and original productions. I want this to venture back to a time when independent movies were really provocative, challenging. That’s not to say there aren’t amazing films coming out today but my feeling is that the current system is not rewarding filmmakers, musicians, artists and audiences. Before COVID hit, there were already so many beautiful movies not getting audiences. People are looking for changes in the way work is created and released.

Hahn deliberately kept modern faces out of the film — we only hear the voices of Ashman's mother and sister, his partner Bill Lauch and his contemporaries at Disney and in the New York theater world — because he wanted it to feel like a VHS-era time machine. He also wanted to let Ashman tell his own story, so he strung together every available recorded interview, along with songwriting work session tapes, to give it a "fly-on-the-wall style that made you feel like you were there just talking to him."
 The documentary also reveals Ashman's sometimes tetchy personality.
 "He was difficult in the ways that he _had_ to be difficult, in order to have the work be what it became. And I bless him for that," says Menken. "It was authentic and important. There wasn't a cruel bone in Howard's body. He didn't suffer fools easily, and you see some of that in the way he would create his villains and how we would treat them — like the dentist [from _Little Shop_ ], or Gaston — because they were always kind of idiots [ _laughs_ ]. And what was funny about them is the way, as a writer, he would beat them up."
 Ashman was courted by Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg to come to the company at a time when its animation department was on the skids.
 "The animation studio was basically shutting down," Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in _The Little Mermaid_ , recalled in 2016. "When we did our film, we didn't even have an animation division over at the lot; they'd been kicked off and in these little cubicles in this run-down place. Going in there and seeing all these animators crammed into these little cubicles and sleeping on the floor, it was just unbelievable to think that Walt's vision was dying."
 Hahn chronicled that era in his 2009 documentary, _Waking Sleeping Beauty_. But his new film, _Howard_ , is a sister documentary that shines a concentrated spotlight on Ashman's influence.

Hyun-Jin Ryu combined with four relievers on a three-hitter and the Toronto Blue Jays beat Sean Newcomb and the shorthanded Atlanta Braves 2-1. Ryu lasted only five innings but was dominant as he gave up only one hit, an infield single by Adam Duvall in the second inning. Duvall homered in the seventh off Thomas Hatch. Ryu struck out eight. The Braves were forced to recast their lineup after placing Ozzie Albies and Matt Adams on the injured list and giving Freddie Freeman a day off. The new-look lineup didn’t resemble the unit which had 13 hits in a 10-1 win over the Blue Jays on Tuesday night.
