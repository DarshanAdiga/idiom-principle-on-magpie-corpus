Paramount Drive-In Theatres was originally known as the Roadium (see #2 below) when it opened in 1947 ‚Äî but was rechristened in 1948 after the City of Paramount (not Paramount Pictures). Built upon an old cornfield, the drive-in was surrounded by dairy farms and chicken coops until the 1970s, when it expanded into a two-screener. At least since its grand reopening six years ago, one screen has been devoted to family-friendly programming (with each main attraction showing twice for an early and late screening).

What I like about this feature is they talk more about Bill and Ted's daughters, giving us a look into their knowledge of music. My whole theory about _Bill & Ted Face the Music _is that, as stated in the trailer, the world needs a song by "Preston and Logan." No one said _which_ Preston and Logan write the song, just that it comes from those names. So ‚Ä¶ it could be that their daughters write the song that unites the world, and Bill and Ted perform it.

There was so much whisky on board that--following an initial rush among locals to rescue what they could from the foundering ship--freeloaders would still be recovering bottles nearly half a century later, even after the ship's hull was blown up and sunk to discourage more salvage (that is, looting). Some washed up on local beaches, and others were brought up by divers. One of the latter, found by professional diver George Currie in 1987, is now up for sale at Scotland's Grand Whisky Auction, where bidding will close on August 10, 2020. At press time, the bottle was already going for nearly $8,000. Though the auction house warns unequivocally that the "bottle is not suitable for human consumption," the winning bidder will also be treated to a diving helmet and bricks from the ship itself.

Silver also reported that Clowney continues to want a deal around $15 million or $16 million a year and possibly more, saying he turned down an offer for that amount early in free agency.
 Reports have said Seattle's first offer was in the range of $15 million to $16 million, but after the Seahawks had to fill other needs they told Clowney they could no longer keep that offer on the table. Any current Seattle offer isn't believed to be in that range.
 Clowney had at one point been reported as willing to lower his demands. But recent indications is that he is not offering Seattle any discount, and as Silver reported "continues to seek a deal that he believes reflects his value."

ATLANTA (AP) ‚Äî Democrats are asking a federal judge to order Georgia election officials to take steps to prevent long lines at the polls on Election Day.
 A lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Atlanta alleges that the causes of long lines that have forced Georgians to wait hours to vote during multiple elections, including the June primary, ‚Äúare directly traceable‚Äù to election officials. The lawsuit seeks "to remedy the fundamentally unreasonable conditions that have led, repeatedly, to unconstitutional burdens on countless Georgia voters."
 The lawsuit was filed by the Democratic Party of Georgia, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and three Georgia voters against Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who's the top elections official in the state, and other state and county election officials.
 Raffensperger's office did not immediately have a comment on the lawsuit Thursday.
 ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, what matters to us is that voters are not negatively impacted at any level of the electoral process," state Sen. Nikema Williams, chair of the state Democratic Party, told reporters Thursday.
 The long lines are caused by the closure and consolidation of polling places, a failure to provide adequate equipment, insufficient training of election officials and volunteers, a shortage of technicians to address technical problems, insufficient time to set up polling locations and a lack of emergency paper ballot backups when equipment fails, the lawsuit says.
 It asks a judge to declare that these problems violate voters' constitutional rights and to order election officials to provide enough polling places and other election resources to prevent long lines on Election Day.

Slip of the tongue after play-off final success


--DocBreak--
Now that the COVID-delayed deadline to withdraw from the NBA Draft has passed, there is at least some clarity on where each Southeastern Conference men's basketball sprogram stands heading into the 2020-21 season.
   
 Missouri, which retains Jeremiah Tilmon, Xavier Pinson and Mitchell Smith, brings back one of the most experienced groups at the power-conference level.
   
 The Tigers are far from the only team to benefit from the offseason, as 17 of the 33 SEC players to declare for the draft decided to return to school. Tennessee and LSU kept players such as Yves Pons and Ja'Vonte Smart, respectively, which combined with those programs' strong recruiting classes makes them look like league favorites.
   
 Missouri appears to be a sleeper choice to ascend the SEC standings, with a wealth of experience and a deep rotation of players.
   
 Arkansas and Alabama had better-than-expected results from the NBA Draft window, with Isaiah Joe and John Petty coming back to Fayetteville and Tuscaloosa, respectively. Yet there were still changes on the rosters in place around them.
   
 Other teams weren't facing the same uncertainty when it came to draft decisions.
   
 Mississippi (no players declared), Texas A&M; (no players declared), Florida (knew Kerry Blackshear was leaving after one season), Georgia (knew Anthony Edwards was leaving after one season) and South Carolina (A.J. Lawson was the Gamecocks' lone player in the draft process and he returned) all fall into this category.
   
 Four SEC teams lost traction from the NBA Draft process and the offseason overall.
   
 The easiest case to explain is Auburn, which will have its first-ever lottery pick in Isaac Okoro stay in the NBA pool. Auburn also lost a talented senior class that represented the core of its 2019 Final Four team.
   
 Being in a "revamping" spot is par for the course for John Calipari-coached Kentucky teams. Five Wildcats who chipped in significant minutes entered and have stayed in the draft. That's to go along with the few others who graduated or transferred because of lack of playing time, including Khalil Whitney and Johnny Juzang.
   
 However, Kentucky brings to Lexington the nation's No. 1 recruiting class, with six four- or five-star recruits, including St. Louis native Cam'Ron Fletcher.
   
 Vanderbilt was at the bottom of the league last season, and after losing both Saben Lee and Aaron Nesmith to the draft, coach Jerry Stackhouse's second season in Nashville could be troublesome.
   
 The team hit hardest by the NBA draft process was Mississippi State, which was a bubble team at the end of the 2019-20 season. The Bulldogs had five players test the draft waters, and perhaps the most talented trio of the bunch all left Starkville in Reggie Perry, Nick Weatherspoon and Robert Woodard II.
   
 Returning to Mizzou
   
 Missouri returns players who make up 87.7% of the team's minutes played last season.
   
 In coach Cuonzo Martin's other three seasons at the helm of Missouri, MU had 63.9% of minutes return for 2019-20, 39.2% entering 2018-19, and in Martin's first season, the only campaign he's led the Tigers to the NCAA Tournament while in Columbia thus far, he started with 67.5% of the previous year's minutes played returning to the team.
   
 The return of Pinson, Tilmon and Smith to Missouri brings back perhaps its best frontcourt (Pinson) and backcourt (Tilmon) players alongside arguably its most improved player (Smith) from last year.
   
 Pinson played in all 31 games as a sophomore with 11 starts, averaging 11.1 points per game while shooting 40% from the field.
   
 The Chicago native proved to be the Tigers' most dynamic player down the stretch of the season, scoring 18.9 points per game over the final nine contests, including four 20-point games. Pinson scored in double digits 14 times, with nine of those coming in SEC play.
   
 Smith enters his fifth season at MU as a redshirt senior coming off his most productive campaign in Columbia.
   
 The 6-foot-10 forward set career-high season totals with 153 points, 146 rebounds and 20 assists last winter. He stretched the floor with 20 3-pointers and shot 85.4% from the free-throw line.
   
 "Mitch is one of those guys, he might leave the game with seven points, but there was a big steal, a big charge, a big block, a big 3. There are so many ways to impact the game," Martin said. "And for us as a staff, the biggest key with Mitch is to keep his confidence at a high level, and it's not as if he walks with his head down, but just to maintain his level of confidence.
   
 "Because when his confidence is high, he brings so much to the table."
   
 Tilmon has 81 career games under his belt as he enters his final season at MU.
   
 The gifted 6-foot-10 center has averaged 8.9 points and 4.9 rebounds over his career, shooting 56% from the field, which is tied for fourth all-time in program history. Tilmon has 79 career blocked shots after swatting 21 shots as a junior.
   
 Last season, he was hampered by a foot injury but averaged 8.2 points per game while shooting 58.9% from the field in 17 games.
   
 Missouri also returns experienced players such as Dru Smith, Mark Smith, Kobe Brown, Javon Pickett and Torrence Watson to Columbia next season.

After the notes showed up in Liverpool, London, and even the United States (among other places), the government announced in 1958 that 211,267 of them had been accounted for. That leaves tens of thousands that, for all we know, are still just drifting about.

As policy planning chief, Hook tried to strengthen the Iran deal, which Trump denounced during the 2016 presidential campaign as the worst deal ever negotiated and pledged to pull out from. Central to his efforts was trying to persuade the European participants in the accord ‚Äî Britain, France and Germany ‚Äî to impose tougher restrictions on Iranian missile activity. Those efforts failed.
 Once Tillerson was fired and Pompeo took over with a presidential mandate to withdraw from the deal and Trump pulled out of the agreement, Hook's focus shifted to reimposing U.S. sanctions on Iran.
 Since withdrawing, the U.S. has steadily ratcheted up pressure on Iran by imposing penalties on countries importing Iranian oil, declaring its Revolutionary Guard a "foreign terrorist organization" and killing a commander of the paramilitary organization this year in a missile strike in Iraq.
 Under the deal orchestrated largely by the Obama administration, Iran was granted billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program that the U.S. and others alleged was a cover for atomic weapons development. Once he became Iran envoy, Hook was in charge of identifying sanctions to be restored and lobbying Europeans and others to follow suit. Few have.
 At the same time, Hook had some success in negotiating prisoner swaps with Iran, securing the release of two Americans in exchange for Iranians held in the United States. Hook twice flew to Zurich, Switzerland, to take custody of freed Americans.
 Hook will be replaced after an as-yet undetermined transition period by Abrams, who will continue in his job as Venezuela envoy, Pompeo said. Abrams has led the administration‚Äôs push to try to force Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power by backing his main rival Juan Guaido. It's an unfinished effort that Abrams will continue while serving as Iran envoy.
 Abrams is perhaps best known for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration in which weapons were sold to Iran to support anti- communist rebels in Nicaragua. Abrams, then a National Security Council aide, was convicted of withholding information from Congress about the matter, but was pardoned by President George H.W. Bush.
 Hook had given few people inside the administration advance notice that he intended to leave and on Wednesday had appeared at a session on Iran at the Aspen Security Forum. He had just returned to the U.S. from an extended trip to Middle East and Europe during which he tried to drum up support for the Iran arms embargo extension.

"It's hard not to connect those dots," Silver said.
 The Seahawks have an open spot on their 80-man roster, assuming that the expected re-signing of defensive end Branden Jackson is completed soon.
 Griffen or Matthews would each likely sign a one-year deal, likely including incentives for games played.
 As for Clowney, Silver's report is the latest indication that he may have turned out to be a one-year wonder with the Seahawks after arriving amid much fanfare the week the regular season began a year ago.
 The Seahawks got Clowney from Houston for linebackers Jacob Martin and Barkevious Mingo and a third-round draft pick, which Houston then traded to the Raiders for cornerback Garreon Conley. The pick, No. 91 overall, ended up being used by the Patriots to take tight end Devin Asiasi of UCLA.
 One assumption all along had been that it the Seahawks didn't re-sign Clowney they would at least get a compensatory pick for him signing elsewhere. But that deadline has long since passed.

Silver also reported that Seattle is turning its attention to free agents Everson Griffen and Clay Matthews and that a deal with one of those two "could happen soon."
 Griffen and Matthews played at USC for current Seahawks coach Pete Carroll.
 If one or the other signs soon, that would essentially mark the end of any chance of Clowney returning, as the Seahawks wouldn't have the ability to sign one of those two and Clowney.
 Griffen, 32, has played his 10-year NFL career with the Vikings and had eight sacks last season.
 Matthews, 34, played 10 seasons for Green Bay and spent last year with the Rams, making eight sacks in 13 games.
 In an interview on 710 ESPN Seattle on Thursday morning, Silver said he's not sure Clowney will be signing with any team soon, noting that the market has changed as the COVID-19 pandemic has continued.
