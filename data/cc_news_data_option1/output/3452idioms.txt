Repost @unicef ・・・ Welcome to the world, Daisy Dove Bloom! We are honoured to introduce Goodwill Ambassadors @KatyPerry and @OrlandoBloom’s new bundle of joy.⠀ ⠀ “We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,” Katy and Orlando told us.⠀ ⠀ “But we know we’re the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was. Communities around the world are still experiencing a shortage of healthcare workers and every eleven seconds a pregnant woman or newborn dies, mostly from preventable causes. Since COVID-19 many more newborn lives are at risk because of the increased lack of access to water, soap, vaccines and medicines that prevent diseases. As parents to a newborn, this breaks our hearts, as we empathize with struggling parents now more than ever.⠀ ⠀ “As UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors, we know UNICEF is there, on the ground, doing whatever it takes to make sure every expecting mother has access to a trained health worker and access to quality healthcare. In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB’s arrival. By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimagining a healthier world for every child. We hope your ♥️ can bloom with generosity.⠀ ⠀ Gratefully-⠀ ⠀ Katy & Orlando.”⠀ ⠀ Please tap the link in our bio to support the most precious gift: a healthy child.

"I was quite surprised that a child at age eight could recognize that there was an issue there, and that he could find a solution to fix that problem. It made me very proud to see him doing this."
 The observation sparked the start of Brady's K9 Fund, a non-profit that raises money to supply bullet proof vets to police and military dogs. He created a GoFundMe page, which allowed him to buy the first four vests.
 Now, so far, Brady has supplied over 257 dogs with vests and has raised over $315,000. He has supplied vests for dogs in 23 states and in Canada. He's also supplied vests for military dogs in Afghanistan.
 Tornabene said that most people don't realize that the police forces that have K9 units have to rely on the help of donations, so every dollar matters. The handlers reach out to Brady by word of mouth or via his website.

Three vaccines are now in Phase 3 trials in the United States -- drugmaker AstraZeneca's started Monday -- but a vaccine probably won't be publicly available until at least early 2021, health officials have said.
 But the Food and Drug Administration could consider authorization for a Covid-19 vaccine before Phase 3 trials are over, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn told the Financial Times. CNN has reached out to the FDA for comment.
 Still, health officials face a steep challenge with public trust and getting enough people to get a vaccine to really drive down the pandemic.
 A CNN poll this month indicated 40% of Americans wouldn't get a Covid-19 vaccine, even if it's free and easy to access.
 Part of the problem is public skepticism of the FDA after the agency's premature authorization of hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma therapy, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital.
 Both hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma therapy have been touted by President Donald Trump, who appointed the FDA commissioner.
 "The problem is both with hydroxychloroquine and with the convalescent plasma, we saw a real politicization of that scientific debate in a way that I think has all of us concerned," Jha said.
 "So what I'd like is for the science to drive this decision, for it to be very transparent, and for political leaders to not get involved in deciding when a medicine or a vaccine is safe or not."
 To increase public trust, several prominent physicians and experts have called for the creation of an independent commission separate from the FDA to review the data from Covid-19 vaccine trials.
 "I'm hearing this from my peers, from doctors and nurses. They're not anti- vaxxers. They're pro vaccine. They vaccinated their own children. But they are skeptical about this vaccine," said Dr. Kathryn Stephenson, director of the clinical trials unit at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
 But Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the US Department of Health and Human Services, said any eventual approval of a Covid-19 vaccine would be the same as for any vaccine.
 "There is a thing called a Data Safety Monitoring Board, an independent body that is assigned to each clinical trial," Mango said.
 "We have no insight into the data until the DSMB says we can look at it. They can come back and say, 'This is not a good vaccine.' They could come back before we even have 30,000 folks enrolled and say 'We have enough. This looks great.'"
 World Health Organization officials on Monday cautioned that emergency use authorization of vaccines should not be taken lightly by regulators like the FDA.
 "The emergency use authorization or licensing is something that has to be done with a great deal of seriousness and reflection. It's not something that you do very lightly," WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said during a news briefing.
 CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, Jamie Gumbrecht, Naomi Thomas, Natasha Chen, Melissa Alonso and Maggie Fox contributed to this report.

Falwell Jr. acknowledged the affair in a statement, but said he was "not involved."
 It was the latest in a string of controversies surrounding him.
 Earlier this month, the university announced Falwell Jr. was taking an indefinite leave of absence from his positions.
 That was after Falwell Jr. came under fire for posting a picture on Instagram showing him with his pants unzipped and his midsection visible to the camera. In the photo, Falwell is seen holding a cup of dark liquid with one arm around a woman whose shorts are also unzipped.
 In a radio interview with WLNI, Falwell explained that the woman was his wife's assistant. They were at a costume party and "it was just in good fun," he added.

Rosenberg cited this as a danger to animals and to anyone eating them, as well as a threat to human beings as the diseases found in the barn have the potential to spread to humans.
