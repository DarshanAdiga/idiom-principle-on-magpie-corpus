"There's no doubt the missing gallery is going to be the biggest difference," Adam Scott said. "The things that will be the same is it still means the same to us all, and maybe even more so because we return to Augusta National every year. Everything that the club does to make this a special event for everybody who gets to watch it -- whether that's on TV, the patrons who comes to the grounds or the players -- it's an incredible experience.
 "So we'll be missing one element. But it's a huge element to the experience of playing the Masters."
 Late in the afternoon, three women were strolling along toward the edge of Amen Corner with a drink called "Azalea" and not a care in the world. Their husbands were in the field, but they weren't sure if they were playing at the moment. It was a nice day. It was easy to get around. It was peaceful.
 This is the Augusta National hardly anyone gets to see.
 And it won't change much over the next six days, except for the forecast. Rain was expected at least for the next two practice rounds, and possibly throughout the week.
 The course already is softer than it usually is in April because the rye grass planted over the dead Bermuda has only had a month or so to take root. It's still pristine, and it will look that way on TV. Even so, the weather has been so warm that splotches of Bermuda grass are evident on the slopes and collection areas off the greens.
 That will have a small effect on chipping.
 "I'm anxious to see over the next couple of days how tight some of the run-off areas get because the grass has been a little thicker and longer than we see in April," Spieth said.
 He played the front nine on Monday, and when he finished his round with former champion Zach Johnson and newcomer J.T. Poston, he noticed a huge difference in how the ball responds if it comes up short.
 "Sometimes it rolls back 20, 25 yards short of the green," Spieth said. "Right now, it's only going to go 5 or 10, making the next shot a bit easier. It will be interesting to see how that changes because that changed a lot from this weekend to today."
 Spieth was around on the weekend after missing the cut in the Houston Open. Ditto for players like Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood. No one likes a weekend off. When it means going to Augusta National to get ready for the Masters -- April, November, doesn't matter -- it takes the sting off.
 Even in practice, Westwood is used to seeing a wall of people down the right side of the 11th fairway, jammed in behind the 12th tee, and then up the right side of the 13th fairway.
 On this day, it was a walk in the park. Or it felt like one, anyway.
 "It takes some getting used to," Westwood said.
 What hasn't changed is the objective.
 "We're playing the same golf course and trying to shoot the low score and beat the same players that we have to try and do every single year," Spieth said.

FanFight were pretty aggressive with their marketing strategies for the mega event. The brand is well-known already, but the marketing ploys implied for the season only enhanced its popularity. "We always approach every Indian T20 League season bearing in mind, branding and performance. As far as branding is concerned, we'll be visible Digitally and on TV. Enhance our visibility to more masses through those sectors. Depending on the performances we'll also be looking at sponsorships for the future tournaments" - said Nishanth Amerneni, Marketing Head, FanFight, before the tournament began. The brand was visible on OTT platforms like Hotstar and also on the Star Sports Network.

By ROXANA HEGEMAN   Associated Press
 WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - A California man has asked for 20 years in prison as his punishment for making a hoax call that led police to fatally shoot a Kansas man following a dispute between two online gamers over $1.50 bet in a Call of Duty WWII video game.
 Tyler R. Barriss, 26, faces sentencing Friday in federal court in Wichita for making the false report resulting in a death. His attorney argued in a sentencing memorandum that Barriss never intended for anyone to get hurt and his conduct was an outgrowth of the culture within the gaming community.
 As part of the plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Barriss pleaded guilty in November to a total of 51 federal charges that included some initially filed in California and the District of Columbia related to other fake calls and threats. He seeks the shortest term allowed in that plea deal which calls for 20 to 25 years in federal prison.
 Defense attorney Rich Federico portrayed his client as sincerely remorseful for calling Wichita police from Los Angeles on Dec. 28, 2017, to falsely report a shooting and kidnapping at a Wichita address. A police officer responding to the call fatally shot Andrew Finch, 28, after he opened the door. Finch, who was not playing video games, lived at the gamer's old address.
 In a letter to the Finch family, Barriss wrote that he thinks every day about how his actions led to his death. He asked for forgiveness and expressed his "hope that my sentence may in some way help you feel better that justice is done," according to the filing.
 Swatting is a form of retaliation sometimes used by gamers, who call police and make a false report to send first responders to an online opponent's address.
 Barriss' defense attorney argued that the notoriety of being a known swatter within the gaming community "became an intoxicant" to him and incrementally desensitized him to real world consequences. As a young man, he spent almost all of his time indoors playing video games. His only family was his grandmother. He was homeschooled until he quit school altogether. Barriss has never had a job. At the time of his arrest he was living in a homeless shelter in Los Angeles.
 "With no guidance, no structure, school, or employment, Mr. Barriss had video games," Federico wrote. "The game Halo became his salve to social acceptance in a virtual world."
 It is unclear what will become of separate Kansas charges. Barriss is scheduled for a March 4 trial in Sedgwick County District Court on state charges of involuntary manslaughter , giving a false alarm and interference with a law enforcement officer.
 Also charged as co-conspirators in the federal case in Kansas in connection to the deadly swatting call are online gamers Casey Viner, 18, of North College Hill, Ohio, and Shane Gaskill, 20, of Wichita. They have pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to obstruct justice, wire fraud and other counts. Their trial is scheduled for March 19 in U.S. District Court in Wichita.

Under such circumstances, the mainstream media acquires significant power as journalism is the designated propaganda wing for activists. Journalism that does not toe the line of liberal activists is not even considered journalism. For instance, the state-sanctioned persecution of Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami is being justified by claiming that he is not a real journalist. Unfortunately, unelected bodies rely greatly on mainstream media to decide on matters of policy, and hence, liberals continue to secure political victories without possessing the mandate from the citizenry.

Barcelona are scheduled to hold elections in the next few months to find Bartomeu's successor. The new club hierarchy's first task would be to convince Messi about the sporting project at the club.
 The Marca report also states that Messi is keen to understand what happens to the sporting director's position at Barcelona, before deciding what his future holds.
 Messi did not start at the weekend for Barcelona, in their 5-2 home win against Real Betis. However, after he came on as a half-time substitute when the score was 1-1, he inspired a sensational second half performance from Koeman's team.
 Messi set up Antoine Griezmann with a superb dummy, before scoring twice himself to eventually lead Barcelona to a comfortable win.
 That was Barcelona's first La Liga win in five games, and eased some pressure on Koeman, who had already come under fire for some of the Blaugrana's early- season performances.
 Messi is now away on international duty with Argentina, and will return to a mammoth La Liga clash after the international break. They travel to the Wanda Metropolitano to face Atletico Madrid on November 22.

It is well-established, however, that "documents attached to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are central to his claim. Such documents may be considered by a district court in ruling on the motion to dismiss."

The answer to the second part of the question is that it is. As to the question of 'why', it is simply because in the Indian system of governance, more politics is played over crucial matters by unelected bodies than by politicians themselves.

Miller went on Instagram Live on the eve of the election to tell Sen. Cory Booker (D.-New Jersey) that he decided to cast his ballot after a heart-to- heart conversation with Broncos running backs coach Curtis Modkins.
 “I just wanted to let my voice be heard,” Miller told Booker. “We’ve been fighting for the right to vote for years and years and one of my coaches, Coach Modkins, he sat down with us and we had a team meeting and we talked about how important it is to vote no matter who is on the ballot.
 “Our people have been fighting for years and years and years for this right. And, we owe it to them to go out there and vote. That really just struck me and that was really the wave that pushed me over the top to go out there and exercise my voice.”
 The NFL and its players union announced last week that following their joint efforts through NFL Votes and #AthleteAndVoter nonpartisan initiatives, 90% of active players were registered to vote in this year’s election and half the league’s stadiums were used as early voting or Election Day polling sites.
 Among the other notable calls of Week 9 were a ruling by the officials that helped turn the tide in the Baltimore Ravens’ 24-10 win at Indianapolis and NFL receiver-turned-broadcaster Brandon Stokley calling out several Denver Broncos players for complaining about getting booed at home a week earlier.
 CURIOUS CALL
 With the Colts clinging to a 10-7 lead early in the third quarter, Philip Rivers’ deep pass to Marcus Johnson was broken up by cornerback Marcus Peters. Only, the officials ruled Peters made an interception at midfield before fumbling the ball, which safety Chuck Clark smothered at the Baltimore 46.
 Ten plays later, the Ravens went ahead for good when running back Gus Edwards took it in from the 1 to put them up 14-10.
 Rivers was still miffed after the game at how the replay officials could have ruled it an interception and fumble instead of a simple pass breakup.
 “It’s gotten so jacked up how the catch rule is,” Rivers said. “I mean, nobody that’s played any amount of football or that’s been around the game ... thought that was a catch — including the guy that dropped it. But you can slow it down to milliseconds and you just make it a technicality.”
