Imogene Lewis Calhoun Las Cruces - May 19, 1924 - April 4, 2020 Imogene was born in the small town of La Mesa, New Mexico, south of Las Cruces. Her parents, John and Bertha Lewis were farmers there. She was the youngest of 7 children. She attended grade school in La Mesa and would occasionally ride her horse to school about 3 miles away. She attended Gadsden High School near Anthony, New Mexico. She was a cheerleader at Gadsden and at one of the games she met a good looking cowboy by name of Elliott Calhoun. She reminisced, when they were dating, she climbed the windmill at the Lewis farm to watch Elliott's tail lights fade out of sight as he would return home to Las Cruces. They were married on May 8, of 1942 in Tularosa, New Mexico but didn't their parents until Mother's Day. She had an adventurous life. As World War II broke out, she and Elliott moved to Roswell, NM and then Douglas, AZ, and when Elliott joined the Marines she moved home to La Mesa. While there, in 1944 their first child, Ellaine was born. After the war Elliott returned to Las Cruces and began farming and rodeoing as a Professional Cowboy. Their second child Tommy was born in 1946. Imogene loved the travel to places all over the western states as Elliott traveled the rodeo circuit. In 1958 Imogene and Elliott moved to Grants, NM where Elliott worked in construction. In 1965 Imogene joined Elliott in Alaska. They settled after a few years in the town of Valdez. She loved living in Valdez. She could overlook the Bay and see the wildlife from the window of her apartment. She owned and managed the Calhoun Court Apartments in Valdez until she moved to Peoria Arizona in 1999. At the time of her death she was living in Sierra Winds Retirement Community Nursing Care Center. She was a loving mother, and an adoring Grandmother. She was a pillar of strength throughout her life, such a great example for such a little lady. She is survived by her daughter Ellaine Doak and her husband Alan, her son Tommy Calhoun and his wife LeeAnn, Grandchildren Richard and James Doak and Kristin and Jamie Calhoun and their spouses; 10 great grandchildren; several nieces and nephews; and by her Brother-In-law and Sister-In-law Denny and Geraldine Calhoun. She will be interred next to Elliott at the Fairacers, Cemetery in Las Cruces, NM.

BERLIN (AP) — A German court on Tuesday proposed ending a criminal trial resulting from a fatal mass panic at the 2010 Love Parade techno music festival, citing questions over when the proceedings could resume in light of the coronavirus pandemic. German news agency dpa reported that the Duisburg state court suggested closing the trial in which three of the original 10 defendants face charges that include involuntary manslaughter and bodily harm. They were accused of planning failures and not monitoring security properly at the event where 21 people died. The court gave the parties in the case until April 20 to respond to the proposal. If they accept it, the trial would end without a verdict, and the statute of limitations on the charges expires in July. The trial opened in 2017 in Duisburg, a city in western Germany where the festival took place. Prosecutors last year dropped their case against seven of the defendants; the three still on trial worked for event organizer Lopavent remain on trial. In its proposal, the court said that because of the pandemic, it wasn’t possible to foresee when and how the trial could resume. The last trial session was held March 4. The next is scheduled for April 21, but it now is unclear if it will take place. Germany recorded more than 100,000 confirmed virus cases as of Tuesday.

She noted the area surrounding the pavilion will include “pavers” or bricked areas with picnic tables where residents can walk, sit and enjoy themselves near the ponds.
 “In the pavilion, we’ve already priced out a big sound system so that we can have live entertainment down there,” Ingersoll added.
 “There will also be a huge deck with cantilevers and railings over the pond, so (residents) can sit or fish right into the pond.”
 Ingersoll noted there will also be sidewalks leading from the front parking lot to the pavilion and pond area located behind the Field of Dreams facility. There will also be a seating area beneath a lone, large tree in the field near the main building.
 “That way, it gives the ability for people to get out and look back to the park area and facility,” she remarked. “It will also get them out among the sunflowers that will be in the field.”
 Ingersoll said she believes the project will be completed quickly.
 “Our original goal was to have this up and running for a picnic party on July 4th, but I think it will be done long before that,” she conjectured. “Once this (pandemic) is over, and families can join (residents) and go down there and picnic and take them out … it will be someplace outdoors they can spend time with their loved ones.”

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — A Canadian company said Monday that it's started construction on the long-stalled Keystone XL oil sands pipeline across the U.S.-Canada border, despite calls from tribal leaders and environmentalists to delay the $8 billion project amid the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesman for TC Energy said work began over the weekend at the border crossing in northern Montana, a remote area with sprawling cattle ranches and wheat fields. About 100 workers will be involved in the pipeline's early stages, but that number is expected to swell into the thousands in coming months as work proceeds, according to the company. The 1,200 mile (1,930 kilometer) pipeline was proposed in 2008 and would carry up to 830,000 barrels (35 million gallons) of crude daily for transfer to refineries and export terminals on the Gulf of Mexico. It's been tied up for years in legal battles and several court challenges are still pending, including one that's due before a judge next week. TC Energy's surprise March 31 announcement that it intended to start construction came after the provincial government in Alberta invested $1.1 billion to jump start work. Montana's Department of Environmental Quality on Friday issued the final state permits the company needed, agency spokeswoman Rebecca Harbage said. Leaders of American Indian tribes and some residents of rural communities along the pipeline route worry that workers could spread the coronavirus. As many as 11 construction camps, some housing up to 1,000 people, were initially planned for the project, although TC Energy says those are under review because of the virus. TC Energy says it plans to check everyone entering work sites for fever and ensure workers practice social distancing. Work on the pipeline is allowed under an...

Days after raising hopes of a return by the start of May amid the coronavirus outbreak, British horse racing organizers announced the postponement of two of their biggest flat-racing festivals and added that the prestigious Royal Ascot meeting might only be staged without the public. The Guineas Festival at Newmarket on May 2-3 and the English Derby Festival at Epsom on June 5-6 will not take place on those dates, The Jockey Club said Tuesday, removing two of the few remaining major events on a British sporting calendar otherwise wiped out by the pandemic. Then came the announcement that Royal Ascot on June 16-20, an event typically attended by Queen Elizabeth II and other royals, would not be open to the public - if the event can take place at all. “It may prove possible to run the Royal Ascot races behind closed doors, dependent on government and public health policy and the approval of the British Horseracing Authority for us to restart racing,” Ascot Racecourse said. “This would be for the benefit of the industry, our valued partners and suppliers and our television audiences at home and internationally. “Planning for this is now our complete focus.” Organizers said they were looking at alternative dates for the Newmarket and Epsom meetings “given the importance of (them) to the careers of that generation of horses, and the racing and bloodstock industries as a whole.” The Derby is the most prestigious flat race in Britain, while the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas - two of the other “Classics” in the British racing calendar - take place at the Newmarket meeting in early May. The Jockey Club said a decision needed to be made on postponing the meetings as trainers wanted to know whether to step up preparations for the races. Racing has officially been...

The local arts scene has always had a lot of eccentric, offbeat little corners. On a given Monday night, for example, you could catch the open mic at Funky Murphy's, or Comedy in the Cabaret at Nick's, or the Dirty Gerund Poetry series at Ralph's. These are regularly scheduled events that not only showcase and develop artists and audiences, they also foster community. For many regular attendees of these shows, their being shuttered because of the pandemic has been a bigger loss than a night's entertainment. Thankfully, those shows have found new lives online.
 "It's been going great surprisingly," says singer-songwriter Matt Soper, who hosts the Songwriters' Mind series Wednesday nights at starlite gallery in Southbridge. "We've built a tight-knit community of songwriters and fans that have really rallied behind the live streams. If you join one of our watch parties, the comment section almost feels as if you were at starlite having at drink."
 Soper's been hosting nights of eight songwriters, each going live from their own Facebook page. A watch party of the live stream is then shared to the show's Facebook group. It's one of many ways to do it, on a variety of platforms, but for the organizers of these shows, it's about holding those communities together as much as it is about sharing art.
 "Obviously, everyone is feeling terribly isolated right now during these scary times," says poet Alex Charalambides, who hosts the Gerund. "These spaces are offering a vital connection for some. Weekly events like ours become part of the fabric of our routines, like church, like the gym, like school. We value it. Seeing the faces all together on a screen doesn't quite match seeing them in the audience, but it's real."
 Jeff Campbell, who has been helping coordinate the online show process for the Listen Sunday poetry series with regulars Heath Bleau and his daughter, Storey Campbell, says the shows have been going well. "We have been able to maintain connections with old friends and regulars," he said. "I think it was (host Dave Macpherson) who observed it sucks that we can't quite reach out to folks who were more on the periphery. But on the other hand, there have been a few attenders who never could have made it in real life. I was really surprised when we started doing it how much I missed those people and that part of my routine."
 Facebook Live has been a popular vehicle for delivering these shows, but others have opted for Instagram Live, Zoom or Discord, each to varying effects, and some are still experimenting with platforms. For the online version of Listen, Campbell says, "the first week we did a group message in a Discord server. That gets about a B, in my opinion. We then did Instagram. This Sunday we will do Zoom. We will then take a vote on favorite platform of those 3 and stick with that."
 Storey Campbell says that "Discord has plenty of admin controls, but lacks video in calls with more than 10 people. I think its reliability and chat features more than make up for it. (Charlambides and Nikk Lessard) of the Dirty Gerund did a show via Zoom, and that went well."
 Michael Robert Kelly, who hosts the Thursday night open mic at Slater's in Bolton, went about producing an online version in a completely different way. "I realized I wanted to keep my Open Mike Slater's community together but there was no platform to really do one live," he says. "So, I figured I wanted to at least get videos from people and put something together. Luckily I have some die-hard people who come most weeks to Slater's, and I like to keep up with them and keep them in the loop of what I'm doing. The response was great and with everybody's help the online method has worked out great so far!"
 Danielle DeLucia, lead singer of the band Auntie Trainwreck, is doing something similar with the Sunday open mic at Rascal's. "I am still having people sign up for slots ahead of time like they did when we were doing the open mic in person, but now I am having them send me a 20-minute video of them playing and sharing the videos online in our event page at the exact time that they signed up."
 It's an evolving process, but one in which it seems both audiences and artists are invested. Rick Hamel, who runs the Monday open mic at Funky Murphy's, says, "The last two Mondays we went online and I had 10 musicians play each time for about 15 minutes each. I have teenagers that come to my open mic regularly and it gives them something to do (not just attending the open mic, but practicing to get ready). For everyone, I think it gives them a sense of normalcy because we're all continuing to do something we used to do week after week."
 Still, supporting the artists that regularly play these shows remains a paramount concern. "We recognize the difficulty for artists who perform live," says Charalambides. "As a community we pride ourselves on paying artists for their time and talents, so it was also important to put in some systems to try to replicate that as well. We set up a Paypal for the show, posted our featured artists digital pay profiles, and found some success in the first week of paying a featured performer and auctioning off our guest visual artists live painting."
 Other shows have displayed their performers' Paypal or Venmo information in order for people to "tip" the artist directly. Other groups have used the platform as a way to help support the people who've supported them over the years. For example, Shaun Connolly -- one of the organizers of the Wootenany comedy festival, with Bryan O'Donnell -- says that at streams of the Monday night comedy show and Connolly's "Sort of Late Show," they've taken tips to help Nick's bartender Sean Courtney recoup the money he would have made tending bar during those shows.
 On the whole, there seems to be a broad consensus that the online stopgap measure is doing its job and helping keep those communities together. Perhaps even more surprising, some of the organizers have conceded they're enjoying the arrangement.
 "The biggest surprise has been how much fun I've been having doing it," says Soper. "I'm able to book incredible lineups where you might see songwriters like Gracie Day, Nate Cozzolino and Kala Farnham all in the same night. Something that probably wouldn't be possible on a normal Wednesday night in Southbridge."
 DeLucia concurs, saying, "Having some people jump in and give it a try that have never performed at the open mic in person was a nice surprise. And having people 'watch' and comment and like the links and posts has been nice. It's upped our visibility a bit and hopefully that will translate into more in- person attendance when we're back up and running at Rascal's."
 Of course, as Jeff Campbell notes, "in some ways physical distance is irrelevant right now." He had a friend in California participate in the Listen open reading livestream. Conversely, Worcester poet Ashley Wonder says she's enjoyed being able to watch readings in Boston and New York. But still, it's clear many are antsy to get back to their regular shows.
 "My life has always revolved around seeing live music," says music lover and photographer Ted Theodore, "so these windows with the artist are very important to me. Being able to see them play, seeing the room fill up and chatting and 'clapping' along with the community is almost like being there. It will never replace the feel of the room, so I am hoping for a return to normal."

 Independent TD Michael Lowry, a member of the Regional Independent Group, has said he is willing to support a government from the opposition benches if a deal with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil can be reached.
 Mr Lowry said he is waiting to see the text of the document that the two parties will present, but he and his colleagues are ready to stand up and be counted in the national interest. It is clear a number of the group are willing to consider serving as ministers in a government.

Norway, one of the first European countries to curb activities to rein in the spread of the coronavirus, will relax restrictions "little by little", the prime minister says.
 The Nordic country's lockdown sent the economy into a tailspin and triggered hundreds of thousands of lay-offs.
 "Together we have taken control of the virus, therefore we can open up society little by little," Erna Solberg told a news conference on Tuesday.
 On Monday, her health minister said the epidemic was "under control" in Norway, pointing to the low rate of transmission.
 Current restrictions, which are in place until April 13, include the closure of nurseries and schools, refusing entry to foreigners who do not live and work in Norway and forbidding people to go to their mountain cabins if they have one.
 Kindergartens will reopen between April 20 and 27, schools from the first grade to the fourth grade will reopen from April 27 and Norwegians can go to their chalets from April 20.
 At the same time, working from home must continue and Norwegians must get used to measures against contamination "for a long time," Solberg said.
 As of Tuesday, 5863 people had tested positive for the coronavirus, up from 5,755 reported on Monday, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said, and 69 people have died of the disease.
 Norway's rate of unemployment rose to 15.4% on Tuesday, the Labour and Welfare Agency said, the highest level on record, up from 14.7% on March 31, as the economy ground to a halt.
 Norway is the latest country to ease some of its restrictions.
 Denmark, which followed a similarly tough line to Norway, announced late on Monday it would reopen day care centres and schools on April 15 as a first step to gradually relaxing its three-week lockdown.

Less than 100 days after the coronavirus epidemic took hold in China and spread across the world, the scientific, medical, and pharmaceutical sectors are focussing research efforts on finding a new treatment or vaccine as well as testing the potential use of existing medicines.
 The Covid-19 pandemic has so far killed more than 75,000 people and infected over 1.3 million people worldwide.
 In January, just weeks after Covid-19 took hold in China, researchers mapped the genetic code of the virus and shared it globally so that other scientists could develop tests and begin the search for a vaccine.
 Already 41 companies and institutes are researching ways to produce a vaccine for Covid-19, while the potential of 23 anti-inflammatory drugs and six anti- viral treatments are also being investigated.
 Pharmaceutical giant, Johnson and Johnson, is one company that is leading the way having invested $500 million (€460m) to develop a Covid-19 vaccine and committing to making any new vaccine affordable.
 Experts say, in reality, it may take anywhere from 18 months to several years before a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available.
 Professor Sam McConkey, an infectious disease specialist at RCSI, told the AMI conference it can take years to take research from the laboratory to a tried and tested medical treatment.

In its new guidelines set Friday, the CDC said studies have shown that “a significant portion” of people with the virus have no symptoms and can still spread the virus. “In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”

But this is not a system of "anything goes," far from it!  Why?  Because a Libertarian society where contracts and warranties are enforced provides for accountability and personal responsibility at all levels of society -- individual, corporate and governmental.  For example, the Libertarian agenda of transforming today's government-controlled health care industry back to one that is market-driven and market-regulated will result in an explosion in medical innovation, treatments and cures, as well as reduced costs. And since we all are at risk of potentially any human disease, these innovations will result in greater chances for longer and healthier lives for all of us.  And the same results will be seen in almost all other aspects of our lives as well.

“For me, it is all about delivery and the ability to deliver. People voted for change and while we are in straightened times, that change must be delivered.”
 A former Fine Gael candidate who was de-selected, Ms Murphy said she harbours no ill-will toward her former party.
 “What’s done is done, they de-selected me, I got elected and it’s water under the bridge,” she said.
 Tánaiste Simon Coveney said he wants to discuss formation with the smaller parties and independents.
 “Certainly, I think it’s possible for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael working with independents and independent groups to form a majority,” he said.
 “We want to try to include other political parties outside of those two parties as well.
 "That’s why we have focused on trying to put a framework document together which, I think, will certainly attempt to persuade parties like the Green Party and the Social Democrats and the Labour Party that actually, politics is going to be different.”
