WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) — There will be more sobriety checkpoints and police patrols targeting impaired driving in Maui ahead of St. Patrick's Day, authorities said. Police began Friday conducting sobriety test checkpoints and increasing patrols with plans to continue measures through St. Patrick's Day on Tuesday, the Maui News reported. “Our goal is to promote voluntary compliance of all traffic laws and reduce motor vehicle crashes on our roadways,” the department said in a news release. Legislation signed into law in December allows police to tow vehicles operated by drivers who are arrested for driving under the influence, driving without a license or driving after their license is suspended or revoked for impaired driving, authorities said. People who have been drinking are encouraged to use ride-sharing or taxi services or call a sober friend or family member, police said. Increased enforcement comes after events and holiday celebrations worldwide were upended by the coronavirus concerns. The St. Patrick's Day block party in downtown Honolulu was one of many events in the state to cancel this week. New York, Chicago, Boston, and even the Irish capital of Dublin, have also canceled St. Patrick's Day parades.

Appliances and consumer electronics industry, which source components mainly from China, maybe in the red zone if the supply of materials impacted by coronavirus pandemic does not improve by next month, according to an industry body. Prices of consumer durables products as air conditioners, televisions, and refrigerators, are being revised by the manufacturers due to supply constraints, the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association CEAMA said.According to the CEAMA, though factories in China have started operating they are still operating at around half of their capacity. Moreover, if the availability does not improve by April, then the industry would be in the red zone. The coronavirus attack had a negative impact on the consumer durables sector due to its dependency on imports from China - be it for finished goods or components. We have received reports that plants in China are operating at 50-60 percent capacity, but production has begun now, CEAMA President Kamal Nandi said.Prices for consumer durables, especially in categories like ACs, televisions, and refrigerators, are being revised by industry players, he said adding, As of now the finished goods are available but the industry will be in the red zone if things dont improve by April. The Indian appliances and consumer electronics industry is largely dependent on China for the sourcing of components and some of the finished goods. According to a joint report by CEAMA and Frost Sullivan, the industry had a total market size of Rs 76,400 crore in 2018-19, in which Rs 32,200 crore was contributed from domestic manufacturing. While, Nandi who is also Godrej Appliances Business Head and Executive Vice President, said that it is increasing the prices of its range of Acs from 2 percent to 3 percent.Godrej will be taking a 2-3 percent price hike in ACs in the second half of March, he said. The short supply of components, increase in customs duty and higher logistical cost of airlifting components are key triggers for the price hike. Given the high seasonality of cooling categories like ACs and refrigerators, the shortage of stocks is bound to hit revenue for summer, he added.

The GST Councils decision to hike tax on mobile phones to 18 per cent will make handsets costlier and hit domestic consumption as well as Make in India programme, industry players said on Saturday. This was time for statesmanship especially when the country is going through a crisis and as a nation, we have fallen short, ICEA chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said. He said that the increase of GST from 12 per cent to 18 per cent will be extremely detrimental to the vision of Digital India.Consumption will be stymied and our domestic consumption target of USD 80 billion Rs 6 lakh crores by 2025 will not be achieved. We will fall short by at least Rs 2 lakh crores, Mohindroo said. The government under National Policy on Electronics 2019 has set target to create a Rs 26 lakh crore domestic electronics manufacturing ecosystem by 2025. This includes production of 1 billion mobile handsets valued at around Rs 13 lakh crore comprising Rs 5 lakh crore domestic sales and exports worth Rs 7 lakh crore. The targets were set in terms of USD and due to variation in exchange rate the domestic market target has swelled by another Rs 1 lakh crore.  The industry body had approached Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on March 12 against proposal to hike GST on mobile phone saying that it will be detrimental for consumer sentiments buying handsets and in turn impact local manufacturing of the devices.ICEA had said that the industry is under deep stress because of disruption in the supply chain due to coronavirus and it is very inappropriate time to consider hike in GST rate of mobile phones from current level of 12 per cent. The GST Council on Saturday decided to increase tax rate by 6 percentage points on mobiles and certain components from April 1 due to the inverted duty structure, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.Counterpoint Research Associate Director Tarun Pathak said, This will impact the pricing and especially at a time when we are staring at uncertainty in the larger electronics supply chain due to coronavirus. An increase in price means a section of users will either go for second hand or even turn to grey market. Chinese handset maker Xiaomi noted that the entire smartphone industry has been committed to Prime Ministers flagship Make In India initiative. But todays recommendation by the GST Council to raise the GST rate on mobile phones from 12 to 18 will seriously harm the entire industry. It mentioned that Indias smartphone industry is already struggling with profitability due to depreciating rupee against the dollar and is also facing supply chain disruption due to the current COVID-19 situation.As a result of this GST increase, all smartphone makers will be forced to increase prices. This can weaken the demand and mobile industrys Make in India program. This could also have long lasting impact on internet penetration and digital India program as majority of Indians access internet on smartphones, Manu Jain, Managing Director, Xiaomi India, said..

But the platforms have featured public service announcements from the World Health Organization, and national disease control organisations. Announcements about cancellations of events, travel bans, and local news pertaining to the virus, have rapidly gone viral. The concept of social distancing -- avoiding physical contact and keeping a metre's distance between individuals -- has also been spread on social media. Winnowing out fake news and misinformation from the verifiable and useful has been difficult, even on a war footing. Google, and its subsidiary YouTube, have worked overtime to remove ads, and videos advocating nonsensical practices, and ads selling therapeutically useless substances. Google has also tried to clear out fake news on keyword searches and it has given governments, multilaterals, and NGOs free ad space. By and large, Facebook, Twitter, and Google have amplified the verified and credible, even if they have not succeeded in eradicating the false.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Oklahoma City Ballet has canceled all performances of this weekend's "Future Voices: A Choreographic Showcase."
 "This is a very difficult decision for us to make, but the health and safety of our patrons, dancers, students, and staff is our top priority," reads a statement issued Friday by the nonprofit arts organization.
 As previously reported, "Future Voices" was to have the OKC Ballet dancers performing short works choreographed by about a dozen OKC Ballet staffers and dancers, plus special guests, in the Inasmuch Foundation Theatre at OKC Ballet's Susan E. Brackett Dance Center.
 Intended to be an annual event, "Future Voices" was to be one of the first ticketed performances at the new dance center, capping a goal the arts organization set when it began renovating the former American Energy Partners Fitness Center into a top-notch dance facility more than three years ago.
