  _\"He who feed a hungry animal, feeds his own soul\" ~Charlie Chaplin_
 Even though our lives seem to have stopped as we shelter in place, the wild world is still tick tocking along. The weather has been so mild this winter that I've noticed many animals have migrated back or come out of hibernation early. Have you noticed? The problem with that, besides those freezing days that pop in once in a while, is that there isn't a lot of spring food ready yet.
 Many of the plants are just starting to poke through the ground. Finding food seems like it would be tough for the animals. On my walks, I would see frog eggs one day and the next they were gone. I'm sure some hungry raccoon enjoyed those eggs. Luckily, on warm days, I still hear many frogs singing for a mate.
 There are some cool things for nature watchers, though. Because the leaves are just starting to fill in, some bird nests are more visible. I have also seen some rabbit dens.
 Mother nature is finally catching up with the early cycling of animals clocks and more food is becoming available. So if you only feed the animals in winter (which is highly commendable), I would ask that you feed them for a couple more weeks to help them out.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) senior leader Jahangir Tareen, who is under fire over his alleged involvement in the sugar crisis, questioned the criteria behind the audit of his nine sugar mills and the selection process by the committee formed to probe the matter.
 The PTI leader said that he does not object to the audit of his sugar mills under the committee.
 "Will the commission discover the reality behind all the sugar mills in Pakistan after conducting an audit of the nine mills?" said the businessman. The PTI senior leader reportedly had a fallout with Prime Minister Imran Khan after a Federal Investigation Agency's report on the sugar crisis named him, along with Khusro Bakhtyar's brother, as persons who benefited the most from the episode. Following the investigation into the price hike that came under the premier's radar back in February, the report stirred up a storm for some top ministers and PTI leaders. Despite a heavy shuffling in the federal cabinet, including a change in portfolio of food security minister Khusro Bakhtyar, President Arif Alvi had said that the PTI government is not in troubled waters. The prime minister and the president both put their weight behind the detailed forensic report, with the former threatening strict action against profiteers. "I await the detailed forensic reports now by the high- powered commission, which will come out on 25 April, before taking action," the prime minister had said in a tweet. Tareen had responded to the revelations made in the report, saying he would challenge the committee investigating the sugar and wheat crises if it held him responsible. Tareen, PTI's former general secretary, said that out of the Rs3bn subsidy to the sugar mills, Rs2.5 billion were given when the PML-N was in power. In an earlier tweet, Tareen provided explanation on the crisis.

There are too many arrogant Christian leaders. A lot of the time, I wonder if they remember who the church is. COVID-19 has reminded them that the people, the congregations, are the church. Take people out of the equation and what you have are buildings and auditoriums, which can easily be converted to cinema halls, event centres, warehouses and even night clubs. All of a sudden, we do not have to go to “Jerusalem” any longer, even on Sundays, to worship God. Christians now worship God in the comfort of their homes even on Sundays. Without their congregations, pastors are shepherds without sheep. The glory of a leader are the people. Christian leaders should treat their congregations well. The welfare of their congregations should also be paramount, not building of palaces, acquiring of the state of the art vehicles, and adorning of designer suits and wristwatches, etc. without church services, the suits and designer accessories are now idle in their wardrobes.

PESHAWAR: Even though the struggle to contain coronavirus needs unity, particularly in the ruling party, the differences among Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf (PTI) lawmakers were visible when Chief Minister Mahmood Khan visited Mardan on April 7 to take stock of the situation in the district most affected by the Covid-19 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
 Former senior minister Mohammad Atif Khan and MPAs Zahir Shah Toru, TufailAnjum and SajidaHanif were conspicuous by their absence during the events that the chief minister attended in Mardan. They reportedly weren't invited to any of these events. One of the MPAs said they were expecting an invitation but it didn't arrive. These four lawmakers from Mardan are seen to be in the anti-Mahmood Khan group in the PTI.
 However, the PK-49 Mardan MPA TufailAnjum said he was on good terms with all, including those considered close to the chief minister.
 It was the chief minister's first visit to Mardan after the formation of the PTI government in the province following the July 2018 general election. Though he had come specifically to review the coronavirus situation in Mardan, opposition members and some media persons in Mardan criticized him for not announcing any 'special development package' for the district. However, Mahmood Khan's supporters argued this wasn't the time to expect the chief minister to allocate special funds for a district when the priority is to tackle the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Atif Khan, along with provincial ministers Shahram Khan Tarakai and Shakil Ahmad, were summarily removed from the cabinet on disciplinary grounds in late January when Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is also chairman of the PTI, sided with Mahmood Khan in the tussle between the two groups. Though Atif Khan and ShahramTarakai were later invited by the prime minister for a meeting to listen to their version, the issue is still unresolved and it isn't known if and when the sacked ministers would be reinstated. With strong support from Imran Khan, Chief Minister Mahmood Khan is taking his time to decide the return of the axed ministers.
 The other four PTI MPAs from Mardan including IftikharMashwani, Amir Farzand, Abdul Salam Afridi and Malik Shaukatstood by the chief minister and are in his good books.
 The differences in the PTI in Mardan, the second biggest district in KP after Peshawar, were also evident during a recent teleconference that was hosted by the party's lawmaker Zahir Shah Toru and organized and chaired by Atif Khan. Though Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan, KP Health Minister TaimurSaleemJhagra and Mardan MNA Mujahid Khan, all belonging to the PTI, attended the teleconference, the four party MPAs opposed to Atif Khan didn't attend the event.
 The PTI is clearly divided into two camps in Mardan, causing pain to party activists. They want the PTI leadership to take steps to resolve the differences as inaction was widening the gulf between the two sides. Though sources close to Atif Khan said he has met the prime minister again, the latter obviously has to focus first on containing the coronavirus pandemic and reviving Pakistan'sbattered economy and saving livelihoods.

While we are far behind in tracking and testing and have not even met the minimum standard yet, the only option left is more and more social distancing via effective lockdown and meaningful awareness campaign but the Centre wants to relax the same to generate some economic activities.
 All agreed that one of the reasons why there are less coronavirus patients compared to most of the countries around the world is lack of tracking and testing but the positive sign is that we also have less death rate, which has reached 100 mark although federal minister Sarwar Khan has warned that it could reach 700 by April 25 with 70,000 tests. So, unless we built our capacity to meet the challenges and bring less pressure on doctors, paramedics and lab technicians, more effective lockdown looked the only option and let people stay at home to the maximum.
 There is a consensus among the medical experts that the peak to the virus is yet to come in Pakistan and likely to hit by the end of this month and opening of certain sectors and industries at this stage perhaps could aggravate the situation.
 In all possibilities, Centre and provinces may go for more ‘lockdown’ but a selective and targeted one and federal government may also ask Sindh to follow it. Yes, they may take the risk of allowing certain sectors to resume their activities.
 The areas, which may remain under lockdown, include big shopping plazas, parks, playgrounds, restaurants, sea side and public and private transport while educational institutions are already closed till May.
 However, Centre and provinces need to agree on opening of some sectors like construction and its related industries as well as food and pharmaceutical companies. Sindh may stress the need for ‘complete lockdown’ at least for one more week after April 14, till the peak of the virus but the Centre led by Prime Minister Imran Khan may go for some major ‘relaxation’ in the lockdown and allow some economic activity in the shape of making construction sector functional, exports etc.
 However, Sindh too under pressure and in the recent meetings with the chief minister, the industrialists and businessmen took some tough stance and warned the provincial government in regard to massive unemployment if government continued with tough lockdown policy.
 Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah may be right in his assessment that at least strict lockdown should continue till peak is over but his decisions are not drawing popular response as compared to that of the prime minister and the federal government.
 But in case of virus outbreak after opening of certain sectors like constructions and dozens of other related industries as well as transport, Centre would be held responsible. Sindh believes that had the Centre allowed countrywide lockdown from March 15 to March 30, and closed borders and flights, thing would not have been as bad as today. “These are difficult times and required difficult decisions as economic recession in this situation may take much longer than it was during 2008 recession,” PM’s adviser and former governor State Bank, Dr Ishrat Hussain said while talking to this scribe on phone from Islamabad.
 “Pakistan has to go at a fast pace with more testing, tracking and quarantine but at the same time need to resume some economic activities like exports,” he added.
 Dr Ishrat Hussain believes that social distancing is easy in the construction sector but it also means resuming activities in at least 41 sectors like cement and steel. He agreed that to bring labourers, they also have to relax public or private transport.
 Thus, I will go for selected and targeted lockdown as complete lockdown could have far reaching adverse impact on our already fragile economy.
 “I go for complete lockdown at least for one more week as the peak is yet to come and we still do not have enough testing kits nor ventilators and any large scale outbreak would be difficult to tackle with,” Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said while talking to some TV anchors and a group of senior journalists at the CM House Thursday.
 He also cautioned the prime minister to evolve a better mechanism for distribution of Rs12,000 each to the poor under Ehsaas Relief Package, as what happened Thursday in some cities where hundreds of people had gathered and could have caused ‘virus’ in many people.
 “I am not against the relief programme but we have to set priorities whether we want to save people from virus first,” he added.
 However, Prime Minister Imran Khan is still not fully convinced with complete lockdown theory and in the last two weeks has taken some more popular decisions like the ‘amnesty scheme’ for the construction sector and record Rs140 billion relief package under ‘Ehsaas Relief Programme’, with cash distribution of Rs 12,000 each to the poor registered for four months.
 Federal government has already relaxed restrictions on international flights but only to bring Pakistanis from different countries and also allowed foreign nationals to leave.
 When the National Coordination Committee met on April 1, and decided for countrywide ‘lockdown’ and to raise the capacity of testing kits, it has yet to reach its target till now although NDMA, confident that it would meet the requirement soon.
 Situation in Punjab deteriorated after Tablighi Jamaat Ijtima, like what happened in case of Sindh, when the first batch of ‘Zaireen’ from Qum arrived through Taftan border. However, the religious scholars and ulema played a positive role in convincing people to say their Friday prayers at home.
 The real test for the federal and provincial governments would be during Ramazan, which will start from April 25, if not 24th, and also at the time of Eid, the biggest ever festivity for Muslims around the world.
 Markets, shopping plazas may lose billions of rupees only in Ramazan, if situation did not improve and shops, markets remain closed.
 “I know that lockdown city like Karachi means lockdown economic hub but do we have an alternate,” Murad Ali Shah said, adding that if we lockdown till the beginning of Ramazan in an effective manner we will be able to allow economic activity during the holy month.
 Thus, the plea of Sindh chief minister to continue with ‘lockdown’ at least till peak is over, meaning by the end of this month makes some sense.
 It is a test for both Centre and the provinces and any decision should be taken keeping the possible consequences as a result of possible outbreak of virus as well as country’s economy, which is in ‘ICU’ if not on ventilator’ for some time.

“We can hide, we can help, we can protect,” Polkinghorne said.
 Like in Mendocino, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office and police in Santa Rosa and Petaluma have also seen a decrease in calls for help since the start of local shelter-in-place orders, though neither reported significant increases in domestic violence or child abuse cases.
 Over the past three weeks, deputies documented three more cases of domestic violence compared to the same time frame last year, said Sonoma County Sheriff’s spokesman Juan Valencia. Deputies filed 24% fewer child abuse and neglect reports during that same time, down from 39 in 2019 for that same time frame.
 From February to the start of April, Santa Rosa officers responded to 9% fewer domestic violence incidents than the year before, according to data provided by Santa Rosa Police Sgt. Brenda Harrington, who oversees the agency’s domestic violence and sexual assault investigations unit.
 In Petaluma, domestic violence reports decreased by 25% and child abuse reports dropped by 33% compared to the year prior, beginning from when Sonoma County health officials announced they would require residents to shelter-in- place to this past Friday.
 Petaluma Police Chief Ken Savano warned those figures were only indicative of how many people were calling police for help, however, and not a complete picture of how many of those crimes were occurring in the community.
 People may be more hesitant to call 911 if they believe local police are too busy to help or have other, more pressing issues to deal with in light of the pandemic, Savano said. Reporting such abuse is often difficult enough as it is.
 What’s more, virus-related closures of school campuses and daycares and limited contacts with the outside world may mean that mandated reporters of abuse, including teachers and doctors, will have fewer opportunities to detect it, said Robin Bowen, the executive director of Sonoma County’s Child Parent Institute, a nonprofit whose mission is to end child abuse.
 Despite the lack of a surge in reports of abuse in Sonoma County, agencies remain ready.
 “In times like this, when there’s uncertainty over income and your ability to be able to go out on your own, sometimes people feel they can’t get away or won’t be able to get away form their abuser,” Savano said. “Our message to anyone out there that is experiencing violence is that there’s help.”
 Madeleine Keegan O’Connell, the CEO of YWCA Sonoma County, which operates the county’s only 24-7 domestic violence hotline, says calls to the organization remain steady, but she anticipates a surge in weeks to come.
 They, too, have shifted from in-person therapy sessions to ones done over the phone, and their shelter is still operating, though with accommodations to allow for social distancing, O’Connell said.
 “The spike will come, we’re not there yet mostly because of the shelter in place,” O’Connell said. “If you are sheltering in place with you abuser, you’re not able to privately get to a telephone to get to that call.”
 Sonoma County District Attorney Jill Ravitch, who opened the county’s Family Justice Center in 2011, a one-stop shop for people seeking resources for various types of familial abuse, said calls to the center were also unchanged. While the center closed its building because it was not deemed an essential business under county health orders, agencies housed there, such as the YWCA and Verity, Sonoma County’s rape crisis center, were still operating remotely.
 “The services continue to be in place to provide assistance through the Family Justice Center and our partners,” Ravitch wrote in an email. “All anyone needs to do is ask.”
 Mounting stress caused by the pandemic is likely testing relationships between parents and children as well, said Bowen of the Child Parent Institute.
 To combat that, the nonprofit has moved parenting classes and family counseling sessions to virtual platforms. The institute’s diaper bank, initially set up after the 2017 Northern California wildfires, has provided diapers and wipes for nearly 1,000 families since late February, an increase in demand for the assistance as local stores experience shortages for the product and job cuts impact families already in need, Bowen said.
 “Parents are looking for support,” Bowen said. “What happens when parents can’t find the resources they need to provide for their families? The stress increases.”

Los Angeles prosecutors have slapped incarcerated rapist Harvey Weinstein with a new sexual battery charge.
 The disgraced movie mogul, who is currently serving 23 years behind bars in New York, already had four felony counts filed against him in Los Angeles in January, and on Friday, authorities added one more to the list.
 The sexual battery charge relates to an alleged incident which took place at a Beverly Hills hotel in May, 2010.
 According to TMZ, the reported victim was previously interviewed by detectives about the encounter in October, but only provided further information to confirm it did not fall outside of the 10-year statute of limitations last month.
 Weinstein was already facing allegations of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force, and sexual battery by restraint from two women who claim Weinstein attacked them in individual hotel encounters in 2013.
 If convicted, the producer, who is recovering from contracting COVID-19, faces up to 29 years in prison.
 Prior to the chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic, prosecutors had started the process of seeking Weinstein's extradition from New York to Los Angeles to answer to the charges.
 The news emerges as officials announced two other cases involving sex allegations against Weinstein had been dropped as the reported victims did not want to testify against the 68 year old in court.

Knowing fully well 'lockdown' and social distancing the only prevention from one of the most dangerous diseases in a century' called 'coronavirus', which has already claimed one lakh deaths around the world and spreading fast in Pakistan, political divide persist over handling of the situation and whether to go for complete or selected lockdown, when the National Coordination Committee will meet again on April 14, to take the decision.

ISLAMABAD: Chairman Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Bilawal Bhutto Zardari Friday said constitution was the soul of a state and tearing it means tearing apart the state itself and ridiculing it means ridiculing the people and those who tore up the Constitution must be brought to Justice.
 "Constitution is a sacrosanct social contract between the state and citizens on the one hand and the glue that binds the federating units together on the other. Abrogating it means dismembering the federation and alienating the citizen from the state," he said on the Constitution Day on Friday. The Constitution of Pakistan 1973 was adopted by the National Assembly on April 10 in 1973.
 Bilawal also called for punishing those "treasonous elements who abrogated and subverted this foundational document of the state for personal power and ambitions. "It is a national disgrace that a dictator abrogated the Constitution in 1977 later ridiculing it as 'a mere 15-page document' that he boasted could be torn at will," he said. He said those who tore and ridiculed the Constitution were traitors and dictators and usurpers must be punished; they will be in the fullness of time.
 "A dictator who tore up the Constitution and is on the run must be brought back to face the law," he said.

"He who feed a hungry animal, feeds his own soul" ~Charlie Chaplin
 Even though our lives seem to have stopped as we shelter in place, the wild world is still tick tocking along. The weather has been so mild this winter that I've noticed many animals have migrated back or come out of hibernation early. Have you noticed? The problem with that, besides those freezing days that pop in once in a while, is that there isn't a lot of spring food ready yet.
 Many of the plants are just starting to poke through the ground. Finding food seems like it would be tough for the animals. On my walks, I would see frog eggs one day and the next they were gone. I'm sure some hungry raccoon enjoyed those eggs. Luckily, on warm days, I still hear many frogs singing for a mate.
 There are some cool things for nature watchers, though. Because the leaves are just starting to fill in, some bird nests are more visible. I have also seen some rabbit dens.
 Mother nature is finally catching up with the early cycling of animals clocks and more food is becoming available. So if you only feed the animals in winter (which is highly commendable), I would ask that you feed them for a couple more weeks to help them out.

While we are far behind in tracking and testing and have not even met the minimum standard yet, the only option left is more and more social distancing via effective lockdown and meaningful awareness campaign but the Centre wants to relax the same to generate some economic activities.
 All agreed that one of the reasons why there are less coronavirus patients compared to most of the countries around the world is lack of tracking and testing but the positive sign is that we also have less death rate, which has reached 100 mark although federal minister Sarwar Khan has warned that it could reach 700 by April 25 with 70,000 tests.
 So, unless we built our capacity to meet the challenges and bring less pressure on doctors, paramedics and lab technicians, more effective lockdown looked the only option and let people stay at home to the maximum.
 There is a consensus among the medical experts that the peak to the virus is yet to come in Pakistan and likely to hit by the end of this month and opening of certain sectors and industries at this stage perhaps could aggravate the situation.
 In all possibilities, Centre and provinces may go for more ‘lockdown’ but a selective and targeted one and federal government may also ask Sindh to follow it. Yes, they may take the risk of allowing certain sectors to resume their activities.
 The areas, which may remain under lockdown, include big shopping plazas, parks, playgrounds, restaurants, sea side and public and private transport while educational institutions are already closed till May.
 However, Centre and provinces need to agree on opening of some sectors like construction and its related industries as well as food and pharmaceutical companies.
 Sindh may stress the need for ‘complete lockdown’ at least for one more week after April 14, till the peak of the virus but the Centre led by Prime Minister Imran Khan may go for some major ‘relaxation’ in the lockdown and allow some economic activity in the shape of making construction sector functional, exports etc.
 However, Sindh too under pressure and in the recent meetings with the chief minister, the industrialists and businessmen took some tough stance and warned the provincial government in regard to massive unemployment if government continued with tough lockdown policy.
 Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah may be right in his assessment that at least strict lockdown should continue till peak is over but his decisions are not drawing popular response as compared to that of the prime minister and the federal government.
 But in case of virus outbreak after opening of certain sectors like constructions and dozens of other related industries as well as transport, Centre would be held responsible. Sindh believes that had the Centre allowed countrywide lockdown from March 15 to March 30, and closed borders and flights, thing would not have been as bad as today.
 “These are difficult times and required difficult decisions as economic recession in this situation may take much longer than it was during 2008 recession,” PM’s adviser and former governor State Bank, Dr Ishrat Hussain said while talking to this scribe on phone from Islamabad.
 “Pakistan has to go at a fast pace with more testing, tracking and quarantine but at the same time need to resume some economic activities like exports,” he added.
 Dr Ishrat Hussain believes that social distancing is easy in the construction sector but it also means resuming activities in at least 41 sectors like cement and steel. He agreed that to bring labourers, they also have to relax public or private transport.
 Thus, I will go for selected and targeted lockdown as complete lockdown could have far reaching adverse impact on our already fragile economy.
 “I go for complete lockdown at least for one more week as the peak is yet to come and we still do not have enough testing kits nor ventilators and any large scale outbreak would be difficult to tackle with,” Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said while talking to some TV anchors and a group of senior journalists at the CM House Thursday.
 He also cautioned the prime minister to evolve a better mechanism for distribution of Rs12,000 each to the poor under Ehsaas Relief Package, as what happened Thursday in some cities where hundreds of people had gathered and could have caused ‘virus’ in many people.
 “I am not against the relief programme but we have to set priorities whether we want to save people from virus first,” he added.
 However, Prime Minister Imran Khan is still not fully convinced with complete lockdown theory and in the last two weeks has taken some more popular decisions like the ‘amnesty scheme’ for the construction sector and record Rs140 billion relief package under ‘Ehsaas Relief Programme’, with cash distribution of Rs 12,000 each to the poor registered for four months.
 Federal government has already relaxed restrictions on international flights but only to bring Pakistanis from different countries and also allowed foreign nationals to leave.
 When the National Coordination Committee met on April 1, and decided for countrywide ‘lockdown’ and to raise the capacity of testing kits, it has yet to reach its target till now although NDMA, confident that it would meet the requirement soon.
 Situation in Punjab deteriorated after Tablighi Jamaat Ijtima, like what happened in case of Sindh, when the first batch of ‘Zaireen’ from Qum arrived through Taftan border. However, the religious scholars and ulema played a positive role in convincing people to say their Friday prayers at home.
 The real test for the federal and provincial governments would be during Ramazan, which will start from April 25, if not 24th, and also at the time of Eid, the biggest ever festivity for Muslims around the world.
 Markets, shopping plazas may lose billions of rupees only in Ramazan, if situation did not improve and shops, markets remain closed.
 “I know that lockdown city like Karachi means lockdown economic hub but do we have an alternate,” Murad Ali Shah said, adding that if we lockdown till the beginning of Ramazan in an effective manner we will be able to allow economic activity during the holy month.
 Thus, the plea of Sindh chief minister to continue with ‘lockdown’ at least till peak is over, meaning by the end of this month makes some sense.
 It is a test for both Centre and the provinces and any decision should be taken keeping the possible consequences as a result of possible outbreak of virus as well as country’s economy, which is in ‘ICU’ if not on ventilator’ for some time.

I'm going to have to circle back with you on the exact numbers of our trainees that will be headed to Space Force.  As you may or may not be tracking, we have not separated pipelines yet.  We're working with Gen. Raymond to do this on a deliberate basis, and are, you know, in discussions with how he wants to proceed forward.  You know, we're pre-decisional on whether he decides they will stay with Air Force basic training or they'll develop their own and be in a different location, or maybe they'll be at the same base, but a different wing.  Those are conversations that are ongoing.  But for right now, those that have been or will be identified as Space are continuing just like all of the airmen that I've been addressing so far in BMT go.  So we're kind of pre- decisional on the breakout, and for the specifics AFSCs that we have in the pipeline right now identified for space, I don't have them.  I'll have to have our PA folks circle back with you on that.

ISLAMABAD: Chairman Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Bilawal Bhutto Zardari Friday said constitution was the soul of a state and tearing it means tearing apart the state itself and ridiculing it means ridiculing the people and those who tore up the Constitution must be brought to Justice.
 "Constitution is a sacrosanct social contract between the state and citizens on the one hand and the glue that binds the federating units together on the other. Abrogating it means dismembering the federation and alienating the citizen from the state," he said on the Constitution Day on Friday.
 The Constitution of Pakistan 1973 was adopted by the National Assembly on April 10 in 1973.
 Bilawal also called for punishing those "treasonous elements who abrogated and subverted this foundational document of the state for personal power and ambitions.
 "It is a national disgrace that a dictator abrogated the Constitution in 1977 later ridiculing it as 'a mere 15-page document' that he boasted could be torn at will," he said.
 He said those who tore and ridiculed the Constitution were traitors and dictators and usurpers must be punished; they will be in the fullness of time.
 "A dictator who tore up the Constitution and is on the run must be brought back to face the law," he said. This day reminds us of the importance of jealously safeguarding the Constitution and relentlessly pursuing those who have subverted it, he added.
 He paid glowing tribute to Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for "forging historic consensus among all the provinces, political parties and shades of opinion" in making the Constitution.

“I came back from Spain on Friday the 13th of March and Thursday, the 12th, was when I started to lose my taste and smell,” Wiese said. “I also just randomly got a cold and all of February I had a cold on and off and I was aware that having a cold was one of the main symptoms at the time of the virus. But I didn’t want to jump to any conclusions.”
 Spain has been one of the hardest-hit countries. As of Wednesday, it had 140,510 confirmed cases and 13,798 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.
 Wiese started to ask the training staff on her Spanish team if tests were available, but says she was told getting one wouldn’t be possible. That’s when the former Pinnacle High School standout decided to return to Phoenix, where her parents still live.
 It was in her hometown she took the test, which came back positive.
 “When I got back we were being cautious to begin with,” Wiese said. “My mom has plenty of Clorox wipes in the household. She was making sure to clean surfaces. We were washing our hands, non stop. I haven’t even hugged them yet since getting back from Spain. Like we haven’t, we’ve really tried to be mindful.
 “Then once I got the test results we amped it up a little bit more, even with cleaning and different precautionary measures, but now it’s more so just asking them how they’re feeling every day, making sure that they’re good to go.”

The upcoming amendments in the SBP act also proposed abolishing the Monetary and Fiscal Coordination Board that was chaired by minister for finance with representation of different ministers and recently a number of meetings of this important forum got postponed on account of different reasons. Now the proposed amendments bill replaces 9B with meeting of board of directors for holding at least six meetings of the board in a year and as frequently as is necessary for the purpose of discharging its responsibilities under this act.
 Under the IMF program, the government has missed the deadline to table amendments bill into the SBP Act 1956 till March 31, 2020 before the parliament mainly because of COVID-19 virus and a lack of consensus among different stakeholders also caused a delay in finalizing the draft bill. The tenure of governor, deputy governor and non-executive members proposed to be increased from 3 to 5 years and shall be eligible for one re-appointment for another term of five years.
 Under the SBP’s upcoming draft amendment bill, it has been proposed to insert a new section as 9F into the SBP Act 1956 under the proposed draft amendment bill of SBP 2020 as an Executive Board shall be established which shall be responsible for the administration and management of the bank as well as the policy matters excluding those matters falling into the jurisdiction of monetary policy committee or the board of directors and it shall meet at least once in a week.
 The executive board shall consist of governor SBP and deputy governor SBP. The Executive Board shall adopt its own rules and procedures.
 The function of the board shall include formulation of exchange rate policy and regulatory framework applicable to regulated entities under this act and any other law administered by the bank.

Talking to Shahzeb Khanzada in Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath’, the SBP governor hoped that these actions would bring the recession level down.
 Saying the government’s priority is to kick start the process of development and to show stability in the job market the governor said that the current statistics for inflation suggest that the prices would come down in days to come.
 Claiming the reduction in prices in the last couple of months, he said that the central bank decides about interest rate cuts on the basis of level of inflation.
 He said that the capital was flying out of all the emerging market.
 Replying to a question about depleting foreign currency reserves the governor of the central bank agreed that the reserves have seen a fall but added that similar situation has been experienced by many other countries. He said the situation would’ve been worse had this virus affliction hit Pakistan a year ago.
 He claimed that Pakistan’s economic fundamentals were strengthening before the coronavirus arrival, all indicators were showing improvement, stock market activity was positive, exchange rate was coming down, and international investors were showing interest in Pakistan. He said that the fundamentals were still intact
 Our correspondent adds: Earlier, the SBP introduced a temporary refinance scheme for businesses entitled Refinance Scheme for Payment of Wages and Salaries to the Workers and Employees of Business Concerns with a view to support the employment of workers in the face of economic challenges posed by the spread of COVID-19. The core objective of this facility is to incentivise businesses to not lay off their workers during COVID-19 pandemic, says a press release of the State Bank of Pakistan issued here on Friday. The scheme will be available to all businesses in Pakistan through banks and will cover all types of employees including permanent, contractual, daily wages as well as outsourced workers. The scheme will provide financing for wages and salaries expense for three months from April to June 2020 for those businesses which do not lay off their employees for these three months.
 The mark-up on the loans under this scheme will be up to 5pc. Borrowers that are on the active taxpayers list, will be able to get loans at a further reduced mark-up rate of 4pc. The scheme has been designed to give preference to smaller businesses.
 Businesses with a three-month wage and salary expense of up to Rs200 million will be able to avail the full amount of their expense in financing while those with a three-month wage and salary expense of greater than Rs500 million will be able to avail up to 50pc of their expense. Businesses in the middle category will be able to avail up to 75 percent of their three months’ salary and wage expense.
 The banks will not charge any loan processing fee, credit limit fee or prepayment penalties for loans under this scheme. A grace period of six months will be allowed to the borrowers while the repayment of the principal amount will be made in two years. Banks will provide weekly reporting to the SBP on the take up of the scheme and in particular the reasons for any denials of financing requests under this scheme.

PESHAWAR: Even though the struggle to contain coronavirus needs unity, particularly in the ruling party, the differences among Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf (PTI) lawmakers were visible when Chief Minister Mahmood Khan visited Mardan on April 7 to take stock of the situation in the district most affected by the Covid-19 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Former senior minister Mohammad Atif Khan and MPAs Zahir Shah Toru, TufailAnjum and SajidaHanif were conspicuous by their absence during the events that the chief minister attended in Mardan. They reportedly weren't invited to any of these events. One of the MPAs said they were expecting an invitation but it didn't arrive. These four lawmakers from Mardan are seen to be in the anti-Mahmood Khan group in the PTI. However, the PK-49 Mardan MPA TufailAnjum said he was on good terms with all, including those considered close to the chief minister. It was the chief minister's first visit to Mardan after the formation of the PTI government in the province following the July 2018 general election. Though he had come specifically to review the coronavirus situation in Mardan, opposition members and some media persons in Mardan criticized him for not announcing any 'special development package' for the district. However, Mahmood Khan's supporters argued this wasn't the time to expect the chief minister to allocate special funds for a district when the priority is to tackle the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Atif Khan, along with provincial ministers Shahram Khan Tarakai and Shakil Ahmad, were summarily removed from the cabinet on disciplinary grounds in late January when Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is also chairman of the PTI, sided with Mahmood Khan in the tussle between the two groups. Though Atif Khan and ShahramTarakai were later invited by the prime minister for a meeting to listen to their version, the issue is still unresolved and it isn't known if and when the sacked ministers would be reinstated. With strong support from Imran Khan, Chief Minister Mahmood Khan is taking his time to decide the return of the axed ministers. The other four PTI MPAs from Mardan including IftikharMashwani, Amir Farzand, Abdul Salam Afridi and Malik Shaukatstood by the chief minister and are in his good books. The differences in the PTI in Mardan, the second biggest district in KP after Peshawar, were also evident during a recent teleconference that was hosted by the party's lawmaker Zahir Shah Toru and organized and chaired by Atif Khan. Though Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan, KP Health Minister TaimurSaleemJhagra and Mardan MNA Mujahid Khan, all belonging to the PTI, attended the teleconference, the four party MPAs opposed to Atif Khan didn't attend the event. The PTI is clearly divided into two camps in Mardan, causing pain to party activists. They want the PTI leadership to take steps to resolve the differences as inaction was widening the gulf between the two sides. Though sources close to Atif Khan said he has met the prime minister again, the latter obviously has to focus first on containing the coronavirus pandemic and reviving Pakistan'sbattered economy and saving livelihoods.

LONDON: The COVID-19 pandemic is causing an "unprecedented crisis" for some European criminal justice systems as officials try to deal with a host of unforeseen problems.
 Courts, lawyers and prison officials from Belfast to Warsaw are trying to adapt systems that protect society but are cracking under the strain of the new coronavirus.
 Many countries have taken similar approaches to deal with the crisis.
 Austria, Britain, Germany and Poland are among those that have postponed trials, with London halting new jury cases because of social distancing restrictions.
 "The COVID-19 outbreak presents an unprecedented crisis for the criminal justice system in the UK," said a National Police Chiefs´ Council document published on April 2 that outlined new guidance for officers.
 "It follows that there must be careful consideration of what new offences are fed into the system," it added.
 Northern Ireland has agreed the temporary release of 200 prisoners from jail because of the crisis.
 In Poland -- where the right-wing Law and Justice Party has introduced a slew of controversial judicial reforms since 2015 -- most prisoners serving terms of less than three years have been released. Portugal has granted pardons on humanitarian grounds.
 In Austria, prisoners denied visits are allowed longer phone and video calls.
 "The ban on visitors led to some tensions among the prisoners. So now we allow them to talk more on the phone," Peter Bevc, a prison director in Klagenfurt, Austria, said last week. Scotland, which has its own legal system, announced -- and then dropped following an outcry -- plans to suspend jury trials for up to 18 months.
 The Law Society of Scotland described the call for a suspension of juries one of "the most dramatic changes to the legal system ever considered". And Guido Wolf, a justice minister in Germany´s Baden-Wuerttemberg state, said hearings had been postponed. "Our business will be severely restricted, but it will not be discontinued."
 Although human rights groups and others have noted the logic of such moves to prevent further spreading of the virus, they also warn authorities against disproportionate actions. Penal Reform International said officials "must ensure human rights are respected" for those in prison.
 "In such anxious times it is even more pertinent that people are not cut off from the outside world, they do not end up in solitary confinement, and most of all they have access to information and adequate healthcare provision," it said. Amnesty International highlighted concerns over Turkey´s plan to release some prisoners, but not some human rights activists.
 Problems appear particularly exacerbated in English and Welsh courts, as prisons and lawyers try to tackle a growing case backlog after years of government austerity, experts said.
 Bill Waddington, chair of the Criminal Law Solicitors Association, said the system in Britain was "creaking" before the crisis.
 "The criminal justice system and those working in it have been incredibly starved of proper funding for many years and lawyers have been warning government that even before COVID the system was on the verge of collapse," he told AFP. Justice ministry figures released last month showed that by late 2019, there were 37,434 cases waiting to be heard at English and Welsh crown courts, a two-year high and a 13-percent increase from the previous year. Police in England and Wales have said serious crime organisations and fraudsters should not be charged during the pandemic to avoid "clogging up" courts -- as they have been labelled "lower priority".
 Similar cases include criminal damages, common assault and low-level traffic offences, according to the April 2 guidance.
 Even those charged with domestic abuse should be released on bail for extended periods, it said.
 On March 6, Refuge, the largest domestic abuse charity, reported a 120-percent increase in calls to its helpline.
 Meanwhile, The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, has warned that some smaller legal firms could go out of business as court cases dwindle. Waddington said it was inevitable. "Solicitors and barristers who rely on legal aid work are working in businesses that simply will not survive the downturn," he said.
 "This was happening before COVID anyway but will certainly accelerate in the next few months."

When we set out to create a new e-commerce-based healthcare platform, one that would leverage the vast reach of the internet and mobile apps, to offer information, consultations and medicine to even the most remote and rural regions, we knew we would be providing a much needed practical convenience.
 But I don’t think any of us could have envisioned that ‘e-pharma’ would emerge as one of the country’s most important, critical and dependable lifelines in the battle against Covid-19.
 The lockdown, although unquestionably the right move by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, still came as a shock as it represented a major disruption in lifestyle and work routine.
 But to the millions of Indians already involved in battling chronic disease, the lockdown meant far more than just a disruption. It represented a challenge to not only avoid contracting the virus, but to also maintain one’s general good health by continuing regular consumption of prescribed medication.
 The comfort such patients got from knowing that Netmeds.com and other companies like 1MG, Pharmeasy and Medlife are up and running, and delivering medicine has been, I believe, not only beneficial to people’s health, but also provided an element of “peace of mind” in these pretty troubling times.
 The lockdown also came as a “gut punch” to businesses, but as we had been through a crisis-management exercise before, when the floods hit Chennai just months after we had opened for business, we had some experience with delivery breakdowns, and work-from-home (WFH) protocols. However, the fact remains that nothing was on the scale of a complete nationwide lockdown, so, like almost every business in the country, we too were scrambling for additional resources, like laptops and dongles.
 But the most important resource in the WFH scheme is the ‘human resource’ and that’s where I believe our team has really stepped up. Everyone in the enterprise is keenly aware that we are an essential service provider and each department has gone far beyond the call of duty to help our customers get their medicine orders, or connect with doctors for consultations. It takes an incredible level of commitment to sit at home alone — when you are used to being in an office surrounded by your colleagues — and be just as productive.
 In a business like ours, the important role played by delivery agents also came into focus. To grasp the enormity of what we were dealing with, picture this: On March 24, 2020, thousands and thousands of deliveries of much needed medicines that were packed and headed for destinations came to a screeching halt.
 It took concerted and round-the-clock efforts by regulators and stakeholders to get the deliveries rolling again. We’re now able to deliver to more than 14,000 pin codes and we’re adding more each day. Likewise, replenishing inventories; even much-in-demand items like hand-sanitisers and face masks are back in stock.
 As for medicine, it’s a good time to remind people who take medication regularly that if they run out of a particular brand, generics are a safe and effective alternative which most doctors will readily approve of.
 Finally, I am certain that there are better days ahead and though it will take considerable time before things get “back to normal”, they will. Everyone has learned some hard and valuable lessons about resilience and the strength of the human spirit, and very likely we have, once and for all, answered the question of whether there is a need for e-pharmacies.

PESHAWAR: A multi-party conference (MPC) on Friday accused the government of adopting a reactive approach while dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and demanded the joint session of the parliament to thrash out a strategy to fight the Covid-19 outbreak.
 The Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) had organised the MPC through a video link and its provincial head Sikandar Hayat Khan presided over the moot. Senator Maulana Ataur Rahman of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl, Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan of Jamaat-e-Islami, Amir Muqam of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, Humayun Khan and Faisal Karim Kundi of Pakistan People's Party, Arbab Tahir of Awami National Party, Dr Said Alam Mahsud of Ulasi Tehreek, Mukhtiar Bacha of National Party Pakhtunkhwa Wahdat, Shakil Wahidullah of Mazdoor Kisan Party and Akhunzada Haider Zaman of Awami Workers Party addressed the moot through the video link.
 QWP provincial General Secretary Hashim Babar, Senior Vice-Chairman Tariq Ahmad Khan, provincial Vice-Chairman Adnan Wazir were also present on the occasion. Welcoming the participants, Sikandar Sherpao said that the government should have built consensus to address this issue, however, there was no coordination among the centre and the provincial governments.
 He said the government was playing politics over this issue by creating the 'tiger force'. He demanded transparency in the distribution of the relief items by forming oversight committees at the district level. The QWP leader demanded the government to waive the utility bills and increase the amount from Rs3,000 to Rs15,000. Amir Muqam said the prime minister was not willing to take input from the opposition.
 He said the doctors and the paramedics, who were real heroes, were not being provided the personal protective equipment (PPEs) and thus were exposed to the coronavirus. The PML-N leader said the government should enhance the testing capacity to detect those suffering from coronavirus besides providing urgent relief to the daily wagers and labourers particularly those belonging to the far-flung areas.
 Arbab Tahir said the federal and provincial governments were not on the same page. He said the opposition parties were also not taken into confidence. He demanded the interest rate should be brought down to the single digit in addition to lowering the prices of the petroleum products in line with the falling international rates. The ANP leader demanded the federal government to provide the net hydel profit arrears to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to meet the shortage of funds while containing the spread of the Covid-19.
 Mukhtiar Bacha appreciated the role of the police in ensuring the lockdown and called for increasing the health budget. Said Alam Mahsud sought transparency in the distribution of the relief goods and the provision of the PPEs to the doctors and paramedics. He also sought the release of the prisons involved in petty crimes to address the issue of overcrowding at jails in a bid to slow the spread of the Covid-19.
 Mushtaq Ahmad said that the government wasted two months and did not take timely steps to secure the airports and borders. He said the government had enough time to arrange the PPEs and testing kits and establish the quarantine centres as per the SOPs. Demanding the government to tender an apology to the doctors, he condemned the baton-charge and arrest of doctors in Quetta. The JI leader said the government should conduct maximum tests to ensure the actual number of the patients. He said the provision of Rs3,000 per month to the affected families was not enough and the amount should be raised to Rs15,000 per month. He asked the government to fix the POL prices at 60 per litre to provide relief to the people. He asked the government to bring the interest rate to zero. Mushaq Ahmad also asked the government to take steps to ensure the release of Dr Aafia Sidique from the US prison. Maulana Ataur Rahman said the government should convene the joint sitting of the parliament by taking all the precautionary measures to devise a strategy to address this challenge facing the country. He said that linking the spread of the coronavirus cases to the members of the Tablighi Jamaat was condemnable and said that the government was using the opportunity to divide the national by indulging in such acts.
 The JUI-F leader said that the role of the parliament should not be ignored and a way out should be found to hold a joint session of the parliament as he believed the rulers did not have the vision and the ability to cope with the prevailing situation.
 He also demanded the release of the prisons involved in petty crimes and the missing persons on humanitarian basis. Humayun Khan said that the government should take steps to prevent the Afghan refugees from getting infected by launching an awareness campaign. He also demanded the government to conduct the screening of the patients and ensuring transparency in the distribution of the relief goods. Shakil Wahidullah, Akhunzada Haider Zaman, Faisal Karim Kundi also spoke on the occasion. At the end of the moot a joint declaration was also issued that incorporated input from all the parties. The participants also thanked the QWP for taking the initiative and holding the moot.

The workers live in dormitory-style housing, though, so Bevill’s main mission has been making sure they stay healthy. For example, only two men from the crew go grocery shopping for all of them.
 “As long as they are all healthy, there’s less of a concern. As long as they are not traveling around the community, which they don’t, then separation is less of an issue,” Bevill said. “We try to keep them isolated at their house, which is the dormitory.”
 There are still concerns about the health of local farm workers. Armando Elenes, secretary- treasurer for the United Farm Workers, called such dormitory- style living arrangements “a ticking time bomb” if one worker contracts the coronavirus.
 The union represents only a few workers at area wineries — such as Balletto Vineyards in Santa Rosa, Gallo of Sonoma and St. Supery Vineyards and Winery in Rutherford — and has found those businesses are adhering to proper safety measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 “We are not finding a problem with our union companies. Those guys are stepping up, especially in the North Coast,” Elenes said.
 Maintaining social distancing of at least 6 feet — a key tactic to curbing spread of COVID-19 — has been easier to manage for some agribusinesses. One would be local diaries, where workers typically live on the property and work can be done in split shifts.
 “All of our employees live here on the dairy. I think that is kind of a big help,” said Doug Beretta, operator of a family- owned organic dairy in Santa Rosa.
 While juggling the increased demands to protect their workers and keep the nation’s food supply chain functioning, farmers also are adapting to the changing demands of the retail marketplace during the pandemic.
 At the Petaluma Egg Farm operated by the Mahrt family, employees have been working overtime to keep pace with demand for more eggs. Some grocery stores have placed a purchase limit on them but more shoppers have been buying extra cartons to make baked goods during the county’s public health emergency stay- at-home order, which went into effect March 18 and runs through at least May 3. Residents have been baking at levels usually only seen the week before Thanksgiving.
 “People have bought a lot of eggs, so we have been working long days to try get as many eggs out. … We have only a limited amount of chickens,” Jonathan Mahrt said. “We are not carrying any inventory right now. We are selling everything we have every day.”
 At Liberty Ducks in Petaluma, however, the Reichert family had to scramble because 90% of the business before the coronavirus was sales to restaurants, said Jen Reichert, whose enterprise was started by her father, Jim.
 “By the third week of March, our sales dropped by 80%,” Reichert said, realizing her family “had to do something to weather the storm.”
 In the aftermath of restaurant closings, the family pivoted to consumer sales and delivery, plus launched a site to take online orders. Selling ducks directly to consumers was not a big challenge for Reichert, since she also has a wine label, Raft, that’s sold that way.
 For vegetable farmer Castañeda, he hopes to extend the growing season — weather permitting — as much as possible to bring in extra income. Last year, late spring rains and a mid- October frost shortened the season for produce.
 “We didn’t make pretty much anything with the produce business” last year, he said. “The only thing that saved us — we also have wine grapes.”
 His grape contracts with wineries are set for the 2020 harvest, offering reassurance amid the pandemic and the glut of grapes in the market as retail wine sales flatten.
 A 26-year-old father of three children, Castañeda said he shares the community’s concerns as the coronavirus outbreak spreads in Sonoma County. But he also knows farming is not a desk job, especially on a ranch where workers pick 18,000 pounds to 20,000 pounds of produce in a day.
 “I have to be out here working, so that way I can feed my family,” he said. “Us farmers have to keep feeding California now and the rest of the United States. We got to keep going.”

We...Posted by Chanda Allen on&nbsp;Thursday, April 9, 2020Allen says while the City of Lubbock continues its battle against the spread of COVID-19, her focus is fairly simple, directed toward one thing, the local economy.“Our small, non-essential businesses are shutting down and we’re just asking the mayor and the city council to please offer us some guidelines and we will happily comply, that way we can open our small businesses back up,” Allen said. “We are willing to have our employees wear masks, gloves, social distancing, a number of patrons per square foot, whatever it takes to be able to safely and responsibly open our businesses back up.”She says she feels like Hub City proprietors are ready for this next step.“We are just politely asking, no one’s rioting, none of our business owners are up in arms, but it’s been a couple of weeks now and we’ve abided by what has been asked of us and now we know enough about this virus and enough about the way that West Texas is taking it on that we’re not in New York, we’re not in Chicago and we can be smart, savvy and responsible business owners and still be allowed to open our doors,” Allen said.Which is what Lubbock Mayor Dan Pope says he wants to see, too.“I’m a small business person," Pope said. "Nobody wants our small businesses to be open and thriving more than I do.”He says that’s exactly why certain steps are already in motion.“We’re going to do all we can to get our small businesses open again. One is a formal effort, we’ll start talking next week about a recovery task force, or something along those lines.”Pope says while he understands Allen’s plea, along with so many other business owners, he says he’s looking at multiple angles in order to make the best decision possible.“I think that when we start to look at re-opening something, we have to re-look at the whole picture. I have a perspective on this because of what I hear from our public health folks, what I hear from the hospitals, what I hear from our emergency management people, what I hear from our business owners.”Pope says the goal will be to re-open businesses in a stair-stepped manner, in an effort to avoid a worst-case scenario, “The last thing we want to do is re-start and then have to stop again, close again.”So, with that in mind, Pope says he has one request for all Lubbock citizens: “If we execute our plan now, on this social distancing, this stay home piece, this gives us a better chance. Stay the course, ok. Let’s stay the course, let’s find a way to do things a little different for a bit longer.”Mayor Pope said he is looking forward to the guidelines from Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s office, sometime next week, which are set to provide guidelines for the re-opening of non- essential businesses.Copyright 2020 KCBD.

As thousands of North Bay families spend weeks at home confronting the challenges of a global pandemic and mounting financial and emotional stress, law enforcement officials and nonprofits that help children and adults escape abuse say they worry about a surge in domestic violence.
 They fear that statewide shelter-in-place orders, while necessary to combat the spread of the coronavirus, may isolate victims and contribute to a sense of helplessness as they’re forced to hunker down with their abusers without the reprieve of work or other daily tasks.
 “It’s a pressure cooker,” said Dina Polkinghorne, the executive director of Project Sanctuary, a Mendocino County nonprofit that runs two 24/7 crisis lines for domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. “If this is a household that already has tension but maybe hasn’t had physical violence ... it builds and builds and builds.”
 In Mendocino County, the impacts of the shelter in place order on families are apparent, Mendocino County Sheriff Matthew Kendall said.
 There were 10 more domestic violence reports, or a 25% increase, compared to March of last year, when deputies responded to 40 such cases. Child abuse cases saw an even sharper spike, Kendall said, increasing by 36% to 51 total cases in March compared to the same month in 2019.
 Assaults generally were on the rise, with the agency responding to a pair of shootings in which both victims lived together in the past two weeks alone. In a separate incident, deputies arrested a Willits man in late March on suspicion of killing his wife in a domestic violence-related altercation. He had previously been booked into the Mendocino County Jail on domestic violence-related charges on three separate occasions since June, Mendocino County Sheriff’s Cpt. Greg VanPatten said.
 The increase in violence comes even as the department saw about an 18% drop in total calls for service this past March compared to the year prior, Kendall said.
 “It’s been more violence than we’ve ever seen in March, as far as I can remember,” Kendall said, noting that calls for service historically to drop off in March, when cold inland temperatures keep people indoors and out of trouble. “What I attribute most of this to is stress. Stress causes a lot of different things in the family unit.”
 At Project Sanctuary, advocates who operate to the nonprofit’s two 24/7 crisis lines have also noticed in uptick in calls, which began about a week after Mendocino county health officials enacted shelter-in-place orders on March 18, Polkinghorne said.
 Many were from people who needed help with getting restraining orders from local judges, Polkinghorne said.
 To keep services running during the pandemic, the nonprofit has moved counseling services and legal advocacy work — such as applying for a restraining order — online. Its crisis hotlines, one for inland Mendocino County and the other for the coast, continue to operate around the clock and each has English and Spanish-speaking advocates available, Polkinghorne added.
 The nonprofit’s shelter, which has started screening new visitors for signs of the virus to ensure they don’t expose others to the illness, is also still running and the organization has acquired additional temporary housing for people fleeing abusers amid the pandemic.

After the cold and dreary months of winter, I am always eager for spring and to decorate for the Easter season. For me, celebrating Easter and the joys of spring go hand in hand.      Once you make the decision to set a formal or informal table, then the fun can begin. We've become a disposable society where paper plates, cups and napkins are the norm for family gatherings. Consider using the opportunity to take out the fine china, crystal and flatware. If you don't own fine china, but would like to start your own collection, visit estate sales or antique malls. While you're searching for these goodies, keep your eyes open for ceramic bunnies, chicks and lambs. Vintage tablecloths, napkins and candle holders are often found for great prices.      For a semi-formal place setting, I have often used wicker chargers. Dollar stores offer so many unique items to "fill in the gaps" on the table. Consider small vine bird's nests, tiny Easter eggs to fill small baskets at each place setting and holiday-themed salt and pepper shakers. Fresh flowers are always appropriate to herald the arrival of spring!      For fun and informal meals, vibrant Fiestaware plates always bring compliments from my guests. If you don't want to purchase an entire set of dishes, neighborhood yard sales and estate sales are your friends. The best part of using Fiestaware (besides its bright colors) is the ease of mixing and matching. I've used pink, purple, robin's egg blue, green, orange and yellow all together for an Easter egg color-themed table.      If room allows, have a separate "kids' table." Children love the bright colors and, again, the dollar stores are a treasure trove of goodies for setting the perfect table for your youngest guests. Vinyl tablecloths that can be easily cleaned are perfect for the inevitable spills and drips. Melamine plates are suitable for the kids, along with plastic cups or glasses. Consider filling a large basket with plastic Easter eggs as your centerpiece. If time allows before the meal, let the kids decorate their own boiled and dyed egg to use as their place setting marker.      Don't forget about the serving pieces. Silver trays, vintage egg plates for stuffed eggs, cabbage shaped bowls for coleslaw and platters with a carrot motif all contribute to the beauty of your Easter table. Plan ahead and visit your local hobby or department stores the days after Easter. You'll find great bargains for next spring's family table.

_Bruxelles, 11 apr 05:00 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- La Commissione europea ha approvato un regime di aiuti alla Grecia da 2 miliardi di euro per sostenere l'economia greca nel contesto dell'epidemia di coronavirus. Lo ha reso noto la Commissione europea che ha spiegato che il regime è stato approvato nell'ambito del quadro temporaneo per gli aiuti di Stato adottato dalla Commissione. La Grecia ha notificato alla Commissione una misura di sostegno nell'ambito del quadro temporaneo sotto forma di garanzie sui prestiti. La misura sarà attuata mediante l'emissione di garanzie da parte della Hellenic Development Bank (Hdb) agli intermediari finanziari. Il regime è aperto a tutte le imprese greche, ad eccezione degli intermediari finanziari, quali banche, imprese attive nel settore dell'acquacoltura, dell'agricoltura e in settori non ammissibili dal Fondo europeo di sviluppo regionale. Consente la concessione di garanzie sui prestiti per aiutare le imprese a coprire le esigenze immediate di capitale circolante. La Commissione ha riscontrato che la misura greca è in linea con le condizioni stabilite nel quadro temporaneo. In particolare, copre le garanzie su prestiti operativi con scadenza e dimensioni limitate. Limita inoltre il rischio assunto dallo Stato a un massimo dell'80 per cento. La Commissione ha concluso che la misura è necessaria, adeguata e proporzionata per porre rimedio a un grave turbamento dell'economia di uno Stato membro e su questa base l'ha approvata. (Beb)

PESHAWAR: Even though the struggle to contain coronavirus needs unity, particularly in the ruling party, the differences among Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf (PTI) lawmakers were visible when Chief Minister Mahmood Khan visited Mardan on April 7 to take stock of the situation in the district most affected by the Covid-19 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Former senior minister Mohammad Atif Khan and MPAs Zahir Shah Toru, TufailAnjum and SajidaHanif were conspicuous by their absence during the events that the chief minister attended in Mardan. They reportedly weren’t invited to any of these events. One of the MPAs said they were expecting an invitation but it didn’t arrive. These four lawmakers from Mardan are seen to be in the anti-Mahmood Khan group in the PTI. However, the PK-49 Mardan MPA TufailAnjum said he was on good terms with all, including those considered close to the chief minister. It was the chief minister’s first visit to Mardan after the formation of the PTI government in the province following the July 2018 general election. Though he had come specifically to review the coronavirus situation in Mardan, opposition members and some media persons in Mardan criticized him for not announcing any ‘special development package’ for the district. However, Mahmood Khan’s supporters argued this wasn’t the time to expect the chief minister to allocate special funds for a district when the priority is to tackle the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Atif Khan, along with provincial ministers Shahram Khan Tarakai and Shakil Ahmad, were summarily removed from the cabinet on disciplinary grounds in late January when Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is also chairman of the PTI, sided with Mahmood Khan in the tussle between the two groups. Though Atif Khan and ShahramTarakai were later invited by the prime minister for a meeting to listen to their version, the issue is still unresolved and it isn’t known if and when the sacked ministers would be reinstated.

 “It is a national disgrace that a dictator abrogated the Constitution in 1977 later ridiculing it as ‘a mere 15-page document’ that he boasted could be torn at will,” he said.
 He said those who tore and ridiculed the Constitution were traitors and dictators and usurpers must be punished; they will be in the fullness of time.

Neil Warnock is convinced of a swift resolution to the Emiliano Sala transfer saga after admitting mistakes have been made in the dispute between Cardiff and Nantes.
 Warnock was speaking after reports that Sala had signed a potentially invalid Cardiff contract in the days before he died in a plane crash in the English Channel on January 21.
 Sala was Cardiff’s record signing at £15million and the Premier League club and Nantes have been in dispute since the 28-year-old’s death.
 Nantes’ lawyers wrote to Cardiff on February 5 asking for the first of three annual payments for the player, as was agreed last month, to be paid within 10 working days.
 Cardiff have made it clear they want to wait until the investigation into the crash is complete and, with talks continuing behind the scenes, the two clubs agreed on Wednesday to extend the deadline on the first instalment of 6m euros (£5.27m) by one week to February 27.
 “I’ve got every confidence in Mehmet Dalman (Cardiff chairman) that it will come to a conclusion in the near future,” Warnock said ahead of the league visit of Watford on Friday.
 “They’ve asked for an extension and Nantes have agreed to that. Certain things were done in reflection that shouldn’t have been done, that stirred everybody up.
 “I’ve known Mehmet since I’ve been here and I’m sure the club will deal with it in the right way in the next few days.”
 Warnock also denied there was a conflict of interest in his relationship with his son James, who works as an agent for Unique Sports Management.
 The relationship between the Warnocks has been under media scrunity as USM have Cardiff players Sean Morrison and Rhys Healey on their books.
 “I feel sorry for James,” Warnock said. “Morrison was mentioned, but we turned down £5-£6million from Sheffield Wednesday for him and thought it was a sensible thing to put him on a longer contract.
 “Young Rhys Healey was mentioned, an up-and-coming lad who I think has got a big future in the game.
 “All the other players mentioned were at the club before I came here.
 “They mentioned me signing (Wilfried) Zaha at Palace. I don’t think that was a bad signing for £6m when he’s worth about £60m now.”
 Cardiff return to Premier League action at home to Watford on Friday following a 13-day break.
 In that time Warnock and Cardiff chief executive Ken Choo have been to Argentina to attend Sala’s funeral.
 Cardiff would climb to 13th place by claiming a third successive top-flight win, something they have not managed since April 1961.
 “To get three wins on the trot in the Premier League for a club like Cardiff is nigh-on impossible,” Warnock said.
 “Watford are probably the best team in the league outside the top six.
 “They’re a strong physical side who have got good players and, although it was 3-2 down there, they beat us well.
 “But in adversity you tend to pull together and that’s been the situation here.
 “What’s happened has made us play more of a tempo. We’ve got good players, and it’s about believing in ourselves.”

It’s not uncommon for motorists who have picked up a parking ticket in downtown Santa Rosa to publicly declare that they’ll never come back until the city stops charging for spots on the street.
 Well, those drivers may soon have their way.
 Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Santa Rosa City Council on Tuesday is set to indefinitely waive fees at city parking meters, a move scheduled after three weeks of sheltering in place dried up the city’s parking revenue, down 95% since March 17, according to city data.
 Most downtown storefronts are closed, with restaurants and bars offering only pickup service.
 The city closed its five garages April 3 after usage dropped dramatically — and following a string of car break-ins in late March. It also has put parking enforcement on hold as part its suspension of nonessential service.
 “We’ve definitely seen a drop in demand for parking downtown, which is good under the circumstances in the sense that people are taking seriously the order to shelter in place,” said Kim Nadeau, the city parking manager.
 Fees at meters and lots would be waived starting Wednesday , and all fees at garages would be waived retroactive to April 1.
 The council also will consider a new program to offer employees who work evenings at downtown businesses a steeply discounted garage parking permit for $10 per month. The permit concept arose from conversations between city staff and downtown merchants, many of whom have been critical of Santa Rosa’s parking strategies. Though the new permit program won’t be useful until the city reopens its garages, the city doesn’t want to abandon the plan, Nadeau said.
 “We’re going ahead with the agenda item,” she said, “because at some point, we’re going to go back to work, and things will start to return to normal.”
 That can’t come soon enough for proprietors like Matthew Vella, owner of Third Street Aleworks. Vella furloughed his employees last month and has been selling produce boxes with a business partner, with plans to bring in a mobile beer canner and start selling a lager called H.O.P.E. (Help Our People Eat). Proceeds will go to out-of-work employees.
 Despite the sheltering, parking is “in some regards worse now,” Vella said. “Now that they closed the garages, everyone’s parking at the meters.”
 Coupled with no enforcement, prime spots along Third Street near his brewery are quickly snatched up, interfering with Vella’s makeshift curbside operations.
 Vella said he was hopeful that the city’s new parking program for evening employees would alleviate the stress of parking, once the stay-at-home order is lifted. He noted that $10 per month is nothing compared to what a downtown worker would pay for a metered spot — even after the city stopped charging after 6 p.m. on prime downtown blocks last year. Increased garage use could translate into more open spaces on the street for customers, he said.
 “It’s a killer deal,” he said. “It would be a huge help.”
 But it’s unlikely all those parking meters have seen their last coins.
 Moving to a free parking system downtown on a permanent basis would require the city to find a new source of revenue, Nadeau said, because money from meters pays for the upkeep of the city’s parking garages.
 “I don’t know what’s going to happen down the road,” she said. “But I do now that as things start to return to normal, a managed parking system is the way to improve accessibility for those highly desirable parking spaces.”

Instantly smitten Joe Manganiello followed Sofia Vergara around like a puppy after meeting her for the first time at a party.
 The two stars tied the knot in 2015 after dating for a year and a half, and he knew she was the one for him the first time he laid eyes on her at the 2014 White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington, D.C.
 "As we're walking around, who comes swooping down in front of us for about 100 yards is Sofia Vergara," the Magic Mike actor recalled during an interview on satellite radio SiriusXM's The Jess Cagle Show. "She was wearing this dress that looked great on her, and I just could not take my eyes off of her."
 Joe was the guest of entertainment reporter Jess at the dinner and he immediately shared his interest in Vergara with his friend.
 "Jess said, 'Oh, you like that?' I said, 'Yes, yes, I like that a lot!'" Manganiello recalled with a laugh, explaining he told Cagle to take him to every party the actress was headed to in the future. "So we just kind of followed her around."
 Joe managed to meet Sofia at the White House Correspondents Dinner and they exchanged pleasantries, before hooking up for a date around three weeks later, when she split up from then-fiance Nick Loeb in May 2014.
 He scored her number through her Modern Family co-star Jesse Tyler Ferguson and went the extra mile to take her out by visiting her in Louisiana, where she was filming her buddy cop movie Hot Pursuit, for their first date.
 "I said, 'I'm coming to New Orleans. If you're not available, I'm just gonna do some sightseeing, but I'm gonna be there and if you're free I can take you out.' She said, 'You're crazy.' I said, 'I'll see you next week'," he detailed. "And the rest is history."

MEMPHIS, Tenn.

COVID-19 may be a respiratory disease but it can do a number on patients with a weak heart.“When their lungs, which is the main target of the virus, become inflamed it puts more stress on the heart which can lead to other complications,” said Dr. Brain Borkowski with Sutherland Cardiology Clinic.Borkowski says patients with conditions such as high cholesterol, hypertension already have weakened immune systems putting them at a higher risk of death from COVID-19.But doctors are finding some healthy patients who contract COVID-19 suffer heart failure as well.It’s called a cytokine storm.“The virus causes the body to have a significant inflammatory response and the body really goes crazy and tries to attack the virus but instead it attacks the organs," said Borkowski.There’s a new effort underway studying the effect COVID-19 has on the heart. The American Heart Association is fast-tracking $2.5 million in grants to study the issue.“So that just speaks to the importance of how this affects our community and we expect to see these results really quick turnaround," said Libby Phillips with the American Heart Association.Copyright 2020 WMC.

ISLAMABAD: Contrary to the wishes of Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has proposed establishment of all-powerful new Executive Board into upcoming amendments in the SBP Act with the mandate to possess administrative and management powers, including formulation of exchange rate policy.
 The upcoming amendments in the SBP act also proposed abolishing the Monetary and Fiscal Coordination Board that was chaired by minister for finance with representation of different ministers and recently a number of meetings of this important forum got postponed on account of different reasons. Now the proposed amendments bill replaces 9B with meeting of board of directors for holding at least six meetings of the board in a year and as frequently as is necessary for the purpose of discharging its responsibilities under this act.
 Under the IMF program, the government has missed the deadline to table amendments bill into the SBP Act 1956 till March 31, 2020 before the parliament mainly because of COVID-19 virus and a lack of consensus among different stakeholders also caused a delay in finalizing the draft bill. The tenure of governor, deputy governor and non-executive members proposed to be increased from 3 to 5 years and shall be eligible for one re-appointment for another term of five years.
 Under the SBP's upcoming draft amendment bill, it has been proposed to insert a new section as 9F into the SBP Act 1956 under the proposed draft amendment bill of SBP 2020 as an Executive Board shall be established which shall be responsible for the administration and management of the bank as well as the policy matters excluding those matters falling into the jurisdiction of monetary policy committee or the board of directors and it shall meet at least once in a week.
 The executive board shall consist of governor SBP and deputy governor SBP. The Executive Board shall adopt its own rules and procedures.
 The function of the board shall include formulation of exchange rate policy and regulatory framework applicable to regulated entities under this act and any other law administered by the bank.

Comrade Arabambi Abayomi, Labour Party Chairman, Ogun state: ”To say the least, the lockdown as a result of the ravaging COVID19 pandemic is not convenient for any individual, group or community. However, it is a sacrifice we all have to make now to stop the transmission of the new virus in our society. The most hit by the lockdown order are the poor and the vulnerable. Majority of our population in Nigeria are on daily incomes. They go out in the morning, looking for whatever take home will be available to feed themselves and families, however little. This means if they don’t go out in a day, there will be nothing to feed on. The stimulus offered by the government, especially of Lagos and Ogun are grossly inadequate. Even their distributions have been marred with such inefficiency and corruption that the poor and vulnerable, who were supposed to be the targets of the government relief packages were not reached . Most of them were embittered and were poised to defy the lockdown order and start going out for their daily bread. The government needs to realise that when poverty closes the door against the people, hunger will open it. The government must be proactive in this respect if the lockdown is to yield the desired results.

They have just done a remarkable job taking those proper steps, and that has come with the guidance of our wonderful health department and Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital.”
 Public health measures are vital, Girdler added before asserting that officials must be careful not to create an economic catastrophe in the process. “While we need to protect our most vulnerable, we also at the same time need to be looking at ways of allowing millions of healthy Americans to pursue the American Dream.”
 Girdler said he’s confident the economy will bounce back, even if it occurs sequentially, and added that SPEDA is focused on working with community leaders to bring that about. As the current situation has been unfolding, the organization has been working behind the scenes with businesses as needed and distributing information as it comes.
 “The greatness of Somerset and Pulaski County is our people,” Girdler said. “While there’s no clear path right now to be able to restart this economy, it’s time we all start having those conversations and start looking at how that’s going to be done.…
 “I think the next three months will be more important than the last two months,” he added, “figuring out ways in which our community heals and how we pull together to become stronger than ever.”
 Another way SPEDA is helping is to release some money into the local economy through its mini-grant program — awarding four $2,500 grants to startup and/or expanding businesses. The awards are to be announced next Friday.

The Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) had organised the MPC through a video link and its provincial head Sikandar Hayat Khan presided over the moot. Senator Maulana Ataur Rahman of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl, Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan of Jamaat-e-Islami, Amir Muqam of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, Humayun Khan and Faisal Karim Kundi of Pakistan People’s Party, Arbab Tahir of Awami National Party, Dr Said Alam Mahsud of Ulasi Tehreek, Mukhtiar Bacha of National Party Pakhtunkhwa Wahdat, Shakil Wahidullah of Mazdoor Kisan Party and Akhunzada Haider Zaman of Awami Workers Party addressed the moot through the video link.
 QWP provincial General Secretary Hashim Babar, Senior Vice-Chairman Tariq Ahmad Khan, provincial Vice-Chairman Adnan Wazir were also present on the occasion. Welcoming the participants, Sikandar Sherpao said that the government should have built consensus to address this issue, however, there was no coordination among the centre and the provincial governments.
 He said the government was playing politics over this issue by creating the ‘tiger force’. He demanded transparency in the distribution of the relief items by forming oversight committees at the district level. The QWP leader demanded the government to waive the utility bills and increase the amount from Rs3,000 to Rs15,000. Amir Muqam said the prime minister was not willing to take input from the opposition.
 He said the doctors and the paramedics, who were real heroes, were not being provided the personal protective equipment (PPEs) and thus were exposed to the coronavirus. The PML-N leader said the government should enhance the testing capacity to detect those suffering from coronavirus besides providing urgent relief to the daily wagers and labourers particularly those belonging to the far-flung areas.
 Arbab Tahir said the federal and provincial governments were not on the same page. He said the opposition parties were also not taken into confidence. He demanded the interest rate should be brought down to the single digit in addition to lowering the prices of the petroleum products in line with the falling international rates. The ANP leader demanded the federal government to provide the net hydel profit arrears to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to meet the shortage of funds while containing the spread of the Covid-19.
 Mukhtiar Bacha appreciated the role of the police in ensuring the lockdown and called for increasing the health budget. Said Alam Mahsud sought transparency in the distribution of the relief goods and the provision of the PPEs to the doctors and paramedics. He also sought the release of the prisons involved in petty crimes to address the issue of overcrowding at jails in a bid to slow the spread of the Covid-19.
 Mushtaq Ahmad said that the government wasted two months and did not take timely steps to secure the airports and borders. He said the government had enough time to arrange the PPEs and testing kits and establish the quarantine centres as per the SOPs. Demanding the government to tender an apology to the doctors, he condemned the baton-charge and arrest of doctors in Quetta. The JI leader said the government should conduct maximum tests to ensure the actual number of the patients. He said the provision of Rs3,000 per month to the affected families was not enough and the amount should be raised to Rs15,000 per month. He asked the government to fix the POL prices at 60 per litre to provide relief to the people. He asked the government to bring the interest rate to zero. Mushaq Ahmad also asked the government to take steps to ensure the release of Dr Aafia Sidique from the US prison. Maulana Ataur Rahman said the government should convene the joint sitting of the parliament by taking all the precautionary measures to devise a strategy to address this challenge facing the country. He said that linking the spread of the coronavirus cases to the members of the Tablighi Jamaat was condemnable and said that the government was using the opportunity to divide the national by indulging in such acts.
 The JUI-F leader said that the role of the parliament should not be ignored and a way out should be found to hold a joint session of the parliament as he believed the rulers did not have the vision and the ability to cope with the prevailing situation.
 He also demanded the release of the prisons involved in petty crimes and the missing persons on humanitarian basis. Humayun Khan said that the government should take steps to prevent the Afghan refugees from getting infected by launching an awareness campaign. He also demanded the government to conduct the screening of the patients and ensuring transparency in the distribution of the relief goods. Shakil Wahidullah, Akhunzada Haider Zaman, Faisal Karim Kundi also spoke on the occasion. At the end of the moot a joint declaration was also issued that incorporated input from all the parties. The participants also thanked the QWP for taking the initiative and holding the moot.

ISLAMABAD: Welcoming Pakistan's donation of $3 million to the emergency fund for the Saarc nations to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the Saarc Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCI) President-designate Iftikhar Ali Malik Friday called for closer cooperation among the national health emergency agencies and a long-term economic recovery plan for the region.
 Talking to a traders delegation led by the internationally acclaimed SME expert Rehmat Ullah Javed here, Malik suggested that the Saarc should adopt a shared telemedicine framework to provide health care to remote areas," says a press release.
 He said this was good sign that all the SAARC countries were ready now to fight this lethal coronavirus outbreak collectively and he also appreciated Pakistan's suggestion to hold a Saarc health ministers video conference to enhance cooperation and proposed establishing a working group of national authorities to exchange information and data in real time.
 Sri Lanka reiterated the need to work together, create social awareness, and have one central depository to disseminate information.
 He said South Asians had long suffered from intraregional tariff and nontariff barriers that make it difficult to move goods and people across borders.
 "Home to one-fourth of the world's poorest people, the region has disproportionately high trade costs, poor logistics infrastructure, and inefficient trade facilitation.
 He said the promise of regional trade in South Asia estimates that the trade within the region could be worth $67 billion rather than its recent value of $23 billion.
 Iftikhar Malik said the region's countries now had an opportunity to come together to remove tariffs on medical devices, protective gear, disinfectants, and soap, and they have started to do so.
 "They must also act to avoid restrictive actions by importers and exporters that could reduce global supply and affect critical supply chains, especially tariffs on food and other necessities," he added.

ALEXANDRIA — The 2020 Elite 11 representative for Alexandria softball is senior second baseman Kirsten VanHorn, who brought leadership, defense and a powerful bat to a talented Tigers lineup.
 Last year, VanHorn hit .293 and clubbed five home runs with 24 RBI while posting a .902 fielding percentage. She was even better during the sectional, posting a .400 average with a double, home run, four RBI and seven runs scored. The Tigers recorded a 53-35 record during VanHorn’s three years with the team.
 VanHorn excelled at three sports during her time at Alexandria. She was part of the 2017 volleyball regional championship team and she scored 8.9 points, grabbed five rebounds per game and was a 36 percent 3-point shooter on the basketball team this season.

Emiliano Sala's death was caused by injuries to his head and trunk, it has been confirmed.
 Argentine striker Sala was on board a Piper Malibu aircraft that disappeared over the English Channel last month on its way from Nantes to Cardiff, after the 28-year-old had become the Premier League club's record signing.
 Last week, a body was recovered from the wreckage of the plane and subsequently identified as that of Sala. Pilot David Ibbotson, the only other person on board, is yet to be found.
 During Monday's hearing of the post-mortem examination, Dorset Coroner's Court concluded Sala's passing was caused by injuries to his head and trunk.

As the pandemic progresses, jigsaw puzzles have become a “must have” for people worldwide trying to stay sane. Today you can work jigsaw puzzles on your computer and mobile devices, but many of us like the physical puzzle. You set up a card table or clear off the dining room table, dump the box full of pieces, turn them all over so they are right-side up, find all the outside pieces and begin the process. I remember doing this with my grandma and grandpa, and now my mom has a jigsaw puzzle going almost all the time. She just finished one that was all white golf balls! Now that the demand is so high, Ravensburger, a German puzzle maker explains the process behind these 1,000 piece + time occupiers. If you are just getting started with jigsaw puzzles, you might want to start with a smaller number of pieces and an easy image, or you can throw caution to the wind and dive right in. Either way, puzzles are a good way to keep your brain active and to make the time go faster while you are stuck at home. GOOD LUCK!

ISLAMABAD: Contrary to the wishes of Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has proposed establishment of all-powerful new Executive Board into upcoming amendments in the SBP Act with the mandate to possess administrative and management powers, including formulation of exchange rate policy.
 The upcoming amendments in the SBP act also proposed abolishing the Monetary and Fiscal Coordination Board that was chaired by minister for finance with representation of different ministers and recently a number of meetings of this important forum got postponed on account of different reasons. Now the proposed amendments bill replaces 9B with meeting of board of directors for holding at least six meetings of the board in a year and as frequently as is necessary for the purpose of discharging its responsibilities under this act.
 Under the IMF program, the government has missed the deadline to table amendments bill into the SBP Act 1956 till March 31, 2020 before the parliament mainly because of COVID-19 virus and a lack of consensus among different stakeholders also caused a delay in finalizing the draft bill.
 The tenure of governor, deputy governor and non-executive members proposed to be increased from 3 to 5 years and shall be eligible for one re-appointment for another term of five years. Under the SBP's upcoming draft amendment bill, it has been proposed to insert a new section as 9F into the SBP Act 1956 under the proposed draft amendment bill of SBP 2020 as an Executive Board shall be established which shall be responsible for the administration and management of the bank as well as the policy matters excluding those matters falling into the jurisdiction of monetary policy committee or the board of directors and it shall meet at least once in a week. The executive board shall consist of governor SBP and deputy governor SBP. The Executive Board shall adopt its own rules and procedures.
 The function of the board shall include formulation of exchange rate policy and regulatory framework applicable to regulated entities under this act and any other law administered by the bank.

Editor: The mayor and City Council members need to put the well-being of the residents of this city first, over the visitors who support their businesses. The hotels and gas stations/mini marts used extensively by the visitors continue to cater to out-of-town individuals, non-stop. Large groups on boats launched by trucks with out-of-state plates and large groups of construction workers continue non stop while the local restaurant workers are unemployed and the rest of us are told to stay home. Maybe I should just “visit,” and then the city will put me first. The city may have dodged the virus bullet this time but only time will tell now. The residents of the city would have been a lot safer if we tried to control the influx of out of state people, most of which came from areas with high infection rates. If you want to represent and protect the residents who elected you, please close the launching ramps to all individuals who do not have a local Arizona ID and make non-essential businesses close as outlined by the state, not just the restaurants. If we take strong measures now like other states have, there will be plenty of time in the near future for all to enjoy Havasu. In the mean time you lost my vote.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) senior leader Jahangir Tareen, who is under fire over his alleged involvement in the sugar crisis, questioned the criteria behind the audit of his nine sugar mills and the selection process by the committee formed to probe the matter.
 The PTI leader said that he does not object to the audit of his sugar mills under the committee.
 "Will the commission discover the reality behind all the sugar mills in Pakistan after conducting an audit of the nine mills?" said the businessman.
 The PTI senior leader reportedly had a fallout with Prime Minister Imran Khan after a Federal Investigation Agency's report on the sugar crisis named him, along with Khusro Bakhtyar's brother, as persons who benefited the most from the episode. Following the investigation into the price hike that came under the premier's radar back in February, the report stirred up a storm for some top ministers and PTI leaders.
 Despite a heavy shuffling in the federal cabinet, including a change in portfolio of food security minister Khusro Bakhtyar, President Arif Alvi had said that the PTI government is not in troubled waters.
 The prime minister and the president both put their weight behind the detailed forensic report, with the former threatening strict action against profiteers.
 "I await the detailed forensic reports now by the high-powered commission, which will come out on 25 April, before taking action," the prime minister had said in a tweet.
 Tareen had responded to the revelations made in the report, saying he would challenge the committee investigating the sugar and wheat crises if it held him responsible.
 Tareen, PTI's former general secretary, said that out of the Rs3bn subsidy to the sugar mills, Rs2.5 billion were given when the PML-N was in power.
 In an earlier tweet, Tareen provided explanation on the crisis.

 In Poland — where the right-wing Law and Justice Party has introduced a slew of controversial judicial reforms since 2015 — most prisoners serving terms of less than three years have been released. Portugal has granted pardons on humanitarian grounds.
 In Austria, prisoners denied visits are allowed longer phone and video calls.
 “The ban on visitors led to some tensions among the prisoners. So now we allow them to talk more on the phone,” Peter Bevc, a prison director in Klagenfurt, Austria, said last week. Scotland, which has its own legal system, announced — and then dropped following an outcry — plans to suspend jury trials for up to 18 months.
 The Law Society of Scotland described the call for a suspension of juries one of “the most dramatic changes to the legal system ever considered”. And Guido Wolf, a justice minister in Germany´s Baden-Wuerttemberg state, said hearings had been postponed. “Our business will be severely restricted, but it will not be discontinued.”
 Although human rights groups and others have noted the logic of such moves to prevent further spreading of the virus, they also warn authorities against disproportionate actions. Penal Reform International said officials “must ensure human rights are respected” for those in prison.
 “In such anxious times it is even more pertinent that people are not cut off from the outside world, they do not end up in solitary confinement, and most of all they have access to information and adequate healthcare provision,” it said. Amnesty International highlighted concerns over Turkey´s plan to release some prisoners, but not some human rights activists.
 Problems appear particularly exacerbated in English and Welsh courts, as prisons and lawyers try to tackle a growing case backlog after years of government austerity, experts said.
 Bill Waddington, chair of the Criminal Law Solicitors Association, said the system in Britain was “creaking” before the crisis.
 “The criminal justice system and those working in it have been incredibly starved of proper funding for many years and lawyers have been warning government that even before COVID the system was on the verge of collapse,” he told AFP. Justice ministry figures released last month showed that by late 2019, there were 37,434 cases waiting to be heard at English and Welsh crown courts, a two-year high and a 13-percent increase from the previous year. Police in England and Wales have said serious crime organisations and fraudsters should not be charged during the pandemic to avoid “clogging up” courts — as they have been labelled “lower priority”.
 Similar cases include criminal damages, common assault and low-level traffic offences, according to the April 2 guidance.
 Even those charged with domestic abuse should be released on bail for extended periods, it said.
 On March 6, Refuge, the largest domestic abuse charity, reported a 120-percent increase in calls to its helpline.
 Meanwhile, The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, has warned that some smaller legal firms could go out of business as court cases dwindle. Waddington said it was inevitable. “Solicitors and barristers who rely on legal aid work are working in businesses that simply will not survive the downturn,” he said.
 “This was happening before COVID anyway but will certainly accelerate in the next few months.”
