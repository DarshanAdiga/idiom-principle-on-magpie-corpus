TOKYO -- The dollar slipped on Tuesday on signs tight funding conditions are easing slightly after the U.S. Federal Reserve pulled out all stops to supply much needed greenback liquidity.
 The Fed announced unlimited quantitative easing and programs to support credit markets on Monday in a drastic bid to backstop an economy reeling from emergency restrictions on commerce to fight the coronavirus.
 "We seem to have got out of a phase where everything from stocks to safe assets such as bonds and gold were sold," said Koichi Kobayashi, chief manager of forex at Mitsubishi Trust Bank.
 "The dollar funding conditions are easing slightly, compared with a week ago, though I wouldn't say things are normal. While the Fed is pumping dollars, we still need to wait and see if those money will flows to every corner of the economy."
 The dollar index lost about 0.5% to 101.64, slipping further from Friday's peak of 102.99, its highest level since January 2017.
 Against the yen, the dollar shed 1% to 110.19 yen, having hit a one-month high of 111.59 in the previous session.
 The euro gained 0.8% to $1.0810, bouncing back from a near three-year low of $1.0636 in the previous session.
 The British pound also rose 0.8% to $1.1650, up more than two cents from its 35-year low of $1.1413 set last week.
 The Fed, which has already expanded its balance sheet to a record level, undertook unprecedented measures to extend its "lender of last resort" power beyond Wall Street to Main Street and City Hall.
 It announced various programs including purchases of corporate bonds, guarantees for direct loans to companies and a plan to get credit to small and medium-sized business.
 The radical steps came after U.S. money markets seized up as a broad set of market participants, from big multinational carmakers to small shop owners, hoarded dollars fearing a slump in cashflow during lockdowns in their countries.
 While the Fed's move is likely to mitigate the blow for many companies in the long-run, investors remained on edge amid uncertainty about the extent of the pandemic.
 Coronavirus cases continued to rise exponentially in many countries, raising worries about the lack of hospital beds in some areas.
 Wall Street's slide deepened on Monday as the rapidly spreading coronavirus forced more U.S. states into lockdown while Washington's fiscal stimulus package remained stalled in the Senate.
 "The market is still nervous about possible moves to cash everything, including unwinding of existing derivative positions," said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale.
 The three-month dollar/yen currency basis swap spread, seen as the market premium demanded for swapping yen for dollar, stood at 0.80%, down from a peak of around 1.4% last week but still far above normal levels around 0.2-0.4%.
 Trading remained volatile, with the Australian dollar rising 1.8% to $0.5932, extending its recovery from a 17-year low of $0.5510 touched last week.
 The Mexican peso and the South African rand jumped more than 1% and many emerging market currencies gained too.

Jenkins said he expected his authority to keep the order in place would extend beyond April 3, if necessary. He said that if Abbott issues a statewide order, the number of deaths would be reduced from hundreds of thousands to mere thousands over a three month period, citing the model from a website called covidactnow.org. The model was created by a group software engineers — not public health experts or epidemiologists — who want political leaders to act quickly to stop the virus from spreading, but medical officials from the area have rallied around the model as credible and worthy of taking action on.
 Dallas County's order is intended to keep hospitals from exceeding their capacity of COVID-19 patients and to "minimize the catastrophic outcomes" seen in other countries, Jenkins said at a press conference Sunday.
 "We are headed to a point of no return if we continue to dawdle," he said. "This is larger than Dallas County, so I implore [Abbott] to reconsider" a statewide order.
 Jenkins' order allows for people to leave their homes for outdoor walks, getting necessary items like medicine and groceries, and to care for sick relatives, but otherwise must stay in their households. Businesses that do not provide essential services cannot continue to operate from their facilities, and instead employees must work from home, if possible.
 "All individuals currently living within Dallas County are ordered to shelter at their place of residence," the order reads. "For the purposes of this Order, residences include hotels, motels, shared rentals, and similar facilities. To the extent individuals are using shared or outdoor spaces, they must at all times as reasonably as possible maintain social distancing of at least six feet from any other person when they are outside their residence."
 Essential businesses, including hospitals, senior residential centers and childcare for those employees, may continue in-person operations. They are still required to keep six feet of distance among employees and with members of the public, if necessary. As Texans continue to clear grocery stores of hand sanitizer and food, Jenkins stressed that grocery stores will continue to be open and accessible.
 Dallas County is believed to have been the most affected area of the state for the coronavirus. Local health officials reported that 131 county residents have tested positive as of Sunday morning. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 30 cases there as of noon Sunday. Abbott said that the state's numbers do not include "presumed positive" cases as an explanation for why DSHS' daily figures of positive cases in Texas have consistently lagged other disclosures and reports.
 As the pandemic has continued to intensify, local officials have been calling on Abbott for a statewide shelter-in-place — which would extend beyond the executive order the governor issued Thursday. On Saturday, a group of officials from North Texas, including the mayors of Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington, sent a letter to Abbott requesting he "consider a mandatory shelter-in-place" across the state. A number of health care executives also signed onto the letter.
 On Sunday though, Abbott said "we need to see the level of effectiveness of [Thursday's] executive order, noting that what "may be right for places like the large urban areas may not be right at this particular point of time for the more than 200 counties that have zero cases of COVID-19."
 Two Dallas-area Democrats, state Reps. Victoria Neave and Chris Turner, praised Jenkins' move in statements Sunday after the news.
 Neave, who co-chairs the Dallas County delegation, called the order "our best bet to flatten the curve and manage the riding threat this disease presents to each and every person in our county."
 And Turner, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, said, "Jenkins' decisive leadership will save lives" and called on Abbott to reconsider his position on a statewide stay-at-home directive.
 “Texas hospital leaders have asked Governor Abbott for a statewide stay-at- home order, as have a bipartisan group of mayors," Turner said. "I hope Gov. Abbott will follow the advice of the health care experts who are on the front lines and enact such an order – until then, I am confident that local leaders in many Texas communities will continue making difficult but necessary decisions to protect public health, as Judge Jenkins did today.”

The magnitude and probable consequences of this gargantuan black swan event will be significant and numerous. Realizations, insights, revelations, probabilities, and forecasts keep coming to me as this all sinks in.
   
 Here is just some of what may lie ahead both in the near term, and more significantly in the long term. Each of these may well merit a future column. So, I am open to reader requests to expand on any of these going forward. Now that we -- all of a sudden -- have to look at and experience what to do with found time, I hope readers will react and request exposition on any of these possibilities.
   
 First, some context. As regular readers know, I named 2010-2020 the Transformation Decade on 1/1/10 and stated that one of the dynamics of this decade was the beginning collapse of legacy thinking. One view of COVID-19 is that it will speed up this collapse as we enter this new decade.
   
 In addition, I am embarking on a series of books about the 2020s, with the first called "The 2020s: the Most Disruptive Decade in History." It is already clear 75 days into the decade that this is true.
   
 Humans are adaptive
   
 As we all reconstruct our new day-to-day use of time, we will initially struggle to adapt, all the while questioning if it is all necessary. The longer we are in a world of self-isolation and social distancing, the more how we adapt will trigger large and deep changes in behavior.
   
 Will we all develop a deep need for socialization and if so, how long will it take to occur? How many of us will feel that craving and how many of us will be altered socially? Since hundreds of millions of us will be in lockdown, a number -- significant or small -- will develop new habits, interests, and a growing sense of our non-social sense of selves, and a certain percentage will evolve to a different relationship with society. How big, how many and how significant will these changes in sense of self and society become and how will they affect what we have collectively decided is reality? This will be a real example of my oft-stated premise that reality is transitory and not fixed.
   
 The Two Realities
   
 During the last 15 years I have always spoken about how the current iteration of humanity is unique in that we have two realities we have to manage, our physical reality and our screen reality. We now have entered a time when the screen reality is replacing our physical reality.
   
 How will this alter behavior long-term? Will the bandwidth be able to be ramped up to handle the new load? How much of what humanity does daily can be fully on-line? This may be a time we will look back upon as a tipping point of humanity moving ever more to the screen reality.
   
 Economics
   
 Recession and contraction of global GDP.
   
 In the first week of February and first week of March respectfully I forecast global financial contraction due to COVID-19. I now think they are conservative. Though I don't like to use Industrial Age terms such as GDP and Recession, it is clear that we will be in recession globally through at least June.
   
 Global GDP may shrink 5-10% compared to 2019.
   
 70% of the U.S. economy is consumer spending. Depending on the length of the lock-down, consumption will decline annually by at least 10-25%
   
 Massive debt default
   
 The Great Recession was triggered by real estate. The COVID-19 contraction may well be triggered by the massive amount of junk level corporate debt. Currently in the U.S. there is $16 billion of corporate debt - 75% of GDP -- much of which is junk level status. This is a record. Think about the collapse of revenue and thus profits going forward. Some corporations will not be able to pay on the debt, some companies will be able to but, with shrinking or collapsing revenue, post minimal if any profit.
   
 Under capitalized companies, mostly small and medium sized, will simply be declaring bankruptcy in the coming months.
   
 These realities will not be helped by the Federal Reserve Bank, which has lowered interest rates to unsuccessfully prop up markets. They have no more ammunition and still hold $trillions of debt from the Great Recession.
   
 Government and the Private Sector
   
 COVID-19 may well show the necessity of the private sector to step up and face the common good. Governmental leadership may be too slow, governments may be too indebted or dysfunctional to react to this crisis. Enter corporations and foundations to save the day.
   
 Demographics
   
 We know that it is the older, elderly people who are at the highest risk of dying due to COVID-19. This means that the first step after self-isolation is to have those under 50 flood back out into the marketplace. This demographic separation may have interesting long-term consequences.
   
 Climate Crisis
   
 This is a big one. Of course, for the first time in 5 years, GHG emissions may actually not increase year over year. They may in fact decline year over year. In addition, there will be a lot less consumption with the resultant lowering of waste.
   
 The pandemic has within it the chance to lower consumption as we all realize that impulse buying of stuff is less important than having a clutter free life of fewer things. Many will realize what is truly important and that less is more. Finally, the global experience of moving through COVID-19 collectively will increase the necessary Spaceship Earth consciousness that, collectively we can successfully face daunting realities.

HINGHAM - Kaya Bogle wasn't accustomed to losing during his Hingham High wrestling career. But it was a loss at the Division 2 state meet on Feb. 22 that propelled him to his biggest victory.
 Bogle was leading the 132-pound finals, 5-0, with less than one minute remaining when his opponent, North Andover's Ethan Ford, pinned him in a controversial decision. Throughout the next week, Bogle used the shocking defeat as motivation for the All-States.
 "I wore the anklet I had on [in the loss] all week to put that good energy and all the hard work into the anklet," he said.
 When he reached the finals of the All-State meet, waiting for him was none other than Ford. But this time, there would be no surprise as Bogle won an 11-7 decision.
 "He got the first takedown and I was little worried, but I ended up coming back," Bogle said.
 Bogle went on to finish fourth at the New England championships, despite battling through a jammed thumb and a turf toe injury.
 "I wrestled OK [at New Englands], but I was kind of beat up from the season," he said. "I was tired and my body was sore. I feel like I wasn't healed up to wrestle to my full potential. But fourth isn't that bad for New England's."
 Comebacks were a big part of Bogle's Hingham career, which saw him go 164-23, including 43-4 in his senior season, and advance three times to the New England championships. He was also named Patriot League MVP this season after leading the Harbormen to their eighth straight league title. Bogle will head to Div. 3 Castleton (Vermont) University next fall to continue his wrestling career.
 Hingham head coach Paul Canniff calls Bogle a "funky" wrestler, which in wrestling jargon means that he didn't wrestle strictly by the book and could surprise opponents at any moment, regardless of the circumstances.
 "He was very good at getting out of situations," Canniff said. "He could go from being in trouble to putting his opponent in trouble in a second."
 Bogle calls himself a "scramble wrestler".
 "I like to do rolls and flips," he explained. "There were times when I've been down big, like 14-0 with 15 seconds left, and I've caught my guy and pinned him. You never know what's going to happen. It's unpredictable."
 Wrestling might be unpredictable, but Bogle's matches this season were as predictable as death and taxes. Alternating between competing at 132 and 138 pounds, the Harbormen could count on him for six points, for a pin, in nearly every match.
 "It's been nice to know that every time over the past four years that's pretty much what he would give us," Canniff said.
 Canniff had been waiting a long time for Bogle to pull on a Hingham uniform. "We knew he was good about 10 years ago," he said.
 Bogle's father, Damien, is a long-time youth wrestling coach in town, and Kaya began wrestling at age 5. By middle school, he was taking the sport seriously.
 "That's when I turned the corner and started wrestling year-round, and when I started to grow as a wrestler, and realized it was something I was good at, something I liked, and something I wanted to keep doing," Bogle said.

The body does a pretty good job of protecting itself from invading viruses and bacteria. Antibodies are one of the main lines of defense, but when a new threat emerges it takes time for the body to produce new antibodies to fight it. A new study led by Berkeley Lab has designed an effective system that should speed up discovery of new artificial antibodies.
 Antibodies are proteins that have specialized tips that latch onto certain molecules in pathogens. When they do, they either flag the invader for destruction by other immune cells, or neutralize the pathogen directly by inhibiting a vital function. Each antibody is focused on one particular pathogen, and your body is teeming with different types of them, targeting all sorts of invaders.
 Since they’re so effective, scientists often harvest antibodies from people who have fought off certain illnesses, or engineer them from scratch, to help strengthen the immune systems of patients currently afflicted with that disease. Unfortunately, that’s a difficult and costly process.
 A more effective alternative may be artificial antibodies, and other nanoparticles that act in a similar way. In the new study, Berkeley Lab researchers managed to create a new system of screening artificial antibodies.
 The system starts with a nanosheet made up of molecules called peptoids. This is then coated in loops of other peptoids, which the team calls “loopoids.” The nanosheet provides the supporting structure, while the loopoids are the active parts, latching onto molecules that may be present in different pathogens.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The stands were packed, Jimmie Johnson caused several wrecks, Denny Hamlin raced barefoot and damaged cars were repaired with the push of a button -- a few virtual signs that NASCAR backed quite an unreal race.
   
 NASCAR eased off the brake in the real sports world brought to a sudden halt by the coronavirus and introduced the country to iRacing with some of the sports biggest stars. Hamlin, the three-time Daytona 500 winner, beat Dale Earnhardt Jr. off the final corner Sunday at virtual Homestead-Miami Speedway to win the bizarre spectacle.
   
 "For the community, the racing community, the NASCAR drivers to come together and put drivers on the racetrack with such short notice, everyone is buying up simulation rigs this week and last week getting ready for the event, and for it all to come together and have a great finish, I think it was definitely a success," Hamlin said.
   
 "iRacing got involved and emailed everyone, said, 'Hey, this is what we're thinking about.' NASCAR got involved, television got involved and said they'd be interested. But no one really talked to the drivers about unifying and participating. It was all free will, and that's what's exciting is you had full-time Cup guys out there willing to spend their time doing this."
   
 It was Hamlin's 31st victory in iRacing, which is where he was first discovered by Earnhardt long before he made it to NASCAR. Hamlin was heavily involved in putting together Sunday's pretend race, which was broadcast live on Fox Sports 1 and called by its regular team of Mike Joy and Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon.
   
 NASCAR has suspended racing until at least May 9, and with literally nothing else to do, series executives and iRacing put together the inaugural eNASCAR iRacing Pro Invitational Series in roughly one week. The first event was at Homestead, where NASCAR was supposed to be racing Sunday before COVID-19 brought sports to a halt.
   
 This was a one-of-a-kind competition for most watching at home, and ended up with a familiar winner.
   
 It could serve as a petri dish for other sports to try the whole gamer thing. The classic games aired across TV over the weekend will get old in a hurry, and networks are desperate for something fresh until sports resume.
   
 Drivers showed immediate interest -- even those with little to no simulator racing experience. Some rushed to purchase "rigs" to get into the 35-driver field, and the show-and-tell on social media of the setups provided an entertaining build-up to the event.
   
 Hamlin, racing barefoot on an elaborate rig in the living room of his North Carolina home, had said earlier this week he'd donate $5,000 to Miami families affected by COVID-19 if he won the race and Kevin Harvick said he'd match Hamlin's pledge. Hamlin also set odds for the race and was instrumental in a group chat among the participants.
   
 Truck Series driver Ty Majeski, ranked one of the best iRacers in the world, competed from a computer propped on a wooden desk with a steering wheel attached. Kyle Larson said he spent $6,800 building his rig, while many of the less heralded drivers who use iRacing to hone their skills can build a setup for a few hundred dollars. A competitor needs only a chair, computer, steering wheel and pedals, but NASCAR's superstars shelled out much more to trick out their simulators.
   
 Hamlin estimated his rig cost over $40,000 -- but defended the price because his simulator has motion features -- and said better equipment makes no difference. He also said he raced barefoot because "I like to feel the pedals."
   
 Seven-time NASCAR champion Johnson, who has been practicing sports car and IndyCar racing on the simulator in his garage, competed from a rig that appeared more suited for one of those cars than his virtual No. 48 Chevrolet. But Johnson proved to be a less-than-elite iRacer early with a comical crash in which his car appeared to be a ping-pong ball off the wall and several other cars.
   
 "I hope everyone enjoyed that today. I clearly have a ton to learn," Johnson said.
   
 Among those hit by Johnson was Alex Bowman, Johnson's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports and one of the highly rated computer racers. But drivers can hit a reset to "fix" the damage and continue.
   
 "No worries my virtual crew used a fast repair and it's good as new. Also I'm eating an uncrustable," Bowman tweeted after Johnson wrecked him. "And yeah I'm still tweeting and fake driving."
   
 Drivers took the event seriously, with most using the opportunity to showcase their sponsor -- Landon Cassill even signed a sponsor specifically for the event -- and fill fans hunger for racing. Many recruited their real spotters and crew chiefs to help. Bowman's real crew chief Greg Ives and spotter Kevin Hamlin both watched the event from home in team shirts giving Bowman advice.
   
 Many of the younger NASCAR drivers are world-ranked iRacers and use the game to work on their craft. The iRacing game is as close to reality as any professional sport can get because of the granular detail and precise rendering of each NASCAR track. The venues are laser-scanned to capture the bumps and imperfections in the asphalt, as well as duplicate the grandstands and billboards and pit lane.
   
 The race, called the Dixie Vodka 150, was 100 laps around the virtual 1.5-mile Homestead oval. Dixie Vodka said it would donate $10,000 to The NASCAR Foundation, which is centralizing charitable donations in the NASCAR industry to support those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 Professional iRacing drivers -- NASCAR hosts a league -- can create their own setups but for Sunday's event a fixed setup was installed.
   
 The event gave NASCAR a chance to showcase its esports offering on live television while also providing entertainment during a time when most of the world is locked down over fears of spreading the coronavirus.

 I am going to once again go over one of the most difficult challenges in today's investment climate: maintaining a reality check on your fears.
 Given the performance of the markets recently, it is no surprise that many investors have suddenly had to come to terms with the potential perils of investing and the unpredictability of market returns.
 It has been more than a month since the S&P; 500 has managed to rally on consecutive days. Still, there remains some evidence that markets continue to function, and if you can just hold in there then today's brutal dislocation will be tomorrow's opportunity.
 Say this for the Fed, they have not been afraid to act quickly. It seems that a new program or two is unveiled almost every day. They may be fighting the last war, but you cannot accuse them of not deploying heavy artillery.
 In truth, some of what we are seeing play out in recent days represents the hangover for a decade-plus of easy money. Nonetheless, there are reasons for optimism. It seems clear is that there are already some interesting opportunities for those prepared to take on a degree of liquidity risk. In addition, you need to be mentally prepared for some grim data to emerge in the coming weeks and months.
 Next week's jobless-claims number will likely chalk up a record high. Some of the quarterly GDP forecasts out there for Q2 are less than what we would hope for. In a sense it is war and the coronavirus as humanity's common enemy.
 It is likely that the financial markets will plateau before the economic data indicates a light at the end of the tunnel. Therefore, you need to be mentally and financially prepared for a lot of \"sticker shock\" data points over an indefinite period.
 Hopefully policymakers are making the right moves and thereby building a foundation for an eventual recovery. It's too soon to trade that view now, but by the same token it's probably too late to panic.
 Meanwhile, businesses are shuttering, and borders are locking up. The virus has the world on a virtual standstill. And a rapid decline in forecasts for the global economy and corporate earnings has broken the bull market for stocks and ushered in a bout of volatility not seen since the Great Depression.
 The S&P; 500 has moved an average 7.7% in the past seven sessions, and on Monday, the index saw its worst day in three decades. So, is any corporation doing well in this maelstrom?
 Walmart (WMT) appears better positioned than most to be able to cope with the coronavirus pandemic
 Anxious shoppers are hoarding everyday goods and non-essential stores are shuttered. The coronavirus pandemic presents a never-before-seen crisis for retailers. Yet, Walmart appears better prepared to deal with it than its peers.
 Hefty investment in e-commerce, health care and its 1.5-million strong workforce have the world's largest retailer poised to supply large swaths of the nation as governments and other businesses grapple to respond to the unprecedented threat.
 Rival Amazon.com stands to benefit as well, but Walmart can leverage its store network and clout with suppliers to gain a leg up.
 Even so, the challenge of stocking the nation amid a run on essential goods will be a stern test, even for an operation on Walmart's scale.
 Walmart prides itself on crisis management. After Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans, Walmart's truckers shuttled bottled water, diapers and socks to displaced residents -- often before the Federal Emergency Management Agency showed up.
 When the Great Recession crimped consumer spending, Walmart's low prices and wide assortment made it ideal for those trading down and cocooning at home.
 Note that Walmart can act only because of embracing radical change to its business model. These changes span across the company but are most evident in its market-leading online grocery business.
 Walmart has spent the past five years aggressively expanding that service, in part to provide a bulwark against Amazon's dominance of most other areas of online shopping. Now, that investment could pay off as coronavirus-conscious consumers, stuck at home, eschew brick-and-mortar stores for the web.

Now that the Star Wars sequel trilogy has concluded, fans are turning towards another exciting Lucasfilm property that they hope gets revived, with even star Kevin Pollak expressing interest in a return to the world of _Willow_. While the galaxy far, far away or the world of Indiana Jones might be the more well-known properties in the Lucasfilm stable, the Warwick Davis-starring fantasy film has earned an impressive following over the years, with Disney's acquisition of the studio and its debut of the Disney+ streaming platform sparking hope not just in the film's fans, but in its cast and crew, that new stories could be told in that magical world.
 "If I'm asked, yes, I'd love to do it," Pollak shared with _Forbes_. "It has to be considered a possibility simply because Ron Howard eventually tweeted that he was interested in seeing where Willow is at all these years later. It went from rumors to his showing some interest. I've not heard of any production, and I've not heard of any scripts being written. When Ron said that he wanted to pick up where all these years later with the same actor, Warwick Davis, as Willow, that was the first hint that the Brownies, Rick Overton and I, may also be invited back."
 Pollak played Rool in the original 1988 film, and while he confirms that he hasn't heard any updates that the project would definitely be happening, he expressed his enthusiasm at reuniting with the cast and crew for a serialized take on the subject.
 "I've not heard anything since. I would be 100% open to it, of course," the actor confessed. "It was an incredibly fun part to play. I'd love to do that again, absolutely."
 Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed last December that a script had been completed for a series, but even with that progress, even Davis himself is unaware when, or if, the project will officially move forward.
 "The internet has got a little bit ahead of us here," Davis shared with _Inverse_ in January. "There's a lot of work on development and working out what this potentially could be, but there's no definite green light, go, we're doing this. There's a lot of work going on. The right people have come together. There's a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of goodwill from the right people and also from the fans. I think that's what's really so heartwarming is the enthusiasm from people around the world. So, yeah, no definite news there. I think there's a firm chance that this is going to be something that becomes a reality. Definitely."

All these philosophies simmer as each season slowly burns toward excellent confrontations and reveals. And while the gorgeously stylish animation delivers bloody, bombastic fights against a hellish bestiary of horrific creature design, Castlevania treats its softer moments – two characters learning to trust one another – with the same deference and care as the grand, world-spanning plots like the extermination of the human race. And despite the grave overtones of a world circling the drain, Castlevania manages to subvert the doom and gloom by injecting genuine humor and dry wit in the most welcome and unexpected moments.

A. This is a tricky one because I guess at this stage we are in the acute crisis and everyone is trying to get a handle on what's going on but you are correct that at some point we want people to be able to function on a day-to- day basis. One thing we've been recommending is that people are deliberate and thoughtful about the way they are engaging with the social media and the news as the 24 hour news cycle is really quite exhausting for people's minds and we want to encourage them to have some time away and break from this for recharging. The way I talk about it with my patients is to think of going on a media diet rather than a food diet!, where you are selective about what you are exposing yourself to. Consider strategies like taking apps off your phone, changing notification settings and allocating a particular time of day to catch up with the news- for example look at news between 9-10am in the morning. Consider plugging in your phone out of your bedroom overnight so you're not tempted to look! The human mind certainly gets exhausted without a break from the online stress. So thanks for asking this question- we all need time for our minds to recuperate.

 FORT LAUDERDALE -- Steve LaTart in Minnesota is thinking of installing a space heater in his basement to recreate the atmosphere of his hot yoga classes now that his gym has closed due to coronavirus fears.
   
 LaTart's says it's part of the "new, weird, strange workout plan" he has devised during a nationwide trend of self-isolation and social distancing as the government recommends limiting gatherings to 10 or fewer people.
   
 Gyms, yoga studios and CrossFit centers around the country are fueling the drive to stay active by offering online classes, some free of charge, or extending trial periods for at-home workouts.
   
 Studio owners and fitness instructors are having to adjust too as they make the shift to teaching online. The Coalition of Health and Fitness Leaders, a group of fitness, nutrition and wellness industry representatives recently formed in response to the new coronavirus, hosted an online panel Thursday to provide guidance for instructors.
   
 Countless people around the country who have been cooped up inside as their companies mandate work-at-home policies and their fitness centers shut down are getting creative with their workout routines.
   
 Many are turning to online classes, grabbing bleach bottles as makeshift weights, or taking cues from YouTube challenges showing how to do crunches with furniture or turn a kitchen floor into a treadmill by soaping up the tiling.
   
 LaTart's yoga and warrior sculpting instructors at Life Time in Minneapolis are still teaching classes. They've just moved them from the gym to cyberspace, where they are livestreaming instructions from their website. LaTart says knowing he can still participate in the classes is keeping him sane.
   
 "I like the idea that this is something that's normal," the 38-year-old radio producer said. "This is someone I know. This is something that's familiar."
   
 Beth Berglin, 40, director of a charity in Miami, was used to going to boot camp-style classes four mornings a week until authorities began urging residents to avoid gatherings and she her husband decided to stay at home as much as possible. Her gym closed earlier this month, but she is staying active through online classes from Burn Boot Camp.
   
 "Part of the reason we exercise is to have that mental break," she said. "I can't imagine getting through this without having some form of physical activity."
   
 In Fort Lauderdale, LA Fitness members were told not to return as they left the gym last Monday night. That scene has played out across the country as state governments have ramped up containment measures. Planet Fitness, Equinox and Life Time Fitness have all said they're closing outlets for several weeks or indefinitely in response to the coronavirus.
   
 To make up for it, Planet Fitness started "Home Work-Ins," a series of free, 20-minute classes that don't require equipment. Erica Lugo, a trainer on the reality television show "The Biggest Loser," was scheduled to lead one of the workouts.
   
 National chain CorePower Yoga closed its 200 studios, but is offering online classes free until May 31. Taryn Toomey closed her New York studios, but is offering two weeks of free streaming as a public service, which she said has drawn participants from around the globe.
   
 "Lebanon, Germany, Spain, Italy. It's overwhelming," Toomey said.
   
 Fitness operations whose core business has always been online or home-based are also stepping up their game, using the opportunity to capture new clients. AloMoves, an online fitness service linked to the popular apparel line, has seen a 40% increase on its YouTube channel, where it is offering some free workouts.
   
 The at-home workout company obe has had 10 times the number of sign-ups this month compared to last, according to co-Founders Mark Mullett and Ashley Mills. They said the company also has received tons of requests from desperate parents now that schools are being canceled. Last week, obe launched four 10-minute dance and strength workouts for kids 10 and under.
   
 Peloton, a company that sells high-end stationary bicycles and treadmills featuring instructors who give live and videotaped classes, has extended its free trial period to 90 days.
   
 For most people, coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.
   
 Still, good diet and exercise can be crucial -- for the young and old alike -- to maintain sanity and keep the immune system strong against COVID-19. In addition to taking online courses, gym rats might now consider getting outdoors to exercise if they can, said Dr. Joe Khabbaza, a pulmonologist at Cleveland Clinic.
   
 "Simply walk outside in nature," Khabbaza said. "People can use this as an opportunity to exercise in other ways."
   
 Toomey encourages those filled with fear over the virus to use exercise as both a physical and spiritual balm. One of the best ways to fight the stagnation of home quarantine, she says, is to "continue to breathe and keep moving and use the medicine of that."

CARTHAGE — A non-clinical staff member at Carthage Area Hospital was diagnosed with the second confirmed case of COVID-19 in Jefferson County on Sunday morning.
 Hospital Chief Executive Officer Richard A. Duvall said the person, a county resident, is now in isolation and everyone at the hospital who came into direct contact with the person was put on quarantine for seven days, a step Mr. Duvall said was beyond the “appropriate policies and procedures” required by state protocols.
 “We decided to err on the side of extreme caution to make sure our staff and patients are safe. We knew this was going to happen eventually and we were as prepared as we could possibly be,” he said.
 Public Health representatives also notified the only two members of the public believed to have come into contact with the staff member of their potential exposure to the virus, Mr. Duvall said.
 Although Mr. Duvall emphasized the hospital and emergency room continue to be “open for business,” providing healthcare the community needs, they are continuing to monitor the situation.
 Also over the weekend, Oswego County confirmed its first two cases.
 Even with the addition of those three newly confirmed novel coronavirus cases in the north country, there has not yet been a sharp increase like those in urban areas around the state and country as a whole. At least not so far.
 Part of the reason for that discrepancy could also be the delay for test results, which averages to be about five days, and testing is just starting to ramp up in the north country.
 As Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo emphasized in his Monday morning press conference that more testing will lead to more positive results. But none of the tests that have come back so far in Lewis and St. Lawrence counties have been positive.
 Lewis County had conducted a total of 36 tests as of Monday morning, with 22 negative results. There are 24 people quarantined in the county and 14 individuals waiting for results.
 St. Lawrence County has tested about 195 people with 75 negative results and 120 results pending. As of Monday afternoon, there were 12 people under quarantine.
 On Sunday, a map presented during Gov. Cuomo’s press conference showed three new counties in the state with confirmed cases, and St. Lawrence County was one of those counties. But the St. Lawrence County Health Department, through its Facebook messenger, reported the map that displayed the county as having a positive case was incorrect.
 In Jefferson County, 204 people have been tested and quarantined with results pending, 46 of them being Fort Drum soldiers who had been deployed to South Korea.
 Sixty-one tests have come back negative in the county, according to Public Health Planner Stephen A. Jennings, in addition to the two confirmed cases.
 Of the 143 tests conducted as of Monday at 4:30 p.m. in Oswego County, 85 have been negative, two positive and 56 are awaiting results. According to the Public Health Department in that county, 70 people are in precautionary quarantine while six others are in mandatory quarantine.
 Those statistics, compared to urban areas near and far, are not increasing as dramatically or as quickly.
 The first case in Jefferson County was confirmed five days before the second. But Onondaga County, with Syracuse as its largest city, had its first case confirmed on March 16. Now a week later, there are about 50 people diagnosed with the disease.
 New York City has gone from its first confirmed case on March 1 to more than 12,000 people with confirmed diagnoses in just 23 days.
 COVID-19 is more prevalent in big cities with more dense populations, Mr. Jennings said.
 The north country is mostly rural and people are more isolated than in population centers across the country, he said, but area public health services are prepared for the increase of confirmed cases when it comes.
 Going forward, Jefferson County will join Lewis, St. Lawrence and Oswego counties in providing at least one daily testing update, Mr. Jennings said, and like the other counties, they will not report the location of those who are infected.
 “I actually want to share as much as we can, but with HIPAA (privacy laws) and patient protection, we can’t give too much,” Mr. Jennings said.
 According to Gov. Cuomo’s Monday press conference, confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state jumped to more than 20,000, which is up over 5,700 people from the previous day. There have been 157 deaths in the state thus far.
 No new cases were confirmed in the north country on Monday.

Some of the best performing cryptocurrencies of the day include Monero (XMR), Dash (DASH) and Ethereum Classic with 15%, 12% and 7.7% in intraday gains respectively. Ethereum price technical picture ETH/USD is trading at $136 while battling the key resistance at the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from $288.69 to a low of $90.00. The next hurdle at $140 has recently been tested and even broken when Ethereum price rose to a new weekly high at $154 on Friday. Therefore, there is a big chance that with the right volume, bulls could easily take down the resistance and stage another assault on $155 and $160 seller zones respectively. Meanwhile, the technical picture is relatively bullish on Tuesday as the Asian session grinds to a halt to usher in the European session. The RSI is above the oversold while its horizontal motion suggests that sideways trading could take over. A consolidation movement is also likely to allow the bulls to gather the strength to push the price towards the coveted $200 level. Besides, the Elliot Wave Oscillator is still recording an interrupted bullish session since March 17. As far as a reversal is concerned, Ethereum could seek support at $130, $120, $110 and $100.

To help prevent the spread of coronavirus, Disney parks have temporarily closed, forcing many to cancel their trips. For one woman, a cancelled trip to Disney World led her to recreate iconic rides from the Happiest Place on Earth in her home.
 According to _Insider_, Jess Siswick was inspired to create videos of popular Disney rides after her trip to Florida for a work conference and a Disney vacation was cancelled. She wondered how she could still be part of the work conference, and filmed herself with her feet on her suitcase outside her bedroom to represent getting on a plane and waiting at a gate. Then, she started creating videos in place of her cancelled trip to Disney.
 In her first Disney ride recreation video on Twitter, Siswick explores a DIY Magic Kingdom. The video begins with Siswick turning an Amazon Echo Dot into a MagicBand Card Reader. A drawing of a Mickey Mouse silhouette is taped over the Echo Dot, which turns blue when she "scans" the MagicBand, which allows visitors to enter parks and check in at FastPass+ entrances. Then she spins around in a rolling chair to recreate the Mad Tea Party ride, with the carousel version of the "Unbirthday Song" playing. After, Siswick moves a teddy bear along to the "it's a small world" song in front of a backdrop as the song plays. The video ends with Siswick on a rolling chair holding a crystal ball to DIY The Haunted Mansion Ride.

OGDENSBURG — City Manager Sarah Purdy has begun posting daily updates on the city’s response to COVID -19.
 “As our community adjusts to new patterns in our daily lives, the City wants to assure our residents that we are open for business even though the doors of City Hall are closed,” Ms. Purdy wrote in her first installment. “This is the first of what I hope will be daily updates Monday through Friday on our activities.”
 The update will be posted each day on the front page of Ogdensburg.org.
 The City Council meeting that was scheduled for Monday night was canceled because the solution the city could come up with for people to virtually attend the meeting did not allow for any interaction.
 A solution to that problem has been found, but getting it in place might take a while because so many other municipalities are seeking the same solution.
 “The vendor that we are probably going to go with is swamped,” Ms. Purdy said in an interview with the Times. “We are going to get it up and running as soon as we can.”
 Life in City Hall is focused on logistics, Ms. Purdy said. The business of government has to go on.
 “Not just in these times, but in any times people think, ‘Oh, you can get rid of the clerical staff first.’ No, you can’t, they’re about the last,” she said.
 In her update, Ms. Purdy explains how city residents can interact with her staff even if the doors to City Hall are locked.
 “Employees are still present 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. If you need to reach any of the City Hall departments, please call 315-393-6100 and listen to the directory of available options,” she wrote in the update. “If your call goes to voicemail please leave a message and we will call you back. As an alternative, you can go to the staff directory on the City’s website and click on the email box to leave an email message for any of us.”
 In addition to taking care of city business, Ms. Purdy’s office has contacted Claxton-Hepburn Medical Center with an offer of help.
 “Today our City reached out to Claxton-Hepburn Hospital to offer Lockwood Arena, which is currently closed, as additional space should the hospital need to reallocate its own space to accommodate more beds,” she wrote. “We also have offered to lend staff for background coordinating work if needed, and we are on standby prepared to help.”
 For those who have bills to pay with the city, online is the easiest way, Ms. Purdy said.
 Xpress-pay.com, which offers e-check, credit card and debit card options, is set up to take payments. To make a payment, visit the city website at Ogdensburg.org, and click on "Pay my Bill." There is a fee for the service.
 “It is not a fee the City charges,” Ms. Purdy said.
 Residents can also use the postal service to pay bills. The address is 330 Ford St.
 Ms. Purdy is also looking at the future.
 “What is the City of Ogdensburg government going to look like when we restart?” she said. “Clearly it’s not going to look the same and neither is our community. This is tough.”

Comparing the eco-credentials of electric cars and their gasoline-powered counterparts isn’t as simple as counting the carbon emissions coming (or not) from the tailpipe. New research is claiming to have settled the debate once and for all by taking all factors into account, including the production of, and electricity generation for, EVs and found that they are better for the climate in 95 percent of the world.
 While there is no debate that EVs pollute less once they are actually on the road, some argue that the CO2 generated during the manufacturing of EVs and in the generation of the electricity to charge them actually outweighs that produced by cars with internal combustion engines (ICEs). The thinking is that while renewables can play a part of the energy mix, EV owners still need to rely heavily on coal- and gas-fired power plants to keep their cars charged and running.
 The new research was carried out by scientists at the University of Exeter, University of Cambridge and University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, and found that while there are exceptions, electric vehicles are generally better for the climate in the vast majority of places.
 To arrive at these conclusions, the team separated the world into 59 regions as a way of categorizing their varying approaches to power generation and technology, while also taking into account the current and future emissions of different vehicle types, production chain emissions and waste processing. According to the analysis, in 53 of those regions, electric cars are responsible for lower emissions overall than gasoline-powered vehicles.
 This includes most of Europe and highly populous countries such as the US and China. The researchers calculated that the average lifetime emissions from electric cars are as much as 70 percent lower than ICE-powered cars in Sweden and France, where renewables and nuclear contribute much of the energy supply, and around 30 percent lower in the UK. They found exceptions in places like Poland, where coal is burned to produce most of the country’s electricity.
 As part of their study, the scientists also compared household heat pumps powered by electricity as opposed to heating systems powered by fossil fuels, and found that they too would produce lower carbon emissions in 95 percent of the world. Were they adopted around the world, the team calculates that by 2050 they could reduce global CO2 emissions by up to 0.8 gigatons a year, an amount equal to Germany’s annual emissions today.
 "Taking into account emissions from manufacturing and ongoing energy use, it’s clear that we should encourage the switch to electric cars and household heat pumps without any regrets," says lead author of the study, Dr Florian Knobloch, from the University of Nijmegen.
 The research was published in the journal _Nature Communications._

I am going to once again go over one of the most difficult challenges in today's investment climate: maintaining a reality check on your fears.
   
 Given the performance of the markets recently, it is no surprise that many investors have suddenly had to come to terms with the potential perils of investing and the unpredictability of market returns.
   
 It has been more than a month since the S&P; 500 has managed to rally on consecutive days. Still, there remains some evidence that markets continue to function, and if you can just hold in there then today's brutal dislocation will be tomorrow's opportunity.
   
 Say this for the Fed, they have not been afraid to act quickly. It seems that a new program or two is unveiled almost every day. They may be fighting the last war, but you cannot accuse them of not deploying heavy artillery.
   
 In truth, some of what we are seeing play out in recent days represents the hangover for a decade-plus of easy money. Nonetheless, there are reasons for optimism. It seems clear is that there are already some interesting opportunities for those prepared to take on a degree of liquidity risk. In addition, you need to be mentally prepared for some grim data to emerge in the coming weeks and months.
   
 Next week's jobless-claims number will likely chalk up a record high. Some of the quarterly GDP forecasts out there for Q2 are less than what we would hope for. In a sense it is war and the coronavirus as humanity's common enemy.
   
 It is likely that the financial markets will plateau before the economic data indicates a light at the end of the tunnel. Therefore, you need to be mentally and financially prepared for a lot of "sticker shock" data points over an indefinite period.
   
 Hopefully policymakers are making the right moves and thereby building a foundation for an eventual recovery. It's too soon to trade that view now, but by the same token it's probably too late to panic.
   
 Meanwhile, businesses are shuttering, and borders are locking up. The virus has the world on a virtual standstill. And a rapid decline in forecasts for the global economy and corporate earnings has broken the bull market for stocks and ushered in a bout of volatility not seen since the Great Depression.
   
 The S&P; 500 has moved an average 7.7% in the past seven sessions, and on Monday, the index saw its worst day in three decades. So, is any corporation doing well in this maelstrom?
   
 Walmart (WMT) appears better positioned than most to be able to cope with the coronavirus pandemic
   
 Anxious shoppers are hoarding everyday goods and non-essential stores are shuttered. The coronavirus pandemic presents a never-before-seen crisis for retailers. Yet, Walmart appears better prepared to deal with it than its peers.
   
 Hefty investment in e-commerce, health care and its 1.5-million strong workforce have the world's largest retailer poised to supply large swaths of the nation as governments and other businesses grapple to respond to the unprecedented threat.
   
 Rival Amazon.com stands to benefit as well, but Walmart can leverage its store network and clout with suppliers to gain a leg up.
   
 Even so, the challenge of stocking the nation amid a run on essential goods will be a stern test, even for an operation on Walmart's scale.
   
 Walmart prides itself on crisis management. After Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans, Walmart's truckers shuttled bottled water, diapers and socks to displaced residents -- often before the Federal Emergency Management Agency showed up.
   
 When the Great Recession crimped consumer spending, Walmart's low prices and wide assortment made it ideal for those trading down and cocooning at home.
   
 Note that Walmart can act only because of embracing radical change to its business model. These changes span across the company but are most evident in its market-leading online grocery business.
   
 Walmart has spent the past five years aggressively expanding that service, in part to provide a bulwark against Amazon's dominance of most other areas of online shopping. Now, that investment could pay off as coronavirus-conscious consumers, stuck at home, eschew brick-and-mortar stores for the web.

MASSENA — Classroom instruction has started again in the Massena Central School District, but not in the classrooms.
 Instead, in response to the coronavirus situation that has closed schools, teachers are teaching and students are learning from home.
 All 18 school districts across St. Lawrence County are beginning some form of online instruction today.
 “We want to provide as much of an education as we can. We know there’s a limitation to it,” Superintendent Patrick Brady told board of education members on Thursday.
 He said that during a March 14 meeting of regional superintendents, a decision was made to close their schools starting on March 16 as the virus continued to spread.
 “That decision was for March 16 to the 20th of April,” Mr. Brady said.
 He said the district was already ahead of the curve.
 “Our plan was, we were going to have a two-hour delay on Monday to begin this process with our staff,” he said.
 Mr. Brady said there was much work to do in the following days. Some staff members came in on March 15 to begin the process.
 “We have to come up with an instructional plan for all of our students,” he said.
 They also needed to arrange providing breakfast and lunch to students.
 “All of that planning started right away,” he said.
 Online instruction began Monday, as did the distribution of free breakfast and lunch to all children 18 and under from five locations — the Massena High School parking lot, Massena Community Center, Jefferson Elementary School parking lot, Ray Hurlbut Louisville Community Center and Norfolk Fire Station parking lot (state Highway 420/Furnace Drive).
 “We’re just going to have to see how that goes. One school in Franklin County started this week. They ran out for that day,” he said.
 In addition to providing a “grab and go” breakfast and lunch, Mr. Brady said they had to make arrangements for families to pick up Chromebooks, as well as allow students an opportunity to retrieve items from their lockers.
 “Several people have come in to hand out the Chromebooks,” he said.
 Also as part of the process, they worked with Slic and set up a Wi-Fi hot spot in the high school parking lot for students who did not have internet service at their homes.
 “Parents or students can drive up and they can get Wi-Fi and do their work, or do their work on Chromebooks and upload it when you get to the Wi-Fi,” Mr. Brady said.
 During their Thursday meeting, board members approved two resolutions related to the closing of schools.
 In one resolution, board members declared the COVID-19 virus as an emergency for the school district and noted that schools would be closed from March 16 to April 1, “pursuant to the Governors Order and the earlier County Executive Order.”
 “During the period of school closure for students, all District stakeholders shall establish plans to ensure the continuity of learning to the extent feasible and appropriate in accordance with consultation with the State Education Department, Department of Health and the Office of Children and Family Services consistent with Executive Order 202.4,” the resolution said.
 It also noted that the board might be required to amend the school calendar “to address these extraordinary circumstances and make up instructional days.”
 The second resolution authorized hourly employees to continue to be paid from March 16 to April 1, “provided such employees are available for work and report to work when directed to do so. This is meant to make such employees whole for missing work due to the school closure and shall be consistent with such employees’ regular compensation during normal school district operations.”
 Depending on how long schools were closed, the superintendent could extend the length of payment to reflect that extended closure.
