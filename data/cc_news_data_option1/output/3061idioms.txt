Things have become harder with the coronavirus lockdowns. Both ad money and donations that have kept us afloat for a while have dropped dramatically. We thought we could weather the storm, but the so-called "surge" or "2nd-wave" that mainstream media and Democrats are pushing has put our prospects in jeopardy.

Dr. Zev Zelenko told The War Room, "There are forces that confused the president, that vilified and fear-mongered hydroxychloroquine usage. And the reason why is the have in the pipeline remdesivir and vaccines that they want to push through. So, hydroxychloroquine stood in the way of trillions of dollars. So there are 150,000 dead Americans and many more people around the world simply are dead, because the world listen to the FDA, which I don't recommend by the way, are dead simply because of people like Dr. Fauci and the forces behind him… I think the president's instincts are greater than all of his advisors combined and I beg the president to please just follow your instincts.

These services are being launched in a smaller number of sites first so Suffolk Libraries can check how new safety procedures are working before making them available again in all libraries by the end of August.
 Reservations from the library catalogue were also made available again last week and due to its popularity the select and collect service will remain available for the foreseeable future.
 Krystal Vittles, Suffolk Libraries head of service delivery, said: “We’re very pleased with how reopening libraries has gone so far and are grateful to customers for their patience and support. It’s important that we get a balance between getting things back to normal and taking sensible steps to protect people’s health and wellbeing.”
 Suffolk Libraries intends to reintroduce browsing in libraries by the end of September with activities being introduced from November onwards. The aim is to also reintroduce normal library opening hours when and where possible over the coming months with the aim to get libraries back to their pre-lockdown opening hours by the end of the calendar year.
 From Saturday, August 8 it will also be a legal requirement for all visitors to a library to wear a face covering.
 Once customers enter the library to use a printer or computer, they will also be invited to take part in the test and trace process by leaving their name and contact details. Their details will only be used for test and trace purposes and staff will dispose of the information after 21 days.
 Saxmundham and Great Cornard libraries cannot reopen for the time being. Great Cornard is running a local delivery service for customers who are unable to get to another library with Saxmundham soon launching a similar service.

But an old union-busting tactic like warning that associating with a group pressing for institutional change and racial justice might send you down the road is the worst of looks. Is strong-arming a player for speaking out on something completely reasonable really going to help your program, or is it going to undermine you even with those players whose hearts aren’t with the unity movement – and give recruiting rivals more ammunition? Because it’s the kind of thing that gets around.
