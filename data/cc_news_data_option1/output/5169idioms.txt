The volume of distressed loans is expected to rise next year after the expiry of mortgage repayment holidays for households and relief measures for companies, which were introduced when economies went into lockdown.
 NPLs were 2.8per cent of loans at EU banks at the end of June, up 0.2 percentage points from the fourth quarter of 2019.
 The European Central Bank's head of banking supervision, Andrea Enria, has warned there could be a "huge wave" of unpaid loans that could top 1.4 trillion euros (US$1.7 trillion).
 "To do nothing would result in a credit crunch, which would mean businesses would fail even more so and jobs would be lost," EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness told reporters.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The Dutch government on Wednesday tightened even further the strict five-week coronavirus lockdown that went into force just a day earlier, amid a backlash over some large stores remaining open. Opposition lawmakers criticized lockdown rules that allowed stores to remain at least partially open if some of the products they sell are considered “essential\" such as food and sanitary products. Green Left party leader Jess Klaver tweeted that allowing large chains to stay open while small local stores are forced to shut their doors to rein in infections “is the exact opposite of the solidarity we so badly need during this lockdown.” The government moved swiftly to bring an end to an issue that threatened to undermine generally wide support for the lockdown. In a letter to parliament, the government said that only stores where sales of essential items such as food, non-prescription medicines, pet food and sanitary products amounted to more than 70% of their turnover would be allowed to remain open. One of the companies that had faced criticism for opening stores, Hema, said in a statement it would close all its shops on Thursday. A fixture in most Dutch towns and cities, Hema stores sell everything from food to clothing, stationery and kitchen equipment. “It is a shame that previously-made clear agreements that could have led to Hema contributing to the spreading of shop visits cannot be achieved,” the chain's CEO Tjeerd Jegen said. “At the same time, (these times) require flexibility and tolerance. That also applies to us. If that means we have to close our doors to ensure health, we will.” Schools closed Wednesday and streets in Dutch towns and cities were far less busy than in previous days and weeks when local authorities...

It happens to me in real time. On the new record, there’s a call called “Garbo’s”. I’m explaining to this woman who’s about 90 years old about how I bought my wife a HurryCane — I have no idea where this came from. I was in the middle of a skit looking to get a Brazilian blowjob and asking this woman if she would set this appointment up for me at this hair salon Garbo’s, and out of the blue I said to this woman that I bought my wife a HurryCane. And she goes, “Oh, I have one of those.” And I went on to explain to her that I bought it as a nice gesture for my wife, because I didn’t want to see her lose her balance. And I said my wife put it all together and then beat me unmerciful, almost to death, with this cane because she was insulted that I bought her a cane.

Sunday night’s first look at the Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving pairing was about everything the Brooklyn Nets could have hoped for.
 The All-NBA duo knocked down shots right out of the box, powering the Nets to a 26-point first-half lead, combining for 33 of Brooklyn’s 68 first-half points, and shooting 12-for-21 between the two of them.
 It also reinforced that things are going to be different for the rest of the roster, particularly players who have been in those leading roles on the offensive end at different times over the last few seasons.
 “It’s one of these things where it’s going to be the ebbs and the flows,” said Joe Harris. “Obviously, right now, those guys are our focal point offensively. That’s how we’re going to play our best basketball. That’s how we’re going to be most productive. And I think across the board, a lot of other guys are going to have to adapt. Some games, we’re probably going to get a lot of looks when guys are collapsing on them. Other games, maybe not so much. That’s sort of how it’s probably going to be.
 “But at the end of the day, for us to win and have the most success, our offense is going to go through those two guys, and then kind of go down from there. But that’s one of those things where my main assignment as an offensive player is just trying to get space for those guys, getting down to deep corners, cutting off the ball, making sure that I’m occupying guys on the weak side and allowing them more space to facilitate.”

It doesn’t matter how fired up you are about getting fit, if you’re not sure how to do it your motivation will soon wane. That’s why it pays to follow a proven plan because a good plan, created by an expert you trust, is basically like a roadmap to your goal. The reality is that if you want to make a significant difference to your health and fitness and you’re not following a plan then you’re going to struggle. That may sound harsh but I can’t think of a time when I’ve seen someone get great results without following a structured and progressive plan. To pick the right one, go for something with proof that it works, something that’s aimed at your ability level, and something that feels like it was made for you.

Southampton will make the short trip to London to take on Arsenal this evening, with the clubs in contrasting form.
 The Gunners come into the tie on the back of some shocking results, having lost six of their last eight in the Premier League, picking up just four points in that time.
 The Saints on the other hand are flying high. They currently occupy fourth in the table, and a win could see them join Tottenham and Liverpool on points in first (Should the draw against each other this evening).
 Obviously we can’t be allowing that to happen…
 While Arsenal are in terrible form, and we are suffering, that can surely only go on for so long.
 Pressure is definitely mounting on our manager, and the players must know that with the transfer window set to open in just over two weeks, some of them could well be replaced.
 This team needs to start fighting for one another, fighting against their disgraceful league position, or fighting for the manager and the club.
 I don’t personally care what it takes to get the team back on the winning side, be it personal or team goals, or fighting for various mixtures of the above, but we definitely need to see them battling for something.
 If Arteta doesn’t manage to motivate his team to break free from their form today, he could well be out of a job before Christmas, but I’m relying on the players to save him from that tonight.
 While anything less than a win will do little for our standing in the league, the players will need to be showing exactly why they deserve to be playing for Arsenal.
 I feel like our team will have to overcome their confidence issues this evening, and a 1-1 draw feels like it is on the cards, but if the Arsenal of recent weeks remains from the kick off, Southampton could well win this convincingly.
 Does the tide simply have to turn tonight? Or will this Southampton side be plunging a stake into the manager’s job security?
