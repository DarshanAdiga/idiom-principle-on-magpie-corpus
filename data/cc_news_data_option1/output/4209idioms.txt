Petty’s original plan was for 'Wildflowers' to be a 25-track double album, but Warner Bros. executive Lenny Waronker made it clear he thought that was far too long. Instead the record was cut back to 15 tracks, but just after Petty finished his 2017 Heartbreakers tour, he revealed to the _Los Angeles Times_ that he was going to hit his archive, tidy up the final songs that didn’t make the cut and put out the version of 'Wildflowers' he always wanted to.

In the same way, be totally productive when you are working. Avoid social media or texting breaks, for example. You’ll find that when you cut out the time-wasting distractions, you don’t need 8 hours a day dedicated to work to achieve the same productivity. Consider putting a sign on the door when you absolutely cannot be interrupted, but allowing your children to enter your workspace otherwise. With everyone working from home, children in the room during more casual meetings is not considered unprofessional — in fact it shows a more human side of you that many enjoy. Furthermore, it gives your children a chance to learn more about what you do, thereby better shaping their own career path. Parents with more demanding jobs can correlate schedules with the other parent to get longer uninterrupted stretches during critical times of the day. If both parents have demanding jobs, consider hiring help, such as a tutor or nanny. Set work hours and stick to them. Have a hard stop at the end of the day. Don’t be tempted to “just check your email one more time.” Even during office and school closures, see your work-life balance as just that — a scale with work on one side and family on the other. Keep them separate because if you put them both on one side, the whole device topples over.
