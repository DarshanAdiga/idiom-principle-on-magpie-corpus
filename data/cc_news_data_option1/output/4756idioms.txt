Latin Restaurant Weeks Comes to Miami
 The Houston-based initiative has made its way south with the first-ever Miami Latin Restaurant Weeks. Currently, 30 Miami-area restaurants have signed up to participate, in which each will offer a prix-fixe meal that can range from a smoothie and a sandwich to a multi-course dinner. The promotion, which runs through Friday, November 27, also brings awareness to the Miami Dolphins Food Relief Program, which has been delivering food to Miami residents in need of a meal. Latin Restaurant Weeks has also partnered with Woodford Reserve bourbon, and many participating restaurants are featuring Woodford cocktails. _For a complete list of restaurants participating in Miami Latin Restaurant Weeks, which runs through Friday, November 27, visitlatinrestaurantweeks.com._

White House chief of staff Mark Meadows has even floated the idea of a tradeoff in which Trump would sign the legislation containing the Democratic language in exchange for repealing so-called Section 230, a legal shield for social media outlets like Facebook that protects websites from liability for content posted on their sites. The New York Times first reported Meadows' attempt at deal making, which was confirmed by a Democratic aide who requested anonymity because the negotiations are occurring behind closed doors.

Coworking is a business administrations arrangement model that includes people working autonomously or cooperatively in shared office space. The proprietor of the space gives a workplace and, for the most part, office gear and comforts found in a run of the mill office. Coworking spaces are basically shared workspaces. They offer moderate office space for those hoping to get away from the separation of a home office or coffeehouse. These common workspaces offer a suite of office-like luxuries, for example, hot-work areas, private gathering rooms, kitchens, espresso and then some.

"I'm surprised it [the Wheatsheaf] is closing though.
 We asked Christine if she thought the new development had impacted on older shopping areas, such as the Wheatsheaf.
 She added: "It probably has. I think if you have places where you regularly visit, in the same area, you don't tend to go out of your way somewhere else, and that's the problem.

La piattaforma delle parti sociali e’ stata presentata a febbraio e “le rappresentanze sindacali hanno utilizzato tutti gli strumenti diplomatici a disposizione per evitare uno scontro”, spiega Emiliano Borciani della Fiom Cgil di Reggio Emilia. “Purtroppo – aggiunge – la nostra controparte non e’ stata in grado di andare oltre ad un secco no a tutte le nostre richieste”. Da allora, prosegue il sindacalista, “ci sono stati due incontri e sono passati nove mesi, ma nell’ultima occasione di confronto e’ arrivato l’ennesimo rifiuto a trattare”.

Never in the history of mankind has marijuana consumption been so widespread and mainstream as it is today. While cannabis was demonized until recently, we now have a trend of legalization almost everywhere in the world, especially in Western countries. Many benefits have been proven, and the harm is certainly less than with cigarette consumption. Precisely because of so much prevalence and growing legality, we all have at least one person in our environment who consumes weed on a daily basis. Such people are usually called stoner because they like to smoke weed and relax that way. If their birthday is coming up soon, you’re probably thinking about what would be best to buy them. First, various things related to their "hobby" come to mind and it's hard for you to decide what's best, especially if you don't share the same interests when it comes to cannabis. We will tell you that bong is the best choice. And what the reasons are why this is so, read below.

Only a few days until Thanksgiving and just a few weeks until Christmas. This last October, a lot of new products hit the market, not only for new lure patterns, but also updated electronics. This might mean that it will be easier to pick Christmas presents for your favorite fishermen.
 Pat Mayse water temps have lowered some, but for now until Thanksgiving, water color should stay about the same — which is good. At this time, there’s not much activity in the shallows, and maybe it’s just a little bit early. Some shad are beginning to move there, and this will bring more following fish after those early shad. These fish will be aggressive and will hit just about any bait in a shad pattern.
 Baits that will work for you are spinnerbaits, swim baits on a weighted hook rig, top waters and bladed jigs. You might also have a squarebill or a jerk bait tied on just in case. With our water temps and water color, I also have a go-to bait that I like and it’s called a Scrounger. If you’re not familiar with it, it’s a jig head with a clear rubber blade-type molded around the head of the jig. I rig it with a shad pattern swim bait. I like the one-quarter ounce head Scrounger and with the added weight of the swim bait, it’s really easy to cast a good distance. The rubberized blade gives off a tight wobble and vibration which is good with our lightly stained water at Mayse and most of our other area lakes. The bait was designed by Pro Angler Aaron Martins, and it’s like it was kept a secret for a long time. It’s very much like a bladed jig — you can cover more water faster.

And, also, you got to realize I'm a standup comedian, so I know when I got you on the ropes. If I got Larry on his heels, I noticed that he nods his head a lot and on the right side of his mouth, his lip goes up higher, like he's trying to... He's like, "Ah!" He's trying to hold it in. I go into standup mode, where I'm trying to make a snot bubble come out of his nose, do you know what I mean? Larry is trying to hold it in and I know I got him. So I just got to keep turning the screws a little bit more and I start going deeper on the improv, and that's when you start to get these genuine moments between the two characters. I'm going to actually come to set, I no longer go into JB mode, I just try to be Leon the whole time because then I'm always in character. And I will only reply with things that Leon would say and would think about.

The news guys are always in the moment because they got to report to you what's going on. But then the comedian takes what's going on, from them, and we reprocess it through our filtration system that's built into our bodies, our natural filtration system of being able to take drama, taking tragedy, taking anything you can think of, reprocessing it, not that we're not hurt by it, not that we're not affected by it, but find some way to give it back to you in a more manageable form. No matter what it is, you can go back as far as you want in history, we have taken ... You can go back into anything. Creation of man, you can take slavery, you can take anything, anything in this world that we have been through, and take it, reprocess it, and make light of it. But that's the only way some people can deal with it, is to make it funny. Believe me, I'm telling you, man, nobody knows anything. Everybody who is walking around with you, in your timeline, doesn't know shit.

There is a benefit to this situation, though. More snaps for the Jets rookies – especially Davis, Hall and Jackson – will help the team more in the long run in a lost season.

Plus, this will give Joe Douglas an extended look at what he may have in his secondary, especially if he decides not to re-sign Poole, an impending free agent.

 “Influential farmers’ associations across the country are evincing keen interest and want Mr. KCR to create the platform. We are getting invites to address their meetings as they see a new dynamic approach taken by the Telangana government to redress farmers issues,” Ms. Kavitha, who is in touch with national level farmers’ associations, said.
 “They have realised the positive impact of KCR’s revolutionary idea of hand- holding the farmers at various levels and that the solutions he has shown to the decades-long problems can be implemented across the country.”
 Ms. Kavitha argued that people were tired of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and have seen through their ‘sinister designs’ and are looking at fresh perspective, which she feels KCR can provide. Congress is dying a natural death and its presence is barely felt in the country. So the country needs a leader with fresh ideas and approach to take the country forward as the BJP has failed to deliver.
