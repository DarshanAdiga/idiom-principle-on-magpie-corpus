This set of beliefs launches Dower into a torrent of meditations on theatre leadership as the timer on my free Zoom account forebodes a two-minute warning. "(ArtsEmerson) is a cultural asset, which means we do what the city needs. We have to name a mission outside of ourselves because what's on stage is not the point, it's the prompt. If your mission goes beyond the standard 'do good work' or 'putting interesting stories on stage that move you' _(grimace)_ you will always be in a state of evolution. For more than a generation, (American) Artistic Directors have mistaken themselves as the point. This has elevated us into the tower away from our communities. This is why we see a failure to evolve."

We're just as surprised as you are. Following the unstoppable hit parade that was _Control_ , _Rhythm Nation 1814_ , and _janet._ , it was obvious that not only was Janet Jackson on a roll, but her collaborative relationship with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis was yielding unprecedented rewards. When working with Jackson, these former Prince band members discovered a sound that hit that pop music sweet spot time and time again. Yet "Runaway" wasn't just a big, breezy, open-sky pop number: it became what is arguably her all-time signature song.
 Sure, fans can make arguments for "Rhythm Nation" or "What Have You Done for Me Lately?", but hearing those multi-tracked "yeahs" at the end, her sweet come-ons coupled with that vaguely worldbeat instrumentation and that earworm of a chorus -- simply put, _this is it_. This may very well be the single most definitive Janet Jackson song ever, and it was the lead single from her first Greatest Hits compilation. Even more so than Lenny Kravitz's "Again" or even Kenny Rogers' "Lady", having your most recognizable-ever hit come off of a compilation is a pretty astounding accomplishment no matter which way you chalk it up. Her greatest hit came from her Greatest Hits, and it's for that reason alone that Janet occupies the top spot.

While there is a large contingent of both fans and critics that will always circle around the Foo Fighters' first few albums and guard them like hawks, their latter-day albums have proven to be amazingly divisive. Critics ended up loving 2014's _Sonic Highways_ way more than fans did, just as fans readily embraced the all-rock, no-nuance surge of energy that is 2007's _Echoes, Silence, Patience, and Grace_. Yet for a group who can crank out modern-rock chart-toppers with astounding regularity, the new song included on their 2009 Greatest Hits set is a mid-tempo burner, the detail of that main riff luring you in while that slight pickup guitar squeal right at the top of every bar ends up giving just that right amount of attitude and flair to a track that could easily be reinterpreted as a country song under the right circumstances.
 This marks the Foo Fighters' aiming right for the heartland, but the warm, inviting chorus not only proved to be one of the most inspiring singles the band had ever churned out, but one of their most accessible as well. A rock- radio staple that never fully crossed over to the mainstream, this cut may very well be one of the best songs that Grohl and company have ever laid to tape, proving that Foo Fighters will always maintain their unshakable reputation even when they decide to go full-bore pop on us.
