There's no denying it. You are stressed out. We all are.
 The COVID-19 pandemic is taking a toll on each of us in myriad ways. A lot of folks have lost their job or know somebody who has. Many people in our area are working long hours donning PPE as essential workers. Families are mostly cooped up at home watching tragic TV news reports and reading negative newspaper headlines, with limited access to the healthy foods and rigorous fitness regimens we enjoyed as recently as early March.
 Most discouraging of all, we're missing our friends, families and countless milestones.
 And all of that is piled on top of our already stressed lives. One pre- pandemic study by the American Psychological Association found that nearly 1 in 4 Americans feel highly stressed.
 Our stress is having a significant effect on our mental health and physical well-being. Don't get us wrong, stress can be a great stimulant and motivator, but too much of it drains our energy, keeps us up at night, causes weight gain and sexual dysfunction, and contributes to high blood pressure. It also can impact our relationships with family and friends, given our sometimes less- than-pleasant demeanor due to cabin fever or reduced social interaction during the pandemic.
 What can we do? As the pandemic continues to unfold over the summer, there are a number of steps we can take to reduce our stress:
 Eat healthy foods. While we discussed the benefits of eating healthily on your immune system in a previous column, each of those recommendations can actually do wonders for managing your stress. By supporting our body with a balanced and nutritious diet and consuming more brain foods - for instance, polyunsaturated fats like fish oil and sunflower oil that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids - we can strengthen the nervous system and brain.
 Step away from the computer and phone and connect with the earth. Several studies have shown us that hours upon hours of screen time is detrimental to our stress levels, anxiety, sleep patterns and mental health. Couple this with the barrage of bad news from the global pandemic, and we have a tougher situation. We recommend taking time every day to step away from screens, whether it's the big flat screen in the living room or the little gadget buzzing in our hands. In those moments, find time to relax, meditate, walk around the block, or try "earthing," also known as grounding. This is a simple technique to connect you to the earth by either laying down on the grass or removing your shoes and going barefoot for about 20 minutes. Many people say they notice a sense of calmness and make it a daily routine to reduce stress.
 Exercise. Until gyms reopen, this may be the most difficult thing to work on. Many people have lost access to their go-to gym or fitness classes, but there are plenty of exercises that can be done in the comfort of your home or right outside the door. Virtual yoga sessions, workout classics like sit-ups and push-ups, or a simple 30-minute walk or bike ride (while wearing a mask when necessary) all can reduce stress through the stimulation of your brain. Keep moving to boost energy, burn fat and promote sleep.
 Supplements and other natural remedies. While there's no magic pill that can reduce your stress, sometimes supplements can help us get over the hump of reducing anxiety and help us relax. Given the importance of sleep to managing stress, taking melatonin, lavender, or CBD oil may help you fall asleep after a long day of working from home. Because stress can impact our immune system, supplements like vitamin C, zinc, elderberry, andrographis and astragalus can give our immune system the support it needs during the pandemic.
 Be social, safely. While this can be a challenge as we keep our distance for health reasons, building and maintaining a supportive social network of friends and family can help us cope. Calling a friend after a rough day, conversing with a friendly neighbor during your walk and video chatting with family are great ways to de-stress. People who will lend an ear or a virtual shoulder to lean on can support us and help alleviate our anxieties. If you are suffering from severe anxiety or depression, seek advice or treatment from a health care professional.
 Remember, we are all in this fight together. We hope that these tips can help you take a step back, relax, breathe and face this challenge head on.

 The Ivan Sand Community High School graduation ceremony, usually the most intimate of the four Elk River Area School District commencement exercises each year, was held virtually on June 12.
 Principal Deanna Chiodo, a longtime teacher at the high school in her first year as the school’s leader, kicked things off.
 “I am so grateful to have the opportunity to recognize the remarkable achievements of the class of 2020,” she said.
 She also recognized Superintendent Dan Bittman, Assistant Superintendent Jana Hennen-Burr, members of the Elk River Area School Board and each of the staff members of Ivan Sand who have walked alongside the graduates.
 “You are my first class,” she said. “I am humbled by you. Your resilience, your determination, your courage shown through each and every day left an indelible legacy.
 “We stand in awe in all that you have accomplished. We applaud your tenacity to stay the course.”
 Teachers Rebecca Hagen and Sandra Dahlberg presented this year’s scholarships that were given based on quality of applications and essays, past school performance, school activities, leadership roles and postsecondary education plans.
 Generous contributors include District 728 administrators, Three Rivers Community Foundation, Elk River Lions and Elk River Rotary.
 “We really enjoyed reading through the scholarship applications,” Hagen said. “Your personality showed through the writing and brought smiles to our faces.”
 Those who won scholarships want to pursue futures in political science, psychology, retail business management, machine technology, business and nursing.
 Ivan Sand elected two students speakers, including Hunter Strate, who told the virtual audience he was proud to be addressing fellow graduates.
 “Graduating is, or at least should be, a very big accomplishment,” Strate said. “I look at it as you’ve put effort into accomplishing one thing for 13 years of your life. I’m sure we all know people who dropped out either because they just didn’t want to do it or they had other plans.
 “But today we celebrate you, the students that didn’t give up. You all worked hard for this and we all know, there were no shortcuts. If it was easy, everyone would do it.”
 Strate decided to come to Ivan Sand to start his 10th grade year, because he didn’t want the big crowd of people “like I had at my previous school and I knew I needed more of the one-on-one learning and support to succeed.”
 “Some of you might have had the same reason,” he said. “Don’t get me wrong, (being at Ivan Sand) didn’t stop me from getting angry and getting in trouble from time to time.”

Coaches also have to operate practices with a 5-to-1 player to coach ratio and workouts must be conducted in pods of those five players for the duration of phase one.
 Even hours into the summer season Monday evening Socorro High School volleyball coach JB Mauldin and his staff and players were making the adjustments in order to attempt to make practices viable.
 “Kids are really resilient and I think they’re just going to follow the rules you put out for them. We’re just trying to follow the rules the best we can and give them an opportunity to come out here and get some activity in, get some touches on the ball,” Mauldin said. “Even though they’re just doing stuff with themselves at least it’s something. It’s a start. Obviously it’s not ideal for any of us, but we’re all just going to do the best we can and hopefully we can continue to make some progress and kind of get back to normal soon.”
 Every player on the Lady Warriors must use only their own personal ball, and during Monday’s practice members of the team were using walls to hit and set to themselves, while staying at least six feet apart. And there was no net, which might allow players to come into close personal contact.
 That’s definitely a far cry from a traditional volleyball practice, but Mauldin said his squad is adjusting well.
 “They’re doing great. A lot of these girls we had last year. Some of them are freshman and they’re brand new up here,” he said. “They’re listening, they’re trying to learn and they’re doing what the coaches are telling them. That’s all we can ask for. We’re kind of learning as we go. It is kind of tough.”
 But he didn’t go into Monday’s practice blind. He and assistant coach Joni Mauldin, who previously coached the Lady Warriors sat down and came up with a game plan. They figured out what type of practice would be worthwhile for the players, but still stay within the NMAA’s guidelines.
 “A lot of volleyball is working together; touching the same ball, passing to each other, playing against each other. Since we can’t do any of that we said what kind of things can we come up with that they can just do by themselves? So that’s what we’re doing,” JB said. “We just keep them working together and keep them all positive and to all work towards a common goal. Our common goal here is to learn, to have fun and let that translate to wins on the court. That’s our whole philosophy.”

Another benefit is where relationships are concerned. Money problems and fights over money are the leading causes of divorce in America. I’ve seen how proper budgeting principles can bring a sense of healing, hope and restoration to families. During budget meetings, couples learn to talk to each other like never before. They open up, share their dreams and fears, learn how to draw boundaries and plan for the future. And this benefit isn’t just for the married crowd. Folks who are single can develop more personal discipline and find accountability that has an impact on their relationships, too.
 It’s tempting to think the idea of “on paper, on purpose” is nothing but a catchphrase. But it’s so much more. Budgeting is absolutely the key to gaining control of your finances.

The abolition of slavery in the U.S. was followed by the birth of Jim Crow segregation, relegating many black Americans to poor, redlined neighborhoods with under-resourced schools. After the passage of landmark civil rights protections in the 1960s, decades of mass incarceration policy and employment discrimination eroded opportunities and economic stability for black people and families. All along, police brutality has been a fixture of the black American experience. And now, COVID-19 is killing black people at more than three times the rate that it kills white people.

Bristol, Rhode Island, is known for the oldest annual July 4 celebration in America. Its rich history and passion for everything red, white and blue earned its fame as America's most patriotic town. Each Independence Day thousands of spectators attend the parade that honors civil servants, military and fire personnel in the community.      This year -- due to constraints imposed by the coronavirus pandemic -- the 235th celebration will be a "drive-by" all-auto parade. Local bands will play, but there will be no marchers. Starting at 8:30 a.m., the annual star-spangled spectacle takes the parade route and ends at the town common for patriotic exercises.      "Bristol is open for business. All restaurants and lodgings are now up and running," said Jeff Hirsch, co-chairman of Explore Bristol, the town's tourism arm. "We expect most attractions to re-open in July."      The town's respect for the past runs deep. Hope Street is painted in red, white and blue stripes running down the middle. Nearly every house flies an American flag, while red, white and blue bunting covers porch railings. Pillows on the white wicker chairs of front porches are adorned with messages such as "Home of the Brave."      For three centuries, the shores of Bristol have framed a way of life for those who love to travel, fish and explore. This deepwater seaport is named after the town of Bristol, England. It has museums, historic homes, a waterfront and 20-plus restaurants all packed into a small town (pop. 22,000) in the smallest state in the nation.      Narragansett Bay is a dramatic backdrop for Bristol's wildlife preserves, parks, bike paths and quaint seafood restaurants. The stunning 14-mile East Bay Bike Path hugs the shore to Providence, the capital.      Magnificent architecture abounds. The historic district is lovingly preserved with homes from the 1800s and wide, tree lined streets.      Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum is one of the finest garden estates in New England, with 33 landscaped acres and a 45-room English-style 1908 manor house filled with antiques and artwork. Visitors often spend hours touring the grounds and mansion.      Located in the center of town on Hope Street, Linden Place is the crown jewel of the historic district. The 1810 mansion and sculpture gardens are open to the public for guided tours. The rich and powerful have graced the ancestral home of the DeWolf (no relation to the writer) and Colt families for more than two centuries. Presidents, industrialists and Hollywood celebrities were guests here, including the actress Ethel Barrymore. The mansion seeks to reopen soon; get information at lindenplace.org.      Bristol is the quintessential New England waterfront town. It is also a thriving arts community, abundant with a wealth of literary and cultural resources. A broad network of artists, writers and musicians have found a home here.      In keeping with social distancing practices, Sculpture on the Lawn is an outdoor exhibit by the Bristol Art Museum displayed on the front lawns of Linden Place Mansion and the Bradford-Dimond-Norris House on Hope Street. The exhibits run through Labor Day Weekend.      The 1792 Bradford-Dimond-Norris House is an elegant bed and breakfast and historic landmark known for its hospitable innkeepers.      Quahog chowder and fried clams are among the New England delicacies served at the Lobster Pot Waterfront Restaurant and Bar overlooking the bay. Don't miss the stunning art gallery on the premises.      Bristol is halfway between Providence and Newport. For updates on July 4 activities, go to fourthofjulybristolri.com.

The Lady Warriors went 15-11 last season, made the playoffs and went 2-2 in those playoffs before falling to Sandia Prep, who made an appearance in the Class 3A quarterfinals. Socorro graduated just one senior from last year’s team, so Mauldin expects his team to provide leadership heading into what may be an uncertain season.
 But his players still need to trust the process, even with the current state of things.
 “I think a lot of the older girls, they know that now. So we have a lot of girls who are going to be leaders on the court and in the locker rooms, so to speak. It’s a process so hopefully we can get them to buy into the process and continue to come together,” Mauldin said. “I’m excited about this season. Hopefully we can get back to normal soon. I’m hoping we can have an uninterrupted season. There are a lot of girls out. You never know how many you’re going to get in the summer. But we’re close to the max we’re even able to deal with. So that’s good. We’re looking forward to it.”
 The Warriors football team also began summer workouts at New Mexico Tech on Monday.
 Socorro is coming off a 10-2 season and an appearance in the Class 3A state championship. Being back on the field with his coaches and players, coach Damien Ocampo said it felt great to get to a sense of normalcy in a safe way.
 “We did I really good job I thought for the first day making sure that we checked for symptoms and we kept kids apart,” Ocampo said. “There are areas that we need to get better at but for the most part it was good. It seemed like it was wholesome time that these kids needed. We need to be around the kids.”
 As with every Socorro coach, Athletic Director Alex Johnson ensured that all of the school’s coaching staff had tested negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours of Monday’s practices. The Warriors’ had a thermometer on hand to test players, and coaches wore face masks.
 Despite the necessary safety precautions Ocampo said his kids were excited to be back on the field with one another.
 “A lot of them have been texting each other, messaging each other. I see them talking about how excited they were to get rolling and get back to being around each other, back to being around us and working hard together,” he said. “It’s a badge of honor and we feel like we’re the hardest working team in the state. For them to get back on that, I think it’s a breath of fresh air for them because that’s what they’re used to doing.”
 Ocampo said the thing that stood out to him most after Monday’s practice was simply that the kids were happy.
 “They love being around each other. They love to struggle with each other. They’re tight. These guys have been bleeding with each other since middle school,” he said. “And that’s a special thing. These are the young soldiers of Socorro. They’re excited to go put in the time and work hard together. They’re a family and make the community proud when we take the field on Friday nights.”

WINFIELD TWP. — A DeMotte man received multiple injuries after he was involved in a two-vehicle crash at the intersection of U.S. 231 and County Line Road in Winfield Township near Crown Point Tuesday morning.
 Kacey W. McCay, 33, suffered injuries, including burns to his body, after his vehicle, a 1995 Ford Ecoline van, was struck by a 2002 Buick driven by Eric J. Chaney, 32, of Gary.
 According to police reports, Chaney was traveling southbound from County Line Road when he entered the intersection and hit McCay’s vehicle, which was traveling west on U.S. 231.
 The impact caused the van to roll over and catch fire. McCay was able to scramble out of the van after breaking out a window in his van.
 Chaney was trapped and unconscious in his vehicle when first responders arrived.
 Both McCay and Chaney were flown by medical helicopter to the University of Chicago Medical Center.
 Several people stopped to assist at the scene before first responders arrived. Members of the Hebron Fire Department and Kouts Volunteer Fire Department were among the first responders on the scene.
 The crash remains under investigation.

Kewanee School Dist. 229 will go into the new fiscal year with several positive fund balances, but Supt. Chris Sullens warned of fiscal storm clouds on the horizon.
   
 In a budget meeting held prior to the board's regular June meeting Monday, Sullens said the fate of the state's new Evidence Based Funding model -- which supplied millions of additional revenue to rural districts across Illinois in attempt to improve funding equity -- hangs in the balance as the state struggles to meet the demands of fighting the virus.
   
 "It's going to be flatline next year," Sullens said of the state's decision to hold back on providing the additional $350 million it had promised annually under the EBF model. It would have been the third year of increased funding.
   
 "Before the economy did get stalled, things were looking pretty good," he said.
   
 Right now, after final adjustments, Dist. 229 will end up with positive balances in two of its three major fund categories -- the education and building funds -- of at least $200,000. The transportation fund has run about $200,000 in the red, that because of the state being behind on its final $180,000 payment. The third payment, which Sullens told the board last month he was worried the district might not receive, only recently arrived.
   
 "We did receive one more state payment for transportation, which was a nice surprise," he said.
   
 He said all of the uncertainty, including whether state revenue projections are accurate amid an uncertain recession, makes it hard to plan a budget.
   
 "When we look at the budget process," Sullens said, "you're looking at your best projections. You try to do your best job of forecasting, but sometimes things come up. Who knew what COVID-19 was back in September?"
   
 An additional $680,000 in COVID relief funds has allowed the district to purchase 1,800 new student Chromebooks and accompanying teachers' laptops. It also purchased a van to transport meals.
   
 Sullens said school officials are waiting to see if more relief funding will be made available to the states by the federal government, and whether Illinois will spend any of it on education.
   
 The board unanimously approved the amended budget.

“Despite violating Facebook’s terms of service, the ads were approved by Facebook in the first place,” Carusone said in a statement. “Yet again we see another example where Facebook can’t even meet the bare minimum standards they set for themselves — either because they’re incapable or because they’re in cahoots.

"The Court could have made clear that the solution (the challengers) seek must come from the Legislative Branch. … In doing so, it has given the green light for future political battles to be fought in this Court rather than where they rightfully belong—the political branches. Such timidity forsakes the Court's duty to apply the law according to neutral principles, and the ripple effects of the majority's error will be felt throughout our system of self- government."

While we have a tremendous amount of respect for the state officials in Rhode Island who have done an admirable job of keeping people in the state safe, we want to make sure that we're not forgotten about as we move through the phases of reopening," says Broccoli, "Particularly because many of the theaters in this group should be able to open sooner than larger spaces due to the special circumstances under which we operate. That means that while so many are stressing the importance of getting the private sector up and running again safely, we also need to be looking at the first part of the creative sector that can begin to come back, and that means theaters like the ones in this coalition."

We are committed to completing this investigation in the next several months, completing a report so that we have an opportunity in this Congress to introduce some legislation responsive to the absence of competition in the digital marketplace. And all of the harms it imposes in terms of privacy, in terms of control of your own data, in terms of consumer choices, in terms of innovation. This has significant implications on our economy, both in the short term and in the long term.

Although self-determination and a Kurdish state may not be the answer, Kurdish citizens deserve some autonomy in Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria. The whole region needs a break from Turkish aggression and aggrandisement. We do not need a Turkish-led caliphate any more than a Saudi one. Some suggest Islam needs a reformation to create a mutual recognition and respect of different traditions - Sunni, Shia, Alevi - and their relationship not to secularism but democracy. The UK needs to postpone the implementation of a Brexit decision based on lies irrelevant to the challenges we face. The ‘big men’ in the world - Bolsonaro, Erdoğan, Johnson, Modi, Morrison, Netanyahu, Putin, Trump - need to change, or be replaced, because gross inequality, authoritarianism, patriarchy, nationalism and populism can never be an answer to pandemics any more than to war and climate emergency. It all starts in Turkey – watch this space.

Also, I am afraid that many people have taken the governor’s economic opening as a signal that all bets are off. While we are thrilled to see the movement forward for increasing business, that does not mean that all protections are off the table. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still recommends social distancing, personal protective equipment (including masks), and social distancing, especially for medically compromised folks. And remember: You are not just protecting yourself when you do these things, you are helping your fellow citizens. The positive side of that is the citizens of Burnet have always stepped up to do the right thing and to help their fellows whenever the need arises. It’s one of the things that I love about Burnet.

Migis Lodge in southern Maine is considered one of the last of a classic breed, an American-plan lodge where tradition rules. Families return summer after summer, generation after generation, to this resort with a main lodge and scattered cottages set among 125 forested acres. It spans 3,500 feet of undulating wooded shoreline on Sebago Lake, Maine’s second largest lake. It’s also one of the last places where gentlemen over the age of 13 are required to wear a jacket after 5:30 and women are asked to dress accordingly. Families come to swim, play tennis, go waterskiing and take a hike.

At times, he said he realized he didn’t have as much support from his peers as he did his teachers.
 “I had a choice to follow the crowd or break away and do what I knew I wanted to do,” he said. “I couldn’t have graduated without all of the people who believed in and pushed me. I’m sure you all feel the same way. These same people turned into my friends. I had a lot of people who cared enough to push me and made sure I saw this day!”
 Strate said graduates have the power to become and do anything they set their minds to.
 “We have a unique challenge ahead of us because of the pandemic; however, we know how to take a difficult situation and turn it into something positive,” Strate said.
 Student Ryann Frolik also addressed her classmates, the school’s staff and family.
 “Although we can’t be gathered today, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to faculty, friends, and family on behalf of my fellow graduates. Today is not only a day of celebration, it is a time of reflection and a time to embrace.
 “The word that continues to come to mind as I think of this time we’re experiencing is ‘bittersweet.’
 “We should all reflect on the teachers and other supporters who have pushed us to be where we are today,” she said. “I personally have spent a good portion of this year reflecting on those who have shown me constant support.”
 Science teacher Therese Seitz was one of Frolik’s biggest supporters.
 “She was a teacher you could tell loved her job,” she said. “She came into our doors smiling every day, she was never angry and always willing to have a conversation, whatever the topic may have been.”
 Both Frolik and Seitz share a love of animals.
 “That is what is so special about Ivan Sand: Every single teacher wants to connect with you,” Frolik said. “You know our staff is very different from other schools after being in their presence for less than a day. They all beam with pride when our students are successful and engaged. On the other hand they also understand our struggles, and are patient and unwilling to give up on us.”
 The last thought Frolik shared came from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
 “Darkness does not drive out darkness, only light can do that,” she said. “I heard this quote by King while writing this speech.”
 She said when people only focus on how moments are bitter, they can never enjoy them as sweet.
 “I ask of my fellow classmates as we continue our journey into life, accept the bitter and embrace the sweet,” she said.

Today the Rubin Museum of Art launched a new participatory installation, The Lotus Effect, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lotuses take root in murky waters and burst into beautiful bloom above the surface. For The Lotus Effect, the Rubin invites members of the public to fold a lotus flower and dedicate their origami creation to someone or something that has helped them overcome a challenging time. When the Rubin reopens, people can contribute their folded piece to an installation in the Museum that will serve as a community-built symbol of gratitude and powerful reminder that collectively we can emerge from difficult moments.

Early in 2016, without any fanfare, a swarm of earthquakes silently revved up in Southern California. The quakes didn’t occur every day, and most were too small for humans to feel, but month after month the tremors continued to rumble and multiply. By the spring of 2018, thousands of little quakes were striking each month, some large enough to set lamps swaying and put residents of nearby towns on edge. Over the past four years there have been more than 22,000 temblors. Yet the source behind all this activity has been a mystery.
