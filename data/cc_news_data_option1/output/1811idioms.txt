8:04 p.m. - A deputy was dispatched to a Geneva Township residence in reference to a third party report of an assault. The 37-year-old complainant said her neighbor, a 55-year-old man, drunkenly attacked a person walking on the roadway. Another 24-year-old man had video of the incident. The 55-year- old was contacted and denied the incident, but said he will be going to bed. The male victim of the incident is unknown, and never contacted 9-1-1 for a report.

One Turkish economist, who declined to be named to avoid government backlash, said: “The central bank is using the reserves to slow down the depreciation of the currency. Meanwhile, policies where the real interest rate is negative is making the local currency unattractive and other policies don’t instill confidence. It is a very obvious set up where everyone is on edge and fearing something will happen.”

Where _A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip_ ranks alongside is nearly two dozen predecessors is anyone's guess. Still, there's no doubt that it's another wildly thought-provoking, fun, and wholly distinctive venture. Remarkably—and contrary to most artists who've been around this long—neither brother seems to have lost much, if any, of their original specialties and capabilities. Rather, Russell sounds virtually identical to how he did in the 1970s, and Ron is still coming up with wonderfully proficient yet madcap instrumentation and diversions. Thus, it's as clear as ever that even if the duo weren't bonded by blood, they'd be made for each other.

In the case of Pennsylvania, particularly, Toomey also noted that Wolf had no plan before Toomey developed and was rolling his out all the way back in mid- April--and that the news of his then-forthcoming plan forced Wolf's hand into moving to reopen some of the state from the perpetual lockdown. As such, while Wolf did ease restrictions in some of Pennsylvania on Friday, this week he also extended the lockdown in other parts of the state all the way out until early June--something Toomey says makes not much sense as he believes most of Pennsylvania is ready to reopen now and all of it should be ready sooner than Wolf is saying.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — UFC President Dana White still wants “Fight Island.”
 He’s temporarily settling for a peninsula.
 UFC 249 will serve as the first major sporting event to take place since the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of the country nearly two months ago. The bouts Saturday night in Jacksonville — the main event is set for pay-per-view — are expected to draw a large viewing audience considering the sports-craved nation has seemingly grown tired of replays and video game events.
 There’s nothing virtual about the reality of getting punched in the face.
 “Right now there is no Olympics. There is no Wimbledon. There is no NBA drafts. No NFL drafts,” said lightweight contender Tony Ferguson. “There is no (expletive) tennis. There is no soccer, hockey. There is no baseball. This what we bring to the table man and we are going out there and do our best and we are going to keep sports alive.”
 More like bring sports back to life.
 Ferguson and fellow lightweight contender Justin Gaethje will headline the mixed martial arts card behind closed doors at Veterans Memorial Arena.
 “This is going to bring a sense of normalcy to people,” Gaethje said. “Proud to be a part of it, you know the opportunity to inspire. People need to be inspired right now. They need to not let themselves become depressed, emotional because they can’t control what is going on right now.

We're in a different world right now and for the foreseeable future, that's for sure. The daily briefings, and the statistics that go with them, are part of our lives. Meanwhile, there are other things happening around the world. I'll take a shot at a few of them.
 Obscured by the chatter about the pandemic was a story 10 days ago that Jesse Ventura, formerly (and unbelievably) the governor of Minnesota, is going to "test the waters" for a Green Party presidential bid, according to a story in the Star Tribune. He sent out a tweet on April 27 saying that if he was going to run for president, it would be with the Green Party.
 Ventura was elected governor in 1998 as a Reform Party candidate and served one term, later becoming a member of the Independence Party. His term, I thought, was a mess. After Ventura was elected a friend in California sent an email saying, "Have you people lost your minds?" Four years later when Californians elected Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor (he served two terms), I sent that friend an email that asked, "Have you people lost your minds?"
 Anyway, if Ventura runs, I don't think he'll shock the world as he claimed he did when elected governor. The biggest question would be who the candidate would be that is likely to be hurt the most by those voting for Ventura, who kind of blew off Minnesota and was living in Mexico for awhile.
 There have been all kinds of ideas floated for the possibility of a season for major league baseball. Fans of the Minnesota Twins better hope that one of the ideas doesn't come to fruition if a story by R. J. Anderson of cbssports that came out last week is accurate. That was the one about there being three 10-team divisions, done geographically.
 The Twins would be in a division with Cleveland, both Chicago teams, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Kansas City, Cincinnati, Detroit and Atlanta. Every team would play 100 games and the top four teams in each division would advance to the playoffs, with the four best teams overall getting a first-round bye. There would be a one-game playoff among the eight other teams and the four winners would advance to play the top four, first with five-game playoffs and then with seven-game playoffs, the two remaining teams going to the World Series.
 That idea had a shelf life of about two days. However, before it died, Anderson's story had the Twins — a preseason favorite by some to win the American League's Central Division — finishing eighth with a sub-.500 record as St. Louis, Atlanta, Cleveland (Cleveland?) and Milwaukee going on to the playoffs.
 This week, the conversation beginning with a tweet by former Twin Tervor Plouffe, it appears there is another scenario in the works for major league baseball this summer. We'll see what happens. A national survey shows that a majority of fans say they would like to see baseball return, even if it meant no fans in the stands. They said they'd watch on TV.
 Did you notice that Target CEO Brian Cornell had compensation of $21.6 million for the year ended Feb. 1, 2020? His salary was ONLY $1.4 million but the other perks got him up to the $21 million mark.
 In a company that has a median pay of $23,080, Cornell's compensation figures out to a 821-1 pay ratio, a 7% increase over the previous year. Of course, the poor guy's total compensation decreased 4% from the previous year.
 Target is doing well, no doubt. But that's ridiculous.
 The Minnesota Vikings, if you listen to some in the media, had a great draft recently. Some say it was one of the top ones in the NFL. A nephew who lives in Indiana and has been a Vikngs fan for about 50 years, told me on the phone this week that "it was a great draft."
 My response was that, for once, I agree with Sid Hartman, the 100-year-old sports columnist for the Star Tribune. Through the years Sid has consistently said that the draftees have not played one minute with the team and no one knows how they will do. That statement is right on the mark. A few of the 15 players drafted may turn out well. Fans hope so but they don't really know.
 Then, last week, there was Sid proclaiming that the signees by the University of Minnesota in football and basketball were outstanding. Maybe they will be. But, not a one of them has played a down or made a basket yet for the Gophers.
 Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president, has been accused by a former employee of sexual assault when Biden was a U.S. senator. Biden has denied the charge, saying it "never, never happened." And a opinion piece in the Star Tribune on Thursday of this week by an Edina woman asked what Biden intends to do about a report he made women in the Secret Service uncomfortable by skinny-dipping in front of them.
 I have no idea what the truth is, just like I had no idea in 2018 when Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was accused of a sexual assault by a woman who said it happened when they were teenagers.
 Kavanaugh was eventually confirmed as a justice after a great outcry, both in the media and by those affiliated with the MeToo movement. There were reams of copy about the accusation, some saying they believed the woman who made the accusation. For some reason there hasn't been a similar outcry so far in the Biden case, leading some to say there's been a double standard applied.
 I repeat — I don't have any idea who, in either case, was or is telling the truth. It does seem, however, that there has been less discussion in the media about the Biden case than the Kavanaugh case.

I confess to being rather enchanted by Markus Lake. He's a guy with a "We Jam Econo" Minutemen tattoo who cut his teeth in the Calgary punk scene, moved to Montreal, and has been an active part of the DIY music community there as both performer and organizer. He plays (and has played) with a wide diversity of bands ranging from Egyptian Cotton Arkestra to punk band Neighbour's Guitar to Elle Barbara's Black Space, and has a degree in electroacoustics to boot. What enthuses me is that willingness to immerse entirely in music as a youthful thrill; as a community; as an infrastructure; as a wide range of performance models; as an intellectual practice that rewards deep and patient consideration.
 Accompanying his 'all in' devotion to music, Lake has a calm and unpretentious approach that can be seen in his decision to simply name his solo albums _First Album_ , _Second Album_ and _Third Album_. It reflects the belief that music isn't just something one does; it's a life one leads, so each release is an excerpted component of an ongoing and all-encompassing journey. The titles on _Third Album_ also reinforce this ideal of travel in the form of a 'little engine that could' mantra: "Forward", "And", "Forward Again", "Always", "Moving", "Forward Always". Even the gentle switch of Markus Lake recording as Markus Floats has a charming sense of movement to it.
 The majority of _Third Album_ consists of a variety of synthesizer patterns drawn in thick lines over a snake-pit of shifting and sliding drones. The commonality of titling is in harmony with the unity of the compositions themselves, which all seem to explore similar terrain. "And" is centered on an effervescent loop that bubbles over and over until subtle interventions nudge it into new shapes – it's like Lake is building a composition around an early Steve Reich composition. That initial proposition is increasingly disrupted by very subtle field recordings, held synth tones, more rapid intervention and retraction of elements.

If you have any experience hearing Steve Dawson performing with Chicago-based indie roots-rock band Dolly Varden (or before that, the twang-punk outfit Stump the Host), it's hard to imagine a follow-up project sounding anything like Funeral Bonsai Wedding. His former bands were certainly respectable and well-loved, but Dawson's current project contains plenty of moments that scale heights unimaginable with any previous bands. _Last Flight Out_ is the long- awaited follow-up to the self-titled 2014 Funeral Bonsai Wedding debut album. While it contains the same sophisticated jazz/pop touchstones of its predecessor – vibraphone, upright bass, plenty of quizzical lyrics – added elements push the album into the stratosphere, creating an almost otherworldly sophistication. This isn't so much an album as it is musical world-building. It contains that level of heft and depth.
 In addition to Dawson's guitar and vocals, _Last Flight Out_ also includes vibraphonist Jason Adasiewicz, drummer Charles Rumback – whose collaboration with Ryley Walker on the album _Little Common Twist_ resulted in one of last year's most well-received instrumental releases – and bassist Jason Roebke. Upping the ante is the inclusion of the Chicago-area string ensemble Quartet Parapluie. Their presence is vital to what makes this album work. The songs are expertly crafted, the core band sounds impeccable, but the strings add an element that separates _Last Flight Out_ from other similarly ambitious albums.
 Dawson's voice a wonder to behold, a full-throated cross between Neil Finn and Josh Tillman, and the songs run the gamut from eerie slices of baroque rock reminiscent of cult singer/songwriter Eric Matthews to the chamber pop of mid- period XTC. Rich, full string arrangements mesh with an acoustic guitar on the opening title track, and Adasiewicz completes the picture with a loose, jazzy vibes solo. The arrangements become a bit more experimental with "Mastodons", as the strings groan and creak as if they're trapped under the weight of Dawson's beautiful angst.

Starting a business has been one of the most challenging and rewarding decisions I've ever made. Fortunately, Congressman Ross Spano understands small businesses are the backbone of the nation's economy and has made fighting for them one of his top priorities.
   
 In 2017, I retired early from law enforcement to join my dad and brother in starting a roofing business. Starting with just an old pickup truck and a small crew of roofers, we now employ over 31 personnel and provide roofing services throughout the state of Florida. The current economic crisis, brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, placed our dreams of running a business in jeopardy.
   
 As Florida's only representative on the House Small Business Committee, Congressman Spano understood the need to act quickly on behalf of Florida's small businesses. On March 27, President Donald Trump signed the CARES Act into law, providing desperately needed funding to small businesses.
   
 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once stated, "The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy." My family and I will be forever grateful for Congressman Spano's unwavering leadership during these unprecedented times.

The beginning of May is usually an exciting time for students. Seniors count the days until graduation; younger kids look forward to vacation and camps.
   
 School's out for summer!
   
 But this year ends with a shrug.
   
 Amid a COVID-19 scare, public schools across Florida have been closed since March as school districts finish the year online. "Distance learning" programs were cobbled together on the fly, a labor of necessity. And while this instruction is better than nothing, many parents and students are finding it underwhelming at best.
   
 Across the country some districts are choosing to end the year early rather than continue with distance learning. Public school officials in Washington, D.C., and some areas of Georgia, Texas and a few other states say it's proving too difficult for both students and parents.
   
 Some students, for whatever reason, aren't applying themselves as they would in the classroom; and in some poorer communities, many students aren't logging on at the same rate as wealthier children.
   
 None of this should be seen as a reflection on educators, who have struggled to make it work. And cyber-learning might be optimal for some students. But many others fare better -- academically, emotionally, physically -- surrounded by their peers in a classroom with a teacher up front commanding their attention and orchestrating their efforts.
   
 This spring, students had to forgo this. It may leave a lasting impact.
   
 Could the effects of COVID-19 slow the academic progress of this generation of students? To what extent will the disruption manifest itself in reading progress, mathematical ability and standardized test scores?
   
 Gov. Ron DeSantis has said Florida parents will have the option of keeping their children in the same grade if they're not ready to move on. Many parents throughout our region are beginning to have those conversations, wondering how to balance their childrens' academic and social needs, how their sons and daughters might react if their friends move up but they don't.
   
 School districts are discussing summer programs that might help prepare students for the 2020-21 school year. This could help, but if those programs are voluntary rather than mandatory, many students who need the extra instruction the most might not benefit.
   
 This week, the Florida Department of Education launched a survey asking parents and teachers how the pandemic has impacted their lives. The survey asks primarily about respondents' comfort with students returning to campus. Would you feel comfortable with children being at school this summer? Should classes resume in mid-August, as scheduled, or should the start of the year be pushed back until after Labor Day?
   
 Responses might help shape the length of the 2020-21 school year. But so much more needs to be done.
   
 Local school districts remain mostly in reactive mode, trying to finish out this chaotic year. That's understandable, but we hope local education leaders are thinking about not just the length of the 2020-21 school year, but the content. They'll need strategies to help students regain any ground lost from the COVID-19 disruption.
   
 We don't pretend to know exactly what that looks like at. But the discussions -- at both the local and state levels -- can't happen soon enough.

But nearly all of the athletes have been patrolling streets to enforce confinement rules in place since mid-March. The government only began loosening lockdown restrictions this week.
 The police have been busy everywhere across the country, having already handed out almost 800,000 fines and detaining nearly 7,000 people for leaving quarantine.
 “Considering the situation we are in, there was no reason not to go back to the streets and lend a hand for a few months to help keep the pandemic from spreading,” Méndez told the AP. “I’m enjoying this opportunity to help others. I can’t wait for sports to resume, but first we have to take care of people’s health.”
 A former beach soccer goalkeeper, the 37-year-old Méndez is also the current coach of Spain’s men’s and under-21 beach soccer teams. He became a police officer in 2006 and since then had been sharing his time between the sport and the police force.
 “In the end, it’s all about dealing with people,” he said. “I have to make sure that my players understand our goals, our tactics. And I have to make sure that the population understands that most people are not allowed to go out. Sometimes I have to be tough with my players, and it’s the same as a police officer when someone does something wrong.”
 Both Méndez and Craviotto, who became a police officer in 2007, volunteered to patrol the streets after the state of emergency was declared.

 Another I’d feel wary of is the Buffalo game.
 A long trip against a good defense in what might be cold weather the week after playing the 49ers seems like it could be trouble.
 That Seattle is favored in seven of eight home games puts the Seahawks ahead of the curve -- according to BetOnline.ag it has the home team favored in 64.8 percent of games this season.
 BetOnline.ag also has a lot of teams with a lot of positive-looking season lines this year --\- the Ravens are favored in every game, New Orleans and Kansas City in 14, San Francisco in 13 and Tampa Bay in 12.
 The worst teams against the spread? Jacksonville is an underdog in all 16 while two teams Seattle plays are favorites two times or fewer -- the Giants are favored just once and Washington twice.

"In my case, I began working on my plan because the governor had not released one. There was no plan," Toomey said.

Well, okay, that's good and that's progress. But part of the impetus of my doing a plan is because Pennsylvania did not have one. Then the reason I've continued to weigh in on this is I think our governor's plan moves just way too slowly. Look, as you know, having never been through this before, there's no plan on the shelf. Nobody ever contemplated the government shutting down our economy. It's just so bizarre and so unprecedented. So there's no plan for how you restore the economy. I think it's something we've got to have a vigorous debate about, and I feel like I have a point of view and I have an opportunity to get input from a tremendous wide range of really valuable sources all over Pennsylvania and beyond and so I've got a responsibility to lay out a vision, a process, a mechanism by which we restore our ability to have a livelihood."

A mistake I made when starting out as an acupuncturist was not identifying the fact that two different issues that a patient was suffering from were in fact related.

After a review of the case and further investigation of the patient medical history, I understood that the two complaints were in fact two different manifestations of the same underlying issue. After identifying the root problem, I was able to target it and cure the patient.

Ultimate Fighting Championship chief Dana White's determination to drag the mixed martial arts series out of coronavirus quarantine culminates Saturday in UFC 249.
 White's controversial plans to stage a fight card in April on an Indian tribal reservation in California were thwarted.
 But he got the green light in Florida to hold bouts without spectators and will televise UFC 249 from Veterans Memorial Stadium in Jacksonville, headlined by an interim lightweight title bout between Tony Ferguson and Juston Gaethje.
 Both fighters made weight on Friday at a weigh-in where media members and most UFC staff were kept at a distance, those closer to the fighters wore masks and the scale was sanitized.
 Bantamweight champion Henry Cejudo and former champ Dominick Cruz both made weight for their title bout as well.
 With the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and Major League Soccer all on hold -- along with the US PGA Tour and LPGA -- White touts the return of UFC as a step toward normalcy and a boon for sport-starved fans.
 And he says that's a step US President Donald Trump was backing in a conference call with US sports league leaders back in April.
 "The president's take on it was we have to get live sports back first," White told the Los Angeles Times. "Show everybody how to do it safely. Give people who have to stay home some entertainment so they're not bouncing off the walls. From there, we can figure out how we get people back to work and how we get kids back to schools.
 "I'm going first. ... hopefully after I do this, other leagues will start looking and say, 'Yeah, we can do this.'"
 White thought he would escape California state lockdown measures when he planned an event for April 18 on Indian casino land, but that plan eventually folded when Walt Disney Co, owner of UFC broadcaster ESPN, stepped in and asked him to postpone.
 Florida governor Ron DeSantis opened the door when he gave "essential services" status to employees at pro sports and media productions with a national audience.
 And White, who has also announced cards for May 13 and 16 in Jacksonville, insists the production won't put anyone at risk.
 "Listen, we have families, too," White told CNN Sport. "I have a family; I don't want to hurt my family. I don't want to die.
 "This isn't just some crazy, this is a well thought-out plan. We've had very, very smart people, doctors and people that have been involved with the UFC for a very long time working on this thing non-stop since it started. We believe that we have this thing in a place where it can be as safe as it can possibly be."

 The beginning of May is usually an exciting time for students. Seniors count the days until graduation; younger kids look forward to vacation and camps.
 School's out for summer!
 But this year ends with a shrug.
 Amid a COVID-19 scare, public schools across Florida have been closed since March as school districts finish the year online. \"Distance learning\" programs were cobbled together on the fly, a labor of necessity. And while this instruction is better than nothing, many parents and students are finding it underwhelming at best.
 Across the country some districts are choosing to end the year early rather than continue with distance learning. Public school officials in Washington, D.C., and some areas of Georgia, Texas and a few other states say it's proving too difficult for both students and parents.
 Some students, for whatever reason, aren't applying themselves as they would in the classroom; and in some poorer communities, many students aren't logging on at the same rate as wealthier children.
 None of this should be seen as a reflection on educators, who have struggled to make it work. And cyber-learning might be optimal for some students. But many others fare better -- academically, emotionally, physically -- surrounded by their peers in a classroom with a teacher up front commanding their attention and orchestrating their efforts.
 This spring, students had to forgo this. It may leave a lasting impact.
 Could the effects of COVID-19 slow the academic progress of this generation of students? To what extent will the disruption manifest itself in reading progress, mathematical ability and standardized test scores?

The Big East was forced to cancel its annual men’s conference tournament on March 12 at halftime of the first of four scheduled games that day because of the escalation in COVID-19 cases. Ackerman had no second thoughts about deciding to play the game that day, saying city health officials, the league’s board and senior medical personnel from the NCAA also backed the choice that morning. Ackerman said the league has had event cancellation insurance for years. Many other conferences have similar policies for their major events.
 In the past two months, Ackerman said the league has talked to its presidents, coaches, doctors and the NCAA about the future and building a playbook for it.
 “Really everyone in the college sports community is trying to pick up the pieces from March and trying to figure out all of this uncertainty, this unprecedented uncertainty, and what our options are going to be, particularly this fall," she said, “and how they relate to practices, to competitions, to conference championships and, of course, NCAA championships.”
 The league is building alternative scheduling models.
 Cancellation of the NCAA basketball tournament was a major financial hit to many conferences, particularly the Big East, which expected to have at least six teams make the event. Money dried up because without the tournament there were no ticket sales or television revenue.
 Ackerman said the conference, which has universities and colleges in 10 states and the District of Columbia, will be governed down the road by the rulings of local governments.
 The Big East consists of Villanova, Creighton, Seton Hall, St. John's, Georgetown, DePaul, Providence, Marquette, Xavier, Butler and former charter member Connecticut, which is returning to the conference on July 1.
