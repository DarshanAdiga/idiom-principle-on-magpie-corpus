"Of course any funding coming into the sector to support with fighting the disease and providing education is welcome ... but the guidance so far has been opaque to say the least", she said.
 "The government's message of initially saying there wasn't anything to worry about in care homes, and then shortages some sites have seen on PPE, have escalated anxieties of people working in care.
 "The new government fund is for care homes to make sure they have support for infection control, but a lot of providers do this anyway and they do feel it is too little, too late.
 "To send people who are infectious into care homes is why the problem began in the first place, but this was allowed under government guidance - and still is. Hindsight is a wonderful thing."
 Both Nottingham City and Nottinghamshire County councils have explained to Nottinghamshire Live that infection control procedures are already taking shape.

Thanks, Kim, and everyone for taking the questions and congrats on yet another strong quarter. I guess, I had a question here about kind of the state level patient growth. And we've seen it -- it's still growing well, but a little bit slower, I think, in Q2 than we've seen in Q1 and Q4 last year. And is that just a result of COVID restraining some patient movements, or is that indicative of maybe just a slower trend in patient growth? And, in light of that, the market volumes continue to outpace patient growth. So are patients going to continue to spend more as they have recently after COVID? Just get your thoughts on that would be great.

The appeal, which will be heard at 9:30 a.m. Thursday by a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, centers on whether Blakey erred in ruling the center will serve a public function, instead of what the plaintiffs allege was a land and money grab by the city’s political elite.
 “Throughout this entire process, the city’s primary, indeed sole, loyalty was to the former president personally and his foundation,” lawyers for Protect Our Parks wrote in its appellate brief, which noted that one of the center’s top cheerleaders, then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel, had served as Obama’s White House chief of staff.
 Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the lawyers will participate in arguments Thursday via a Zoom feed, with a livestream posted on the court’s YouTube channel for the general public. A ruling would come at a later date.
 Herb Caplan, president and co-founder of Protect Our Parks, told the Chicago Tribune in an interview this week that he’s optimistic about their chances on appeal.
 “We’re obviously being outspent and outpowered by both the city of Chicago and the University of Chicago and the Obama Foundation,” Caplan said. “But we believe in the rule of law. … I’m confident that the court will do the right thing."
 A spokesperson for the Obama Foundation said Wednesday the district court ruled decisively that the center will “offer considerable public benefits to the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois.”
 "We appreciate the outpouring of support we’ve received for the (project) across Chicago and remain eager to deliver the benefits that will come from building a global destination on Chicago’s South Side,” the spokesperson said.

Now jumping to autonomous driving, Baidu continues to see improvements in this area. Talking at a conference last year, Baidu CEO Robin Li demonstrated the "valet parking" service that lets a car find a parking spot on its own after dropping off the driver. While the self-parking service isn't the home run revenue driver that investors are looking for, it's still expected to help generate near-term revenue for the company before it can start having fully autonomous cars hit the road. Baidu continues to make progress on this front as it now has more than 100 Apollo-powered autonomous vehicles that are deployed across 17 cities in China.
 During the first quarter, the company won a number of projects from local municipalities in China. Management also went on to say that Baidu was recognized as 1 of the 4 global leaders in autonomous driving based on strategy, branding, functionality, and reliability, including being named the exclusive autonomous driving leader in China.
 ## The Bad
 With the popularity of apps and live streaming, etc., user behavior in China is shifting from traditional browser search to in-app search. In fact, the majority of Baidu's search traffic comes from mobile search traffic. This behavior has led Baidu to do all it can to protect its dominant market share.
 However, competition continues to come.
 ByteDance (BDNCE), which owns video-sharing apps TikTok and Douyin, has launched a standalone search engine app, further challenging Baidu's dominance in China's online search market. The eight-year-old company has seen its valuation soar over the year as it has been taking revenue share from China's top tech firms in Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu. Just yesterday, reports had ByteDance valued at over 100 billion \- up more than 25 billion in less than a year.
 Late last year, management continued to shrug off the threat from ByteDance, saying that several players try to come into the search engine market each year, yet, they continue dominating the market over the past two decades.

Yes, Rob, I would say that if you look across most industries, I think that I don't know that 43% and certainly within our own sector could be considered low. I'm assuming you're talking about it relative to our specific company performance, which, again, I continue to just be really proud of our team for continuing to push the envelope in all areas and particularly EBITDA which we’ve been focused on. I think that we recognize, right, that we have operational efficiencies given our footprint -- our footprint in Florida. But we definitely will continue to see some fluctuations there, as we've mentioned in Florida, depending on what we have happening on the growth side and inventories and so forth as we've discussed. But then, of course, as we look to expand into other markets, we think that there will be different margin profiles, potentially, particularly linked to regulatory restrictions and different ways that we may have to operate in those markets. And so I think that that's what we mean when we say normalized rate. And certainly taking into account for the fact that we will see fluctuations even in Florida from quarter-to-quarter.

Lancaster, California will be home to a "greener than green" trash-to hydrogen production plant three times the size of any other green H2 facility. SGH2 says its process is the cleanest of all on the market, while matching the price of the cheapest producers – and pulling tens of thousands of tons of garbage out of landfills.
 For better or worse, many world economies are gearing up to make hydrogen a significant part of the future energy economy. Japan and Korea in particular are making big moves and enormous investments to get this zero-local-emissions energy storage format up and running.
 Production of hydrogen can vary from the relatively green (electrolysis of fresh water using solar or wind-based energy) to the profoundly filthy (gasification of brown coal) – and the filthiest are by far the cheapest. Adding carbon capture and sequestration to dirty processes simply makes them more expensive.
 That's what makes this SGH2 project so interesting – the company claims it can take trash that would otherwise sit in a landfill and rot, and turn it into super-green hydrogen at bargain-basement prices.
 According to a recent memorandum of understanding, the city of Lancaster will host and co-own the SGH2 Lancaster plant, which will be capable of producing up to 11,000 kg of H2 per day, or 3.8 million kg per year, while processing up to 42,000 tons of recycled waste per year. Garbage to clean fuel, with a US$2.1 to $3.2 million saving on landfill costs per year as a sweetener.
 "We are the only company in the world delivering green hydrogen that is cost competitive with the cheapest, dirtiest hydrogen made from coal and gas, and much less expensive than other green hydrogen" says SGH2 CEO Dr. Robert Do. "Our technology can scale quickly and produce fuel 24/7, year-round."  
 ## How it works
 The process, developed by SGH2's parent company Solena, uses high-temperature plasma torches putting out temperatures between 3,500 and 4,000 °C (6,332 to 7,232 °F). This ionic heat, with oxygen-enriched gas fed in, catalyzes a "complete molecular dissociation of all hydrocarbons" in whatever fuel you've fed in, and as it rises and begins to cool, it forms "a very high quality, hydrogen-rich bio-syngas free of tar, soot and heavy metals."
 The process accepts a wide variety of waste sources, including paper, old tires, textiles, and notably plastics, which it can handle very efficiently without toxic by-products. The bio-syngas exits the top of a plenum chamber, and is sent to a cooling chamber, followed by a pair of acid scrubbers to remove particulate matter.
 A centrifugal compressor further cleans the gas stream, leaving a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. This is run through a water-gas shift reactor that adds water vapor and converts the carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and more hydrogen gas. The two are separated, neatly capturing all the CO2 as hydrogen comes out the other end.

Apparently magnetic eyelashes are a "thing."      I realized this when I started getting a suspicious number of Facebook ads for magnetic false eyelashes. I thought that maybe it was just me and Facebook had determined somehow that I was eyelash-challenged and in desperate need of a solution. But then I found out that my friends were also getting the same ads, so it seemed we were a nation of eyelash-deficient women who could only be saved from this crisis by fake magnetic eyelashes.      In the ads, women applied a magnetic eyeliner on their eyelids which created a magnetic field that attracted a pair of polar opposite eyelashes. This is actually more science than anyone who buys their makeup out of a sale bin at the drugstore needs to know. Supposedly, though, this is a much easier system for applying eyelashes than the old "glue-on and hope you don't glue your eyelids shut" method. I tried the old glue-on method once and the eyelashes came unglued, fell on my cheek, and then someone slapped me because it looked like I had a hairy caterpillar on my face.      After a while, the eyelash ads began to taper off. But then, suddenly, I started getting ads for a fortifying eyelash serum so I could grow out my own pathetic eyelashes and not have the need for magnetic ones. Not wanting to put anything potentially dangerous near my eyes (um, like magnets) I found out that the secret ingredient in this serum was … wait for it … seaweed kelp.      Now my husband had a choice between living with me 24/7 with either hairy caterpillars on my face or smelling like a fresh fish market all the time.      Wanting to make sure that I wasn't missing the boat here, I thought maybe I should check with my husband, the one person who might actually care what my eyelashes looked like and how my face smelled.      "Hey honey," I said. "Do you think I need better eyelashes?"      "Is that a trick question?" he asked. "Like, 'Do these pants make me look fat?'"      "No, I just want to make sure you don't feel let down by my skimpy lashes."      "You have beautiful eyelashes and those pants don't make you look fat," he said. "Am I safe now?"      Clearly, this is not the most important issue on the planet right now, which led me to wonder why someone would think it was so essential for me to have eyelashes of any length at this moment. I'm not going to be batting them at anybody while I'm in isolation. Seriously, who am I going to impress? My dog? He has no opinion on my eyelashes whatsoever. He just wants to know when he's going to be fed, and doesn't care if I have fabulous eyelashes when I serve him his kibble.      With all this attention being paid to my eyelashes, I wondered if this was indicative of a larger beauty problem that had escaped my attention. Honestly, I didn't think I was letting myself go. I still shaved my legs and did my nails and even occasionally put on some makeup when I planned to Facetime with someone and I didn't want to scare their children if they happened to glance at the screen. So, overall, I didn't think I needed magnetic eyelashes or eyelash seaweed serum. What I did need to do was have a talk with customer service at Facebook and tell them they should focus on what's really important.      My eyebrows.

However, plans changed on the day of, which didn't bother The Undertaker because he just wanted to make sure that Vince was sure of his plans.
 "It had gone back and forth. I showed up that day thinking I was going over, and it changed the day of," Undertaker revealed.
 "All I wanted to make sure was that he had thought it all through because by that point, it was whoever was the main event then there was 'The Streak.' Those two things were the two most important things at WrestleMania. If you weren't in the main event, you definitely wanted to be against The Undertaker trying to break 'The Streak.' So obviously, when you broke it, you lose that aspect of WrestleMania. So I just wanted to make sure he was confident and that was the decision that he felt comfortable with.

 "I've had many messages of grief," said Tony DeLuca, executive director of the Little Falls Family YMCA, who heads the organization of the annual festival. "It was a result of the current conditions, the closures and the requirements that say no mass gatherings."
   
 A mass gathering is "the essence of what this is," he said. "We bring people in from all over the state and out of the state. Alumni come back into town. There's the picnic, the parade, the concerts, they all fall under mass gathering."
   
 If the event were to go forward, this would be the time organizers would be seeking sponsors and booking bands. Given the situation, asking businesses for sponsorships right now "would be tough ask," he said.
   
 "I talked with the mayor," said DeLuca. "We've been putting the decision off. The city has supported the event for 32 years -- this would have been our 33rd -- but logistically it's almost impossible."
   
 "This is definitely disappointing, but at the end of the day it's clearly the right decision," said Little Falls Mayor Mark Blask. The event brings families and friends together each year, he added, "and that flies in the face of what we're trying to do to keep people socially distant. It's not an easy decision, but it's the right one."
   
 Asked if it might have been possible to have some individual events take place, he said, "I think it's all or nothing. People are used to having the parade kick it off, the car show and all the food. All of these things draw a lot of people and it would be a recipe for disaster."
   
 The activities are all good, he added, "But we need to keep people safe and healthy."
   
 Local organizations conduct fund-raisers during the celebration and it also provides a source of revenue for restaurants, vendors and small businesses.
   
 "The economic impact just adds to the misery," said DeLuca.
   
 Little Falls Elks Lodge No. 42 BPOE is one of the organizations that will be feeling the pain, according to Brian Marhaver, who has chaired the Elks Canal Celebration activities for more than 25 years.
   
 "The BPO Elks at Little Falls has a wonderful facility with a great porch and lawn that we use to provide live entertainment, outdoor activities beer and food sales," he said in an email statement. "Our chicken and rib barbecues have been a favorite for years. One thing we will miss is the great comments that our events are the highlight of (festival-goers') summer visit to Little Falls. Canal Days at the Little Falls Elks has been very popular with the attendees. We budget a profit each year to cover some of our lodge expenses - like our $6,600 in property taxes, building insurance and utilities."
   
 The organization also supports charities and youth programs, such as Little League and Boy Scouts, as well as veterans, Cerebral Palsy and scholarships for local students.
   
 The Elks, along with social and veterans clubs are all struggling to survive, "as our younger generation is not a 'joining" group," said Marhaver. "This pandemic will take its toll on all of us."
   
 Rob Richard, who is active in the city's business community, said, "Nobody likes canceling such a long-running community event such as Canal Days. Though we are hopeful about the future and progress being made to fight the virus, it's hard to see clearly what the situation will be like in August. An event like this takes months to plan and there are many vendors involved. Unfortunately, decisions have to be made far in advance."
   
 He added, "I think we're all learning to have a deeper appreciate for these events, now that they're being canceled. My hope is that in the interim, individuals and groups try to find ways of creating 'community' in other ways."
   
 Blask said that on the plus side, the cancellation could give the Canal Celebration committee a chance to look at new activities for next year's event.
   
 The annual celebration includes family-oriented activities and programs held in multiple venues throughout the city with more than 100 people working to make them happen. Local organizations, businesses and industries, as well as city employees get involved.
   
 The activities, ranging from a youth fun paddle and fishing derby to arts and crafts and a car show are "a means to showcase Little Falls as a community with vigor and pride," according to the Canal Celebration website. A fireworks display and a parade are also included in the week-long festival.

HORNELL -- Christopher R. Clark, an intelligence analyst who for more than a dozen years has assisted Fortune 500 companies and high net-worth earners with some of their most sensitive cyber security issues, is used to going it alone in his day-to-day employment.
 Even before the coronavirus pandemic forced millions of American workers to perform their jobs remotely, Clark -- currently chief intelligence analyst for Secure Network Technologies and a senior intelligence analyst for Blackbird.A1 -- was a remote worker, having been working from home since 2007.
 That's why the prospect of serving on the Hornell Board of Education -- Clark is a candidate for an unexpired three-year term in the June 9 election -- is so appealing to the Maple Street resident. He says he relishes the opportunity to collaborate with six other board members, helping to chart a course for the district.
 "Overall, I see how they're all on the same team, they're all on the same page, and I get a little jealous of that sometimes because working remotely, I'm kind of on an island here, just doing my intelligence work," Clark said. "The collaboration, feeling part of a team, and at the end of the day, working on something that's going to benefit the community and my own kids."
 Clark and his wife, Katherine, a Hornell City School District psychologist, are the parents of three children --a 6-year old first grader and a 5-year-old kindergartener in Hornell City Schools, and a 1-year-old.
 Coaching is another of Clark's connections to the school district and its students. He is currently an assistant coach for the Hornell High School girls' varsity basketball squad and he has been a volunteer coach for youth basketball at the Hornell Area YMCA for the past several years.
 "It sometimes feels like you're working on an island when you're working from home, so I started coaching. It makes me feel like a part of something again. That's one of the reasons for sure, to feel like I'm part of a team again," Clark said.
 Clark earned a bachelor's degree in history from the University at Buffalo, where he also minored in sociology. He acquired a master of science degree in applied intelligence from the Mercyhurst College Institute for Intelligence.
 In his position at Syracuse-based Secure Network Technologies, Clark is chief analyst in the newly created PROSINT Secure brand, having developed and managed the company's open source intelligence (OSINT) offerings.
 Earlier in his career, at Mindstar Security & Profiling, Clark worked with business executives and their families on security assessments, identifying risks and reviewing security policies.
 If elected, Clark said he would bring his experience in research and analysis to his school board role.
 "My job as an intelligence analyst is to basically research and understand things that are complicated and maybe hidden, the answers to things," he said. "So what I've been doing for the past 15 years is finding the answers to difficult questions.
 "I think if there's ever a need for research for anyone on the board, (Superintendent) Jeremy (Palotti) or whoever, I'm really solid at finding things that worked for other districts or what hasn't worked, just general inquiries."
 Like many parents of school-age children during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Clarks have take on the roles of at-home teaching assistants while school buildings are closed and instruction is done through Zoom and other online forums. Clark gives Hornell high marks for its response to the crisis.
 "I think the district is doing great. I've been very impressed by the district and by both of my kids' teachers," he said. "I have friends who spend five figures a year on their kids' private schools, and it took months for their schools to come up with a plan and implement it, whereas the Hornell school district was up and running the following week, just a few days after they canceled school.
 "It's not lost on us how much time the teachers are putting into it, that's for sure, parents too."
 The June 9 school budget vote and board of education election will be held entirely through absentee balloting. Clark is the only candidate to file a petition for the unexpired term. If elected, Clark would take office immediately.
 The other board of education election is for a five-year term. Jessica Hess, who currently holds the position, is the only candidate to file a nominating petition for that board position.

Thom Mayer, the medical director of the NFL Players Association, said league engineers and sports equipment company Oakley are testing prototypes of a modified face mask that might contain surgical or N95 material.
 “I had suggested that we should consider novel and emerging ways to handle the helmets and the face masks and the spread of the virus,” Mayer said on a podcast with ESPN’s Adam Schefter. “These guys got the bit between their teeth.”
 Work on the face mask is far enough along that “there will probably be a recommendation” to use it when the league begins its preseason schedule in August, according to Mayer.
 Cleveland Browns center JC Tretter, who also serves as president of the NFLPA, welcomed any attempt to improve player safety.
 “There are no bad ideas at this point,” he said. “You kind of have to think outside the box. Just because it is an idea does not mean things are definitely going to happen, but you need to explore it and you need to understand it.”
 Falcons cornerback Isaiah Oliver withheld judgment until he’s able to check out a prototype.
 “I haven’t seen anything like that,” Oliver said Wednesday. “I would have to look into it to see what it looks like.”

Season two of _Harlots_ premieres on Hulu July 11. The drama series tells the story of English society from the perspective of prostitutes in the late 18 century. But Moira Buffini, executive producer, says the stories could stem from our current society. “Gender politics seems to be in the center of everyone’s discussions [today],” she said. “The show doesn’t shy away from really tricky stories and tricky situations.”
 She mentions how the #MeToo movement has impacted Harlots. “We’ve taken all that on board,” she said, “in our writing and our thinking.”
  _Harris’s List of Covent Garden Ladies_ , essentially a guide book about local prostitutes in London, inspired the show. “It’s all written in the most beautiful prose,” said Buffini. (Father’s Day has come and gone, but you can still pick up the book on Amazon for about six bucks.)
 Buffini describes _Harlots_ as “love, sex and death in Georgian London.” Shot in England, season one debuted in March 2017. The producers were elated with how the inaugural season landed. It being an English costume drama about the sex industry, Buffini wasn’t quite sure how Harlots would be received. “People totally got it,” she said. “I’m absolutely thrilled.”
 Season two starts with the first two episodes July 11, then a weekly release of the remaining six. Buffini promises “outrageous drama” in the sophomore season. _Harlots_ follows the Wells family, led by mother Margaret, played by Samantha Morton. When her daughter Charlotte (Jessica Brown Findlay) places herself in the home of rival Lydia Quigley (Lesley Manville), the rivalry is taken to a dangerous new level.
 Liv Tyler comes on board in season two as socialite Lady Isabella Fitzwilliam, who is drawn by Charlotte into the plot against Lydia. Buffini said she was “utterly delighted” when Tyler said she was in. Her film credits include _The Lord of the Rings_ franchise, _Armageddon_ and _The Incredible Hulk_. Lady Isabella offers a peak at the upper class. “I hope those stories add a layer to our society,” said Buffini.
 Buffini, Alison Newman, Alison Owen, Debra Hayward and Alison Carpenter are the executive producers. Buffini gives Hulu credit for being “such a good collaborator” on _Harlots_. “They just trust us to get on with it,” she said.
 She’s getting a kick out of writing for bold female characters. “It’s wonderful to write ass-kicking roles for women,” Buffini said.

"The dividend supports our shareholder value proposition by maintaining a reasonable payout as we navigate these uncertain times," he said in a statement. "More importantly, it places the company in a strong position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the market's eventual recovery."
 Eventual is the operative word. The market reaction to the rally in crude oil prices has been one of exuberance, rational or not. Economies are re-opening, manufacturing is returning, and traffic patterns indicate consumers are back on the road, as evidenced by the increase in refinery runs. EIA data last week showed US commercial crude oil inventories dipped by a half million barrels, easing fears of overflowing storage. WTI, the US benchmark for the price of oil, survived expiry without a repeat of the April dip into negative territory. But enthusiasm should be tempered. EIA data for last week showed motor gasoline product supplied, a proxy for demand, was down 33%, distillates were down 17.3% and jet fuel was down 68.5% from the same period last year.
 We are not out of the woods yet. Speaking Tuesday, Boston Fed Chief Eric Rosengren warned that a too-soon economic return could backfire.
 "It is vital that the design and timing of reductions in business restrictions not result in worse outcomes and higher unemployment over a longer period of time," he said.
 Those warnings ring true for the oil sector. Analysts observing the upstream energy sector, one in which companies such as Halliburton dominate, note that quarantine easing is not the same as a return to normal. Companies involved in routine maintenance are still operating on essential staff only. For producers, voluntary restraint and capex reductions are the soup of the day. And on maintenance, in general, many energy sector players rely on specialty valves from Italy, the European epicenter of the coronavirus lockdown.
 Beneath-the-headline sentiment about recovery in the energy sector will be put to the test on Wednesday when the Trump administration opens a two-day, online auction for drilling rights in New Mexico, the third-largest oil producer in the country. Included in the lots are small parcels of the Permian basin, where producers are already shutting wells. The number of high-bidders in a cautious market may be telling about the spending mood in these uncertain times.
