A hobbyist might find it fun to exploit an error in the election markets, but you can’t build a professional investing operation around it in the way you could with stocks or commodities or bonds.

OXFORD - A 28-year-old Webster man was allegedly under the influence of alcohol when he drove his pickup truck into a gas station convenience store, striking the counter and injuring a store clerk early Friday.


  Derikk T. McGovern of 52 Hartley St. pleaded not guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol, driving with a suspended license, negligent driving and wanton destruction of property valued at $1,200 or more. A Dudley District Court judge ordered McGovern held on $1,000 bail.


  Police went to Xtra Mart Mobil at 93 Southbridge Road (Route 20) just after midnight. The truck was completely in the store, which looked like a tornado had struck it according to the police report. The truck's tires screeched and engine revved as McGovern tried to back out of the store, police said.


  After telling McGovern to shut off the truck, an officer cleared debris from around the vehicle to get to McGovern. He appeared confused and repeatedly stated he shouldn't have been driving, police said.


  McGovern allegedly showed signs of intoxication and police took him to the station, where he failed a breathalyzer test. His blood-alcohol level was .23, nearly three times the legal limit to drive in Massachusetts.


  The store clerk complained of hip pain and was taken to a local hospital, police said.


  The crash was recorded on surveillance video. As the truck crashed into the counter, the clerk was thrown to the floor, according to police.


  The town building and wiring inspectors were notified and the store was boarded up and shut down until extensive repairs can be made.

In a 2019 speech at the Anti-Defamation League, British comedian-actor Sacha Baron Cohen attacked social media platforms for enabling the proliferation of hate speech and misinformation. He also perfectly encapsulated the purpose of his ridiculous characters like Borat, stating that he uses them to “get people to let down their guard and reveal what they actually believe, including their own prejudice.”


  For all the fun we made of Baron Cohen’s 2006 surprise hit and countlessly quoted lines like “Very nice! How much?” and “High five,” Borat is more than a mere collection of catchphrases. Underneath its green G-string shenanigans and nude male wrestling is a rather unpleasant portrait of American culture.


  14 years later, the gray-suited, mustachioed prankster returns for another cinematic illustration ahead of the 2020 presidential election, the breathlessly titled _Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan_. Expect jokes aplenty, moments that’ll leave your mouth agape, and incredible heart. Yes. Borat did some growing up, too.


  Following the first film's events, Kazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyev was sentenced to 14 years of hard labor for making Kazakhstan a global laughingstock. He’s prepared to redeem himself, however, by delivering a special gift to American Vice President “Mikhail” Pence. The plan goes south when Borat’s daughter, Tutar (Maria Bakalova, a very funny Bulgarian newcomer), stows away to America with him. This curveball changes Borat’s course of action, which is to turn his teenage offspring into a gift worthy of the vice president.


  Right there, you should know you’re in for one wild ride. While it’s not quite as crazy as the first film, save for maybe scenes involving a menstruation dance and exposing a former mayor, most situations are conversational to get a rise out of the rotten fruit of humanity.


  At the time of the first film, you needed a character like Borat to reveal people’s inner prejudices. Now those feelings are more overt. In a recent interview with _The New York Times_ , Baron Cohen said, “Racists are proud of being racists.” _Borat Subsequent Moviefilm_ highlights that in a pretty big way.


  Baron Cohen’s work will undoubtedly make you uncomfortable, laugh and ruffle some feathers. But at the end of his latest film, he’s holding up a mirror to the hatred of America. Learn from it and be pulled in by its surprisingly sweet father-daughter relationship.

Speaking on the humbling received on Friday, Dhoni said: "Whenever we did not get off to a good start it kept getting difficult for the middle order," said Dhoni during the post-match conference.

"In cricket when you are going through a tough phase, you need a bit of luck to go your way. But in this tournament, it hasn't really gone our way," said Dhoni. "Whenever you aren't doing well there can be a hundred reasons. One of the main things you ask yourself is whether you are playing to your potential.

Danny Manha      Danny Manha moved on to his next adventure on September 30, 2020, after tiring of an energy-sapping illness. A second generation Renoite born on June 21, 1949, he was known as a talented streetfighter, firefighter, union leader and rights advocate, and jack of all trades. Danny was the embodiment of American cool. He was generous, caring, and kind. He was good.      Danny was a free-thinker and his brilliant mind was fed by his natural curiosity. As a boy, this curiosity led him to his love of motorcycles. He built his first motorcycle from a bike and lawn mower motor, and at 69 years, he purchased his dream bike—a Harley Davidson, which along with his new pool table, he said he didn't get enough time to enjoy.      His curiosity about how things worked, and his ability to repurpose old items for new tasks earned him the Playa name, MacGyver—a name that he later claimed as Mobile MacGyver during his years as a handyman (Danny had many aliases, his most popular of which was Phil Mason). Danny loved tools and always had the tool for the job. A Burner since the eve of the millennium, he was featured on Burning Man TV for constructing a 35-foot interactive Art swing (The Pyramid Scheme) from radio tower legs.      An adrenaline junkie who loved the song (Don't Fear) The Reaper, Danny's favorite activities involved risk and speed. His firefighting career and his tree trimming and motorcycle riding hobbies were evidence of this. Because of his thrill-seeking nature, he never thought he would live to be 71. He nearly died twice after being shot in the chest and being buried alive. As a student at Reno High School, he considered taking a life insurance policy out for himself with his friends as beneficiaries. Danny treasured his friends, and he had many. The breakfast club was a favorite weekly gathering at the Gold Dust West Casino where he and his friends would catch up on the latest news, politics, and happenings of the world. And, of course, gamble.      Over his 23-year career with the Reno Fire Department, Danny, aka Dan, won firefighter of the year for his visionary CRUSHER, the instructional cyborg firefighter that dispatched lessons on fire safety to elementary students. A natural leader and eloquent speaker, he held offices throughout his career, worked alongside political figures like Harry Reid, and was ultimately president of the firefighters union. An eternal prankster, he kept things light at the firehouse by thinking of new tricks to pull on his crew mates.      Danny was preceded in death by his wife of 42 years, Linda Manha. They met through mutual friends one night when Linda and her friends were passing through Reno while traveling from Idaho to California. Linda said that she'd never met anyone like him. He had a heart of gold. They married at the Silver Queen Hotel in Virginia City in 1975. They began to expand their family with their first pet Liberty, who was an African grey parrot. Danny and Linda enjoyed teaching Liberty to speak, and to their amusement, Liberty would tease other pets by calling their names and then shooing them away. The couple rescued and cared for many other animals throughout the years. Gooso, an abandoned gosling they saved, became a 30-year-old neighborhood icon loved by so many. Danny and Linda also raised two children together—Justice and Andrea, who feel that growing up with Danny as a father was a uniquely wonderful experience. Every night at dinner, Danny would bring something fun and educational to the table, whether it was a trinket from his eclectic collection in the garage or something new he learned that he would turn into a game. He taught his children to be honest, treat others fairly, march to the beat of their own drum, and stand up for what they believe. When asked about what he was most proud of in his life, without hesitation, he would say it was his children.      Danny's idol was Cassius Clay—someone who was also known by different names. Whether it was conscientious objector, roofer, firefighter, union member, builder, plumber, mechanic, maker, husband, or father, Danny was first a helper. He likely would agree with Muhammad Ali who said, "service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth." During his final days, Danny looked forward admiringly at the social justice activism lighting up across the globe. He was proud that this new movement was inspired, in part, by the former quarterback of his hometown Nevada Wolf Pack, Colin Kaepernick.      Danny spent his last nine months telling his life stories and adventures to fellow Burner and girlfriend Cheryl McClure, who cared for him at home. He was a captivating story teller and listening to his stories was an experience in itself.      Daniel Joseph Manha is survived by his children Justice (Nicole) Manha and Andrea (Ethan) Jacobsma; granddaughters Joanna and Miranda Manha; his sister Carolyn Monck; many cousins, nieces, nephews, and friends. He was preceded in death by his wife Linda and his parents Joe and Nona Manha.      What's cooler than being cool? Ice cold—same way he enjoyed his favorite Coca- Cola.      Please send a memory (audio, video, written, or otherwise) that you have of Danny to danny.manha.memorial@gmail.com or his home address to share during his celebration of life, which will be held next year.

Dhoni admitted that it is necessary to don a smile despite being in pain, in order to avoid a state of panic in the toughest of circumstances.
 "Even when you are hurting you put a smile on your face so that the management doesn't look like they are in panic," Dhoni said at the post-match presentation.
 "That is what the youngsters want and I feel the boys have done that. We have kept the dressing room like that and hopefully we can turn it around in the next three games at least for pride," he added.
 Speaking on the humbling received on Friday, Dhoni said: "Whenever we did not get off to a good start it kept getting difficult for the middle order," said Dhoni during the post-match conference.
 The defeat on Friday was no isolated event, with the Chennai-based franchise finding wins hard to come by in the ongoing edition.
 CSK's defeat against MI made it three consecutive losses for the three-time champions, with the previous two coming against Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Delhi Capitals (DC).
 "In cricket when you are going through a tough phase, you need a bit of luck to go your way. But in this tournament, it hasn't really gone our way," said Dhoni.

Speaking earlier Friday after visiting a hospital in Pontoise, a suburb north of Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron said “the epidemic is very strongly accelerating.”


  The French government has expanded an overnight curfew it imposed in eight urban areas of France last week to encompass 38 more regions and Polynesia. The 9 p.m.-6 a.m. curfews and other public health measures will last for “at least six weeks,” Macron said.


  The extension means that 46 million of France’s 67 million people will be under curfews that prohibit them from being out and about during those hours except for limited reasons, such as walking a dog, travelling to and from work and catching a train or flight.

_Democracy is core to our business success, in a variety of ways. Internally, we are a famously “flat” organization -- nobody reports to anyone else, and advancement is the result of meeting well defined criteria as judged by the vote of those who have already advanced. How we compensate each other is left up to a team vote as well. Even our external business model depends on individual employees “electing” to adopt Expensify as individuals, and then “campaigning” internally to get it adopted companywide. At every layer, democracy is our core competitive advantage -- both as a company, and as a nation. But that advantage is only as strong as the clarity of our rules and the fairness of their application. Any attempt to disrupt the rules or apply them unfairly is a direct threat to the strength of our company, and the strength of our nation._

Zarezadeh was careful not to jump to conclusions about his friend's death, but urged police to take seriously the idea that it could have been politically motivated in some way.


  "I only think of the agents of the Iranian regime as his first and last enemy," he said. "That's the only thing I can think of."


  Kaveh Shahrooz, a Toronto-based lawyer and human rights activist who also knew Amin, reiterated Zarezadeh's calls for a thorough investigation, saying many in the Iranian-Canadian community are feeling unsafe.


  "I really hope that the authorities take the concerns of the community seriously. I hope they do investigate the political angle," Shahrooz said in an interview.


  "Even if it turns out to be that this was not politically motivated, I hope that our security agencies understand the fear that we live with. Because you know, we're fighting back against a regime that has no hesitation in using violence against its critics either at home or abroad."


  According to the U.S. Department of State, the Iranian regime has been responsible for "as many as 360 targeted assassinations in other countries" since coming to power in 1979.


  "Iranian diplomatic personnel have repeatedly been implicated in assassinations abroad, as evidenced by arrest warrants, judicial and police investigations, intelligence services, and witness reports," according to a May 2020 fact sheet on the State department website.

  OXFORD - A 28-year-old Webster man was allegedly under the influence of alcohol when he drove his pickup truck into a gas station convenience store, striking the counter and injuring a store clerk early Friday.


  Derikk T. McGovern of 52 Hartley St. pleaded not guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol, driving with a suspended license, negligent driving and wanton destruction of property valued at $1,200 or more. A Dudley District Court judge ordered McGovern held on $1,000 bail.


  Police went to Xtra Mart Mobil at 93 Southbridge Road (Route 20) just after midnight. The truck was completely in the store, which looked like a tornado had struck it according to the police report. The truck's tires screeched and engine revved as McGovern tried to back out of the store, police said.


  After telling McGovern to shut off the truck, an officer cleared debris from around the vehicle to get to McGovern. He appeared confused and repeatedly stated he shouldn't have been driving, police said.


  McGovern allegedly showed signs of intoxication and police took him to the station, where he failed a breathalyzer test. His blood-alcohol level was .23, nearly three times the legal limit to drive in Massachusetts.


  The store clerk complained of hip pain and was taken to a local hospital, police said.


  The crash was recorded on surveillance video. As the truck crashed into the counter, the clerk was thrown to the floor, according to police.


  The town building and wiring inspectors were notified and the store was boarded up and shut down until extensive repairs can be made.

EDMONTON - Canada and Alberta have signed a deal on caribou protection that gives them years to take action but could allow energy drilling to resume on some ranges.


  "I'm very concerned that development is in the fast lane, caribou conservation is slow," Carolyn Campbell of the Alberta Wilderness Association said Friday.


  The deal gives the two governments up to five years to design and bring in range plans for some of Alberta's most endangered herds, which rely heavily on remaining patches of undisturbed old-growth boreal forest. That same timeline applies to restoring habitat and to avoiding new disturbances.


  The plan envisions self-sustaining herds on healthy habitat some time between 50 and 100 years from now.


  Campbell and Shaun Fluker, a University of Calgary law professor who follows environmental litigation, agree the deal improves transparency on conservation moves and opens a channel for federal funding.


  But it will do little to change the immediate facts on the ground for caribou, said Fluker.


  "There's nothing new in the details of restoration and protection. It's the same techniques they're currently doing."


  Caribou conservation has been controversial in Alberta and almost every other province for years, because habitat conservation is seen to conflict with forestry, and oil and gas.


  The ranges of five of Alberta's most threatened herds are between 70 and 80 per cent disturbed. Federal guidelines for healthy caribou habitat suggest the maximum is 35 per cent.


  Despite the deal's promises to protect and restore habitat, it also contains loopholes that allow Alberta to developmore of it.


  "The agreement lacks interim habitat protection while range plan development is proposed to occur … making it likely that critical habitat disturbance and caribou extirpation risk will continue to increase in the short-term," said Campbell.


  Oil and gas drilling as well as mineral exploration may now resume on caribou ranges if it's "in alignment with woodland caribou conservation and recovery objectives," the plan says.


  Alberta had stopped selling leases on those lands, Campbell noted.


  She also pointed out the agreement, unlike an earlier draft, doesn't rule out more timber harvesting on caribou range in the short term.


  "There's definitely been concerning backsliding in forestry," she said.

Throughout Beth will battle, or give in to, alcohol and drugs — a recurring theme in Tevis’ fiction and life — beginning with the tranquilizers she’s fed at the orphanage, a kind of junior “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” situation. While key to the story, it is somewhat less convincing onscreen than the chess, because addiction is harder to play than concentration, or easier to overplay, and perhaps because it is something we have seen often in the talking pictures. There are some standard-issue intoxicated camera angles and moves, and we see Beth smoking pot and dancing to “Along Comes Mary” by the Association and drinking wine from a bottle and dancing to “Venus” by Shocking Blue. (She seems to have stolen their lead singer’s look when she arrives hungover and heavily made up to a match the next morning.)
 As to the chess, it is, of course, a compressed version of the game; there is a passage in the book where Beth takes an hour to make a move, sitting with eyes closed, and there is no way to represent it onscreen that won’t have viewers leaving the room to cook dinner or buy a car or whatever. Yet even when the play moves fast, there’s a stillness to it, and a quiet, and Frank mostly holds back on the underscoring, at least until the finale, when he lets everything rip. And even when Frank hauls out some old Hollywood effects or surgically inserts a line of cornball dialogue (“We weren’t orphans, not as long as we had each other”), it works.

VANCOUVER - Lucas Cavallini was filled with joy when he entered his home in Vancouver earlier this week and finally saw his wife and three kids in person.


  His job as the Whitecaps' top striker had kept him away for several weeks, and though the reunion with his family was brief, it was special.


  “When I walk through that door, it’s like lifting up the trophy, you know what I mean?” Cavallini said on a video call. “But I want that same feeling here with the club.”


  With just four games left on the Major League Soccer regular-season schedule, the 'Caps (7-12-0) are focused on making sure their difficult year ends on a positive note.


  Vancouver currently holds the eighth and final playoff position in the Western Conference, but the final games are all must wins if the team is going to secure its spot in the post-season, Cavallini said.


  “All this time away from home, all these sacrifices that we’re making, we have to make the best of it. I don’t want to go home with empty hands," he said.


  “At the end of the day, we’ve got to make it worth something.”


  The final stretch will kick off Saturday when the 'Caps host the San Jose Earthquakes (6-7-6) at their temporary home in Portland, Ore.


  The two clubs last met on Oct. 7 when some costly errors saw Vancouver concede a goal and go down a man early in the second half. The Earthquakes eventually handed an undermanned Whitecaps squad a 3-0 loss.


  A much different result is well within the 'Caps grasp this time out, Cavallini said.


  “If we play the game that we know how to play, we can beat this team. And not even by a close score, by a big score," said the Canadian forward, who sat out the previous matchup on a suspension. "But that depends on us.”


  The Whitecaps know that the Quakes play an unusual man marking system that creates one-on-one situations, said coach Marc Dos Santos.


  Vancouver can't be passive on defence and needs to press hard in the right moments, he added.

The number of black citizens eligible to vote in Massachusetts is 236,000, while it is 721,000 in Mississippi, more than three times that number. Therefore, according to Census officials, when looking at the estimated turnout rate in Massachusetts, the voting percentage for African-Americans at first blush is estimated at 39.3 percent. But the margin of error is 11.5 percentage points, meaning that the black voter turnout actually could be as high as 50.8 percent (or, conversely, as low as 27.8 percent).

Herbert Gates was born in Haynes on May 26, 1952, to the late Edward Gates and Maxine Adams Gates. He was the sixth child of 14 siblings.

After dating his love for many years, on June 4, 1992, Herbert married Debra Howard Gates. Together they raised two sons, Cornelius and Tyler, and a nephew/son, Nathan. Herbert loved to fish and to work on cars. He could tell you many stories about fishing and just about any problem with a vehicle.   By and by, we have met up at the call of death; and occasion that is reliably happening around us. We will weep since we will miss him so much, yet we should understand the incomparability of God's will; and we should acknowledge in confidence and anticipate the restoration of solidarity from Him to continue us in light of the fact that a great life found some conclusion on Thursday, Oct. 15, 2020, at the St. Francis Medical Hospital in Peoria.

CONCORD, Mass. (WHDH) - A headless horseman strumming some terrifying tunes while riding around Concord, Massachusetts is getting plenty of attention this Halloween season.However, Matthew Dunkle’s intention isn’t to frighten people around town, but instead to entertain.“I’ve always wanted to reach out and build community through my music, and my talent, and my enthusiasm,” Dunkle said.Dunkle says he started riding his bike in costume about five years ago as a way to deal with his grief while going through a divorce and a death in the family.His musical joy rides quickly turned into a passion project.“At first I could barely ride without taking my hands off the handlebars,” Dunkle said. “But eventually I got better and better at it.”Dunkle says he bought this costume last year, but never wore it.“I wanted to incorporate it into a musical performance. I thought it would be really wild and kind of breathtaking for people to see, running around without a head, and I got cold feet,” Dunkle said.Then in April, Dunkle dusted it off and went for a ride.“I thought it really good opportunity to bring it out because there were not a lot of cars on the road and had a lot of space to move around,” he said.But now that more people are out and about, his spook- tacular stunt is offering a fun distraction.“I’ve had so many people tell me that I bring joy and happiness and smiles,” he said.Copyright 2020 WHDH via CNN Newsource.

Danny Manha Danny Manha moved on to his next adventure on September 30, 2020, after tiring of an energy-sapping illness. A second generation Renoite born on June 21, 1949, he was known as a talented streetfighter, firefighter, union leader and rights advocate, and jack of all trades. Danny was the embodiment of American cool. He was generous, caring, and kind. He was good. Danny was a free-thinker and his brilliant mind was fed by his natural curiosity. As a boy, this curiosity led him to his love of motorcycles. He built his first motorcycle from a bike and lawn mower motor, and at 69 years, he purchased his dream bike—a Harley Davidson, which along with his new pool table, he said he didn't get enough time to enjoy. His curiosity about how things worked, and his ability to repurpose old items for new tasks earned him the Playa name, MacGyver—a name that he later claimed as Mobile MacGyver during his years as a handyman (Danny had many aliases, his most popular of which was Phil Mason). Danny loved tools and always had the tool for the job. A Burner since the eve of the millennium, he was featured on Burning Man TV for constructing a 35-foot interactive Art swing (The Pyramid Scheme) from radio tower legs. An adrenaline junkie who loved the song (Don't Fear) The Reaper, Danny's favorite activities involved risk and speed. His firefighting career and his tree trimming and motorcycle riding hobbies were evidence of this. Because of his thrill-seeking nature, he never thought he would live to be 71. He nearly died twice after being shot in the chest and being buried alive. As a student at Reno High School, he considered taking a life insurance policy out for himself with his friends as beneficiaries. Danny treasured his friends, and he had many. The breakfast club was a favorite weekly gathering at the Gold Dust West Casino where he and his friends would catch up on the latest news, politics, and happenings of the world. And, of course, gamble. Over his 23-year career with the Reno Fire Department, Danny, aka Dan, won firefighter of the year for his visionary CRUSHER, the instructional cyborg firefighter that dispatched lessons on fire safety to elementary students. A natural leader and eloquent speaker, he held offices throughout his career, worked alongside political figures like Harry Reid, and was ultimately president of the firefighters union. An eternal prankster, he kept things light at the firehouse by thinking of new tricks to pull on his crew mates. Danny was preceded in death by his wife of 42 years, Linda Manha. They met through mutual friends one night when Linda and her friends were passing through Reno while traveling from Idaho to California. Linda said that she'd never met anyone like him. He had a heart of gold. They married at the Silver Queen Hotel in Virginia City in 1975. They began to expand their family with their first pet Liberty, who was an African grey parrot. Danny and Linda enjoyed teaching Liberty to speak, and to their amusement, Liberty would tease other pets by calling their names and then shooing them away. The couple rescued and cared for many other animals throughout the years. Gooso, an abandoned gosling they saved, became a 30-year-old neighborhood icon loved by so many. Danny and Linda also raised two children together—Justice and Andrea, who feel that growing up with Danny as a father was a uniquely wonderful experience. Every night at dinner, Danny would bring something fun and educational to the table, whether it was a trinket from his eclectic collection in the garage or something new he learned that he would turn into a game. He taught his children to be honest, treat others fairly, march to the beat of their own drum, and stand up for what they believe. When asked about what he was most proud of in his life, without hesitation, he would say it was his children. Danny's idol was Cassius Clay—someone who was also known by different names. Whether it was conscientious objector, roofer, firefighter, union member, builder, plumber, mechanic, maker, husband, or father, Danny was first a helper. He likely would agree with Muhammad Ali who said, "service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth." During his final days, Danny looked forward admiringly at the social justice activism lighting up across the globe. He was proud that this new movement was inspired, in part, by the former quarterback of his hometown Nevada Wolf Pack, Colin Kaepernick. Danny spent his last nine months telling his life stories and adventures to fellow Burner and girlfriend Cheryl McClure, who cared for him at home. He was a captivating story teller and listening to his stories was an experience in itself. Daniel Joseph Manha is survived by his children Justice (Nicole) Manha and Andrea (Ethan) Jacobsma; granddaughters Joanna and Miranda Manha; his sister Carolyn Monck; many cousins, nieces, nephews, and friends. He was preceded in death by his wife Linda and his parents Joe and Nona Manha. What's cooler than being cool? Ice cold—same way he enjoyed his favorite Coca- Cola. Please send a memory (audio, video, written, or otherwise) that you have of Danny to danny.manha.memorial@gmail.com or his home address to share during his celebration of life, which will be held next year.

Respondent addressed petitioner by her formal title, and he inquired into issues related to her official business while she was in uniform and on duty in a public place near the building where she worked. The exchange was within the bounds of what is tolerated, for instance, in everyday journalism, activism, and civic engagement (regardless of whether respondent was actually engaged in such activity). In light of respondent's otherwise nonviolent words and conduct, it was not objectively reasonable to anticipate "danger" under the circumstances.
