Raffensperger said the process will have “plenty of oversight,” with both parties having the opportunity to observe.
 There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia, but state law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Biden’s lead stood at 0.28 percentage points as of Wednesday afternoon.
 Once the results from the audit are certified, the losing campaign can then request that recount, which will be done using scanners that read and tally the votes, Raffensperger said.
 U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican who’s leading Trump’s legal efforts in Georgia, called the upcoming audit a “first step.” He noted the Trump campaign had requested a hand recount.
 “This is a victory for integrity,” Collins said. “This is a victory for transparency.”
 Collins denied that Republican demands for greater scrutiny of Georgia’s vote were politically motivated to fire up GOP voters ahead of the state’s two Senate runoffs Jan. 5.
 “Look, I don’t think anybody in their right mind would think we don’t have enough attention paid on Georgia right now,” Collins said. “I don’t think motivation or turnout is a problem in Georgia.”
 The issues Trump’s campaign and its allies have pointed to are typical in every election: problems with signatures, as well as the potential for a small number of ballots miscast or lost. With Biden leading Trump by wide margins in key states, none of those issues would affect the election’s outcome.
 In addition to the audit of the presidential race, Raffensperger announced that he's consolidating runoff elections. A runoff for any state races was set to be held Dec. 1, while the runoffs for the two U.S. Senate races was set for Jan. 5. Raffensperger said he's consolidating those runoffs on Jan. 5.
 The change will not affect a Dec. 1 runoff for the special election to fill the remainder of U.S. Rep. John Lewis' term. The person who wins that election will serve for about a month before Nikema Williams, who was just elected to succeed the late Lewis, takes office. A runoff to replace Williams in the state Senate will also still be held Dec. 1.

It also doesn't hurt that some of the game's biggest names — including Edmonton's Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, Marner and Auston Matthews with Toronto, Vancouver's Elias Pettersson and Winnipeg's Patrik Laine — could be pitted against each other more often.
 "It would be a cool experience," Marner said. "We've just got to be ready for whatever happens."
 Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa usually play in the Atlantic Division, Winnipeg is in the Central, and Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary are in the Pacific.
 Senators forward Connor Brown, who was acquired from the Leafs in the summer of 2019, said he wouldn't mind facing his old club a little more often.
 "It would be interesting," he said. "It's all speculation, but it would be different."
 Canadiens winger Brendan Gallagher added that, like the bubble concept used during the restart, players have to be prepared to adapt on the fly.
 "If that is the case, an all-Canadian division, I think it would be pretty unique," he said. "Pretty neat you to get to see those other teams a little bit more and have an appreciation for what they do. And at the same time, there's a little bit of pride involved when you're playing for your Canadian division.
 "I'm sure everyone would have a little bit of motivation."

In the revamped story, Hondo and his dad, Daniel Sr., (Obba Babatundé) are shown in flashbacks that recall their experience. Later, the two clash over whether there's been progress — even with well-intentioned African Americans like Hondo on the force.
 “Ain't no easy solution when Black people are being treated like they're disposable,” the older man says bitterly, his tears flowing. The episode is framed by scenes of a protest march and concludes with a powerful recitation of Floyd's last words.
 Straight-ahead heroics aren’t slighted, as Hondo's team tracks members of a drug cartel and try to deter a terrorist attack — all in under an hour, and with fleeting acknowledgment of the pandemic. (The virus outbreak is prominent in the paired 10 p.m. episode, with the central story involving SWAT-CIA efforts to track an international crime boss.)
 Moore and Thomas said the episode had the strong support of CBS and co- producer Sony Pictures Television, but it’s also the result of having a Black star and executive producer with the motivation and authority to initiate it. Moore also is a producer for “S.W.A.T.”
 “What the show looks to do, and I’ve always looked to do as an individual, is to try to increase the types of voices that we see," Thomas said. “Not so much to eliminate the status quo that we’ve had before, but to expand the choices that a viewer has, so that you have different types of cop shows.... not just the standard that we’ve grown accustomed to.”
 It remains to be seen how viewers react to a traditional broadcast drama addressing topical issues more common to cable and streaming fare.
 Moore said that giving “S.W.A.T.” fans the thrill ride they expect is the priority but doesn't preclude offering more, and doing it in a way that respects varied perspectives.
 “I don't care who you are when you watch that show, you are moved. And to be able to entertain folks but also move them and create a conversation, a debate” is the goal, the actor said. "We don’t care what side you take, but just let us present all sides, because that’s what we need, we need more communication.”

Nov 11 (Reuters) - Im Sung-jae may be a long shot to win the Masters on his first trip to Augusta this week but the talented South Korean has already decided what will be on the menu if he becomes the first Asian to win one of golf's biggest prizes.
 As well as being fitted for the famous green jacket, the winner of the Masters also selects the menu at the traditional Champions Dinner the following year and the 22-year-old Im is keen to ensure one special dish will be on the list.
 "Marinated ribs. I feel like players of all nationalities would love that and I would of course cook them in the Korean style," Im said in a PGA Tour release.
 A trip to Augusta National offers sensory overload from the sweet-smelling azaleas to the taste of a Masters pimento cheese sandwich and Im said he was keen to soak it all up.
 "I'm not familiar with the pimento cheese sandwich, but I love all types of food, so I'm willing to give it a try," said Im, who qualified by winning the Honda Classic in March.
 "I watched this a lot as a kid. I've always dreamed of playing the Masters and it's hard to believe I'll be competing here ... It's pretty cool and I'm really looking forward to it."
 Im said that he was not setting lofty targets.
 "I would like to first make the cut. After that, I would be happy with a top-15 or top-20 finish. I hope to quickly adjust to the course and perform well," Im said.
 "I've heard from other players the winds tend to swirl ... I know the undulation on the greens will be severe ... I'll have to take all of those into consideration." (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru Editing by Robert Birsel)

“The good thing about wrestling is that it’s one-on-one, unlike basketball where you have 10 kids out there at the same time. In wrestling, it’s just one guy against the other for six minutes, it’s a pretty controlled environment.”
 Ivatts has some seven Warrior seniors who are wrestlers “and I have a few kids talking to me about wrestling at Division III (collegiately) schools, whether they think they can do it. When you think about the kids who have put in the work, three or four years here at Foxboro High, it’s hard to take that (competition) away from them. There are a lot of kids in the same position, hoping to get some looks, a lot of schools in the same position looking at kids.”
 The proposals by the wrestling coaches will be reviewed by the MIAA, but whether there will be any re-considerations is indefinite.
 At present there are a number of wrestling clubs within the state that attract high school wrestlers to compete in amateur meets where states allow such competition, such as New Hampshire and New Jersey. “There’s a big tournament down in Maryland this weekend that a lot of clubs went down to,” Ivatts said. “There are opportunities to wrestle, but it’s different.
 “It stinks, but wrestling is a different sport, the kids are all over each other. Right now, we’re not ready for wrestling, I totally get that.”
 Those one-on-one bonds that develop between student-athletes and coaches, the maturation process, the life-long relationships that are cultivated will be missed.
 “I’m disappointed because I love coaching and we have a nice program here at Norton High,” Coleman said. “In terms of our overall talent we were going to be very strong.”
 The Lancers trio of co-captains among the six seniors are 170-pounder Nick Andreason and 182 pounder Nathan Arduino, both Division 3 Meet and state meet qualifiers along with 145-pounder Johvon Morson. Add in 108-pounder Steven Chaffee, a Division 3 Meet champion and No. 3 finisher at the MIAA State Meet and 220-pounder Ray Rodriguez who qualified for the sectional and state meet and Norton would have been contending for Tri-Valley League and Division 3 Meet championships.
 “These are high level kids, maybe not nationally ranked kids, but kids who could compete in college,” Coleman said. “We’ve always been tough to beat as a result.”
 When Coleman started the wrestling program back in the winter of 2005-06, “the seniors were saying to me that if we don’t wrestle varsity, we’ll never earn a letter!” Wrestling, competing and representing their high school was indeed a very big deal for student-athletes.
 “I’ll always remember that season because we lost eight in a row, then we won our ninth and finished 11-15. In our third year, we won the league championship.”
 All of those one-on-one duals, the stepping stones to greater goals will be lost without a wrestling season.
 “I’m not too optimistic at this point, it’s a shame,” Coleman continued. “All the club tournaments will not substitute wrestling for your own high school and what that means, the dual meets, the sectionals, the states.”

Euro zone periphery govt bond yields http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr
 By Dhara Ranasinghe
 LONDON, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Germany's 10-year government bond yield rose to a two-month high on Wednesday as this week's positive news on a COVID-19 vaccine continued to boost expectations for a brighter economic outlook ahead and weigh on demand for safe-haven debt.
 European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is expected to speak at an ECB forum on central banking later this session. Her comments not expected to alter expectations for further stimulus at the ECB's December meeting.
 The general risk-on sentiment in financial markets following news on Monday that Pfizer's experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results continued to drive bonds.
 While still early days, the vaccine could be a potential game-changer for a world economy hit hard by the coronavirus. That prospect hurt German bonds, considered one of the safest assets in the world.
 The 10-year German Bund yield rose to -0.456% in early trade, its highest level in two months. It has risen almost 14 basis points so far this week and is on track for its biggest weekly jump since early June.
 Bond yields were slightly higher across the euro area. U.S. bond markets were closed for Veterans Day.
 Italy's 10-year bond yield was almost 2 bps higher on the day at 0.74%, moving away from record lows hit briefly on Monday before the Pfzier vaccine news broke.
 Still, analysts say room for further selling in euro zone bond markets is limited given expectations for further ECB stimulus and a still weak inflation outlook.
 "The scope for a further rise in yields is limited by a couple of factors. One is policy - we don't expect a central bank response to better growth conditions until inflation rises," said Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy for EMEA at State Street Global Markets.

She called the conditions in some institutions "atrocious," and said a toxic relationship between correctional officers and inmates conflicts with guards' de facto role as caregivers during the pandemic.
 Guidance from public health officials who are not familiar with prisons aggravates a deficient health-care system and translates into restrictions that "don't equate to care," Coyle said in a phone interview Wednesday.
 Her advocacy group, which works with female inmates, is calling on the federal government to release some offenders so as to allow easier physical distancing behind bars, a step she says provinces have taken more readily than Ottawa.
 She is also asking for more investment in rehabilitation programs to encourage community reintegration and prevent recidivism, paving the way for earlier releases.
 The federal prison population fell by only two per cent to about 13,700 between March and April, while the number of Canadians incarcerated at provincial and territorial institutions dropped by 25 per cent to roughly 18,200 between February and April, according to Statistics Canada.
 The changes came after Public Safety Minister Bill Blair asked the federal prison service and the parole board in March to consider releasing some inmates early to lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
 Nearly one-quarter of inmates in federal custody are serving life sentences and ineligible for parole, he said in the spring.
 But many federal prisoners have been ensnared in a catch-22 that has hindered their release, Coyle said.

All this is at the personal level. The political man, despite all his missteps, misspeaks and monstrous mendacities has turned out to be the most fascinating political performer on the American stage. He, of course, belongs only to this age at this point of time. Other periods did not create the culture in which Trumpism could triumph. It is a populist cult that combines McCarthyism with Hooverism. This duo rose and survived in the fear-driven ethos of the Cold War. In an atmosphere of fear, it is easy to sell lies. Both McCarthyism and Trumpism thrived on lies. The fear of a red under the bed enabled McCarthy to manipulate and ride the fears of the day to his political advantage. . But they remained as a marginal cult, with considerable power no doubt. Tramp also has the Mc Carthyist tendency of lying through his teeth to create fear and thrive on fears of real and imaginary foes. He also has the Hooverish iron-fist to rule the roost with vindictive terror. Above all, he had crafted a new style of politics that has thrown tried and tested conventions and formulas into the winds. He has got away with never ending lies which has reduced fact-checkers to exhausted statisticians keeping useless records. His idiosyncratic style is in a class by itself. The pundit class overloaded with Cassandras are left puzzled by each unpredictable turn of events. The latest is stunning. When he got the first whiff of losing to Biden he ordered that the polling booths should stop counting. And he added even before the count had finished: ‘We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we have won.”

Jenkins said another factor contributing to the Saints’ pass rush is improved coverage of opposing receivers early in their routes.
 “Pass rush and coverage always go hand in hand; you show me a great D-line that can get a rush on the quarterback, I’m going to show you a secondary that doesn’t give a quarterback quick options,” Jenkins said. “When we play well as a secondary, our D-line can win.”
 Saints coach Sean Payton credits defensive line coach Ryan Nielsen for the unit’s ability to work in sync even as substitutions are made to keep players fresh. Last weekend, the line thrived despite the absence of starting tackle Sheldon Rankins, who is out several weeks with a knee sprain.

It happened a month after a plane carrying the Wichita State football team crashed in Colorado, killing 31 people, including 14 players. The Shockers football program was discontinued in 1986.
 Those not on the Marshall plane have spent the last five decades dealing with heartache, self-doubt and unanswerable questions about why they were spared.
 Three players — linebacker Dennis Foley and linemen Carter and Pete Naputano — were among the living but were mistakenly listed with the victims in newspaper obituaries and hometown tributes.
 Foley, who was sitting out the 1970 season after hurting an ankle playing summer basketball, was one of several injured players who stayed in Huntington.
 After a failed attempt to reach the crash site, he returned to campus. His roommate, kicker Marcelo Lajterman, was among the dead. That night, Foley was introduced to another student who would become his wife.
 Carter had visited Texas for his father’s funeral. His mother asked him to stay a few days, and Carter obliged, missing the East Carolina trip. And yet his name remained on the passenger list. A friend who saw Carter back on campus panicked and ran screaming. He ran after her to prove he wasn’t a ghost.
 A few other injured players were told at the last minute that school boosters would take their place on the plane. Cornerback and co-captain Nate Ruffin, who died of leukemia in 2001, never learned who took his seat.
 “To this date, we didn’t know — nor did we care to find out — who got added to the trip,” Ruffin told The Associated Press in a 2000 interview.
 Instead, the players who were left behind were called upon to identify crash victims through clothing, jewelry, shoes — even scars. Ruffin became an impromptu team spokesman, answering frantic queries from players’ parents.
 There were too many funerals to attend. Six players whose bodies were never identified were buried at a nearby cemetery.
 A pall of grief and skepticism hung over a program, which had a perennial losing record in the 1960s and had been placed on NCAA probation for recruiting violations in 1969. But acting university President Donald Dedmon and others quickly decided to keep football going.
 Jack Lengyel, the coach hired in 1971 to usher Marshall into a new era, said the decision was “based on faith.”
 They started from scratch. A ragtag group that included three dozen walk-ons, former servicemen, a soccer player, basketball players and transfer students joined the few returning athletes who were not on the plane. Some returning freshmen who were not allowed to play the previous fall due to NCAA restrictions helped fill out the team.
 Ten months after the crash, in the second game of the following season, in what is still considered the biggest victory in program history, Marshall defeated Xavier, 15-13, at home by scoring a touchdown on the final play. Freshman fullback Terry Gardner caught a screen pass from Reggie Oliver and went 13 yards for the score.
 Fans stormed the field in celebration.
 Lengyel, now 86, gives talks to residents of the Maryland senior facility where he lives after showings of the film in which he is portrayed by Matthew McConaughey.
 “The Marshall people are like a fist,” Lengyel said. “They support their athletic programs, and they always did. In the time of tragedy, they came together like a fist. They believed in the program and brought it from the ashes to the glory."

AUGUSTA, Ga., Nov 10 (Reuters) - Phil Mickelson no longer comes to Augusta thinking about winning the Masters and would be happy just to be in contention for another Green Jacket, the three-times champion said on Tuesday.
 Splitting his time between the PGA and Champions Tours and a decade removed from his last Green Jacket, Mickelson spent as much time during his pre- Masters news conference reliving past glories and speculating about the future as discussing the present.
 Playing in his 28th Masters there is certainly plenty to reflect on for the 50-year-old fan favourite, who also took a moment to ponder the idea of one day taking over the ceremonial starter role with long time rival Tiger Woods from Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player.
 While Mickelson has found his winning touch on the seniors circuit, winning two events, "Lefty" has not found similar success at the this year's two majors, failing to make the cut at the U.S. Open and finishing in a tie for 71st at the PGA Championship.
 His best result in four events on the 2021 PGA Tour was a tie for 44th.
 Yet form is not always the key barometer when it comes to the Masters where Mickelson has rarely been out of contention.
 In 27 Masters appearances he has won three Green Jackets, the same number of times he has missed the cut.
 Since his last win in 2010 he has finished runner-up in 2015 and in a tie for third in 2012.
 "I like that feeling about this golf course that you don't have to be perfect," said Mickelson. "There's something very spiritual about this place as a golfer, and to have won this tournament means a lot to me.
 "I can't believe it's been 10 years since I won it last.
 "I would love nothing more than to have an opportunity to be in contention, and that's my goal.
 "I'm not going into this event thinking about winning. I'm going into this event thinking about trying to get into contention for the weekend and then hopefully take it from there." (Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto. Editing by Toby Davis)

Como havia sido prometido, a Niantic e a Game Freak conectaram _Pokémon Go_ a _Pokémon HOME_ , o que significa que agora você poderá transferir seus Pokémon de _Go_ para o serviço de armazenamento _HOME_.
 A preparação para transferir Pokémon é simples, conforme o esperado, e foi implementada em _Go_ uma taxa de energia para usar o Transportador de _HOME_.
 Será preciso conectar sua conta do jogo _Pokémon Go_ à sua conta Nintendo para ter acesso a _HOME_ , e isso pode ser feito nas Configurações do app de _Go_. A partir dali, as transferências começam em _Go_ e são concluídas em _HOME_ usando a mesma conta.
 Nenhum Pokémon que for transferido de _Go_ para _HOME_ poderá ser enviado de volta ao jogo mobile, então tenha certeza de que só está enviando os Pokémon que realmente quiser transferir.
 Os Pokémon que estiverem defendendo ginásios, Pokémon Sombrosos não- purificados e Mega Pokémon não poderão ser transferidos. Se você tiver um Pokémon com uma roupa ou visual especial, o que parece é que ele poderá ser transferido, mas perderá o visual especial em _HOME_.
 Toda transferência usará Energia do Transportador, que poderá ser recuperada com o tempo. Você começa com 10.000 Energias do Transportador e recupera 60 energias por hora.
 Você pode transferir diversos Pokémon por vez, não apenas um, apesar do custo de energia. Também há a opção de recarregar completamente a Energia do Transportador usando PokéMoedas: as 10.000 energias custam 1.000 PokéMoedas.
 Inicialmente, o recurso fica disponível apenas para os treinadores de nível 40, enquanto a Niantic faz seus testes. Aos poucos, ele será distribuído para todos os níveis.

Given what we know about Donald Trump, it’s futile to urge him to accept defeat gracefully and put the welfare of the country above the gratification of his bruised ego. Nor would there be much point in calling on an incorrigibly dishonest president to stop serving up conspiracy theories about a rigged election. This, after all, is the man who made baseless allegations about voter fraud in the 2016 election because he couldn’t accept losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.
 But it’s important to call out other public officials who are enabling the president in his divisive denial of reality. They include Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and, surprisingly, the head of the General Services Administration, who has declined so far to authorize full cooperation with Joe Biden’s transition team. Her stance has allowed the rest of the administration to keep the transition on ice.
 Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said Tuesday that Trump “may not have been defeated.” In more anodyne comments, McConnell said Trump’s legal challenges were “not unusual” and are “no reason for alarm.” Similarly, McCarthy told Fox News on Sunday that “what we need in the presidential race is to make sure every legal vote is counted, every recount is completed and every legal challenge should be heard. Then, and only then, America will decide who won the race.”

 VILNIUS, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Lithuania's capital Vilnius is preparing to set up a 700-bed makeshift hospital in its largest exhibition centre, as the city fears its health system may soon get overloaded by coronavirus cases.
 Lithuania reported 1,433 new cases on Tuesday, bringing its total so far to 28,262 cases and 235 deaths. The number of daily cases has increased tenfold from a month ago.
 The town is launching tenders to buy oxygen equipment and beds, and is recruiting medical staff to work at the hospital. It will take six weeks to set up, Povilas Poderskis, head of city administration, told reporters.
 "We really hope the situation will not get so bad that we actually need the facility", he said. "It's better to be prepared even if we don't need it, than to be unprepared when we need it."
 The city has plans to increase the total number of beds in existing hospitals for treating COVID cases to about 350, at a cost of reducing regular medical services, he said. Hospitals in Vilnius were treating 88 coronavirus patients on Wednesday.
 The Litexpo exhibition centre is the largest in the Baltic states region. The three halls considered for the hospital have a total area of 6,700 square meters, according to its website.
 Lithuania's government declared a three-week lockdown on Nov. 6. The agrarian- led government is serving out the end of a lame duck term after losing an Oct. 25. general election, and a new centre-right government is due to take office in coming weeks.

Following Democrat Joe Biden’s victory, Trump has sought to discredit the integrity of the election and argued without evidence that the results will be overturned. Republican lawmakers have said the president should be allowed to launch legal challenges, though many of those lawsuits have already been turned away by judges and those that remain do not include evidence of problems that would change the outcome of the race.
 In Wisconsin, a battleground state where Biden narrowly edged Trump, top election official Meagan Wolfe said there were no problems with the election reported to her office and no complaints filed alleging any irregularities.
 Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, said the same was true in her state, which Biden also won.
 “Let me be clear — the November elections in Michigan ran as smoothly as ever,” Nessel said, adding that there were no “instances of irregularities in the process of counting the votes, only evidence-free allegations, wild speculation, and conspiracy theories.”
 Ahead of Election Day, the pandemic upended longstanding voting plans and forced election officials to make systemic changes largely on the fly. They did so with limited federal money to cover increased costs for mail ballots, which take more staff and money to send, process and count.
 After problems erupted during spring primaries, the nation worried whether election officials could pull off a problem-free presidential election during a pandemic while confronting the threat of foreign interference from sophisticated adversaries led by Russia.
 “In the spring, there were just so many challenges we were facing, and we were just wondering how we were going to manage to do it,” said Larry Norden, an elections expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. “It’s an incredible story.”
 Long before a single ballot was cast, Trump raised questions about the integrity of the election and railed against mail voting despite a long history of mail ballots being used successfully in this country. At one point, he claimed the only way he could lose was if the election were rigged.
 Some states that expanded mail-in voting to make it safer to cast a ballot during the virus outbreak lean Republican and voted for Trump — Nebraska, North Dakota and Montana. He has raised no concerns about the results there.
 On Monday, Attorney General William Barr authorized federal prosecutors across the U.S. to probe “substantial allegations” of voting irregularities.
 The groundless claims pushed by Trump and his allies about voting and ballot counting have only intensified since The Associated Press and other news organizations called the race Saturday for Biden, who leads in both the popular vote and in the Electoral College.
 Among the many lawsuits filed since Election Day is one in Nevada by the Trump campaign alleging voter fraud. Without explanation, Trump tweeted that the state is “turning out to be a cesspool of Fake Votes.”
 Such claims have put pressure on Republican election officials fielding scores of reports of fraud that so far have turned out to be human error or limited in scope.
 Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, said her office wouldn’t quantify how many complaints it had received, adding, “Many voter fraud complaints lack any evidence and are more complaints about process or policy.”
 In Iowa, Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, ordered all counties in the state to double-check results after a data entry error was discovered in one precinct.
 “These human errors are unfortunate and frustrating, but the system is working,” he said.
 On Monday, Georgia’s two U.S. senators, both Trump supporters facing close runoff elections that could determine which party controls the Senate next year, called on the state’s top election official, a fellow Republican, to resign over unspecified claims of election mismanagement.
 The official, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, said he would not step down and assured the public there had been no widespread problems.
 “Was there illegal voting? I’m sure there was, and my office is investigating all of it,” Raffensperger said. “Does it rise to the numbers or margin necessary to change the outcome to where President Trump is given Georgia’s electoral votes? That is unlikely.”
 Studies have repeatedly shown that voter fraud is exceptionally rare.
 Much of Trump’s ire has centered on Pennsylvania, where the campaign has launched multiple lawsuits despite no indications of fraud or large-scale problems.
 “On Election Day, we didn’t have any reports of anything significant,” said Lisa Schaefer, who leads the bipartisan County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania. “We have every reason to have confidence in the result of this election, as we do every other election.”

 Nov 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Nearly a decade has passed since Safiya Noble googled "Black girls" and found the search results were mostly pornographic - a discovery that drove her to explore how algorithms can perpetuate discrimination and inequality.
 Google went on to fix that search engine issue, but Noble said the problem is far from solved. Research this year found Google's advertising platform linked the search phrases "Black girls," "Latina girls," and "Asian Girls" to adult content ads.
 "The Black girl search is the thread on the sweater we are trying to unravel. It's a way into a larger conversation about the future of knowledge," said Noble, who will speak on a digital rights panel at the Thomson Reuters Foundation's annual event, Trust Conference, being held online on Wednesday.
 Noble, a leading technology scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), went on to coin the term "algorithms of oppression" and has written a book with the same name.
 "Algorithms of oppression are everywhere," she said. "I'm talking about computational software that might be embedded in large-scale platforms - or even household brands - that are used to disenfranchise, marginalize, and misrepresent."
 That Google's search engine had been built to assume those looking for information about Black girls were interested in pornography "reinforced misrepresentations," Noble said.
 Cathy Edwards, vice president of engineering at Google Images, said that because the company's systems "are organizing information from a constantly- changing web, our results can sometimes show negative stereotypes."
 But she added in emailed comments that Google was "committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do — from how we build our products to how we build our workforce."
 GREATER DIVERSITY
 Beyond search engines, Noble said she was also concerned about algorithms used in a whole suite of technologies - from predictive policing software to facial recognition tools, or social media platforms that accelerate disinformation.
 These technologies not only tend to single out minorities for unfair treatment, but also provide little recourse for them to seek redress.
 "(These technologies) are particularly deployed towards vulnerable people oftentimes communities of color, poor people, and people who are the least empowered to resist," she said.
 Greater diversity in the technology industry would help, she said, but would not erase the harm technology can do to vulnerable groups.
 "You can't see the flaws in your system when you have a fairly homogeneous group of designers, who are designing for a diverse set of societies around the world, and communities," she said.
 "We know that every year Silicon Valley says it's going to get more diverse. But there's no improvement, even though for 10 years we've been gathering more evidence about the harms of their products."
 Noble applauds renewed public interest in scrutinizing and putting pressure on technology platforms, the so-called "techlash" that set in after the 2016 U.S. election.
 Technology scholars, researchers and journalists are making an increasing effort to track how Facebook facilitates the spread of disinformation and contributes to a polarized electorate, she said.
 Noble belongs to the "Real Facebook Oversight Board", a group of academics and activists established to question the social media network's policies and content moderation decisions in the run-up to this month's U.S. election.
 Facebook did not reply to a request for comment about the Board, but in September a spokesman said it was "mostly longtime critics creating a new channel for existing criticisms".
 Noble also welcomed potential government intervention to reduce the power of tech firms.
 "When you have a monopoly advertising company controlling the information landscape you have a recipe for disaster," she said. "Large tech companies prioritize their own profit at all costs.
 "Who pays the price? We know it's people who are less capitalized and minoritized, that's just a fact." (Reporting by Avi Asher-Schapiro @AASchapiro; Editing by Helen Popper.

“It will be a heavy lift, but we will work with the counties to get this done in time for our state certification," Raffensperger said, flanked by local election officials on the steps of the state capitol. “We have all worked hard to bring fair and accurate counts to assure that the will of the voters is reflected in the final count and that every voter will have confidence in the outcome, whether their candidate won or lost."
 Georgians cast nearly 5 million votes in the presidential race and counties have until Friday to certify their results.
 Georgia’s two U.S. senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, earlier this week called on fellow Republican Raffensperger to resign over unspecified claims of election mismanagement. Both face close runoff elections in January that will determine which party controls the Senate. Raffensperger said he wouldn't step down and assured the public there had been no widespread problems.
 The audit is a new requirement put in place by a law passed in 2019 that also provided for the new voting machines purchased last year. The state has chosen to do a risk-limiting audit, which involves checking a random sample of ballots by hand against results produced by vote-tallying equipment for accuracy. In such audits, the smaller the margin between candidates in a race, the larger the sample of ballots that must initially be audited.
 Raffensperger said the tight margin means that the audit will effectively result in a full hand recount.
 Asked if he chose the presidential race because of the Trump campaign's call for a hand recount, Raffensperger said, “No, we're doing this because it's really what makes the most sense with the national significance of this race and the closeness of this race.”
 For the audit, county election staffers will work with the paper ballots in batches, dividing them into piles for each candidate. Then they will run the piles through machines to count the number of ballots for each candidate. The scanners will not read the data on the ballots, but will simply count them.
 The secretary of state's office has said that any time ballots are recounted, the outcome is likely to be slightly different. If the vote tallies differ from what was previously recorded by the counties, it is the results of the audit that will be certified by the state.
 Chris Harvey, the elections director in the secretary of state's office, said the agency will have a call with county election officials Thursday to go over training requirements and expectations. He said counties will likely begin the audit process that afternoon or Friday morning.

Set up a dedicated journal or file to detail your daily highlights. As you end your workday, take a few minutes to review your successes. Even if you did not close the sale, get the client, or finish your pitch as planned, dig deeper to unearth what you did do that got you traction, perhaps even a new direction. Validate positive actions and small wins instead of seeking perfect pre-set results. Once a month, review your daily list of successes.

RHODE ISLAND – It’s been a historic election on many fronts, but Rhode Island earned its place in the history books this year for being the first state to change its official name.
 After years of debate, and an entire decade since Rhode Islanders last weighed in on this issue, the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations will simply be known as just Rhode Island.
 Rep. Anastasia Williams (Dist. 9 — Providence), who helped introduce a resolution to have this item placed on the ballot, said she was elated to learn the results early this morning. When she’d gone to bed only a few hours earlier, before all the votes had been counted, she’d thought the question had been narrowly defeated.
 When she awoke, Williams was greeted by messages of congratulations.
 “I got energized immediately,” Williams said, joyfully. “I got a surge, and I was like ‘Yes, baby!’”
 “We all did it together,” she added. “We can say one Rhode Island.”
 Sen. Harold Metts (Dist. 6 — Providence), who also introduced a resolution to help place this item on the ballot, also went to bed on Election Night, thinking the question would be narrowly defeated. He too, was woken up to messages of congratulations.
 “I’m very grateful – especially given the toxic climate that we’re in and the negativity that’s swirled this whole election – that people showed compassion for how the African-American community feels about the horrors of the past,” Metts said.
 The history of slavery and inhuman treatment of the African-American community has largely been ignored, he said, as well as the role Rhode Island played in the slave trade.
 “To see it pass, and to see people show compassion for other people, it really says a lot about people,” Metts said. “I just thank God for that type of spirit, because we’re certainly gonna need that spirit as the country moves forward.”
 “We need healing,” he continued, “and perhaps that’s a small part of the healing that’s needed. We can’t change the past, but we can certainly make amends as we move into the future.”
 Though he wasn’t sure of where Rhode Islanders would come to stand on the issue, Metts said he’d been anticipating a tight vote this time around. When he went to bed on Election Night, thinking that the question would be defeated once again, he was still encouraged to see how much public opinion and awareness had improved over the past decade.
 Although there had been some efforts to educate Rhode Islanders on the history and atrocities of slavery in this country, especially right here in the Ocean State, Williams said the message didn’t take root last time around in 2010.
 When Rhode Islanders were asked if they’d like to strike “and Providence Plantations” from the official state name ten years ago, the question was overwhelmingly defeated. But despite 77.9 percent of voters deciding against the change in 2010, proponents of the measure believed a nationwide reckoning with racial injustice will sway the vote the other way.
 While the question was approved by voters this time around, the margin for victory was slim. The difference of 29,058 votes, decided the fate of the race.
 Until mail and emergency ballots were accounted for, early polling numbers indicated that Rhode Islanders would once again decide against the abbreviation. Of those who showed up to the polls on Election Day, only 75,727 voters were in favor of the change, compared to 97,400 voters who didn’t want to see the abbreviation.
 This difference of 29,058 votes was eclipsed, however, once all the ballots were counted.
 More than 126,000 Rhode Islander voted by emergency ballot at their town or city halls over the past several weeks, though the decision among emergency voters was much more closely divided. A difference of 2,789 Rhode Islanders were in favor of the abbreviation, compared to those who would have liked to see the original name remain in place.
 The vast majority of mail voters were in favor of the change, however. According to voting data from the Rhode Island Board of Elections, as of Wednesday morning, 92,125 Rhode Islander were in favor of dropping “and Providence Plantations” from the official state name – nearly double the number of mail voters, 48,103, who’d hoped to keep the full name.
 By the following Wednesday morning, after more votes had been counted, 102,363 Rhode Island mail voters were in favor of the change – compared to the 54,421 who'd been in favor of rejecting the abbreviation.
 Though the full, official state name had hardly ever been used, many who’d been against the change viewed the measure as erasing part of the state’s history, and others have pointed out that the word plantation carried a very different meaning in the 17th Century, compared to today.
 “When people hear that word plantation, it brings us back,” Williams had said during an online community conversation with Lt. Gov. Dan McKee ahead of Election Day. “It brings many of us back to that place. By reading and knowing our history — not black history, [but] American history — it brings you to a time that you don’t want to live again.”
 While many may not be comfortable discussing it, or may not acknowledge it, Rhode Island played a considerable role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, according to Williams. Recent tragedies, such as the death of George Floyd, have sparked discussions of racial injustice all over the country and have breathed new life into the discussion of the official state name.
 Heading into Election Day, Williams had said “how we have to look at this if we lose, is we still won.” Williams said she was both surprised and not surprised by how closely the question had been determined. Compared to a decade ago, public education on the issue was greatly improved.
 “There was no history, no teaching, no conversation,” Williams said. “This time, when I took the lead, I said ‘It’s got to be more than an initiative to put it on the ballot. We have to educate the public.’”
 She believes events that have highlighted racial inequalities within our society, such as the pandemic and Floyd’s death, are a large part of the reason Rhode Island wasn’t operating “business as usual.”
 “People need to start getting comfortable getting uncomfortable,” she said. “We’re certainly moving in the right direction. Finally, moving in the right direction.”
 “People were more willing to listen, people were more willing to talk about it,” she added.

McGraw is the star of the Elkhart defense. The 6-6, 251-pound end has 78 tackles. The Penn State commit also has an eye-popping 21 tackles for loss to go with eight sacks.
 “It feels awesome to do this in the first year of Elkhart High School,” McGraw said. “I saw it coming. All of us just clicked right away and we have guys who were willing to work.
 “People are always going to look at the offense. But we know that it takes defense to win games too. And our coaches know that too. That’s good enough for us.”
 Ambrose admits that he was not sold at first on the merger between the city rivals.
 “I’m a guy who wanted it to stay Central and Memorial,” Ambrose related. “I grew up that way. But I’m glad it happened. From that first day together in the weight room something clicked. I put that on our coaches for how good our chemistry is.
 “We’ve got a team that does not want to lose. Some of us have been playing together since like third or fourth grade. And the Memorial guys on the team are big time players. We just have to continue to play well, play together and just be Elkhart.”
 The Lions are also thankful to be one of just eight teams left in Class 6A. They had their season opener versus Concord canceled due to the pandemic and also had a huge Northern Indiana Conference showdown with fellow unbeaten Marian called off due to contact tracing within the Marian program.
 “It’s been an awesome season, but it will not settle in on how special it was until it’s done,” Shattuck said. “I’m not surprised that we are undefeated. We felt really good about this team. We had nine wins last year (at Central) and some of the Memorial guys are the best we have.
 “It’s been humbling to play in a pandemic. I’ve said all along that the benefits of playing outweigh the risks of not for these kids when the protocols are taken seriously and we have done that.”
 Merrillville averages 38 points-per-game and allows 12. The Pirates lone loss was to Class 3A No. 1 Chatard 45-28 and they beat No. 3 Lafayette Jefferson, 48-14, last Friday night. Former Warsaw star Brad Seiss is in his sixth season as the Merrillville head coach.
 Shattuck, who was 19-15 in three years at Central previously, knows the challenge that lies in front of his talented team Friday night.
 “We will need to put together our best game of the season in all three phases of the game,” said Shattuck. “We’ve played some very good teams, but this one is a different deal.
 “We have good players too though. I like our team.”

Under the law, protesters will not be allowed within 150m of an abortion clinic and aims to protect patients and workers from harassment when seeking or providing abortion care. Up until now, SA was only one of two Australian jurisdictions without safe access zones and Western Australia — being the other state — are currently debating their related laws. The legislation — which was introduced by Greens MLC Tammy Franks in the Upper House — was passed by the Legislative Council on Wednesday night. “What a relief it is that patients and health workers will no longer be subjected to this behaviour, and will be protected by our laws. “Abortion care is health care, and this legislation takes us one step towards finally treating it as such.” The new laws come with tough penalties. Anyone found to be in breach of the protest laws faces a maximum penalty of $10,000 or 12 months jail. For those in NSW, where the bill was passed in 2018, people who engage in prohibited conduct within the 150m zone can be fined up to $5000 and/or jailed for up to six months for a first offence. Similarly, Victoria, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Tasmania also have a 150m zone while in the ACT, only 50m is allocated. Tasmania was the first Australian jurisdiction to establish laws surrounding safe access zones in 2014. Other jurisdictions followed with the ACT in 2015, Victoria the following year, the Northern Territory the year after and Queensland in 2018.

Write out what is bothering you. Put it down on paper allowing yourself to pour whatever emotion you are feeling into the paper. And if you need to, be totally un-politically correct! No one is going to read this – not even you. The act of getting it out onto the paper removes the energy from your body which is a great first step. Then (safely) burn the paper. Fire transforms energy and it helps you feel the relief of letting go whatever it was that is bothering you. It helps bring harmony back into your life.

Following a game update later this year, players will also get to choose from two options in the video options, letting them continue to play the above on 'Quality' mode or switch to a 'Performance' mode where the game will run at 70% of full 4k resolution but at 120FPS. On Xbox Series S it's largely the same, although of course only at that console's maximum setting of a 1080p resolution with the same options of 60FPS with HDR at launch and a 120FPS Performance mode coming down the line.

 KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The United Nations' refugee agency said Malaysia has not allowed it to meet detained refugees and asylum seekers for more than a year as the country cracks down on undocumented migrants, raising concerns over the status of vulnerable people.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) previously visited the centres in order to determine who should be given refugee status and allowed to leave, but Malaysia's government has toughened its stance on immigration this year.
 Thousands of undocumented foreigners have been rounded up in what authorities say are efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus, and the state-funded National Human Rights Commission said it was concerned about overcrowding in the lockups.
 Malaysia's immigration department, which runs the detention centres, did not respond to requests for comment. The home ministry did not have an immediate comment.
 The UNHCR told Reuters on Wednesday that it had not been allowed to visit the centres since August 2019. It did not say why, citing ongoing discussions.
 "This has unfortunately prevented UNHCR in seeing detained persons of concern in order to determine those in need of international protection and to advocate for their release," UNHCR told Reuters in emailed comments on Wednesday.
 "We are aware and concerned that there remains in detention a number of persons of concern, including vulnerable individuals, requiring our attention."
 Malaysia is home to millions of undocumented foreigners and over 100,000 Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in Myanmar and from camps in Bangladesh. Although Malaysia does not recognise refugees, it allows free movement to those given protection by the UNHCR.
 The agency was able to register 6,039 individuals as asylum seekers by October this year compared with 27,323 through all of 2019, the agency said. Among those it had not been able to see were hundreds of Rohingya arrested after months at sea.
 "Refugees and asylum seekers like Rohingya have no opportunity to be released without the UNHCR," said Jerald Joseph, a commissioner with the National Human Rights Commission.
 Joseph estimated that over 1,000 asylum seekers were in detention camps, which he believed were now home to a third more people than the 12,500 they had been built for. The others in the lockups are undocumented foreigners awaiting deportation.
 COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported from at least five of the detention centres and over 1,000 have been affected in these clusters.
 Rights groups and detainees have said the conditions in the detention camps were brutal.
 Last month, Indonesia's Sovereign Migrant Workers Coalition cited former detainees as saying they had been treated like animals and hosed down with disinfectant after a COVID-19 outbreak.
 One former detainee, an Indonesian woman who was released in January, told Reuters hundreds of detainees were tightly packed in a room, including the old, sick, pregnant women and children. Food was inadequate and an official hit the detainees, she added.
 "It was like all the detainees in the immigration detention centre were not humans," she said.
 Authorities have in the past acknowledged that conditions at the migrant lockups could be improved.

The most important question of the day is: “How will you and I choose to go on from here?” It’s pretty clear what will happen if we choose gloating and/or vengeance, and become more partisan and/or lose faith in democracy altogether. Liberals or conservatives who radicalize, give up or become oppositional- defiant disrupters only contribute to the escalation of a dangerously partisan civil war as it spills out into the streets, our consciousness and our government.
 Choosing, instead, to allow the courts to determine any evidence of electoral wrongdoing, evaluate whether it is enough to change the results of the election, and support the transition of power if it isn’t, will help our nation find its path forward, and will, hopefully, be enough to help us all turn the page. And having worked with literally thousands of individuals and families who have suffered traumatic losses, I know that it takes time and care to process our feelings and begin healing.
 We are a great democracy in the middle of a bold historic experiment. Let’s take some time to decompress and recover from the stress of this excruciatingly vitriolic election and give others a chance to do the same. Let’s work together to end this COVID-19 pandemic by staying safe and standing strong in our resolve to set the table for America’s best possible future. De- escalating America’s 2020 civil war when and wherever possible, restoring some modicum of trust and giving our president-elect and vice president-elect a chance to succeed will help create a more perfect union. By doing what’s best for America, we will rise up to meet the challenges of the day. Not only that, but we will inspire our current president and his administration to follow suit.
 It’s time for all of us to do what’s right — starting now!

The Cleveland Browns activated quarterback Baker Mayfield from the reserve/COVID-19 list on Wednesday, allowing him to return to team facilities for practice ahead of Sunday's game against the Houston Texans.
 Mayfield was added to the list on Sunday after he was found to be in close contact with a non-coaching staff member who tested positive the day before.
 The Browns had a bye last week and the only practice Mayfield missed was on Monday, though coach Kevin Stefanski says Mayfield was involved in virtual calls and will watch tape of Monday's session.
 "We'll watch it with him," said Stefanski. "Anytime you're not out there, you wish you had all of your guys out there to get the reps -- that's just natural -- but we'll make sure we bring him up to speed as soon as he's back in the building."
 Cleveland (5-3) hosts the Texans on Nov. 15. The Texans (2-6) are coming off a win over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.
 Mayfield, 25, has started every game this season and thrown for 1,514 yards with 15 touchdowns and seven interceptions.
 The Browns have not had a player test positive since training camp opened in August.

Coziness and candles go hand in hand. There is something about the sound of burning wax along with the heat coming out of the tiny fire that makes any room feel much more comfortable and relaxing. You can get real wax candles and place them on tables at night to make the living room even warmer, or you can invest in some fake candles and have them scattered around the room to give that illusion of warmth. The great thing about candles, real or fake, is that they are really cheap and energy-efficient, so you would not have to worry about spending too much money. If it’s affordable, buy fragrance candles, adding ambience to the warmth of the room. It would be much better to get fake candles in different colors if you have any children or pets to be safe and avoid any risks.

We may yet avoid the country-destroying scenario where state legislatures start invalidating their own residents’ votes and awarding Trump their electors on an inch-thin pretense of fraud.

A Niantic e a Game Freak lançaram oficialmente a opção de transferir Pokémon do jogo _Pokémon Go_ para o app _Pokémon HOME_ , mas há alguns detalhes importantes que você precisa saber.
 Primeiro, será preciso conectar sua conta de _Pokémon Go_ à sua conta Nintendo para ter acesso ao _HOME_. Isso poderá ser feito nas Configurações de _Go_ , e a opção deve aparecer quando você abrir o app pela primeira vez depois da atualização.
 Toda transferência usará Energia do Transportador, que pode ser recuperada com o tempo. Você começa com 10.000 Energias do Transportador e recupera 60 energias por hora.
 Você também pode gastar PokéMoedas para recarregar o Transportador, mas o custo é alto. Além disso, vários Pokémon podem ser transferidos por vez, apesar de o custo de alguns Pokémon também ser alto.
 Certos Pokémon também não poderão ser transferidos de _Go_ para _HOME_ , enquanto outros perderão suas formas especiais ao serem transferidos. Nenhum Pokémon que você transferir de _Go_ para _HOME_ poderá ser transferido de volta, então sempre confira se está enviando os Pokémon certos.
 Por enquanto, apenas os jogadores de nível 40 em _Go_ podem utilizar o Transportador de _HOME_ , mas só porque o recurso é novo.
 A Niantic vai distribuir o novo recurso aos poucos, dependendo dos níveis dos jogadores, como já fez com outras atualizações antes. O objetivo é garantir que o Transportador de _HOME_ esteja funcionando corretamente quando for distribuído para todos os usuários.

Trudeau suggested the government is watching to see how things play out before deciding on its next move.
 Speaking at a virtual event hosted by the Financial Times, Trudeau said just because aid programs are helping during the pandemic doesn't mean they'll be useful once the crisis passes.
 He also said the extra benefits likely won't stick around.
 "Let's not pretend that something that works right now … gives us stability," Trudeau said in the pre-recorded interview.
 "That's not a measure that we can automatically continue in a post- pandemic world. I think there are really important reflections to have on how we provide income supports and how we make sure that everyone is given opportunities."
 The Canada Emergency Response Benefit paid out $81.6 billion to about 8.9 million people during its run from March to October.
 Since then, the three benefit programs that replaced it have paid out nearly $2.3 billion, with the majority going to the more than one million people who have used the Canada Recovery Benefit for those out of work. The number of recipients has steadily risen, and has now exceeded federal estimates for demand.
 The three "recovery" benefits will be in place until next summer.
 At the same time, a slowdown in the number of employment insurance claims suggests demand for those benefits may fall short of the 2.8 million officials previously estimated.
 All that could change, depending on the path of the pandemic.

 Nov 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Half a million reusable masks, 123 tonnes of soap and 1,750 hand-washing stations. These numbers are music to the ears of business consultant James Irungu Mwangi - telling the story of the efforts he led to protect Kenyan slum-dwellers from COVID-19.
 They also show how socially minded businesses can thrive in times of crisis, said Mwangi, who for years has urged African firms to look beyond profit and tackle issues like poverty and climate change by working with governments and non-profits.
 The coronavirus pandemic has driven many firms to do just that, he said, describing the health crisis as an opportunity for companies to reassess their priorities.
 "Businesses used to write a cheque to make a problem go away," said Mwangi, executive director of the Dalberg Group and a partner with Dalberg Advisors.
 "Now they realise if they don't respond - help people fight the disease, preserve the planet - they won't exist next quarter," said Mwangi, a speaker at the Thomson Reuters Foundation's annual event, Trust Conference, being held online on Wednesday.
 COVID-19 has already forced businesses to abandon harmful practices long considered essential, like frequent air travel, triggering discussions about the role companies should play in building better societies and more inclusive economies.
 When the outbreak hit Africa in March, many feared the disease would tear through the continent's packed slums and overwhelm fragile health systems.
 Mwangi marshalled Kenyan companies, NGOs, community groups and government bodies - players that rarely worked together but now had a common goal - in confronting the pandemic.
 Out of the collaboration came Safe Hands Kenya, a campaign to supply vulnerable Kenyans, many living in Nairobi's slums, with soap, masks and hand- washing stations manufactured locally to protect jobs.
 "We launched in crisis mode," he said. "Digital retailers, soap manufactures, media companies, and grassroots groups from informal settlements all piled in and asked 'what can we do?'"
 Mwangi convinced rival companies to share the locations of thousands of road- side stores in Nairobi where free hand-washing stations were installed.
 The Safe Hands team mapped out kiosks across the city to identify neighbourhoods cut off from sanitation.
 "It was a brutal death march of very late nights and some (of the companies) fought like cats and dogs. But it was this huge systemic shock of the pandemic that ultimately shifted mindsets," he said.
 'VIRTUOUS CIRCLE'
 Safe Hands Kenya has provided more than 1.5 million Kenyans with access to hand-washing facilities and reached a further 3 million through a social media campaign - Tiba Ni Sisi or "We Are The Cure", which encouraged social distancing.
 Fewer people have died of COVID-19 in Africa than initially feared, and the continent has registered roughly 35,000 deaths and 1.4 million confirmed cases, according to Reuters data.
 Experts say some COVID-19 deaths are probably going unregistered, but that expertise in epidemic control from tackling other outbreaks as well as outdoor living and lower rates of travel could be helping Africa fare better.
 Businesses are also playing their part in tackling the pandemic and its fallout.
 Mobile apps that transmit agricultural prices and weather forecasts to farmers are being used to send out messages on how to avoid contagion by COVID-19.
 In South Africa, the government is working with the private sector to manufacture 10,000 ventilators, while garment factories in Kenya and Ghana have switched to making masks and protective clothing.
 Still, plummeting revenues signal tough times ahead for African social enterprises, Mwangi warned.
 "There is a funding drought coming in 2021 and its going to be Darwinian. Social businesses can't just say 'I'm saving one village'. They must have a way to scale-up, to set off a virtuous cycle," he said.
 But the days of maximising profit at any cost appear numbered, he said:
 "The big, bad consequences of the future are no longer decades away. They're not our children's problems, they have become ours."

“I couldn’t be more excited about this year and coming back,” Garza said. “Going through the process, I learned a lot, but at the end of the day, going through this team’s potential, I felt like this was something I couldn’t turn down and not be a part of.”
 Garza was joined on the team by Baylor senior Jared Butler, Oklahoma State freshman Cade Cunningham and Illinois junior Ayo Dosunmu. Seniors Corey Kispert of Gonzaga and Arizona State’s Remy Martin tied for the final spot.
 Garza was one of college basketball’s dominant players as a junior, averaging 23.9 points and 9.8 rebounds per game while shooting 54% from the floor. The 6-foot-11 forward was a first-team AP All-American and finished second to Dayton’s Obi Toppin in national player of the year voting.
 Iowa was ranked a program-high No. 5 in the AP preseason Top 25, in large part due to Garza’s decision to return.
 “He might average a point or two less, but all that kid cares about is winning,” Iowa coach Fran McCaffrey said. “He’s put the time in. He’s not rested on his accomplishments. He’s hungrier than he’s ever been. There’s no better example for these young guys than Luka Garza.”
 Same could be said for Butler.
 A 6-3 guard, he had a strong freshman season in 2018-19 and was even better as a sophomore, averaging 16.0 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game to earn third-team AP All-America honours.
 Baylor looked like a potential Final Four team a year ago before the pandemic cancelled the season, and it could be in the mix again now that Butler is back after withdrawing from the NBA draft. The Bears were No. 2 in the AP preseason poll, highest in school history.
 “Jared has shown tremendous growth in his first two seasons at Baylor, both on and off the court,” Baylor coach Scott Drew said. “He has always been a great teammate with an infectious personality and now that he’s an upperclassman, he’s taken on more of a leadership role.”
 The dynamic Dosunmu also took a look at the NBA before deciding to return, a huge boost for the No. 8 Illini.

In the first season after the crash, Marshall won just two games. The first winning season didn’t come for another 13 years. Then success occurred in streaks.
 Marshall captured Division I-AA national championships in 1992 and 1996 and amassed the most wins of any team in the nation in the 1990s, many of them during a step up into Division I-A under coach Bob Pruett. An athlete named Randy Moss started a journey there that would redefine what was possible in terms of speed, power and size at the wide receiver position.
 The success continues now in the Bowl Subdivision under coach Doc Holliday, who is 6-1 in bowl games and won a Conference USA championship in 2014.
 The plane crash redefined comebacks and helped shape the identity of the public university that serves 13,000 students in Huntington.
 “It’s who we are,” said athletic director Mike Hamrick, who played linebacker from 1976 to 1979. “There’s not been a comeback story like Marshall football.”
 Marshall's chartered DC-9 was returning from a game at East Carolina on Nov. 14, 1970, when it slammed into a hillside in rain and fog just short of the Huntington airport runway. The jet burst into flames, leaving a charred swath of trees. Investigators concluded that the plane was flying too low, either because of faulty altitude equipment or the pilots’ failure to read their instruments properly.
 Everyone on board perished: 36 football players, 39 coaches, school administrators, community leaders, boosters and the flight crew.

Mohinder Singh is expected to plead to four counts of culpable driving causing death and six other charges in relation to the crash on the Eastern Freeway at Kew on April 22 this year, Melbourne Magistrates Court heard on Thursday. Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor, Senior Constable Kevin King and constables Glen Humphris and Josh Prestney were killed after they pulled over Porsche driver Richard Pusey because he was allegedly speeding. Singh, 48, indicated he wanted to plead to a total of ten charges after 27 were dropped in the court. His lawyer Peter Morrissey SC told the court it was “very desirable” for the truckie to plead for his sake and the families of the deceased. But in a rare move the matter will be uplifted to the Supreme Court of Victoria because of how serious the crime is and the amount of public interest in the case. The truckie was allegedly drug-affected and fatigued when he crashed into the police officers. Charges remaining against Mr Singh include deal with the proceeds of crime, possess drug of dependence and trafficking drugs of dependence including cannabis, meth and 1-4 butanediol. He is also still facing a charge of possessing cartridge ammunition without a license. Mr Pusey, a mortgage broker, has also been charged in relation to the crash. The 42-year-old Porsche driver spent almost six months behind bars on a string of charges including reckless conduct endangering life and outraging public decency. He was granted bail in October. The businessman has been banned from driving, has to adhere to a curfew, undergo psychiatric treatment, surrender his passport and cannot contact witnesses. He has also been barred from using electronic communications and social media to publish anything about or to discuss the circumstances in the lead-up to the alleged offending with certain exceptions. Mr Singh, the truck driver, will return to the Melbourne Magistrates Court on December 3 before the matter is heard in the higher court.
