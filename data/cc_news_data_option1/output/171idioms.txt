The Spy Guy's usually reliable sources claim the automaker will not cancel the 370Z as he originally believed. Instead, Nissan is developing a new -- or significantly revamped -- replacement, possibly labeled the 400Z. Plans call for an updated platform and suspension to keep the two-seater competitive with the 2020 Toyota Supra. There are also hints that more than a single powertrain could be in the works, including a twin-turbocharged 3.0-litre V-6 that's found in the Infiniti division's Q50 sedan and Q60 coupe. That engine makes 400 horsepower and 395 pound-feet of torque while the current Z's 3.7-litre non-turbo V-6 makes 322 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque, or 350/276 in NISMO trim. A hybrid option is also anticipated. Assuming everything works out, the New Z could appear in 2021 as a 2022 model.

The preparedness to implement the State-level ban on single-use plastic goods was the major issue at the Kozhikode Corporation Council meeting on Tuesday.
 IUML councillor C. Abdurahman pointed out that merchants had stocked a lot of single-use plastic products and hence they should be given a breathing period until the existing stock was cleared.
 However, Mayor Thottathil Raveendran refused to give the merchants more chances after the expiry of the breathing period provided by the Kerala High Court up to January 20.
 Independent councillor Mohammed Shameel said a lot of products claiming to be biodegradable plastic had found their way to the market and the Corporation should check if they were, in fact, biodegradable.
 Corporation Secretary Binu Francis said those products with a QR code that could be scanned, a certificate from the Central or State Pollution Control Board or those with an ISO 17088 certification were to be considered biodegradable and hence excluded from confiscation. He said the Corporation machinery would be in full swing from Wednesday onwards to implement the plastic ban.
 Besides the local bodies, the district administration and the Pollution Control Board are implementing the ban. Any violations were punishable by the imposition of a fine of ₹10,000 for the first time, ₹25,000 for the second time and ₹50,000 for the third time, said the Secretary.
 ## S.M. Street work
 The council’s decision to carry out several activities at S.M. Street with private participation drew flak from the Opposition councillors. IUML councillor Kunhamutti suggested that the activities be carried out directly by the Corporation, without private involvement. He criticised the poor state of lighting on the street barely a year after it was set up.
 The Council has decided to ensure that the existing lights were functional, to provide new lights, set up a music system, carry out beautification wherever needed, construct toilets wherever necessary, make drinking water available for customers at the street and employ security personnel. The ideas will be finalised after consulting representatives of the merchant bodies.
 The Council has also sanctioned ₹1.5 lakh to conduct soil investigation at the land at Kothi, where a modern slaughterhouse has been planned.

She had a career with Frederick Health as a Programs Manager for 20 years and will be deeply missed by her colleagues. In addition to her husband, daughter, and mother, Tracey is survived by four siblings, Dianne Wells and her husband, Tim, Roger Black and his wife, Teresa, Graeme Black and his wife, Heide, and Zoe Worrell and her husband, Tim, as well as numerous nieces and nephews, two great-nephews, a loving in-law family, a large family of aunts, uncles, and cousins living in Ireland, and many dear friends.

Former India cricketers VVS Laxman, Sanjay Manjrekar and Harbhajan Singh on Tuesday gave a thumbs down to Virat Kohli's decision to bat at number four in the first ODI against Australia here.
 Kohli, whose usual batting position is number three, pushed himself down the order to accommodate specialist openers Shikhar Dhawan and K L Rahul.
 Dhawan opened alongside Rohit Sharma while Rahul batted at three, disturbing the combination that India employed successfully after the World Cup in July, leading to a crushing 10-wicket loss at the hands of Australia.
 "I don't see this plan working (Kohli at No 4). Even Sachin Tendulkar never liked batting at No 4 (reference to the 2007 World Cup). The last team you would like to experiment against is Australia," Laxman told Star Sports.
 "Now again it is too late to change the combination. But may be Virat can come at No 3 and Rahul at No 4. Shikhar got some runs and so will have his confidence high," he said referring to Dhawan's 74.
 Spin great Harbhajan, who was also commentating on the game, said Kohli is the team's best batsman and he should stick to his usual batting position.
 "He has won so many games for India at number three. There is no need to change that," said Harbhajan.
 Manjrekar added: "It is not a great move as it pushes Shreyas Iyer down to five after you gave him time to settle at number four (in the earlier series). If India continue with this, it might be pushed to the same situation that it was in the past."
 Kohli came out to bat in the 28th and lasted only 14 balls.
 "I would love it if I see Kohli comes to bat in 28th over," former Australia opener Matthew Hayden said.

From social networks to neurosciences, graphs have rapidly become ubiquitous by offering a versatile modeling framework in which data points are represented as nodes, and various aspects of the underlying organization of the data are captured through edges. Brain Connectomics ––– a developing field in cognitive neuroscience ––– is a case in point, as it strives to understand cognitive processes and psychiatric diseases through the analysis of interactions between brain regions. However, in the high-dimensional, low- sample, and noisy regimes that typically characterize fMRI data, the recovery of such interactions remains an ongoing challenge: how can we discover robust patterns of co-activity between brain regions that could then be associated to cognitive processes or psychiatric disorders? How can we quantify the uncertainty associated to these discoveries? In this talk, we investigate a constrained Bayesian Independent Component Analysis (ICA) approach which simultaneously allows (a) the flexible integration of multiple sources of information (fMRI, DWI, anatomical, etc.), (b) an automatic and parameter-free selection of the appropriate sparsity level and number of connected submodules and (c) the provision of estimates on the uncertainty of the recovered interactions. Our experiments, both on synthetic and real-life data, validate the flexibility of our method and highlight the benefits of integrating anatomical information for connectome inference.

Children love with no questions asked. Not only the strangers at the grocery store they say hi to for the tenth time you roll by them with your shopping cart, but also their very holy selves. I will never forget when my daughter started crawling at about 7 months old. She crawled over to a full-length mirror on the wall and started kissing her reflection. I started giggling. “That’s you. You’re the baby. Awww you love the baby.” As my daughter was having a mini makeout-fest with her reflection, I instantly thought, _wow if the world could only look at their reflections with that much love every day, we might float away._ Children love. Plain and simple. Any being who shows up in their world is pure magic, until they give them a reason to feel otherwise. But even moments of hate are short-lived with children (see #4). As an adult, this has taught me forgiveness. In my impassioned moments, I remember the sweetness of my 7-month old loving on her reflection. Hate is so not worth it in the end.

With 90 new government medical colleges opening in the past five years, the number of government-run medical colleges have surpassed private medical colleges for the first time in India, according to government data.In the academic year 2019-20, 279 government medical colleges offered MBBS courses, against 260 private ones.In the academic year 2014-15, there were 215 private medical colleges and 189 government medical colleges, showed the five year comparative data (2014-2019) from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.There has been a 47% rise in government medical colleges during 2014-19, compared to a 33% increase in the total number of medical colleges in the past five years, from 404 in 2014-15 to 539 in 2019."The improvement is a result of the current government's focus on strengthening the medical education system in the country, for which several concrete measures have been taken in the past few years such as converting certain district hospitals into medical colleges. Many states have also chipped in and opened medical colleges, which also helped," said Dr VK Paul, chairman, board of governors, Medical Council of India.It costs ₹300-400 crore to establish a medical college; the recurring cost annually is around ₹50 crore. "Another reason could be that it is mandatory to run a hospital attached to a medical college for training purposes, which can be very cost intensive. Many private players fizzle out after a point as they aren't able to meet the recurring cost," according to Paul.The number of undergraduate medical seats has also seen a jump of 48%, from 54,348 in 2014-15 to 80,312 in the academic year 2019-20. Post graduate seats have also increased by 18,704 (a 65% jump) during the corresponding period."We are aiming to bring the MBBS seats up to around 1.2 lakh since according to estimates that figure should put us at a comfortable place in terms of numbers. Once that is achieved then the focus will be on other areas that are deficient," said Arun Singhal, special secretary, health ministry.The Medical Council of India has also amended regulations to increase the number of teachers in medical colleges. "Faculty numbers will also improve gradually as we have made changes, including allowing DNBs to teach. There is also a large pool of doctors in defence services (at any given time 250-300 doctors) as they retire early but are eligible to teach up to 70 years. All these measures will bring change that's necessary over time," Paul said.According to experts, the challenge will be to find good faculty for new colleges."In the long run it will help but for the time being it's going to be an uphill task to maintain quality of these new colleges as finding good teachers isn't easy. There's immense shortage of quality faculty, especially for medical colleges in remote areas. Ideally, the government should think rationally, and instead of opening new colleges consolidate what they have," according to Dr MC Misra, former director, AIIMS, Delhi.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, is being seen in the perspective of the National Population Register-National Register of Citizens, and there is not much to find fault with this perception. The fact is that the common man is truly apprehensive. This policy-troika now under way appears to delineate differences where none should exist. And this is precisely what has fuelled the peoples’ agitation. The government is yet to proceed beyond parsing a conciliatory sentence, much less open a dialogue. The deterioration in the economy and employment is only adding to the angst.
 R. Narayanan,

 The protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, are now drifting without a credible face to anchor them and are becoming more sporadic in nature. One also has the government in its wisdom reluctant to talk to anyone to clear misgivings in the minds of people and also getting away in the process on account of its sheer and brute majority in Parliament. It seems to have forgotten that in a democracy, debate and discussion are essential. It is saddening that there is no meeting ground between the protesters and the government to sort out the issues and saving the country from the continuing chaos and disruptions. There has to be a focus on steps to ensure progress and prosperity.

 The writer, in her eagerness to romanticise the anti-CAA protests as a massive popular uprising against the government, has glossed over the unfolding silent backlash against the perceived excesses of the protests (Editorial page, “Sparkling people, a spiritless Opposition”, January 14). That the pro-CAA support has been muted does not mean the silent majority has endorsed the streak of intolerance that permeated the street protests in the initial phase. The Opposition has developed cold feet after going overboard in fanning the flames of discord because the milking of political capital is an exercise fraught with electoral risks. There is no denying the fact that the anti-CAA protests have gained a sectarian streak. The neutral observers who have been following the anti-CAA bandwagon see the waving of the national flag not as a spontaneous outburst of the pluralist sentiment; they consider it as a belated attempt to blunt the growing perception that opposition to a law is a mere front for spewing hatred against an elected government. The attempt to depict the protests as the fight between a community and the government was a dangerous narrative that upset those who seem willing to accept the articulation of the CAA as positive discrimination in favour of persecuted people who have cultural links with the nation.

LODI, Calif. (KTXL/CNN) - A school bus in California came dangerously close to a freight train at a railroad crossing.Justin Clubb captured the video Monday of the bus as it was inches away from the train. The video shows the crossing arm on top of the bus as the speeding train goes by.“When the arm started coming down, they pulled forward a little bit and I was like, ‘Oh no, they’re in trouble,’" Clubb said.The Lodi Unified School District bus had one student on board with the driver. The school district released a statement that it is investigating the incident, and no one was harmed.Some who live in Lodi said this video raises concerns about students’ safety on school buses.“It’s really disturbing, and I’m just thankful that the child was OK," Cindy Luna said.Clubb said he hopes the video serves as a lesson to other bus drivers to not end up in a similar situation.“Let’s hope it prevents another thing, so all kids can go home safe," Clubb said.Copyright 2020 KTXL via CNN.

Si tratta proprio del periodo in cui il Napoli passò nelle mani di Aurelio De Laurentiis. _ "Con la mia famiglia siamo stati davvero vicino al Napoli. Non me ne sono mai occupato personalmente, ma papà diceva sempre che era tutto per fatto. __Cosa accadde? De Laurentiis fece un 'offerta a papà, ma lui non accettò. Così mio padre fu fatto fuori e De Laurentiis si è preso il Napoli. Per me è stato un peccato perché avremmo potuto unire le forze. A chi non piacerebbe oggi far parte del Napoli? Peraltro con le conoscenze che ho maturato in questi anni sarei pronto a tornare di corsa in un club italiano"._

Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Abid, you clearly highlighted that there is an improved funnel that's driving confidence of growth, sort of improving going forward. And also the fact that there is a potential deceleration of headwinds from the existing client buckets and at some point, they would actually start spending. So I just wanted your thoughts on two things. One is, in terms of the funnel, are these more cost takeout kind of spends, or are these higher on the digital side of spends? And second, something that's at loggerheads with the broader thought process, if you could clarify that. The broader market environment appears to be -- continues to be weak, at least if you look at banks and their own profitability and so on so forth. So what in your mind is sort of changing that they will actually come back and really spend? And what is the confidence of that really happening?

But even during those times when I seem to have “it all” can feel empty. I once had a GPA of 3.98 for a semester, taking organic chemistry and biology (an A- in biology lab did me in), and didn’t feel any better for it. It was something I worked incredibly hard to achieve, but once I was there — I realized how isolating being there was when I was neglecting other parts of my life that I will remember at the end of the day.

 “The first two seasons we had this giant mystery about Jack hanging over, and so by its very nature, the show’s gotten quieter,” Fogelman says. “I think by the time we’re in our sixth season, you’ll have a lot of the information about what’s happened to this family and what will be left is some resolution.

Also attending the meeting was US Ambassador to Bucharest Adrian Zuckerman.      According to the MAE, Minister Aurescu underscored that Romania and the United States have a very strong strategic partnership, with an "important" development potential, and remarked the role of cooperation with the US partners, such as the Lockheed Martin company, in strengthening this partnership on its defence, economic and research dimensions.      Moreover, he highlighted how important is for Romania to ensure national and regional security and to observe its commitments made under the North-Atlantic Alliance.      In this context, the Minister of Foreign Affairs specified that Romania maintains its commitment to earmark 2 per cent of its budget to defence and to continue efforts to strengthen national defence capabilities, shows the MAE release.      The head of the diplomacy maintained the main objectives of Romania in the defence field, the cooperation with the US being especially important, both in terms of endowment with the equipment needed in the specific security context in the Black Sea region and when it comes to ensuring a substantial military presence of the US partner in Romania.      They also reviewed on the same occasion the tradition and diversity of cooperation between Romania and Lockheed Martin, and also the opportunities in strengthening collaboration, both in the defence industry and through projects related to maintenance and modernisation of certain equipment in the aviation field, and in research.      The Romanian Minister underscored the interest in developing research projects in Romania, through the involvement of researchers in our country, with an emphasis on the new technologies. Moreover, Aurescu also evoked the possibility of some projects part of the cultural dimension of the Strategic Partnership that might support Lockheed Martin in Romania.      In her turn, Marillyn Hewson showed interest in continuing Lockheed Martin Corporation's involvement in our country and, "while underscoring the existence in Romania of skilled and talented workforce and a solid industrial foundation," and she supported the objective of developing common projects in the defence and research field, with an emphasis on the new technologies, such as artificial intelligence.      According to the MAE, Lockheed Martin is the largest company of military products and services worldwide in terms of revenue. In 2018, the corporation's sales reached 53.8 billion US dollars, and the company ranked 59th on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of largest industrial corporations. Lockheed Martin is present in 75 countries worldwide, including Romania (since 1997) and has approximately 105,000 employees.

"Olive, Again" by Elizabeth Strout. Random House, 2019. 304 pages.      Few people, fictional or otherwise, make me cringe like Olive Kitteridge does. When I read any of the linked stories in "Olive, Again," a new collection of fiction by Elizabeth Strout, I stop thinking of Olive as a character in a book. She is real to me, her blunt candor a force I do not at first find charming or endearing, as many do, but that is, eventually, irresistible and cause for deep thought.      Rooted in New England sensibilities, Olive has traits we know. She would be one to speak her mind at town meeting or say what she thinks at the coffee shop regardless of who overhears. That's the power of Olive Kitteridge. She says what she thinks. If there's anything amusing about her, it's the magnetism with which she draws people to her in spite of her rough edges. Says her second husband Jack Kennison as he considers her attraction, "She had an honesty - was it an honesty? - she had something about her." He liked the "Olive-ness" of her and thought, "Olive Kitteridge. Tall, big; God she was a strange woman."      Elizabeth Strout's first book about Olive, "Olive Kitteridge," was published in 2008. The work was honored with a Pulitzer Prize and was made into a popular HBO mini-series that was filmed on Massachusetts' North Shore and Cape Ann in 2013. "Olive, Again," this recent collection of linked short stories set in Crosby, Maine, takes up the small matters of everyday life from multiple points of view. Some of the short stories merely reference Olive while others are told from her point of view. She is the hub throughout, structurally and spiritually - disdained, appreciated, loveable by some, life- changing.      "Olive, Again," is nonetheless Olive, exiting. The book tracks Olive as she ages and moves through relationships, health issues and residences. Strout is remarkable for the way she brings readers the story of aging in all its big and small parts, expressed by its characters in moments of loneliness, terror and occasions of happiness. The insights range from small and obvious to profound and surprising. Foremost are issues of identity, regret, wisdom and day-to-day life as it is lived in the later years.      Strout wins over her readers' admiration, also, in how she evokes everyday life. Her writing provides opportunities for identification with characters and events. Details of the daily interactions characters experience and respond to are spot on. We recognize the precision of the storytelling and we note how there is no pause button. Bad things happen. Bad things pass.      For example, after a good day spent on an excursion in Maine, where they lived, Jack and Olive unexpectedly run into Elaine, Jack's former lover while married to his first wife. Elaine was the cause of his premature retirement from teaching at Harvard after she went to the administration with charges of sexual harassment. After seeing her in the public setting of a restaurant so many years later, Jack realizes Elaine had been a careerist who had engineered the affair, the $300,000 payout and advancement in her teaching profession. Driving home with Olive, all these realizations begin to sink in.      "… as he drove along the river without seeing anything except the white line in the road, it returned to him, the fact that Olive was his wife, and that they had had a day together of happiness before seeing Elaine tonight. But it did not feel like happiness that he had experienced with Olive, it felt far away from him now. And so the day they had had together folded over on itself, was done with, gone. In the silence of the dark car Jack was aware of Olive - his wife - aware of her presence in a way that felt insurmountable."      Despite how crushing the truth of Elaine's devious behavior was, despite how much he missed his first wife, Jack understood well that "… he knew, even tonight in his grief, that his marriage to Olive had been surprisingly wonderful in many ways, to go into old age with this woman who was so - so Olive."      When reading "Olive, Again," we appreciate what Strout's characters have to show us about life, aging and acceptance. The experience is both unsettling and entertaining. As for our embrace of Olive, we do more than condone her candor, we celebrate it and maybe even advocate for more of it in the dailiness of our own lives.

Sabato 11 gennaio, nella tredicesima gara del campionato di Calcio a 5 serie C2 gir. A, la compagine barese ha vinto 5-1 contro il Nox Molfetta, chiudendo il girone di andata al secondo posto a quota 30 punti, con 9 vittorie, 3 pareggi e 1 sconfitta.
 “ _La partita è andata come da previsione_ – ha affermato il coach Colaianni –. _Al ritorno dalla pausa natalizia, i ragazzi mentalmente hanno bisogno di un po’ più di tempo per tuffarsi nella realtà del campionato. Tutto sommato le difficoltà sono state quelle che ho messo in preventivo_ ”.
 Nel match contro i molfettesi, giocato nel palazzetto coperto del Cus, il primo tempo è iniziato bene per i padroni di casa che sono andati in vantaggio grazie alla rete di Gramegna, al suo primo goal stagionale. Il primo tempo si è chiuso con i padroni di casa in vantaggio. Al rientro in campo i cussini hanno abbassato i ritmi di gioco, concedendo campo al Molfetta, che ne ha approfittato. Al 43’, a seguito di una distrazione della difesa barese, è arrivato il goal del pareggio. Però questo ha svegliato i giocatori di coach Colaianni che hanno ripreso in mano il gioco e sono tornati in vantaggio e hanno allungato le distanze. Subito dopo cinque minuti Sardella ha servito perfettamente Bardaro che ha siglato il 2-1 e successivamente si è messo in evidenza come uno dei migliori giocatori in campo, firmando anche la terza rete cussina. Al termine del tempo regolamentare di gioco, trascinati dall’euforia del sorpasso, i biancorossi non si sono fermati e nel recupero è arrivato prima il goal di Giuseppe Mercadante e poi la doppietta di Gramegna, che ha chiuso il match sul 5-1 per il Cus Bari.
 “ _Nella prima parte di gara potevamo realizzare più goal, ma mi aspettavo un primo tempo di difficoltà. Al ritorno in campo abbiamo avuto delle difficoltà e loro ne hanno approfittato, pareggiando. Poi, per fortuna, visto che abbiamo lavorato bene durante la sosta, fisicamente siamo emersi e abbiamo dilagato_ ”.
 La squadra ha fronteggiato a testa alta il girone di andata, concedendo poco e addirittura vincendo in casa contro la prima in classifica. Nel proprio palazzetto i cussini hanno vinto tutte le gare, 7/7. Fuori casa, invece, hanno concesso qualche punto. Ma nel complesso una prima parte di stagione più che positiva. Manca la ciliegina sulla torta, che si spera arrivi con il girone di ritorno.
 “ _È andata molto bene. Siamo ad un punto dalla prima e lotteremo fino alla fine per salire direttamente di categoria. Qualche rammarico per i punti persi fuori casa, per alcune insufficienze, però calcolando il potenziale economico dalla prima in classifica, notevole rispetto al nostro, è stata una prima parte di stagione positiva_ ”.

So it was little surprise that not only was the organized Jewish community, which rightly regards the struggle for civil rights for African-Americans as linked to the battle against antisemitism, was slow to react to the attacks in New York. But now that the leading groups are trying to take this problem seriously, their resolve is being undermined by a sense within much of the Jewish community that speaking too loudly about antisemitism among blacks is tantamount to racism. The same arguments are being thrown about criticizing the efforts of those who are trying to change a new “bail reform” law that has resulted in the release of some of those guilty of attacking Jews.

The Sleuth's sources report that, at long last, the first of three new tall- wagon models will start arriving in early 2020. The five-passenger GV80 is set to compete with The BMX X3, Audi Q5 and Mercedes-Benz GLC, among others. It will also appear similar to the GV80 concept vehicle. The intelligence gathered on the upcoming Genesis indicates that it will be built off the G80 rear-wheel-drive sedan platform, although all-wheel-drive will most certainly be available, if not standard equipment. As for powertrains, a twin- turbocharged 3.3-litre V-6 with 365 horsepower will most likely get the nod, but a hybrid system will likely be optional.

So both the retail companies and CPG company to my point, but in my mind, will continue to invest significantly on technology. And if you look at the growth of some of the CPG companies that we have seen, they are actually growing in emerging markets and they continue to invest in that, which is their next way of growth. And our presence outside of the US is also helping us to go after that part of the business. So net-net, the industry will continue to be volatile and choppy. We'll stay focused on where the customers are investing, especially on the technology transformation. I think that's the right way to go in my point of view, Sudheer.

All 269 passengers were killed, CNN wrote, on the flight that had originated at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport en route to Seoul's Gimpo International Airport via Anchorage. Soviet officials claimed they believed the aircraft to be an American spy plane, The Week reported, that looked similar to the Korean Air aircraft.  
 It was the second time that a Korean Air aircraft was fired upon by Soviet forces, the first time being in 1978, the New York Times reported, on a flight from Paris to Seoul via Anchorage and Tokyo that also strayed into USSR airspace. The pilot, who cited an error in the aircraft's navigational system for the accidental incursion, was able to land deep within the communist country, saving the lives of almost everyone on board.

Larry Fink's annual finger-wagging letter to chief executives has become a feature of the corporate governance calendar, often setting the agenda for global companies and shareholders alike.
 In recent years the head of BlackRock has railed against short-termism and political dysfunction, argued for US companies to repatriate overseas cash, and warned businesses they must contribute more to society.
 His latest missive, sent on Tuesday morning, centred on climate change and its impact on investment risk. "Awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance," the chief executive of the world's biggest fund manager wrote.
 It was released alongside an open letter to BlackRock's clients which set out a series of changes geared at putting sustainability at the centre of its investment approach. These include increasing the number of sustainable funds it offers, removing some coal companies from its active funds and being more transparent over its engagement and voting at investee companies.
 BlackRock will also ask the companies it invests in to disclose information in line with guidelines from two influential bodies, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.
 How closely the $7tn company sticks to these goals -- and whether its rivals follow suit -- will be closely watched.
 "This is pretty bold," said a BlackRock shareholder. "The key will be that it is acted on within a clear and near timeframe."
 ## Why is BlackRock doing this?
 BlackRock has been talking about the risks of global warming for years and issued a landmark paper in 2016, where it warned that investors could no longer ignore climate change. Yet critics argue that the world's largest asset manager has failed to live up to its own rhetoric.
 A report by Majority Action, a non-profit, found that last year BlackRock supported just 12 per cent of climate change resolutions, which typically call on companies to disclose the risks they face from global warming or outline their plan for transitioning to a low-carbon world. The company's stewardship team discussed environmental issues with 316 companies in 2019, representing just 15 per cent of the businesses it met with.
 Environmental activists have argued that if BlackRock took global warming seriously there would be "rapid changes on climate change" at a corporate level. Extinction Rebellion held a protest outside its London offices last October, while groups such as BlackRock's Big Problem have sprung up, accusing the asset manager of contributing more to climate change than almost any company on earth.
 At the same time, BlackRock has faced growing calls from shareholders, clients and influential figures such as Al Gore and activist investor Chris Hohn to step up on climate change.
 Pension fund clients in particular have piled on the pressure. The $1.5tn Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan withdrew billions of dollars from BlackRock last year as the world's biggest pension fund put environmental, social and governance concerns at the centre of its investment ethos.
 Other shareholders have also become more vocal, with a coalition filing a climate change resolution with the asset manager ahead of this year's annual meeting.
 BlackRock's announcement is an attempt to ward off some of this criticism and reposition itself as a responsible investor. As former senior executive at the company says: "This is a determined effort to regain lost ground."
 "There has been a lot of internal debate and a feeling of missing the bus on climate change," they added. "You have to conclude that the decisive factors were business and reputational risk."
