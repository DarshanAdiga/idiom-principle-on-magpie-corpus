Despite Fast and Furious 9 not releasing until next year, it's been confirmed that the series will end after two more installments. As Variety reports, Justin Lin, who directed Fast and Furious 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9, will direct the last two movies in the franchise. Fast and Furious star Vin Diesel suggested in an interview with GamesRadar sister publication Total Film that Fast and Furious 10 would be split into parts, which we now know will conclude the series. That said, Diesel also said…

 Investigators searched through charred bomb fragments and scorched electronics to identify individual parts of the explosive devices. That led them to big box hardware stores and hundreds of hours of surveillance footage.
 "A lot of things can happen from a tidbit of information that I come up with. So, I always feel that responsibility, that burden of doing my job right." says analyst Jordana Nesvog, who visited crime scenes as part of the FBI's Evidence Response Team.

 He said former owner Augie Fernandes, cousin to Joe Fernandes of the former Fernandes Supermarket chain, is still with the business and will be for at least a couple of weeks if not longer.
 “He will have that option,” Ryan said.

Finding a way to get things done through the years are Lawrence and Ellen Becker.  Both attorneys in independent practice, they're longtime residents of the neighborhood and fixtures on the small board of directors.  Saving the old St. Anthony's and starting an arts center was the brainchild of their daughter Gabrielle, then in her early 20s.  She led the purchase of the building from the diocese for $5,000 and then moved out of Albany a couple of years later. There was talk in those early years of pursuing a full renovation and restoration to the tune of more than $1 million.  Now that's probably just a dream.  The current institutional budget sits at around $20,000.

“He dials in on the little fundamentals that I need with double teams and stuff like that,” Cleveland said. “It’s easy footwork-wise because everything kind of transfers from position to position. It’s just nice to be able to have all those things and have him help me build on them.”
 The biggest difference for Cleveland so far has been the timing of everything. While there’s a little more margin for error playing inside and not having to go head-to-head with someone on the outside, the play itself tends to develop a lot quicker on the inside.
 That’s something Cleveland continues to take in stride. His main focus is on improving throughout his rookie season, even if he isn’t quite sure what position he’s going to play down the road.
 “It’s been a fun experience,” he said. “Just getting those reps at different positions, it’s new, it’s exciting, and it’s nice to have those tools in the tool belt. They are just things I can use in the future. Honestly, wherever the team needs me, I’ll play and try to do my best.”

While most drivers ignored her, seven were forthcoming with their experiences. One particularly vivid account was the story of a woman who got into a cab months after the tsunami, and asked to go to the Miyagi district, which had been completely destroyed. After informing her of Miyagi's destruction, the cab driver admitted that the strange passenger then asked him, "Have I died?"
 The _Unsolved Mystery_ __episode details a similar account. "A man around 20 years old wearing a thick coat got into a taxi," Kudo's professor, Kanebishi, said. "The driver felt there was something strange about the passenger. By the time they arrived, the sun had already set. When he looked back, the passenger was gone."
 Professor Kanebishi noted that there were physical records from the trip to follow, which corroborated the drivers' stories. In the episode, he theorized that the increased sightings were the result of PTSD.
 ## After the tsunami, some thought they were possessed by ghosts.

 The annual medical reimbursement insurance policy, which began Oct. 1, will cover illnesses, injuries — including those sustained in the line of duty — diagnostic testing and therapies. The plan allows the freedom to use any licensed veterinarian, specialty center or emergency hospital in the United States.
 The policy will be administered by Trupanion, a leader in medical insurance for cats and dogs that offers injury and illnesses coverage for working and service dogs both on and off duty.

BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA. — El expresidente boliviano Evo Morales anuncio sus planes de regresar a Bolivia pero advirtio que no tiene pensado asumir un puesto en el proximo gobierno que, segun los resultados electorales preliminares, recaeria en su delfin Luis Arce.En una conferencia de prensa brindada en Buenos Aires al dia siguiente de las elecciones en las que Arce se habria impuesto con la mayoria de los votos, Morales tambien dijo que si Estados Unidos quiere retomar las relaciones diplomaticas con su pais lo haga con respeto.Tarde o mas temprano vamos a volver a Bolivia. Eso no esta en debate... es cuestion de tiempo, señalo el exmandatario, refugiado en Buenos Aires desde noviembre de 2019 luego de renunciar a la presidencia en medio de la convulsion que se produjo tras las elecciones generales en las que buscaba su cuarto mandato consecutivo y que fueron anuladas por denuncias de fraude.Al ser consultado sobre cual seria su rol luego de volver, Morales señalo que yo estoy en la zona del tropico, de Cochabamba, voy a volver a ser agricultor o pequeño productor.Sin embargo, indico que esta en contacto con Arce y apunto que con Lucho presidente y David (Choquehuanca) vicepresidente vamos a sacar adelante a Bolivia, vamos a enfrentar la crisis economica, la crisis sanitaria. Morales califico a Arce como uno de los mejores economistas de America Latina y un hombre con mucha cualidad humana, muy solidario, muy honesto.En Bolivia, el candidato de centro y expresidente Carlos Mesa reconocio el lunes su derrota aunque aun no se conocen los resultados oficiales.Con poco mas del 31% de las actas de votacion escrutadas Arce parecia consolidar su victoria.Al referirse a Estados Unidos, el que fuera el primer presidente indigena de Bolivia señalo que la politica del Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) -el partido que el lidera- consiste en tener relaciones con todo el mundo, incluido el pais norteamericano, pero aclaro que deben ser de respeto mutuo.Recordo que en 2008, por una cuestion de dignidad del pueblo boliviano, tomo la decision de expulsar al entonces embajador estadounidense y afirmo que si ese pais quiere retomar las relaciones bienvenido, pero que nos respete, que respete la dignidad y la soberania del pueblo boliviano.Por su parte, el estadounidense Michael Kozak, subsecretario de Estado adjunto del Departamento de Estado para Asuntos del Hemisferio Occidental, describio el lunes las elecciones bolivianas como pacificas y creibles.Kozak felicito a Arce durante una llamada con periodistas.El Presidente Trump y los Estados Unidos tienen ganas de trabajar con el nuevo gobierno boliviano electo en intereses comunes para nuestros ciudadanos. Estados Unidos ha demostrado que puede ser un aliado de exito de una gran gama de gobiernos, dijo Kozak.Cuando se le menciono la conexion entre Arce y Morales y se le pregunto si Estados Unidos consideraba la victoria como algo negativo, Kozak respondio que su pais no iba a hacer presunciones sobre cuales seran sus politicas, dijo en referencia a Arce.Trabajaremos con su gobierno y si este esta dispuesto a trabajar con nosotros en areas de interes y valores comunes, tenemos ganas de ponernos manos a la obra, dijo.En otro momento, Morales invito a todos partidos politicos, empresarios y obreros de Bolivia a un gran encuentro de reconciliacion para la reconstruccion del pais. No somos vengativos, no somos revanchistas, agrego.Morales tambien agradecio el apoyo del presidente argentino Alberto Fernandez y de la vicepresidenta y exmandataria Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (2007-2015), asi como otros dirigentes latinoamericanos y destaco la llamada de felicitacion que dijo haber recibido del papa Francisco.Fernandez y la vicepresidenta festejaron el resultado electoral.No solo es una buena noticia para quienes defendemos la democracia en America Latina; es, ademas, un acto de justicia ante la agresion que sufrio el pueblo boliviano, dijo Fernandez en su cuenta de Twitter.Fernandez de Kirchner señalo que Arce y Choquehuanca, junto a Morales, construyeron en Bolivia un gran triunfo popular. La Patria Grande feliz, agrego.

Behind the scenes, three of North Carolina's new voting rules were still in limbo as two federal lawsuits and a state lawsuit were being decided.
 On Oct. 3, Wake County Superior Court Judge Bryan Collins accepted a settlement agreement that changed three of North Carolina's election rules. The agreement was unanimously approved by the N.C. Board of Elections.
 The settlement extended the deadline to accept mail-in ballots; allowed affidavits for ballot envelopes lacking witness signatures; and allowed mailed-in ballots to be dropped off at election offices and at early voting sites.
 Senate Leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore accused the elections board and the attorney general's office of trying to usurp their constitutional authority by changing election rules through a "secretive" settlement agreement.
 Last week, U.S. District Court Judge William Osteen stopped the board of elections from moving forward without witness signatures. But he said not have authority to rule on the other provisions, leaving it in the hands of the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to decide.
 That happened Tuesday night.
 The federal appellate court decision puts an end to the lawsuits, if the judges' decision isn't appealed to the highest court.

By ELLIOT SPAGAT   Associated Press  
 SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Trump administration announced Tuesday that asylum- seekers will lose their bids if they are convicted of driving under the influence or committing crimes to support gangs.
 The rule, which takes effect Nov. 20, is the latest in a slew of measures to make asylum more difficult to obtain.
 The immediate impact will be muted by a temporary pandemic-related ban on asylum introduced in March that calls for people who enter the country illegally to be immediately expelled on public health grounds.
 While asylum has long been denied to people convicted of “particularly serious crimes,” the new rule adds a litany of crimes that would be disqualifying. They include convictions for domestic violence — whether a felony or misdemeanor — assault or battery, re-entering the country illegally, identify theft, public benefits fraud, immigrant smuggling and driving under the influence.
 The rules would also deny asylum to people convicted of crimes that an adjudicator “knows or has reason to believe” was committed to support a criminal street gang.
 The rule to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register and signed by Attorney General William Barr rejects much of the criticism since it was first proposed in December, including that the authority to declare crimes gang- related was too broad and prone to error. The administration deflected criticism that DUI wasn't serious enough to merit automatic denial.
 Advocacy groups criticized the move.
 “The administration is showing needless cruelty by layering these new bars on an asylum system which already has been decimated since Trump entered office," said Heidi Altman, the National Immigrant Justice Center's policy director.
 Asylum is for people fleeing persecution for their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership in a social group. It isn’t intended for people who migrate for economic reasons.
 President Donald Trump has called asylum “a scam” and has introduced a string policies against it since the U.S. became the world's top destination for asylum-seekers in 2017.
 A rule proposed in June gives judges the power to reject claims without a hearing. Several new factors weigh against asylum, including failure to pay taxes.
 A rule in July lets authorities block asylum-seekers from countries with widespread communicable disease.

On the Rocks review: "Bill Murray essays pure, distilled Murray-ness"


--DocBreak--
Rather than starting last weekend like the schedule originally planned to, the matchup was rescheduled for games on Wednesday and Thursday because of COVID-19 issues within the Tigers program. After a string of positive tests within the team, Taylor and his staff decided it was best to have the entire program quarantine.
 According to a team spokesperson, the entire team should be out of quarantine by Wednesday night’s matchup at Foster Auditorium.
 Alabama coach Lindsey Devine hopes to reverse the Tide’s recent trend against MU. Dating back to 2015, the Tigers have beat the Crimson Tide in seven straight games, including winning twice last season.
 In addition to returning five starters from last season, Devine added four freshmen and four transfers to the roster. After Alabama took the Tigers to a five-game set last season, Taylor knows how difficult the Crimson Tide offense could be.
 “At times rather than being good at volleyball, they try to trick you,” Taylor said. “The key is identifying different situations we put them in and how they will respond to those situations, while acting accordingly to be successful.”
 As Taylor puts more and more trust into his roster, the team knows the importance of keeping each other in check.
 “We’re trying to build a better culture now, placing more accountability on the players,” Deberg said.
 The Tigers are looking to evolve into an elite program, and Taylor is hoping that the playing experience and deep depth of the roster will not only lead them against Alabama, but the entire conference.
 Wednesday’s doubleheader can be viewed on SEC Network+.

 # Gila River Arena on track to serve as county voting center

 Gila River Arena is set to become a voting center starting on Oct. 28, with the home of the Coyotes opened up as a place to not only drop off ballots but cast them as well.
 The Glendale facility joins nearby State Farm Stadium and Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix as voting locations that will be open to any Maricopa County registered voter. Gila River Arena will provide in-person voting and ballot drop boxes, while State Farm Stadium's parking lot will be a drive- through ballot drop location only, opening on Oct. 24.
 Coyotes president and CEO Xavier Gutierrez said members of his staff came up with idea to use Gila River Arena, which Gutierrez embraced because it lined up with his mission of outreach to make the franchise a leader in the community.
 "We believe that it is our responsibility not so much to solve any of the issues in our community but to convene people," Gutierrez said, speaking from a youth street hockey clinic in Peoria Tuesday. "The greatest opportunity for us right now is to convene folks and so that they are able to exercise their right, and for us it's about expanding that access."
 Voters will be able to park in a designated area and enter near the box office at Gila River Arena, and be allowed to vote in person or walk in and leave a completed ballot, said Kathren Coleman, deputy recorder for communications at Maricopa County Recorder's Office & Elections Department. From Oct. 28 to Oct. 31, Gila River Arena will be open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., closed on Sunday, Nov. 1, and then open again on Nov. 2 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Election Day Nov. 3 from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 "We've already had over 20,000 people cast a ballot in person, and these locations are large enough to accommodate Maricopa County voters," Coleman said, adding that voters can go to the county voting locations website and find wait times updated every 30 minutes.
 The use of the such large venues also helps with safety, as people are allowed to spread out in bigger spaces so as to diminish the chances of contracting COVID-19.
 "We've already seen historic turnout so far. We've had over 700,000 people participate in this election so far," Coleman said. "It will continue to increase. We have almost 2.6 million registered voters in Maricopa County and many of them do choose to vote early and vote by mail, but we have this option open for voters as well."
 Some voting locations have been open since Oct. 7 in the county. Coleman said various spring training sites are also drop box locations.
 Gutierrez said the Coyotes worked with the county and city of Glendale to establish the arena as a place to vote.
 "It's wonderful, because at the end of the day, we're part of the community," Gutierrez said. "The best thing that we can do is to make voting safe."

"Jeff knows he's got to protect the ball better," Pattenaude said. "He can't be cavalier with the ball. He's a great athlete. So I said `Listen man, if the guy is covered, don't jam it in there, just take off and run. You've been making a ton of plays just being an athlete and taking off and running."'

The Times said Trump's tax records show that he has invested at least $192,000 in five small companies created specifically to pursue projects in China over the years. Those companies claimed at least $97,400 in business expenses since 2010, including some minor payments for taxes and accounting fees as recently as 2018, the Times reported.

This season, the 31-year-old point guard averaged 27.2 points, 7.9 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 1.6 steals while shooting 47.2 percent from the field, per _ESPN_. Though he has somewhat shown improved chemistry with Harden at the end of the season, most people will agree it would be best for Westbrook to be traded to a team that he can call his own. Starting a new journey on a big- market team like the Knicks will enable him to return from being one of the most explosive stars in the league and a frontrunner to win the Most Valuable Player award every year.

Against that backdrop, the Trump administration has continued to push for a change to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that could eliminate food stamps for up to 700,000 adults by stiffening work requirements. Given the state of the economy, with millions left unemployed by the first wave of a pandemic that is surging into a third wave, this effort it not just out of touch; it's downright cruel.

"Their offense, they want to play fast," Hopkins said. "It's perfect for me since I'm a shooter. I can space the floor and I played point guard at my old school, so I can be a leader on and off the court. I have the experience, so that's what's really going to help the team with my leadership and my experience. I've been to the NCAA Tournament, so I know what it takes to get there."

Filming a play written and designed for the stage and adapting it for the screen, says Alexander, was “challenging yet exciting. The staging, lighting, performance — all of these things had to be adjusted to fit the medium. It was a lot of work and a lot of fun. And we were definitely able to capture/find new moments in the show, while also capturing the essence of a ‘live theatre experience’ for our audiences.” Pivoting from stage to screen is also a necessity at a time when live events are not really feasible, a course that the company is navigating by “finding ways to engage audiences without sacrificing the quality of our work. Creativity fuels the artistic process, and 2020 is forcing artists of all disciplines to dig deep into their toolboxes.”

During this year of unprecedented suffering and loss, it has been made starkly clear that our criminal justice system needs to change. More and more people recognize that humane and restorative justice practices achieve much more positive outcomes than the current punitive system that only compounds harm. In light of a national reckoning about criminal justice, it is past time for Gov. Andrew Cuomo to grant clemency to long-serving elders in New York's prisons who do not pose any threat to community safety and who are at serious risk for contracting COVID-19.

KNOXVILLE — Dobyns-Bennett girls soccer coach Tony Weaver was a believer after seeing Bearden in person.
 The Lady Bulldogs were relentless in a 9-0 win over Weaver’s Lady Indians in Tuesday’s Region 1-AAA semifinal at Turner-Allender Field. Bearden will host Science Hill, a 1-0 winner over Knox West in the other semifinal, for the regional championship on Thursday.
 Bearden (18-1) raced to a 5-0 halftime lead with an 18-2 shot advantage. They kept on the pressure in the second half before ending the match in the 67th minute on an Andrea Adkins goal.
 “That was the fastest, most physical team we’ve ever faced,” Weaver said. “I would not put it past them to go all the way. They play so fast and then we came in a little tight and gave up two quick goals. It doesn’t matter what's on the scoreboard, I’ve got great young ladies who play with great effort.”
 Zneyah McLaughlin recorded the hat trick and added an assist and Brinley Murphy had a goal and two assists for the Lady Bulldogs. Alayna Corbitt, Janie Lewis, Sarah Altshuler, Jordan Hellman and Adkins also had goals, and Becca Roth and Anna Biechler added two assists apiece.
 The victory was the 100th for Ryan Radcliffe as Bearden's coach. He was happy with his team's performance after watching the Lady Bulldogs miss scoring opportunities in the District 2-AAA tournament.
 “We are trying to find our stride,” Radcliffe said. “I didn’t think we played great games last week. We had to go back to square one and focus more on ourselves. It was cleaner and our mentality was in a good place. We talked about the games that get us to (the state tournament in) Murfreesboro and this was one of the goals.”
 Thirteen seniors — Alivia Watts, Emma True, Kinzee Mounger, Maddie France, Emily Cai, Annabeth Parker, Taylor Rigsby, Tayla Holt, Anna Kate Breeding, Blaire Barrett, Emilee Lane, Grace Schmidt and Caitlyn Wallace — played their final match for the Lady Indians (13-5).
 “We’ve had a really good season. Our only losses were to Bearden, Science Hill and Greeneville,” Weaver said. “I’m proud of every one of them, especially the 13 seniors. We’re going to miss them terribly bad.”

"Offensively, we know last game was a very poor outing by us, to say the least," said Louisville coach Scott Satterfield. "We got whipped up front, we did not make plays in the passing game. We were not in sync at all offensively, and when that happens against a really good defense you are going to look really bad. That is what happened to us."

The foreign accounts do not show up on Trump’s public financial disclosures, where he must list personal assets, because they are held under corporate names.

To help faculty get up to speed, the center developed an asynchronous course called #LearnEverywhereXULA, which took participants about 12 hours to complete. After working through eight course modules, they had to finish creating a course in the LMS and submit it to Todd's team for feedback. In exchange, they could earn a certificate and $2,000, Todd said.

Despite Fast and Furious 9 not releasing until next year, it's been confirmed that the series will end after two more installments.
 As Variety reports, Justin Lin, who directed Fast and Furious 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9, will direct the last two movies in the franchise. Fast and Furious star Vin Diesel suggested in an interview with GamesRadar sister publication Total Film that Fast and Furious 10 would be split into parts, which we now know will conclude the series. That said, Diesel also said spin-offs are "inevitable," and indeed, Universal reportedly has more than one Fast and Furious spin-off in development at the moment.
 Of course, Fast fans won't soon forget the 2019 spin-off Hobbs and Shaw, which starred Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Jason Statham. And if you're wondering whether Hobbs and Shaw is getting a sequel, you need only turn your attention toward the movie's $760 million box-office turnout for the likely answer.
 Fast and Furious 9 was originally set to release back in May of this year, but was delayed all the way to April 2021 in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic. The F9 delay caused the release of the Fast and Furious video game to be postponed until August 7 of this year.
 With F9 still months away, there's no telling when we'll see the tenth and eleventh installments, but it's safe to say Fast and Furious will be a mainstay in theaters for many years to come.

Spencer Davis, the multi-instrumentalist and leader of the band that bore his name, has died at the age of 81. The Spencer Davis Group recorded such hits as "Gimme Some Lovin' " and "I'm a Man." Davis wasn't the lead singer on either song though, giving that job to a teenage Steve Winwood.
 Davis died Monday while being treated for pneumonia, according to his tour manager and friend, Bob Birk, who worked with the musician for decades.
 In a statement to NPR, Birk called him a "highly ethical, very talented, good- hearted, extremely intelligent, generous man."
 Davis was born in Swansea, Wales, where he started singing in a boys' choir. By the time he was in college, he was invested in jazz and rhythm and blues. One day he ran into a young Winwood and his older brother, Muff, playing some country-blues songs at a bar, and Davis was so blown away that he asked the two to join his band immediately. (Davis told the _Phonograph Record_ in 1971 that the elder Winwood had to join the band simply because Steve wasn't old enough to drive yet.)
