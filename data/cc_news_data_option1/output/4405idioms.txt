The reality of this pandemic is finally sinking in. Although it's unfortunate, the fact is that COVID-19 is lasting much longer than any of us presumed. With that, masks have become an essential part of our wardrobe. When we get dressed in the morning, we're suddenly hit the thought, "what mask am I going to wear today?" It's become just as important as leaving the house with our shoes on.                                                                                                                             Here at _Men 's Health_, we take the idea of a good face mask very seriously. We've tested hundreds of them and understand they aren't exactly an ideal outfit topper in terms of comfort and aesthetic. But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wearing a face mask can help stop the spread of COVID-19. And we want this pandemic to end, so as much it sucks, we will continue to wear a mask.                                                                                   The best masks come with a few prerequisites. They must be made from a soft, lightweight, and breathable material, preferably moisture-wicking. They must retain their shape to avoid fogging up your glasses and falling off your face. And lastly, their straps should be some sort of elastic for custom comfort. Huckberry's Merino Wool Masks checks off all of those boxes and then some. No wonder why it sold out six times!                                                                                  Lucky for you, after fulfilling their 4,000-person wait list, it's back and available for purchase right now. If you can't bear the idea of wearing a mask, you definitely haven't tried this one. The rugged-yet-stylish outdoor lifestyle brand always delivers high-quality product offerings worth your hard-earned dollars--and this mask is no exception. Made out of merino wool (which has natural moisture-wicking properties), this top-rated mask is breathable, temperature-regulating, and odor-resistant, which makes it ideal for your outdoor workouts.                                                                                    Like many other brands, Huckberry followed the demand of 2020's hottest accessory. It is now available in a single, two-pack and four-pack, along with a newer tri-fold style. They even came out with new colors of charcoal and blue so you can mix it up depending on your outfit of the day.                                                                                  To further convince you on this mask, Huckberry is donating 10% of the proceeds to the Opportunity Fund's Small Business Relief Fund: a program established to support small businesses hit by the economic effects of COVID-19, especially those run by women, people of color, and immigrants. They have sold over 20,000 face masks, making a huge difference for the many small businesses that applied to this program. But act fast--this popular face mask won't stay in stock for long.

Then there is just the gut-level feel of the election. Trump won in 2016 by receiving less than 80,000 more votes than Clinton in the Rust Belt states that swung the Electoral College with significant third-party candidates on the ballot. Remove those candidates and add in the pandemic, the resultant economic downturn, and the various racial justice protests, and you erase more of his support than the movement of some Evan McMullin (and maybe Gary Johnson) voters back into the Trump column can possibly compensate for.

“We don’t know what’s coming over the next few months and next year, so for me it’s just about being as proactive as you possibly can and upskilling yourself as an individual,” he said.                                                                                    Cinemas, like other businesses requiring the close proximity of people to make ends meet, have struggled since being allowed to reopen in July. The delay in the release of the next James Bond film “No Time To Die” didn’t help, prompting many cinemas to temporarily close their doors again.                                                                                    Though the furlough program prevented mass unemployment at a time when the British economy shrank by nearly a quarter, the jobless rate has edged up during the pandemic, from a four-decade low of 3.8% to 4.5%, with the likes of British Airways, Royal Mail and Rolls-Royce all laying off thousands.                                                                                     “The Job Retention Scheme was a lifeline but this is a jobs crisis that’s stretching out over time,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, the outgoing head of the Confederation for British Industry.

As soon as the Republicans got hold of that memo, they realized that it was explosive. Why? Many of the late ballots the Democrats aimed to invalidate in Florida had been sent by military voters, and the idea of discarding the votes of service personnel was repellent to all Americans. Former Secretary of State James Baker, who was overseeing the Florida recount for Bush, swiftly denounced the Democratic plot against the soldiers, saying: "Here we have ... these brave young men and women serving us overseas. And the postmark on their ballot is one day late. And you're going to deny him the right to vote?"          Never mind the grammar; Baker's message was powerful — and was followed by equally indignant messages in the following days from a parade of prominent Bush backers including retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, the immensely popular commander of U.S. troops in the Desert Storm invasion that drove Saddam Hussein's army out of Kuwait. Fortuitously, Schwarzkopf happened to be on the scene as a resident of Florida.          As Jeffrey Toobin recounted in _Too Close to Call_ , his superb book on the Florida 2000 fiasco, the Democrats had no choice but to retreat. "I would give the benefit of the doubt to ballots coming in from military personnel," conceded then-Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Gore's running mate, during a defensive appearance on _Meet the Press_. But Toobin says Gore soon realized that to reject military ballots would render him unable to serve as commander in chief — and that it would be morally wrong.          Fast-forward to 2020, when many of the same figures on the Republican side are now poised to argue that absentee ballots, which will include many thousands of military votes — should not be counted after Election Day, even if they arrived on time. Among those Republicans is Justice Kavanaugh, who made the opposite argument as a young lawyer working for Bush in Florida 20 years ago. Nobody expects legal consistency or democratic morality from a hack like him, but someone should force him and his Republican colleagues to own this moment of shame.          Who can do that? Joe Biden's campaign and the Democratic Party ought to be exposing the Republican assault on military ballots — and, by the same token, every legally valid absentee ballot — every day. But the Democrats notoriously lack the killer instinct of their partisan rivals, even at a moment of existential crisis like this one.          No, this is clearly a job for the ex-Republicans of the Lincoln Project, who certainly recall what happened in Florida in 2000. They have the attitude and aptitude of political assassins. They surely know how to raise hell over an issue like military votes — and now is the time to exercise those aggressive skills in defense of democracy.           _To find out more about Joe Conason and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at www.creators.com._

If I have to go out on a limb, my prediction is for a Biden win, clear enough that we'll know it on Election Night, though the final tally may not be known for a few days, and Trump may contest the results. The Democrats have a good chance of flipping the Senate, or at least gaining one or two seats. If the Republicans keep control of the Senate, it's very likely they'll start preparing the ground for an investigation of Biden, with an eye to impeachment, even before the dust has settled — not with the goal of removing him from office (that would give us President Harris!), but of keeping the administration hamstrung.

BOSTON (AP) — Students at a Massachusetts university have been told to shelter in place for a week in response to a cluster of coronavirus cases on campus. The order at Assumption University in Worcester took effect Friday and comes after eight new positive cases among students in the past week, school officials said. In addition, more than 100 students are in quarantine. Students will be restricted to their dorm rooms except for medical emergencies, twice-a-week COVID tests, and to pick up meals, President Francesco Cesareo said in a statement. Classes will continue remotely. Students who violate the shelter-in-place order will be sent home, according to the university. If they leave campus on their own, they will not be able to return until January. “I realize the inconvenience that the shelter-in-place will cause students, faculty and staff, however this mutual decision by the Worcester Department of Public Health and the university is a necessary step to promote the health and safety of the campus and Worcester communities,” Cesareo said. The Roman Catholic school has about 2,400 students. ___ HIGH RISK COMMUNITIES The number of Massachusetts communities considered at high-risk for the spread of the coronavirus has grown to 121, up from 77 a week ago, according to state data released Thursday. Communities in the high-risk category are colored red in a statewide map and have seen on average more than eight new cases each day per 100,000 residents over a 14-day period. The latest map is based on data collected from Oct. 11 to Oct. 24. Most of the state's largest cities are in the red, as are many small towns including Buckland, Berkley and Townsend. Ten cities and towns were downgraded from high-risk to moderate-risk.

STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) — A prosecutor said Friday that Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel will not face a second trial in the killing of Martha Moxley, an announcement that came 45 years to the day after the teenager was bludgeoned to death in her wealthy Connecticut neighborhood.Chief State’s Attorney Richard Colangelo Jr. said at a hearing at Stamford Superior Court that the case could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.Skakel, a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy’s widow, Ethel Kennedy, was convicted of murder in 2002 and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. Several appeals followed. After serving 11 years behind bars, Skakel was freed in 2013 on $1.2 million bail after a judge overturned his conviction, saying his trial lawyer failed to adequately represent him.The state Supreme Court upheld that ruling in 2018, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the state’s appeal last year.Moxley’s brother, John, said outside the courthouse that he still believes Skakel killed his sister but he and their mother, Dorthy, are at peace with the decision not to seek a second trial.“His life will never be the same. Mine will never be the same. I wouldn’t want to walk a mile in his shoes,” Moxley said.Skakel did not comment during the hearing or outside court. His attorney, Stephan Seeger, said Skakel is innocent.“He’s been innocent from day one. This crime should have never been something that ended up in a trial in the first place,” Seeger said.The case drew wide attention because of the Kennedy name, Skakel’s rich family, numerous theories about who killed Moxley and the brutal way in which she died. Several other people, including Skakel’s brother Tommy Skakel who denied any role in the killing, have been mentioned as possible killers. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been one of Skakel’s most prominent defenders.A retrial would have presented several difficulties for prosecutors. There was a lack of forensic and eyewitness evidence against Skakel. A new alibi witness emerged. A key witness who said Skakel confessed is dead. And the Moxley family is leery of going through another trial.On the night of the killing, Martha Moxley and other teens in the Belle Haven neighborhood were out doing pre-Halloween pranks and had visited the Skakel home, police said.Her body was found the next day on her family’s estate, across the street from the Skakel home. She had been beaten with a 6-iron owned by the Skakel family and stabbed in the throat with a piece of the golf club’s shattered shaft, police said.At Skakel’s trial, prosecutors suggested Skakel was angry with Martha because she had spurned his advances while having a sexual liaison with his brother Tommy.Michael Skakel said he was miles away from the crime scene watching a “Monty Python” television show with others at the likely time Moxley was killed. But prosecutors maintain he could have killed her after returning home that night.Police interviewed numerous witnesses, but the case went cold.Interest was revived in 1993, when author Dominick Dunne published a novel, “A Season in Purgatory,” based on the murder.Then, in 1998, former Los Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman, who gained notoriety in the O.J. Simpson murder case, published his own book, “Murder in Greenwich,” which asserted Michael Skakel killed Moxley in a jealous rage after seeing Thomas Skakel kiss her.A one-judge grand jury was announced that same year to investigate the killing, resulting in Skakel’s arrest in 2000 and conviction in 2002.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

2020 has been (and continues to be) incredibly tough for all kinds of reasons, but it will go down as a great year for music, if nothing else. Among the many contenders for album of the year is _Set My Heart on Fire Immediately_ , the lush, inviting fifth studio offering by Perfume Genius, a.k.a. Michael Hadreas.                                                                                                                                The album is hard to easily categorize. Songs sound, at times, like a riff on contemporary artists like Belle & Sebastian and Twin Shadow, and at others like throwbacks to '50s crooners like Roy Orbison. This, Hadreas reveals, was by design: "I wanted the record to sound classic and familiar and warm, but not in a way you could put your finger on."                                                                                                                                As Hadreas prepared for the album's release back in May, he was poised to spend the rest of the year touring. Of course, what happened instead was that _Set My Heart on Fire Immediately_ dropped in the middle of a global pandemic, and joined the ranks of new music releases that people were enjoying solitarily in quarantine.                                                                                     "I'm happy to have that portal to other people," he tells _Men's Health_. "It's weird for me, and I'm sure for everyone else, just because I'm home… Usually when touring, I would put on a very outward-facing part of myself, like 'OK, I'm out in the world, I'm probably going to be out for a year, I need to let go of my inside-the-house person.' Maybe those are closer together for other people, but for me they're not. It's really weird for me to be home, and then do a live-stream and feel like now I have to be Performer Guy. It's strange phasing in and out of it. But I'm really happy that I can still conjure up the energy to sing and dance and perform."                                                                                    In between the stints where he assumes his more outgoing stage persona, Hadreas says life has been "too chaotic" to work on anything new directly (although an album of remixes featuring Jamie xx is said to be in the works). For the most part, his time indoors has been taken up by practicing a kind of dance-inspired meditation while listening to ambient organ music by the composer Sarah Devachi. "My boyfriend went out of town for two weeks and that's all I've been doing, just rolling around the house," he says. "Truly, for hours a day. I think I needed some kind of reset. A recalibration."

You can buy tickets regularly, wear a mask and social distance in the theater (theaters with assigned seating do this automatically and others have taped off seats and rows). Or, some chains like AMC and Cinemark and some theaters are renting screens for private viewing parties for up to 20 people. Pricing varies by movie (new movies tend to start at $149 whereas back catalog classics can be $99) and location. Cinemark is even offering " private gaming party " pricing ($99 for 2 hours) where you can play your own video game on the big screen.

_The Mandalorian_ itself also subtly set up Boba's return, and in retrospect, it's likely that was the entire reason there was an episode set on Tatooine last season. By ending that episode, "The Gunslinger," with an unidentified character walking up to assassin Fennec Shand, not far away from where Boba apparently died, the show obviously wanted us to speculate that his return was imminent. Then, rather than simply having Boba Fett pop up in season two's cold open, _The Mandalorian_ devotes much of its season premiere to gradually teasing his appearance. It was a slow burn, so that by the time the moment finally comes, it's something we've been anticipating and not a sudden sharp turn left.

It's the hardest one on the list to get by far though, because you can't just pick it up like you can the rest, and it's not marked on the map. Well, it is, but not in the right place.
                                                                                  Firstly, wait till shortly before 2am in-game. Fast travel to Cannon Street tube station in the City of London, then head south to the River Thames. Underneath the building to the south of the tube station is a walkway, just past a Staroger Coffee shop with  wooden decking. You'll know you're in the right place if there's an orange ladder descending into the river. At 2am, jump off the side, then turn around and you'll see a mossy doorway along from the ladder, with a padlock on.                                                                                  If it's 2am, you'll be able to open up this door, head inside, and grab the mask from the room of mannequins. This will have teleported you further along the river towards London Bridge. You'll recognise this room if you've completed the story, along with the previously inaccesible mask.                                                                                  The "correct" way to solve this small puzzle is to find the QR code you can see on  one of the posters in the room during the mission when you're hacking the cameras. Scan it with your phone in real life and it'll give you a pop-up that says "0/6 Find my private party @ 2am". You're not given any clues to the location though, that part is left up to you. But we've explained how to do it above anyway, so enjoy!
