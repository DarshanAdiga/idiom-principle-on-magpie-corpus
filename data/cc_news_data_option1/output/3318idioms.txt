A Silicon Valley-based Indian-American couple has released a musical campaign video targeting Indian-Americans in the battleground states and urging them to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris.On the last day of the four-day Democratic National Convention on Thursday, Biden, 77, formally accepted the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party.Harris, 55, scripted history in US politics as she became the first Indian-American and Black woman to get a major party's vice-presidential nomination on the third day of the virtual Democratic National Convention on Wednesday.&quot;Living in Silicon Valley, we are at heart innovators; we have applied that creativity to rapidly grow the outreach to key South Asian voter groups in support of Vice President Biden. It is extremely important that we all come together as a community to fight for what is right,&quot; Vinita Bhutoria said after the release of the video on Friday.Vinita, along with her tech entrepreneur husband Ajay Jian Bhutoria, starts the video saying, &quot;America Ka Neta Kaisa Ho: Jo Biden Jaisa Ho.&quot;The political couple, who had earlier hosted Jill Biden at their house early this year for fundraising, is currently working on three unique video adverts in support of the Biden-Harris campaign. The first of the series was released on Friday.&quot;Indo-Americans are the crucial margin of victory in Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, Wisconsin, and Nevada,&quot; said Ajay.Running into 143 seconds, in the backdrop of music, Indian-Americans in various languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Punjabi, and Bengali, are appealing to their community members in the battleground States to vote and support Biden and his running mate Harris in the November presidential elections.&quot;As an absolutely essential swing vote, it is essential that Indo-American political representation increases. We have made immense leaps forward, but we will continue working hard to further push the envelope of what is possible,&quot; Ajay said.The video highlights the culture of Indo-Americans in the USA connecting to mainstream politics and highlights the engagement of all ages of Indo-American community, said Raj, a young Indian-American student from Claremont McKenna College in California.&quot;It shows hope for the future for the Indo American community. The video shows the ocean of political activism and new waves by Indian Americans. The video connects people from different parts of India living in the USA and speaking in multiple languages, all united in the fight to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,&quot; Raj said.&quot;This is the first time ever in US elections, the Indian community is coming forward in big numbers to publicly show their engagement in the democratic process and candidate preferences. This is a big change from just being a donor or campaign volunteer. This election onwards the impact of the whole South Asian Diaspora in American politics will never be the same,&quot; said Neil Banerjee, a Silicon Valley technology executive.The video was created by Ritesh, founder of Awesome TV and his team, based in New York.&quot;We wanted to inspire all South Asian American Indians to be involved and support candidates that support our causes!&quot; said Ritesh.The outreach is supported by South Asians for Biden, Impact Fund, They See US Blue, Indian leadership council, and will be released by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) for the Biden team, a statement said.The first video was gaining attraction on various South Asian social media groups.

George does have some legitimately impressive playoff moments under his belt. He pushed LeBron James, at the absolute peak of his powers, to seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals. That isn't nothing. But it's been so long since George pulled off anything like that in the postseason that the self-imposed nickname, for the time being, doesn't seem overly appropriate. George plays for a championship favorite now, though. If he wants to earn it, the opportunity is in front of him.

Last week I had my right knee upgraded to the new Ronco XL-7000 at Bixby Hospital, and it's coming along fine. It's a little slow in the straightaways but makes up for it in the curves. I'm thinking of keeping it.
   
 Throughout this ordeal the hospital staff has been nothing but outstanding in my care. I cannot possibly thank them enough, as well as Dr. Michael Diment and his team. I was given a virus test five days before my admittance, but who knows what happened subsequently. Yet, without fail, nearly every caregiver upon seeing me dons a mask as they entered my room and told me I did not have to do that. My best response was, "It's OK. I might need you again in the future." I was a complete stranger to most of them, yet they put their life and that of their family at risk for me. They will do that for you and yours as well.
   
 The modern American's role during this outbreak is identical to that of the malaria mosquito. The only difference is we have fewer legs. The virus cannot spread without our help. This virus is insidious! Many who have beaten it are left with a need for new lungs, kidneys, hearts, brains or unending fatigue. The numerous little blood clots are what gets you.
   
 Most adults and kids have no ill effects at all and that is the most insidious trait of this scourge. You spread the virus without knowing it. Your kids may fair well going to school but their ability to spread it may be unmatched. When that happens, the "cure" is to send them home to their families, perhaps throwing grandma under the bus.
   
 This plague is temporary. We will inevitably find a vaccine or effective treatment. Other countries like Taiwan or New Zealand are experiencing little or no deaths. We can accomplish the same by Election Day by simply social distancing, wearing masks and implementing total national shutdown for as long as six to eight weeks. That's what the successful countries have done.
   
 Our helter-skelter shutdowns have helped locally. We are dragging this out for who knows how long. Too many medical people have fallen already. Save the rest of them for those you love: social distance, wear a mask. Thank you.

 Gering then took a 5-2 lead with a 4-run fourth inning. Gianni Aguilar led off with double followed by Schlothauer reaching on an error. Both Aguilar and Schlothauer scored on errors to go up 3-2. Lohr and Brylee Dean each scored to make the score 5-2.
 Aurora came back to tie the game with three in the fifth and then won the game with a walk-off single to score the winning run.
 Offensively, Gering had five hits. Abby Brady had a home run while Gianni Aguilar and Schlothauer each had doubles.
 Gering, 2-3, will be back in action Thursday when they host Scottsbluff at Oregon Trail Park.

Ann Williams Nelson   October 7, 1946 - August 14, 2020   San Diego   Ann Williams Nelson, 73, passed away peacefully at her home on August 14, 2020, after an extended battle with cancer. The daughter of the late Warren and Ann Williams, Ann was born and raised in Lakewood, Ohio. Ann attended Texas Christian University and University of Arizona, where she followed in her mother's footsteps, pledging the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and forging an early dedication to women's organizations.After moving to San Diego, Ann met the love of her life, Tiff Nelson, on the dance floor at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot officer's club. They married in 1978 and celebrated with a lively reception aboard the Bahia Belle. Her 42-year marriage to Tiff was one for the storybooks, with a wonderful mix of love, loyalty, and partnership.Ann was a devoted elementary school teacher in San Diego City Schools for 35 years. She finished her tenure as a well-loved second-grade teacher at Bay Park Elementary and was known for introducing her students to music and stitchery.Ann was dedicated to serving others throughout her life and was an active member of the Junior League of San Diego, National Charity League, P.E.O. Sisterhood, Republican Women's Club, Red Hats, Kappa Alpha Theta Alumnae, and the La Jolla Garden Club. A direct descendant of Stephen Hopkins, she was proud of her American heritage; she served on the board of the La Jolla Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and was a member of the Mayflower Society. She was devoted to researching her family genealogy and helping others with their own family history.Often described as "one of a kind," Ann lit up a room with her larger than life personality. She loved entertaining and was known for hosting fabulous parties. Her annual Blue Angels party has been attended by many of the same lifelong friends for over forty years and will not be the same without her. She also loved hosting Sunday night dinners for family and close friends.Ann adored her small, but close-knit family and was always diligent about keeping up longstanding family traditions. She was especially close with her only child, Andrea, with whom she spoke daily. She loved having her family regularly drop in for dinners and dips in the pool. She was especially proud to be a "Nana" to her grandson Connor, who loved her dearly and had a special trove of books and toys reserved just for her. She spent years diligently collecting and embroidering a full wardrobe for her eagerly-anticipated newborn granddaughter Mandy and was overjoyed to have a little girl complete their family.      Ann will be greatly missed by her husband Tiff Nelson; daughter Andrea and husband Zach Myers; sister Cynthia and husband Joe Cervone of Chicago, IL; sister-in-law Rita Williams of Cleveland, OH; and sister-in-law Page Tighe of Palm Beach, FL.

In lieu of flowers, she requested that donations be made in her name to the Junior League of San Diego, 210 Maple Street, San Diego, CA 92103. www.jlsd.org

It went better than anyone could have dreamed. Not only did Bernardo hit the ground running but he never stopped and even managed to make up for the loss of Kevin De Bruyne for most of the year. To anyone who watched the team that season as they won three titles and were on course for a quadruple until that agonising Champions League exit at the hands of Tottenham, their best player was obvious.
 Unfortunately for City and Guardiola, success is rarely guaranteed with such a move.
 Kyle Walker started strongly that season but fatigue got the better of him as winter hit, causing him to be dropped at Christmas after one poor performance too many. Bernardo couldn't repeat the trick this season either, with the mental and physical strain from his previous campaign that was extended with Portugal at the UEFA Nations League not helping his bid for consistency in the most recent campaign.

Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) chief Mustafa Kamal. Photo: File
 Pak Sarzameen Party Chairman Mustafa Kamal lashed out at the Sindh government for what he called 'robbing' the district governments of their powers by dividing the mega city of Karachi into seven parts. He also dressed down the federal government for creating a committee to oversee Karachi's issues, which he termed ‘a tactic to buy time’.  
 The Sindh cabinet, earlier this week, had given a go-ahead to establishing a seventh district in Karachi after bifurcating the existing district West - a decision that didn’t go down well with other political parties, including the PSP.
 “The Sindh government divested the city of its powers after the Eighteenth Amendment by centralising those powers with itself. And, on the other hand, it has robbed the district governments of their powers by slicing the city into seven parts,” said Kamal, speaking on _Geo News_ current affairs programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath’ on Friday.
 “Karachi is a mega city. It used to be 18 decentralised towns.”
 The PSP chairman argued that provinces were not empowered as a result of the 18th Amendment and instead it made the chief minister powerful to the extent that you may call him a ‘dictator’.
 Disputing the usefulness of the 18th Amendment at the district level, he said the CM has concentrated the powers in his office without letting them trickle down to the grassroots levels.
 He pointed out that provincial autonomy means that cities, districts, union councils, villages and citizens of that province get more powers, but it is not the case.
 He also highlighted that money that a chief minister receives from the National Finance Commission award exclusively remains at the disposal of the CM, which he may or may not dole out to the districts.
 A Provincial Finance Commission award is the need of the hour, he suggested.
 Kamal had another suggestion for the provincial government, which was to reverse the bifurcation of the city to ‘one district plus 18 towns’, as this will help resolve the city’s civic issues, including solid waste management and other maintenance irritants.
 But unfortunately, he added, today’s leadership is busy with corruption without fulfilling its responsibilities.
 Replying to a question asking what he will do if put in place to play a role for Karachi, Kamal said, “I wouldn’t get involved in corruption. I will utilize the city government’s funds and employees, who draw millions of rupees in salaries, to their fullest.”
 With all the resources and powers currently available, the city can be well managed, he added.
 The PSP also distrusted the committee formed by the federal government, saying, “I am unsure that the committee will be helpful in resolving Karachi’s problems. It’s because committees traditionally have not been as worthwhile as for this one to be credible.”
 He was of the view that the committee was created as the Karachi issue is currently hot and on the table, which has put pressure on the political parties. He claimed the committee was set up only to release the pressure.
 Saying there is no need for any committee, Kamal said all the issues of Karachi would stand resolved if everyone does what they are supposed to.
 “The world is headed to the moon and we are forming a committee to clean the city,” he added, terming the formation of the committee a mere tactic to ‘buy more time’.  
 He also slammed the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MPAs and MNAs from the province who failed to ‘penetrate to grassroots levels.'
 "That’s why no one knows that the PTI has 14 MNAs and 25 MPAs here – it’s definitely led to a vacuum," he said.
 Kamal also flayed the MQM, saying the party managed the city’s affairs for the last 32 years but they failed in playing their due role for the city's betterment. “If the money and resources available with the mayor had been appropriately consumed without any corruption, the city would have been different now,” he argued.
 In 2013, he added, when the districts were being demarcated, and MQM were a part of the government, they, including the governor, should have quit their positions in protest, he said.
 “Had they refused to agree [to formation of the new districts of Karachi], the city wouldn’t have been so devastated,” he added.

Over the years the media industry has changed drastically, however the important role newspapers, and all local media, play in a community has not.
 Local newspapers are the heart and soul of this great country. These community newspapers and their reporters cover the local school board meetings, city council and county commissioners meetings, the local church activities, high school musicals, local sporting events and so much more.
 They are also a great place for young journalists to get their first taste of serving their readers. Sadly, between 2008 and 2019, the number of reporters covering stories decreased by about 36,000, according to the Pew Research Center.
 Since 2004 over 2,100 newspapers have closed or merged, according to the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media. Most of these were smaller dailies and weeklies.
 Some may say, “So what, we have national news?”
 National news organizations will swoop into a community, if the story is big enough, and provide a few minutes of coverage. They will not hold your city council members or local officials accountable.
 Your local newspaper will be at those meetings, understand better how the decisions made will impact you and follow up. The local reporter will be at community events, tell the story of your neighbors and keep you up-to-date on local activities.

 The brief, glorious moment when tomatoes are everywhere marks the culinary apex of summer. This solstice is especially fleeting for heirloom tomatoes, the high-maintenance wing of the tomato clan. Too watery and delicate to preserve, heirlooms can only be enjoyed raw. Which means they must be enjoyed now.
 Heirlooms have shorter shelf lives than \"normal\" hybrid tomatoes, and they are harder to grow and less productive, making them more expensive. The heirlooms at my farmers market are worth every penny. I've been a big spender all summer, and finally my own patch is starting to ripen.
 I've got Ox Heart, Black Krim, Brandywine, Thirsty Girl, White Peach, Striped German and others. These aren't the lipstick-red, perfectly round slicers that you'd put on a sandwich, or the dense, dry paste tomatoes that in a few weeks I'll simmer into large batches of sauce. Heirlooms come in as many shapes as clouds, as many colors as the rainbow, with mildly tangy flavors and sweet, earthy aromas.
 I keep my heirlooms closer than my friends and enemies, organized like perishable jewels, usually on a large plate but not in a pile, keeping track of which ones are soft. I don't refrigerate or cook my heirlooms. They are for room-temperature enjoyment only.
 I can't think of any more delicious way to enjoy a summer heirloom -- and summer itself -- than a plate of caprese, the Italian salad that pairs a slice of tomato with a slice of mozzarella and a leaf or two of basil. These accompaniments flatter the heirloom, as lime and salt complete a shot of tequila, and are just as intoxicating.
 Beyond this three-ingredient caprese quorum, most renditions will include salt, olive oil and balsamic vinegar, either red or white -- white balsamic is made from white grapes and lately, because of trademark issues, goes by White Italian Condiment. Whatever we call white balsamic, I prefer it to the red. It's just as aromatic but less dominant. And, call me crazy, but I prefer tucking the basil between the tomato and the cheese. On top of the tomato, that basil leaf deflects the oil, salt and vinegar. And in so doing, it blocks the proper flavor from developing.
 After weeks of studying, preparing, consuming and obsessing about caprese, my garden was depleted, and I went to the farmers market to buy more ingredients. While gathering bunches of basil from a vendor I barely knew named Jamie, I heard him mention that I looked like a man with caprese on his mind.
 As Jamie was so tuned in to the caprese wavelength, I asked how he serves it at home.
 He mixes purple and green basil on alternate pieces of caprese, along with different colored tomatoes. It makes a more colorful plate, he says. He's also a stickler for balsamic reduction, rather than the straight vinegar. He likes the syrupy consistency, how it sticks to the cheese and tomatoes.
 To make your own balsamic reduction, simply heat a quantity of red or white balsamic in a heavy bottomed saucepan until it's reduced by at least half. Some recipes call for sweetening the reduction, but I find it sweet enough.
 Caprese is usually served as some kind of towering pile, but you can also chop the basil, mozzarella and tomato into utensil-sized bits and sprinkle with salt, olive oil and some kind of balsamic.
 Fresh mozzarella is about as cheap as fresh heirloom tomatoes. Unless you have a cow, a cheese shop or a trust fund, your caprese consumption might be limited only by your budget.
 But if you don't have a mozzarella budget, or if you're vegan, or even if you're just someone who needs a new way to express your heirloom addiction, here is a salad called Heirloom Tomato Juice. So juicy it's drunk as much as it's eaten, the salad is as refreshing as a bowl of gazpacho, and requires only a fraction of the prep time.
 Heirloom Tomato Juice   Serves 4   • 2 English cucumbers, sliced into ½-inch rounds   • ¼ of a large sweet onion, sliced to ⅛-inch or less   • 3 cups chopped heirloom tomatoes   • 1/2 cups olive oil   • ¼ cup balsamic vinegar   • 1 tablespoon salt
 Add the cucumbers to a bowl, along with 2 teaspoons of salt and the onions, teasing the slices apart into individual crescents. Toss. Add the tomatoes, oil and balsamic, and toss again. Taste, add the remainder of the salt if needed.
 Wait about 20 minutes for the juices to get flowing. It happens so fast, you can see it with the naked eye. Serve in bowls. When the chunks are done, sip the juice from the bowls.

Avoid full cycle (zero-100 percent) charging. Instead, top-up your phone more regularly with partial charges. Ending a charge at 80 percent is better for the battery than topping all the way up to 100 percent. Don’t let the battery drain completely either.Overnight charging is generally a bad idea, and certainly not recommended with fast charging technologies. Using a fast charger also degrades the battery quickly.Heat is the battery killer. Don’t cover your phone when charging and keep it out of hot places. If your phone gets uncomfortably warm while playing games or using the camera, stop what you’re doing and let it cool down.Turn your phone off when charging if you can, and try not to use it even if it’s on. You definitely shouldn’t play games or watch videos, to avoid mini charging cycles.

But the strength of a marriage is not what you know on your wedding day. It’s how you deal with the nagging annoyances that pop up over the years like gophers in a bed of roses.
 We’ve survived our share of gophers with no real regrets. We married, of course, for better or for worse. But our wedding vows did not cover haircuts.
 One surprising side effect of the coronavirus quarantine is an increase in the growth rate of human hair. Especially for men.
 This is not a scientific fact, just a simple observation. In the past six months, I’ve not set foot in a salon and my husband hasn’t been to a barber. In that time, my hair has grown a few inches. And his hair has grown twice as much as mine. I look like I need a haircut. But he looks like a stunt double for Bigfoot.
 Or he did. Not any more.
 We’ve each dealt differently with our bumper crop of hair. I put mine up in ponytail. And he ordered a set of hedge trimmers. I mean, hair clippers.
 “How exactly will you manage to cut your own hair?” I said.
 “I won’t,” he said. “You will.”
 “HAH!” I laughed. “Not a chance! You would hate it and I’d never hear the end of it!”
 He didn’t argue, just went back to watching a Giants’ game on TV, with cardboard cut-out fans in the empty seats behind homeplate. Then the clippers showed up and he tried again.
 “C’mon,” he begged, waving the instructions. “I don’t care how it looks. It’ll feel cooler!”
 Persuasive, isn’t he?
 “Fine!” I said. “Go out on the patio. It’s gonna be a mess!”

 As Biden laid out an appeal for national unity and cast himself as an “ally of the light, not the darkness,” Trump delivered his sharpest broadsides yet at Biden, casting him as a “radical” and “socialist” whose victory would bring about “left-wing fascism.”
 Focusing on his rival's economic and immigration agenda, Trump repeatedly exaggerated Biden’s positions for greatest effect.
 “Every election is a binary choice, and this one is no different,” Murtaugh said.

Many would think that the $300 billion behind the stimulus checks Americans received earlier this summer would be funded through tax dollars. According to _CNBC_, that is the consensus and foremost reason for tax dollars, but it isn't as simple as that. In a post from Robert Exley Jr., he has Sahil Bloom, Vice President of Altamont Capital Partners, run-down where most of that money released by the Federal Reserve originates. He includes some updating on the idea of "printing money." Watch the video here.
 As Bloom points out, the solution to the funding is far simpler than expected. After Congress passes the legislation with the stimulus payments inside, the Department of Treasury takes over to and issue bonds and notes to promise to pay back the money. So yes, most of your direct stimulus payments come from loans or IOUs in a way, but it doesn't end there. Since we're a deficit spending economy, we have to have that third-party lender to help out. We've borrowed from China and other nations in the past, but the source of the funds could be anywhere, according to Bloom. But in his example, he goes to the Federal Reserve.
 The Federal Reserve is where the "money printing" comes into play. While the old days would see money printed, today the Fed can digitally move a decimal point and buy the bonds from the Treasury. "We live in a digital age. So really money is just numbers on a screen," Bloom says, according to Exley at _CNBC_.
 The Fed would then place the debt on its balance sheet, keep it as an asset down the road, leaving it to join the growing total. As Bloom points out in the video, the current total this year is around $7 trillion.
 He then explains inflation and how it could come into play, defining it as when the cost of goods and services increases, while the value of the money falls. It's how we would see eye-opening prices for a loaf of bread in other nations hit by hyperinflation. Inflation also is just a natural state of the economy growing across decades, with bread prices in the U.S. going from a dime in 1930 to close to $4.00 currently.

 Stimulus funding is being used to plug a hole according to Bloom, so inflation growing too quickly isn't a fear in the current moment. But it could be in the future, where too much is in circulation and not enough goods to spend it on.
 So the stimulus, while it seems like you don't need it or shouldn't take it because of the growing debt or tax rates, that's not the case. The money is put out to be spent and return to the economy, softening the blows of the ongoing pandemic. Will we see a second stimulus? It doesn't seem possible at the moment, but Congress can't give up yet.

A Silicon Valley-based Indian-American couple has released a musical campaign video targeting Indian-Americans in the battleground states and urging them to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his Indian-origin running mate Senator Kamala Harris.
 On the last day of the four-day Democratic National Convention on Thursday, Biden, 77, formally accepted the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party.
 Harris, 55, scripted history in US politics as she became the first Indian- American and Black woman to get a major party's vice-presidential nomination on the third day of the virtual Democratic National Convention on Wednesday.
 "Living in Silicon Valley, we are at heart innovators; we have applied that creativity to rapidly grow the outreach to key South Asian voter groups in support of Vice President Biden. It is extremely important that we all come together as a community to fight for what is right," Vinita Bhutoria said after the release of the video on Friday.
 Vinita, along with her tech entrepreneur husband Ajay Jian Bhutoria, starts the video saying, "America Ka Neta Kaisa Ho: Jo Biden Jaisa Ho."
 The political couple, who had earlier hosted Jill Biden at their house early this year for fundraising, is currently working on three unique video adverts in support of the Biden-Harris campaign. The first of the series was released on Friday.
 "Indo-Americans are the crucial margin of victory in Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, Wisconsin, and Nevada," said Ajay.
 Running into 143 seconds, in the backdrop of music, Indian-Americans in various languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Punjabi, and Bengali, are appealing to their community members in the battleground States to vote and support Biden and his running mate Harris in the November presidential elections.
 "As an absolutely essential swing vote, it is essential that Indo-American political representation increases. We have made immense leaps forward, but we will continue working hard to further push the envelope of what is possible," Ajay said.
 The video highlights the culture of Indo-Americans in the USA connecting to mainstream politics and highlights the engagement of all ages of Indo-American community, said Raj, a young Indian-American student from Claremont McKenna College in California.
 "It shows hope for the future for the Indo American community. The video shows the ocean of political activism and new waves by Indian Americans. The video connects people from different parts of India living in the USA and speaking in multiple languages, all united in the fight to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris," Raj said.
 "This is the first time ever in US elections, the Indian community is coming forward in big numbers to publicly show their engagement in the democratic process and candidate preferences. This is a big change from just being a donor or campaign volunteer. This election onwards the impact of the whole South Asian Diaspora in American politics will never be the same," said Neil Banerjee, a Silicon Valley technology executive.
 The video was created by Ritesh, founder of Awesome TV and his team, based in New York.
 "We wanted to inspire all South Asian American Indians to be involved and support candidates that support our causes!" said Ritesh.
 The outreach is supported by South Asians for Biden, Impact Fund, They See US Blue, Indian leadership council, and will be released by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) for the Biden team, a statement said.
 The first video was gaining attraction on various South Asian social media groups.

Terry Sullivan, the campaign manager for the 2016 presidential campaign of Sen. Marco Rubio, who found himself on the receiving end of similar attacks, said Trump "only knows one way to campaign.”
 “He floods the zone with his message via events and Twitter attacking his opponents," he said. "It’s worked for him in the past so, in his mind, there is no reason it won’t work again.”
 Trump has torn up other norms in politics, so abandoning the traditional calendar is hardly a surprise — and could help him as he tries to overcome his deficit with voters.
 “The Trump team wisely chose to take an aggressive approach to the Dems' big week and dominated local news by traveling to secondary markets in key battleground states,” said Scott Reed, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s political strategist. “Now that we are within 100 days, every day is a battle to win the day, the small sliver of undecided voters.

 The _Disney_ alum told Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s _Essentials Radio_ on Wednesday that she wrote her breakup song _Slide Away_ only two months after her top secret wedding with Liam Hemsworth.
 “I wrote _Slide Away_ before my breakup. I wrote _Slide Away_ in February of the year before. I just keep speaking these things into existence," Cyrus shared.
 As a result, the songstress learned looked within searching for happiness.
 “I’ve decided to use my language to love myself, and to really create what I want to be my reality. Because otherwise, I keep doing the opposite. I burnt my house down with my words,” the Hannah Montana star said referring to her song Malibu, which she released a year prior to when her house with Hemsworth burned down in the Woolsey Fire.
 “I was talking yesterday about where you apply your attention determines how you feel. And I think that’s what I mean by definitely joking about me burning my house down with my words,” she continued. “But I do believe in where we put our attention determines our faith.”
 Cyrus and Hemsworth had a decade-long whirlwind romance. The two tied the knot in December 2018, however parted ways just seven months after. Cyrus then released _Slide Away,_ six days after divorce announcement.
 “Miley and Liam haven’t talked much since their divorce,” a source recently told Us Weekly. “Liam was hurt by Miley moving on with new love interests shortly after they broke up.”
 yrus said on the Apple Music show on Wednesday that she tries “to not get lost in emotion” after dealing with heartbreak, so she grabs a pen and paper to keep her from doing so.

ATLANTA — Traffic is back to pre-pandemic levels in most of Georgia, state Commissioner of Transportation Russell McMurry reported Thursday.
 With the economy steadily reopening, the flow of cars and trucks along Georgia’s rural roads and interstate highways is back to normal, McMurry told members of the State Transportation Board during its monthly meeting Thursday. In fact, truck traffic is actually above normal in some parts of the state, he said.
 Only in metro Atlanta is traffic still down significantly from levels seen before March, when the coronavirus pandemic hit the state and prompted Gov. Brian Kemp to issue a statewide stay-at-home order. That mandate has since been lifted for all but Georgians in long-term care facilities and those with chronic medical conditions.
 Because the metro region accounts for such a large percentage of the vehicles plying Georgia highways, traffic flow statewide is still down 10% to 15% on average, McMurry said. Traffic across the state plummeted by up to half at the height of the economic lockdown.
 McMurry said it’s still unclear how much the reopening of schools for the fall semester will affect traffic flows. He said he would know more by the time he reports back to the transportation board next month.

The brief, glorious moment when tomatoes are everywhere marks the culinary apex of summer. This solstice is especially fleeting for heirloom tomatoes, the high-maintenance wing of the tomato clan. Too watery and delicate to preserve, heirlooms can only be enjoyed raw. Which means they must be enjoyed now.      Heirlooms have shorter shelf lives than "normal" hybrid tomatoes, and they are harder to grow and less productive, making them more expensive. The heirlooms at my farmers market are worth every penny. I've been a big spender all summer, and finally my own patch is starting to ripen.      I've got Ox Heart, Black Krim, Brandywine, Thirsty Girl, White Peach, Striped German and others. These aren't the lipstick-red, perfectly round slicers that you'd put on a sandwich, or the dense, dry paste tomatoes that in a few weeks I'll simmer into large batches of sauce. Heirlooms come in as many shapes as clouds, as many colors as the rainbow, with mildly tangy flavors and sweet, earthy aromas.      I keep my heirlooms closer than my friends and enemies, organized like perishable jewels, usually on a large plate but not in a pile, keeping track of which ones are soft. I don't refrigerate or cook my heirlooms. They are for room-temperature enjoyment only.      I can't think of any more delicious way to enjoy a summer heirloom -- and summer itself -- than a plate of caprese, the Italian salad that pairs a slice of tomato with a slice of mozzarella and a leaf or two of basil. These accompaniments flatter the heirloom, as lime and salt complete a shot of tequila, and are just as intoxicating.      Beyond this three-ingredient caprese quorum, most renditions will include salt, olive oil and balsamic vinegar, either red or white -- white balsamic is made from white grapes and lately, because of trademark issues, goes by White Italian Condiment. Whatever we call white balsamic, I prefer it to the red. It's just as aromatic but less dominant. And, call me crazy, but I prefer tucking the basil between the tomato and the cheese. On top of the tomato, that basil leaf deflects the oil, salt and vinegar. And in so doing, it blocks the proper flavor from developing.      After weeks of studying, preparing, consuming and obsessing about caprese, my garden was depleted, and I went to the farmers market to buy more ingredients. While gathering bunches of basil from a vendor I barely knew named Jamie, I heard him mention that I looked like a man with caprese on his mind.      As Jamie was so tuned in to the caprese wavelength, I asked how he serves it at home.      He mixes purple and green basil on alternate pieces of caprese, along with different colored tomatoes. It makes a more colorful plate, he says. He's also a stickler for balsamic reduction, rather than the straight vinegar. He likes the syrupy consistency, how it sticks to the cheese and tomatoes.      To make your own balsamic reduction, simply heat a quantity of red or white balsamic in a heavy bottomed saucepan until it's reduced by at least half. Some recipes call for sweetening the reduction, but I find it sweet enough.      Caprese is usually served as some kind of towering pile, but you can also chop the basil, mozzarella and tomato into utensil-sized bits and sprinkle with salt, olive oil and some kind of balsamic.      Fresh mozzarella is about as cheap as fresh heirloom tomatoes. Unless you have a cow, a cheese shop or a trust fund, your caprese consumption might be limited only by your budget.      But if you don't have a mozzarella budget, or if you're vegan, or even if you're just someone who needs a new way to express your heirloom addiction, here is a salad called Heirloom Tomato Juice. So juicy it's drunk as much as it's eaten, the salad is as refreshing as a bowl of gazpacho, and requires only a fraction of the prep time.      Heirloom Tomato Juice   Serves 4   • 2 English cucumbers, sliced into ½-inch rounds   • ¼ of a large sweet onion, sliced to ⅛-inch or less   • 3 cups chopped heirloom tomatoes   • 1/2 cups olive oil   • ¼ cup balsamic vinegar   • 1 tablespoon salt      Add the cucumbers to a bowl, along with 2 teaspoons of salt and the onions, teasing the slices apart into individual crescents. Toss. Add the tomatoes, oil and balsamic, and toss again. Taste, add the remainder of the salt if needed.      Wait about 20 minutes for the juices to get flowing. It happens so fast, you can see it with the naked eye. Serve in bowls. When the chunks are done, sip the juice from the bowls.

(AP) - Two newly formed tropical storms could become almost simultaneous threats to the U.S. Gulf Coast early next week. They could even get sucked into an odd dance around each other. Or they could fall apart as they soak the Caribbean and Mexico this weekend.Tropical storms Laura and Marco have such bad and good environments ahead of them that their futures were not clear late Friday. Computer forecast models varied so much that some saw Laura becoming a major hurricane nearing the U.S., while others saw it dissipating.If both storms survive the weekend, the National Hurricane Center forecast that Laura would as head a hurricane toward the central Gulf Coast around Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, while Marco aimed at Texas, though most likely remaining a tropical storm.“A lot of people are going to be impacted by rainfall and storm surge in the Gulf of Mexico,” said Joel Cline, the tropical program coordinator for the National Weather Service. “Since you simply don’t know you really need to make precautions.”Two hurricanes have never appeared in the Gulf of Mexico at the same time, according to records going back to at least 1900, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. The last time two tropical storms were in the Gulf together was in 1959, he said.Because the hurricane center slowed Laura's entrance into the Gulf and moved its track westward, the two storms are now forecast to be together in the Gulf on Tuesday, just before the weaker western storm smacks Texas with Laura making landfall a bit less than a day later.The hurricane center on Friday issued tropical storm warnings for the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. Laura was forecast to hit Puerto Rico on Saturday morning, go over or near the Dominican Republic and Haiti late Saturday and Cuba on Sunday.Laura, which set a record for the earliest 12th named storm of a season when it formed Friday morning, was moving through the northern Leeward Islands late Friday, about 195 miles (315 kilometers) southeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico. It had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) and was heading west at 18 mph (30 kph).The hurricane center also issued a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch for part of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula for Marco, which grew into a tropical storm Friday night.Late Friday, it was centered about 210 miles (340 kilometers) southeast of Cozumel, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph). It was headed northwest at 13 mph (20 kph).If the two storms make it, they could be crowded in the Gulf of Mexico at the same time Tuesday about 550 miles apart. That would leave open some weird possibilities, including the storms rotating around each other in a tropical two-step, pulling in closer to each other, nudging each other, weakening each other or — far less likely — merging.The last time two storms made landfall in the United States within 24 hours of each other was in 1933, Klotzbach said.It seems fitting for 2020 to have this type of twin threats, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.“Of course, we have to have two simultaneously land-falling hurricanes,” McNoldy said. “It’s best not to ask what’s next.”On Friday morning, a hurricane-hunting airplane found Laura's center to be dozens of miles farther south and better formed than satellite images showed. That triggered a shift in the forecast track, putting Caribbean islands more at risk and an upgrade to tropical storm status.If Laura goes over land, Puerto Rico and the mountains of Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Cuba could tear it apart and not make it much of a threat to the mainland United States, meteorologists said. But if it misses or skirts land, it could head into warm waters conducive to strengthening as it approaches Florida, meteorologists said.With competing scenarios, the hurricane center is forecasting a middle range for Laura of a weak hurricane heading into the eastern Gulf of Mexico.Officials in the Florida Keys, which Laura might pass over on its route into the Gulf, declared a local state of emergency Friday and issued a mandatory evacuation order for anyone living on boats, in mobile homes and in campers. Tourists staying in hotels should be aware of hazardous weather conditions and consider altering their plans starting on Sunday, Monroe County officials said in a news release.Citing both storm systems, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Friday night. “It is too soon to know exactly where, when or how these dual storms will affect Louisiana, but now is the time for our people to prepare for these storms,” Edwards said in a statement.Meteorologists said Tropical Depression 14 has a better chance of surviving its early land encounter, then strengthening to a minimal hurricane over warm water, but the hurricane center was forecasting it to weaken before it reaches the U.S. Gulf Coast because of decapitating high winds.___Associated Press reporter Freida Frisaro in Miami contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

“There was a clinic in Gering that was on the list,” he said. “I thought it would be great because Jamalee could spend more time with her family.”
 Dan spent two months with the Gentry Clinic in Gering and became very familiar with what was then called West Nebraska General Hospital.
 “Scottsbluff was so fortunate to be a small town and still have a big city hospital at that time,” he said. “It was a combination I really liked.”
 After Dan finished his training, the physicians at the Gentry Clinic invited him to join the practice in 1971. That turned into 42 years of full-time practice and five more years as a part-timer.
 Dan said that as a small town general practitioner, he had the privilege to treat three generations of the same family.
 Outside of medicine, the primary activity where Dan was involved pointed back to his minor in music.
 “I became interested in barbershop harmony and discovered an entire worldwide society of people who also love it,” he said. “So 42 years ago, I joined what would eventually become the Barbershop Harmony Society.”
 As a member, Dan formed a men’s chorus with Jerry Tallmon, Bill Tallmon and Gary Drown. Named the Sugar Valley Singers, Jerry directed the chorus for its first nine years until he stepped down. The group’s next director was Dan Clark.
 “We’re still alive although we don’t have a lot of singers,” he said. “Unfortunately we’ve been unable to get together since March when the pandemic broke out.”
 Dan’s son and daughter have both taken an interest in music and singing barbershop. His son directs a chorus in Colorado Springs and his son-in-law spent 15 years directing a big chorus in Denver.
 “In the past few years, more and more women have become interested in joining some of the men’s choruses, especially if a women’s chorus hadn’t been organized in their area,” Dan said. “We’ve opened our doors to a couple of women who wanted to sing. Women have also been invited to be a part of the Barbershop Harmony Society.”
 While this year is “on hold” for the Old Settlers group during Oregon Trail Days, the plan is for them to gather again in 2021 with Dan Clark as their Honorary President.
 As Dan and Jamalee’s kids were growing up, they always took part of the Kiddie Parade, so the annual Oregon Trail Days celebration is a great event.
 “I hope this virus bump in the road doesn’t bother the event in the long term,” Dan said. “I don’t think it will and we’ll bounce back strongly.”

With the end of August drawing near, we got all geared up this week for our favorite fall tradition. Linemen shooting the gap and the halfback option pass. And we weren't alone. Indeed, we could already hear the roar of the crowd under the Friday night lights as the high school gridiron season was … abruptly postponed until spring. Bummerewski, right? Not if you're a football coach.
   
 Then you just say something profound about life lessons and character- building.
   
 Coaching, you see, has nothing to do with X's and O's. It's all about using tired cliches. Like giving 110%. Leaving everything on the field. And having a great attitude. Even when the opponent only has two players -- neither of whom has ever seen a football, much less knows what to do with it -- every coach always says the same thing.
   
 "They're a good football team."
   
 They have to say that word, too. Football. Shows how smart they are. Besides, they're right. That two-player squad's going to score the game's first 90 points. Before getting off the bus. 'Cuz they're a good football team.
   
 And that's why we never played the game. We had a lousy attitude. You would, too, if you were constantly getting knocked down and trampled on. Or suffering through two-a-days in sweltering heat and humidity. The kind that's melted Greenland's ice cap past the point of no return and sent the mercury soaring to 130 in Death Valley.
   
 Perhaps that's why everyone's in such a rotten mood these days. It's hot. You can't go anywhere. Can't do anything. Even the pizza joints are going bust, thanks to the nationwide pepperoni shortage. You'd drown your sorrows at the local watering holes, but they're closed, too.
   
 Fortunately, the worm has turned. A major economic boom is now brewing. One that will save the dairy industry, boost sales for food retailers, and restore restaurants to profitability. All because of an upgraded version of a favorite frozen concoction guaranteed to both take you to your happy place and make you forget all your troubles.
   
 Booze-infused ice cream.
   
 Laugh all you want, but New York has just legalized the stuff, certain it will be a boon to tourism and banking on it proving so popular with consumers that everyone 21 and over will … ahem … just eat it up. Since our idea of adult beverage starts and ends at moo juice -- straight, no chaser -- the notion of getting stoned on Rocky Road leaves us cold. But human nature being what it is, we're pretty sure other states will be falling all over themselves to follow the Empire State's lead.
   
 In a New York minute.
   
 Indeed, Michigan's probably leading the way. With the state having given downtown drinking districts the green light, enterprising ice cream parlors are at this very moment melting down half-gallon containers of the new bourbon-flavored Stagger Lee line of product for tipsy patrons to sip from sealed containers while lurching from store to store.
   
 It's also a move that country music stars -- desperate to revive their flagging careers -- are sure to welcome as they scurry back to the recording studios to reissue new twists on their old standards. Like Dierks Bentley's "Drunk on a Cone," David Lee Murphy's "Dust on the Sundae," and Garth Brooks' "Two Scoops of Spiked Haagen-Dazs."
   
 One for each hand.
   
 Welcome to the new normal. Where it's last call at 2 a.m. at the local popsicle stand. And the first thing a cop says after pulling over a weaving motorist is, "Sir. Have you been eating ice cream tonight?"
   
 It's a strange, strange world we live in, Master Jack.

I am not a big reader. That may sound ironic since I write a newspaper column, but sometimes I struggle to read my own 600-800 words each week. Nonetheless, during this time of COVID, like many of you, I have turned to books to fill some time.
 Although I may not love to read, I do have a few favorite books and it has been nice to pick them up again and review their contents. A good reminder of the steps to happiness that we can all pursue.
 One of the most impressive (and thankfully short) books I’ve ever read is by Spencer Johnson, titled “Peaks and Valleys.” In this short 100-page story he tells of the ups and the downs of life.
 None of us are exempt from this fluctuation as we travel the road of our mortal existence. Even if we try our hardest, we all hit hard times. Perhaps it’s the passing of a parent or a financially difficult time. Raising teenagers or moving far away from those we love. Come what may, sooner or later life offers a few bumps and potholes for us all.
 This is clearly applicable to relationships, too. Each and every couple will have ups and downs. Research continues to show that even the happiest couples still have their valleys. But happy couples respond to valleys differently than unhappy couples, and that’s what makes the difference. .
 First, they learn to see a valley as a learning experience; an opportunity to discover what’s not working. Then, by taking action on what they’ve learned, they turn their valley into a peak.
 Let’s say, for example, that Bob and Mary are not happy in their relationship; they’ve realized they’re in a valley. Instead of being bitter and angry toward each other, and doing nothing about the situation, they see this as a chance to find out what’s not working.

MelroseWakefield Hospital: Experienced cardiac doctors close to home

The Spring Hill Panthers displayed a physical running game and a potentially lethal passing game on offense to go along with a few surprises on the defensive side of the ball Thursday during a scrimmage on the road against Mount Vernon.
 It took a little while, but rookie head coach Weston Griffis was actually able to enjoy the show put on by his team at Don Meredith Stadium.
 “I’m not going to lie. I found myself watching the offensive line and trying to coach them early on,” said Griffis, who has an extensive background as an offensive line coach an was the team’s offensive coordinator last year before taking over as head coach for the 2020 campaign.
 “I told one of my coaches I didn’t even know what to do with my hands. It was a different feeling, especially when we got to the live quarter. But, I enjoyed it. I remember at one point looking around and thinking ‘Wow. I have a great coaching staff, and they are coaching their tails off.’ They sure make my job easy.”
 Spring Hill and Mount Vernon ran a total of 56 plays with the first and second teams, and then competed in a live quarter. All of Spring Hill’s scoring came in the controlled portion of the scrimmage, but the Panthers did have the ball on the Tiger 1-yard line when time expired in the live quarter that ended in a 0-0 tie.
 “I was impressed with how physical our kids were,” Griffis said. “It’s how we’ve been practicing, and it carried over to the scrimmage. I was also impressed with our returning guys. The leaders did what they were supposed to do, but I was also impressed with a lot of our young guys stepping up.”
 The offensive scored four times in the controlled portion of the scrimmage, and Eric Morrow has a hand in all of the touchdowns. Morrow hauled in touchdown passes of 70 yards from Brennan Ferguson and 80 yards from Jax Stovall to go along with a 70-yard TD run.
 Griffis also mentioned fullback Brody Barnhill and tailbacks Devaunte Powers and Michael Marrs as standouts on offense working behind a veteran offensive line.
 Stovall threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Grayson Crews — a junior who caught Griffis’ eye on the defensive slde.
 “Grayson Crews has grown a lot over the last year, and he played well,” Griffis said. “Dominique Alexander at cornerback also had a good showing. He’s a physical new guy at that position.”
 The Panthers now turn their attention to Friday’s season opener at home against the Sabine Cardinals.
 Spring Hill finished 6-6 a year ago, earning the program’s first playoff berth in 12 years and knocking off Caddo Mills (23-12) for the team’s first postseason victory in 15 seasons. The season ended with a 54-14 bi-district loss to Waco Connally.
 Sabine carved out a 10-2 record a year ago, the first 10-win season in program history, and defeated Mount Vernon (20-14) for the Cardinals’ first playoff win in school history. Sabine fell to Pottsboro, 47-35, in the bi-district round.

Dear Abby: Man's affair with neighbor reaches moment of truth

NEW LONDON — West Rusk’s Nick Harrison and White Oak’s Kris Iske left with favorable impressions from Thursday evening’s controlled scrimmage at Bruce Bradshaw Stadium.
 Not even stifling 90-plus degree temperatures could cool the excitement of a return to football in East Texas. This would be the lone dress rehearsal for each school as the 2020 regular season kicks off next week.
 “The big thing we wanted to see more than anything else was attitude and effort,” said Harrison in his second year in charge with the Raiders. “We had questions going in on our physicality. I felt overall we were physical in the areas we needed to be. Not perfect, but working toward getting better each week.”
 “I was very pleased with our kids and thought we performed well. Of course we had a few mistakes here and there. But just coming out against a good West Rusk team I thought we did really well,” said Iske in seventh-year with the Roughnecks.
 Each team was allotted 35 plays during the controlled portion and closed by playing two live 15-minute quarters. The Raiders managed three scores in the controlled segment and added a touchdown during live action.
 “When you’re young like we are, it’s important to show you’re not timid. It’s not so much being young as it’s inexperience,” Harrison explained. “We want to get them as many reps as possible and see them cut loose and play free.”
 Sophomore quarterback Andon Mata perked up the home crowd when he connected with freshman Ty Harper on a 60-yard slant route when the Raiders faced a third and 16. West Rusk’s second score came with the twos when sophomore James Greenalch rumbled 53-yards to the house on a second and short.
 Junior signal-caller Peyton Lyons got in on the act for the Raiders with a 75-yard pitch-and-catch to fleet-footed Geremiah Smith as the controlled portion of play came to a close.
 The only score during live action came when sophomore Tate Winings went 22 yards up the gut to complete a 5-play, 62-yard drive that used 3:01 of the play clock.
 “It was great to see our young guys relax and just start being playmakers. This was a good opportunity to have our kids show what they’re made of. That’s what we’re looking for going into week one,” Harrison said.
 The Roughnecks are busy breaking into a couple new quarterbacks of their own. Juniors Cayson Siegley and Dylan Creager took turns running the offense.
 “Neither one of those guys have ever been a quarterback. I thought they played pretty well against a good West Rusk defense. Siegley moved around good in the pocket and made some good throws,” Iske said. “Being it was the first time going up against competition other than ourselves, I thought they handled things real well.”
 Senior tailback Jackson Frazier had several good runs for the Roughnecks including a 15-yard dash to open the scrimmage. Siegley connected on a 24-yard pass to Colton Cobb that would be nullified by a White Oak holding call.
 Creager, who paired with sophomore Noah Carter in the controlled session, went 12 yards on a keeper that carried to the West Rusk 34.
 White Oak’s best bid in the live portion came when Siegley converted a third down on a well-timed slant to Carter to push the ball across midfield.
 “I think we improved and we’re just going to get better every single week. The more experience we get the better we’ll be,” said Iske.
 West Rusk opens Friday against East Chambers in a neutral site game at Lufkin’s Abe Martin Stadium, while White Oak will kick off the 2020 season at home to Harleton.

Oregon's state-level efforts to aid those unemployed citizens affected by the coronavirus pandemic officially ran out on Friday. According to _Fox 12 Oregon_, the Oregon House speaker and Senate president confirmed that the 70,000 payments made available on Wednesday had been "distributed or dedicated."
 The effort comes as federal lawmakers continue to disagree over a second stimulus package, and questions remain over Donald Trump's executive orders claiming up to $400 in unemployment relief to those already claiming. With unemployment claims climbing again this week, Oregon's situation shows how there could be other solutions. It also shows that there is a clear need for aid across the board.
 "Financial institutions who are participating in this unique public-private partnership will have a final funding allotment cap for the day and will not be accepting new walk-in applications once they reach the allotment cap. Previously scheduled appointments will continue through the end of the month, but new appointments will not be made," a statement from the state lawmakers' offices read.
 The program was approved in mid-July, setting aside $35 million for $500 check payments to people who applied. _Fox 12_ notes that there were long lines across the state at credit unions and banks ahead of Friday's news. The outlet also spoke to one man who claimed he filed unemployment months prior and still hadn't received a payment.
 "It's crazy man, I've been here for what feels like 2 hours now, but it's worth it," Jesse Coy told Fox 12. "I've got nothing else to do … I'm out of work right now. I haven't had a job here in a couple months, and it's been tough."
 Eligibility for the one-time payment in Oregon required those applying to be 18-years-old, residents of the state, prove they faced hardship from the pandemic and had a pre-tax monthly income under $4,000. Oregon House Speaker Tina Kotek spoke out about the program and the need for federal help.
 0comments
 "These last couple days have put a spotlight on just how dire the need is all across the state," Kotek said. "We have to get more money to help people. The federal government has the ability to make direct stimulus payments to Americans whose lives are in jeopardy and are not doing so. I find this incredibly frustrating and disappointing."
 As it stands, stimulus negotiations in D.C. are at a standstill. While lawmakers have been called back to vote on emergency funding for the U.S. Postal Service, any talk on stimulus is still up in the air.

But it appears that the worst US dislocations from the global economy started ebbing about a decade ago. Going forward, US workers will likely face a much greater threat from technology. COVID, of course, will only accelerate the shift to automate more jobs amid a prolonged economic slowdown. With private- sector labor unions having largely collapsed, workers just keep losing ground, both relative to their employers and in having their concerns represented in our legislative politics (where unions used to play a big role). And in term of your question’s second part, about how elites themselves should respond: we largely focus in this book on building and maintaining effective coalitions in the legislative process. We place a lot of emphasis on business leaders recognizing the need for policies that will improve workers’ lives and strengthen their communities — essential aspects of fending off populism in the US today, both from left and right.

Studies on rivers streaming over the skies are recently drawing attention in the science community. As water vapor that was evaporated from land and the ocean reassemble in the atmosphere to take the form of a long belt, it is called an “Atmospheric River.” Some of Atmospheric Rivers contain vapor more than twice the amount in the Amazon River, the longest river on the globe. While three to five of Atmospheric Rivers float over the skies, they send vapor to the Earth. More than 90 percent of vapor formed in subtropical regions move to drier and colder regions of higher latitude through Atmospheric Rivers. Sometimes, Atmospheric Rivers are a cause for torrential rain and floods. According to studies by the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences, 35 percent of summertime precipitation in southern regions of South Korea is related to Atmospheric Rivers.      In the ocean, an amount of water large enough to lower the sea level by one meter evaporates and goes up to the skies every year, and turns into the same amount of precipitation through rain or snow, before falling onto the land surface to maintain the sea level constantly and stably. When temperatures rise, the amount of vapor also increases in tandem, and thus the amount of precipitation mounts proportionately. Every time the temperature rises by one degree Celsius, the amount of vapor in the atmosphere increases by 7 percent. A warmer Earth, which gets hotter due to constantly accelerating global warming, supplies a huge volume of vapor to Atmospheric Rivers, and people live amid a constant risk of embracing the massive amount of water that could fall as torrential rain or snow anytime, completely unpredictably. The problem is that such Atmospheric Rivers can appear in the form of extreme weather such as torrential rain and flood to threaten us. If they are combined with a typhoon or monsoon, they could inflict tremendous damage.      Typhoons are created through vapor released by seawater that gets hotter during the summer, and are increasingly gaining strength due to global warming in recent years. With record-high earth temperatures since April and higher seawater temperatures in the regions hit by typhoons, the energy that has been built could gradually develop into an extraordinarily powerful typhoon.      The more moisture is formed in Atmospheric Rivers that stream through the skies, the bugger vessel is needed to contain such water on land. The government should repair those regions with rivers and streams that suffered heavy rainfall damage, which is “common sense” response.

Sanjay Dutt's old friend Jackie Shroff says actor will shine through cancer battle
 Sanjay Dutt was diagnosed with lung cancer last week and as the actor continues to seek preliminary treatment in Mumbai, industry friends have started to pour their love on him.
 Recently, Sanjay's old friend, actor Jackie Shroff came forth reacting to the news of his cancer battle.
 Responding to if he has reached out to his pal, Jackie said, "I sent him a text message."
 "Sanju baba is like a phoenix. He has been through a lot of problems in his life and I am sure he is going to rise and shine through this too," he added.
 Jackie and Sanjay have shared screen space in films like _Mission Kashmir, Kartoos, Eklavya_ and _Khalnayak_ to name a few.
 Sanjay Dutt's wife Maanayata recently gave an update about his health from a private Mumbai hospital.
 In a long post Maanayata wrote, "Sanju has been through many ups and downs in his life, but what has kept him going through every tough phase has always been your adulation and support. And for this, we will always be grateful. We are now being tested through yet another challenge, and I know, the same love and warmth will see him through this time as well."
 "In these trying times, unfortunately, I have been unable to be by his side in the hospital, due to my home quarantine which ends in a couple of days. Every battle has a torchbearer and someone who holds the fort. Priya who has worked extensively over two decades with our family-run Cancer foundation, and who has also seen her mother battle this illness, has been our incredible torchbearer, while I will hold the fort."
 "For those asking, Sanju will complete his preliminary treatment in Mumbai. We will formulate further plans of travel depending on how and when the covid situation eases. As of now, Sanju is in the best hands of our esteemed doctors at Kokilaben hospital," she added.

John Legend, Chrissy Teigen selling luxe mansion for $24 million ahead of baby's arrival
 John Legend and Chrissy Teigen's luxe Beverly Hills mansion is now up for grabs.
 The couple has decided to sell their house for a whopping $24 million, as they gear up to welcome another member in their family.
 Legend and Teigen bought the sprawling 8,500-square-foot property for $14.1 million in 2016 from Rihanna.
 According to reports, they had plans to stay there indefinitely.
 However they recently found out that Teigen is expecting and that they will need a bigger residence.
 The couple, are already parents to 4-year-old daughter Luna and 2-year-old son Miles.
 Moreover, the newly-renovated house will simply not be able to adjust the family of five, as well as Teigen’s mother, Vilailuck, who lives with them.
 About the said renovations, Legend had revealed, “We like modern with still some edge to it and some warmth and some coziness,” the singer said of changing up the bright white elements and glassy finishes they inherited at the time of purchase.
 To do that, designer Don Stewart suggested teak wood detailing and a hand- carved ceiling. “It was something we would never have thought to do ourselves, but Chrissy’s mother is from Southeast Asia, so we try to find ways to work her heritage into our houses,” Legend said.
 "We like the kitchen to be part of life, so it’s not cordoned off from the rest of the house,” said Legend. The result was a kitchen with three ovens and two stovetops along with an indoor and outdoor grill," he concluded.

 "There is no use heading home if the baby is born when he is in the air.
 "We don't have a best-case scenario at this point (for Sidebottom's return to the team).
 "The best-case scenario is, first and foremost, that everyone is happy and healthy and that Steele and his young family are committed to each other as long as they need.
 "The rest will fall into place."
 Sidebottom missed four matches through suspension after breaking AFL COVID-19 protocols in late June but has shone for the injury-hit Magpies since his return in round nine - averaging 23.5 disposals across four appearances.
 His partner is reportedly due to give birth days before the final round of the home-and-away season.
 COVID-19 protocols agreed by the AFL with the Queensland dictate club figures from interstate must quarantine for 14 days before joining club hubs and playing matches.
 Meanwhile, Buckley confirmed Brody Mihocek will miss Monday night's match at the Gabba after he was unable to pass a concussion test five days out.
 Ben Reid had already been ruled out with a hamstring injury, possibly opening the door for key forward Mason Cox to return.
 Jaidyn Stephenson will return from a calf complaint and key defender Jordan Roughead is available after being cleared of concussion.
 Buckley said Jordan De Goey had stepped up his training program and could return to action before the finals, but still needs time to allow his injured finger to heal.
 "He is hungry to go, he wants to go. He is a bit of a caged animal in that sense," Buckley said.
 "He can do anything other than handle the footy in a contested situation at the moment."

Under a graduated-rate income tax, different levels of wages are taxed at different rates. Proponents say higher income taxpayers should bear a greater tax burden than lower income taxpayers. Opponents say a graduated tax hurts business owners and job creators and makes them the target of future tax hikes. Raising taxes across the board under a flat tax is more difficult to do, they say.

Jerald "Jerry" D. Cerra, 71, of Wilton, Maine, died unexpectedly Friday, Aug. 14, of natural causes.   He was born in Stockton, California, on Oct. 6, 1948, the only child of Donald and Jacqueline Cerra. At the age of 6 he and his parents moved to Anchorage before Alaska had even become a state. Jerry and his parents were living in a cabin in Anchorage during the 1964 Good Friday earthquake. He graduated from West Anchorage High School in 1966. In October 1966 he enlisted in the U.S. Navy where he proudly served for seven years. He was happiest during the years he spent at sea.   After his honorable discharge from the Navy he returned to Alaska where he worked for the National Weather Service, residing in Bethel, Nome, and then Fairbanks as an electronic technician. Next, he worked as an airway transportation system specialist for the Federal Aviation Administration in Fairbanks, retiring in 2004.   On Dec. 6, 1993, he married his wife, Irene Howe. He thoroughly enjoyed their time spent fishing and boating on the beautiful waters of Prince William Sound. In 2004 he purchased his retirement boat in Bellingham, Washington, and he and his wife took an adventure of a lifetime and motored it up the inside passage from Bellingham to Valdez. He also enjoyed riding his Harley Davidson motorcycles and Trike.   In October 2012 he moved from his beloved Alaska to their retirement home in Sequim, Washington, with the family cat, Needles. His wife joined him after retiring a few months later. In March 2018, the family moved to Wilton, Maine, to be closer to Irene's family.   Jerry enjoyed traveling; trips included Hawaii, Las Vegas, Reno, Mexico, Aruba and Puerto Rico. He also liked playing slots, darts, camping and snowmobiling.   He was a former member of the American Legion and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. He was known for his dry wit and for being very meticulous.   He is survived and missed by his wife, Irene, of Wilton; his father in-law, Edwin Howe, of Bryant Pond; brother and sister-in-law Wayne and Marilyn Howe, of Bryant Pond; nephew Christopher Howe, and his fiance, Tonia, of Auburn; niece Bethany Emerson, her husband, Fred, and children Laurel and Grant, of Gorham; and nephew Jared Howe of Bethel; and their two special kitties Shadow and Mittens.   He was predeceased by his parents and his mother in-law, Elouise Howe.   Jerry requested no services, but please enjoy a favorite beverage in his memory. If desired, donations can be made to your favorite animal rescue group. Memories and photos may be shared in his Book of Memories at www.wilesrc.com.

During the pandemic the national media focused on the hot spots, while your local media’s attention was close to home. However, today your local media outlets are struggling to keep their doors open and keep local reporters on the payroll.
 There is a bipartisan bill in Congress that will provide much needed help for local media outlets. The Local Journalism Sustainability Act – HR 7640 introduced by Reps. Dan Newhouse (R-WA) and Ann Kirkpatrick (D-AZ) will help.
 This is not a bailout, but it is a way to encourage Americans to subscribe to their local newspapers, help local businesses offset the cost of advertising and encourage local newspapers to invest in young journalists all through tax credits.
 The bill offers a series of three tax credits aimed at providing a pathway for local journalism viability. The first credit works to encourage annual subscriptions to your local newspaper (dailies and weeklies). The second is a five-year refundable credit for local newspapers to employ and adequately compensate journalists. The last is a five-year nonrefundable tax credit for small-to-medium sized businesses to advertise with local newspapers, local radio and local television stations.
 For struggling businesses this bill offers a way to offset the cost of getting the word out and drawing in needed customers. For readers it is a way to offset the cost of a subscription which will help you stay informed and increase your knowledge of the community you call home.
 “Local journalists and newspapers are essential to ensuring the public remains informed,” Rep. Newhouse said. “Local news is crucial, particularly within our rural communities.”
 The newspaper I got my start at now has one staff member who is the editor, reporter and photographer. They also work for a second weekly 45 miles from the first.
 Here in Nebraska it is vitally important for Third District Congressman Adrian Smith to become a co-signer and help get HR 7640 passed. When it gets into the Senate it will be Senator Deb Fischer and Senator Ben Sasse’s turn to show their support for rural America and pass HR 7640. This bill will not only help the Star-Herald, but also our local radio and television stations, weekly newspapers across the Panhandle, readers and local businesses.
 Without HR 7640 I don’t know if today a young photographer, such as I was, would get the chance I got. The Local Journalism Sustainability Act is a win for local journalists, a win for local businesses and a win for readers.

"articleBody" : "A policewoman helped a pregnant woman give birth at a checkpoint in the southern province of Adana on Aug. 20 as she couldn’t make it to the hospital due to intense labor pains. Husne Aslan, the pregnant woman and a mother of four children, was on the way to hospital with her husband on Aug. 20. However, due to the increasing labor pains, the husband had to stop the car at the nearest checkpoint to seek help, where Demet Çubukçu, a policewoman, was on duty. Çubukçu immediately called an ambulance, but after seeing the mother on the verge of giving birth, she rushed to help in delivering the baby until the medics came and took both to the hospital. “I called the ambulance, but it was too late as the woman looked like she could give birth anytime. You know I am a police officer and am not trained for this. I was shocked. But I followed my instincts,” said the policewoman. “We just showed that the Turkish police is always with the public,” added Çubukçu. After she got discharged from the hospital a day later, Aslan went to the same checkpoint with her baby girl to meet Çubukçu. Aslan told Çubukçu she named the newborn after her, Demet. “This is a surprise for me. When I held the baby girl for the first time, I was scared because she was not crying. When I slapped her bottom and heard her first cry, it made me so proud. I am so happy to learn that she has bene named Demet,” Çubukçu said. Officer praised by police department, public The police officer was awarded a certificate of achievement by the police chief of the province, Doğan İnci, who said, “Our officers work 24/7 for the service of citizens. This incident is the perfect example.” “I saw the woman in agony and as both a woman and a police myself, I came forward to help her,” said Çubukçu in the award ceremony while thanking her chief. The policewoman became a national hero after the incident drew public attention. Speaking to a TV channel, Çubukçu, a mother of two children, said, “It was a matter of life. This is the first time I do such a thing. But I must say, I would do the same if I encountered something similar again.” “As a police officer, I have to do what I have to do.” Çubukçu’s daughter also expressed her happiness and pride. “I am proud of my mother,” said Aybuke, the daughter of the policewoman.",

Amy Seimetz’s _She Dies Tomorrow_ has been called the first COVID film. Obviously, it was made before the pandemic. But one of the virus’ achievements has been to accelerate and accentuate our pre-existing realities, so of course, this film was also made in and in response to the world we’re currently suffering. Though it strives to summon some shared existential reality and to touch a collective nerve on edge, _She Dies_ is a personal film, made inside a special corner of America, the manifestation of a specific kind of anxiety. Seimetz has said that her film was partly inspired by how weird it felt to buy a house, and by her occasionally arresting fears of attacks and home invasions. The film’s characters are likewise LA homeowners, young creatives and attractive couples who host dinner parties and one by one reel and stagger at the prospect that their life — _that_ life — is over.

New cases of COVID-19 in Australia’s Victoria state continued to decline Saturday with 182 new infections, along with 13 deaths. It was the second day in a row in which the number of new infections has fallen below 200. Only 24 of the latest cases are without a known source, a contrast to the start of August when hundreds could not be traced. Australia’s second largest city, Melbourne, and parts of rural Victoria were placed in full lockdown in early August. It's due to continue until Sept. 13. “Whilst tomorrow’s numbers will be for tomorrow, we are all pleased to see a ‘one’ in front of these additional case numbers, and to a certain extent, it is perhaps at that level a little quicker than I thought it might be,” Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said. Meanwhile, an outbreak linked to a youth detention center in Queensland state has caused the state’s premier to reintroduce restrictions on public gatherings. The cluster connected to the Brisbane Youth Detention Center now stands at seven, including six confirmed on Saturday. The 127 inmates, some as young as 13, have been locked in their rooms since a 77-year-old female supervisor tested positive on Wednesday. The worker, who is now in a hospital, worked five shifts at the center while infectious. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told a news conference Saturday the cases are of concern because “people have been out and about in the community.”
