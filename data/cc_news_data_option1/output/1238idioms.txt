 In fact, writing is just one of the many ways people are expressing themselves now they have more time on their hands and are forbidden to travel.
 Whether it’s fashioning a macramé hanging, making crop circle artwork on the lawn, practising a new language or helping the kids with painting those ubiquitous rainbows, it’s anything goes.
 Parents have now become home-schoolers and some have thrown themselves into it with all the flair of a contestant on a reality TV show. They are even using props.

“Sanford tested them curbside in Vermillion so they didn’t enter our physical structure, which we’re very thankful for. It is a mild case, it appears, and someone who can shelter at home,” he said. “The Department of Health, I believe, does all of the follow-up in terms of community exposure to see who they’ve been in contact with and when and if they’ve traveled.”
 Tracy said the Clay County COVID-19 case appears to be travel-related.
 “It’s not one of community spread. That’s good news. We’ve been asked several times what Sanford Vermillion is doing and we’ve been a little ahead of the game down here in terms of our response because we have an extraordinary group of long-term, post-acute care people in our building in the nursing home and Dakota Gardens,” he said.
 No visitors have been allowed in the Sanford Vermillion facilities for over two weeks, Tracy said. Staff members are screened and have their temperatures taken before they enter the building.
 He applauds the local health care provider’s staff for the way they are handling local COVID-19 testing.
 “Full, personal protective equipment was used as designed in keeping with the process so there was no risk of exposure to our employees because of that,” Tracy said. “I’m very happy with Sanford Health in the turnaround time in this testing. With this case, it was less than 24 hours.”
 Sanford Vermillion is the only place in Clay County where one can go to be tested for COVID-19. Community members who suspect they may be ill with the virus should call Sanford Vermillion Medical Center at 605-677-3700 instead of visiting the clinic.

State public health officials knew about the exposure on Monday, and other officials were informed on Tuesday, as employees began to be tested with the explanation that they had been exposed to a known positive person. We were then able to tell employees more about how and when they were exposed, and we were finally able to report the exposure in story form online on Wednesday and in print on Thursday.


  And our managing editor has made many public and candid statements online over the last three days about his personal experience being exposed and in quarantine.


  Could we have been faster? Certainly. However, we needed to get it right.


  We will continue to face significant challenges coming out of this crisis. Our business has suffered greatly, even before this week, and we’ve been faced with many difficult decisions in the last few days, including impacting the future of our workforce. We know that other small businesses in this community are facing similar situations. It’s a scary time.


  At the end of the day, this is a crisis that is going to dominate our lives for the weeks and months to come. This is a virus that attacks our bodies, but it does not attack our empathy for our fellow residents. It does not attack our faith in our community. It certainly does not attack the commitment, resilience and persistence of our employees.

Kyle Krustangel is taking a lemons-into-lemonade approach to the coronavirus outbreak that’s ravaging the sports calendar.
 The fifth-year Yakima Valley College baseball coach who’ll take the reins of the Yakima Valley Pippins this summer has something that’s usually scarce in the spring and summer — free time.
 “It’s been nice to put the husband hat back on,” said Krustangel, whose wife, Katie, is a middle school teacher and had her own schedule jolted by the COVID-19 outbreak.
 The couple and a 1-year-old Labradoodle have been hanging around their Selah home getting done what work they can.
 “I’m probably driving them crazy but it’s refreshing to have this family time,” he said.
 Krustangel said he felt Yakima Valley’s season could be in peril as leagues shut down one after another. After first suspending action, the NWAC canceled spring sports March 17 with the Yaks in the middle of a 17-game homestand.
 “It’s obviously a tough situation,” he said. “You kind of felt like you were up against time.”
 Krustangel and his coaching staff quickly had exit interviews with their players, sending them back home with homework.
 “I miss the guys more than anything. It was tough to tell 38 guys in one-on- one meetings (that the season was over),” he said. “We gave all our players individualized plans, some of these guys never have a break to work on individual skills.”
 The Pippins, who have about three dozen players lined up to play for them this summer, are scheduled to begin June 5 by hosting defending champion Corvallis. The league is monitoring the outbreak, but plans to open on time.
 Krustangel is in regular contact with incoming players and their coaches,
 “We try to get the right guys, maybe not the most talented,” he said, “but the guys who want to work and want to get better. We talk to coaches and make sure every one is on board.”

Kriste Kidd, owner of Oasis Senior Advisors, was taking a client and her family through a tour of an assisted living community when she saw the staff begin to turn away family members who were coming to visit.


  The State of Maryland had just ordered all nursing homes to bar any visitors from entering due to the spread of the novel coronavirus. The family members were visibly upset, and Kidd could understand why.


  “I had clients one by one reach out to me, saying I can’t visit my mom, I can’t visit my dad, this is heartbreaking,” Kidd said. “From there, I became emotional about it, and put myself in the shoes of the seniors who couldn’t see their loved ones.”


  Kidd wanted to do something to help the countless seniors who were now in isolation. She worked closely with many of them through Oasis Senior Advisors, which helps match seniors and nursing homes, assisted living communities and retirement homes.


  Although people couldn’t go inside, she figured she would send well wishes through cards filled out by members of the community.


  While others were clearing stores of their toilet paper stock, Kidd was going through dollar stores to buy all the blank cards that they had. She said she has so far cleared about five stores of their stock.


  She then got in touch with some people she knew could help distribute the cards, such as her old high school friend Hilari Varnadore. Varnadore leads a Girl Scout Troop at Middletown High School and wanted to distribute the cards to the girls.


  But with social distancing in place and school canceled, Varnadore’s daughter Bree, 14, ended up filling out most of the cards herself, along with her brother Kit, 10.


  Varnadore said that it was great for the kids to have a project to work on, and that drawing on the cards and writing messages was therapeutic. Both of her children are in their last years at their schools – Kit will be moving up to middle school and Bree will be moving up high school next year.


  “I think missing the end of the year is a little more stressful on them than they realize,” Varnadore said.


  The children also lost their grandparents who lived nearby within the last few years.


  “I think just doing something nice for older people was something that made them feel good, too,” Varnadore said.


  Kidd also shared her idea to Facebook, where it took off, garnering over 170 volunteers. So far, Kidd has donated 1,500 cards and has another 2,100 being filled out by volunteers.


  “It’s just been a very touching, uplifting community effort to do something positive during this time that is not so positive,” Kidd said.


  Kidd currently has volunteers pick up the cards, fill them out, and drop them off on her porch. She will then put the cards in bags for the nursing homes and keep them in her house for 72 hours in order for any virus that might be on the cards to die.


  While she has received some comments on Facebook saying that sending any card into a nursing home could be dangerous, she knows that the homes’ staff can also choose to hold the cards longer if they feel it is necessary.


  “But I also say, ‘Are you still receiving mail,’ because these seniors in the community are still receiving mail from their loved ones,” Kidd said. “Some of them that cannot use technology, their only form of communication is old fashioned letters.”


  The volunteers range from 3-year-olds drawing pictures on the insides of the cards to other seniors who want to write letters to those in isolation.


  Kidd is hoping on expanding the project soon to write cards to doctors and other health care workers.


  “They don’t have the luxury of working from home, and their sacrifice hasn’t gone unnoticed. And volunteers are willing to start that project as well,” Kidd said.


  Readers who are interested in volunteering to help make cards for seniors can contact Kriste Kidd at kkidd@youroasisadvisor.com.

It would have been tempting to explore the rain forests looking for exotic plants to sell at the weekly auction, but there were dangers. Native Indians roamed the hillsides and weren’t too happy with Westerners taking their plants. “Only last week, we heard that Mr. White of Winchmore Hill perished in the search for Dendrobium phalaenopsis.”
 In one unusual case, rare orchids were observed growing among the bones of an Indian graveyard in New Guinea. The explorer had to bribe the natives and, after a lengthy trip at sea, thousands of plants arrived in London. One variety was auctioned off still attached to a skull.
 Springtime sales were the most heavily attended since the growing season was just beginning. Britain had six or seven months of sunlight and warm weather ahead so that the plants could “recover from the effects of a long voyage and uncomfortable quarters.”
 Orchid survival rates were greatly improved if the plants could get settled in and rooted before winter.
 Today, of course, collectors have the luxury of buying their plants at nurseries, floral shops and over the internet. Yet, it is fascinating to learn what the early days of orchid raising were like and it gives hobbyists a greater appreciation for these time-tested epiphytes. First-hand accounts like Frederick Boyle’s make all of this possible.

  The sudden, COVID-19-related change is also hitting the husband and father of two in his pockets.


  "The way we used to make money for so many years, now it's completely opposite. Fortunately, our company president and our manager, they are sacrificing a lot for us," said Malique.


  Their bosses are also telling the taxi drivers to clean their cabs routinely.


  "We are getting lots of disinfectants, napkins, sanitizers and Lysol. I have it all sitting up front next to me. Where ever people are going to be touching, handles, doors, seats, we must constantly wipe it down," said the concerned cabbie.


  It's a new safety precaution about 200 area cab drivers are now practicing.


  "It's pretty bad overall for them financially. I'm not gonna say they're not suffering because they are. Their business is way down. Half of the fleet of airport taxis has been cut down by one third. Their fears are that we will have some drivers come down with the illness by trying to do the right thing. The good thing about it is not everybody's abandoned ship. Some people have to take a cab because they need groceries. They need prescription drugs and they need to go to the doctor," said Ron Klein, the President of the Metropolitan Taxi Commission.

The sun is low when we hit this stretch of trail, as always, yellow rays warming the shoulder of the cream sandstone bluff on the far side of the drainage. We’ve emerged from a large canyon, slickrock walls tapering into muddy cutbanks, cutbanks dwindling into the alluvial fan, left from winter’s rains, that issues from the canyon’s mouth. The tiredness we feel is familiar and comforting.


  Heading south, our footpath parallels the left, or eastern, side of the sandy floodplain, winding through a meadow of rice grass. Last year’s stalks are vanilla and tan, calf-high, delicate and tough, new growth at their bases a thick, deep-green carpet. The path, though rarely traveled, is well-defined, in the way of the desert.


  Today was supposed to be a ski day, spring conditions in full swing, but the area at home closed down because of the global threat posed by a virulent new disease, not to be confused with the various flu, diarrhea, head cold, sore throat and strep bugs that have already swept through the valley. Gripped by a different illness — one that strikes this time of year without fail — Spring Fever, we decided to make a dash for the beloved desert, before a rumored order to stay home could be issued.

Anxiety among people who are sheltering in place is already seen as being on the rise. This group includes children.  


  Children pick up on the emotions of their parents even before they have words to describe their or their parents' emotions. Let's talk about the phrase "shelter in place." This first became commonly used in cases of mass shootings. Therefore, the phrase has some very negative emotions attached to it.  


  We are currently being asked to stay in our homes with little to no contact with others or the world beyond our door. I recently heard a reporter say that this is unprecedented in our history. He was young. He was wrong. This is not so.  


  We used to have homes quarantined on a regular basis in order to protect society. Before vaccination made many childhood diseases virtually controlled there were orders to stay at home and not have outside contact. Diseases such as measles, chickenpox, whooping cough, diphtheria, smallpox and polio led to the entire household being quarantined.  


  As a child I had a mild case of polio. My home was quarantined. My grandparents moved in to help my mother and father care for me. My aunt brought needed groceries and left them at the door. Today we have delivery or drive by pick-up for needed supplies.  


  To reduce anxiety both children and adults should focus on what they can do to take control of their lives. A feeling of control will reduce feeling helpless.  


  Reinforce that fact that hand washing will reduce their chance of getting the coronavirus. Hand washing with soap and water will destroy the virus cell membrane. That kills the virus. However, you must wash for a long enough period. Sing the "Happy Birthday" song or "God Bless America" through twice and you will have washed the appropriate length of time.  


  Limit television news viewing by children. The focus of television news currently is on the death rate and lack of supplies for hospitals. This is legitimate, but not for child consumption. If your child asks about what they have heard, answer them honestly. This is a very serious virus that causes many deaths, but most people survive and adults are working to solve the supply problem.  


  Stress that you are keeping them safe by staying indoors. This will let them know that you are in charge. Children need adults to be in charge.  


  Make sure your children stay in touch with others by phone or computer. Even elementary students will benefit from contact with friends. It may not seem like an important conversation to you, but it is to them. Also, make sure they have contact with family. It will be important for them to talk to loved ones, especially grandparents, so they will know they are well.  


  This is also a good time to do the chores you have been putting off. Involve your children in cleaning up around the house. Sort through clothes and toys they have outgrown and box or bag them to be given away later. This reinforces to your child that there will be a "later."  


  Have your children help with meals. This can be a learning experience. Ask your child to pick out what you are going to have for dinner. Young ones will learn you cannot have three cans of fruit and ice cream for dessert and the older ones will learn to plan with the ingredients you have on hand.  


  Finally, read. A book can mentally take you far away from home and teach you many things.

Jesus’ saying is a reminder that everything under the sun is in a state of decay and dissolution. Eventually, everything will pass away. The only thing that is eternal is God. Hope for the future is to be found by putting our trust in this eternal God as He has been revealed to us in Jesus Christ who will see us through an unknown future.
 The title song from the 1994 award-winning album by Alison Krauss and the Cox Family, would seem to have special meaning during this difficult time. Alison wrote: “I don’t know about tomorrow, I just live from day to day. I don’t borrow from its sunshine for its skies may turn to gray. I don’t worry o’er the future for I know what Jesus said, and today I’ll walk beside Him for He knows what is ahead. Many things about tomorrow I don’t seem to understand, but I know who holds tomorrow, and I know who holds my hand.”
 In verse three, Alison makes reference to where in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus talks about how since God takes care of the birds of the air, He will more surely take care of us during hard times. “I don’t know about tomorrow, it may bring me poverty, but the One who feeds the sparrow is the One who stands by me and the path that is my portion may be through the flame or flood, but His presence goes before me and it’s covered with his Blood.”
 History is a reminder that uncertainty is a part of the human experience. Today’s coronavirus pandemic harkens back to the flu pandemic of 1918. A visit to graveyards across Indiana, will show a disproportionate amount of burials during that year. In high school European history, I read about the Black Plagues which swept the continent. And just like civilization made it through previous pandemics, it will make it through today. Furthermore, we as individuals will make it through, if we put our hand in the hand of the one who holds tomorrow.

  No more is this in evidence than in the reduced business local hotels are seeing. On the average Friday, the YO Ranch Hotel and Conference Center usually sees about 180 people checking in. But on Friday of this week, there were only five — even after transferring reservations from its sister property, The Inn of the Hills, which has closed until May.


  “We are struggling, our occupancy certainly is low,” said John Tait, who was working the YO’s front desk Friday afternoon. He said he’s never seen anything like it in his five years with the company.

James "Jim" Edwin Davis James "Jim" Edwin Davis, 61, passed away Monday, March 23, 2020, at his home in Round Hill, Va. Jim was born November 26, 1958, in Bedford, Virginia, the son of William and Hilda Davis. Surviving are his wife of 38 years, Nancy; son, Matthew; daughter, Kathleen; and siblings, William (Susan Davis), Brenda (Renwick Rohadfox), Margaret (Dwain Branham), and George (Tina Davis). A juggernaut (Jim's favorite word) in every way, Jim was a larger than life influence on anyone and everyone he came in contact with. His loves in life were his family, friends, work, travel, hiking and golfing. Some of Jim and Nancy's favorite times were hiking with their children, Matt and Kathleen in the North Carolina mountains, Glacier, Yosemite, Maine and Vermont. His 18 years of work for BB&T led him to become an Executive Vice President for the Corporate Banking group and a mentor and friend to many he worked with. He loved and valued the relationships he developed and helping his colleagues to grow. He loved to travel, exploring new places with his family and creating shared memories. You could always count on Jim to find a stranger that knew a mutual friend no matter where he was. He loved meeting new people and could strike up a conversation with anyone he met. He found a distraction from the day to day on the golf course. He spent many weekends walking the course with friends, always playing better if there was competition on the line.

Most of us live our lives unconscious of the chances we take every day. We move forward with confidence and assurance that everything will be “OK.” Nevertheless, there is always the possibility that something may go wrong, and all of our best laid plans will go up in smoke. If this is the case, how?
 In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says, “Do not store for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal; but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is there your heart will be also.” (Matt. 6:19-21) If Jesus was giving this sermon today he might want to add “virus” to the list of things that can consume our treasure.

“We can’t assume (there are no cases) because not everybody is getting tested,” she said.
 Fineran emphasized “social distancing” to help slow the spread.
 “Stay home if you don’t need to go out,” she said. “If you are in those higher-risk categories, such as over the age of 60 or have an underlying health condition, stay home. Have somebody else do the running for you. Order your stuff online, have it delivered or curbside pickup.”
 Individuals who are ill should stay home.

 Muck said morale at CCMH is good.
 “This can be very scary, especially when you are seeing the news all the time and all you’re seeing everywhere is COVID-19,” she said.
 The hospital has been communicating daily with staff about the planning that is taking place.
 “I think knowing and understanding what’s happening has really helped with that,” she said.
 The hospital has a lot of resources available for staff members who are feeling stressed, she said.
 “Were doing what we can,” Rasmussen said. “We’re making rounds and if they have questions we encourage them to ask questions. If they have anxiety or fears we’re trying to help allay those fears.”
 She said she didn’t think morale had changed at CCMH.
 “We’re planning for the worst, hoping for the best,” Muck said.
 The medical staff has been calm, cool and collected, she said.
 “They are doing a nice job taking a lead on a lot of the planning and they’re doing a great job and working with the staff quite nicely,” Muck said. “I’m really quite proud of them.”
 Fineran said Public Health has implemented social distancing in the office.
 Several Public Health staff members are working from home, but otherwise the office is functioning normally, she said.
 “We’re seeing our patients, we’re doing what we need to do, and carrying on,” Fineran said.
 Rasmussen said her role as CCMH infection preventionist has been elevated due to the pandemic.
 Her focus for the last two months has been on getting the hospital prepared.
 She has had meetings with Public Health and the county coalition of healthcare providers.
 “It’s not just the hospital, it’s not just Public Health,” Rasmussen said. “It’s our community and we need to get the community people together (and) make sure everyone is on the same page.”
 Muck, Rasmussen and Fineran all said that their organizations have seen increased workloads in recent weeks.

As of today, the scale of what’s happening across Texas continues to unfold, and we’re nowhere near out of the woods on this pandemic.


  On Friday, there were 1,937 cases of coronavirus across the state, and 26 deaths have been reported. The virus has disrupted every facet of our lives.


  It’s also made people panicky and fearful. Out of that, it’s easy to point a finger at people for how they handle situations. That’s certainly what has happened to The Kerrville Daily Times. We understand it, and we accept the criticism of those critical of us for not immediately printing a story about the exposure.


  However, there are many things to consider, from the safety of our employees to the timing of when complete information was received to the many legal considerations regarding privacy and employee relations. It was not an easy time for our staff.


  When this newspaper found out about the exposure, Publisher Carlina Villalpando immediately notified the employees just before 5 p.m. Monday. That left no time for employees to be tested or consult doctors, and at that point, employees only knew they may have been exposed but not when, to what extent or by whom.

Florida is a perennial swing state, and one Trump must win come November — plus he recently moved his residence from New York to Florida. It also has a population of 21 million with a large percentage of older people, who are particularly vulnerable to the virus.


  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said he did not talk about quarantining the tri-state area in his recent conversation with Trump, and learned of the president's comments as he walked into Saturday's daily briefing.


  "Until further notified we're going to keep doing exactly what we're doing, because we believe the data and the facts are on our side in terms of this aggressive, as aggressive as any American state right now, in terms of social distancing and flattening the curve," he said.


  The quarantine idea comes a day after the president took a round of steps to expand the federal government's role in helping produce critically needed supplies to fight the coronavirus pandemic, even as he warned the leaders of hard-hit states not to cross him.


  "I want them to be appreciative," Trump said Friday after the White House announced he would be using the powers granted to him under the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to try to compel auto giant General Motors to produce ventilators.


  Yet Trump — who hours earlier had suggested the need for the devices was being overblown — rejected any criticism of the federal government's response to a ballooning public health crisis that a month ago he predicted would be over by now.


  Trump said he had instructed Vice President Mike Pence not to call the governors of Washington or Michigan — two coronavirus hotspots — because of their public criticism. "If they don't treat you right, I don't call," Trump said.


  In Norfolk, Trump saw off the ship with a speech before only a few people and then watched as the USS Comfort slowly made its way out of port. The 1,000-bed hospital ship had been undergoing planned maintenance, but was rushed back into service to aid the city.


  It is scheduled to arrive Monday at a Manhattan pier a week after its sister ship, the USNS Mercy, arrived in Los Angeles to preform similar duty on the West Coast.


  "We will stop at nothing to protect the health of New Yorkers and the health of the people of our country in their hour of need," Trump said.


  The ship has 12 operating rooms as well as radiology suites and a CT scanner. It also has ICU beds, a lab and a pharmacy. The 1,100 or so medical staff on board are mostly active duty service members from the U.S. Navy, and some reservists, who serve on the East Coast.


  The president acknowledged that making the 140-mile trip to Naval Station Norfolk wasn't necessary, but said he did it to recognize the work of sailors and medical professionals who worked to get the ship out of maintenance more than a week ahead of schedule.


  Trump, 73, is in a high-risk category because of his age, and federal guidance for weeks has advised those in that pool to refrain from non- essential travel of all sorts.

Soon after the legislative session begins many groups converge on the Minnesota Capitol to visit their elected officials with bills they want them to consider, propose, sponsor or cosponsor. So scheduling time to see our elected representatives and senators is very important.
 The Minnesota Chiropractic Association (MCA) has held annual Chiropractic Day at the Capitol since 1984. In 2019, it competed for time with Minnesotans for improving Mental Health. On Thursday Feb. 27, 2020, chiropractic doctors and motorcycle riders aka bikers from all over the state competed for time.
 For the past 20 years, chiropractic doctors have worked with legislators to prevent the auto insurance companies doing business in Minnesota from eliminating the benefits of the no-fault coverage that all Minnesotans have in their auto insurance policies. The MCA also works with our legislators to support programs like MinnesotaCare and Minnesota's Medical Assistance program.
 The Best Western - Capitol Ridge is easy walking distance from the Capitol. Many chiropractors and bikers stayed overnight on Wednesday Feb. 26. Bikers outnumbered chiropractors at least 4 to 1 as they met with elected officials on Thursday, Feb. 27. Dressed in their leathers, bikers were an awesome looking group. Their bills included better health benefits for Minnesota veterans and being able to ride in parades and funerals for their fallen comrades without harassment from disruptive people.
 When the bikers found out who the chiropractors were they were very friendly and respectful. They talked openly about their back injuries and the good results they were getting from their hometown chiropractors.
 Many bikers are also proud veterans. The vets told the chiropractors they too were being treated by their hometown chiropractors for the back injuries and resulting symptoms they received while in the military on active duty or drilling in the reserves.
 They said that after being discharged from active duty they went to the Veterans Affairs clinics to be treated for their now chronic back injuries and the resulting many symptoms. They said their primary VA medical doctors were only treating their back injuries and the symptoms with drugs.
 The vets openly said they wished chiropractors had been with them while on active duty in the military so they could have been treated on the front lines or onboard ship while their back injuries were acute.
 Some vets said when they complained to their primary VA medical doctor that they were not happy with the results they were getting from the symptomatic treatment, their primary VA doctor referred them to a chiropractor for three months to have 12 office visits. They said their back and symptoms got results with the 12 chiropractic office visits but then they had to go back to the VA to continue their symptomatic treatment.
 Apparently, at the present time, the VA only allows their doctors to refer a veteran to a chiropractor for 12 office visits for back injuries that happened when they were on active duty or drilling in the reserves.
 After chiropractors met legislator,s chiropractors went back to the Best Western to conduct their annual business meeting, hold their election of officers for the coming year and get four hours of continuing education.
 Dr. Vincent Pankonin who practices in Perham was elected to be the Minnesota Chiropractic Association president for the coming year June 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021.
 Dr. Wallace Cole who practices in Fergus Falls introduced a bill to the MCA membership that would have chiropractors commissioned in the military as a chiropractic corps. The bill was seconded, discussed and passed by the members. The proposed bill was then referred to the MCA Legislative Committee for further action.
 This proposed bill still needs to be forwarded to congressional representatives and senators to sponsor and cosponsor. However, congressional representatives and senators are only working on the VA side not the active duty military side and now the coronavirus crisis.
 The proposed bill would cover chiropractic services for active duty troops and their dependents when back injuries happen and their symptoms are acute. Chiropractors would join the essential military health care teams who treat active duty military troops on the front lines, on board ships and on every U.S. military base.
 Do you have family or friends on active duty or in the reserves? Would you like to help them have this option in their health care? If so, you can help them by sending the proposed bill to your congressional representatives and senators by contacting Dr. Cole.
 Essential Health Care precautions are now in effect so please contact Cole on his CP 757-777-6022 or email wallycole@juno.com.

This pandemic and its implications have had a significant impact on the nonprofit community, and they need us now more than ever. With so much uncertainty, it might seem daunting to identify ways to support the work of nonprofits.


  However, I believe it is because of this uncertainty that we must step up to assist the nonprofit community. It just might require a little creativity.


  Consider the impact of COVID-19 on nonprofits.


  The Virginia Symphony, the Virginia Arts Festival, the Virginia Stage Company and more have had to cancel performances and seasons. The Chrysler Museum, the Virginia Aquarium, Nauticus and the Virginia Zoo have all had to close.


  Students cannot easily access meals during the school day. Family and work life have been disrupted. Isolation has made it hard to distribute supplies. The Foodbank’s entire business model has been interrupted. Edmarc Hospice cannot receive volunteers for the safety of their patients.


  But for each of these negative impacts, there has been even greater creativity from nonprofits to ensure that needs are still being met.


  Nauticus and the Virginia Aquarium, among many other cultural institutions, have started providing virtual experiences. I watched online as staff members at Nauticus stood next to the shark tank and shared fun shark facts. The Virginia Stage Company is offering free Virtual Stage Workshops with such topics as “Understanding Shakespeare.”


  As members of our community struggle to put food on the table and make ends meet, partnerships have become more critical. The Foodbank has partnered with the YMCA of South Hampton Roads, Mercy Chefs and Senior Services of Southeastern Virginia, to provide meals for seniors, children and low-income families experiencing food insecurity.

The terrifying thing about being exposed to COVID-19 is that you start wondering what’s coming. When does the freight train hit? What does this little ache mean? And then you realize that ache is because you’re 49 and you have terrible posture.


  The only downside is that my mother won’t have to worry about COVID-19 and can return to ramping up her incessant nagging about my current battle to stave off diabetes, but that’s another story.


  The story here is that we are surrounded by remarkable people who didn’t think twice about stepping up to help us during our quarantine, which despite the negative result we will maintain through the end of the month.


  Who would have thought after just a few months of being here, we would be in the presence of so many people who we can count on as being friends and mentors, who are willing to make our life a little bit easier.


  I’d be remiss if I didn’t thank Roy and Lynette Waldrep at Power Hour Christian Center for praying for my family, for Mayor Bill Blackburn offering his prayers to my family, George Eychner called to wish me the best (although he didn’t serenade me with his trumpet from a safe distance), to Leigh Gibson getting us groceries and then dropping them off in a Ralph Lauren bag, to Elizabeth Rose for bringing over vitamin C and essential oils, and to the great Joe Herring Jr. for picking up a prescription for us. Then there was Jeremy Walther and the crew of Pint and Plow who brought coffee. That was particularly awesome.

People who will need assistance immediately are those working in retail, restaurants, the airlines, non-profit organizations, entertainment and travel. Handing out $1,200 checks across the board is wasteful and doesn't make any sense.

“I've heard a lot about force majeure, act of God or fortuitous event. I think it's being used out of context here,” he said. “The reason you would use those words is so that consumers, for example, would not be trying to force airlines to fly when they're not able to. I believe the law is fairly clear the airlines must offer restitution.”

ASTROLOGICAL QUESTION: "I'm a Sagittarius (born Dec. 7, 1956) in love with a Capricorn (born Jan. 3, 1955). Both of our natal Venus signs are in Scorpio. We've been together off and on for 30 years. He just got out of a long-term relationship and hasn't moved forward emotionally. Should I give up?"

“That was crazy. As far as this week, it’s been different every day, depending on who wants to leave their house and who doesn’t,” he said. “ … This week is definitely a lot slower than last week.”

  Similarly, Telluride Bud Company COO Rick Scicchitano said the store tweaked its hours to 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. seven days a week, but that hasn’t necessarily hindered business.


  “Across the board, sales are up,” he said. “It’s just part of people’s lives and maybe it’s how people cope with what is going on.”


  He explained there was an increase in sales the past two weeks, as much as 30 percent year over the year, and it hasn’t fell off so far like other pot- friendly states like Washington and California have experienced recently.

City of Fergus Falls hosted a blood drive with Vitalant, formerly United Blood Services, on March 18 at Nazarene Church which helped collect a total of 33 units of blood products for patients in need.
 A total of 35 individuals volunteered to donate blood and 28 individuals were able to donate at the Vitalant blood drive on March 18. A total of two donors also came forward to donate power red cells (2RBC) which collects two units of red blood cells while returning platelets, plasma and a saline solution back to the donor. There were 12 people who volunteered for the first time.
 Vitalant expressed their gratitude to Shannon Riggle, who coordinated the drive, and city of Fergus Falls Wellness Committee which sponsored the blood drive, as well as others who assisted the day of the drive: Mike Hartwell, Kile Bergren, and Nazarene Church for providing a location for the blood drive.
 Vitalant strives to keep a five-day supply of every blood type on the shelf at all times to be able to meet the needs of patients across the region. Donations from O-negative donors, the universal blood type, are especially important this time of year due to increased accidents and trauma cases.
 Vitalant is the only blood provider to nearly 70 hospitals across the region. The blood supply is dependent on selfless donations from volunteer donors to ensure the lifesaving needs of the region are met.
 About 30% of Vitalant’s blood supply goes to cancer patients across the region and 1 in 7 people entering the hospital will need blood. Those relying on blood in the region receive that lifesaving blood from Vitalant.
 Donors can make a convenient appointment to give blood at www.bloodhero.com or by calling 877-25-VITAL. With each donation, donors receive a free total cholesterol test and earn points in Vitalant's donor rewards program.

"We thought we would make it known that we would provide lunches to any students, and do it 'no questions asked' so we didn't have to worry about the questions if it mattered where the children lived. The only limitation we put on there is they did need to be in school,” explained Jackson’s Pit Gourmet Grill and Bar owner, Ivy Ridenour.

What do we do now? We have to shelter in place in Illinois, meaning that we are called to stay in the house except for bare necessities.
 So, what does it feel like to stay in the house more? I can say we are very excited about this, but what in the world do we do with hours and hours of house time? Playing electronic games, videos, or browse the internet? How about, instead, taking this wonderful opportunity to take a look at relationships? First, let me tell you that I am far from perfect, and also am human, just like we all are; relationships are one of my favorite subjects, so bear with me.
 Gloria and I just had our 10th anniversary, March 19, and I can say we have had a great journey together. So it is like I tell my wife, my goal is to be the best father that has ever been on earth. Please take this right, I don’t feel like I am, I’m just a believer of having a mark and then try to hit it hard. When it comes to relationships, it is work for all of us to have quality relationships with our spouse or child. When the pressures of life hit, like a financial crisis or work overload, it tests out our goals.
 Anyway, first of all, how important are relationships to us? We have to consider that question; if it is not important, then you can stop reading right here. Are relationships as important as eating three times a day? I have found a book, “The Five Love Languages”, by Gary Chapman, to be very helpful.
 Let me share a little example. We may say, why in the world can we do so many nice things for our wife and they still can’t feel our love like we want them to? So in 2018, I told Gloria that for this whole year, I want to give her a card each week — yes, really! That’s 52 cards of appreciation, birthday, anniversary, etc. Wow, so she should really feel my love, right? In 2019, I gave her a bouquet of flowers each month, and for 2020, I told her that I would like to be available a half-hour a week completely just for her.
 “In this half-hour I will do anything for you,” I told her, from washing up floors to doing fix-it jobs, or if she wants to sit and chat about life or pray, we can do that. Wow, so I hit the nail on the head in 2020 — spending time alone with her!
 The other day she told me, “I so appreciated all the bouquets and cards that you gave to me, but this year I can just feel that love penetrating in my heart in a deeper or more meaningful way.”
 Wow, this is something that I feel so unworthy of, we can do all the nice things in the world, but if it does not penetrate the heart, then it tends to make us feel that it is not even worth trying.
 I often think about the saying, “If you treat your wife like a rose, she will bloom like one.”
 For the children, we have what we call a weekly date, meaning every Saturday at noon, Julia, 8, and Austin, 5, know that I will have some time with them, individually. And so what do our dates look like? I normally will get a little drink and snack together and we will just simply sit on the recliner and discuss life, and help sort out their feelings, and also then give them direction. It is like this — if we don’t have a relationship with our children, then someone else will, and who will that someone be? I have also discovered that if there is any guilt that a child is carrying with them, then that is another area we can give all the love we want, but it simply won’t penetrate.

As for the Asia Pacific roof insulation market, which has always been waiting in the wings, it is envisioned to outstrip other regional markets on the back of rapid urbanization in developing nations such as India and China. The awakening industrialization and strong residential and commercial construction activities witnessed in Asia Pacific are also anticipated to raise the bar for growth.
