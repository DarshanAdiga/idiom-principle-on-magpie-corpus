Big Ten is going to give fall football a shot after all. Less than five weeks after pushing football and other fall sports to spring in the name of player safety during the pandemic, the conference changed course Wednesday and said it plans to begin its season the weekend of Oct. 23-24. Each team will play eight games in eight weeks and the conference championship game will be held Dec. 19 — if all goes well. That should give the Big Ten an opportunity to compete for the national championship. The Big Ten said its Council of Presidents and Chancellors voted unanimously Tuesday to restart sports. The vote last month was 11-3 to postpone, with Ohio State, Iowa and Nebraska voting against. The decision to play came after sharp pressure from coaches, players, parents and even President Donald Trump, all of them pushing for a Big Ten football season. The conference is home to a number of battleground states in the November election, and Trump swifly applauded the move in a tweet. The emergence of daily rapid-response COVID-19 testing, not available when university presidents and chancellors decided to pull the plug on the season, helped trigger a re-vote. The Big Ten said it will begin daily antigen testing of its athletes, coaches and staff on Sept. 30. Team positivity rates and population positivity rate thresholds will be used to determine whether teams must halt practice or play. The earliest an athlete will be able to return to game competition would be 21 days following a COVID-19 positive diagnosis. “Everyone associated with the Big Ten should be very proud of the groundbreaking steps that are now being taken to better protect the health and safety of the student-athletes and surrounding communities,” said Dr. Jim Borchers, team physician for Ohio State.

On Tuesday, Major League Baseball announced the logistics behind the 2020 playoffs. This year's postseason will be unprecedented for two reasons: 1) the games, by and large, will be played at neutral sites; and 2) the field will be expanded, from 10 teams to 16, or more than half the sport. If the franchise owners get their wish, the second part will become the new norm.
 Commissioner Rob Manfred told Dave Sheinin of the Washington Post that "an overwhelming majority" of owners had endorsed the expanded postseason even before the pandemic, and that he expects the format to stay beyond the 2020 season.
 This shouldn't come as a particular surprise. An expanded postseason means more playoff games, which, in turn means more playoff broadcast revenue. Once fans are allowed to attend games again, the league will also be making greater sums of gate revenue.
