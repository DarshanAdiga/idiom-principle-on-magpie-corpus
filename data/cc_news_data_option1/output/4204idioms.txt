  _Ritesh Kumar Singh is chief economist of Indonomics Consulting and a former assistant director of the Finance Commission of India._
 A major attraction for international investors looking at India in recent years has been the country's fast-growing middle class, which is estimated to include up to 350 million people.
 However, consumption, which was once a major driver of the economy, now looks more like a deflating balloon as companies selling discretionary goods and services are reporting lower sales.
 But instead of nurturing this vital sector back to life, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- whose economic credentials were supposed to work wonders for growth -- has chosen a path of maximum political expediency that favors rent-seeking, but is actually hurting his most vocal supporters: the relatively affluent middle class.
 So let's pinpoint how Modi government's policies are putting the squeeze on India's middle class
 Firstly, Modi halved corporate income taxes, but kept personal income taxes unchanged. That not only encourages tax avoidance by large businesses, it also puts households at a massive disadvantage, adversely affecting their ability to buy goods and services.
 It is not difficult to understand that high rates of personal income taxes reduce people's disposable income, and in turn their purchasing power. For many middle income earners, those goods and services they want to buy have now been put out of reach due to the outrageously high goods and services tax.
 Take motorbikes and cars, where taxes now add as much as 50% to the purchase price. On top of that, federal and state taxes currently add up to 200% to the cost of buying diesel and petrol, while motor vehicle insurance and car servicing attract an 18% GST rate.

Interrupting other people in order to bring the conversation back to themselves. I am particluarly sensitive to this one, so I look for it all the time and it's astonishing how often this happens. So often a response to a thought or a story is a separate thought or story, instead of a legitimate reaction. A good way to train yourself to stop interrupting is, when you begin a conversation, practice asking 3 questions of the person you're speaking to, and focus on listening and responding. Before you realize it, you will find yourself interested in discussing topics other than…you! People will truly value your company (even more than they do already).

Dann findet fast alles im Kurzpassspiel statt, alles in der Mitte des Feldes. James White fing acht der 17 Completions von Newton am Sonntag, die Rookie- Tight-Ends helfen bisher nicht wirklich - Izzo hatte noch einen Fumble - und Defenses können sich auch auf die Mitte des Feldes einschießen. Fast alles ist zwischen den Field Numbers und kurz, das macht auch das Run Game erheblich schwieriger und schränkt New England hier ebenfalls ein.
 Die Pats-Offense wird wieder dominanter auftreten, wenn David Andrews und Shaq Mason in der Offensive Line zurückkehren. Aber wenn die Patriots wirklich noch in den Januar hinein Alarm machen wollen - und ich sehe das grundlegende Potenzial dafür weiterhin in diesem Team - dann brauchen sie einen Plan B, dann müssen sie schwerer ausrechenbar sein und dann müssen sie auch innerhalb eines Spiels andere Wege finden können.
 A.J. Green hatte gerade gegen die Colts sein bestes Saisonspiel, fing acht Bälle für 96 Yards und war ein Fixpunkt in der Offense. Die Bengals sind noch mehrere Schritte davon entfernt, um die Playoffs zu spielen - Greens Vertrag läuft aus und der 32-Jährige wird noch weiter über den Zenit sein, bis die Bengals wieder angreifen. Ein Day-2-Pick im Draft könnte für die Bengals wertvoller sein als die restliche Saison mit Green. Die Patriots brauchen einen X-Receiver, potenziell auch Tight-End-Hilfe.
 Dann könnte diese Saison in Foxboro noch sehr interessant werden. Andernfalls droht (oberes) Mittelmaß.

Invite some of the wealthiest VIPs to donate door prizes to be raffled off to their fellow VIPs or donated to charity. Use contacts and good PR to book a nice hall somewhere and advise the hall owner to give you the hall for $500 or free so that he can get the free publicity of all these VIPs coming together in one place and getting exposure at this hall. Use $500 for nice looking invitations from a printing company that can also use more exposure and will be willing to reduce their rate to this amount so they could get free advertising on the back of the invitation cards and a logo or name at the bottom of each as a co- sponsor of the event.

Albright sought to cash in to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars on sale of the mobile telephone company PTK, originally a Yugoslav state-owned firm that was "privatized" (i.e., stolen) in 2005 as a joint stock company, but who later dropped her bid when it attracted unwanted publicity. Also in the hunt for Kosovo riches was former NATO Supreme Commander and operational chief of the Kosovo war General Wesley Clark, who reportedly cornered a major share of the occupied province's coal resources under a sweetheart deal that seems to have vanished from public scrutiny since first reported in 2016.

They will also have a straight or nearly straight claw which is a distinguishing feature of the modern framing hammer. The reason framing hammers have that distinctive straight claw rather than the more effective curved nail puller is simple — framers seldom pull nails. Since the advent in the 1830s of balloon framing as we know it today, with its standard dimension lumber, stud walls, and inexpensive wire nails, the frame of a building is generally covered and out of sight when completed. This being the case, framers do not concern themselves overmuch with purely cosmetic details. When a nail is occasionally bent it is more likely to be beaten flat rather than pulled out. While the straight claw can pull out nails, its real purpose is to be used as a wedge or pry bar to separate boards that have been nailed together as temporary bracing or concrete forms.

While each pet owner and pet are unique, similarities arise in the logistics of being a college pet owner. One prime example of this comes through financial situations.
 “When you’re already a broke college student, you have to make it work,” Geiger said.
 Wright and Thomas had the same sentiment. The three of them provide most of the funds for their pets, but one pet in particular presents extra challenges.
 “My parents love Money, but they don’t love the money,” Wright said.
 Still, Wright showed her commitment to taking care of him and providing as much as she could. It wasn’t long until her parents were on board for Money joining Wright on her college journey.
 Another logistical problem comes through housing. While Wright was able to move onto an equestrian property and house Money there, it was slightly different for Geiger and Thomas.
 Geiger first had to pay a pet deposit but had it refunded when Sweetie was officially registered as an ESA. Her roommates all love Sweetie and help Geiger out with taking care of the cat when Geiger has to be away for an extended period of time.
 For Thomas, the ideal pet friendly living was a challenge he was ready to face. He wanted a home with a good backyard that was close to campus, which he found through online house-hunting, giving him comfort when it came to having to rush home to check on Beans. The yard had become one of his and Beans new favorite places to hang out especially during the pandemic.
 “Being able to go outside and play with her is something relatively safe to do,” Thomas said.
 In Norman, college students can pick and choose where they adopt their pet with relative ease. One shelter, Norman Animal Welfare, is located less than a mile away from the University of Oklahoma campus.
 Norman Animal Welfare Center was established in 2016 and has since facilitated thousands of adoptions for the Norman community. Mark Bechtel, shelter manager, said they still have a long way to go and will continue to learn, especially through the pandemic.
 When COVID-19 began to affect small businesses, animal shelters were not excluded. They had to work quickly to adapt to a more virtual and contact-free world, said Bechtel.
 Bechtel said the changes they made have actually benefited the shelter as a whole. By making appointments to visit the shelter mandatory, it has given staff more time to focus on the individual potential adopters instead of working to control traffic within the facility. Bechtel noticed this led to not only a happier staff, but happier visitors.
 “I feel our customer service has greatly improved,” Bechtel said.
 Bechtel said the shelter still has room for more growth. One idea comes from a shelter manager in a different town. There, a group of students involved in Greek life arrived at the shelter and used their social media to advertise the pets up for adoption.
 Soon, every pet in the shelter was adopted.
 Bechtel encouraged all college students to look into adopting a pet or volunteering at the shelter.
 “It’s an un-utilized resource to college students,” Bechtel said.
 During the pandemic, pets could provide comfort to students. Geiger said holding her pet like a baby, even during Zoom classes, reminded her she wasn’t alone. Geiger said her classmates would also get excited when Sweetie would join the meeting.
 Thomas said Beans provided a great kind of companionship that other college students couldn’t get. While some students would talk to themselves in their apartments, Thomas chatted with Beans and developed an almost comical personality for her.
 “She’s like a best friend,” Thomas said.
 Wright said Money provides her a great amount of support, too, even when he’s just out in the stables. She describes him as a coping mechanism for life.
 “He helps me immeasurably,” Wright said. “He helps me get through each day.”

Orientamento alle cure, collaborazione con i servizi territoriali e sensibilizzazione sul tema malattie rare. Sono gli obiettivi del protocollo di intesa firmato nei giorni scorsi dall'IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza di San Giovanni Rotondo (per il tramite dello sportello malattie rare) con la onlus Malattie Rare Alta Murgia (Amaram) con sede ad Altamura.      «Con la firma del protocollo di intesa – ha sottolineato Vincenzo Pallotta, presidente dell'Amaram – rafforziamo ulteriormente una collaborazione lunga diversi anni ormai. Conosciamo bene l'Ospedale di San Giovanni Rotondo, i medici e i ricercatori che ci lavorano, ed è importante, perché spesso la difficoltà di queste famiglie è individuare i professionisti, con nomi e cognomi, formati e con esperienza nella gestione di malattie rare. E in Puglia, devo dire la verità, ce ne sono diversi. In alcuni casi non è necessario fare lunghi viaggi alla ricerca di risposte che sono invece più vicine di quanto si creda.      "Qualcosa sta cambiando anche a livello istituzionale – aggiunge Pallotta –, si sta facendo tanta cultura e informazione sulle malattie rare e questo non può che essere di giovamento a tante famiglie in difficoltà. Noi, grazie ad una squadra di 20 attivisti, sparsi su tutto il territorio nazionale, ci siamo accorti che l'informazione è una risorsa preziosa, come la formazione. Persino conoscere cose basilari – come un piano terapeutico, o la modalità di archiviazione e conservazione di una cartella clinica e dei referti, o la conoscenza dei diritti del malato affetto da malattie rare – può fare la differenza nella vita di tutti giorni».      Solo nel 2019, lo Sportello Malattie Rare, coordinato dal genetista Marco Castori, ha erogato oltre 1200 prestazioni ambulatoriali ed assistito in questo più di 600 persone. Lo Sportello è attivo ufficialmente dal 1° gennaio 2018 e coinvolge più di 20 specialità mediche.

Eventually the bombing stopped in June 1999 when then-Serbian strongman Slobodan Milošević acceded to temporary international occupation of Kosovo on the condition that the province would remain part of Serbia, as codified in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. It was a promise the U.S. and NATO, not to mention their European Union (EU) concubine, had no intention of keeping. Under the nose of the NATO occupation, ostensibly demobilized KLA thugs were given virtually free rein to terrorize the Serbian population, two- thirds of whom were driven out along with Jews and Roma, the rest sheltering in enclaves where they remain to this day. Orthodox Christian churches and monasteries, many of them centuries old, were particular targets for destruction and desecration. KLA commanders - who were also kingpins in the Kosovo Albanian mafia dealing in sex slaves, drugs, weapons, and even human organs \- were handed local administration.

It is important to provide fresh water every day for your flock, even when blizzards blow. Today there are several great electric chicken waterers which keep the water containers from freezing. What a great help! We can’t do that, so I carry out a pail of warm water every morning about 10 am and that lasts the girls all day long. If any ice remains in the rubber dish I use, I take it outside and break the ice out the next day and refill the container.
