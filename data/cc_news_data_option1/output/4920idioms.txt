Lexington police say they’ve responded to 17 non-injury car wrecks and two with injuries since midnight. They’re asking drivers to go slowly on the roads and gives yourself a few more minutes than usual when you have to get somewhere.
 Road crews were out treating the roads early Monday morning. Bridges and overpasses were their first priorities.
 The concern is the mix of rain and snow into the evening will make roads icy and slick.
 “Winter weather has arrived and is probably going to stay. We are ready. Most importantly our residents can rest assured we have the personnel available to make our streets and roads safe,” Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said.
 City officials did emphasize today that while they do have a few employees out in quarantine, they say they are not short on any resources or staff. And are very ready to handle our first snow of the year.

I don't know about you, but I want to know what happened with the so-called China deal. Were those negotiations serious or was Beijing merely stringing along an exceptionally gullible Prime Minister? And if they were serious, is it the Meng thing that got the Chinese to pull the plug and leave Canada with nothing? By the by, they are damned lucky that Trudeau is PM, otherwise any other PM would have cancelled Meng's alleged two Canadian mansions and thrown her sorry ass in jail where she belongs. It should have been tit for tat from Day One. As soon as China snatched the Two Michaels, it should have been nuclear hardball on the part of Ottawa, given the conditions those two men have to endure. But No, this PM let it pass. Is anyone surprised?

Endangered and rare sea turtles nest on the beach, which also is home to rare birds.
