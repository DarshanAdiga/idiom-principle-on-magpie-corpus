“The one thing that all mosquitoes require for reproduction is a source of water. Be sure to turn over or remove anything from your yard that can hold water,” Montgomery County Mosquito Abatement Director Justin Fausek said. “If you have areas where you can’t get rid of water, such as a birdbath or meter box, you can treat it with a larvicide containing BTI instead.”

Vamos 'a rebelarnos como están haciendo en cada punto de protesta', dijo Guaidó en alusión a los numerosos reclamos y refriegas entre ciudadanos y militares que se han registrado en las gasolineras.
 'Lo que quiere Maduro, lo quiere el dictador, es que no estemos movilizados, es que tengas miedo (pero) vamos a seguir movilizados', advirtió.
 INSINUACIONES DE MADURO
 Maduro insinuó el pasado lunes que Guaidó, a quien la Justicia investiga por su presunta implicación en dos incursiones marítimas fallidas a principios de mayo, 'está escondido en una embajada' en Caracas, algo que el opositor negó casi de inmediato a través de su cuenta de Twitter.
 'Estamos enfrentando una verdadera crisis provocada por las sanciones criminales del Gobierno de Estados Unidos', dijo Maduro al ofrecer el balance de un plan de suministro de gasolina. 'Con complicidad del prófugo de la justicia -en alusión a Guaidó-, escondido en una embajada', añadió.
 Aunque el Gobierno tilda a Guaidó de 'prófugo de la justicia', la Fiscalía no ha informado que haya emitido una orden de captura contra el opositor, aunque sí ha abierto varias investigaciones en su contra, la última por su presunta implicación en las dos fallidas incursiones el pasado mes de mayo, que se saldaron con al menos 8 muertos.
 'Justicia, va a haber justicia. Ustedes verán', continuó entonces Maduro sobre Guaidó, siempre sin mencionarlo directamente. EFE
