Boxing’s heavyweight division will be heating up even further this summer, highlighted by a third fight between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder and Anthony Joshua defending his belts against Kubrat Pulev in London. Joshua and Pulev will go first, meeting June 20 in the first boxing bouts at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Joshua, who reclaimed his piece of the heavyweight title in December against Andy Ruiz Jr., will be fighting at home in England for the first time in two years. The date for Fury and Wilder is more fluid, though promoter Bob Arum said he is looking at July 18 at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas. That’s where Fury stopped Wilder in the seventh round last month of their title rematch in a dominating performance that cemented his status on top of the heavyweight division. ``Nothing is set in stone but that’s certainly the date we’re talking about,’’ Arum said Monday. ``We have to meet with the Wilder camp and everybody else and zero in on it, but right now that’s the date we’re looking at.’’ Promoter Eddie Hearn announced the Joshua- Pulev fight on Monday, with Joshua meeting the once-beaten Bulgarian before what is expected to be 70,000 fans at the new stadium. ``A spectacular stadium has been built in north London and I’m honored to bring the boxing community from all over the world to witness us make history with the stadium’s first heavyweight world title fight,’’ Joshua said. ``The belts go back up in the air and nothing will stop me from being victorious.’’ Joshua will defend his piece of the heavyweight title against Pulev, whose only loss was to former champion Wladimir Klitschko nearly 5 1-2 six years ago. It will be the second try at a world title by Pulev, who has won eight straight since being stopped by Klitschko. . ..

After an unusually wet winter last year, many of California’s reservoirs are well above their season average, so state water managers have few fears about near-term shortages. Yet if the coming months remain relatively dry, the state will be dependent on an uncertain future to prevent the state from swinging back into drought conditions.
 “All it takes is an extreme atmospheric river to end up in a high-water situation even if the broader season is dry,” said state hydrologist Michael Anderson, who added that a storm is expected to hit the state in the next couple of weeks. “The two extremes can now coexist in a warmer climate.”
 Historical data, however, suggests there is just a small likelihood of what some call a “March Miracle.”
 Over the last 14 decades, only five of the 20 driest Februaries in downtown Los Angeles were followed by Marches with above-average rainfall, said Bill Patzert, a retired climatologist for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada-Flintridge. San Francisco follows a similar pattern, with only six of 18 relatively dry Februaries leading to above-average March rainfall since 1852, said Jan Null, a meteorologist with Golden Gate Weather Services.
 “You’re running out of time,” said meteorologist David Miskus, who authored the federal government’s most recent U.S. Drought Monitor report on Thursday. “It’d be nice to get a near-normal March, but it looks like you might have to wait until next season.”
 For now, the effects of the dry February can be seen from space — in satellite photos that capture the barren Sierra, and at the region’s ski resorts, desperate for fresh powder. They also can be seen across the state’s ranch lands — where cattle seeking fields of green grass shoots are finding dust instead.
 It has not rained at all in downtown Sacramento in February, making it the driest February on record there in 153 years of record-keeping. The second- driest February was in 1899, when it rained four-tenths of an inch. Though it did rain there in January, it amounted to less than half the monthly average.
 The lack of rain has also meant fewer clouds, which can act as insulation for the region. Without them, February’s average high temperature was 67.6 degrees, or more than 6 degrees warmer than normal for the month, said National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Kurth. Conversely, fewer clouds have also made it colder than average at night.
 The situation is similar in San Francisco, where the city’s downtown hasn’t had any measurable precipitation since late January, marking one of the longest streaks of dry winter days since the peak of the drought in 2015.
 “It seems like you guys either get feast or famine,” Miskus said from his Maryland office. “I guess the normal is to be abnormal.”
 Because of the enduring dryness, Cal fire will probably begin staffing its seasonal firefighters and inmate hand crews earlier than last year, when an exceptionally soggy winter was capped with a surprise storm in May, said Mike Mohler, spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
 A new slate of fuel-reduction and fire break projects are lined up for 2020 to continue last year’s surge of work aimed at protecting rural communities and evacuation routes.
 “It’s a double-edged sword — lots of rain, lots of brush; no rain, dry brush,” Mohler said. “We hate to preach doom and gloom, but it’s the reality we live in.”
 The writing of what could come is already on the wall, Mohler said. A six-acre brush fire broke out at San Bruno Mountain State and County Park south of San Francisco on Friday, the smoldering remnants of a prescribed fire in Mendocino County grew out of control earlier this week, and there was a 100-acre fire near Lake Tahoe in mid-February.

Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador still draws crowds and has the support of the majority of the population, but his once stratospheric popularity appears to be coming back to Earth after more than a year in office. At a weekend event in his native state of Tabasco, where the local and state governments are controlled by his Morena party, López Obrador chided crowd members who booed local officials. It was a seldom seen public critique since López Obrador swept into office with 53% of the vote in 2018. It was a highest percentage of the vote won since 1982 and his popularity once in office had hovered around 85%. However, that popularity has steadily declined as violence and a stalled economy disappoint the citizenry. Two polls conducted at the end of February, one by pollster Buendía and Laredo and another by the newspaper Reforma, put López Obrador's job approval at 62% and 59%, respectively. The first surveyed 1,000 adults at the end of February and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The second interviewed 1,200 people and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 points. With the economy in recession, the imposition of austerity measures and strong criticism coming from violence victims, feminist collectives and leftist groups, López Obrador appears to be governing an increasingly polarized Mexican society. “As for my popularity, we're fine,” López Obrador said Monday in response to a reporter's question. “We have a majority, the people are supporting us.” He blamed the loss of support on frustrated “conservatives.” López Obrador has said he is willing to submit to a popular vote to boot him from office midway through his six-year term.

 Democrats Ed Tarver, Matt Lieberman and Raphael Warnock have also announced that they are running in the special election. If no candidate receives a majority of votes in November, the top-two vote getters will advance to a January runoff.
 Republican Sen. David Perdue, who is running for reelection to a second term in Georgia’s other U.S. Senate race, was also at the Capitol on Monday qualifying. Perdue touted the economy and federal deregulatory efforts, while repeatedly saying he was staying out of the Loeffler-Collins matchup.
 “I’m taking a hard side on the Republican side. I don’t want to go down the road the other side is talking about right now,” Perdue said.
 Democrats Jon Ossoff, Teresa Tomlinson and Sarah Riggs Amico are vying to challenge Perdue.
 Democratic U.S. Rep John Lewis qualified for what would be his 18th term in Congress despite announcing in December that he had Stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

On the fence about the Olympics at the start of the year, Dustin Johnson decided he won't be going. Johnson's manager said in a text message Monday that the FedEx Cup playoffs hold as much importance to Johnson as chasing a gold medal in Tokyo this summer. “I feel certain he would choose otherwise if the timing were different, but feels he is making the best decision under the circumstances,” said David Winkle of Hambric Sports Management. Johnson's name was removed from the Olympic golf ranking Monday afternoon. At No. 5 in the world ranking, he currently would have been No. 3 among Americans behind Brooks Koepka and Justin Thomas. Countries are allowed a maximum of four players in golf provided they are among the top 15 in the world ranking. Golfweek first reported Johnson's decision. Johnson was the leading American for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro when he decided at the last minute to withdraw because of concerns over the Zika virus. This was more about the FedEx Cup and the lucrative prize Johnson has yet to win. The top prize is now worth $15 million. Asked about the Olympics at the beginning of the year, Johnson said he wasn't sure how his schedule would be in the summer with the Tokyo Games coming after the final major and before the FedEx Cup playoffs. “Having had a few close calls in the playoffs, he really wants to win them before his time is done and feels that he wouldn't be giving himself the best opportunity to do so if he added a lengthy international trip,” Winkle said. Johnson plans to play five out of seven weeks through the British Open. He then would have a week off before heading to Japan for the Olympics.

 The speed with which the party elites have coalesced around Biden--and the speed with which the elite political media has jumped on board with them--is hardly a surprise. Those groups have suffered from painful Biden Thirst ever since the former vice president first started musing about running last spring. It went unslaked for months, as Biden managed to fritter away much of the eight years of good will he'd built as Barack Obama's vice president, as well as remind everyone of the guy who'd bungled away two previous presidential campaigns because he often appears to have the brain-to-mouth connection of a car radio stuck on Scan.
 (That issue, by the way, persists. Just last week, he pushed a bizarre--and, apparently, completely fantastical--tale about having been arrested in South Africa while trying to visit Nelson Mandela on Robben Island, That's just completely fcking weird.)

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Recording Academy on Monday fired Deborah Dugan, its former president who called into question the integrity of the Grammy Awards nominations process and said she was sexually harassed by a top lawyer for the organization, which she called a boys' club that coddled and favored powerful men. The academy said the decision was reached after “two exhaustive, costly independent investigations” about Dugan and her allegations. It said the reviews found “consistent management deficiencies and failures,” though no specifics were offered. Dugan had been on administrative leave since mid-January, when she was ousted after a complaint of mistreatment from a longtime Recording Academy employee, which the academy said Monday was one of multiple complaints from people across the organization. Dugan had raised several issues about the way the organization ran and accused its top lawyers of acting inappropriately toward her during a business meeting, which she detailed in a discrimination complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Dugan's attorneys Douglas H. Wigdor and Michael J. Willemin said in a statement that the academy's decision to fire her and immediately notify media outlets \"further demonstrates that it will stop at nothing to protect and maintain a culture of misogyny, discrimination, sexual harassment, corruption and conflicts of interest.\" “The decision is despicable and, in due course, the Academy, it’s leadership and its attorneys will be held accountable under the law,” the statement said. Dugan’s ouster played out days before the academy's most important night, the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that made no mention of her or her allegations of a rigged voting process for some of the ceremony’s top awards. The academy said it had engaged in some...

FORT KENT, Maine (AP) — A Canadian musher crossed the finish line 35 seconds ahead of his closest competitor Monday to win the Can-Am Crown, a 250-mile dog sled race across the wilderness of northern Maine. Denis Tremblay, of Saint Michel des Saints, Quebec, was the Can-Am Crown runner-up four times before notching his dramatic victory. Second-place finisher Katherine Langlais, of Glenwood, New Brunswick, was 12 minutes behind at the start of the final 43-mile sprint, but she closed the gap to 35 seconds for the closest finish in race history, said Can-Am President Dennis Cyr. Andre Longchamps, of Point Route, Quebec, came in third. Neither Tremblay nor Langlais knew how close they were because the hilly course prevented them from seeing each other. Tremblay was surprised after crossing the finish line when he turned to see Langlais coming down the hill behind him, Cyr said. She was equally surprised to see that Tremblay was still at the finish line, he said. The 250-mile Can-Am Crown kicked off Saturday in Fort Kent with mushers from Maine, Minnesota, Iowa and several Canadian provinces. The grueling course took mushers to Portage Lake and then to the town of Allagash before looping back to Fort Kent. Ten-time winner Martin Massicotte, of St. Tite, Quebec, wasn't in the race. He is participating in the 1,000-mile Iditarod across Alaska.
