When Borah High's decorated long distance runner Nathan Green juggled collegiate choices, he had attractive options.
 There was former four time NCAA Division I champion Oklahoma State and Northern Arizona, the 2019 national runner-up.
 Green's final choice will keep him relatively close to home and give him a chance to be part of something bigger than himself. He's headed to the University of Washington.
 “My decision to go to Washington was pretty much based not on the campus or reputation, but the coaching staff and how welcoming they were and their honest plan to create a national championship team and create me into a national champion,” said Green, who made an oral commitment in late August.
 Green's commitment to Washington will involve participation in both cross country and track.
 “I want to help build a team that can win a national championship in cross country and track,” Green said.
 He is chasing a third straight 5A championship this fall. He became the first male to repeat as state champion in 5A last year since 2010-11.
 The pandemic forced cancellation of sports in the spring and cost Green the chance to chase a third straight title in the 1,600 meters and defend a title in the 3,200.
 He's earned three state Gatorade awards in cross country and track. Space doesn't allow a complete listing of all his feats.
 Green is excited there is a cross country season – even if the regular season has been cut back because of COVID-19. The annual Bob Firman Invitational, which Borah hosts, would have been held Saturday at Eagle Island State Park but was canceled.
 It was at the Bob Firman meet last year when Green collapsed and couldn't finish the race. He later learned that he had a heart murmur.
 “My health is pretty good. It seems that I outgrew (the murmur),” Green said. “I'm in as good a shape right now considering all the smoke and COVID conditions.”
 So he was looking forward to a bit of redemption at Bob Firman.

 LAGOS, Sept 23(Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has signed a long-awaited oil-reform bill and it will be formally presented in the Senate as early as next week, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
 The legislation has been in the works for the past 20 years, and the main laws governing Nigeria's oil and gas exploration have not been fully updated since the 1960s because of the contentious nature of any change to oil taxes, terms and revenue-sharing within Nigeria.
 But reforms and regulatory certainty became more pressing this year as low oil prices and a shift towards renewable energy made competition for investment from oil majors tougher.
 The alignment of both chambers with Buhari's All Progressives Congress party has also given the reforms the best chance of passage in years.
 Buhari officially signed the bill late last week, and his team has already been building support for it in the National Assembly.
 The sources, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the assembly has already chosen teams of members who will work most closely on individual portions of the bill.
 Both the Senate and the House of Representatives must approve it before Buhari can sign it into law.
 Two presidential spokesmen declined to comment and the Senate had no immediate comment.
 The Ministry of Petroleum Resources sent the draft, the product of months of consultation between Nigerian officials, oil and gas companies and other industry stakeholders, to Buhari last month.
 Excerpts from the bill seen by Reuters included provisions that would streamline and reduce some oil and gas royalties, boost the amount of money companies pay to local communities and for environmental clean-ups and alter the dispute resolution process between companies and the government.
 It also included measures to push companies to develop gas discoveries and a framework for gas tariffs and delivery.
 Commercialising gas, particularly for use in local power generation, is a core government priority. (Additional reporting by Felix Onuah and Camillus Eboh in Abuja; editing by Barbara Lewis)

The Rams believed they couldn’t find one running back to replace Gurley, the centerpiece of their offense for the past half-decade and one of the NFL’s most productive offensive players over that time. Gurley was released last spring in a money-saving move.
 Henderson, Akers and Brown have teamed up with Thomas Brown, the Rams’ first- year running backs coach, to get better together. Rather than competing for carries or starts, they insist they’re committed to making it work by committee.
 “We’ve just got a great bond,” Henderson said. “We’re always coaching each other up to make sure we’re doing everything the right way. We’re a family, so everybody is close. We’ve got that bond, like a brotherhood. ... The Rams’ running game has always been strong, so we’re just keeping it going.”

 Ten F-35B Joint Strike Fighters embarked the carrier Queen Elizabeth on Tuesday from Portsmouth, England, as part of a multi-month training deployment, according to a Marine Corps news release. It's in preparation for the Queen Elizabeth's inaugural full-length deployment, set to take place next year.
 The Marine Corps F-35s, from Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211, out of Yuma, Arizona, will be joined in training by British F-35Bs from the UK's 617 Squadron, "The Dambusters."
 The Marine Corps and the UK are the only two entities that fly the B-variant of the F-35, which comes equipped with lift fans that allow for short takeoff and vertical landing -- a crucial feature when operating from short flight decks at sea.

 LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Active travel is booming in Britain as millions of commuters, shoppers and schoolchildren get on their bikes to avoid confined spaces on public transport during the COVID-19 pandemic, data from the fitness tracker app Strava showed on Wednesday.
 The city of Liverpool saw the greatest year-on-year rise in cycling, with an increase of more than 220% for people taking at least one trip by bike.
 The UK data, seen exclusively by Reuters, also showed the peak of Britain's cycling popularity growth surge came in May 2020, coinciding with the height of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions across Britain.
 Strava spokesman Gareth Nettleton said the app is now making data freely available to local authorities to help them plan improvements to cycle paths and streets to enable more people to replace car journeys and choose to ride, jog or walk instead.
 "We're desperate for this not to be a COVID blip," Nettleton told Reuters. "We're doing this now - making the data available - because the only way this doesn't become a COVID blip is if infrastructure gets improved on the back of what's happening right now.
 "This is about how we create infrastructure so that active travel is a viable alternative, not just for those in lycra who go for long distances, but for anybody doing the nursery drop-off or going to the shops."
 The data showed that London, where cycle commuting was also growing in popularity before the pandemic, ranked fifth in Strava's growth table, with a rise of 119% - behind Manchester at 169%, Glasgow 146% and Birmingham 134%.
 Across the country as a whole, the analysis - which compared the overall number of people travelling by bike in May 2020 with the same period in 2019 - found that cycling rose by 162%.
 Chris Boardman, a former Olympic cycling gold medallist and now a campaigner for active travel, also urged urban planners to seize the opportunity to take the cycling trend "from a lockdown spike into a long-term solution for the country". (Reporting by Kate Kelland, editing by Ed Osmond)

BOSTON - Whether or not Ron Roenicke remains the Red Sox manager next season could be decided on the upcoming road trip.
 Boston travels to Atlanta for its final three-game series of the season beginning on Friday. Boston chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom will be among the travel party.
 Roenicke's contract includes a one-year club option for the 2021 campaign. The Red Sox entered Wednesday's matchup with the Orioles in last place in the American League East, trailing Baltimore by two games. If the standings remain unchanged, this would mark the club's fourth time closing in the basement since the 2012 season.
 "I haven't talked to him yet about it," Roenicke said. "I know he's going to Atlanta. I'm sure we'll have a conversation somewhere before I leave."
 Roenicke was put in charge during one of the most difficult years in recent Boston memory. Alex Cora left the club by mutual consent in January after Major League Baseball implicated him in an electronic sign-stealing scandal while serving as the bench coach in Houston. Mookie Betts and David Price were traded to the Dodgers in February, a sure sign the Red Sox were content to focus on future seasons.
 Roenicke has also been forced to operate under COVID-19 protocols and adjust to the disruption of the club's daily routine. Additional difficult conversations have centered around social justice and racial equality, culminating in an unplayed game against the Blue Jays on Aug. 27.
 "It's been a weird one for me personally dealing with everything we've had to deal with," Roenicke said Tuesday. "It's nice when we can just talk baseball, which as you know is about half of what we've been able to talk about this year.
 "I've enjoyed the challenges of it for sure. Hopefully next year we'll piece together what we need and what we feel is important to put this team back to where we're competitive."
 Verdugo might be Sox MVP
 Somewhat grudgingly, Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke has divulged the identity of his team's Most Valuable Player this season.
 Roenicke tabbed outfielder Alex Verdugo for the honor when asked a pregame question on Wednesday. Verdugo has made an instant impact with Boston after his offseason trade from the Dodgers, leading the club in runs scored, hits, batting average, on-base percentage and OPS.
 "I hate to make those comments because of the other guys," Roenicke said. "But yes, he would."
 Verdugo returned to the lineup Tuesday night after missing the previous two games due to hamstring tightness. He singled early in the 8-3 victory over Baltimore, extending his hitting streak to nine games. Verdugo is 15-for-37 in that span, mixing in two walks and six runs scored.
 There was certainly external pressure placed on Verdugo to perform. He was the lone big leaguer acquired in the deal that sent Mookie Betts, David Price and cash to Los Angeles. Jeter Downs and Connor Wong have worked at the Red Sox alternate site in Pawtucket throughout the season.
 "I think Verdugo fit in nice," Roenicke said. "We lose Mookie, which is a huge loss as everybody knows, and Verdugo has slipped right in there and done a really good job."
 Arroyo returns
 Christian Arroyo (back spasms) was back in the Red Sox lineup Wednesday.
 The infielder left Saturday's loss to the Yankees suffering from back spasms. Arroyo dove for a pair of ground balls and felt pain on the second attempt.
 Arroyo went through baseball activities on Tuesday and was declared ready to go Wednesday. The warmer weather for the middle game of this three-game set with the Orioles certainly couldn't have hurt his chances to be loose and comfortable. Arroyo entered with 10 hits in as many games with Boston since his August waiver claim from Cleveland.
 "If you look at what Arroyo has done so far, this guy has done everything we've asked him to do," Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke said. "We wanted to see what he was all about."
 The Red Sox have set their starting rotation through the final game of the season on Sunday.
 Chris Mazza is filling the lone open spot for Boston in Friday's series opener at Atlanta. Martin Perez will start the home finale against the Orioles on Thursday while Tanner Houck and Nick Pivetta will wrap up the three-game set against the Braves.
 Red Sox starting pitchers entered Wednesday with a 3.15 earned-run average over their last 16 games. Nathan Eovaldi, Perez and Houck each didn't allow an earned run in their last turn. Mazza was charged with a pair of earned runs in four innings against the Yankees while Pivetta debuted by allowing one earned run in Tuesday's 8-3 victory over Baltimore.
 "Being able to have a solid mix of four pitches - which I showcased tonight pretty well - is what we've been working on," Pivetta said Tuesday. "It paid off tonight."

“We’re going to put them down, put them on racks in the parking lot where their insurance people can get to them but it’s you know, we’re just going to try and keep them safe,” Steber added. “There’s some of them in there that don’t have a scratch on them, so we want to try and keep that from happening. Some of them look like a pancake.”
 Sally caught many by surprise, including much of the charter fishing fleet in Baldwin County. Not only are many of the boats down and damaged, but because of how quickly Sally’s track and strength changed, many boat owners don’t know if their insurance will cover them.
 “Part of our insurance policy is we have to have a storm plan,” explained president of the Alabama Charter Fishing Association, Gary Bryant. “Because the predictions were for a tropical storm going into Mississippi – Louisiana, a lot of the boats that stayed weren’t on their hurricane plan because they didn’t think a hurricane was coming so I’m hoping these insurance companies are going to step up and take care of these businesses.”
 As for the marina, Steber estimate it will take about six months and $600,000 to build back the dry storage building. The docks aren’t insured, but work has already begun fixing damage to them. When the storm hit, work was already underway to renovate the marina and turn it into a tourist destination for fishermen with the addition of motel rooms upstairs. Steber said those plans haven’t changed.

Sept 23 (Reuters) - Rajasthan Royals batsman Sanju Samson said it was an "absolute pleasure" to bat with Steve Smith as the Australian showed no lingering effects from a concussion in helping his side beat Chennai in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Tuesday.
 Smith, who missed Australia's three-match ODI series against England earlier this month after he was hit on the head by a ball in the nets, struck a fluent 69 to guide the Royals to a 16-run victory over the Super Kings.
 He joined the Royals camp last week but his participation in their season- opener had been in doubt until he passed a concussion test.
 The 31-year-old, who opened the batting, smashed four sixes and four boundaries in a 47-ball 69. His second-wicket partnership of 121 with Samson paved the way for the Royals to post a hefty 216-7.
 "Absolute pleasure to bat with him. He is the world's best batsman," said Samson, who was named the Man of the Match for his 32-ball 74. "When he goes out and bats 20 overs, it becomes easy for the others coming in."
 The Super Kings managed 200-6 in response.

 BRUSSELS, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The European Union is unlikely to follow through on a threat to impose sanctions on Turkey after Ankara agreed to talks with Greece over maritime claims on Tuesday, senior EU diplomats and officials said.
 But the progress left an internal EU dispute over Belarus unresolved - Cyprus, which - backed by Greece - is at odds with Turkey over maritime energy resources, is blocking EU sanctions on Minsk until the bloc takes a tougher stance towards Ankara.
 The fate of proposed sanctions on some 40 senior Belarusian officials is up in the air, eroding EU credibility as it seeks to support a pro-democracy movement in Belarus after its Aug. 9 election that the West says was rigged.
 EU sanctions require the support of all 27 member states.
 "I'm afraid that, as things stand right now, we will have to insist on Belarus. It's the only weapon that we have," a Cypriot diplomat told Reuters, saying that the EU had not left Cyprus with a diplomatic way out of the impasse.
 Mediation led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Council President Charles Michel has calmed Greek and Turkish tempers after weeks of tension in the eastern Mediterranean, securing an agreement on Tuesday to restart talks on continental shelf boundaries that broke off in 2016.
 "Dialogue has reduced the need to threaten sanctions on Turkey and so there's no consensus among the 27 for such a step right now," said one EU diplomat.
 Turkey's decision to pull a seismic exploration ship out of disputed waters was seen as helpful. A postponement of Thursday's EU summit in Brussels, due to focus on Turkey, has also served to allow more time, a second diplomat said.
 The summit, which was put off due to a coronavirus incident in Michel's security detail, will now take place on Oct. 1-2.
 Turkey began drilling for oil and gas near Cyprus last year despite warnings from Brussels, amid broader fears of a military escalation in the eastern Mediterranean as Greece and Turkey - who are NATO allies but estranged for years over myriad bilateral disputes - held naval drills in the area.
 Cyprus proposed in June to impose sanctions on Turkish companies and individuals involved in drilling but many EU states say such measures would derail diplomacy.
 "The Turks are playing a clever game. Being more engaging towards Greece, they are trying to drive a wedge between the other members and us," the Cypriot diplomat said. "We seem to have been left by the wayside." (Writing by Robin Emmott Editing by Mark Heinrich)

Gov. Brian Kemp visited Carrollton on Tuesday and told a group of law enforcement firearms instructors that he supports their work.
 Kemp arrived to speak to a conference of the Georgia Association of Law Enforcement Firearms Instructors. Representatives of several law enforcement agencies from across the state were in town for the group’s annual training conference. The four-day event continues today and will finish on Friday.
 In an appearance at the Carrollton Center for the Arts, Kemp discussed the importance of law enforcement and its position in keeping communities safe.
 “While so much of our attention is on the few (law officers) who have violated their oath, I believe we fail to recognize the important action taken by law enforcement to keep our communities safe everyday,” according to Kemp’s prepared remarks.
 “These hometown heroes have gone above and beyond to assist in the fight with COVID-19 and continue to keep countless Georgians safe,” Kemp continued. “And even on the darkest of days, when it seemed like the world abandoned them and demonized their profession, they continue to sacrifice their life for the sake of others.”
 “So today, and every day, I want to say thank you,” the governor continued. “To the public safety officers across our state who follow their training, act with integrity, and work tirelessly to keep the peace, we are eternally grateful for your service.”
 The instructors’ association provides educational services, encourages the development of relevant training programs and criteria for instructor certification for firearms.
 The group was first formed in February of 1990 at Clayton State College in Morrow, Georgia. Membership is available to people who are professionally engaged in firearms training of law enforcement personnel.
 “I want to thank you all for everything you are doing to keep your fellow law enforcement officers safe, to uphold the highest ideals of your oath, and to ensure a safer future for all Georgians,” said Kemp. “None of us knows what may come next, but know that you are not alone.”

Billy Donovan will be the next head coach of the Chicago Bulls, the team announced Tuesday.
 He replaces Jim Boylen, who was let go in August after compiling a record of 39-84 (.317) since he was named Chicago's head coach on Dec. 3, 2018.
 Contract terms were not announced.
 "We are very pleased to welcome Billy and his family to the Chicago Bulls. The success that he has sustained over the course of his coaching career puts him on a different level," said Arturas Karnisovas, the Bulls' executive vice president of basketball operations. "We feel his ability to help his players reach their potential, both individually and collectively, will mesh well with our roster. Whether as a player or as a coach, he has won everywhere his career has taken him, and we hope that will continue here in Chicago."
 Donovan, who came in third in NBA Coach of the Year voting this season, mutually agreed to leave the Thunder earlier this month after Oklahoma City lost Game 7 of the their first-round Western Conference playoff series to the Houston Rockets, 104-102. Donovan, 55, completed the five-year deal with the Thunder that he signed in April 2015.
 Once Donovan became available, he was "aggressively pursued" by Karnisovas, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported.
 Under Donovan, the Thunder were 243-157 (.608) and made five consecutive trips to the playoffs. His winning percentage trails only Nick Nurse (.721), Steve Kerr (.709) and Gregg Popovich (.675) among active coaches.
 In his first season in Oklahoma City, he led the Thunder to a 55-27 record and a berth in the Western Conference finals, which they lost to the Golden State Warriors in seven games.
 Donovan spent the previous 19 years as the head coach at the University of Florida. His teams were 467-186 (.715), and the Gators won back-to-back national championships in 2006 and '07. The Gators also went to the Final Four in 2000, and again in 2014, and had 16 straight wins with 20 or more wins and three with 30 or more wins.
 Donovan played college basketball at Providence and led the Friars to the 1987 Final Four, averaging 20.6 points per game that season as a senior.

City manager salaries have been around $80,000 recently, which is good money for Johnstown, but low by the standards for the job.
 Council is able to pay more to attract outside candidates to Johnstown because of a state grant it secured through the Department of Community and Economic Development.
 "The significant increase is able to happen because of additional aid from the state to come up with an equitable salary," Janakovic said. "It's an Act 47 grant, approved for a three- to four-year period."
 Council held a special meeting Wednesday, conducted by phone conference, to establish procedures for its city manager search process and to approve advertising for the position.
 All members were present for the special meeting as well as Deborah Grass, the city’s coordinator in Act 47, a Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development program for distressed municipalities.
 The council unanimously approved a resolution authorizing the advertisement of the city manager position with a deadline for applications set for Oct. 31. Council expects to fill the position in January.
 Although the former city manager, George Hayfield, formally submitted a letter of resignation on Oct. 31, 2019, Grass advised the council to hold off on the search process while the city handled some ongoing issues.
 John Trant Jr. became interim city manager in December and has handled matters, including the sale of the city’s sewer system to the Greater Johnstown Water Authority, preparing Johnstown to leave Act 47 by October of next year and searching for a new police chief following the resignation of Robert Johnson.
 On Wednesday, council members offered words of gratitude for Trant's service.

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Stefon Diggs is more interested in giving than receiving. Putting aside the AFC-leading numbers the Bills receiver has generated two weeks into his first season in Buffalo, Diggs shifted the focus by instead paying a compliment to quarterback Josh Allen. “If there’s anything I can say, I give all the credit to Josh and his consistency,” Diggs said Wednesday. “His effort in practice, his effort in the games, as far as doing all the right things ... for us to get on the same page and kind of just grow as one,” he added. “And it’s not just me, but with all the receivers.” The suddenly pass-happy Bills are off to a 2-0 start with Allen's 729 yards passing leading the league, and following a 31-28 win at Miami in which he became just Buffalo’s fifth player to top 400 yards. Diggs has been his favorite target in opening the season with two consecutive eight- catch outings, including a 153-yard and one-touchdown receiving performance against the Dolphins. His 239 yards receiving are tied with Atlanta’s Calvin Ridley for the NFL lead. “It’s super early,” Diggs said with a shrug. “I’ll have another conversation with you after Game 16 or like Game 17. I kind of don’t really get caught up too much in that type of stuff because things can change fast.” After knocking off two AFC East pushovers in the Jets and Dolphins, both 0-2, the Bills face a heftier test in hosting the Los Angeles Rams (2-0) on Sunday in a game Diggs will likely be shadowed by star cornerback Jalen Ramsey. And yet, the buzz in Buffalo is growing over how Diggs’ addition has provided a dynamic dimension to a Bills passing attack which already featured established receivers in John Brown and Cole Beasley. Brown, who had a career-best 1,060 yards...

And N'Keal Harry is also on the radar as a No. 3 receiver in all leagues after he had eight catches for 72 yards on 12 targets at Seattle.

VIENNA, Sept 23 (Reuters) - A consumer rights group said on Wednesday it had filed civil lawsuits against the Austrian government over a coronavirus outbreak at the ski resort of Ischgl last winter, but it held off on a class- action suit for the time being.
 The outbreak at Ischgl, which calls itself the "Ibiza of the Alps", was Austria's biggest and helped spread the virus across Europe. Hundreds of Austrians were infected and thousands of foreign tourists say they were too as the virus found a breeding ground in crowded apres-ski bars in February and early March.
 Ischgl's first case was detected on March 7, days after Iceland said that tourists had been infected there and 11 days after Austria's first infections were confirmed. Austria's public health agency has since said it believes the virus arrived in Ischgl far earlier, on Feb. 5.
 The authorities in the province of Tyrol say they responded appropriately given what was known at the time. The private Consumer Protection Association (VSV) argues they reacted too slowly and possibly gave in to pressure from the tourism sector not to act.
 "Yesterday I filed - on behalf of the VSV and the affected tourists or those they left behind - the first four lawsuits against the Republic of Austria at the Provincial Civil Court in Vienna," lawyer Alexander Klauser said in a VSV statement.
 The lawsuits were on behalf of individuals, the statement said. At least three related to the Ischgl area.
 The VSV, a group led by consumer rights activist and former environmentalist lawmaker Peter Kolba, has for months been publishing tallies of foreign tourists who say they were infected at Ischgl and other resorts in Tyrol and have signed up for a possible class-action lawsuit.
 The latest tally is 6,170 people in 47 countries, including Britain, the United States and the Netherlands, though most are in Germany. Roughly three- quarters were in Ischgl.
 VSV said it hoped to file a class-action suit next year.
 "As a next step the VSV will try to organise one or multiple large class- action lawsuits next year," it said, also publishing an open letter to Chancellor Sebastian Kurz urging him to reach a settlement because such lawsuits could take "years if not decades".
 Kurz's conservatives also lead the provincial government in Tyrol. Kurz himself announced an immediate quarantine in Ischgl and the surrounding Paznaun Valley on March 13, though tourists were allowed to leave, further fuelling the spread of the virus in what the VSV called a "chaotic" process.

BOSTON -- Four former eBay Inc. employees have agreed to plead guilty to their roles in a campaign of intimidation that included sending live spiders and cockroaches to the home of a Massachusetts couple who ran an online newsletter critical of the auction site, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.
 "Four former employees of #eBay are scheduled to plead guilty on Oct. 8 at 2pm via zoom in federal court in #Boston. The defendants are charged w/ participating in a cyberstalking campaign that targeted a Massachusetts couple," according to a tweet by U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling's office.
 The four expected to plead guilty are Brian Gilbert, 51; Stephanie Popp, 32; Stephanie Stockwell, 26; and Veronica Zea, 26, according to The Boston Globe.
 • Natick couple was targeted for months by 6 then-eBay employees. The employees face federal charges after an 'extensive' campaign of harassment.
 All live in San Jose, California, except for Stockwell, who lives in Redwood City, California.
 They are among seven former eBay employees charged in the case, in which the Massachusetts couple had other disturbing items sent to their home, including a funeral wreath and a bloody pig Halloween mask.
 They are all charged with conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and conspiracy to tamper with a witness. Their lawyers either declined to comment or didn't immediately return emails seeking comment Wednesday.
 The employees also sent pornographic magazines with the husband's name on them to their neighbor's house, planned to break into the couple's garage to install a GPS device on their car, and posted the couple's names and address online, advertising things like yard sales and encouraging strangers to knock on the door if the pair wasn't outside, officials said.
 The suspects engaged in a "systematic campaign fueled by the resources of a Fortune 500 company to emotionally and psychologically terrorize this middle- aged couple in Natick," U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said at a news conference when charges were announced in June.
 An internal investigation was launched after San Jose, California-based eBay was notified by law enforcement of "suspicious actions by its security personnel," company officials wrote in a prepared statement. The employees were ultimately fired, the company said.
 • Another defendant charged in cyberstalking of Natick couple by former eBay employees
 Popp was a senior manager of global intelligence at eBay; Gilbert was senior manager of special operations for eBay's Global Security Team; Stockwell was manager of eBay's Global Intelligence Center; and Zea was an eBay contractor who worked as an intelligence analyst in the Global Intelligence Center. Authorities say they were working at eBay at the time of the alleged harassment.
 Court documents say the couple was targeted after their newsletter published an article in August 2019 about a lawsuit filed by eBay accusing Amazon of poaching its sellers.

HELENA, Mont. (AP) — The Montana Supreme Court said in an opinion released Wednesday that it rejected a Republican-backed bid to get Montana Green Party candidates on the November ballot because a petition to qualify them was not supported by the Green Party itself. The high court upheld District Judge James Reynolds’ Aug. 7 ruling that granted the requests of more than 560 people to remove their names from the petition after they learned the Montana Green Party did not support the effort. The Supreme Court issued an expedited 5-2 ruling on Aug. 19 ahead of Montana’s general election ballot certification, and promised to release a full opinion and analysis at a later date. The justices in the majority stated that the party seeking to qualify for the ballot must present the petition. Because the petition was neither presented nor supported by the Montana Green Party, the secretary of state should not have accepted it, according to the justices. “Quite simply an unauthorized political party or entity cannot present a petition to require a different political party to put the different political party’s candidates on the ballot,” Justice Ingrid Gustafson wrote in the court’s majority opinion. Signature gathering for the petition began early this year. It was later revealed that the Montana Republican Party had bankrolled the $100,000 signature-gathering effort and violated campaign finance laws by not properly reporting the expenditure. Green Party candidates are believed to draw votes away from Democratic candidates. Montana has tight races for both a U.S. Senate and U.S. House seat. Reynolds’ ruling left the Green Party without enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. The secretary of state’s office appealed Reynolds’ ruling. Last month, the...

In 1990, Kaitlyn Szczupak's father Scott opened a transmission and general auto repair facility in Portsmouth called S&S; Transmissions and Auto Repair.
   
 Growing up in the business, she was in awe of her father's ability to fix things that were broken and how he made something useful out of something that came into the shop useless.
   
 Kaitlyn fell in love with the automotive industry and, soon after graduating high school, sat down with her parents to discuss her ambitions in life -- she wanted to take over the family-business one day.
   
 To ensure she was prepared, Szczupak decided to obtain her degree in business management with a focus on small business. She spent her hours away from school at her father's shop to gain insight into operating an automotive facility.
   
 In February 2016, Kaitlyn's father unexpectedly passed away, leaving the family devastated. Gone was her father and mentor. Gone was her mother's best friend.
   
 When most people reach 20 years old, they are still trying to figure out what they want to do in life, but Kaitlyn did not have that luxury. As her family huddled together to grieve and heal, Kaitlyn took charge. She started by filing the necessary paperwork to become the new owner of S&S; Transmissions and Auto Repair.
   
 "As difficult as it was to do, I kept my eyes on my goals and future because this was something I was working towards," said Szczupak, who on Wednesday was named the 2020 Rhode Island Young Entrepreneur of the Year by the Small Business Administration. "I have the best support system behind me, the most important being my mother, she has been by my side through all of it."
   
 During the next three years, Kaitlyn gathered all she had learned from her father and stepped into the management role full-time. Through many bumps in the road, she provided stability to an unsteady situation while finding time to finish her degree in 2017.
   
 By 2019, Kaitlyn was ready to expand the business. She identified a space in Tiverton, at 793 Main Road, that would allow her to reach new customer bases while retaining her existing customers on Aquidneck island. She approached New England Certified Development Corporation to secure an SBA 504 loan, which would cover the purchase of the building and necessary repairs.
   
 "Since signing for the loan, S&S; Transmissions and Auto Repair has been the busiest it has ever been" Kaitlyn said. "Aside from continuing to service existing customers from Aquidneck Island, I have been able to service new customers from five different surrounding locations, as well as build new business relationships with local repair facilities."
   
 The move has demonstrated a steady positive financial flow furthered through promotional financing that S&S; offers to customers who otherwise could not afford the work.
   
 While Kaitlyn finds herself increasingly busy, she still makes sure to find time to give back to the community. Each year she hosts a toy drive for the three veteran hospitals in the area. Kaitlyn even offers to anyone who donates a coupon that can be used for future service, and all the toys collected go to the children of veterans in need.
   
 As an avid animal lover and self-proclaimed "dog mom," Kaitlyn also donates to the Potter League for Animals in Middletown.
   
 When COVID-19 hit, Kaitlyn continued to push the business forward. She applied for and received and a PPP loan from Baycoast Bank that allowed her to continue to keep her staff on payroll. Throughout COVID-19, Kaitlyn has continued to serve the public and S&S; is taking on new employees to expand their services.
   
 Kaitlyn continues to grow the business all while honoring her father's memory. While challenges will always present themselves, Kaitlyn faces them head on with insight and wisdom far beyond her years.
   
 At 24 years old, she owns and operates her own successful business truly embodying the adage that age is just a number.

A couple of recent estate sale finds brought back some of my fondest memories. These two items reminded me of my early days in church.
 Church was about the only place we ever went. We didn’t have a car, but we could walk to church, which was just up the street.
 The “treasures” I found are song books, one that is commonly known as the Red Back Hymnal which was copyrighted in 1951 (and renewed in 1979) by the Tennessee Music and Printing Company. The other is The New Cokesbury Hymnal, published in 1928 by The Cokesbury Press in Nashville, Tenn. Another edition had been published five years earlier.
 One thing that really takes me back to those childhood memories was the singing … and the singing … and the singing! I don’t remember much about the preaching, but the singing caught my ear.
 We sang, of course, for all the regular services. Then there were the “all- night” singings where special trios and quartets and others came from far and near to sing the night away, sometimes concluding with a foot-washing service. I don’t think they ever really went all night, but it sure seemed like it at times. And at the New Year’s Eve Watch Night Service we sang rather than rang in the new year.
 Also on the calendar were monthly Saturday night singings, Sunday afternoon singings and the Decoration Day service (or Homecoming) with preaching and “singing in the afternoon” after a banquet cooked by the church ladies and served on makeshift tables outside (on the “grounds”).
 And if that was not enough singing, we would visit other churches to join them in song or participate in singing schools and hold week-long (and sometimes longer) revival meetings.
 We loved to sing about the Lord and His love and mercy.
 And how could I forget YPE (Young People’s Endeavor) every Saturday night where we sang (and sometimes illustrated with hand motions) “This Little Light of Mine,” “Climb, Climb Up Sunshine Mountain,” “Deep and Wide,” “If You’re Saved and You Know It...” and other choruses telling of God’s love in verse and tune.
 As I have told you before here, the choir at our church in those days consisted of anyone who wanted to “come on up,” and the choir loft was always full of some who could sing pretty well and me who couldn’t carry a tune in a cotton basket but enjoyed trying.
 I don’t recall that there were any formal choir practices, and the choir “director” was Sis. Evelyn or Bro. Jerry or anyone else who would pick a “number” from the songbook and stand before the group and lead the song.
 Most everyone knew all the songs from memory (“by heart”) and also knew the song by its page number in the book. (“Let’s try old No. 112, the 1st and the 3rd.”)The book was the Red Back Hymnal or maybe the camp meeting songbook which included some new songs that were introduced each year at the denomination’s annual camp meeting.
 Of all the songs I’ve sung and listened to in seven decades of church-going, the ones that most resonate are the blessed hymns which never grow old in telling in remarkable verse the Gospel message of God’s love, sacrifice and plan of redemption.
 I’ve requested that only the old hymns be sung at my funeral, but if y’all want to pull out the camp meeting book and select a lively number or two, that would put a smile in my soul! You can even clap your hands and pat your feet if “the spirit moves you.”
 A few years ago, there were a couple of hymn-book singings at The Amp which drew good crowds. Maybe when this virus is behind us we can do that again. I would love to take my Red Back Hymnal and sing along.

Key Pixel 4a (5G) specs have leaked already, and today pretty much everything else has been laid bare, thanks to the German website which revealed Pixel 5 specs not too long ago.
    The report backs up claims that said the Pixel 4a (5G) would have a 6.2 inch OLED display, adding that it will offer a resolution of 2340 x 1080 pixels. It will probably feature an 8MP selfie camera that will be housed in a punch hole cutout. It is also expected to have a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner.
    The phone will likely have a sizeable chin and the display will be protected by the Gorilla Glass 3, which is several generations old at this point.
    The latest report joins a series of other leaks that say the forthcoming phone will sport the Snapdragon 765G, which will be mated with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.
    The publication claims that the Pixel 4a (5G) will get the Sony IMX355 sensor for the main camera. It has a pixel size of 1.4 micrometers and a resolution of 12.2MP. It also offers dual-pixel phase detection autofocus and optical image stabilization.
    The main sensor will supposedly be paired with a 16MP ultra wide angle module with a 107-degree field of view.
    A 3,885mAh battery is apparently tasked with keeping the lights on, and it will support 18W charging via a USB Type-C port. The 3.5 mm headphone jack is presumably staying and the phone will have two stereo speakers. The handset will probably have a plastic body and it will not be water or dust resistant.
    It goes without saying that the Pixel 4a (5G) will come pre-installed with Android 11. The phone will cost $499 in the US and probably €499 in Europe.
   
 ## Alleged Pixel 4a (5G) specs sure ring a bell
    If the specs sound familiar, don't be surprised. The Pixel 4a (5G) sounds like a rehashed Pixel 5 with a few changes.
    To jog your memory,  the Pixel 5 is expected to come with the same chip that will power the Pixel 4a (5G), but it will offer 8GB of RAM, which should make it a hair faster. The two phones will also likely have the same camera specs.
    The Pixel 5 will also have a 90Hz display with the sturdier Corning Gorilla Glass 6 on top, and will probably flaunt a metal and glass body.
    The leaked specs sheet also shows it will have a larger 4,080mAh battery with compatibility for wireless and reverse charging. The Pixel 5 will probably be IP68 rated and it is also expected to be lighter than the Pixel 4a (5G).
    Needless to say, there isn't anything substantial setting the two phones apart, save maybe for the 90Hz screen and a larger battery with support for wireless charging.
    Per recent reports, the phone will be priced between $649 and $699 and we will get to see it on September 30.

Premier Doug Ford cautioned Tuesday that the second wave of COVID-19 in Ontario will "come at us harder than the last one."
 His remarks came on the same day that Canada's top public health official, Dr. Theresa Tam, warned that the country is now at a crossroads when it comes to avoiding a major resurgence of the virus.
 "It will be more challenging than before," said Ford, a prediction based on the growth in COVID-19 cases, the impending flu season, the move to spend more time indoors as the weather gets colder, and the backlog of surgeries and other medical procedures demanding attention.
 Tam said if the status quo is maintained when it comes to how many people are in contact with each other, there will be a surge in infections.
 If people's contacts increase, the epidemic will bounce back faster and stronger, as contagious people spread the virus.
 However, she said if the rate of contacts gets pared back, the epidemic will come under control in most places.
 But how difficult it will be to get the virus under control is still a major question, said Ford.
 "We know that a second wave is coming, we know that it will be more complicated than the first wave, we know it will be more challenging on the system. What we don't know is how bad it will be, how hard we will get hit. Because that's up to all of us, we all have a part to play," he said.
 The Public Health Agency of Canada released its latest modelling Tuesday, predicting up to 155,795 cases and up to 9,300 deaths by early October if the current trajectory of the epidemic continues.
 A complicating factor in the next few months will be flu season, something Ford addressed during his press conference.
 The premier announced the province is rolling out "the largest flu immunization campaign in Ontario's history."
 This is one of several components of the province's action plan for a potential second wave of COVID-19 in the fall, a plan the premier says is so large and complex, it requires multiple days for its details to be rolled out.
 "This is a massive, massive plan, it's very robust, jammed with items. If we lay it all down at once, the message isn't going to get out to the people," said Ford.
 "We know that people in Ontario are anxious about the rise in case numbers - we want people to understand every aspect of the plan," said Health Minister Christine Elliott. She also noted that many of the plan's elements have already been put in place.
 In all, Ontario reported 478 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday, which was the largest jump in daily cases at the provincial level since early May.
 The province is ordering more than five million flu vaccine doses (700,000 more than last year), including 1.3 million high-dose vaccines for seniors; prioritizing early distribution of the flu vaccine to vulnerable populations and making the high-dose vaccines available to seniors through select pharmacies; setting aside an additional $26.5 million for more doses if required; and launching a campaign to encourage members of the public to get the flu shot.
 Elliott explained that the flu vaccination has been proven to reduce emergency room visits and wait times, which in turn will help preserve hospital capacity for any COVID-19 surge. Flu shots will be available "in the coming weeks," said Elliott, at family doctor and nurse practitioners offices, public health units and participating pharmacies for anyone aged five and older.
 Every year, several thousands people are hospitalized with the flu and complications - last year, 280 Ontarians died from the flu, said Elliott.
 On the COVID-19 testing front, Ford praised the initiative by eastern Ontario paramedics over the past weekend that saw more than 2,700 people tested for COVID-19 at a drive-thru site in the parking lot of the Canadian Tire Centre. Ford said he'd like to see this model replicated across the province.
 He also urged Health Canada to green light a rapid testing option for COVID-19.
 "Nothing is more critical than getting this approved … it plays such a massive part in our testing."
 In the days to come, other details of the fall preparedness plan will be rolled out. According to the province, it addresses continued expansion of COVID-19 testing; outbreak management; efforts to reduce heath service backlogs on an accelerated timeline; COVID-19 surge preparation; and the recruitment and retention of health care workers.
 Earlier in the day, the federal government announced it had reached an agreement with pharmaceutical company Sanofi to secure access to up to 72 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine it's working to develop, and has also expanded Canada's claim on doses of a leading vaccine candidate in late-stage testing from Moderna Inc. by 14 million.
 "These contracts reflect our ongoing strategy to secure a diverse range of potential vaccines," Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said Tuesday.
 "In short - when a vaccine is ready, we will be ready to offer it to Canadians in every corner of this country,"
 She also announced that Canada has signed a new agreement with Gilead Sciences and McKesson Canada to secure a supply of up to 150,000 vials of Remdesivir, authorized by Health Canada for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19.
 "This endeavour is imperative as we prepare for all possible scenarios, including a spike in cases into the fall and winter seasons," said Anand.

By the same token, Jews around the world will spend the day in prayer — atoning for their sins, thanking God for his forgiveness, and focusing on self-improvement for the year to come. Because of the day’s importance, Jews focus on prayer so much that they do not eat, drink, or do work.

He said while it was clear to him that work to “transform and democratize” the 1,000-year-old tradition of Western higher education will not be achieved in one generation and that there is a way to go, that “we have taken some important strides” and have become better focused.
 He said it has been fulfilling to watch as community colleges have become “a fully acknowledged branch of higher education in California” and have “matured beyond the attitude of letting our students, many of whom come without elite cultural knowledge of how to succeed in higher education, to ‘sink or swim;’ to have ‘the right to fail.’ ”
 He encouraged those at the school to become leaders and work as part of national and statewide movements to focus on the needs of all students and to continue to “courageously and purposefully take on the struggle against institutionalized racism.”
 Neault called Abu-Ghazaleh “a brilliant leader and a staunch advocate (ensuring) that every Grossmont College student received an excellent education. His insight and compassion will be missed.”

N.C. State reported more than 30 clusters of COVID-19 since classes began in August, The News & Observer of Raleigh reported. According to the school, students contracted COVID-19 in residence halls, fraternity and sorority houses and in off-campus apartments.

The people I spoke with at NYPA certainly seemed adept and understood the electric vehicle charging landscape. This is the first real consumer facing product for the utility however and there are going to be some hiccups. The company doesn't need to make a profit, but they do need to break even so covering the costs on these stations will be expensive. I'm just very hopeful that the experience is a good one for EV drivers.
