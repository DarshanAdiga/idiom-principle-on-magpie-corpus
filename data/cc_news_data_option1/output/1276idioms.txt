That being said, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX really isn't that hard of a game. Unless you like to go off the beaten path, it can be easily cleared without any massive roadblocks. Sure, you might lose a few times, but that is more down to the mistakes you've made. The game makes it easy to track what you're doing, giving you multiple attack and defense options, even in dire times. Outside of the opening hours, which go by too slow for my liking, I don't think that I'm terribly bothered by this. Now, the post-game on the other hand, that is where things really take a sharp turn. Rescue Team DX really starts throwing punches at you, and wants to see what you're made of. I found this the most thrilling moments I had with the game. There was an unparallelled challenge that took a lot out of me, and made for a brilliant thrill ride.

There is no room for a patchwork response. … Next, Mr. Trump must put in charge the commanders who can oversee this life-and-death war, both for the immediate crisis and for planning the eventual easing of restrictions. … Down the road, the reopening will require a delicate state-by-state choreography in which jurisdictions could begin to relax after 14 days of steady reduction in daily case numbers … All of this is going to require an immense amount of investment, planning, personnel, and logistics, as well as skilled leadership, on the order of nothing ever seen in public health in the past century. It will be a tragic failure if complacency turns the United States into a playground for the coronavirus, allowing it to leap for months from one infected population to ignite outbreaks in another.

The gameplay has also lost a lot of its appeal in the years since I played on PC. The superpowers—which range from elemental blasts to the ability to effectively fly—still feel pretty great, and dashing and leaping around Steelport collecting power-ups with superhuman parkour skills is still just as satisfying as it ever was. Regrettably, the game grinds to a massive halt whenever a gunfight starts. Despite your superhuman strength, enemies still deal just as much damage as you’d expect them to in any average third-person shooter, so rushing in with superspeed and punching enemies into next week is rarely a safe option. It’s frustrating having to resort to ducking behind a chest-high wall taking pot shots at aliens when just moments ago I was leaping tall buildings in a single bound. Eventually, you’ll be able to upgrade the Boss enough that you’re literally invincible, but it takes so long to do that that you’re still spending most of the game with pretty sub-par shooting. Toss in quests and a lot of padding, and you’ve got the authentic early-2010s open- world design, warts and all.

weekendpost.co.bw) - President Mokgweetsi Masisi has coined the De Beers 50/50 partnership with Botswana Government as a “marriage” and at the last Diamond Conference he spoke of “renewal of vows” referring to talks between the two parties. The Botswana-De Beers diamond sales deal was renewed into a 10 year union in 2010, it lapses this year in September. However there is a widespread concern that ever since the ongoing talks began, the talks have been taking place in secrecy in Gaborone and London boardrooms. But a lot of public curiosity is about the two parties publicly appearing to be diplomatic about their negotiations and promoting an unbreakable five decade bond. Owner of De Beers, Anglo American, has recently indirectly released a hint red flagging on how dicey it is for the company to be in a business partnership with governments, like the deal with Botswana through their subsidiary. In its recently released annual financial report and notice of AGM, Anglo American hinted that in a deal with Botswana through De Beers there could be, “uncertainty over future business conditions leads to a lack of confidence in making investment decisions, which can influence future financial performance.” Anglo American wanted to highlight “principal risks” that come with the company’s business and political and regulatory concerns were in the basket, with a worry that a deal with government may bring unexpected and uncalculated future changes.

The Center Square) – Florida has started processing workers' compensation claims from “frontline state employees” who said they contracted COVID-19 on the job, but whether that eligibility extends to “essential workers,” such as grocery store employees, remains uncertain.


  Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis this week ordered the state’s Division of Risk Management (DRM) to review workers' compensation claims submitted by state workers “required to interact with potentially infected individuals.” There were 36 claims as of Monday.


  Those workers include law enforcement, firefighters, EMTs, paramedics, correctional officers, health-care workers, child safety investigators and Florida National Guardsmen. The Florida League of Cities also announced last week the Florida Municipal Insurance Trust will cover municipal first responders’ COVID-19 claims.


  “If we’re going to ask our public servants to fight this pandemic on our behalf, they have to know we’ve got their backs if they get sick,” Patronis said. “Workers’ compensation insurance was developed to provide our public servants a way to cover a portion of their lost wages and medical costs, so their families don’t have to worry as much. Providing this important coverage to our men and women on the front line is just the right thing to do.”


  According to the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), the workers' compensation industry’s go-to rate adviser, many state workers’ compensation statutes exclude “ordinary diseases of life,” such as the common cold or flu.


  In early March, however, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) declared coronavirus a “recordable injury,” meaning an employer must notify it when a worker contracts the disease, but didn't say whether a claimant must prove they actually contracted the virus on the job.


  Through Monday, NCCI reported at least 10 states had issued mandates for coverage of coronavirus by health insurers, and state workers’ compensation boards nationwide – including Florida – were addressing workers' compensation issues related to quarantined health-care workers and first-responders.


  Florida joined Washington and Kentucky this month in guaranteeing workers' compensation eligibility for quarantined first-responders and health-care workers.


  Patronis’ order is an acknowledgment the state will give benefit of the doubt to COVID-19 claims from its workers, but it doesn’t mandate other public and private employers do so.


  It also retains the causation provision in state statute that allows agencies – and private employers – to opt out of paying workers' compensation claims if it can be proven a worker contracted the virus while not performing their duties.


  Patronis' order does not extend to many employed in “essential jobs.” Lawyers and activists are lobbying state and federal officials to do so on behalf of grocery store employees, waiters, office workers, delivery drivers and others whose “essential jobs” increase their risk of exposure to COVID-19.


  Following a 14.5 percent increase in 2016, Florida’s workers’ compensation rates have declined three consecutive years – by 11.3 percent in 2018, by 13.4 percent in 2019 and by 7.5 percent in 2020 – making them among the nation’s lowest.


  However, with an anticipated significant increase in workers' compensation claims coinciding with a likely dramatic decline in April payroll workers' compensation payments by businesses, Michael Duff, a workers’ compensation professor at the University of Wyoming, is among those warning employers to “be prepared for the likely end result – skyrocketing premiums,” especially if workers' compensation benefits are further extended.


  “If everybody who gets sick on the job is able to file a compensation claim and everyone is successful, it may bankrupt a company,” Duff told Bloomberg News.

The first exhibit showcases a time before radio when local musicians performed in the town gazebo wearing festive military-inspired outfits. Think “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” and you get the picture. Morgan paints a picture of a time before recorded music where live music was the only way people could enjoy hearing musical tunes. This was a time when drum corps played bass, snare and cymbals separately, so it took a team to do it. Brass instruments were popular in that time period and many are on display in this exhibit. As far as in-home entertainment, the piano was the go-to instrument for music lovers who created their very own version of home theater. You could play it solo or accompany it with various instruments. Singing was encouraged to create the original karaoke. Piano manufacturers created smaller, more- convenient models to supply the demand and soon a huge industry was created.
 Farther along in the museum, the era progresses to the ’30s and ’40s. The drum corps was replaced with the drum kit. One player now could now control the bass, snare and cymbals, which revolutionized the band concept. One drummer combined with a bassist and guitarist could complete a band. Add in a singer, piano or horns and you now have a show. Soon after, amplified instruments were invented so guitarists and bassists could be heard over the din of the horn section. The modern age of music had begun.
 The museum then moves into the ’50s and ’60s—the age of the pop stars—with Elvis Presley and The Beatles featured in the exhibits. They inspired a whole new wave of people who bought instruments so they could learn to play.
 The exhibits ramp up to the ’90s with the advent of synthesizers and modern electric guitars. The tour wraps up with a completely interactive exhibit where visitors can actually play musical instruments hooked up to headphones to create their own jams.
 Morgan explains how this exhibit has grown exponentially since its inception due to its extreme popularity.
 “Our interactive space as it is now was not here 10 years ago,” Morgan says. “It used to have a very small footprint inside the museum and we realized a lot of people spent a lot of time in there. And what’s the point of having all these great musical instruments here if you don’t engage people to let them play and spark their own interest? A retrofit produced the entire interactive gallery you see here that people can spend hours in there if they want to, and some do!”
 MOMM Executive Director Carolyn Grant has been with the museum for a little over 20 years. The museum operates under the umbrella of NAMM, but is its own entity with its own staff and volunteers. She explained MOMM’s history.
 “The museum was originally intended for the music products industry—who NAMM represents—way back in the ’90s. NAMM is one of the oldest trade associations in the United States, founded in 1901. It’s the trade association that represents the interests of the makers and sellers of musical instruments and products. In 2001 it was NAMM’s centennial, so leading up to the centennial, our CEO wanted to create a museum that would honor 100 years of music and products history. So, this original museum was installed as a centennial celebration.”
 The museum was originally open only to NAMM members, but as the word got out, many civic leaders and educators were interested in visiting, so they lobbied NAMM to allow the public.

As a remaster, this collection is stylistically all over the place. There have been visual updates in the map backdrops, character models, and character portraits. Being able to swap the new maps and character portraits with the original versions on the fly is a welcome feature, but the character models are not changeable. These units, which have a very simple, clean, inoffensive look generally end up clashing hard with the more classic, pixelated original backdrop. The portrait swap option only dictates a choice between whether you prefer the more 90s or current anime style and is largely inconsequential except for one or two that haven’t aged well to a hilarious extent. The soundtrack has some good musical pieces, but the tone is similarly disjointed. Some tracks have a more typical medieval fantasy vibe; others are flush with a variety of guitar riffs and a sweeping stringed instrument section which feels haphazard when put together.

Sandwiched between Legoland and the colorful flower beds off the 5 freeway in Carlsbad lies a nondescript office building that looks exactly like the other 10 or so in the complex.
 This is the world headquarters of NAMM, the National Association of Music Merchants. It serves as an advocacy group for businesses that sell or manufacture musical instruments and have been around for more than 100 years. Most people are familiar with NAMM because of its annual convention that rivals Comic-Con. But many are unaware that one half of the first floor of the NAMM building is home to the Museum of Making Music (MOMM).
 B.J. Morgan is in charge of marketing and events at MOMM and served as a guide for San Diego CityBeat on a recent tour of the attraction. The museum is set as a journey through time, starting in the 1890s and progressing to the 1990s. Each exhibit represents 20 years and showcases the type of instruments that were popular in that era, any musical innovation that was key to the era, as well as an insight as to how music stores looked and operated in that time period.

 “This is something that nobody has had to deal with,” David said. “It’s a new event to cut school short.

“Now we’re looking at a pretty serious economic contraction – not just in Wyoming, but across the country,” Robinson said.
 He anticipates that it will take a minimum of six months for the economy to look close to normal, but “it will take a while to unwind all these shutdowns and slowdowns.”
 Thunstrom predicts it will take at least five years to fully recover from the unexpected recession created by COVID-19.
 In the meantime, President Donald Trump last week signed a federal relief package that will soon put cash into the hands of millions of low- and middle- income Americans.
 Some critics, including conservative Wyoming philanthropist Foster Friess, have endorsed reopening businesses to give people a place to spend the money.
 “Will people spend their $1,200 checks if they see businesses shuttered and ‘no toilet paper?’” Friess, wrote in a news release praising Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon for suggesting – not ordering, like other states have – Wyomingites stay home.
 “In addition to the two primary goals of saving lives and avoiding hospital crush, we must also avoid destroying the economy,” Friess said.
 But that interpretation fundamentally misses the point, said UW economist Robert Godby.
 “The point of this relief act is to give people more money in their pockets to make ends meet during these tough times,” Godby said.
 “We’ve gotten to the point in this pandemic where we need to stop the spread of the virus. … If we lose control that way, the death toll will be higher, and it will just take that much longer before the economy can get back up and running again.”
 Godby said that although there are fewer than 100 cases in Wyoming, acting early is necessary if the state wants to avoid unnecessary loss of life and prolonged economic anguish.
 “What’s manageable today in the medical system might be completely unmanageable a week from now,” Godby said. “When we can expect the economy to rebound depends on our success of stopping the virus from spreading now.”

In the sixth inning with two outs the walls came tumbling down for Ardmore. The Rams exploded for three runs to put them in the finals of the tournament. Ardmore picked up only two runs on the great pitching of Frosty Turpen. The Rams defense was really clicking with great plays by Larry Turner, Dwayne Campbell and Gary Perkins, as well as the team work that has put the Rams in the No. One Spot.
 The real excitement was the sixth inning. With two outs Chet Calico hit a hard drive to left field, followed by a single by Frosty Turpen. Dwayne Campbell then hit a Texas Leaguer to right field scoring Calico. Then iron man Gary Perkins slammed a double to drive in another two runs cinching the game.
 Frosty Turpen went the distance on the mound striking out 10 and pitching out of three or four jams. Frosty chalked up his ninth win while carrying only two losses. Ardmore was the toughest team the Rams had to down in the tournament.
 The third and final game of the tournament saw the Rams go against the Okmulgee Bulldogs for the big championship. It took seven innings to wrap it up but the Rams were in control all the way. The final score was 5-0. Doug Hightower won his 12th game of the season by striking out 12 and hitting safely all three times he came to bat. This was the biggest and most outstanding game of his great baseball career with the Rams.
 In the second inning the Rams picked up two runs with always dangerous Chet Calico hitting a double to drive in Calico. Rick Shoemaker drove in Perkins with another good hit. Both Benny McCracken and Doug Hightower scored runs in the fifth and the Rams picked up another run in the sixth to ice the game for the big No. One Rams. It was the highest reward the baseball team could want, the title of “State Champs.”
 All season each individual put forth on the team for the Big Play, on the bench as well as on the field. They put on an outstanding, unselfish effort to attain the Heights of Glory that has been bestowed upon those mighty Rams. Enough cannot be said for each young man on the team. It is just a great feeling to be in a spot where others attain and want to be. Thanks to Coach Melvin Spencer and his group of terrific young men who really “play ball.”

COLUMBUS, Ind. (Gray News) – Pam Edwards might have a coronavirus hit on her hands.The 65-year-old retiree came up with a COVID-19 song this week called “Quarantine.” It’s to the tune of a Beatles classic.“Just trying to sleep Monday night and the random thought ‘quarantine’ came into my mind to the tune of ‘Yesterday,’ Edwards said.“Got up the next morning and jotted down the lyrics ... purely out of boredom! I'm a retired worship leader and led worship many years at the piano. Just can't keep composing, I guess.”With a little help from her husband Andy, Edwards recorded her silly ode to the frustrations of living life under lockdown and posted it to her Facebook account.While she’s singing, Mr. Edwards is doing one goofy thing after another behind her – eating junk food, spraying Lysol, coughing and wearing a surgical mask.It’s all good fun, according to Pam Edwards.“I find humor in EVERYTHING!” she said.It looks like the Edwards family is ready for the long haul and America could use a bit of their lightheartedness.Copyright 2020 Gray Media Group, Inc.

“I’m not tremendously worried about that,” Montgomery said. “I really believe that some point near this thing’s gonna start to flatten out, we’re gonna get some answers, we’re gonna get it under control a little bit more. Now, whether we get to start on time or not, I think that’s pretty well up for grabs. But I think the season is gonna happen. It may be a shortened version of it, there may be some different things going into it, but I think by that point in time we’re gonna get the season in at some point.”
 TU Director of Athletics Derrick Gragg also spoke to media via video teleconference last week — two days after spring football was canceled for the Hurricane.
 “I think there's a lot of discussion around that,” Gragg said then. “Because, again, you want to get back to safety, wellness. Do you play the games? Do you play the games without fans? How are the fans going to respond if this thing does lift? Are they going to be afraid to come out in crowded situations like football games are?
 “So all those types of things are being talked about. I think the main thing with the finances is that I think you can fulfill a contract with ESPN, or whoever you're with, depending on what conference you're in, if you play the games and they're televised, even if you don't have the fans, Now, obviously, you want to have the full experience, because, you know, football is made up of that, historically, with the fans and all that, but I think worst-case scenario that people will be looking at — and we're starting with that — is what if we continue to play the games and have no fans, like we were determined to do with basketball?”
 The NCAA Tournament and several conference basketball tournaments were originally planned to continue without fans in attendance when the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged. The American Athletic Conference did not tip off any games before the tournament was ultimately canceled, though. Like college basketball, playing college football games in empty stadiums will most likely be the first step before actually cancelling games if the situation does not change.

In linea con le esternazioni, e con i calcoli, fatti su scala nazionale dal leader della Lega Matteo Salvini, anche il coordinamento comunale con la nuova denominazione: Lega Salvini premier, ha fatto le stesse osservazioni sui 330.207,92 euro che il governo ha destinato al comune di Carrara per affrontare l'emergenza alimentare a seguito della diffusione del coronavirus, definendo la somma del tutto insufficiente per risolvere i crescenti problemi alimentari di una popolazione che ha dovuto sospendere la quasi totalità delle attività economiche per limitare la diffusione della pandemia.


  “Rivolgiamo un appello all'amministrazione comunale di Carrara – ha detto Nicola Pieruccini, coordinatore comunale di Lega Salvini premier - investire, almeno in questa occasione, le esigue risolse in arrivo in modo trasparente e aperto a tutti coloro che ne hanno veramente bisogno. Ci auguriamo quindi che destinatari di tali aiuti non siano soltanto le persone già precedentemente seguite dai servizi sociali perché questa misura si rivolge soprattutto ai “nuovi” poveri, ovvero quelli che hanno condizioni di estrema necessità soprattutto a seguito dell'ultima drammatica diffusione del virus. Anche perché, dai vari censimenti è emerso che già prima del diffondersi della pandemia i carraresi in stato di povertà erano oltre cinque mila e, facendo una semplice divisione matematica, se dividiamo la somma stanziata dal governo per il numero dei poveri carraresi la cifra che emerge è di due euro al giorno per ognuno. Una cifra non solo inadeguata ma assurda e offensiva.


  Pieruccini ha rilanciato la richiesta di chiarimenti sulle intenzioni dell’amministrazione grillina già fatta una settimana fa e rimasta senza risposta in merito ai progetti predisposti per fronteggiare la drammatica emergenza economica, su come intendano spendere le risorse del Fondo di solidarietà che lo stato sta anticipando, e su come credono di identificare le persone in stato di necessità e conseguentemente con quali criteri erogheranno i contributi.


  “La sensazione purtroppo – ha concluso Pieruccini - continua a essere quella che questa giunta sia del tutto inadeguata a gestire la straordinaria situazione che si è creata. Sprovveduti come sono, forse credono che, per affrontare un'emergenza così grave, basti fare una diretta streaming all'ora di cena in cui comunicare i dati dei contagiati trasmessi dall'Asl. Purtroppo non è così, e per aiutare i cittadini servono risorse, capacità progettuale, visione strategica e trasparenza. Esattamente quello che manca a questi amministratori.”

Walking into the sanctuary of Mt. Zion Baptist Church comes natural to Robbie Atkisson.
 It should. After all, she was raised in its pews and her family will always be around Mt. Zion.
 “My grandparents are buried back there in the church cemetery,” Atkisson said. “I’ve been playing the piano, organ and now keyboard here since I was 13.”
 For the second Sunday in a row Atkisson’s fingers didn’t grace the keys for the Mt. Zion congregation to hear. Parishioners of Mt. Zion also didn’t enter the sanctuary of the church to shake the hand or hug Pastor Wayne Wright after his sermon. The spread of the coronavirus has forced churches to go online, but Mt. Zion has found a way to keep Sunday routines in place, albeit a little different as it has started holding its services in the parking lot.
 Wright thought up the idea of a drive-in church while reminiscing about childhood memories. It also keeps the Southern tradition of gathering at church on Sunday.
 “When I was growing up, we would sit in the car and watch movies,” Wright said. “People are wanting to get out of the house. This drive-in gives a chance to minister to everyone who can hear or see.”
 Mt. Zion on Highway 63 near Wind Creek State Park is also broadcasting its service on the internet.
 “It gives us a chance to reach two groups,” Wright said. “We have some members who do not want to get out in this but still want our message.”
 This Sunday, Atkisson stayed in her car. Her husband Bryon worked the sound board and took up an offering.
 “It wouldn't be a Baptist church if we didn’t take up an offering,” Wright joked.
 Instead of standing behind a big wooden pulpit, Wright spoke into a microphone with a small pedestal to hold his Bible and sermon notes on the stoop. He led the sanctuary while preaching from Acts: 21-22.
 “Paul was misunderstood by his friends,” Wright told his congregation sitting in cars Sunday. “He was following God’s will to share God’s love.”
 Wright’s makeshift pulpit moved to the church’s front door was easy, but Atkisson was sidelined as her musical equipment couldn’t be moved outdoors. Atkisson been around a few preachers at Mt. Zion in her decades of service and found herself tapping imaginary keys in her lap as music director O.C. Harrison sang. It’s a Sunday habit years in the making.
 “She is out here playing in her mind,” Wright said. “Her fingers are moving to the music over the speakers.”
 Atkisson said, “I just don’t know what to do.”
 Wright hopes the drive-in service brings some form of normalcy to crisis everyone is facing with COVID-19.
 “I’m just trying to bring some words of encouragement,” Wright said. “You need peace in crisis, but how?”
 Wright wants his congregation and others to continue to praise and pray to God and practice perseverance in sharing His love during the coronavirus crisis and beyond.
 “With trying to stay apart, it’s hard,” Wright said. “We are so used to shaking hands and hugging. How do we practice this social distancing? We wear gloves, cough into our arm, keep our distance and walk with Him.”
 Even with the barriers of glass and steel, Wright found a way to see if his message was getting across.
 “If you get happy, wave your hand out the window,” Wright told his congregation. “Don’t blow your horn; you might scare someone.”
 The warning on the horn lasted until the end of Wright’s sermon where horns sounded in place of people saying amen.
 Wright joked about the first pew being empty as only a few sat on the church’s sidewalk while most stayed in their vehicles. But Atkisson had a solution for next time.
 “They didn’t want to sit there,” Wright said. “They were afraid they’re going to catch the Holy Spirit.”
 Atkisson responded, “We just need some popcorn.”

  All short-term rentals, such as those from Airbnb, and campgrounds and RV parks, are to be closed as well. Scott said officials still are seeing advertisements for lodging and online booking continue to take place. Monday’s order suspended online reservations.


  “Our message is this: If you are entering the state, you are directed to isolate in order to protect those already here as well as the capacity of our health care system. This will help protect those currently in the state while allowing people who own a home, have a family, to be here as well,” Scott said.


  He said he didn’t want the situation to turn into “us vs. them,” with Vermonters turning on those from elsewhere.


  “That’s not who we are as Americans and certainly not as Vermonters. And we shouldn’t let anything change that,” he said.


  When it comes to enforcing the order, Vermont Attorney General T.J.

Donovan said Scott’s order does carry with it penalties for those found to have violated it. They include fines up to $10,000 per violation, and someone could be charged with a crime that has a maximum sentence of six months behind bars.


  “I want to be very clear, the last thing any of us want to do is enforce these orders and seek those penalties. We’re asking for your compliance, and we’re asking for your cooperation. That being said, we also know that we all have a role to play during this crisis. We’re prepared to do our job,” he said.


  The order is in effect until April 15, but Scott said Monday that deadline is expected to be extended.

“The Navy Pier was still active with supply and refueling ships stationed there. The skyline had only a handful of high-rise buildings and there were no condo towers to be seen.”
 Fred Duckett, along with co-founder Bob Wilson, started the restaurant as a hobby, an outlet for Duckett’s love of harpooning California swordfish. They brought on Dean Betts, a fish cook who still prefers not to be called “chef,” and former boat captain John Freis to help manage the operation.
 Another original Fish Market employee still with the restaurant is fishmonger Darren Gorski, who cultivates relationships with the fishermen to get the best catch for the restaurant.
 “Darren is the heart and soul of our retail seafood operation,” Colton says. “He has had a lifelong connection with fishing, growing up on the Jersey Shore and working charter boats before relocating to San Diego to do more of the same. I like to say that Darren has forgotten more about seafood than I will ever know.”
 The Fish Market culinary signature is fresh, sustainable seafood prepared simply. Its original mesquite grilled fish is what made them famous, charcoal burning hot to sear in the flavor and moisture. Shawn Bell, who joined The Fish Market as food and beverage director just over a year ago, is adding new dishes to the beloved classics, introducing menu items such as a yellowfin tuna poke bowl, a panang curry and a scallop succotash entrée.
 Upstairs at Top of the Market, Executive Chef Jeremy Loomis elevates the fresh seafood with innovative flavors.
 “The pillars of the modern experience Executive Chef Loomis provides are the use of unique, seasonal produce, a scratch approach to preparation and a willingness to utilize a variety of cultural styles,” Colton describes. “For example, he sourced lobster mushrooms for a play on our seafood-forward cuisine with a nonseafood item. He orders the steaks we serve as whole cuts and breaks them down in-house, just like our seafood, to ensure he gets the exact specifications he’s seeking.”

Home buyers who have paid their deposit and signed a purchase contract, who may now want to get out of the purchase since the pandemic hit, do not have a standard “Force majeure” or “Act of God” clause that will let them walk away, said Richard Bell of Bell Alliance in Vancouver. Such a clause would need to have been specifically written into the purchase contract to be applicable, which is unlikely, he said.

Throwing another wild card into the mix, President Donald Trump on Tuesday blindsided congressional Republicans and embraced using the next round for a massive infrastructure package. Many in both parties have supported such a program before, but some Republicans have opposed it as too costly and there have long been crippling disagreements over how to pay for it.
 “It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4,” Trump tweeted.
 There seems little doubt that if the economy remains near its current morbid state, the major question facing lawmakers will be what the next bill should look like, not whether to have one. Growing numbers of business close by the day, consumer spending is plummeting and millions are losing jobs as much of the country shelters at home, a devil's brew that could be lethal for politicians to ignore before November's presidential and congressional elections.
 “I think there's a deal to be had this time" on infrastructure, said Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Still, he said reaching agreement on another expensive package could be harder after last week's enormous $2.2 trillion bill.
 “We've already broken apart our grandkids' piggy bank, we're now getting into the great-grandkids' piggy banks, so let's be thoughtful on this,” he said.
 Stephen Moore, a former Trump senior adviser now with the conservative pro- business Committee to Unleash Prosperity, said he envisioned major problems for Congress in reaching an agreement. He said while the economy will likely need another large cash infusion to recover, Democrats pushing more spending will clash with Republicans eager to use tax cuts instead, such as suspending employers' payroll tax like Trump has proposed.

But Comcast's commitment to "fairness" coincidentally doesn't apply in the Northeast United States, where it faces strong competition from Verizon's un- capped fiber-to-the-home FiOS service. Comcast was giving customers in the Northeast states unlimited data all along, even before the pandemic, despite imposing the caps in 27 other states. Customers in Northeastern states don't experience this particular brand of Comcast-imposed "fairness," but those customers don't seem to mind since they can use their Internet as much as they like without paying overage fees.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The bipartisan partnership that propelled a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package through Congress just days ago is already showing signs of strain, raising questions about how quickly calls for massive followup legislation may bear fruit.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and fellow Democrats are collecting ideas for the next stab at stabilizing an economy knocked into free fall by the coronavirus outbreak. Their proposals include money for extended unemployment benefits, state and local governments, hospitals and a job- creating infrastructure program, plus expanded job protections and benefits for workers.
 “It's a wonderful opportunity," Pelosi told reporters this week, “because I think our country is united in wanting to not only address the immediate needs of the emergency and mitigation for the assault on our lives and livelihood, but also how we recover in a very positive way.”
 Congress' top Republicans say not so fast. They want lawmakers to gauge how well the huge, newly-minted bailout programs are working and how the economy is behaving. And they're accusing Pelosi of planning to use the next bill to win Democratic priorities like environmental requirements and moving the country toward ballot by mail elections.
 “Let’s see how things are going and respond accordingly,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday on Hugh Hewitt's talk radio show. He said that could take weeks and added, “I would think any kind of bill coming out of the House I would look at like Reagan suggested we look at the Russians – trust, but verify."
 “I'm not sure we need a fourth package,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.”

What is available for officers with both the LOPD and SCSO is social distancing, as hard as that can be for them to do, at times.
 But when possible, it is a tool to utilize.
 “If our officers seem to stand at a greater distance than normal to try and handle the situation, they’re just taking precautions to try and limit exposure for them, us and everybody else,” Davis said. “It’s a battle.”
 St. John added: “Plus, we’re not trying to be rude to anybody but we’re keeping our distance from them and we’re not shaking hands, and then if they suspect something, at that point in time, they take a little more precautions and do what they can to keep their distance.”
 Social distancing is also coming into play at the jail, which is also being sprayed multiple times a day to help kill any virus that may get in. Visitation has been canceled and St. John said attorneys are also being encouraged to stay away. Instead the jail is urging lawyers to call the jail and inmates would have access to a phone in the interview room. St. John added there is a laptop available for video conferencing, if necessary, with judges and attorneys.
 And when officers are bringing new inmates to the jail after arrests, St. John said they are screened with questionnaires provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the likelihood of them being sick with the virus.
 “Any type of thing that may meet the criteria, we’ll mask the person up and go straight to the medical cell and be quarantined there,” St. John said, adding there has not been a prisoner yet that has needed to be quarantined under suspicion of COVID-19.
 If that does happen, once quarantined in the medical cell, the health department would be notified to come and collect a sample for testing.
 “So far we’re good there,” St. John said. “We’re just taking every, every precaution.”

It’s a widely canvassed view, within as well as outside the party, that Labour has progressively lost touch with its grassroots and its traditional base. Indeed, the most dramatic illustration of this supposed trend was offered by the December election, whereat Labour lost seats all across the North of England and the Midlands, most of them for the first time in living memory. As well as the parliamentary party being deemed elitist and London- centric, it was also widely perceived as being dominated by those who wished to remain in the European Union, a group led by none other than Sir Keir Starmer.

This is Green Up Day’s 50th anniversary. It’s a day where people all across the state volunteer to pick up roadside trash, which is gathered in green bags and disposed of at no cost to the volunteer collectors. Some towns host community-building events in tandem with the trash pick up.


  Alberghini said of the 251 towns polled, 130 responded. Of those, 72 said they’d support a move to May 30, a date suggested by Green Up Vermont. Thirty- one towns said to keep it on May 2; 14 didn’t have an opinion; 10 wanted it moved to the fall; three said to cancel it.


  The poll asked towns about moving it to the fall. Alberghini said 23 respondents said “yes” to that question, 41 said “no,” while 56 were neutral or had no answer. A third question asked whether towns would be more comfortable moving ahead with their usual plans if May 30 were the date. Twenty-one said it’s too soon to know that, 31 said “yes,” they’d be more comfortable, while 78 were neutral.


  There was much to consider about moving the date, she said. Pushing the date back means more vegetation making trash hard to spot and more risk of ticks. Going out too far might mean road crews are too busy to offer the help they normally do. Some towns suggested making it an ongoing practice throughout the month of May.


  “We’re trying to find the best possible balance for moving forward with what we know now,” she said. “There are a lot of things we don’t know that we can’t really predict, no one can with this virus. We will just move forward with the 30th, taking all measures of safety precaution that we can and sharing that information and relying on people to be diligent in taking care of themselves as well.”


  Holding the event as-scheduled, she said, would make getting supplies and word out much harder, and the event would lose much of the community-building it’s known for, given people would likely want to follow the social-distancing guidelines now in place.


  “It can be done; Green Up can go on in a socially distant way, but to be cognizant of distribution and how people do want to keep it as a community event, that’s why we decided to push it a little further out,” she said.
