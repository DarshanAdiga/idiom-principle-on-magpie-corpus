Ford spent the 1970s and 1980s trying to get Americans to buy the products of the company's European operations, with lukewarm results for the likes of the Capri, Fiesta, XR4Ti and Scorpio. That plan didn't work out so well, but the first-generation Ford Mondeo proved to be such a hit in Britain that it seemed to make sense to try an American version. Over here, the Ford-badged version became the Contour and its Mercurized sibling the Mystique. Here's a 1998 Mystique in a Phoenix car graveyard; this is a rare find to begin with, but it has the _impossibly_ rare five-speed manual transmission to boot.

When hunting from a blind, remember to sit near the back of the blind, not right in front of the window. This will help to conceal you better. I have actually successfully hunted turkeys in a blind without wearing a facemask or gloves.
 Also, don’t feel the need to brush your blind in. If you can, great, but I have been on numerous successful turkey hunts where we simply popped the blind up in a wide open spot and had birds walk right up to it, and actually brush up against it.

CANTON-With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic officials with the City of Canton continue to stay vigilant for the ever changing, unprecedented situation.
 Unanimously, Monday evening Canton Council voted to pass an ordinance that, if it were to become necessary, the mayor would be able to declare a local state of emergency.
 It is important to note, council simply passed the ordinance.
 NO local state of emergency in Canton had been declared as of Tuesday afternoon.
 City Attorney Chris Jump drafted the ordinance which notes the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-1-6), provides for the declaration of a state of emergency and the grant of extraordinary authority to the mayor by the corporate authorities.
 This ordinance would not just apply in the circumstance of the current pandemic.
 It could be initiated in the event of a tornado, other natural disaster or had it been in place during the explosion it could have been implemented at that point.
 "Some of these things that are set forth in the ordinance may not be applicable here. It doesn't necessarily mean that the mayor is going to impose these. This is simply the ordinance allowing him the authority to do so in the course of the state of emergency," said Jump.
 Jump added the Illinois Municipal League has issued a bit of guidance in regards to communities drafting such an ordinance, "Some of these provisions go a little bit further than that than what was set out by IML. Some of these provisions follow similar provisions that are granted to the governor under the Act which is very much focused on the governor's ability to declare a disaster which he's done. The point here is not panic. The point here is preparedness."
 "That's who we're concerned about right now is our citizens and our employees, keeping everyone safe and doing what we need to," noted Jump.
 Jump said he is hopeful by the time their first regular meeting in April takes place they have guidance from the federal government as far as how they're going to handle FMLA, if they're going to do emergency leave, "That bill remains pending. I think once that's done we may have a little bit better direction on where we're headed that way."
 Alderman John Lovell asked what the criteria was to implement a local state of emergency.
 Said Mayor Kent McDowell, "We're going to follow what the state is doing. They're saying it might be unique to us and not the state."
 Jump concurred, "I don't see any point in duplicating what the governor is ordering."
 "It's like Attorney Jump said there's things I think are important right now for the protection of our employees and citizens that being limiting our gatherings to 50 people or less," said McDowell.
 Additionally, people are no longer allowed to pay their water/sewer bill at HyVee in Canton for the time being.
 Citizens are able to pay online, via mail or place it in the dropbox located near the parking lot of the City Building.
 Alderman Jeff Fritz commented the council cannot be less restrictive than the state is, but they are allowed to be more restrictive.
 "We want to be proactive. In case the bottom falls out we don't want to be standing here scrambling at the last minute," said McDowell.
 McDowell said he wanted to encourage residents to purchase the trash totes available as they would serve as an extra layer of protection for the city sanitation workers.
 They may be purchased online and are able to be delivered to those who purchase them.
 For those who do not use garbage cans, they are asked to double-bag their garbage to protect employees.
 This is not an order, the public is simply being asked.
 If the state of emergency is enacted, all disconnect of water/sewer will be suspended.
 All City Buildings are currently closed to the public.
 Any employee or alderperson is required to show a present City Identification Card if they wish to enter a City Building.
 Should they not have the required card, they will not be allowed in.
 "We, of course," said McDowell, "are hoping and praying this thing will go away. It seems like it changes so drastically second-to-second. We make a decision about something and then, bam, there's another rule or another thing that comes out from the media or the governor's office."
 He concluded by saying, "The most important thing is not to panic. We're going to get through this. We're going to get through this together and I really strongly believe the leadership we have in this room is tremendous. Our citizens are going to be well taken care of and our employees will be taken care of as well."

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Trump administration's coronavirus expert and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, went on Meet the Press Sunday to tell the US elderly population to "think twice" about traveling and "just don't get on a cruise ship."
 In an interview with NBC host Chuck Todd, Fauci was more cautionary in his evaluation of the spread of the virus.
 President Donald Trump recently said that he would prefer that the 3,500 people stuck on the Grand Princess cruise ship so the US coronavirus numbers don't "double."
 Elderly populations have been found to face a higher risk of dying from the virus, the full extent of which has been difficult to gauge in the US because of a slower pace of testing.
 The Associated Press reported that health officials were set to recommend that elderly Americans avoid flying on commercial airlines due to coronavirus concerns, but White House officials overruled them.

When hunting from a blind, getting drawn on turkeys is much easier. Blinds will allow you to pull turkeys in unbelievably close for the shot, and you'll be blown away with the amount of movement you can get away with when concealed within a blind.
 Look for a blind that sets up fast and easy and won't flap in the wind. The window system is also critical for success when bowhunting turkeys. Look for a quiet window system that is easily adjusted on the fly.
 Also, be sure to close the back windows of the blind so you're not caught flashing in the back-light that will come from too many windows being opened.

The Grady County Sheriff’s Office lobby is also closed to the general public. Those who need to contact the sheriff’s office are asked to call first and, if needed, a deputy will meet them in front of the building.
 At this time, the Grady County Sheriff’s Office will only send out a deputy for priority calls where their presence would be required.
 Residents are still able to register to vote and/or file for an absentee ballot or change party affiliation at the Grady County Election Board. Voters are advised to visit wwww.elections.ok.gov and click on the OK Voter Portal to access voter services, if possible.
 The regular Grady County Commissioner meetings on Monday may be held by teleconference or recorded in the future, although this is still developing. Governor Kevin Stitt recently signed an emergency law temporarily adjusting the state’s open meetings law to help curtail the spread of COVID-19.
 The Grady County Commissioners advise that those who would otherwise need to visit the courthouse, call first.
 Earlier this week, the Supreme Court ordered all courts in Oklahoma to immediately cancel all jury terms for the next 30 days and release jurors from service. Civil cases will be extended for 30 days.
 Moreover, assigned judges have been ordered to reschedule all non-jury trial settings hearings and pretrial settings. Emergency matters, assignments, bond hearings and required proceedings of any kind will handled on a case by case basis by the assigned judge.

Fauci said older Americans should take extra precautions when looking to travel.
 "If you're a person with an underlying condition -- and you are particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition -- you need to think twice about getting on a plane or on a long trip," Fauci said. "And not only think twice, just don't get on a cruise ship."
 Later on in the program, the host noted the disparity between the doctor's assessment and the more optimistic messaging coming from Trump.
 "Having the President of the United States say that would have a lot more impact than Dr. Fauci, but he just won't say that," Todd said.
