Wood County Community Health Center and the Ohio National Guard are partnering to provide COVID-19 testing at the health center located at 1840 E. Gypsy Lane Road in Bowling Green. This will take place on Tuesday June 30 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tests will be administered from the parking lot while you remain in your car.
 Testing will be available for people of all ages, including those without symptoms. No physician order is required and there is no out of pocket cost. Test results will be available in 3-5 days. This testing is available to everyone and not restricted to Wood County residents.
 Governor Mike DeWine said, “The COVID-19 Minority Health Strike Force has worked with local partners to create pop-up testing sites in communities where access to testing may be limited. By joining with the Ohio National Guard and other local partners, we can provide tests to any Ohioan who wants one. With a better understanding of COVID-19 through increased testing, we’ll be better able to prevent its spread.”
 “This is just another example of the Wood County Community Health Center’s team approach to providing health care services to everyone in the community. We feel strongly that this is the next step to take as we work to safely reopen our communities and protect against further spread of COVID-19”, said Diane Krill, CEO, Wood County Community Health Center.

And even as the organization is bolstered by a recent surge in donations, Stewart is committed to making sure its fundamental mission remains front and center: The Okra Project is for and by the Black trans community.

As a moon orbits a planet, its gravity tugs a bit on the planet – a process called tidal friction – creating strain and a resulting very slight bulge on the planet. On Earth, this bulge happens most noticably in our oceans – called a tidal bulge – and causes the cycle of high and low tides, but planets without oceans can bulge, too. This cyclic process of bulging and then subsequent relaxing creates a lot of energy over a long period of time. Tidal friction, however, also prevents the tidal bulge on Earth from remaining directly beneath the moon; instead it is carried along with the rotation of the Earth. The energy, created by mutual attraction between the moon and the material in the bulge, accelerates the moon slightly in its orbit. This causes the moon to drift a tiny bit farther away from Earth over time.

Nobody desires adversity as a teacher in life, at least nobody I’ve ever known. But for those “silient” folks they do appreciate difficulty as a teacher, as sandpaper that smooths out the rough edges in life. See every harsh condition in your life as something in front of you to help you gain valuable insights, to learn from, to be grateful for, to engage in self- reflection. Napoleon Hill, author of _Think and Grow Rich,_ framed it this way, “Every adversity has the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.” True “silience” is the ability to cuddle up to adversity and without bouncing anywhere, growing yourself and perhaps even the circumstance you’re facing. Use your next difficulty as energy for your personal growth and you’re fully “silient.”

Still in the running for qualifying for the next edition of the Europa League, AC Milan maintained their chances for that goal by going to Lecce to win on Monday. And the Lombarders did it with art and manner, winning 4-1. It is even their season's greatest success.
 Stefano Pioli asked his forwards for efficiency at the press conference before the match. The message went perfectly, seen for once the job was well done in the forefront, with 11 shots on goal, four of which ended up on the back of the net. And the creations were signed by four different players.
 It was Samu Castillejo who was the first to strike against a service from Hakan Calhanoglu (26th). The local team then managed to stick to the mark, but their relief was only short-lived (54th). Just under a minute later Milanese is back thanks to Giacomo Bonaventura (55th). Then Ante Rebic used a Calhanoglu "assist" to score his 7th goal in as many matches. Finally, Milanese ended the success of former Lille Rafael Leao (77th), head scorer and in the empty goal, on a service from Conti. Note, on the Milanese side, another very convincing performance from Algeria's Ismael Bennacer, although it was not crucial.
 AC Milan is temporarily returning, thanks to this great success, to the height of Naples (6th place). Although their calendar for the last 11 tricks is tough, Rossonerri can believe in their opportunities to advance to the next C3. Even the Champions League, which they haven't seen since 2015.

The strike is the 18th league goal of the former Manchester United and Everton striker, thus becoming the seventh Inter player to reach the 18 goal-mark in a single Serie A campaign after Cameroon legend Samuel Eto’o, Mauro Icardi, Diego Milito, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Christian Vieri and Ronaldo.
 Moments after the half-hour mark, Lautaro Martinez then doubled the lead after benefitting from Antonio Candreva’s assist to take his tally to 12 league goals in this campaign.
 With Lukaku and Lautaro goals, Inter now have two players to score at least 12 goals in a single league season for the first time since the 2009-10 campaign when Eto’o and Milito achieved the feat.
 Victory in the encounter ensured Antonio Conte maintain their third-place on the league table with 57 points from 26 games.
 The Giuseppe Meazza outfit is behind Lazio and leaders Juventus, who are on 62 and 63 points respectively.
 Eto'o enjoyed success with the Black and Blues, where he spent two years after joining the side from Spanish giants Barcelona in 2009.

Crossville officials are prepared to refinance $26.5 million in debt to lower annual repayment amounts and steer clear of an increase in water rates.
 The mayor and three members of City Council voted Thursday for a 30-year bond issue that would allow the city to take advantage of record-low interest rates and reduce $2.4 million in total annual payments to $975,000.
 “If we borrow the money and spread it out over a longer period of time, that will do nothing but build up our cash flow,” council member J.H. Graham III said. “We’ll be a powerhouse in two years in the water and sewer department, therefore, not needing new rates in my estimation.”
 The Council discussed the matter during a Thursday work session with financial adviser Larry Kidwell, president of Kidwell and Co. Officials have been looking at refinancing the city’s debt for a number of months to free up cash and pay down the amount the city owes.
 “We have the lowest interest rates in history now,” Kidwell said. “Based on inflation projections that are official, it’s actually negative interest rates after you take into consideration inflation.”
 A special-called session was scheduled to precede the work session. Council members melded the two together, voting to recess the meeting prior to discussion and reconvening it afterward for the vote.
 The matter was not included on the agenda for the special-called meeting that preceded the work session. An email City Clerk Valerie Hale sent to the Chronicle Friday indicated the vote taken the preceding day is not the final decision.
 “There will be another vote on the Initial Resolution and Bond Resolution with the specific amounts,” she said via email, “and this probably won’t happen until August.”
 Mayor James Mayberry confirmed in email to the Chronicle Friday that he went into the meeting unaware that work session discussion would lead to action.
 “With my desire to settle the refinance issue, I should have made that discussion official, but I didn’t,” he wrote. “I learned that other council members were anxious to come to a decision on the financing, that day, therefore that’s how the decision to suspend the rules, with the super majority, happened.”
 He added, “There will be more discussion on the refinancing options and we really just gave our official financial advisor guidance to proceed with the direction we were looking to go before any decision to move forward is made.”
 Mayberry, Graham and council members Rob Harrison and Scot Shanks took part in both the special-called meeting and work session. Council member Art Gernt was not at the meeting.
 The debt up for refinancing on 30-year, fixed-rate bonds includes $15.258 million in water and sewer loans, $5.5 million for projects through the State Revolving Fund and $6 million in the city’s general fund. City officials also want to borrow $7 million for the water and sewer department for expected projects and $1 million for the general fund to pay for street lights with a sidewalk project.
 All together, the amount would be $34.5 million.
 “I’m thinking positive that we’ll be able to get those paid off to where they’re not included in our grandchildren’s debt down the road,” Mayberry said.
 The approved motion made by Shanks and seconded by Harrison was the second vote the council took. All voted in favor after Graham initially cast a “pass” vote.
 The first motion, made by Graham and seconded by Mayberry, omitted the SRF funds for a refinancing package of $29 million.
 “We got a 20-25% grant on those loans to begin with,” Graham said. “We’ve done pretty good with SRF money, and if we needed to talk to them about extending it, we could.”
 Graham made a motion to refinance all loans, with the exception of the SRF loans, and borrow $8 million total in new money on 30-year fixed-rate bonds.
 Graham pointed out that approval of the motion means relieving the city of $7 million in debt on variable interest rates, which would offset the SRF debt.
 “My concern is we go through this, and then we get into a situation three years from now where we have to raise rates,” Shanks said. “Is that going to cause us to have to do that? I think it’s a shame if that’s the case.”
 City Manager Greg Wood said he worries that continuing to pay off loans on variable interest rates could cost the city more in the long run, particularly if inflation or stagflation prompts those interest rates to increase.
 “That’s why we should go ahead and be financing as much as we can finance right now,” Shanks said. “And that’s what [Kidwell’s] recommendation is.”
 He added, “It just seems very simple. The route that he’s taking us down is simple.”
 Harrison said he could see both arguments, but he leaned slightly in Shanks’ favor “because of the simplicity of it, and the cash savings.”
 Thus the motion failed, with Graham and Mayberry voting in favor and Harrison and Shanks voting against.
 City Council will next meet June 29 to finalize the 2020-’21 city budget and property tax rate before forwarding them to the state. The meeting will start at 5 p.m. in Crossville City Hall.

Because of the Zoom Room tiles, Danny Bacher can see his audience watching, see when they are moved by what he is doing, see when they are clapping, and even watch them eating and drinking. The guests get to look at one another and see that their fellow patrons are enjoying the show, just as they would if they looked around Birdland to see if their neighboring tables were having a good time. MetropolitanZoom even provides virtual backgrounds for the guests, so their dwellings aren't seen on camera. This is the nightclub of this moment in time, the cabaret of quarantine, and it allows artists like Bacher to continue to work and fans to further their patronage of their favorites. While chatting with his audience, Bacher noted fans from cities across the nation, indeed, from other countries, something not possible in the previous cabaret and concert scene, but definitely in the works for the future. Further benefits to the format include not being bothered when guests are talking during the show because Furshpan has producers in the Zoom Room seeing to it that each guest's mic is muted and protecting the performance from technical glitches and in-the-moment surprises. Particularly special for this writer was watching guests who allowed themselves to really be in the moment - people like Martine Jaffe, who was a joy to behold as she and her date danced around the living room to Bacher's impeccable music-making, or Valerie Urde, a true champion who beat COVID-19, tuning in from her hospital bed, or Pamela Clay, who had SUCH a good time that she could not be contained - Ms. Clay is the Zoom Room audience member every artist wants at their virtual show, thoroughly heightening the happy experience.

During the hour and a half that Mr. Bacher played classics from The Great American Songbook like Shaking The Blues Away and Making Whoopee, or pop tunes like "Ev'rybody's Talkin'" and "Just the Way You Are" he was able to look at his monitor and see the 43 participants who tuned in to see him - some of the tiles showed his guests at home, others showed only the names of the patrons in their individual tiles. Whether the audience members chose to be visible or not didn't change Danny's ability to relate to them during the show because in between songs he could either communicate with them face to face, waving to nieces and nephews or just call out "I see Stephen Mosher is with us tonight! - even though Stephen Mosher opted to remain off-camera so he didn't have to fix his face or put on clothing, also, so he could take notes on his review without distracting the performer or his guests.

NORTH CHARLESTON — Approximately 445 U.S. Army National Guard Soldiers with the 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, South Carolina National Guard, demobilized June 12, 2020 at several locations across the state, including North Charleston, South Carolina, after completing their mission in the District of Columbia.
 Several units deployed to the nation's capital June 2 to support local law enforcement and the D.C. National Guard for a week, returning to South Carolina June 9. After returning to South Carolina, the Soldiers remained on orders to allow time to out-process and to conduct a COVID-19 test.
 The units included the 1-118th Infantry Battalion Headquarters and Headquarters Company, as well as companies A, B, C, D and I, the 4-118th Infantry Battalion rear detachment, and a detachment from the 1-134 Field Artillery Regiment.
 Several agencies from Charleston County assisted in the medical screening of 220 of the 445 demobilizing Soldiers in Charleston. Members from South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, Hanahan Fire Department, and medical personnel from the South Carolina Air and Army National Guard, conducted 220 COVID-19 tests in Charleston to evaluate the medical readiness of the returning Soldiers. The remaining Soldiers conducted the test at other locations in the state.
 The mission of the South Carolina National Guard in D.C. was to support the District of Columbia National Guard service members assisting local law enforcement with crowd control, general security, and patrols for continued public safety and critical infrastructure security, including national monuments.
 U.S. Army Capt. Brian Leister, Company A commander, said, “Our Soldiers performed exceptionally, deploying to D.C. in under 24 hours after getting the call.”
 Leister said that the deployed Soldiers represented the state of South Carolina, the National Guard, and the U.S. Army with professionalism and honor.
 U.S. Army 1st Sgt. Aaron Bittner, Company A first sergeant, added, the Soldiers maintained high morale with great discipline and remained professional while adapting to a tough situation.
 While in D.C., South Carolina National Guard Soldiers provided support for traffic control points and road closures, which allowed protesters to safely march through the streets and hold localized protests. Soldiers also provided security for protests to assist with maintaining citizen safety and to discourage violence. The South Carolina National Guard's presence was not intended to deter citizens from peacefully protesting, rather it was a means to help support an environment where citizens felt safe to exercise their rights and freedoms.
