CIUDAD DE MÉXICO (AP) — Siete personas fueron asesinadas en Reynosa, en la frontera con Texas, en un negocio de venta de bebidas alcohólicas, informó la fiscalía del estado de Tamaulipas. La dependencia indicó en un comunicado que el domingo hubo un reporte de detonaciones de arma de fuego y cuando la policía llegó al lugar se encontró con los siete cadáveres. Las autoridades indicaron que todavía se investigan los motivos del ataque. El estado fronterizo de Tamaulipas tiene una fuerte actividad del crimen organizado y en la ciudad de Reynosa tienen presencia distintos grupos que luchan por su control. El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador reconoció recientemente que la violencia en el país no ha disminuido por la incidencia del COVID-19 y afirmó que gran parte de ella se debía a crímenes entre bandas. Este fin de semana, en el estado fronterizo de Chihuahua, un fuerte enfrentamiento a tiros entre grupos rivales del narcotráfico dejó 19 muertos en el municipio de Madera. La fiscalía estatal señaló que policías y soldados fueron enviados a resguardar la seguridad en la zona, donde grupos aliados al Cártel de Sinaloa se enfrentan con los que están alineados con el Cártel de Juárez.

A group of religious IDF solders are bringing comfort to Jews in mourning by saying the obligatory "Kaddish" prayer on their behalf for deceased loved ones in a minyan.
 The soldiers serve with the Netzach Yehuda unit, a special battalion reserved for haredi soldiers who want to combine the rigors of religious Jewish practice with service in the Israeli army. Currently all soldiers are on lockdown on their bases, with no leave allowed while the pandemic measures are in effect. As the soldiers have been together for more than two weeks with no contact with anyone from outside the base, they have been permitted to hold minyanim - formal prayer quora consisting of at least ten men.
 In light of the coronavirus pandemic which is preventing others from forming minyanim across Israel and the diaspora, the soldiers have offered their services to anyone wanting Kiddish said for a loved one who has passed. They have been inviting people to send them names so that they can be remembered properly.
 Rabbi Shmuel Schwartz, a father of a paratrooper with the brigade said: "Over the last few weeks I have been lost because I cannot say Kaddish for my mother. Then my soul was immediately revitalized when my son offered to say Kaddish for my mother in his unit. I felt so relieved and at comfort that my mother could be properly honored during my time of mourning."
 THe initiative was launched and is being supported by Nahal Haredi, an organization which supports haredi soldiers serving in the IDF. The organisation has set up an online form for people around the world to place their requests for loved ones to be prayed for.
 The Nahal Haredi organization currently supports and accompanies 2,200 active duty soldiers, 300 lone soldiers and over 13,000 veterans.

Interior Minister Arye Deri said on Sunday morning that some ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods of Jerusalem have a higher coronavirus infection rate than Bnei Brak, the city with the highest rate in the country.
 Speaking in the Knesset Committee for Coronavirus, Deri, who is leading a government task force for dealing with the severe coronavirus outbreak in the ultra-Orthodox community, also expounded on efforts to deal with the epidemic in Bnei Brak itself, in particular the challenge of keeping the elderly population of the city isolated.
 "The majority of those ill with coronavirus in Jerusalem are in the ultra- Orthodox neighborhoods," said Deri.
 "In some of those neighborhoods which have a [high] concentration of infected people, the rate of infection is even higher than Bnei Brak.
 Deri declined however to say which neighborhoods specifically he was referring to.
 According to figures from early last week, the ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods of Jerusalem already had the largest outbreaks of the contagion.
 According to figures provided to the Jerusalem Municipal Council, the top five neighborhoods with the highest number of infected people were all ultra- Orthodox, including Har Nof with  44 cases, Bayit Ve'gan with 37, Geula with 34, Romema with 29 and Ramot with 19.
    As of Saturday, Jerusalem had 1,132 people who have tested positive for COVID-19 - approximately 0.12% of the population - while Bnei Brak has 1,061 people infected, representing 0.54% of that city's residents, a rate more than four times as much.
 The interior minister said that the Purim holiday had been a significant cause in spreading the virus around the ultra-Orthodox community because of the large gatherings which take place in synagogues and for festive meals where people often host large numbers of families.
 Deri insisted that the ultra-Orthodox community and its rabbis are now fully cooperating and on board with the social-distancing orders and other requirements to stop the spread of the coronavirus and deal with its impact, saying: "Lets not enter into what was and what wasn't."
 During the course of March, when restrictions were gradually increased by the government, the majority of the leadership of the ultra-Orthodox community was very reticent to comply with the social-distancing restrictions because of the limitations it put on religious life.
 Deri said that one of the biggest problems in Bnei Brak at present is in dealing with the elderly population, which is at high risk of infection, as well as serious complications from the disease and spreading it.
 The interior minister said that his task force had decided to leave the elderly at home and not move them to hotels outside of the city, following recommendations of the Health Ministry which said that one such person in a hotel could infect everyone else residing there.
 Instead, efforts are being made to provide the elderly and others in Bnei Brak who are in quarantine with everything they need so they do not need to leave their homes at all and thereby prevent further spread of the virus.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cancelled Monday's ministerial committee at which the government was expected to roll out restrictions on at least another eight cities and 15 neighborhoods and will instead place further restrictions on the whole country on Seder night, according to a report by Kann news.
 The move comes despite recommendations by the Health Ministry, according to Kann.
 Earlier in the day, Interior Minister Arye Deri told Channel 12 on Sunday that a full lockdown is being considered for Passover Eve and the first day of the Passover holiday.
 "We want everyone do the Seder night with the family that lives with them now, without movement of families," Deri said, a statement that was later reiterated by Prof. Itamar Grotto, Health Ministry deputy director-general.
 "There will be strong enforcement on this matter so that everyone stays with only their family," he said.
 Overnight, the government discussed putting restrictions similar to those that were placed on the haredi (ultra-Orthodox) city of Bnei Brak on the predominantly haredi cities of Elad, Beit Shemesh, the ultra-Orthodox settlement of Modi'in-Ilit, as well as Ashkelon, Tiberias, Beitar-Ilit, Or Yehuda, and Migdal HaEmek.
 The government committee was expected to approve the closures and tightening of traffic restrictions Monday, restrictions that would have looked similar to those that are currently on the haredi city of Bnei Brak.
 Overnight, the committee also defined as a restricted zone certain areas of Judea and Samaria. The ministers additionally approved the enlargement of the fund for economic aid to civilians in light of the crisis, which will be presented for the Knesset's approval on Monday.
 The increased budget will be achieved if an amendment to a Basic Law of the state is approved. According to the amendment, National Insurance debt will be enlarged by NIS 16 billion on top of the already-existing NIS 40 billion in national debt that exists due to the coronavirus crisis.

Three of the four golf majors have announced new dates for 2020 amid the coronavirus crisis while the oldest of the lot, the British Open confirmed it would cancel its event for the year.
 Tiger Woods will defend his green jacket at the Masters Tournament in November at the conclusion of a radically altered schedule in light of the global pandemic.
 The PGA Championship, postponed from May, will kick-off the new-look major season August 6-9 at Harding Park, San Francisco, filling a date made available by the postponement of the Tokyo Olympic Games.
 And the US Open, the last major to announce a change amid the coronavirus crisis, moves from June to September 17-20 at Winged Foot Golf Club in New York.
 That will also act as the tune-up event for the biennial Ryder Cup where team Europe will defend the trophy against the US at Whistling Straits, Wisconsin, on unchanged dates September 25-28.
 The Masters will then be the last, rather than first, major of the year November 12-15 at Augusta National Golf Club.
 The revised dates for the three US-based majors were announced shortly after the 2020 Open Championship was cancelled completely.
 The 149th edition of golf's oldest major will be held at Royal St George's in July next year, the governing R&A; said.
 The decision was made on guidance from the UK Government, the health authorities, public services and advisors.
 It is the first time since World War II that the Open, first played in 1860, has been cancelled.
 "Obviously I'm disappointed that I won't get to defend the Open Championship this year but I feel the R&A; have made the right decisions based on people's health and safety," title-holder Shane Lowry tweeted.
 There has been an immediate knock-on effect to the Open rota with the 150th Championship now being held at the St Andrews Old Course in 2022 rather than 2021.
 "Our absolute priority is to protect the health and safety of the fans, players, officials, volunteers and staff involved in The Open," said R&A; chief executive Martin Slumbers.
 The cancellation of the Open follows that of Wimbledon.
 Only the Formula One British Grand Prix remains in place on the British sporting calendar for the summer, on July 19, with a decision on whether it can take place expected by the end of the month.
 And football across the United Kingdom is suspended until at least May with debate ongoing about whether it is possible to conclude the current season.

The first shipment carrying millions of eggs arrived at Ashdod Port on Sunday, after the government worked to import millions of eggs from Spain after Israel was hit by a nationwide egg shortage.
 The second ship is expected to arrive on Tuesday. Government agencies prepared trucks and logistics centers in order to bring the eggs to stores starting on Sunday.
 The ships were diverted in order to import the eggs, sailing faster than usual and skipping ports along the way.
 Work at the Ashdod Port has only intensified since the coronavirus outbreak began as air shipments have become more scarce. The employees work while following Health Ministry guidelines and wearing protective gear.
 "The Ashdod Port continues to be the central lifeline for the entry of goods into the State of Israel," said Ashdod Port chairwoman Orna Hozman Bechor. "Our professional and logistical system works around the clock so that we can continue and provide all the needs of the economy, and we even enhanced it to provide service in urgent cases like today, when we are experiencing a severe egg deficiency [on] Passover eve.
 "I want to note the commendable dedication of the port staff, who demonstrate strength and are dedicated to continuing and securing full operations of the port as an economic and strategic lifeline for the State of Israel," added Bechor.
 The Prime Minister's Office announced on Friday that the government will subsidize the import of millions of eggs to ensure that no shortage will be experienced as the nation gears up for the Passover holiday, which starts Wednesday evening.
 Demand typically surges 20% ahead of the seven-day-long holiday. This year, against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, the clamor for eggs has reached a boiling point as shoppers have stripped supermarket shelves bare.
 To ensure the eggs arrive prior to Passover and compete with increasing demand in other countries, the Agriculture and Finance ministries said they have taken the exceptional move to persuade shipping companies to change their routes, enabling both greater and faster imports.

Labor will soon merge its faction and then the party itself with Blue and White, Labor leader Amir Peretz revealed at a meeting of the Knesset Arrangements Committee on Monday, in a move that could result in the former ruling party whose forerunner Mapai founded the state no longer continuing to exist.
 The merger would allow the Blue and White faction to include 20 MKs, including the 15 from Blue and White leader Benny Gantz's Israel Resilience Party, two from the Derech Eretz Party of MKs Tzvi Hauser and Yoaz Hendel and three from Labor.
 Gantz and Peretz met on Monday and decided to engage in a dialogue aimed at formalizing collaboration between their two factions and parties, Blue and White and Labor said in an official statement.
 In the first stage, the rules for collaboration and coordination within the Knesset will be determined, with the intention of ultimately uniting the factions. Moving forward, teams will be formed to foster political cooperation and to prepare for future election campaigns. The two decided that Blue and White faction chairman Avi Nissenkorn and Labor MK Itzik Shmuli will work together to advance these issues.
 Labor MK Merav Michaeli, who opposes entering the coalition, said she was shocked to hear in a Knesset press statement that her party and the party of former prime ministers  would soon no longer exist, due to the desire of Peretz to enter what she said would be a corrupt government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She called upon Labor members to fight for the life of their party.
 "To give portfolios to Amir Peretz and Itzik Shmuli, you don't throw away the party of David Ben-Gurion, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres," Michaeli said.
 Peretz formally requested a split from Meretz from the Arrangements Committee. He said the parties differed about how to be most effective on socioeconomic issues during the financial crisis caused by the coronavirus. The split was approved by the committee with no opposition.
 "We didn't see eye to eye about how to serve the public," Peretz said. "We in Labor wanted to explore the possibility of serving the people from the government."
 Meretz MK Tamar Zandberg bashed Peretz at the meeting.
 "We didn't even entertain the thought that having no ballot that said Meretz in the last election would result in our votes being used to crawl into a corrupt government,"  she said.

 Rupert Hoogewerf's eponymous Hurun Research released a special report on Monday revealing changes to wealth rankings of the world's wealthiest entrepreneurs who make the Hurun Global Top 100 list in the two months ending on March 31.      The report findings show that China added six individuals to the top 100 billionaires list, the biggest addition during the period, while India lost three and the US lost two.      Meanwhile, in signs that global businesses are taking a battering from the COVID-19 pandemic, the world's top 100 billionaires lost 12.6 percent, or $408 billion, in the two months, suggesting all gains made in the past two and a half years have been erased. More importantly, only 9 percent of those making the Hurun list saw their wealth increase, which are all from China.      The latest rankings largely mirror the nation's effectiveness in having certain businesses meet the daily necessities of average folks despite a lockdown, a feat admirable but hardly imitable by other virus-plagued economies, observers said.  
 The nine seeing wealth additions are all from China, including bosses at hog producer Muyuan, feed and meet producer New Hope, soy sauce maker Haitian, JD.com Inc, SF Express, Xiaomi, and ventilator and life support medical equipment maker Mindray.      Stating that the viral pandemic has had too much impact on businesses and wealth, Zhang Yansheng, chief researcher at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, believes such wealth changes are still part of expectations, as the industries that stay intact from the disease or even turn out to be winners of the pandemic - such as medical equipment - might have been operating at full throttle.      A deeper look into the industries unravels the mysteries of how they buck an overall lackluster trend. Take Mindray. It's understandable that the company has performed well, as there's a massive need, unfortunately, for its products, Hoogewerf told the Global Times on Monday.      He was uncertain about whether the gains would be sustainable though. The sustainability of the gains "depends on how stock markets perform relatively. I would have assumed that the US and some European stock markets would bounce back, but I'm not sure if that's going to be in one month or six months or two years or whatever."

Trump came under fire for not responding more forcefully to violence provoked by some neo-Nazi groups in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 and has been called out for supporting European nationalist politicians.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been avoiding any place where groups gather, ranging from restaurants to churches to gyms and fitness studios. Most businesses, including The Core Connection, have temporarily closed.
 These precautions are necessary, but unfortunate, as exercise can strengthen a person's immune system. It also reduces stress, which is important during these stress-inducing times.
 Strengthen your immune system
 While not much is known yet about fighting COVID-19, we do know that exercise has been helpful during previous flu epidemics.
 A study performed on 24,656 Chinese adults who died during the 1998 Hong Kong flu outbreak showed that mild to moderate exercise reduced the risk of dying. Other studies performed on mice demonstrated that regular exercise two to three months before an infection reduced the severity of the illness.
 While it's not clear why or how exercise increases your immunity to certain illnesses, there are several theories. According to Medlineplus, physical activity may help flush bacteria out of the lungs and airways, reducing the probability that you will catch a cold or flu, including COVID-19.
 In addition, exercise changes antibodies and white blood cells, which are the cells in the immune system that fight disease. When you exercise, these antibodies and white blood cells circulate in your body more rapidly, so they can potentially detect and fight illnesses earlier than they might have if you didn't exercise.
 In addition, our body temperature rises during exercise and stays elevated briefly afterward, which may prevent bacteria from growing and help the body fight infection.
 And, finally, exercise slows down the release of stress hormones, which also may protect you against illness. Stress weakens our immune systems and exercise reduces stress.
 "Stress hormones, which can suppress immune cell function, and proinflammatory cytokines, indicative of intense metabolic activity, do not reach high levels during short duration, moderate exercise bouts," according to the Journal of Sport and Health Science. "Over time, these transient, exercise-induced increases in selective lymphocyte subsets enhance immunosurveillance and lower inflammation, and may be of particular clinical value for obese and diseased individuals."
 Try this at home
 Being stuck at home is not an excuse for avoiding exercise.
 While your gym may be closed, many gyms are offering online classes, including The Core Connection. You can visit our website (thecoreconnection.com) to sign up or check out our YouTube channel for free recorded workouts.
 You can also develop your own workout, based on the equipment you have available and your individual needs and ability. During a previous column, we suggested a number of exercises that can be performed with little or no equipment and that certainly comes in handy in times like these.
 Push-ups, burpees, squats, lunges, jumping jacks, planks and many other exercises can be performed without equipment. Walking, for example, is one of the best exercises available and accessible to everyone and that comes with getting out in nature and breathing fresh air for extra added benefits. Consider varying your movement and your mileage to keep things engaging.
 Even though many retailers are closed, you can purchase yoga blocks, resistance bands, foam rollers and other equipment online. And there is always the option to incorporate items from home like canned goods and laundry detergent and using them in exercises such as lunges, bicep curls, dead lifts and rows.
 Be sure to warm up at the beginning or your workout and stretch at the end of your workout. In between, try to exercise every muscle group and keep up a pace that continues to challenge you.
 After the pandemic
 If you were working out before the COVID-19 pandemic, working out at home will make it easier for you to resume your exercise routine once the "shelter at home" period ends.
 If you haven't been working out, starting now will give you something positive to do while you're stuck at home. Hopefully, you'll continue working out when fitness centers reopen.
 This is a good time to develop good habits that you can continue even after the pandemic ends. After all, most people have more time on their hands than they had before COVID-19. In addition to continuing to exercise, hopefully you'll continue to follow the best hygiene practices that you established during the pandemic.
 Wash your hands often and be sure to wipe down the equipment you're using both before and after you work out. Doing so will help you and others stay health, which is important even when there's no coronavirus to worry about.
 One benefit of the Covid-19 pandemic is that it has made us all more aware of infection. Washing your hands thoroughly and regularly, and cleaning equipment can help you avoid illness at any time of year.

The response from the majority of the white community was appalling, to say the least. They were outraged that we dared to say that they must acknowledge guilt, and even more angry at our call that they should voluntarily pay reparations. We were vilified, and called all kinds of names, from ‘weaklings’, ‘sorry excuses for being whites’, and mocked as the ‘sorry sorries’.

The Likud and Blue and White are expected to finalize their agreement on a new government on Monday night after significant progress was made when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White chairman Benny Gantz met at Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence on Monday.
 The deal reportedly was made possible after Gantz compromised on how and when to implement US President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan and Netanyahu compromised on controlling the selection committee for new judges.
 Already in July, Netanyahu will be able to bring the plan to the cabinet for a vote. Netanyahu will have to consult with Gantz and Trump on the plan but Gantz will not have veto power on the plan. Gantz also gave up on his demand to coordinate the plan with the king of Jordan.  
 In a joint statement, Likud and Blue and White said negotiations were currently underway and were being carried out in a positive and constructive manner toward forming a government as quickly as possible. For instance, both sides agreed to maintain status quo on matters of religion and state and make changes that Shas requested to the controversial haredi (ultra-Orthodox) draft bill.
 Earlier, Gantz, who is also Knesset speaker, warned Netanyahu that if he would not make concessions leading to the signing of an agreement by Monday afternoon he would enable the advancement of anti-Netanyahu legislation.
 The legislation includes bills that would limit a prime minister to two terms in office and prevent an indicted MK from forming the government.
 Likud faction chairman Miki Zohar called Gantz's threat "Mafia tactics" and said Netanyahu would not surrender to him.
 "Benny, this is not how you create unity," Zohar said. "This is how you incite and divide."
 Yesh Atid-Telem MK Moshe Ya'alon, Gantz's former partner in Blue and White's leadership cockpit, praised the threat, saying that "it is still not too late to reverse a mistake in navigation."
 Blue and White MK Chili Tropper, who is close to Gantz, said his party would not compromise on the authority of the justice minister, who is expected to be Blue and White faction chairman Avi Nissenkorn. Blue and White officials reiterated that they also would not give in on former Knesset speaker Yuli Edelstein not returning to his post.
 Yamina leader Naftali Bennett told Army Radio on Monday morning that there was no guarantee he would join the government and it would depend on what his party is offered by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 "We will look at the government and see its policies," he said. "If we see it as a bus going the wrong way, we won't get on the bus. The ball is in his court."

So far no agreement is in the offing. Instead, the eurozone finance ministers will discuss a three-pillar aid package Tuesday, according to Mario Centeno, the Portuguese official who chairs eurozone finance meetings. That includes up to 240 billion euros ($264 billion) in loans from the eurozone's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism; short-term credit to keep companies afloat; and a scheme to help companies avoid firing people. The EU has also suspended limits on government deficits and anti-trust rules against governments supporting their own companies - unprecedented steps for the bloc.
