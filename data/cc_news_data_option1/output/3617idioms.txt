Mookie Betts is already one of the best players in the big leagues and a front-runner for NL MVP at season's end. Now he's also a Dodgers second baseman. The 27-year-old made his first start at the position since 2014 on Thursday night against the Diamondbacks. Betts isn't a total stranger to second, playing there in the minors and starting 14 games at the position during his rookie season with the Red Sox. Los Angeles manager Dave Roberts said he wants to make sure the roster is as flexible as possible for the postseason and that Betts was excited about the opportunity.

“CDC urgently requests your assistance in expediting applications for these distribution facilities and, if necessary, asks that you consider waiving requirements that would prevent these facilities from becoming fully operational by November 1, 2020,” Redfield wrote.
 He wrote that any waivers will not compromise the safety or effectiveness of the vaccine. The Associated Press obtained the letter, which was first reported by McClatchy.
 The CDC also sent three planning documents to some health departments that included possible timelines for when vaccines would be available. The documents are to be used to develop plans for early vaccination when the supply might be constrained, according to one of the documents, which outlined a scenario in which a vaccine could be available as soon as the end of October.
 “The COVID-19 vaccine landscape is evolving and uncertain, and these scenarios may evolve as more information is available,” the document reads.
 Another of the documents says that limited COVID-19 vaccine doses may be available by early November and that supply will increase substantially in 2021.
 It also states that initially available vaccines will either be approved by the Food and Drug Administration or authorized by the agency under its emergency powers.
 The documents encourage health officials to work out now which groups to prioritize for a vaccine, identify providers who will administer vaccine, and take other steps to prepare. The planning documents were first reported by The New York Times.
 Redfield told Yahoo Finance that officials were preparing “for what I anticipate will be reality, is that there’ll be one or more vaccines available for us in November, December.”
 James S. Blumenstock, a senior vice president at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the CDC was offering “an aggressive but necessary timetable” and that public health agencies were mobilizing to prepare detailed plans.
 Several public health experts pointed out that final stage trials of experimental vaccines are still recruiting, and are at best halfway through that process. The vaccines are two doses, and each is given a month apart. The experts told the AP they did not understand how there could be adequate data on whether the vaccines work and are safe before Nov. 1.
 On Tuesday, the top executives of nine drugmakers likely to produce the first vaccines against the new coronavirus signed an unprecedented pledge meant to boost public confidence in any approved vaccines. They have committed to stick to the highest ethical and scientific standards in testing and manufacturing and will make the well-being of those getting vaccinated their top priority.
 The announcement comes amid worries that President Donald Trump will pressure the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve a vaccine before it’s proven to be safe and effective.
 “Being ready is reasonable. Cutting short phase 3 trials before you get the information you need isn’t,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia immunization expert who sits on the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee.
 Peter Hotez, dean of Baylor University’s tropical medicine school, said he was “very concerned” about whether the FDA would use an emergency use authorization to approve a vaccine before knowing whether it works and is safe.
 “It gives the appearance of a stunt rather than an expression of public health concern,” Hotez said.
 FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn previously said the agency wouldn’t cut corners in evaluating vaccines, though it would aim to expedite its work. He recently told the Financial Times that it might be “appropriate” to approve a vaccine before clinical trials were complete if the benefits outweighed the risks.
 Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert, said he was concerned about an “October surprise” with a vaccine being rushed through ahead of the election.
 “The public health community wants a safe and effective vaccine as much as anybody could want it,” Osterholm said. “But the data have to be clear and compelling.”
 He said there was a “credibility gap” between doctors and the FDA about how rigorously products are being evaluated during the pandemic.
 Some state officials said Wednesday that they were working on next steps while still awaiting details from CDC, and some sounded a cautious note.
 Kris Ehresmann, Minnesota’s infectious disease director, told the AP the state would only move forward “once we know it is safe.” She said they would take their lead from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which she said “will only recommend a vaccine that has met the safety criteria.”
 The Oregon Board of Pharmacy said it would expedite McKesson’s applications but wouldn’t waive requirements necessary to maintain public health and safety.
 The office of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said state officials don’t know yet what is being asked of them, and will first need to do “an extensive review of the potential benefits or pitfalls of such waivers.”

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - As soon as catching wind of possible exposure to COVID, a person’s immediate reaction might be to run to the nearest testing site. However, some experts say a negative test result might be inaccurate.Dr. Eric Yazel with the Floyd County Health Department says a person should wait five days after possibly being exposed to get tested for the coronavirus.A person gets tested for the coronavirus at a drive-thru testing site in Louisville“That’s one thing that we talked about a lot when this all started,” Yazel said. “There’s about a 30% false-negative rate there and I think that’s kind of fallen by the wayside and everything. We do need to still remember that, especially if you are going to do high-risk things.”Yazel says people should ask about turnaround times on test results before making an appointment. Some labs can take up to two weeks, while others can get results in a day or two.Rapid testing that’s in the works can get results even quicker, like a strep test. However, the FDA warns up to half of those tests could come back with a false negative.While some are still questioning the accuracy of COVID-19 tests, Yazel says they will be a serious asset.“That’s kind of a game-changer when you have a worrisome situation, you can have results back in hours instead of days,” Yazel said.Medical experts also recommend getting a flu shot this year, so it will be easier to determine whether a patient is fighting the flu or COVID.Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News.

_Francesca has to use a wheelchair to get around now_
 This week the government acknowledged that some people who have experienced both mild and severe coronavirus symptoms can experience long-term health effects - like Francesca Locastro who still cannot walk unaided five months on.
 She was struck down with a fever, cough and shortness of breath in April, after having chillblains on her fingers for four weeks - which are now also thought to be a symptom of Covid-19.
 “I thought in a week or two I’ll get better,” said Francesca, a policy advisor at consumer organisation Which.
 But the breathlessness got worse and she was bed ridden for six weeks and rushed to A&E twice.
 By the third week she was experiencing migraines “like never before”, along with conjunctivitis, insomnia and photosensitivity, and was diagnosed with lung inflammation.
 “Doctors told me they were aware of patients taking time to recover, and told me to rest and take it easy,” said Francesca.
 But by the sixth week she had a “major relapse” and “felt the worst she had through the whole thing”.
 “I started wheezing and gasping for air and had a tingling sensation in my head. I couldn’t keep my eyes open because it was too much,” she said.
 But like many coronavirus patients, some professionals were sceptical the illness could last so long, and she was prescribed anti-depressants by one doctor.
 “I was shaking I wasn’t able to stand still,” she said. “That was very scary. I was worried and I was telling him I was previously active and healthy, and explaining I wanted to get back to normal - but all of a sudden I would get a cough and not be able to breathe or keep my eyes open.
 Eventually she came across a Long Covid group online, which has been a relief.
 Discovering others were experiencing similar ongoing neurological symptoms was reassuring.
 “When we have received care we have had to really fight for it. When you are so unwell you can’t be chasing doctors and health care providers,” she said.
 Public Health England finally conceded this week that about 10 per cent of patients with coronavirus who were not admitted to hospital have symptoms lasting more than four weeks.
 An estimated 60,000 people have been affected.
 Symptoms are diverse and range from respiratory problems, cardiovascular symptoms like chest tightness and heart failure, and inflammatory disorders, to mental health problems and liver and kidney disfunction.
 Francesca is still plagued with headaches, extreme fatigue, weakness, and still cannot walk.
 She has been given respiratory exercises to aid her recovery and has to make adjustments to help manage the symptoms - like resting before a half-hour chat with this paper.
 Because of the lack of available tests in the UK when the disease first broke out, Francesca didn’t ever test positive for coronavirus - although medics, and thankfully her employer, do now believe she had it.
 When she first went to A&E no tests were being done, and by the time home tests were available, she ran into trouble. The first kit wasn’t ever delivered, the second one wasn’t collected, and the third result was unclear. Two swab tests carried out in June, three months in, came back negative for coronavirus antibodies.
 “The testing strategy has been a huge mess.
 “I had a terrible experience using home kits and I wish swab tests were done by professionals and the burden wasn’t on ill people to sort out everything and administer the test as well.
 “When I finally had the test in A&E I was struggling with how deep they had to go into the nasal passage. It’s uncomfortable and it’s hard to do that yourself.”
 Francesca is grateful her employer is understanding and she can work reduced hours.
 “In my case it hasn’t been problematic because my employer believes it’s Covid but I know that many other employers aren’t like that and they will ask you to return to work if you can’t prove you’ve had the illness,” she said.
 She feels uncertain about the future.
 “I’ve had to adjust my expectations about recovery several times. “It’s not just being tired. I sleep and need an hour when I wake up to get out of bed because I can’t even move.
 “Now it’s five months and it could go on a year or maybe longer.”

Former Bank of Melbourne manager Andi Lee stole $4.2 million from customers using fake term deposit accounts between 2015 and 2019. “The more admiration you received from others the more you became caught up in the lifestyle you had adopted,” Victorian County Court Judge Frances Hogan said on Friday. The 39-year-old lived a “shallow life” with the consuming desire to appear successful to those around him, she said. Lee used fake term deposits to scam customers into thinking they were investing safely but instead funnelled the cash into accounts he and associates controlled, including his ex-wife and sister. He put some money back into the clients’ accounts to trick them into believing their money was accruing interest. But the stolen cash went on two Porsches worth almost $300,000 - he kept one for himself and gave the other to his girlfriend - while another $377,000 was used to buy 26 “rare” luxury watches that helped to enhance Lee’s image with those around him. Lee later told a mental health professional he was glad the truth came out. “I don’t care if I lose everything,” he said. His lawyers told the court he was remorseful, had pleaded guilty early and his disadvantaged background in part motivated his crimes. It was a “spectacular fall from grace” for the former bank manager who had started volunteering for Ronald McDonald House, Judge Hogan said. “You were driven by an insatiable need to look successful and appear to be wealthy,” the judge said. The disgraced bank manager pleaded guilty to three counts of obtaining financial advantage by deception.He was jailed for seven years and eight months but will be eligible for parole after serving three years and ten months.

This week the government acknowledged that some people who have experienced both mild and severe coronavirus symptoms can experience long-term health effects - like Francesca Locastro who still cannot walk unaided five months on. She was struck down with a fever, cough and shortness of breath in April, after having chillblains on her fingers for four weeks - which are now also thought to be a symptom of Covid-19. "I thought in a week or two I'll get better," said Francesca, a policy advisor at consumer organisation Which. But the breathlessness got worse and she was bed ridden for six weeks and rushed to A&E twice. By the third week she was experiencing migraines "like never before", along with conjunctivitis, insomnia and photosensitivity, and was diagnosed with lung inflammation. "Doctors told me they were aware of patients taking time to recover, and told me to rest and take it easy," said Francesca. But by the sixth week she had a "major relapse" and "felt the worst she had through the whole thing". "I started wheezing and gasping for air and had a tingling sensation in my head. I couldn't keep my eyes open because it was too much," she said. But like many coronavirus patients, some professionals were sceptical the illness could last so long, and she was prescribed anti-depressants by one doctor. "I was shaking I wasn't able to stand still," she said. "That was very scary. I was worried and I was telling him I was previously active and healthy, and explaining I wanted to get back to normal - but all of a sudden I would get a cough and not be able to breathe or keep my eyes open. Eventually she came across a Long Covid group online, which has been a relief. Discovering others were experiencing similar ongoing neurological symptoms was reassuring. "When we have received care we have had to really fight for it. When you are so unwell you can't be chasing doctors and health care providers," she said. Public Health England finally conceded this week that about 10 per cent of patients with coronavirus who were not admitted to hospital have symptoms lasting more than four weeks. An estimated 60,000 people have been affected. Symptoms are diverse and range from respiratory problems, cardiovascular symptoms like chest tightness and heart failure, and inflammatory disorders, to mental health problems and liver and kidney disfunction. Francesca is still plagued with headaches, extreme fatigue, weakness, and still cannot walk. She has been given respiratory exercises to aid her recovery and has to make adjustments to help manage the symptoms - like resting before a half-hour chat with this paper. Because of the lack of available tests in the UK when the disease first broke out, Francesca didn't ever test positive for coronavirus - although medics, and thankfully her employer, do now believe she had it. When she first went to A&E no tests were being done, and by the time home tests were available, she ran into trouble. The first kit wasn't ever delivered, the second one wasn't collected, and the third result was unclear. Two swab tests carried out in June, three months in, came back negative for coronavirus antibodies. "The testing strategy has been a huge mess. "I had a terrible experience using home kits and I wish swab tests were done by professionals and the burden wasn't on ill people to sort out everything and administer the test as well. "When I finally had the test in A&E I was struggling with how deep they had to go into the nasal passage. It's uncomfortable and it's hard to do that yourself." Francesca is grateful her employer is understanding and she can work reduced hours. "In my case it hasn't been problematic because my employer believes it's Covid but I know that many other employers aren't like that and they will ask you to return to work if you can't prove you've had the illness," she said. She feels uncertain about the future. "I've had to adjust my expectations about recovery several times. "It's not just being tired. I sleep and need an hour when I wake up to get out of bed because I can't even move. "Now it's five months and it could go on a year or maybe longer."

Many critics have observed that demands for religious liberty do not extend to all religions, which prevents fair treatment. Others have noted that greater protections might harm women and LGBT Americans.
 I recognize the merits of these critiques. However, largely absent from them is an equally powerful argument made over a century ago. Back then, some evangelical Christians argued that demands for government protection for Christianity signaled that their religion had failed.
 My research shows the late 19th century was a bad time for American Protestants. Agnosticism and atheism became popular, especially among younger intellectuals. Rising numbers of non-Protestant immigrants brought greater religious diversity.
 These changes caused Protestants to lose the privileges they had enjoyed in public life, such as their control over many of the nation’s academic institutions. In one notable example, the school board in Cincinnati, Ohio, prohibited Bible reading in public schools. Catholics had objected that schools used a Protestant translation of scripture and officials agreed.
 Fearing similar cases, devout Protestants turned to the federal government. They supported an amendment first proposed during the Civil War that would have placed the language of evangelical Protestantism in the Constitution.
 The amendment sought to include references to God and Jesus in the Constitution. It also declared the Bible “the supreme rule for the conduct of nations.” This final point was at odds with Catholic teaching. It made clear that the amendment was intended to placate only Protestants.
 Supporters of the amendment had friends in high places. William Strong, a justice on the Supreme Court, led a group advocating its passage.
 Much like Jeff Sessions, Strong urged protection for Christianity in the public sphere. The future of the religion was at stake. The justice warned that the Constitution must be made “explicitly Christian.” Otherwise, Christianity – specifically evangelical Protestantism – would be “obliterated” from the nation.
 But other Protestants disagreed.
 Among them was Washington Gladden. He was a minister who had grown up in a very devout family. Though he would become a leading religious liberal, Gladden was well within the mainstream of American Protestantism at the height of debates about the constitutional amendment.
 In the 1870s, Gladden had great influence as religious editor of the New York Independent, one of the most read U.S. periodicals of the day. The paper had strong religious credentials. It proclaimed that in all its coverage it was “bound to the evangelical faith by the firm belief of its editors.”
 That belief, however, did not include endorsing government support of Protestantism. In his editorials, Gladden railed against the proposed amendment. The state was “not called to the inculcation or confirmation of religious truth,” he wrote.
 Gladden invoked religious liberty – the same rhetoric President Trump and members of his administration have used to reassure modern evangelicals – to demand no special protection be made. Citizens should expect “equal footing for their faith, no matter what it may be,” rather than particular privilege.
 Most boldly, Gladden argued that a religion that needed protection from government was a religion that had no reason to exist. He wrote on his editorial page,
 “If our Christianity is of such a flimsy texture that nothing but a constitutional amendment will save it, the sooner it is obliterated the better for the land.”
 Simply put, he insisted, religious people had to make their own case for their values. If they could not, they certainly did not deserve greater support. This was a controversial argument in what was largely a Protestant country, but other Protestants amplified it. Other Christian leaders came to see support for the amendment as a sign of weak faith.
 Despite the backing of powerful men like William Strong, the Christian amendment failed. The nation’s Protestant leaders never came together in support of it.
 While the religious critique was not the sole cause the amendment’s failure, Gladden’s line of argument was powerful. It shamed the amendment’s supporters by arguing that their demands were antithetical not only to American values but to Christian ones as well. Demands for government support only confirmed evangelical Christianity’s impotence.
 History suggests it is a rhetorical strategy that critics of the Trump administration’s religious liberty policies might do well to revisit.

Jean, in an Instagram post welcoming the events, called on brands ‘’that have committed the most notable international missteps’’ to join the event.
 “Italian Fashion shall no longer hide behind excuses and justifications that point the conversation to other countries,’’ Jean said. “We are not asking for a seat at the table. It is past time for change.’’
 Fashion houses including Prada, Gucci, Dolce&Gabbana and Marni have all had to apologize for racially-charged gaffes over recent seasons. Jean and other contend that such gaffes are only indicative of the lack of diversity behind the scenes in Italian fashion.
 On the schedule announced Thursday, Fendi, Versace and Ferragamo will be among 23 fashion houses holding physical runway shows during fashion week, while 41 others, including Prada and Giorgio Armani, have opted instead to maintain a digital presence due to coronavirus concerns. Events will be streamed on the council’s website, as well as on mega-screens set up in key Milan locations.
 Valentino, which is based in Rome but normally shows in Paris, announced it will show its co-ed collection in Milan due to travel restrictions related to the virus.
 Council president Carlo Capasa said during a streamed presentation that journalists and buyers from Europe have already indicated plans to travel to Milan for the events, which also include showrooms that are critical for selling the collections around the world.
