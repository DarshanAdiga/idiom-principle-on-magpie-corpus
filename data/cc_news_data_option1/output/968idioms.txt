But many of the more prominent players remain split on the issue, some of them totally adamant about declining the proposal and returning back to the drawing board to look for more revenue concessions. Those players are, seemingly, the vocal minority. Because while there are surely many reasons to take objection to the proposal, many of the league's marginal players will benefit greatly from the upcoming changes included in the document. And those are the kinds of amenities that may push this CBA through the voting process — even after the players have an additional two days to stew over their votes.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that complete trust is lacking between China’s two main rivals in the Indo-Pacific. India is afraid of falling under the influence of the West, while the West comes across as a partner who is concerned only with its own interests. Distrust hinders the development of military and political cooperation between PRC’s rivals, and China, in the meantime, continues to grow more powerful, and it is even becoming difficult for the United States to compete with this leading player by itself.

It is difficult to say what effect all of this will have on the development of the Australia-India relations. The West is well known for its pragmatism and often chooses to turn a blind eye to controversial behaviour of its partners if cooperation with them is truly beneficial. The presence of China in Asia Pacific is becoming increasingly noticeable, thus Australia as well as other Western nations will just have to accept India’s domestic policies for the sake of their own security and to preserve the usual order in the APAC. Many Australian politicians have been expressing their enthusiasm about the future of their nation’s relationship with India. Still, in January 2020, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison chose not to attend the Raisina Dialogue conference.
