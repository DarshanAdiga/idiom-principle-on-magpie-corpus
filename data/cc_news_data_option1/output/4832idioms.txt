From the jury, "The play touches on questions of faith, sexuality, friendship, and solidarity with an abundance of heart and humour. Rachel Mutombo's dialogue is real and refreshing; her characters feel true and alive, with all the kindness and cruelty of teenagers as the four girls try to navigate between the expectations of their religion, their community and the more liberal values of their adopted home, Québec. This play makes one both tear up and laugh out loud, sometimes on the same page. One of the most exciting, original voices to come out of Canadian theatre in many years."

Local restaurants expect a significant dip in business with the state's restrictions on alcohol sales Wednesday.
 Gov. Tom Wolf and Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine announced Monday a ban on the sale of alcohol at bars and restaurants after 5 p.m. Wednesday to reduce gatherings the night before Thanksgiving.
 Joe Mattera, owner of The Brickhouse Grill in Orwigsburg, said for restaurants, this night is usually the beginning of the holiday season and increased business.
 "This will have a detrimental impact on our sales," Mattera said. "Are people still going to come out if they know they can't have a glass of beer or wine or a cocktail with their meal? I don't know."
 Mattera said on top of the reduced capacity in restaurants, the alcohol restriction is another blow to business.
 "We can only operate at a capacity that does not allow us to turn a profit," Mattera said. "You can't sell half of your product. They may as well shut us down."
 John Challenger, co-owner of The Crimson House in Pottsville, said the restrictions will be "devastating."
 "Normally this is one of our big, profitable nights," Challenger said. "We're putting our heads together now. We're really trying to push different kinds of food to sell."
 Challenger said the restaurant, which has been expanding, just opened the middle section for indoor dining, so he hopes that will still attract business.
 "We're finally able to move inside, and then the governor announces this," Challenger said.
 Robert Massari Jr., owner of the Blu Tavern Restaurant near Minersville, said this specific restriction may not have a major impact on his business, as the restaurant's bar has already been closed.
 In July, Wolf ordered that all indoor restaurant service must be at a table or booth and prohibited bar service.
 Massari said closing the bar has harmed business because of lost customers who would sit at the bar and order food along with beverages.
 "The bar is basically an extension of our dining room," Massari said. "Normally the bar would do the same amount of sales as the dining room."
 Massari said he understands the need to restrict bigger establishments and cities, but he thinks the new restriction will unfairly harm many small businesses.
 "I get what they're trying to avoid," Massari said. "A night club is a different story. They're not being fair to everybody."

The opioid crisis in Canada has resulted in many thousands of deaths over the past decade. Personally, this crisis has affected me from the people I've known who have fallen into this dark well of addiction. We all know people in all of our communities across Canada that have either been severely damaged or killed by the use of opioids.
 Most of the time these drugs are linked mainly to fentanyl but they have an interesting and tragic history. In December 2016, Grant Robertson and Karen Howlett of the Globe and Mail published a long and detailed article on the history and background of the origins of oxycontin, an opioid medication that went on to cause so much destruction. If you have ever wondered about the origins and effects of this drug, this article is definitely required reading.
 Although opioids were created for use as powerful modern pain medications, they are also very addictive and deadly at high doses. The demand for these drugs has meant that those caught in the addiction lie, steal and cheat their way to finding legal prescription drugs. Over the past decade, fentanyl, which is also another powerful opioid is being illegally produced in the black market to be sold to those willing to buy it.
 The sad part of the opioid story has to do with pharmaceutical companies like Purdue and how they originally marketed oxycontin. Over the years all of this marketing became a success and gradually the medical community began to prescribe opioids like oxycontin for pain more easily than made sense. People became addicted and many lives were ruined.
 According to an article in October 2020 by the National Observer, in Canada there have been over 16,000 deaths from opioids from 2016 to 2020 with over a third occurring in western Canada. In the US about 470,000 have died as a result of opioid use over the past two decades.
 The irresponsible marketing and promotion of these drugs has caught up with Purdue and the medical community and recently in the US, several major settlements have been awarded to pay for the damages done. Legal battles are also taking place here in Canada.
 In more recent years much of the increase in deaths have to do with fentanyl that came from legal prescriptions and from black market varieties sold on the street. Fentanyl is a potent opioid and just a few grains can be enough to kill a person. The problem is that this drug is easily available and is often mixed in with other drugs. It is 20 to 40 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine. This makes the risk of accidental overdose extremely high. It is odourless and tasteless. You may not even know you are taking it. It can be mixed with other drugs such as heroin, cocaine, psychedelics and 'party' drugs or made into counterfeit pills that are made to look like prescription opioids.
 The signs of a fentanyl overdose could include: person is unresponsive, slow, shallow breathing, gurgling sounds or snoring, cold, clammy or bluish skin and severe sleepiness or loss of consciousness. A person can simply take the drug on a whim at a party and end up dead. Most of the people that die are unsuspecting users who were simply experimenting or 'looking for a high'.
 If you think someone has overdosed on an opioid call 911 immediately for emergency medical assistance and use naloxone which is a drug that can temporarily reverse the effects of the overdose and naloxone wears off in 20 to 90 minutes, so it is important to seek further medical attention and give the person another dose of naloxone if signs and symptoms do not disappear or if they reappear. Naxalone should be readily available in all communities.
 First Nations communities across Canada have been dealing with an epidemic of opioid use over the past decade and many deaths have been the result. The insidious side of fentanyl is that only small doses are required which means this drug can be easily transported and delivered to its end users without detection. The ease and access of this powerful and deadly drug has wreaked havoc on remote First Nations.
 Communities in Northern Ontario have been hit hard with this crisis and recently people have organized protest walks to push governments into dealing more aggressively with this issue and to inform the public of this danger.
 Anyone can become a victim of these opioids and it is up to all of us to inform our children, friends and neighbours of the danger lurking right around the corner or at the next party.

HISTORY OF THANKSGIVING
 America has a rich history of Thanksgiving which dates back to our humble beginnings. William Bradford, first governor of Plymouth, authorized the first Thanksgiving proclamation, encouraging the Pilgrims to "...render Thanksgiving to ye Almighty God for all His blessings," (1623). It's no secret that one of the very first acts of Congress, dating back to 1789, resolved to ask Mr. President for a selected day to celebrate Thanksgiving. A few days later, Washington fulfilled this request, calling Nov. 26 a "Day of Public Thanksgiving and Prayer," stating, "Whereas it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favor; and—Whereas both Houses of Congress have, by their joint committee, requested me 'to recommend to the people of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness.'"
 It wasn't until Abraham Lincoln, though — in the middle of the Civil War — that the first annual National Day of Thanksgiving and Praise was proclaimed. I offer Lincoln's words for your perusal:
 "… No human counsel have devised nor have any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy. It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently, and grateful acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People. I do therefore invite my fellow citizens and every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly do to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as it may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, Harmony, tranquility, and Union."
 May The Lord God bless you, Missouri and America, and let us bless God.
 Happy Thanksgiving!

Given such a history, mistrust is not irrational, and the only way to overcome it will be to treat it with respect. Ultimately, the answer is to end the medical racism that affects so many Black people around the world — the belief that Black bodies don’t feel pain, the inability of doctors to recognize life- threatening symptoms on darker skin and the inequitable care given to Black patients across the board.

“Hey, I have to call you back,” Jeremy Erickson said, hanging up the phone to rejoin the others on the Badger State Fire Suppression Module as they loaded into vehicles to respond to another wildfire just reported in the Mark Twain National Forest.
 Erickson serves as the assistant forest management officer from the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest and oversees the fire management program at the Blackwell Job Corps office in Laona, Wisc. He is one of the crewmembers on the Badger State Fire Suppression Module.
 The call he had to drop was from the Mark Twain National Forest’s public affairs officer, reaching out to find out more about the unique crew of which Erickson was a member, and what it was doing in Missouri’s national forest.
 “It’s exciting when you hear that a highly-collaborative firefighting module is on your forest doing good work, so I had to find out more,” said the public affairs officer, Cody Norris.
 When Norris called Erickson, the module had already helped Mark Twain National Forest’s wildland firefighters stop the progression of two new wildfires that day, before Erickson had to hang up to head to a third. The 19th was a gusty November day with red flag warnings across much of the state — a recipe for new fire starts.
 “This can be a challenging time of year for us, and having assistance from a crew like this can be a force multiplier,” said Mark Twain Fire Management Officer Jim Cornelius, explaining the importance of the crew being on forest land.
 After a long summer of supporting Western U.S. firefighting efforts, the wildland firefighters from Mark Twain return to Missouri where wildfire season is just starting in the fall. Having firefighters from other areas coming to support the forest’s program is effective in meeting mission needs and is a big morale booster, notes Cornelius.
 “The Badger Fire Module also symbolizes how effective our wildland firefighting programs are at bringing people together across boundaries to serve the public in a common mission,” he added.
 Across what boundaries does Badger Fire Module build bridges? State boundaries for one. The module hails from Wisconsin, but after arriving, added a firefighter from Mark Twain National Forest who works with Mingo Job Corps in Puxico.
 The Badger Fire Module builds a bridge across Nations. The Forest Service and Blackwell Job Corps have an agreement with Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to bring fire management personnel onto the module from Tribes working under the Great Lakes Agency. One current crewmember is of the Ho-Chunk Nation, others are of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. The BIA, Forest Service, Job Corps and Tribal Nations come together on this crew through a common goal of utilizing prescribed fire for good and stopping destructive wildfires — an excellent example of collaboration in action.
 When Erickson was able to return the call to Norris, he provided more information about the module.
 “On the Badger State Fire Suppression Module, we are all learning from one another, and learning from the forests we visit and support,” he said. He relayed the team’s respect for the professionalism of Mark Twain National Forest firefighters and was excited that his crew had so many opportunities to help while there.
 The crew is also a bridge for sharing experience, as it provides a platform to connect highly trained professionals with Job Corps students interested in fire use and prevention on public lands, as some of the crewmembers are in training roles for parts of the year.

Chef Joey Capparell offers advice to people cooking a Thanksgiving turkey for the first time.
 A former executive chef at Genetti’s Catering, he has prepared turkey dinners for 1,000 or more guests on some Thanksgivings.
 Capparell, now a private chef, starts by soaking a turkey in salty water for 24 hours, uncovered, in the refrigerator.
 To give the turkey a golden crisp, he coats it with soft butter, sprinkles on salt and pepper and roasts it uncovered at 425 degrees for 20 minutes.
 Then he turns the oven to 325 degrees, covers the pan and bastes the turkey regularly until it’s done.
 He says the key to a tender turkey is temperature, not time. Recipes say to cook a turkey for 20 minutes per pound, but he cautions that ovens vary.
 To get an accurate reading, Capparell inserts a meat thermometer into, but not all the way through, the thickest part of the turkey breast.
 When the temperature reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit, remove the turkey from the oven and let it sit for 30 minutes before carving.

Hello Howell County!
 Thanksgiving 2020 is upon us; my how the year has flown by.
 The sales tax revenue continues to come in on the positive side — so surprising! The CART Funds “County Aid Road Trust” are down 6.7% or $54,000 from last year’s collection. These funds are a combination of gas tax revenues, motor vehicle sales tax, and motor vehicle fees that are collected by the state and then through a calculation are distributed to each county.
 The Howell County Commission has been busy approving the various grants that the Sheriff’s Office and Juvenile Office have applied for. The Caulfield Fire Department is applying with SCOCOG (South Central Ozark Council of Government) for a CDBG (Community Development Block Grant) for a new firehouse which the Howell County Commission is the sponsor of.
 The Howell County Commission is continuing the CARES Act process with 43 grants awarded to the public and nonprofit entities for a total of $3,679,377. We are also working with the Small Business Incubator and have awarded 23 small business grants for a total of $245,149 with more in the pipeline. This process will continue through Dec. 30.
 Howell County Clerk Kelly Waggoner and her staff made it through the Nov. 3 General Election with a record number of absentees of 2,962 and total votes cast of 18,793.
 Howell County Collector Dennis Von Allmen and his staff are busy collecting the 2020 personal and real estate taxes. This process will continue until midnight Thursday, Dec. 31. You can pay in person, online, by phone, by mail, or drop box for your convenience during these pandemic times. The Howell County Courthouse and Office Building remain cautiously and partially open to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 It has been great fall weather for the Road & Bridge crews. With the mild temperatures and below average precipitation, the crews have been able to work on the roads continually. They recently went back to 8 hour days for the winter. The North and South Road & Bridge crews chipped and sealed an additional 2-plus miles of new chip and seal roads to Howell County that were previously gravel. This was done with the Road Partnership Program the County has.
 There has been a rash of county road signs stolen around Howell County. If you have any information on the thefts, please contact the Howell County Commission or the Howell County Sheriff’s Office. Remember these thefts are costing you money!
 You can pick up my 2021 appreciation calendars at the Office Building while supplies last.
 The new and improved 2020 Howell County Plat books are now available at the same low price of $35 and maps are available for $40 at the Howell County Clerk’s Office and books are available at the Howell County Recorder’s Office in the Courthouse.
 The full Commission is typically in session every Monday and Thursday. The Howell County Court House and Office Building will be closed Thursday and Friday and will reopen at 8:30 a.m. on Monday. Come by and see us.
 Please stay safe and have a Happy Thanksgiving! Don’t eat too much!

To mask or not to mask should not be a question. Sorry to so poorly plagiarize William Shakespeare; however, several people in our community seem to have the mistaken idea that masks are not needed. Nothing could be further from the truth.
 This pandemic has now affected more than 950 people in Texas County and nine of those people have died (Editor’s note: More than 5,600 people have contracted the coronavirus in the Quill’s coverage area, and 112 of them have died). If you and the people around you will wear a cloth or paper mask, you can help protect each other. Only an N95 mask will help protect “you” from others who are not wearing a mask.
 With COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths rapidly rising in our area, it is imperative that we all social distance and wear a mask.
 I have had the pleasure of being a physician in Cabool for more than three decades, but unfortunately, this is one of the strangest diseases that I have ever seen.
 I have had previously healthy 60-year old patients die, and I have had hospitalized 90-year old patients get better and go home within 24 hours.
 There does appear to be a light at the end of the tunnel. Recently two drug manufacturers have come out with COVID-19 vaccines, each of which were more than 90% effective on more than 40,000 volunteers.
 So until the pandemic runs its course or everyone has been vaccinated, please be courteous to others. Wear a mask and practice social distancing, especially when indoors.
