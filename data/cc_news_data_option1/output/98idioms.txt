QPR 0-0 Crystal Palace: Keith Millen credits team's togetherness
 But Palace were denied right at the end, when Puncheon's cross-shot was beaten out by keeper Rob Green, and substitute Fraizer Campbell appealed in vain for a penalty as he went tumbling over Joey Barton's challenge when the ball ran loose.
 Harry Redknapp's side, who had won their last three home games, stay two points above the drop zone.
 QPR chairman Tony Fernandes was not at the game, having travelled to the Indonesian city of Surabaya after a plane belonging to his AirAsia airline went missing over the Java Sea with 162 people on board on Saturday.
 Palace shut out Austin   ---   Crystal Palace's clean sheet was only their fourth in the Premier League all season - following a 0-0 draw at home to Burnley on 13 September, a 2-0 victory over Leicester on 27 September and a 0-0 draw at Tottenham on 6 December   Keith Millen's side kept out in-form QPR striker Charlie Austin, who had scored in each of his side's previous five home matches.      Shortly after the match began, QPR's fans held a minute's applause as a tribute to their former defender Clarke Carlisle, who is recovering at Leeds General Infirmary after being hit by a lorry in Yorkshire on Monday.
 Millen, placed in temporary charge of Palace for a third time since October 2013, started without a recognised striker, using the recalled Wilfried Zaha in the 'false nine' position.

For example, 44% of all U.S. workers ages 18 to 64 hold low-wage jobs with median hourly wages of $10.22, says the Brookings Institution.


  That’s a total of 53 million people struggling to make ends meet. What’s more, 15% to 20% of men ages 25 to 54 are absent from the workforce.


  In addition, labor’s share of national income, the amount paid in wages, salaries and benefits, has been declining since the 1980s, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. This has contributed to income inequality that is now greater in the United States than in other advanced economies, notes the Pew Research Center.


  Making matters worse, after decades of increases, American life expectancy has begun to decline in the last few years primarily due to drug overdoses, alcohol abuse and suicides, reports the American Medical Association. Depression and despair primarily associated with economic hardship is suspected as the principal cause.


  The impact of these problems, combined with perceptions that the current American economic system is unfair, is reflected in recent surveys.


  For example, in a November Gallup poll, only half of 18 to 39 year olds viewed capitalism positively, down from 66% in 2010.


  Since then, young adults’ opinion of capitalism has deteriorated to the point where socialism is tied in popularity.


  In October, a survey conducted by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation revealed a more urgent concern: that 70% of millennials — who represent the largest generational segment of the U.S. population at 75 million people — were likely to vote for a socialist candidate. And the percentage who said they were extremely likely to do so doubled from 2018 to 2019.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has vowed his government will get answers.The Boeing 737-800 crashed just hours after Iran launched a barrage of missiles at U.S. forces but while the timing of the disaster led to questions by some aviation experts, Iranian officials blamed mechanical trouble.The 737-800 model has been the subject of inspections and repairs since last year, after airlines started reporting cracks in a part that keeps the wings attached to the fuselage, according to the Associated Press. It is an older model than the Boeing 737 MAX, which has been grounded for nearly 10 months following two deadly crashes.Commercial airlines are rerouting flights throughout the Middle East to avoid potential danger during heightened tensions between the United States and Iran.Jumbled schedules could effect as many as 15,000 passengers per day, lengthen flight times by an average of 30 to 90 minutes, and severely bruise the bottom line for airlines, industry analysts said.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

JEA paid the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce $25,000 and told them to use the money to hire Deno Hicks, a local lobbyist who at the time had an undisclosed business partnership with then-CEO Aaron Zahn, to raise money for an innovation conference that the organization helped JEA organize in 2018.
   
 JAXChamber CEO Daniel Davis confirmed Wednesday that a JEA official instructed one of his staffers to hire Hicks. A JAXChamber spokesman later confirmed that JEA paid the organization $25,000 in October 2018 that was used to pay Hicks' firm, the Southern Strategy Group.
   
 RELATED | Read the latest about the possible JEA sale
   
 Davis said he approved the request to hire the Southern Strategy Group but doesn't know which JEA official told his staff to do so. He said hiring someone to raise money for an event wasn't unusual, although he didn't know Zahn and Hicks co-owned a piece of undeveloped property on the Westside, which they've tried to sell for nearly $2 million.
   
 "If we knew then what we do now, we wouldn't have touched this with a 10-foot pole," Davis said in an interview. "Honestly, I'm furious that our organization has been dragged into this. I think this is a mess that we need to get to the bottom of, and we need to move forward as a city."
   
 Although the one-day conference was officially organized by the JAXChamber, the event was closely tied to JEA. In fact, Zahn first came up with the idea and asked the JAXChamber to help JEA organize it, according to emails the Times-Union received in a public records request.
   
 The emails show Zahn hand picked the speakers and approved promotional materials for the event. JEA paid the JAXChamber $325,000 for the event, which covered roughly half of the total cost. JEA also paid employees to attend the Oct. 5 event, which was held at downtown's Prime Osborne Convention Center.
   
 JEA spokeswoman Gina Kyle said that the utility's leadership has "no knowledge of" any payments made to Hicks or his lobbying firm, either directly or through the JAXChamber. Kyle also said the city-owned utility had no records related to any payments made to the JAXChamber for the purpose of paying Hicks.
   
 Instead, JEA provided two invoices it received from a nonprofit affiliated with the JAXChamber, the Innovation Alliance of Florida, related to the $25,000 payment the JAXChamber said it received to pay Hicks. JEA received the first invoice on Oct. 24 requesting payment for a "consulting fee for innovation summit," but JEA canceled it and requested a revised version. The JAXChamber sent a new invoice two days later requesting payment for "marketing and business promotion."
   
 Emails show that Mike Hightower, who was then a member JEA senior leadership, was pushing for JEA to make the payment "as soon as possible." Hightower approved the second invoice on Oct. 26. Zahn approved it on Oct. 29. JEA issued a $25,000 check to the Chamber on Oct. 30.
   
 Hightower said Wednesday that Zahn approached him before the event and asked him to raise money to pay for it. Hightower said JEA's ethics rules would prohibit him from doing so. He said he provided the JAXChamber recommendations for three fundraisers, and Hicks was one of them.
   
 Hightower said he never instructed the JAXChamber to hire Hicks.
   
 Hightower said he doesn't remember how Hicks was paid, but he believed that the two invoices for the $25,000 payment were related to paying him.
   
 Kyle said JEA believed the payment was for "marketing and promotion" of the event and "boosting paid attendance and sponsorship." She said JEA had no supporting documents related to the payment.
   
 JEA justified making the direct payment without a formal bidding process by claiming it was a proprietary service. Hightower signed on Oct. 29 the form JEA requires to circumvent its bidding process, although he left the section of the form blank intended to describe the services and the reasons they were proprietary.
   
 Hicks didn't return a message seeking comment, although a spokesman for Hicks' lobbying firm, which is now called the Southern Group, said in a written statement that the company would return the $25,000 to the JAXChamber.
   
 "In 2018 we were asked to help secure sponsorship for the JAX Infrastructure Innovation Summit," according to the statement. "After we, thru Deno Hicks, successfully secured sponsors, the Chamber compensated us for our work. However, since we've recently become aware of potential procurement inconsistencies, we will be returning the money to the Chamber."
   
 Davis said Wednesday evening the JAXChamber would return any money it receives from the Southern Group to JEA.
   
 JEA's leadership continues to deal with the fallout of a number of controversies involving Zahn, including the creation of an employee bonus plan that could have resulted in a payoff worth hundreds of millions of dollars if JEA was sold and Zahn's failure to disclose his business ties to Hicks.
   
 In addition to being paid $25,000 to raise money for the innovation event, Hicks' firm received a $120,000 lobbying contract from JEA in November 2019 to assist JEA with its now aborted privatization efforts.
   
 The Times-Union first revealed in December that Zahn and Hicks co-owned a property on Lane Avenue that they've been seeking permitting to become the site of an industrial warehouse. Hicks has said he and Zahn were equal partners in the venture and had no plans to develop the land, although a sales listing for the property stated the owner was willing to "build to suit" for a buyer.
   
 Zahn didn't disclose his partnership with Hicks to JEA's ethics department. After the relationship was revealed, Hicks' lobbying group canceled its contract with JEA.
   
 Zahn has been suspended with pay since Dec. 17 as JEA's board of directors determines whether it has cause to fire him.
   
 April Green, the chairwoman of JEA's board, stated Zahn's relationship with Hicks as one of the reasons she believes Zahn should be terminated with cause. However, city attorneys are still investigating and announced earlier this week they need two more weeks to finish.
   
 If Zahn is terminated without cause, he will leave JEA with a severance worth as much a $842,000. He will receive nothing if he is fired for cause.

 It's that time of year again. New Year's resolutions are in full swing, but soon enough (if not already), half of us will forget what we set out to do in the first place. In fact, it's estimated that only 8% of people achieve their New Year's goals, with most people failing by Jan. 12 -- not even two weeks into the new year. Even the best-laid plans (and most noble resolutions) nearly always fall apart far sooner than we'd like.
 But this problem isn't limited to our personal lives -- it can trickle into our work lives, too. After coming back to the office refreshed from the holiday break, we're ready to hit the ground running. But it can be easy to lose steam as the year wears on. Unfortunately, customer expectations don't lose steam, which means your customer service department needs to be exceptional all year long.
 But how can you keep your New Year's enthusiasm past those first few weeks of January? Maintaining resolutions throughout the year requires a measured, realistic approach to sustained improvement. In the interest of kicking off 2020 on the right foot, here are a few best practices for keeping your personal and professional resolutions going strong.
 ## With Customer Experience, Consistency Is Key
 Just like going to the gym once won't make you fit, providing great customer experiences occasionally isn't enough. Customers expect consistently excellent experiences across all touchpoints and departments -- so much so that 73% of customers begin looking for other brands if the level of service offered isn't consistent across departments.

Despite the potential prize of that automatic Champions League place on offer, there was a lack of urgency from Arsenal early on.
 And even when they did fashion a chance for Samir Nasri, the midfielder headed goalwards so half-heartedly it might have raised further questions about commitment, following manager Arsene Wenger's pre-match demand for his side to show they deserve to wear the shirt.
 Rustiness may have been to blame for Nasri's tame effort, seeing as he was returning from injury, but elsewhere there was also lack of care about Arsenal's play.
 They did, however, create another good opportunity when Bacary Sagna sent a deep cross from the right to the back post and Kieran Gibbs headed downwards to force Mark Schwarzer into a decent stop.
 Until that point Fulham had struggled to shake off an end-of-season lethargy but once Andrew Johnson had a sight at goal, testing keeper Wojciech Szczesny with a low effort, they gained some momentum.
 Zamora began to cause problems, particularly down the right, and it was his break that led to Fulham's opener, the striker squaring the ball for Sidwell to slide his shot through the legs of both Johan Djourou and Szczesny.
 Fulham threatened again when Zamora latched on to a through ball and lashed a shot wide from a difficult angle.
 But it was Arsenal who scored next. Abou Diaby played the ball into the feet of Van Persie, who controlled the ball on the edge of the area and then sidefooted home with his next touch to score for the ninth consecutive away game in the Premier League.
 It meant the Dutchman also equalled the record of 18 goals scored in a season from 1 January onwards held by Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo.
