That sure happened this summer. It is hard to go anywhere without seeing brightly colored kayaks and canoes on the tops of vehicles (including my own) or on local waterways. There continue to be reports from across Pennsylvania about retailers who are having trouble keeping boats in stock as unprecedented demand at times outpaces supply.
 For everyone connecting with Pennsylvania waters, there is one overwhelmingly important message that applies year-round and to seasoned and novice boaters alike: Wear your life jacket!
 If you take to the water during the remaining days of summer or this fall, please wear your life jacket. As of this writing, there have been nine recreational boating fatalities in Pennsylvania in 2020, and none of them were wearing a life jacket. That sobering fact is even more stark than the typical year in which 80% of boating fatality victims were not wearing life jackets.
 Law requires that you have a life jacket on board for every person on your boat. Children ages 12 and under are required to wear a life jacket at all times when aboard a boat less than 20 feet long, including all canoes and kayaks. A life jacket must properly fit the individual.

Kottayam (Kerala) [India], Aug 7 (ANI): A Kottayam court on Friday granted bail to Bishop Franco Mulakkal on a fresh bail bond in connection with the nun rape case after he appeared before the court today.   Additional District Court Judge G Gopakumar granted Mulakkal bail on fresh sureties.   The court also recalled the non-bailable warrant issued against him and cancelled the proceedings against the old sureties and listed the matter for further hearing on August 13.   Mulakkal was directed to remain in the state till the next date of hearing and was also asked to participate in the trial of the case without fail.   Earlier, the court had cancelled the bail granted to Mulakkal and issued a non-bailable warrant against him after the accused repeatedly failed to appear before the trial court.   Meanwhile, the Supreme Court yesterday dismissed Mulakkal's plea seeking to discharge him from the case without a trial. The Kerala High Court and a Kottayam trial court had earlier refused to discharge him in the case.   Mulakkal, former head of the Latin Catholic Diocese of Jalandhar, had sought from the trial court to quash charges against him claiming that the rape survivor had implicated him after he took action against her for financial irregularities in the convent.   In June 2018, the nun, who is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab, had complained to the police in Kottayam that Jalandhar Bishop had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016.   After several rounds of questioning, the special investigation team (SIT) of Kerala Police arrested him in September 2018. The SIT had filed the charge sheet against him last year. (ANI)
