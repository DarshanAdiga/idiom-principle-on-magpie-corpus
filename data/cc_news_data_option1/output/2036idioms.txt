LONDON — The World Health Organization said that it will temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine — the malaria drug U.S. President Trump said he is taking — from its global study into experimental COVID-19 treatments, saying that its experts need to review all available evidence to date.
 In a news briefing on Monday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that in light of a paper published last week in the Lancet, that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those that were not, there would be “a temporary pause” on the hydroxychloroquine arm of its global clinical trial.
 “This concern relates to the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in COVID-19,” Tedros said, adding that the drugs are accepted treatments for people with malaria or auto-immune diseases.
 Other treatments in the study, including the experimental drug remdesivir and an HIV combination therapy, are still being pursued.

MORE AUSTRALIANS BACK IN SCHOOL: Students in two more Australian states returned to school full-time as numbers of COVID-19 patients in hospitals across the country fall. New South Wales and Queensland states joined the less populous Western Australia and South Australia states and the Northern Territory in resuming face-to-face learning instead of studying from home online. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said students and teachers should stay home if they are sick, noting “We’re not out of the woods yet." New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said school absences appeared to be higher than normal. Australia's remaining jurisdictions plan to send students back to school in stages through early June.

“So there is an analogy, I think, where it’s neat to see how people come together,” Bailey said.
 People would knit from their homes for the most part, like they are today, he said.
 “It was a home industry, where people would do it at their house, or some in small groups,” Bailey said. “Regardless, the Red Cross would come by and drop off their yarn at the homes of whoever was interested in helping out.”
 Then a few days later, Bailey said, the Red Cross would show back up and pick up what they had knitted.
 “It’s one of those things that you see a similarity where people are trying to do something to make a difference, and they are doing it at home,” Bailey said. “But they are doing it as a team.”

Scripps is partnering with Yahoo to increase the broadcaster's advertising reach at WXYZ Detroit and WEWS Cleveland. The deal combines the local ad solutions of Scripps with "the audience and display advertising leadership of Yahoo," said Scripps in a statement.
 "The collaboration adds Yahoo's display inventory to the portfolio of products sold by the advertising reps at Scripps television stations," said Scripps. "As a result, local advertisers will benefit from expanded digital reach and increased behavioral targeting opportunities that can deliver more meaningful results based on the geography, demographics and interests of potential customers."
 Scripps says WXYZ and WEWS are first up for the Yahoo partnership within the group. The Scripps stations currently provide market-specific content to Yahoo properties, including its ubiquitous homepage.
 "WXYZ and WEWS have long been pioneers that know how to deliver large and engaged audiences," said Brian Lawlor, Scripps senior vice president of television, "but the partnership with Yahoo takes the stations' commitment to the local businesses of Detroit and Cleveland to a significantly higher level. Marrying one of America's oldest media companies with one of the world's savviest new-media brands is great for both organizations, but the real winners are the businesses in Michigan and Ohio who have an effective new way to boost their revenues."   Stations are increasingly working alongside major tech outfits to increase their reach. In July, Gannett announced a similar partnership with Yahoo for some of its stations and all of its newspapers.
 "Yahoo is committed to ensuring local businesses reach high quality target audiences, and only Yahoo offers all the elements needed for great advertising today: the science to understand and target an audience, the art to create lasting engagement with consumers through context, and the scale to reach the right person in the right setting in meaningful numbers" said Lem Lloyd, Yahoo's vice president, North America channel sales and small business. "This partnership meaningfully expands our local offering and offers advertisers access to the technology and scale they need to effectively reach online consumers."

Apple released iOS 13.5 and iPadOS 13.5 to the public last week, but users have already discovered two bugs that seem to have something to do with app certificates. First, iOS 13.5 users were running into an error that made some apps inaccessible. The only way to get the app back up and running was to delete it or offload it and reinstall it. Second, iOS 13.5 users were being asked to install dozens of app updates that they had already installed, and it seems likely that these two issues are related. Last Wednesday, Apple released the final versions of iOS 13.5 and iPadOS 13.5 to the public. The updates contained the Exposure Notification API that developers can use to
