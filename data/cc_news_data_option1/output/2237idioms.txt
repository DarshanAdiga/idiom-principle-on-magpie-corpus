Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. orchestrated a buyout bid unveiled late Friday for its majority-owned TV set-top software company NDS Group in tandem with European private equity outfit Permira.
 The News-Permira offer valued NDS at $3.6 billion. The bid was $60 per share, a 21% premium over NDS’ closing price of $49.70 Friday, although News and Permira said that with adjustments, it’s a few percentage points higher.
 Taking NDS private increases operating flexibility and makes it easier to extract excess cash from the company, which is doing well. Based in the United Kingdom, NDS generates $835 million in annual revenue and solid profits.
 News Corp. will own 49% after the buyout, down from 72% of equity now and 96% voting. Friday’s buyout bid is aimed at taking out the 28% of public shareholders who would receive $960 million.
 In the buyout, Permira would become 51% owner. It is active in European media as an investor in large German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media and TV producer All3Media.
 The NDS board formed a special committee to evaluate the $60-per-share offer. The 21% percentage is a bit lower than the average difference between the offer and pre-offer trading price.
 In a statement, News Corp. said the deal is a way for NDS public shareholders to cash out of an "illiquid investment at an attractive price.” The buyout is conditioned on receiving various approvals.
 Friday’s deal was fully negotiated and Permira completed its due diligence. The equity financing for the transaction will be provided by funds advised by Permira, and the debt financing comes from Wall Street investment houses JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.

A group of minority broadcasters officially asked the Federal Communications Commission to reconsider some of the steps it proposed in what it billed as an effort to help them gain access to capital and stations.
 Specifically it asked the commission to reconsider its definition of "designated entities" that qualified for the FCC's help.
 In a petition for partial reconsideration filed with the FCC Monday, the Council for Diversity and Competition Supporters (DCS), represented by the Minority Media & Telecommunications Council, called that definition arbitrary and capricious. "The linchpin of any serious effort to advance minority and women ownership is an eligible entity definition that is not so dilute as to be ineffectual," it argued.
 The DCS applauded the FCC for not "summarily rejecting" minority ownership proposals -- the MMTC praised the FCC back in March when the order was officially released. That was no surprise since the MMTC had proposed many of the steps.
 But even then the MMTC was concerned with the FCC's definition of "designated entities." The agency defined those entities as "small businesses," which was too broad a definition for their liking.
 The small-business initiatives would modify current FCC rules to make it easier to sell stations and permits to build stations to small businesses as defined by the Small Business Administration.
 The MMTC and commission Democrats wanted the definition to more specifically address women and minorities, but the majority pointed to Supreme Court decisions on race-based criteria as circumscribing their definition, with FCC chairman Kevin Martin calling that a high hurdle. However, the commission called for comment on how a different definition might be crafted to pass muster.
 The DCS said three of the diversity initiatives the FCC adopted, and three more it proposed, are dependent on that definition. Since the commission has said that it was open to rethinking that definition, the MMTC asked it to modify the order to make clear that the definition is an interim measure and "would not be likely to advance minority and women ownership." It also asked that no station applications based on the "small business" definition be precedential.
 The MMTC also asked the FCC to reconsider its decision not to grant minority owners public-interest waivers of its 25% limit on foreign ownership of broadcast properties. The DTC proposed the waivers as a way to give those owners greater access to capital. It would have allowed "noncontrolling" foreign investments above that level where the investment would "help to eliminate a barrier to access to capital for domestic, minority-owned broadcasters."
 The FCC approved a raft of diversity initiatives and proposed others last December in an effort to wrap up its media-ownership rule review by loosening the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership ban while at the same time proposing new TV localism requirements and diversity initiatives.

MTV and retailer Sears are teaming up on a movie musical from the producers of _High School Musical._
 The movie, _The American Mall_ , will premiere on MTV August 11, with the DVD and soundtrack hitting stores the next day. The movie's pickup had been leaked last December, though the Sears partnership came later on, according to a network spokesperson.
 Sears brand integration will be present throughout the movie. Many of the movie’s scenes were filmed at Sears locations, and the characters will wear Sears fashions and products. Co-branded spots will appear during the movie.
 According to MTV, the decision to release the movie at the end of the summer was meant to lead into the back-to-school shopping season. The hope is that the Sears clothing featured in the movie could seed trends for the fall.
 Other promotions will include integration with the movie’s characters in Sears stores, VIP access cards for teenagers, product giveaways and promotion on shows such as TRL. Sears will also have an exclusive special edition _The American Mall_ DVD, with bonus features.
 "We're leveraging _The American Mall_ partnership at every possible touch point, which is really exciting for Sears, as MTV is a highly relevant brand for young adults," said Richard Gerstein, senior vice president and chief marketing officer, Sears.
  _The American Mall_ is about a young woman named Ally, whose mother owns a music store in the mall. Ally meets wannabe rock star Joey, who works part time as a janitor in the mall. However, the mall owner’s daughter Madison gets involved, threatening the store and Ally and Joey’s relationship.
  _The American Mall_ is part of an ever growing list of brand integrated programming on MTV. Last year MTV and deodorant brand Axe _brought back The Gamekillers_ , a faux dating show featuring actors playing “gamekillers” interrupting actual dates. MTV and Pepsi also created a micro-series companion to _The Hills_.

Social-networking site MySpace is planning a major redesign, including one for MySpaceTV, a video site that competes with the likes of YouTube and Hulu.
 The new MySpaceTV will feature a fresh look, as well as true HD support and a full-screen mode. It will also have greater sharing options and an enhanced search ability.

 MySpace said that a major advertiser will have exclusive branding on the site for the launch day, June 18. On June 19, the site will go to its new template with regular advertising.
