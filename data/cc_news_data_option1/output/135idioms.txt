With most people, you can have reasonable discussions of when certain behaviors are unacceptable. With a narcissist, their response almost always flips between "you're crazy/unreasonable/too sensitive" and "I promise to change, so give me a chance." The goal posts are always changing, and you walk on eggshells, with your sense of reality gradually eroding. There are times when the narcissist may have _appeared_ to have changed, except that it's often one step forward and five steps back. And then you get blamed for calling them out, even if they're hurting you.
 Understand this as you're walking out the door: You can never hold a narcissist accountable. It's what's kept you hooked, and you need to leave behind that desire to make them "get it" or "change" if you're going to be able to truly close the door on this relationship.

A major problem I see is when clients tell me how they've been trying to talk things through for years in therapy, and nothing's changed. It may have even gotten worse due to repeated re-experiencing of the trauma, and life doesn't feel safe anymore.
 You can rationalize everything away, and that's not a good thing. Yes, there's a reason the narcissist is the way they areâ€”genetics, family dynamics, substance abuse, etc. It's not your job to analyze why or to get caught in the smoke and mirrors. When it comes to narcissists, the root of the problem is them, and the reason we call it a "personality disorder" in psychiatry is because it cannot change. Nor is it serving you to rationalize your feelings or trauma away or to scold yourself for feeling a certain way, expecting yourself to "just move on." Trauma is stored in our bodies and doesn't disappear simply with logical or positive thinking. The only way through is to process and release it rather than analyze till the cows come home.
