While I hesitate to get critical of our first lady at this time, I feel strongly pointing out an injustice. For the last three months, she has only been seen a few times. I understand her need to stay in, like the rest of us, keeping herself and son safe from the virus.
   
 What I fail to understand is why with all the heroes of all ages contributing to the needs of the sick, the unemployed, supplies for medical workers and testing, food for essential workers and those people lacking the means, this well-to-do woman could not come up with one good cause she could have safely undertaken.
   
 What really brought this to my attention is that prior to the pandemic, at least two organizations singled her out for annual outstanding women awards. I was under the impression that was something that had to be earned!
   
 I cannot think of one good thing -- from showing up at the immigration border during a tense, inhumane time wearing a jacket with an inappropriate saying on the back to tying a Freedom Medal around the neck of Rush Limbaugh.

 Thiessen is wrong about athletes' protests
   
 Mark Thiessen's "Kneeling during anthem is protesting against America" (June 19) is a great example of organizing facts to suit your purposes. The result sounds logical if one doesn't look at the application of the facts or the perverse logic applied.
   
 The flag is a symbol of American ideals. Soldiers went to war for the ideals, not the flag. The protests express disappointment in the country's failure to achieve the ideals. Where better than beneath the symbol of those ideals?
   
 To punctuate his case, he relies on a quote from Colin Kaepernick. Mark, BLM asks white America to listen. So Mark, listen to today's voices. If it's athletes you listen to -- Malcolm Jenkins and LeBron James are the first to come to mind. They explicitly make the point they are not protesting the flag, its ideals or the military but the glaring social injustices blacks endure in this country.
   
 Listen, Mark, as we have been asked to do.

 Thiessen is voice of common sense and reason
   
 I read the editorial section of your paper every day and see journalists express their various opinions. I have mine, too. I must say the talents of Marc Thiessen shine through his column. He dissects an issue and writes with common sense and courtesy ("Kneeling during the national anthem"). He presents the facts.
   
 In my opinion, this is a voice of reason.

 DeSantis minimizes virus spread to help Trump
   
 Governor Ron DeSantis met with the president to prematurely open up the state of Florida so that Donald Trump can win re-election. Even though the state is still in the throes of the pandemic and numbers keep going up in terms of disease rates and deaths, DeSantis continues to pursue the Trump strategy.
   
 As a reward, Trump pulled the Republican presidential convention from North Carolina and placed it in Jacksonville, Florida. It should be noted that the North Carolina governor refused to allow a full-fledged convention without restrictions because of the pandemic.
   
 DeSantis fudged on the COVID-19 data to give the impression that rates were lower and went so far as to fire the person who was in charge of collecting the data. As a result of DeSantis' action, senior citizens are endangered, given the fact that the research has shown many of the victims are 60 and older.
   
 Surprisingly, the Palm Beach Post, while reporting the statistics, did not condemn DeSantis' actions. As has been shown over the past months, politics and economics take precedence over public health and the welfare of people.

No obstante lo anterior, y por un afán metodológico, uno podría continuar dándole la razón a Carlos Peña, ya que esta arbitrariedad del corazón, al igual que el fenómeno del incumplimiento de las reglas, es ampliamente constatable. En la misma sentencia en que la Corte de Apelaciones de Antofagasta ordenó a la AFP devolver los fondos previsionales a una mujer pensionada, la Asociación de AFP sostuvo (sobre la cuestión de constitucionalidad ante el Tribunal Constitucional) que la forma en que la ley ha configurado el ejercicio del derecho de propiedad es el derecho a la pensión. Según su razonamiento, los fondos de las cuentas de capitalización individual de cada trabajador serían nada más que meros registros de los aportes y de la rentabilidad, y la verdadera naturaleza de los fondos de pensiones sería la de un patrimonio de afectación, separado de los cotizantes y administrado por las AFP. A simple vista, es sorprendente la diferencia de opinión de la Asociación de AFP ante las diversas arremetidas contra el sistema de pensiones. Cuando es consultada sobre un nuevo modelo de seguridad social, de reparto y solidario, administrado por una institución pública, califica esta iniciativa como una expropiación de la propiedad de los fondos de los trabajadores, y cuando los trabajadores individualmente reclaman por el resguardo de este derecho de propiedad, resulta que las cuentas de capitalización individual son un problema meramente contable y en realidad el derecho del trabajador no dice relación con sus fondos sino con su pensión. ¿Acaso eso no es también una arbitrariedad? Sí, lo es, aunque no sea precisamente del corazón.

 Emad Shehata, 20, who lived in the 400 block of South Fifth Street, Champaign, when he was arrested on Feb. 19, was sentenced Tuesday to two years of first offender probation and 30 hours of public service work.
 The sentence means that Shehata, who had no previous convictions, can escape having a conviction if he successfully completes his probation.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

As Lifewire's Jeremy Laukkonen articulates, brake assist systems come in one of two designs. Either they have pre-set thresholds to know when extra braking force is needed or they continuously learn and adapt to an individual driver's braking habits. When the technology senses that the driver is implementing an emergency stop, it automatically applies extra stopping power. This helps the vehicle come to a total stop faster and within a shorter distance.

More randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to validate these findings. Personally, if you absolutely must stay on a PPI; I would still go for the implant, BUT, make sure your doctor at the time he places the implant and three to four months later, takes an ISQ (Implant Stability Quotient) with a special device called Ostell or the Penguin. These use soundwaves to see if your implant is fusing to the bone properly.

Bridal cosmetic varies greatly in several cultures, nonetheless it always has the central theme of making the bride appearance outstanding on her behalf wedding day. It can be too often overlooked that, when the Europeans surfaced and began to extend themselves into the larger world of Africa and Asia during the fifteenth and 16th centuries, they will went on to colonize almost all of mankind. Down the road, they would colonize world scholarship, mainly, the writing of the past. History was then drafted and rewritten to show or perhaps imply that Europeans were the only creators of what could end up being called a world. In order to attain this kind of, he Europeans had to neglect, or pretend that to forget, every they had previously knew about Africa.
