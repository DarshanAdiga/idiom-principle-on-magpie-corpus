Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry Kiran Bedi on Thursday said the territoral Chief Minister V Narayanasamy was issuing allegedly incorrect statements by saying she has no authority to appoint or quash the appointment ofthe state election commissioner (SEC). The Chief Minister had said at a press conference on Wednesday that neither the Lieutenant Governor nor the Union Home Ministry has any power to cancel the appointment of the the SEC to conduct the civic polls.
 "The appointment is fait accompli," he had said. The Chief Minister had said theSECwas appointed by the government in July last year through a notification issued as per the then directions of the Speaker on the floor of the House in response to a plea by members belonging to both the ruling and opposition parties.
 In the wake of the Speaker's ruling, the government appointed a former IAS officer of the territorial government T M Balakrishnan as the SEC whose post was vacant for some years. The official also assumed office the same month.
 Bedi, however, reiterated in a statement in her whatsapp message on Thursday that the Union Home Ministry had issued an order on December 20 last year directing the Chief Secretary of territorial government to select the SECthrough a transparent, competitive and fair process by calling for applications for the appointment through an all-India newspaper advertisement. She pointed out in her message that the Home Ministry had also stated that the selection of the incumbent to the post of SEC should be done by an exclusive selection committee headed by the Chief Secretary for timely completion of election process.
 The former IPS officer, with whom the Chief Minister has been at loggerheads on several administrative issues ever since she assumed office, said the Home Ministry had stated that the composition and terms of reference of the Selection Committee for the appointment of the SECmay be finalised by the Lieutenant Governor of the Union Territory. She said the relevant law on the appointment of the SEC and the directions of the Home Ministry in selection of the official were being followed.
 The public statements of the Chief Minister that the Lieutenant Governor had no authority to appoint or cancel the posting of the SEC were factually incorrect. "It is my duty to apprise the people of the correct legal and administrative facts to enable them to demand conduct of civic polls which have not been held for nearly a decade now," she said.
 Bedi said the Supreme Court had delivered a judgment on May 8, 2018 on a civil appeal 'directing the territorial government to notify election to municipalities and other panchayats in the Union Territory without delay. On no account the election process should be stalled after the delimitation of the wards is completed.' She called for compliance with this by all concerned and reiterated: 'What is being done by government of India and the Lieutenant Governor is as per the law and also directions of the Supreme Court.' For want of elected civic bodies, people of the Union Territory have been deprived of central funds meant for the local bodies, she added..

Shorne Woods parkrun


  After the hard, true tarmac surface of Cyclopath, it was a bit of a shock to the system to encounter the twisty, muddy trail paths in Shorne Woods Country Park, with its many ponds and sculptures (I particularly liked the metallic 'Spider tickling Worm' scuplture, a turn-of-phrase I don't use every day).


  But this was proper cross country, proper parkrun, three laps on churned up woodland trails above the Thames Marshes.


  Flat, but very, very squelchy.


  \- Top five list of tough parkruns


  It was a squeeze for so many to tackle the multi-lap 5K distance, along winding paths and over narrow wooden bridges.


  But all 781 managed it, even the brave ones pushing buggies.


  I nearly ended up face-down in mud on one of the slippery corners, but it was all great fun.


  New Year's Day at its best.


  So many NYD double headers


  In previous years, I had tackled the Wanstead Flats and Valentines parkruns in East London (NYD 2018), and the Foots Cray Meadows and Bexley events in Kent (2019).


  On all occasions I have ended up caked in mud - par for the course.


  But the number of choices are mind-boggling.


  One year I am going to stay in Suffolk and run/volunteer at perhaps Kesgrave and Felixstowe, in the east of the county, or perhaps Clare Castle (new record of 232 on NYD) and Haverhill or Grear Cornard in the west.


  Just over the border (across the Stour), I was tempted by Colchester Castle (9am) and Highwoods (10.30am), less then three miles apart - Highwoods was another to celebrate record numbers (349) to its 45th event. Usually, it struggles to break 100.


  I could have also enjoyed an Essex promenade double-header, at Harwich and Clacton Seafront, or stayed inland at Great Notley and Chelmsford, the latter setting a new landmark of 991 on NYD.


  Further afield, it was possible to take part in the Father of all parkruns, the Bushy parkrun, and still make the start-line for one of the many other South-West London events, including Richmond Park (new best of 913).


  One of these days (New Years Day), I'd love to visit the Northumberland pair of Newbiggin-by-the-Sea and Blyth Links, perhaps the Yorkshire duo of Skipton and Cliffe Castle, or Ury Riverside and Aberdeen in Scotland.


  Well, there's no harm in dreaming.

 Nine Line, the clothing company now collaborating with Gallagher, wrote on its website that even though he was acquitted Gallagher now had "a criminal record, and a huge chunk missing from his lifetime pension as a result."
 It said that both Gallagher and his wife, Andrea, felt they had been treated similarly by the "Washington establishment" as Trump frequently claims he is. It added that they felt that "perhaps that's why President Trump took a particular interest in Gallagher's case."
 Nine Line described Salty Frog Gear -- Gallagher's collaboration with the company -- as "a coastal lifestyle brand with an edge."
 "With specialty garments flexible enough for a fishing trip at sea or a weekend afternoon on the range, SFG provides functional, versatile, and affordable apparel solutions for your next outdoor adventure."
 Gallagher's lawyers declined to comment to The New York Times about the collaboration, though the couple's Instagram account created a post criticising the journalist behind the piece, and other pieces about Gallagher's acquittal.

President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday up to 250,000 migrants were fleeing toward Turkey from Syrias northwest Idlib region after weeks of renewed bombardment by Russian and Syrian government forces.Turkey already hosts some 3.7 million Syrian refugees, the largest refugee population in the world, and Erdogan said it was taking steps with some difficulty to prevent another wave from crossing its border. With winter worsening an escalating crisis, the United Nations has said some 284,000 people had fled their homes as of Monday. Up to 3 million people live in Idlib, the last rebel-held swathe of territory after Syrias nearly nine-year civil war.Right now, 200,000 to 250,000 migrants are moving towards our borders, Erdogan told a conference in Ankara. We are trying to prevent them with some measures, but its not easy. Its difficult, they are humans too. Towns and villages have been pounded by Russian jets and Syrian artillery since a renewed government assault last month, despite a deal agreed on last September by the leaders of Turkey, Russia, and Iran to ease tensions.At least eight people, including five children, were killed on Wednesday in on Idlib town when the Syrian army launched missiles that struck a shelter for displaced families, witnesses and residents said. In a report, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA said the city of Maarat al-Numan and the surrounding countryside are reportedly almost empty.Displacement during winter is further exacerbating the vulnerability of those affected. Many who fled are in urgent need of humanitarian support, particularly shelter, food, health, non-food and winterization assistance, the OCHA said. It said those displaced in December were fleeing towards Turkey, other parts of northern Idlib or toward other areas in northern Syria such as Afrin and al-Bab that Turkey seized in previous cross-border military operations.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, has vowed to recapture Idlib. Turkey has for years backed Syrian rebels fighting to oust Assad. Erdogan said last month his country could not handle a fresh wave of migrants from Syria, warning Europe that it will feel the impact of such an influx if the bombing is not stopped.Moscow and Damascus both deny allegations of indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and say they are fighting al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militants. However, their advances also pile pressure on Turkey, which has 12 military posts in the area. On Tuesday, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said it was out of the question for Turkey to evacuate its observation posts in Idlib.

On board the “battleship” (in reality a standard cruise ship, albeit a huge one), there is plenty of evidence that Sabaton’s remorseless pursuit of new ways to attract fans has led to the creation of a genuine community. Up to 40 different countries are represented among the cruise’s 3,000 punters, and Brodén seems thrilled to have brought so many people together. “The Polish fan club started hanging out with the German fan club and so on. I must’ve bumped into 100 people I recognised yesterday.”
