 “My opinion is we’re the backbone of the United States, because we are a small business. I think that’s what the United States is all about,” Thomas told Chang. “We’re so excited to see our customers. We’re so excited about seeing our friends, and we want everyone to stay safe.”
 Chang noted how other businesses are yet to be allowed the option to partially reopen, and Amy expressed her empathy.
 “I feel like you have to be cautious. They need to find a vaccine for this, let’s hope they do. But in the meantime businesses cannot shut down,” Amy said. “There are people in businesses that cannot work at home. They’re not getting paid.”
 Howard Schultz — a former CEO of Starbucks — told “Nightline” how there needs to be understanding that the country is in a public health emergency impacting small businesses that now need loans.
 “Without spending that kind of money, the economic damage to the country and level of unemployment is going to be much greater than the investment that should be made to keep these businesses whole,” Schultz said. “These are people. These are hard-working entrepreneurs. These are families that have put their life savings and entire life into these businesses, and they’re going to be wiped out to no fault of their own.”

MIAMI (AP) - NBA players will be allowed to return to team training facilities starting Friday, provided that their local governments do not have a stay-at-home order prohibiting such movement still in place as part of the response to the coronavirus pandemic.Any workouts that take place would be voluntary and be limited to individual sessions only, according to a person familiar with the league's decision. The person spoke to The Associated Press on Saturday on condition of anonymity because the directives from the league were not released publicly.Group practices would not be allowed yet, and teams will not yet be permitted to organize in-person workouts.But as certain states and municipalities began loosening restrictions on personal movement, the NBA decided it was time to let players return to their practice courts — if only on a limited basis. Georgia and Oklahoma are among the states that have allowed some businesses to reopen and some cities in Florida are expected to loosen their stay-at-home policies in the coming days, even though health officials are warning that such moves are being made too quickly.For those teams in cities where stay-at-home orders still make such a return impossible, the NBA said it would work to find "alternative arrangements," the person with knowledge of the matter said.This move does not mean that a resumption of games is imminent. Still, the decision to let teams back into facilities is a significant step.ESPN first reported details of the NBA's decision.In the NHL, suspended at about the same point of the season as the NBA, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said league officials "haven't made any decisions yet." Daly said only the NHL owes players and teams guidance before April 30 and will consider its next steps in that context.Many NBA players have said they haven't even had access to a basket since the league ordered teams to close their practice facilities on March 19. All-Star Jimmy Butler sent baskets to his Miami Heat teammates earlier this month, but some other players around the league said they haven't even touched a basketball during the shutdown.If they're so inclined, that can now change. There remains no indicator about when a full-fledged return to organized team workouts will resume, however.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said on several occasions that the league does not anticipate being able to decide until sometime in May — at the earliest — if a resumption of the season is possible.The NBA suspended the season March 11. It ordered teams to shutter their facilities eight days later, saying at the time it was doing so "in light of the rapidly-developing coronavirus situation, and consistent with evolving advice from health experts regarding how to promote individual and public health while minimizing the spread of the virus."Johns Hopkins University, which tracks the numbers of those affected or killed by the virus based off official government figures, said the COVID-19 worldwide death toll surpassed 200,000 on Saturday. And the World Health Organization said "there is currently no evidence" that people who have recovered from the virus cannot fall sick again.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Likewise, new reported cases appear to have plateaued at about 80,000 a day.
 But in many countries there were worries of a second surge after lockdown restrictions are eased, possibly also coinciding with a new flu season.
 In hard-hit Iran, health officials Saturday raised fears of a "fresh outbreak" with another 76 fatalities declared, bringing the country's official death toll to 5,650.
 Iran has steadily allowed the restarting of businesses that were closed to stop the virus spread. But Alireza Zali, a health coordinator for the capital, criticised "hasty reopenings" that could "create new waves of sickness in Tehran".
 In the United States, the White House's top pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci said this week that the US will certainly have a coronavirus problem in the fall, which could be complicated by the return of the seasonal flu toward year-end.
 \- At the beach - Even so, the pressure from broken economies and citizens frustrated by stay-at-home orders had areas pushing to open up.
 The governor of the US state of Georgia rejected warnings from top disease experts and allowed businesses like hair dressers, nail salons and bowling alleys to reopen.
 On Saturday many Georgians embraced the return to something resembling normalcy by flocking to the beach.
 "It feels great -- like it's supposed to feel," mother and housewife Rachel Lilly, 39, told AFP, barely lifting her head from her watermelon-themed towel as she relaxed under a cloudless sky on Tybee Island.
 "I'm not concerned" about catching coronavirus, "as long as it's not packed," she said.
 "But if everyone does what we're doing, that's a problem." On Friday, Belgium's Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes announced a staggered plan for reopening businesses and schools in mid-May and restaurants beginning on June 8\.
 "The spread of COVID-19 has been slowed down, but the virus has not disappeared," she warned.
 Italy, nearing the end of the world's longest active lockdown, announced plans Saturday to set price limits on face masks and ramp up antibody testing.
 Italians are awaiting a decision this weekend about which restrictions will be lifted. They will probably be allowed to leave their homes freely for the first time since March 9 by early May.
 In France, which will be on lockdown until May 11, residents have taken to praising health workers and protesting their frustrations with painted banners hung outside their windows.
 "Thank you to the caregivers, shame on the leaders," read one banner hanging outside a building in a Paris suburb.

James had an electric start to his United career and then suffered a dip in form, but he's looked back to his best recently and must be pleased with how his season has gone, considering it's his first at this level and only his second season of senior football at all.
 In midfield McTominay has had another stellar season, forming a fine understanding with Fred and continuing to go from strength to strength. He looks born to be a United player.
 The three forwards eligible for this list have all had big impacts. Mason Greenwood's 12 goals in his first season as a regular first-team member are coming at 0.6 goals per 90 minutes he plays, which is an astonishing record for a player who only turned 18 in October.
 Greenwood is regularly hailed as the best finisher in United's squad and he's looked completely at home at this level. Last season's Jimmy Murphy award winner looks destined for a long career at Old Trafford on the evidence of this campaign.

The two football programs went 62 years without meeting before squaring off 18 times over the past 24 seasons with only two of those as non-district opponents.
 However, enrollment projections reveal when the UIL realigns classifications and districts again in two years the old Temple-Belton rivalry, at least as district foes, will likely be put on hold again with the advent of Lake Belton High School.
 Bob Templeton of Templeton Demographics, a Dallas-Fort Worth based firm that specializes in school district enrollment projections, provided a 10-year forecast to Belton ISD trustees last Monday. Among the myriad of trends revealed, Templeton’s data predicted that Lake Belton’s enrollment will surpass Belton High’s as soon as the Broncos’ campus becomes a four-grade high school for the 2022-23 school year. Lake Belton opens this fall at the Class 4A level with freshman and sophomore classes.
 The forecast for the 2022-23 academic year has Lake Belton with 1,852 students compared to Belton’s 1,683. By the end of the decade, both schools, according to Templeton’s data, will be above 2,000 students.
 Of course, the data cannot factor in unforeseen economic calamities such as what’s been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is a vital gauge for administrators and trustees to factor into planning for facility upgrades and hiring personnel. For the sports-oriented among us, it’s a telling prediction of where those schools will likely fall in the next realignment and raises new questions with regards to football scheduling.
 The Class 6A cutoff number in the previous realignment was 2,220. That number doesn’t remain static but it also won’t drop significantly, if at all. Snapshot enrollment figures for the next realignment should be available in October of 2021. Templeton’s enrollment projection for Belton High that fall is 2,056, which would fall well short of whatever the 6A standard would be and, of course, would be significantly lower than that by the start of the 2022 school year.
 From a football perspective, does Belton dropping in classification and becoming smaller in population than Lake Belton bring the Temple-Belton football rivalry to another halt?
 It is still too speculative to say whether the future of the Temple-Belton football series is in jeopardy. Programs have only recently finalized their current two-year schedules so the thought of penciling in the 2022-23 slate is way down the road. But Temple doesn’t figure to drop back to 5A anytime soon. Yes, the Wildcats open this season against powerhouse Longview, which just dropped to 5A. The student body size difference between the two is small.
 It may well be that Belton’s biggest rivalry for years to come will be from within its own school district as opposed to more traditional ones with Temple or Killeen or Hewitt Midway. As Belton has grown over the decades, many common football rivals such as Gatesville, Taylor and Lampasas came and went while it adopted new ones and reunited with its oldest sparring partner to the immediate north.
 With the new Broncos on the block, the veteran Tigers could well be adjusting to new a batch of rivals once again.

There were a lot of words thrown out when Longview product and Texas Tech defensive lineman Broderick Washington heard his name called Saturday..
 Determination. Sacrifice. Work ethic. Belief. Physicality.
 All of the above paid off for Washington, who was selected in the 5th round of the NFL Draft by the Baltimore Ravens.
 "I just kept working and kept the faith," Washington said. "At the end of my junior season, I didn't see myself being drafted but I took some time, reflected and started living by those words.
 "I made a change and blessings started falling."
 Washington, who was selected 170th overall, was one of three East Texans heading to the league with a deal on Saturday.
 Fellow Lobo teammate JaMycal Hasty and former Gilmer standout Blake Lynch -- who were teammates at Baylor opposite Washington's Red Raiders -- signed with the San Francisco 49ers and Minnesota Vikings, respectively, as free agents.
 On Friday, Daingerfield's Denzel Mims was drafted by the New York Jets and New Boston's Jeff Gladney was picked by the Vikings.
 In total, 33 players that played high school ball in Texas were selected in the 2020 draft.
 "Texas is king," Washington said with a big laugh.
 Washington saw his stock rise significantly this spring after his season seasons with standout performances at the NFLPA Bowl and Senior Bowl before he headed to the combine.
 Those showings earned him a few offers if he wasn't drafted, he said, but getting that phone call was an indescribable moment.
 "I was anxious the entire time, a good nervous though," Washington said. "My biggest thing was just to have an opportunity at the end of the day.
 "I knew I had a few offers waiting so I was relieved a little bit, I guess. Everyone just told me to relax. I fixed a plate a food and then my phone started ringing.
 "It was the Baltimore Ravens. It's really tough to describe that moment."
 Hasty and Lynch will both bring versatility to the next level with him. Hasty drew praise for his blocking and ball-catching ability out of the backfield at running back. Lynch, meanwhile, was a do-it-all standout for the Baylor defense throughout his career.
 It all started with Washington, an offensive lineman at Longview, blocking for Hasty.
 "I've been battling in the trenches my whole life," Washington said. "Lobo football is known for those things -- physicality and toughness.
 "I always thought back to those practices. It was always good on good with such high competition that you couldn't take a snap off, you didn't have a choice. You had to be tough. You had to be physical. You had to be competitive. If not, you were going to get eaten alive.
 "Those are some of the things I've carried with me to this point."

 I couldn't find anything offered by Rheem, but Rinnai published this technical bulletin for their systems after some prolonged power cuts in Canada. They give times for the Hugo X1 UPS that they sell, but also reference the APC SMX750 that is available here. Presumably how long it lasts for will depend on how often you're turning the tap on and off (with most power required for ignition).

MIAMI (AP) -- NBA players will be allowed to return to team training facilities starting Friday, provided that their local governments do not have a stay-at-home order prohibiting such movement still in place as part of the response to the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Any workouts that take place would be voluntary and be limited to individual sessions only, according to a person familiar with the league's decision. The person spoke to The Associated Press on Saturday on condition of anonymity because the directives from the league were not released publicly.
   
 Group practices would not be allowed yet, and teams will not yet be permitted to organize in-person workouts.
   
 But as certain states and municipalities began loosening restrictions on personal movement, the NBA decided it was time to let players return to their practice courts -- if only on a limited basis. Georgia and Oklahoma are among the states that have allowed some businesses to reopen and some cities in Florida are expected to loosen their stay-at-home policies in the coming days, even though health officials are warning that such moves are being made too quickly.
   
 For those teams in cities where stay-at-home orders still make such a return impossible, the NBA said it would work to find "alternative arrangements," the person with knowledge of the matter said.
   
 This move does not mean that a resumption of games is imminent. Still, the decision to let teams back into facilities is a significant step.
   
 ESPN first reported details of the NBA's decision.
   
 In the NHL, suspended at about the same point of the season as the NBA, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said league officials "haven't made any decisions yet." Daly said only the NHL owes players and teams guidance before April 30 and will consider its next steps in that context.
   
 Many NBA players have said they haven't even had access to a basket since the league ordered teams to close their practice facilities on March 19. All-Star Jimmy Butler sent baskets to his Miami Heat teammates earlier this month, but some other players around the league said they haven't even touched a basketball during the shutdown.
   
 If they're so inclined, that can now change. There remains no indicator about when a full-fledged return to organized team workouts will resume, however.
   
 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said on several occasions that the league does not anticipate being able to decide until sometime in May -- at the earliest -- if a resumption of the season is possible.
   
 The NBA suspended the season March 11. It ordered teams to shutter their facilities eight days later, saying at the time it was doing so "in light of the rapidly-developing coronavirus situation, and consistent with evolving advice from health experts regarding how to promote individual and public health while minimizing the spread of the virus."
   
 Johns Hopkins University, which tracks the numbers of those affected or killed by the virus based off official government figures, said the COVID-19 worldwide death toll surpassed 200,000 on Saturday. And the World Health Organization said "there is currently no evidence" that people who have recovered from the virus cannot fall sick again.

Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) chairman Waithaka Kioni will seek another term as one of the five vice presidents at African Volleyball Confederation, better known by its French acronym CAVB.
 CAVB will hold its rescheduled elections between September 27 and October 27, in South Africa.
 CAVB’s elective congress that is held after four years had been scheduled for June 15 and 16, but it was later postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.
 Kioni, who is also the deputy president of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K), confirmed the development, saying national federations across the continent have consulted widely and settled on the new date for the elections.
 “Consultations are still ongoing even as coronavirus pandemic continues to bite, and our hope is that it will be curbed soon so that normalcy returns. Whatever the case, the five confederations in the world must hold their individual congresses three to four months prior to the International Volleyball Federation Board (better known by its French acronym FIVB) elections,” said Kioni, who is also Team Kenya’s head of delegation to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games which have been postponed to next year due to Covid-19 disease.
 “If the coronavirus pandemic shall not have been contained by then, the elective congress shall be postponed again,” Waithaka told _Nation Sport_.

The pandemic also would seem to call for greater collective efforts to resolve deadly conflicts, and not only as a means of helping vulnerable local populations. Owing to the additional socioeconomic stress introduced by the pandemic, ongoing intra- or inter-state conflicts could lead to a further loss of governmental authority or even state collapse in countries already near the breaking point. Beyond the obvious human costs, this would create new and growing pockets where COVID-19 could spread unchecked; larger migration flows over less regulated borders; and greater opportunities for violent non-state actors to exploit the chaos, take root, and expand.

 His making light of hospitals overreacting to this crisis is ignorant; they are preparing for the worst and if it doesn't come? Then what have we lost? And if the worst does come? We have saved lives.

 Hart is mimicking many of the Trumpsters when he says that we are "killing" the economy and need to open it up. Yes, the economy is dying on the vine, but we as a nation can feed people who need food, landlords can forgive rent, and the banks can delay mortgage payments.
   
 What we can't forgive is misguided policy that will pull people out of their homes and produce a second wave of infections - we are not out of the woods yet. Just because infection rates are slowing doesn't mean the coast is clear.
   
 We can all come together to get this into control; oh, but Mr. Hart would label that socialism. So I know I'll get blowback from the Trumpsters that I have no sense of humor but if you think it's OK to make fun of losing 50K senior citizens then please check your morals at the door.

Marino Casem, the legendary coach and administrator at Southern whose four- decade career earned him a spot in the College Football Hall of Fame, died Saturday.
 Casem, who was 85, died in his home according to a story on the Alcorn State University website.
 Known as “The Godfather," Casem had an overall record of 159-93-8 at three Southwestern Athletic Conference schools, coached four national championship teams at Alcorn State and was the National Black College Coach of the Year seven times. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2003.
 A native of Memphis, Tennessee, Casem graduated from Xavier University in 1956 and embarked on career as a coach an athletic director. He spent one season as head coach at Alabama State in 1963, then moved on to Alcorn.
 It was on Alcorn's tiny campus, tucked deeply in the forests of southwest Mississippi, where Casem earned his reputation as an innovative, hard-nosed coach. He stayed there from 1964-86, working dual roles as the Braves athletic director for his final 21 years there.
 He then moved to Southern, serving as athletic director from 1986-99 — a stretch that also included two stints as football coach, from 1987-88 and again in 1992. Casem worked the sideline that year, bridging the gap between his dismissal of Gerald Kimble in late 1991 and his hiring of Pete Richardson in late 1992.
 From there, Southern rose to nearly unprecedented heights. With Casem as his A.D., Richardson built a resurgent, dominant program, winning four SWAC titles in 1993, '97, '98 and '99 (the Jaguars won a fifth SWAC title under Richardson in 2003, after Casem retired).
 Southern also continued as a perennial contender in men's basketball and baseball, and in Casem's tenure, SU won six of the first seven SWAC Commissioner's Cups, given annually to the most accomplished athletic department in the conference.
 As a football coach, his legacy was already secure.
 One of Casem's national championships came at Alcorn in 1984, the season he pulled off his favorite victory. In a showdown against renowned quarterback Willie Totten and receiver Jerry Rice of Mississippi Valley State — a team averaging 59 points in its first seven games — Casem’s Braves won 42-28. They finished the season 9-0 and became the No. 1 team in Division I-AA — a first for a historically black college.
 “He’s done great things — not only here but everywhere he’s gone,” said Melvin Spears, one of Casem’s old players and then the coach at Alcorn when the Braves added his name to their football field: Casem-Spinks Stadium. “He’s one of the pioneers of our conference and around the country.”
 Although it wasn’t his first head coaching job, Casem said his experience with the Braves set the tone for his entire career.
 “I grew into manhood at Alcorn,” he said. “It formed my life habits. It was a very, very, very, very lasting experience."
 More than 60 of his Braves found their way into NFL camps over the years, including Leslie Frazier, the defensive coordinator of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and former head coach of the Minnesota Vikings.
 Casem came to Southern in 1987 and in the next two seasons produced a 14-8 record before stepping aside to concentrate on his duties as athletic director. Casem returned to the sideline in 1992 after he fired Kimble, who compiled a 14-18-1 record. After the leading candidate to take Kimble’s position, Houston Markham, decided to remain at Alabama State, Casem took over the Jaguars on a temporary basis, going 5-6.
 The man Casem selected after that season brought 17 seasons of excellence to Southern. Richardson coached the Jaguars from 1993-2009, beating archrival Grambling 12 times in the Bayou Classic and leading them to four black college national championships.
 Casem also presided over nine SWAC women’s all-sports trophies and 62 league championships in his 12 years as athletic director.
 Casem also was an eyewitness to history. While he was A.D. at Alcorn in 1979, the Braves became the first historically black college to win an NIT basketball game when coach Davey Whitney's squad beat Mississippi State 80-78. A year later, Alcorn was the first historically black college to win an NCAA tournament game; they defeated South Alabama 70-62.
 At Southern, the Jaguars became the first HBCU to win an NCAA baseball tournament game when coach Roger Cador’s team beat No. 2 Cal State Fullerton 1-0 in 1987.
 In men's basketball, the Jaguars, a No. 13 seed in the NCAA tournament, beat No. 4 seed Georgia Tech 93-78.
 Casem played college as a center/linebacker at Xavier before the Gold Rush dropped the sport. He finished his playing career at Northern Colorado but graduated from Xavier in 1956.
 After a stint in the Army and after honing his skills as an assistant coach, Casem took over as head coach at Alabama State in 1963. The season ended with a 2-8 record, but he was already seen as an up-and-comer. The next season, Casem accepted the head coaching job and athletic director’s role at Alcorn.
 Casem came to prominence with the Braves, compiling a 132-65-8 record, and found success as an administrator at Alcorn and Southern.
 He said he found a secret to coaching success.
 “To be able to command strong-willed people,” he said, “you had to be innovative, you had to demand respect by the way you acted. And you had to adjust to rapidly changing situations.”
