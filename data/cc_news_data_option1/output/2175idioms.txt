Democrats are beginning to rally around a progressive, three-part climate platform that prioritizes environmental justice. But will Joe Biden fully embrace it? If so, could it sway the 2020 election? Or will few voters care in this turbulent year?
 On this episode of _Political Climate_, we speak to Maggie Thomas, political director at Evergreen Action, a new group created by former Jay Inslee campaign staffers to promote a comprehensive climate plan for Democrats.
 We discuss how the left came to unite around the concept of pursuing rapid decarbonization through sector-specific standards, large-scale public investments, and a commitment to justice and equity (as Vox's David Roberts first reported). We also learn how Thomas and her colleagues crafted Inslee's environmental justice plan -- a plan that's all the more relevant in light of recent protests.
 Plus, we get a read on the most politically attractive elements of the crystalizing climate platform. Are there policies that progressive Bernie Sanders supporters, moderate Biden fans and perhaps even some Republicans could support?

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Orlando's First Presbyterian Church has made a donation of over $500,000 to Central Florida's nonprofits to help ease some of the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus. The church pooled money from from virtual collection plates, and used leftover funds from a capital campaign, bequests and an annual missions drive, Senior Pastor David Swanson said. “We have what we call our Good Samaritan Fund to help people pay the light bill, pay the rent, make a car payment, pay the mortgage,” Swanson told the Orlando Sentinel. “Normally we get three, maybe four requests a month. But since COVID started, we’ve had 170. People are desperate.” In addition, church officials decided to support the region’s nonprofit agencies that feed, shelter and serve the tens of thousands of Central Florida workers who have been furloughed or laid off. Checks ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 will go to 14 charitable agencies in the area. “This is great news,” said Dave Krepcho, the food bank’s president and CEO. “Since mid-March, we’ve been providing enough food for about 300,000 meals a day — and it takes a lot of finances to do that.\" First Presbyterian has annual revenues of about $7 million and typically donates at least 10 percent of worshipers’ offerings over the course of a year. This is the first time the church has given out so much as once, Swanson said. “What actually started it was a study I read that said 50 percent of nonprofits could fail as a result of COVID-19,″ Swanson said, citing an expected drop in philanthropic donations and grants. “That was very sobering. So I started calling around to see how people were doing.”

CAPE TOWN - Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille has reiterated that a number of processes are underway probing the construction of the controversial Beitbridge border fence.


  De Lille and department officials accounted to Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts on the matter on Wednesday.


  The committee believes the fence, valued at R37 million, was not fulfilling the role it was intended to, calling it a waste of money.


  De Lille said investigations were under way to ascertain if due processes were followed.


  “We are determined to get to the bottom of this and once the investigations have been completed, we will bring the findings to the public, Parliament and to the portfolio committees because corruption steals from the poor.”


  She said a national Treasury report on the matter would also be released next week.


  “Either processes were followed or not followed but we won’t know until we have got the facts and the truth.”

District 17 includes Clay and Turner counties. District 19 includes Douglas, Hutchinson, Hanson and McCook counties and a portion of Bon Homme County.


  In both races, the winners had trailed or were neck and neck for much of the evening before moving ahead in the final count.


  • In the District 17 Senate primary, incumbent Art Rusch of Vermillion defeated challenger Nancy Rasmussen of Hurley 1,002-996 for the right to advance to the November general election.


  Tuesday’s primary race was a case of two counties. Rusch won his home Clay County by a 600-291 margin, while Rasmussen won her home Turner County by a 705-402 margin.


  • In the District 19 House primary, incumbent Kent Peterson of Salem and newcomer Jessica Bahmuller of Alexandria claimed the two slots with 1,881 and 1,741 votes, respectively.


  The third candidate, Marty Overweg of New Holland, has served in the House as a gubernatorial appointment and finished third in Tuesday’s primary with 1,720 votes.


  State law outlines the recount procedure for legislative races, according to spokeswoman Rachel Soulek with the South Dakota secretary of state’s office.


  “Recounts must be requested by the losing candidate,” she said. “The petition for recount will have to be filed with each county auditor’s office in the legislative district.”


  The petitions must be filed within three days following the official state canvass, scheduled for 10 a.m. June 9. All recounts must be completed within 14 days following the filing of the petition.


  The following are results from the other area primary races for the South Dakota Legislature.


  • In District 16, the Republican primary for House resulted in incumbents Kevin Jensen of Hudson and David Anderson of Canton claiming the top two spots in the three-man field.


  They finished with 1,444 and 1,257 votes, respectively, ahead of challenger William “Bill” Shorma of Dakota Dunes with 1,072 votes. Shorma had formerly served in the Legislature and was seeking a return to Pierre.


  • In District 17, the GOP primary winners for the two House seats were newcomers Sydney Davis of Burbank and Richard Vasgaard of Centerville with 1,272 and 844 votes, respectively.


  • In District 21, which covers Charles Mix, Gregory and Tripp counties and part of Bon Homme County, the Republican primary for Senate saw Erin Tobin of Winner defeat Lee Qualm of Platte 2,155-1,366.


  VOTER TURNOUT


  Because of COVID-19 safety concerns and the voters’ desire for convenience, area counties reported record numbers of absentee ballots. In some cases, Tuesday’s primary rivaled past general elections for early balloting.


  The absentee ballots cast statewide in Tuesday’s primary election smashed a previous record, Soulek said. As of 1 p.m. Wednesday, a total of 88,911 absentee ballots were received statewide — four times the previous high mark of the past decade.


  “This number far outpaces the average absentee ballots cast in previous primary elections,” she said. “Between 2010 and 2018, the highest primary election total for absentee ballots occurred in the 2018 primary election, when 22,048 absentee ballots were cast.”


  The Yankton County voter turnout for Tuesday’s election was far above the county’s average for primaries. Republicans cast 2,296 ballots out of the party’s 6,353 registered voters for 36.1% turnout, while Democrats cast 1,618 ballots out of the party’s 3,936 registered voters for 41.1% turnout. In addition 235 voters cast ballots in nonpartisan races (not requiring party affiliation).


  Yankton County reported 2,682 early ballots cast, divided among 997 Democrats; 325 independents/NPA (no party affiliation), four Libertarians and 1,356 Republicans.


  The 2,682 early ballots comprised nearly 65% of the 4,149 votes cast in Tuesday’s election.

BAY ST. LOUIS, Miss. (AP) — A man who allegedly stripped naked as he ran from deputies in Mississippi has been arrested on drug charges. Hancock County sheriff’s deputies saw Ryan Millet arguing with a woman, Misty Quiroz, at a gas station in Bay St. Louis on Wednesday and approached the couple, Chief Deputy Jeremy Skinner told The Sun Herald. The deputies started searching their car after Quiroz allegedly admitted to having marijuana in the vehicle. Skinner said that's when Millet, who appeared to be under the influence of drugs, ran away and started taking off his clothes. Deputies chased him down and later used a stun gun to arrest him and bring him back to the gas station, with his clothes in hand, Skinner said. “He was actually caught naked, so that’s how he gets escorted back,\" he added. Millet and Quiroz were booked into Hancock County jail on drug charges after deputies found marijuana and methamphetamine in their car, Skinner said. It was not immediately clear if they have lawyers who could comment on their behalf.

MADRID (AP) — One missed practice was enough to raise concerns about Lionel Messi. Messi’s presence in next week’s return of the Spanish league was put in doubt by some Barcelona media after he trained separately from the group on Wednesday. Even though Barcelona said there was no reason to worry about Messi, and that he simply underwent an alternative training program in the gym, some reports said there could be more to it. Catalan channel TV3 said Messi has a minor thigh muscle problem that could keep him from being ready to play in Barcelona’s June 13 match at Mallorca, the team’s first since the league was halted nearly three months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. TV3 said late Wednesday that Messi underwent tests to determine the real extent of the injury. Barcelona did not confirm Messi had to be tested. Thursday was a scheduled rest day for the club, with the squad returning on Friday to continue its preparations. Messi missed nearly two months at the beginning of the season after hurting a calf muscle in the first preseason training. He is the league leading scorer with 19, five more than Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema. Messi also has the most assists, with 12. Defender Clément Lenglet is set to miss the trip to Mallorca because of an accumulation of yellow cards, but striker Luis Suárez, who underwent right knee surgery in January and was expected to miss the season before the pandemic, has been practicing normally and is expected to be back in action in Mallorca. Ousmane Dembelé is not likely to return as he continues to recover from a hamstring problem. Barcelona has a two-point lead over Real Madrid with 11 rounds remaining. Madrid resumes on June 14 against Eibar at Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium in the club’s training center....

I giallorossi non lo hanno preso. C’era stato un contatto importante con l’Atletico Madrid, poi non concretizzatosi. Il 20 gennaio il presidente del Racing ha cambiato la clausola portandola a venti milioni. E poi l’Inter ha fatto il resto. Futuro? Secondo me - ha detto l’argentino vicino a Mauro Zarate, il cui fratello Rolando compone l’entourage di Lautaro Martinez - alla fine andrà al Barcellona.

Per me dovrebbe restare all’Inter a vita, questo è il centravanti dei prossimi dieci anni. È un campione, un giocatore fantastico. Se l’Inter lo perdesse commetterebbe un errore. È uno da Barça”.

A former Canadian Alliance leader and Conservative MP has resigned from Telus' board of directors and as a strategic adviser to a law firm after comparing racism to his experience of being mocked in school for wearing glasses.


  Stockwell Day made the comments during a panel on CBC's "Power & Politics" Tuesday.


  Day had said on the show that he knew "for a fact" that most Canadians including his relatives, friends, and opponents are not racist.


  Telus said Day's comments "are not reflective of the values and beliefs" of the organization.


  McMillan LLP, a law firm with offices in four Canadian cities, also announced Day's resignation Wednesday in a statement.


  CBC says Day has also stepped down from his role as a commentator.


  "Should we all be more sensitive about any kind of hurting or insulting people whether it's racist or not?" Day said on the show.


  "Should I have gone through school and been mocked because I had glasses and was called 'four eyes' … should I have been mocked for all that? No, of course not. But are Canadians largely and majority racist? No, we are not."


  Day apologized for his comments on Twitter on Wednesday.


  "By feedback from many in the Black and other communities I realize my comments in debate on Power and Politics were insensitive and hurtful," Day wrote.


  "I ask forgiveness for wrongly equating my experiences to theirs. I commit to them my unending efforts to fight racism in all its forms."


  In its statement, McMillan LLP said "At McMillan LLP, we believe that systemic racism is real and that it can only be addressed when each of us -- as individuals and organizations -- commits to meaningful change. Yesterday, Stockwell Day made comments during a televised interview that run counter to this view."

Some of them converged on Parliament and the nearby Downing Street office of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A few scuffles erupted between protesters and police outside the street's heavy metal gates.


  Inside, Johnson told a news conference that he was "appalled and sickened" by Floyd's death on May 25 when a white Minneapolis officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee on the handcuffed black man's neck for several minutes.


  Earlier, "Star Wars" actor John Boyega, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents and grew up in south London's Peckham neighborhood, pleaded tearfully for demonstrators to stay peaceful.


  "Because they want us to mess up, they want us to be disorganized, but not today," he said.


  Boyega recalled the case of Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old black man from southeast London who was stabbed to death in 1993 as he waited for a bus. The case against his attackers collapsed in 1996, and a government report cited institutional racism by the London police force as a key factor in its failure to thoroughly investigate the killing.


  "Black lives have always mattered," Boyega said. "We have always been important. We have always meant something. We have always succeeded regardless and now is the time. I ain't waiting."


  Police appeared to keep a low profile during the demonstration and the ensuing marches.


  Earlier, the U.K.'s most senior police officer said she was "appalled" by Floyd's death and "horrified" by the subsequent violence in U.S. cities.


  Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said the London force would "continue with our tradition of policing using minimum force necessary."


  While the London protesters expressed solidarity with Americans protesting Floyd's death, many also pointed to issues closer to home. "Racism is a pandemic," said one placard at the London demonstration.

Top shuttlers Ashwini Ponnappa and Lakshya Sen are among the 20-odd Indian players who have started training at the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) in Bengaluru as the sport took its first step towards resumption after the COVID-19 hiatus.
 Confined to their homes for more than two months due to the nationwide lockdown to contain the health crisis, the shuttlers started training at PPBA after the Sports Authority of India (SAI) laid down rules for resumption of training late last month.
 "Some top national players have been training for last two weeks here. We have 16 courts spread out and about 20 India players are currently practising here. We have separate timings and sessions," Vimal Kumar, head coach and director, PPBA told _PTI_. "Most of the trainees out of the total 65 are currently not in the city but they are very keen to come and start training."
 Vimal said training is optional at this stage. "We have sent out a mail that they should come in batches of 6 or 10 as they have to go through two weeks of home quarantine," he said. "People coming from Maharashtra need to go through institutional quarantine so we have asked them to avoid that. We are not forcing anyone to come."
   
   
 The players training currently include doubles exponent Ashwini, a three-time Commonwealth Games medallist, former World No. 13 Ajay Jayaram, and Lakshya, who had a stellar season with five titles last year. Besides, India regulars Mithun Manjunath, BM Rahul Bharadwaj and Maisnam Meiraba are also training there. The former India coach said being away from the game for such a long time has likely affected the sharpness of the top players and they will need around six weeks to get going.
 "For the elite players, it will be very tough for them because in these 2-3 months, they must have lost 30-40 per cent of their sharpness, the overall level would have dropped. It will take them a month and a half to get back into good shape," he said.
 Vimal said initially the players will be focusing on endurance and working on their reflexes. "The players have been following fitness programs so they are not totally unfit but badminton involves a lot of skill so their reflexes can go down due to the lockdown. So they will be building on physical strength and endurance," he said.
 "There are no tournaments in sight right now but they have to train presuming that they can play in September. It is an opportunity as you can build their base, plan systematically during this break."
 Vimal, 57, doesn't see Hyderabad Open Super 100 tournament happening in August but he is happy that Badminton World Federation (BWF) has come up with a revised calendar with a mention of the event as it gives hope to the players.
 "I don't see Hyderabad Open happening in August but BWF is at least trying and they have made a mention like that. It gives a lot of positivity to the players, they can look at that and prepare but whether the event will happen, it depends on a lot of factors," he said.
 Asked what are the safety protocols that are in place at PPBA, which is within the Padukone-Dravid Centre of Excellence, Vimal said he doesn't believe in too much policing but they have taken certain measures.
 "When they come, their temperatures are taken at the gate. We don't allow any visitors, so everything is fine, it is just that the swimming pools and gyms are not accessible right now," he said.
 "But we don't want to be policing our players. I keep telling the youngsters to take the responsibility to take care of themselves, not to mix with anyone. They have all been given instructions to maintain the best hygiene and get on with it. I have told them clearly if one gets cold or falls sick, whole program gets stalled, so all have to be responsible."
 Vimal also feels sports shouldn't be clubbed with recreation. "In India, sports in not a priority, it doesn't get a mention anywhere. It shouldn't be combined with recreation. Sportspeople have responsibility, health really matters in sports, they are responsible and they can take care, so they have to be allowed," he said.

As he points out in this passage: "Language can allow the speaker to remain on the surface of thought, mouthing dogmatic slogans and commonplaces in black and white, transmitting messages rather than meaning, placing the epistemological weight on the listener (as in 'you know what I mean?'). It can attempt to re-create an experience, give shape to an idea, explore in-depth, and not only the intuition of a revelation on the surface. For the other boys [Pinocchio's classmates], this distinction is invisible. For them, the fact that Pinocchio speaks 'like a printed book' is enough to label him an outsider, a traitor, a recluse in his ivory tower."

No, it's not a good idea to combine finances with anyone you're not married to. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you two are thinking about your finances and your future - and I'd never wish anything bad for you - but all kinds of things can happen before you become husband and wife. What if you spend time paying off his debt, or vice versa, then the relationship doesn't work out?   However, this doesn't mean you can't begin working together on budgets for the future, and planning and dreaming about the goals you have together. The thing to keep in mind is you'll both need to be operating in full transparency mode to make it happen. He should know all about your income and debts, and you should know all about his. Along the way, you two need to have serious, regular discussions about saving, spending and debt to ensure you're completely on the same page with your finances before the big day.   There you go. My advice is both of you should pay only your own bills until after you're married. And remember, once that happens there's no yours and his anymore - it all becomes ours.   Dave
 Self-insure long-term care needs?
 Dear Dave,   I've been researching long-term care policies. Can you reach a point financially where you can self-insure long-term care needs, and not buy a long-term care insurance policy?   Paul
 Dear Paul,   It's possible, mathematically speaking, if you have the resources available to pay for the care you'd receive in a nursing home or similar facility for about 20 years. Not many folks have that kind of money, though. I think it's a large enough bill that it makes sense to transfer the risk to a long-term care insurance policy.   Keep in mind, too, if you're married you have to think about your spouse, and make sure they have enough to live on comfortably at the same time. That's a lot of money. And that's why I advise virtually everyone to put good, long- term care coverage in place at age 59 or 60. It can mean the difference between living with dignity, or having to depend on the government!   Dave

WASHINGTON -- American Airlines Group Inc said Thursday it will boost its U.S. flight schedule next month over dramatic reductions since the coronavirus pandemic, planning to fly more than 55% of its July 2019 domestic capacity.
 The largest U.S. airline will also boost its international flights schedule next month, flying nearly 20% of its July 2019 schedule.
 By comparison, American flew just 20% of its domestic schedule in May and is flying 25% in June, said Vasu Raja, American Airlines' senior vice president of network strategy.
 "As an airline, we've consciously bet on demand coming back. We have bet the economy," Raja said, noting American has been operating a larger schedule than U.S. rivals.
 Raja told Reuters that the airline would fly just over 4,000 flights on peak days in July compared with nearly 2,000 on peak days in May. That is still down from the peak 6,800 daily flights before the crisis.
 Airlines are adding new cleaning procedures and requiring masks on board to reassure customers it is safe to travel
 In total, American plans to fly 40% of July 2019 capacity.
 The airline is boosting flights from New York City airports, Los Angeles and Washington and adding flights from its Dallas Fort Worth and Charlotte hubs. It is also boosting flights to major cities in Florida, Gulf Coast cities and mountain destinations as national parks and outdoor recreational spaces reopen.
 In late May, the airline carried a daily average of about 110,000 customers - an increase of 71% over the 32,000 daily average the airline served in April, but still far below last year. Load factors rose to 55% by late May.
 American plans to resume service to additional European and Latin American destinations in August. It will resume service to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from Miami on July 7. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Christopher Cushing)

Middlesbrough has one of the highest rates of children requiring care in the UK.


  Stark analysis of Government figures also shows 35% of the town’s children are classed as living in poverty.


  This is based on the number of children living in families with a household income of less than 60% of the UK average.


  Meanwhile, the proportion of the council’s budget earmarked for children’s services has increased from 13% to 35% since 2010 - as the amount of Government funding received is cut greatly, as demand has soared.


  Last month, councillors heard how workshops had been launched for social workers to give them “clarity and confidence” about their roles on the back of the Ofsted verdict.


  Director of children’s services Sue Butcher said efforts were underway to build a “culture of high challenge and high support” to help turn the department around.

Top shuttlers Ashwini Ponnappa and Lakshya Sen are among the 20-odd Indian players who have started training at the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) in Bengaluru as the sport took its first step towards resumption after the COVID-19 hiatus.Confined to their homes for more than two months due to the nationwide lockdown to contain the health crisis, the shuttlers started training at PPBA after the Sports Authority of India (SAI) laid down rules for resumption of training late last month."Some top national players have been training for last two weeks here. We have 16 courts spread out and about 20 India players are currently practising here. We have separate timings and sessions," Vimal Kumar, head coach and director, PPBA told PTI. "Most of the trainees out of the total 65 are currently not in the city but they are very keen to come and start training."Vimal said training is optional at this stage. "We have sent out a mail that they should come in batches of 6 or 10 as they have to go through two weeks of home quarantine," he said. "People coming from Maharashtra need to go through institutional quarantine so we have asked them to avoid that. We are not forcing anyone to come."The players training currently include doubles exponent Ashwini, a three-time Commonwealth Games medallist, former World No. 13 Ajay Jayaram, and Lakshya, who had a stellar season with five titles last year. Besides, India regulars Mithun Manjunath, BM Rahul Bharadwaj and Maisnam Meiraba are also training there. The former India coach said being away from the game for such a long time has likely affected the sharpness of the top players and they will need around six weeks to get going."For the elite players, it will be very tough for them because in these 2-3 months, they must have lost 30-40 per cent of their sharpness, the overall level would have dropped. It will take them a month and a half to get back into good shape," he said.Vimal said initially the players will be focusing on endurance and working on their reflexes. "The players have been following fitness programs so they are not totally unfit but badminton involves a lot of skill so their reflexes can go down due to the lockdown. So they will be building on physical strength and endurance," he said."There are no tournaments in sight right now but they have to train presuming that they can play in September. It is an opportunity as you can build their base, plan systematically during this break."Vimal, 57, doesn't see Hyderabad Open Super 100 tournament happening in August but he is happy that Badminton World Federation (BWF) has come up with a revised calendar with a mention of the event as it gives hope to the players."I don't see Hyderabad Open happening in August but BWF is at least trying and they have made a mention like that. It gives a lot of positivity to the players, they can look at that and prepare but whether the event will happen, it depends on a lot of factors," he said.Asked what are the safety protocols that are in place at PPBA, which is within the Padukone-Dravid Centre of Excellence, Vimal said he doesn't believe in too much policing but they have taken certain measures."When they come, their temperatures are taken at the gate. We don't allow any visitors, so everything is fine, it is just that the swimming pools and gyms are not accessible right now," he said."But we don't want to be policing our players. I keep telling the youngsters to take the responsibility to take care of themselves, not to mix with anyone. They have all been given instructions to maintain the best hygiene and get on with it. I have told them clearly if one gets cold or falls sick, whole program gets stalled, so all have to be responsible."Vimal also feels sports shouldn't be clubbed with recreation. "In India, sports in not a priority, it doesn't get a mention anywhere. It shouldn't be combined with recreation. Sportspeople have responsibility, health really matters in sports, they are responsible and they can take care, so they have to be allowed," he said.

Myślenie w kategoriach radykalnego indywidualizmu ma swoje korzenie w pewnych wzorach przygotowywania do życia w społeczeństwie młodszych pokoleń Polakow. Niedawno zrobiliśmy badania prekariatu w ramach projektu finansowanego przez Narodowe Centrum Nauki i okazało się, że znaczna część młodych Polakow jest za tym, żeby zlikwidować obowiązkowe ubezpieczenia społeczne i obowiązkowe emerytury. Cechuje ich skrajny indywidualizm. Po pierwsze to kwestia socjalizacji. Po drugie w praktyce bardzo wielu Polakow czuło i czuje, że ze strony państwa za wiele oczekiwać nie może. W sytuacjach kryzysowych, jak np. bezrobocie, państwo specjalnie im nie pomaga. Ale nie mogą też zbyt wiele oczekiwać z tego względu, że boją się znaleźć w stygmatyzowanej społecznie grupie roszczeniowcow, ktora rzekomo żyje przyzwyczajeniami z PRL, nawet jeśli w tym PRL nie miała okazji żyć.

La justicia portuguesa dijo que estaba interrogando a testigos dentro de la investigación de la desaparición en 2007 de la niña británica Madeleine McCann, cuyo caso volvió a resurgir el miércoles con la identificación de un nuevo sospechoso alemán.


  "La investigación continúa, concretamente interrogando a testigos", según un comunicado publicado el miércoles por la noche por la fiscalía de Faro, al sur de Portugal, en el que se precisa que existe un trabajo conjunto con "las autoridades británicas y alemanas".


  En otro comunicado, la policía judicial confirmó "elementos que parecen mostrar la posible participación de un ciudadano alemán" de 43 años, "con antecedentes penales, que vivió en Portugal entre 1996 y 2007".


  La policía alemana anunció el miércoles que estaba investigando a un sospechoso, un delincuente sexual que ya fue condenado en varias ocasiones, en particular por haber abusado sexualmente de menores. Actualmente se encuentra cumpliendo una larga condena "por otro asunto", precisó la policía.


  A lo largo de 13 años, el caso de la pequeña Madeleine ha dado numerosos giros y ha provocado grandes decepciones. Centenares de personas han sido interrogadas, tanto por la policía portuguesa como por Scotland Yard.


  Madeleine McCann desapareció de su habitación el 3 de mayo de 2007, a pocos días de su cumpleaños, en un bloque de apartamentos en la costa de Praia da Luz, en el sur de Portugal, donde pasaba las vacaciones con su familia.


  Los propios padres de la niña, Gerry et Kate McCann, fueron detenidos y finalmente exonerados durante la rocambolesca investigación, que acabó con el despido del inspector jefe portugués encargado del caso.


  Tras haberlo cerrado en 2008, la policía portuguesa volvió a abrir el caso cinco años después, sin éxito.


  La policía alemana hizo un llamamiento a testigos que tengan información sobre este nuevo sospechoso.


  En una declaración difundida por la policía británica, los padres de Maddie se "congratularon" el miércoles por esta nueva pista encontrada en Alemania.

While the case will be presented to a grand jury, local activists have called for the firing of the city’s police chief, Brian Manley. National protests spurred by the death of Floyd also inspired demonstrations over the weekend in Austin that at times became antagonistic and violent. One man suffered severe injuries after he was struck by a rubber bullet.
 Although Austin was not the only city in Texas to have demonstrations, the death of Ramos served as a reminder of the tensions that have long plagued the city.
 “Austin is a city trying to find itself, especially as it relates to the minority community,” said state Rep. Sheryl Cole, D-Austin, who was also the first black woman elected to the City Council, in 2006.
 According to the Austin Business Journal, the city welcomes an average of 100 new residents each day and has seen more proportionate growth from net migration than any other metro in the United States since 2010.
 In fact, the city’s growth and job opportunities — plus the fact that he has family nearby — have kept Raul Perez in town for the better part of two decades. His parents immigrated here when he was only 8. Besides a stint at Texas A&M; University, he’s called Austin home ever since.
 “I’ve been fortunate enough to experience some of the growth, but at the same time it’s not a huge city like New York City,” he said. “Plus I have a dog, and there’s lots of green space.”
 But Perez, 30, a recipient of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, has also identified long-standing local inequalities. At a tech company he previously worked for in the heart of downtown, only one of the company’s 200 employees was black, he said.
 The city’s Democratic leadership has faced pushback for being slow or failing to address issues related to race and class disparities. Over the weekend, some looked on in disbelief at Austin Mayor Steve Adler’s relative silence compared with other big city officials in regard to the protests that rocked the state.
 Adler, who was first elected in 2014, also acknowledged that “there’s a long way for Austin to go, and we have a legacy of overt racism and discrimination.”
 “The killing of George Floyd comes in a growing list of names in rapid succession — Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and our own Mike Ramos,” Adler said. “Every time that list grows, there’s yet another hit on the trust of the relationship that needs to exist between people and their police.”
 He added that the heightened emotions felt by residents of late is part of a “generations-long pain.” It’s the onus of the council and city leadership, he said, “to deal with the legacy and messages of our history.”
 On Thursday the City Council will hold a special hearing, called by Adler, for people to discuss demands from some of the city’s black activists and policing tactics used during this weekend’s protests. But the inequalities for people of color have simmered for decades.
 A long-standing east-west geographic rift shapes race and class relations. The biggest concentrations of the city’s minorities are clustered into pockets east of Interstate 35; the west side, by comparison, is mostly white. (Latinos make up 33% of Austin’s population; blacks represent 8%.)
 In the early 1900s, the racial hierarchy was plain to see in Austin. While black residents had lived throughout the city in the early part of the century, a 1928 plan approved by the City Council limited where they could live — concentrating libraries, parks and schools meant to serve black residents to the city’s east side.
 Now, experts say, there are struggling schools and a lack of affordable housing in the eastern enclaves, leaving some black residents to find refuge in cities farther north like Pflugerville and Georgetown.
 “In terms of thinking of Austin as this blue dot in a red state, it’s symptomatic of the same kind of delusion people have about northern liberal cities versus living in the South, where racism is seen to be much more entrenched,” said Minkah Makalani, an associate professor of African and African diaspora studies at the University of Texas at Austin.
 “It’s much easier to convince yourself you’re liberal when you’ve pushed so many black and brown people out and you don’t have to encounter and live with them,” he said.

Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya, who is accused of cheating Indian banks to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees, will not be extradited anytime soon as there are legal issues involved, the UK govt said on Thursday.
 Mallya is currently in the United Kingdom trying to evade extradition to India.
 "Confidential legal issue needs to be resolved before Vijay Mallya's extradition can be arranged," said UK high commission spokesperson.
 Mallya who founded the now-defunct Kingfisher airlines, fled to Britain in March 2016 after facing accusations of financial irregularities amounting to over Rs 9,000 crore. Mallya has consistently claimed that the charges he faces are baseless and fabricated and the Centre refused to take him up on his offer to clear his loans.
 Mallya' extradition to India is based on a first information report filed by the CBI in July 2015 in connection with a Rs 900 crore loan sanctioned by IDBI Bank to KFA.
 The Enforcement Directorate has charge sheeted Mallya in both cases, alleging that he diverted most of the money into foreign assets, the Indian Premier League (IPL) team and F1 motorsport firm Formula One. Mallya's assets worth Rs 13,000 crore have already been attached by ED.

 The top court said there are two aspects under consideration in this matter -- no interest payment on loans during the moratorium period and no interest to be charged on interest.

JOHANNESBURG - The Liberty Fighters Network’s (LFN) legal team is expected to meet on Thursday to come up with a plan to ensure government abided by a court judgment ordering it to amend and republish the lockdown regulations under levels 4 and 3.


  On Tuesday, the LFN won its case in the High Court in Pretoria, which found government’s lockdown regulations for levels 4 and 3 were unconstitutional and invalid.


  Government has two weeks to make the necessary changes and it was not yet clear if the State planned to appeal the judgment.


  The LFN’s president Reyno de Beer said they had not yet received any indication from government’s legal representatives about whether an appeal was on the cards.


  “We don’t know what government’s attitude is currently, but we would love for the government to utilise this opportunity to consult properly with other organisations as well,” De Beer said.


  De Beer said his organisation’s legal team would come up with a plan to ensure government kept within the court’s time frame of amending and publishing the new lockdown regulations


  However, Wits University law professor, advocate James Grant, believes the High Court ruling only applied in Gauteng as the High Court in Pretoria did not have greater jurisdiction.


  “There is another problem, judge Norman Davis sits in Gauteng and the effect of his order is restricted to Gauteng only. We are all waiting to be told what to do and what not to do, and these rulings have created some uncertainties as the regulations without the judgments were incredibly difficult to follow,” he said.


  De Beer denied that and accused Grant of trying to sow confusion among citizens.

“Some top national players have been training for last two weeks here. We have 16 courts spread out and about 20 India players are currently practising here. We have separate timings and sessions,” Vimal Kumar, head coach and director, PPBA told _PTI_.


  “Most of the trainees out of the total 65 are currently not in the city but they are very keen to come and start training,” he added.


  Vimal said training is optional at this stage.


  “We have sent out a mail that they should come in batches of 6 or 10 as they have to go through two weeks of home quarantine.


  “People coming from Maharashtra need to go through institutional quarantine so we have asked them to avoid that. We are not forcing anyone to come.”


  The players who are currently training include doubles exponent Ashwini, a three-time Commonwealth Games medallist, former world no 13 Ajay Jayaram, and Lakshya, who had a stellar season with five titles last year.


  Besides, India regulars Mithun Manjunath, BM Rahul Bharadwaj and Maisnam Meiraba are also training there.


  The former India coach said being away from the game for such a long time has likely affected the sharpness of the top players and they will need around six weeks to get going.


  “For the elite players, it will be very tough for them because in these 2-3 months, they must have lost 30-40 per cent of their sharpness, the overall level would have dropped. It will take them a month and a half to get back into good shape,” he said.


  Vimal said initially the players will be focusing on endurance and working on their reflexes.


  “The players have been following fitness programs so they are not totally unfit but badminton involves a lot of skill so their reflexes can go down due to the lockdown. So they will be building on physical strength and endurance,” he said.


  “There are no tournaments in sight right now but they have to train presuming that they can play in September. It is an opportunity as you can build their base, plan systematically during this break.”


  The 57-year-old also doesn’t see Hyderabad Open Super 100 tournament happening in August but he is happy that Badminton World Federation (BWF) has come up with a revised calender with a mention of the event as it gives hope to the players.


  “I don’t see Hyderabad Open happening in August but BWF is at least trying and they have made a mention like that. It gives a lot of positivity to the players, they can look at that and prepare but whether the event will happen, it depends on a lot of factors,” he said.


  Asked what are the safety protocols that are in place at PPBA, which is within the Padukone-Dravid Centre of Excellence, Vimal said he doesn’t believe in too much policing but they have taken certain measures.


  “When they come, their temperatures are taken at the gate. We don’t allow any visitors, so everything is fine, it is just that the swimming pools and gyms are not accessible right now,” he said.


  “But we don’t want to be policing our players. I keep telling the youngsters to take the responsibility to take care of themselves, not to mix with anyone. They have all been given instructions to maintain the best hygiene and get on with it. “I have told them clearly if one gets cold or falls sick, whole program gets stalled, so all have to be responsible.”


  Vimal also feels sports shouldn’t be clubbed with recreation.


  “In India, sports in not a priority, it doesn’t get a mention anywhere. It shouldn’t be combined with recreation. Sportspeople have responsibility, health really matters in sports, they are responsible and they can take care, so they have to be allowed,” he said.

Take the opening to Chapter LXVIII. In the ﬁrst sentence, Brás lets us know that he was strolling through a place called Valongo. What he does not tell us—in part because he doesn’t need to, given the dark familiarity of the name for Rio natives, and in part because he has no inclination to make his reflections on the subject anything but glancing—is that the Valongo was the city’s old slave market. By the time of the scene in the novel, the Americas’ largest slaving port, which alone may have received as many as a million enslaved Africans (nearly triple the total number brought to the United States), had been officially deactivated; but Machado would recall smuggled slaves being sold in broad daylight, years after the ban. Shortly after Brás’s stroll, in 1843, the Valongo wharf was chosen as the site to welcome Emperor Pedro II’s bride and renamed the “Empress’s Landing,” its irregular cobblestones covered over with even flagstones. After the monarchy fell, the area was used as a landfill. Only in the first decades of this century, thanks to the excavations prompted by the World Cup and the Olympics, did parts of the old slave wharf see the light again. Not too far off is the site of the Cemitério dos Pretos Novos, the common grave of tens of thousands of newly arrived Africans who succumbed even before they could be sold.

Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya, who is accused of cheating Indian banks to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees, will not be extradited anytime soon as there are legal issues involved, the UK govt said on Thursday.
 Mallya is currently in the United Kingdom trying to evade extradition to India.
 "Confidential legal issue needs to be resolved before Vijay Mallya's extradition can be arranged," said UK high commission spokesperson.
 Mallya who founded the now-defunct Kingfisher airlines, fled to Britain in March 2016 after facing accusations of financial irregularities amounting to over Rs 9,000 crore. Mallya has consistently claimed that the charges he faces are baseless and fabricated and the Centre refused to take him up on his offer to clear his loans.
   
   
 Mallya' extradition to India is based on a first information report filed by the CBI in July 2015 in connection with a Rs 900 crore loan sanctioned by IDBI Bank to KFA.
 The Enforcement Directorate has charge sheeted Mallya in both cases, alleging that he diverted most of the money into foreign assets, the Indian Premier League (IPL) team and F1 motorsport firm Formula One. Mallya's assets worth Rs 13,000 crore have already been attached by ED.

A former Canadian Alliance leader and Conservative MP has resigned from Telus' board of directors and as a strategic adviser to a law firm after comparing racism to his experience of being mocked in school for wearing glasses.
 Stockwell Day made the comments during a panel on CBC's "Power & Politics" Tuesday.
 Day had said on the show that he knew "for a fact" that most Canadians including his relatives, friends, and opponents are not racist.
 Telus said Day's comments "are not reflective of the values and beliefs" of the organization.
 McMillan LLP, a law firm with offices in four Canadian cities, also announced Day's resignation Wednesday in a statement.
 CBC says Day has also stepped down from his role as a commentator.
 "Should we all be more sensitive about any kind of hurting or insulting people whether it's racist or not?" Day said on the show.
 "Should I have gone through school and been mocked because I had glasses and was called 'four eyes' … should I have been mocked for all that? No, of course not. But are Canadians largely and majority racist? No, we are not."
 Day apologized for his comments on Twitter on Wednesday.
 "By feedback from many in the Black and other communities I realize my comments in debate on Power and Politics were insensitive and hurtful," Day wrote.
 "I ask forgiveness for wrongly equating my experiences to theirs. I commit to them my unending efforts to fight racism in all its forms."
 In its statement, McMillan LLP said "At McMillan LLP, we believe that systemic racism is real and that it can only be addressed when each of us -- as individuals and organizations -- commits to meaningful change. Yesterday, Stockwell Day made comments during a televised interview that run counter to this view."

  The secretary of state also rejected a call from the assembly for the government to extend its Brexit timetable.


  The UK is due to leave the current transitional phase at the end of this year, whether or not trade talks with the EU prove successful.


  On Tuesday, a majority of MLAs backed an SDLP motion which, in light of the Covid crisis and the unique impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland, asked the government to request "an extension of the current Brexit transition period beyond 31 December 2020 in order that businesses have adequate time to prepare for the implementation of new arrangements".


  But Mr Lewis said the government would not be extending the Brexit timetable, arguing such a move could have an adverse impact on the UK's trade talks, removing the impetus for the negotiators to come to an agreement on a free trade deal.


  The secretary of state said the government had been given a very clear mandate at the general election and it was important ministers stick to the task.


  He said the UK has now left the EU and needs to get on with being a sovereign nation which can trade with others around the world.

HONG KONG/LONDON -- Senior British politicians criticized HSBC and Standard Chartered on Thursday after the banks backed China's national security law for Hong Kong, in conflict with the British government's opposition to the proposed legislation.


  In a break from their usual policy of political neutrality, the British banks on Wednesday expressed support for the law even as it drew global condemnation, including from Britain, and revived anti-government demonstrations in the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong.


  Shares in HSBC, which is Britain's biggest bank, fell 1% in London, paring earlier gains in its Hong-Kong listed stocks while Standard Chartered rose slightly in London against a 1.2% drop in the FTSE 350 banks index.


  "I wonder why HSBC and StanChart are choosing to back an authoritarian state's repression of liberties and undermining of the rule of law," Tom Tugendhat, Conservative Party member and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee tweeted.


  People who said they are HSBC customers posted on social media that they will close their accounts in response to HSBC's backing of Beijing.


  HSBC and StanChart declined to comment.


  The reaction highlighted the predicament facing the two banks, based in Britain but with deep roots in China where they are trying to expand when the country's ruling party is clashing with Britain and the United States.


  Hong Kong accounted for 90% of HSBC's pre-tax profit and 41% of StanChart's in 2019, showing the importance of the Asian financial hub to the banks' bottom line.


  "The investment case for HSBC is clouded by the outlook for Hong Kong and steps by China to impose greater control over the autonomous region," said Will Howlett, equity analyst at HSBC shareholder Quilter Cheviot.


  The Global Times, which is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, said that HSBC's move should have come earlier.


  Some of HSBC's corporate peers including Cathay Pacific Airways have faced retribution from Beijing for perceived support for the anti-government protesters.


  HSBC backing comes after former Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying on Friday criticized the bank for not making its "stance" clear on the law and said that its China business could be "replaced overnight" by banks from China and other countries.


  The United States, Australia and Canada have all criticized China for imposing the law on the former British colony.


  Some employees of HSBC and StanChart noted that the business imperative was likely the reason for the support.


  "The reason for the statement is white terror, forced action to protect the bank's business," Wong, an HSBC staffer in Hong Kong who declined to give his full name, told Reuters.


  "When (these) two banks started to take a stand, it will be no surprise that other banks will start to follow suit."


  A StanChart employee, Tony, who also declined to give his full name, said: "The commercial sector of Hong Kong is definitely influenced by the Chinese government as we need them for our business."


  But the Hong Kong Finance General Employee Union, formed in September to bring together local financial professionals amid pro-democracy protests, has criticized the move.


  "HSBC and Standard Chartered should clarify if they are betraying Hong Kong people while most of the governments from the western world are against this evil law and supporting Hong Kong people," union Chairman Ka-Wing Kwok said.

My ﬁrst reading was pure delight: I thrilled at the narrator thumbing his nose at readers and critics alike, leaping around the events of his life, crafting and discarding metaphors in the same breath, existing in blithe contradiction. But as I revisited the book in undergraduate and graduate seminars over the years, the hilarity of that ﬁrst encounter seemed to fade away. More and more, what I saw was Brás’s bleak disregard for his fellow man in both life and death, which is as plain on the book’s face as its absurd humor. In the end, it was the process of translating the _Posthumous Memoirs_ that unveiled the darkest parts of its history—and also helped me to laugh at its jokes again.

HONG KONG -- Hong Kong passed a bill on Thursday that would criminalize disrespect of China's national anthem, a move critics see as the latest sign of Beijing's tightening grip on the semi-autonomous city.


  The move comes just days after Chinese authorities gave the green light to move ahead with a national security law, which the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada, as well as international human rights groups, say will erode freedoms in the global financial hub.


  The national anthem bill orders that primary and secondary school students in Hong Kong be taught to sing the "March of the Volunteers," along with its history and etiquette.


  It carries penalties of up to three years jail as well as fines of up to HK$50,000 ($6,450) for those who insult it. The anthem has been booed at football matches, where soccer fans have at times sang "Glory to Hong Kong," a song that has become a rallying cry for the democracy movement in the city.

  Earlier, police and firefighters entered the city's legislature after two pro-democracy lawmakers threw foul-smelling liquid to protest against the "murderous" crackdown by Chinese troops in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square 31 years ago.


  The disruption in the legislature came after pro-establishment lawmakers vetoed most amendments to the anthem bill proposed by democrats.


  Lawmakers Eddie Chu and Ray Chan rushed to the front of the chamber and splashed the reeking fluid as guards grappled with them. Police and firefighters later arrived on the scene.


  "A murderous state stinks forever. What we did today is to remind the world that we should never forgive the Chinese Communist Party for killing its own people 31 years ago," Chu said later, before he and Chan were removed from the chamber.


  Another pro-democracy lawmaker was removed later in the day.


  The vote was passed as people in Hong Kong commemorated the bloody 1989 crackdown by lighting candles across the city.


  For the first time, police have banned an annual vigil to mark the crackdown that is usually held in downtown Victoria Park, citing the coronavirus outbreak.


  Chinese authorities and the Beijing-backed government in Hong Kong say there is no threat to the city's high degree of autonomy from the proposed new security law.


  Breaking with their usual policy of political neutrality, HSBC and Standard Chartered banks gave their backing to the new law on Hong Kong on Wednesday.
