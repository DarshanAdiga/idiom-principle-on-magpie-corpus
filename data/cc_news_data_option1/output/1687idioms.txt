Paul Hutchings   July 29th,1943 - April 15th,2020   Paul Raymond Hutchings July 29,1943-April 15,2020 Paul Raymond Hutchings, 76, long time resident of Sonoma County and more recently of Seattle, Washington, passed away at Swedish Medical Center on April 15th, 2020, of COVID-19. Born on July 29th, 1943 in Arlington, Virginia, he was the son of Paul Raymond Hutchings and Lorna Mae Backey. He was preceded in death by his parents and his sister Lynn Cherry. A retired Real Estate Broker and Developer, Paul had a contemplative and authentic nature. He had a lifelong love of learning and a keen interest in philosophy and astronomy. He was comfortable being with himself and was selective about who he let into his life. When you became one of Paul's people, you knew that he cared about you deeply, celebrated your achievements and felt your sorrows. He had a way of listening without ego and helping you find your pathway. As a father he took pride in exposing his daughter to new things, giving her the tools to problem sole, think outside the box and be true to herself. He didn't care to be a leader but he often was one. He'd think of something creative or fun to do and if you wanted to join him you could. He was awed by the beauty of the national parks and hiked and bicycled through many of them. He loved to take long scenic drives while cranking up the radio to the likes of Elton John and Willie Nelson. He had an impressive collection of shark's teeth that he gathered while combing the beaches of Virginia, California, Florida and Cape Cod. In this earlier years Paul invested a great deal of time and energy to promote the protection of the Point Reyes National Seashore and the wetlands of the North Bay. He is survived by his wife Judith Hutchings, daughter Tiffany Hutchings, Megan Yount, grandson Jude, niece Laura Comer along with many more nieces and nephews.

The images were striking, the mayor had strong words and the backlash was swift.
 On Tuesday night, hundreds of Orthodox Jews gathered for a rabbi's funeral in Brooklyn, showing apparent disregard of public social distancing guidelines. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio issued a tweet in which he addressed "the Jewish community," saying "the time for warnings has passed" and announcing that the police would be arresting or issuing summonses to those who gather in large groups.
 Jewish leaders and others said the mayor used language that singled out the entire Jewish community, which by and large has complied with social distancing guidelines.
 On Wednesday, de Blasio stood by his warnings of police action against social distancing violators but expressed remorse over the tone of his tweets.
 "I regret if the way I said it in any way gave people the feeling of being treated the wrong way," he said.
 Some are questioning whether the police could have done more to stop the public procession before the crowd grew into the hundreds or thousands.
 Police Commissioner Dermot Shea acknowledged at a news conference Wednesday that members of his department were in contact with Hasidic community leaders to discuss "what to expect at that location" ahead of the funeral. That contact, he said, came "within minutes" of the rabbi's death.
 "Plans were put in place, a detail was put in place … contingency plans were put into place, a number of officers were detailed in the unlikely event that large numbers came and we thought that was a possibility," Shea said. "But absolutely I think we've been pretty consistent, Mr. Mayor … that there are to be no gatherings in New York City such as what we saw last night."
 Asked for further detail on the plans made by the police with local community leaders, a spokeswoman declined to comment beyond Shea's remarks at the news conference.
 In a statement distributed to reporters, Jacob Mertz, a spokesman for the congregation that organized the funeral, said organizers had the streets closed for the funeral to allow mourners to participate while following social distancing guidelines.
 "Unfortunately, this didn't pan out, and NYPD had to disperse the crowds," the statement said. "We shall note that everyone followed the police officers' orders and the vast majority wore masks. Yet, the confusion and chaos led to scenes of large crowds. We understand Mayor Bill de Blasio's frustration and his speaking out against the gathering. As said, we thought that the procession will be in accordance with the rules, and we apologize that it turned out otherwise."
 Mertz did not address whether the NYPD was involved in the street closures, but a City Hall spokeswoman told the New York Post on Wednesday that no permits were issued for the funeral.
 David Greenfield, a former City Council member and CEO of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, said in a tweet that the police "wanted to work with the chasidic synagogue out of respect for their revered (and well-known) late Rabbi so they literally barricaded streets for this 'socially distant funeral.'"
 "The Chasidic synagogue wanted to honor their saintly rabbi so they came up with a misguided scheme for an outdoor 'socially distant' public funeral. They were so convinced they could pull this off they COORDINATED with NYPD and even handed out masks."
 One Twitter account called Satmar Headquarters, but not known to be affiliated with any official organ of the Satmar Hasidic community in Williamsburg, said police had approved the funeral and helped coordinate the procession.
 "This Funeral was originally approved and actually organized by @NYPDnews 2 hours b4 it started, PD brought trucks with barriers/tower lights to close off Bedford Avenue and the surrounding area. It's the @NYCMayor's Dept who originally approved it before deciding to take it back," the tweet said.
 Videos posted to Twitter showed police telling mourners over a loudspeaker to move off the street and onto the sidewalk.
 "Everybody go home, it is finished, there's going to be traffic coming down the street," a police officer said in one video posted by Reuven Blau, a reporter for the local outlet The City.
 Another video posted by Blau showed police barriers in the background, suggesting that officers had helped close off the street for the funeral.
 The evening funeral, which was organized hastily in accordance with Jewish custom after Rabbi Chaim Mertz died on Tuesday afternoon, was publicized in a poster made by the rabbi's synagogue, Tolath Yaakov.
 The poster included a map of the funeral route on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg and advised mourners that anyone attending the funeral must wear a mask and stay 6 feet apart from others. The directive to wear masks was repeated by the Williamsburg Shomrim, a local patrol group run by Hasidic Jews, though videos from the scene clearly show some people without masks and within the proscribed 6 feet.
 "Everyone on the street should have a mask," a Shomrim member said in a video from before the funeral.

El estudio recoge que Facebook incrementó su tráfico un 100 % en llamadas de voz y el 50 % en mensajes de texto a través de WhatsApp, mientras que en algunos países, como Italia, las llamadas grupales se multiplicaron por diez.
 La OCDE recuerda que algunos proveedores de contenidos, como Netflix, Akamai y YouTube, acordaron reducir la calidad de transmisión en horas punta en Europa para no saturar la red y otros cambiaron la configuración predeterminada de alta definición a definición estándar a nivel mundial.
 Pese a ello, los operadores de telecomunicaciones indicaron que las redes han mantenido sus servicios de banda ancha 'al hacer un uso más eficiente de la capacidad existente o agregar nueva'.
 En ese sentido, la OCDE recomienda que las restricciones de movilidad ligadas al confinamiento no afecten a los ingenieros que efectúan labores de mantenimiento o reparación de los centros de datos o las infraestructuras críticas, al igual que en domicilios.
 También pide que se garanticen los suministros de equipamiento informático, en particular en aquellos lugares en los que se han cerrado las fronteras.
 Para aliviar las redes móviles, la organización recomienda liberal temporalmente espectro adicional o aprobar transacciones temporales entre proveedores.
 También pone sobre la mesa la utilidad de reducir cargas administrativas para que los operadores puedan desplegar redes de forma más rápida. EFE

Singapore has extensively traced the close contacts of each person infected with the coronavirus and released detailed information about clusters of cases. An analysis of the data shows how the virus has spread rapidly among migrant worker dormitories.
 Many migrant workers live in packed dormitories on the outskirts of the city. These dormitories can house up to 20 people per room, making it almost impossible to follow social distancing guidelines. Migrant workers around the world have been among the most vulnerable groups affected by the pandemic.
 The government has directed all labourers living in dormitories to stop working until Monday, imposing a stay-at-home order for 180,000 foreign workers in the construction sector. The government has also declared 25 dormitories as isolation areas, where workers are confined to their rooms.
 Transient Workers Count Too, an advocacy group for migrant workers in Singapore, criticised the government’s plan to quarantine such a large population together. The group compared the lockdown with situations on cruise ships in which cases multiplied uncontrollably even when passengers were kept to their rooms.
 The Singapore government requires a minimum of 48 square feet of living space for each worker.
 S11, a dormitory with the largest cluster of the coronavirus in Singapore, houses more than 2,200 people who are infected. The dormitory has a capacity of more than 10,000.
 Singapore Health Ministry officials suspect that Mustafa Center, a 400,000-square-foot mall, is the starting point for the infections at the dormitories. The shopping centre is popular among migrant workers, local residents and tourists.
 Some of the cases in dormitories have also been linked to construction sites where migrants with the virus worked. The biggest construction site cluster is Project Glory, a 51-story office tower in the downtown business area. It is linked to at least six dormitories.
 More than 20% of the 5.7 million people who live in Singapore are foreign workers, a vast majority of whom are low-wage labourers with work permits. Many of these migrants come from Bangladesh and India, and they work in construction, shipping, manufacturing and domestic service sectors. The breakdown of nationalities among the confirmed cases shows that workers from these countries have been disproportionately affected.
 Migrant workers in Singapore have long struggled with a lack of medical care. A charity that provides subsidised health care for workers suggested that this problem was especially acute during the coronavirus outbreak and may have contributed to the explosion of cases among migrant workers.

A slap across the face.
 A punch to the gut.
 A swift kick to the … well you get the point. That's pretty much how coaches and student-athletes from across the state described their feelings when the news came down Monday that the high school spring sports season would be canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The MIAA Board of Directors officially put the final nail in the coffin Friday afternoon when they voted unanimously to cancel the spring sports. The start of the season had been contingent on schools getting back in session on May 4 but that went on the door Monday when Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker mandated that schools continue using only remote learning for the rest of the school year.
 "I was heartbroken for the players, especially the seniors. They put in so much hard work and energy to get ready for their final year and to get it taken away from them just guts you as a coach," Plymouth North Softball Head Coach Sue Harrison said. "The seniors on this team have been playing together since they were eight-years-old and unfortunately they're not going to have the chance to have their last hurrah. It's tough on the juniors, too, because this is their season to get noticed by the colleges if they want to play at that level."
 Harrison believed her team was on the verge of a great season despite the graduation loss of Patriot League MVP and four-year starting shortstop Jenna Crowell.
 "I could already sense a real cohesion with this team. They'd meshed together very well and there was some real talent on the roster," Harrison said. "I think there's one senior in this group (pitcher Shea Tavakalian) that plans to play in the college so the rest of the seniors probably played their final softball game last season without being aware of it."
 Lacrosse continues to be as huge as ever in the town of Hingham. The Notre Dame Academy girls squad and the Hingham High boys team expected to compete for a state championship once again in the spring of 2021. Coaches from both teams expressed sympathy for this year's seniors missing out on a potential run for a state championship.
 "That's the most difficult part - the seniors," said Meredith Frank, who coached NDA-Hingham to the Div. 1 girls lacrosse state championship last year, and expected six seniors back to attempt to defend the title. "Everybody waits for their senior season to be the leaders, to have your own team, to sort of put your own mark on the culture of their program. And they just don't have that opportunity now."
 "It just feels really terrible," said John Todd, Hingham High's boys lacrosse coach, who anticipated contending for a state crown with a roster that featured 16 seniors. "My heart goes out, especially to the seniors. This was their time.
 "There was some thinking that they were going to tack on another two weeks somehow," Todd said. "So it was a little bit of a shock to hear that it's simply over. Everyone was holding out some hope, and now it's just really sad. For some kids, this was their last chance to ever put on a uniform."
 Plymouth South Baseball Head Coach Walt Fust took to Facebook to address the situation with his players.
 "I speak for the coaching staff when I say that we are extremely proud of what you have done for the baseball program at Plymouth South," Fust said. "Each and every one of you helped to establish a standard of hard work and respect for the game of baseball. Your leadership and hard work has set the example for the younger players and this will help us continue to build a winning tradition in the program. We cannot thank you enough for everything that you have done and this program is in a better place because of all of you."
 Given a couple days to digest this bitter pill, several graduating seniors said they were heartbroken, but understanding, about missing all the joys that go along with their final high school season.
 "I was pretty stunned," said Winston Southworth, senior captain of the Hingham baseball team. "I was still holding out a small glimmer of hope that we could get in at least a partial season, but with what's going on with the coronavirus right now, it's understandable that the decision was made to cancel the season."
 Southworth, who will play baseball at Endicott College next year, admits he greatly misses "being with the team every day. I've played with a lot of my teammates since we were seven or eight and it's said that we won't be able to have memories of that final senior season together."
 Plymouth South senior and softball captain Hannah Masterson attempted to put into words what high school sports has meant to her.
 "I played field hockey as well as softball and when I came up to the high school as a freshman playing on the field hockey team was huge in getting me acquainted with everything," Masterson said. "I made new friends and started feeling comfortable at the high school by playing on a sports team. I'll never forget how much playing high school sport meant to me. I already miss it so much.
 "I had so many great times with the girls. My teammates were like family to me."
 Masterson was a Patriot League All-Star in both field hockey and softball. She'll continue her softball career at Colby College in the fall.
 "Unfortunately my final high school softball game will be the loss to Fairhaven in the Division 2 South semifinals," Masterson said. "The seniors were ready to come back this season and avenge that loss but we won't get that chance."
 Plymouth North senior Sarah Burt was equally gutted by the loss of her final lacrosse season.
 "I was holding out some hope that we would find a way to get the season going," said Burt, who is undecided if she will play volleyball or lacrosse in college. "We had a really close-knit team coming back this season so I was really looking forward to ending my high school career with a great final season."

With more than 95,000 medical cannabis patients in the state, Maryland has deemed dispensaries as essential businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and temporarily loosened some restrictions regarding their operations. In Southern Maryland, several facilities are working toward ensuring accessibility to those they serve.
 On March 16, several days after Gov. Larry Hogan (R) announced a series of major actions to protect public health and limit the spread of COVID-19, the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission issued a temporary order changing certain rules related to dispensary operations. Deli-style sales and “sniff jars” are prohibited, but on-site deliveries are now allowed in dispensary parking lots, according to the order.
 In addition, requirements for a patient’s signature at pickup have been suspended, and orders can be processed online with confirmation of identity. The commission also set guidelines for social distancing among patients and employees and calls for frequent sanitization of the stores.
 GreenWave Medical Cannabis Dispensary in Solomons has been taking advantage of some of the new rules, allowing them to continue serving the community.
 Lauren Simpson, director of GreenWave, said they tried out curbside service to limit the number of people coming into the shop but it proved to be “inefficient and cumbersome.” To remedy that issue, staff set up a drive-thru service, “which the state approved very quickly.”
 The building the dispensary is currently occupying was once home to a bank, so a drive-thru window was already part of the building’s structure.
 Simpson said, “with a little work,” the existing window was able to be used for the facility’s distribution while the community continues to practice social distancing.
 She noticed people were “definitely panic-buying” in the beginning of the crisis when nobody was 100% certain dispensaries would be deemed essential. At first, the shop experienced about a 30% increase in sales, she said, but now business has become more steady.
 While marijuana “flower supply is good” for now, there have been some issues with keeping concentrates in stock since “big suppliers are having staffing issues,” Simpson claimed.
 She said within the past month, there has been a significant uptick in new patients, as well, while people are stuck at home with nothing else to do and many are dealing with additional anxiety or stress related to COVID-19. According to Simpson, the medical cannabis commission has allowed virtual health assessments to take place for new patients.
 The dispensary’s hours altered slightly to close an hour earlier than usual, although this Friday, May 1, the store plans to resume its normal hours.
 “The MMCC has shown great leadership,” Simpson said. “Maryland was very proactive” with ensuring accessibility to patients during the pandemic and have even began fast-tracking caregiver applications.
 “We’re lucky to have a governor who acknowledged the importance of medical cannabis to state constituents,” she said.
 Seth Erlin is the owner of Chesapeake Apothecary Medical Cannabis Dispensary in White Plains. He told the Maryland Independent last Thursday, “We are happy we are considered essential,” as he believes they are “essential in the hearts and minds” of many people.
 The shop owner said he saw an increase in sales since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and mentioned there is some concern with being able to maintain their supply.
 “There’s usually a shortage in the fall already … with the finite licenses in the supply chain," he said. “We’re doing our best to keep up and manage the craziness of everything.”
 The dispensary has been operating mostly through curbside pickup the past two weeks, and since they are situated in a stand-alone building versus being located on a busy strip mall, there are “no hindrances,” Erlin said.
 While waiting for “normalcy to come back,” he said Chesapeake Apothecary staff have been making wellness calls to check up on patients and posting updates online.
 With a patient pool of over 5,000, the dispensary’s priority is providing accessibility to patients in their time of need. They serve people with “every diagnosable illness and ailment under the sun,” Erlin said, including post traumatic stress disorder, fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression, cancer, Crohn’s disease, colitis, tremors, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and more.
 Through the versatility and adaptability of the staff, the facility has been able to maintain operations and “manage anxieties,” he said.
 Located off Three Notch Road in Mechanicsville, Southern Maryland Relief, owned by Charlie Mattingly, has changed some of its operating hours and procedures.
 On Monday, Mattingly told the Maryland Independent the dispensary has been offering curb side pickup and has been taking online orders during the pandemic, although, 50% of their customers are patients over the age of 60, and some are not quite internet savvy and would rather “come in and talk.”
 Patients are still allowed in the store on a limited basis, he said, with only six people allowed in the waiting room at one time and three in the showroom where sales take place, which usually can serve up to seven people at once. Mattingly said a security guard stands by the entrance of the store and hands every person walking in a pair of gloves, which are disposed of at the end of the visit. Masks are also provided to patients who don’t have one.
 “We sanitize every 30 minutes … we’re doing more than what was asked. It’s better to be safe than sorry,” he said.
 Mattingly, too, has a concern with supply and demand, he said, as business has increased about 40% since the pandemic began. “I wouldn’t say people are panic buying but they are stocking up on certain varieties” that work for their treatment plan.
 His concern lies in the possibility of not being able to provide a patient with the specific strain or product they’re used to, which would mean they would have to start over as far as finding out what works best for them.
 “Medical cannabis is one of the greatest things … it changes people’s lives,” he said. It treats an endless number of conditions and “really helps lift depression,” especially now that people are going “stir crazy.”
 He said some people have begun reaching out to him and asking questions about how medical cannabis might benefit them. “At the end of the day, I think when the smoke clears, this is helping people understand what is available,” the owner said, and is helping rid the community of the negative stigma that comes along with the use of medical cannabis.
 Last week, it was reported reported 33 states allow for some form of sale and consumption of marijuana and of those, more than 20 states have designated the cannabis industry as essential during the coronavirus outbreak.

WEST JEFFERSON — The West Jefferson Planning Board met via Zoom video call Tuesday, April 28, discussing the rezoning of multiple plots and changes to zoning ordinances.
 After approving the minutes from the last planning board meeting on Feb. 11, the board looked at rezoning two parcels located on Library Drive. The board unanimously approved the change from the community shopping designation to medium residential.
 Next, the board looked at the first of three text amendment on the table for the community shopping designation. A ruling on short term rentals had yet to be added to community shopping, and the board opted to add it due to one resident’s desire to add Air B&B spots to the town.
 Second were designations on food trucks. Town Manager Brantley Price noted that food trucks had never previously been touched on in the town’s laws, and multiple have started to arrive in West Jefferson. Price said the only notable complaints they have heard about food trucks has been customers parking on the side of North Third Avenue. The board voted unanimously to add food trucks to the community shopping, with the condition they only be allowed on private property.
 The third and final text amendment was the permission for a CBD, or cannabidiol, testing lab. The board was responding to a request from the owner of Hemp Processing Solutions on East Second Street, who has a set up for the process in the store.
 Board Chairman John Reeves however, said that other business owners and people who live in the surrounding area have noted an odor from the process, and the board denied the amendment because of it.
 Finally, the board approved the rezoning of two other parcels, these at the intersection of Calvin Avenue and Long Street, from industrial to the medium density residential designation.
 After approving that the rulings showed consistency with the West Jefferson Land Use Plan, the meeting was adjourned.
 The planning board does not make any changes themselves, only making recommendations to the Board of Aldermen, who then decide if any ordinances will change. The next West Jefferson Board of Aldermen meeting will be Monday, May 4.

Lapierre has the potential to be a top-six center in the NHL but his lack of a high-end scoring touch could hold him back from being a legitimate top-line option. Still, his playmaking is excellent and the fact that he's so good in all three zones makes him a very viable option for a team's second-line with room to grow into a top option if he learns to shoot more.

Currently, regulatory support is available for almost every process across clinical trials such as medical report writing, manufacturing and controls (CMC), data management, regulatory chemistry, country regulatory affairs, labeling and liaison, and regulatory strategy. One of the primary benefits of outsourcing regulatory affairs is cost effectiveness. Outsourcing non-core activities to experts can help companies focus more on their marketing and research and development activities. Hence in the long run companies can benefit from optimized reimbursements, product approval, and increased market share and productivity. Spurred by these factors, the global healthcare regulatory outsourcing market is poised to exhibit strong growth over the forecast period.

In fact, he named his only daughter, Adrienne, based on the name (spelled Adrian) of Rocky’s movie wife.
 “I love Rocky and proud he’s from Philly,” said Develin, two days after announcing his retirement.
 “I’ve seen all the movies. And I realize it’s a movie, but I tried to live by the underdog character as inspiration,” added Develin. “At end of the day it was all fiction, but there’s nothing wrong with believing it can happen.”
 Well, it happened.
 Develin’s story is every bit as impressive as his fictional idol.
 Develin, who retired two days ago due to neck injuries after eight years with the New England Patriots, ended up at Brown University where he was a mechanical engineer major.
 Near graduation, he had set up a few interviews upon completing his eligibility. But despite his “unknown” status, pro football was the only goal for the then-defensive lineman.
 With a failed tryout with the Cleveland Browns and one-game career in the Arena Football League, he got a gig with the Florida Tuskers, a team coached by Jay Gruden, of the United Football League in 2010.
 There is one caveat to this game-changing career move. It was based on a lie.
 “My agent called me and said I had a tryout with a UFL team in Orlando and needed to get on a plane immediately,” said Develin, referring to the Tuskers.
 “He said, ‘Oh yeah, one other thing. They are looking for a fullback. Don’t tell them you’ve never played fullback before.’”
 He got noticed with the Huskers and it earned him about 14 months on the Cincinnati Bengals practice squad before being released just before the 2012 season.
 Two days later, the unknown was signed to the Patriots practice squad. Belichick must’ve liked what he saw, because after two practices the other fullback on the practice squad, Eric Kettani, was released.
 He only got into one game in mid-December in 2012, but he took a lot of mental notes.
 “There was definitely something different about the Patriots,” said Develin. “It struck me how focused everyone, from Tom Brady on down, on winning and only winning. You hear it thrown around all of the time, ‘put the team first,’ but it felt like they really meant it in New England.”
 There was another message that hit home and made him realize he could do this in the NFL.
 “The Patriots live by a code, that it doesn’t matter where you come from, the college, the draft ... it doesn’t matter. It’s how you perform. That was empowering for me. I knew that I would get a chance, but that I had to perform.”
 While missing the entire 2015 season after tearing the ACL in his right leg, he didn’t miss a regular season or playoff game the other five seasons, establishing himself as not only the No. 1 fullback on the Patriots but maybe the best in the league.
 He was among the top 3 fullbacks voted to the Pro Bowl four times. In 2017, he was voted to his first and only Pro Bowl.
 But his greatest moment, or really his greatest run, began in late December of 2018 and went through early February.
 After consecutive tough road losses to Miami (the Miami Miracle) and Pittsburgh, the Patriots, 9-5 at the time, were struggling with their identity.
 “Up until that point, our running game wasn’t what it should have been,” recalled Develin. “We tried to run the ball, but never got it going. But something clicked in those last two games against the Bills and Jets. We got some momentum.”
 The Patriots rushed for 273 yards in the 24-12 win over the Bills and 131 yards in the 38-3 laugher over the Jets.
