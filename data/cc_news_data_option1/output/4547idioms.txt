“The Asian American community can coalesce in this,” Kalvoda said. “We don’t all have to be Indian American to celebrate that she’s an Asian American and an immigrant.”
 Faraja Isingo brought his 9-year-old daughter, Fortney, to the White House Saturday evening to celebrate the historic moment. Isingo was born in Nebraska, grew up in Tanzania and returned to the United States when he was 12.
 “First of all, I’ve come here and brought my daughter to witness this special event in her lifetime, Kamala and Biden,” Faraja said. “We are just so excited to witness the first Black woman elected as vice president, with her father from Jamaica and her mother India.”
 Fortney wore sparkly white boots with fuzzy trim and held two sunflowers. She looked down at the White House from atop her father’s shoulders. She peered over the tall fence surrounding that seat of power.

“She just exploded on the scene last year,” Fick said. “She did a phenomenal job as a captain this year. It was a unique trip.”
 With a luckier bounce or two, the postgame mood for Wilson could have been considerably different. The Bulldogs had a chance to take down Cumberland Valley.
 Wilson (14-2) carried play for stretches and had a shot at a vacated net with 30 minutes left. The potential tying goal barely rolled wide.
 “We couldn’t be more proud,” Fick said. “They stood toe to toe with Cumberland Valley. It’s always hard to play them because the name gets here before the team. They have a tradition.”
 Cumberland Valley (13-1) will face Central Dauphin for the title Tuesday. The Eagles are seeking their 16th championship in their 21st appearance in the final.
 Wilson lost in the semifinals for the third consecutive season.
 “We were with them every step of the game,” Fox said. “I think we came out a little weak. But as the game progressed, we definitely picked it up. That was the best game we played all year. You can’t really argue with that.”
 Fox was one of the last players to leave the field Saturday. Although she’ll be back on this turf for lacrosse in the spring, it was sad to know her soccer career had ended.
 These past two seasons brought lifetime memories.
 “It has been such an honor to play with the girls,” Fox said. “We have such a close relationship with each other. Just the fact it was my last time playing with them, it hit close to home.”

Asked in September when he became aware of the phrase, Wilson noted that Daniel Mogg, who is the chief creative officer for Wilson's production company, had told him about it.
 "Listen, at the end of the day, I just want to win," Wilson said. "Whatever it takes to win. I think I can definitely help us win, that's for sure, but it's not just me, it's so many great players. We can do it in so many different ways, and to be explosive offensively running the ball, throwing the ball, throwing it deep, throwing it midrange, throwing it short, doing all the different things. We want to be versatile, and we can definitely do all those things. So for us, I think that's really part of the recipe, I guess you could say of doing it all."

TAUNTON -- It's been a rough year for 2 Jerks Kitchen and Bar in Raynham. On top of dealing with an unprecedented pandemic like every other restaurant, they suffered a fire in May that burnt their back dining room.


  But, they hope, the end is in sight. The local barbecue joint plans to open in the next few weeks after about six months of renovations.


  "Before the virus said everything was going fantastic. We were doing really well," said co-owner Chris DePalma. "Business was on the up, as it has been every year since we've opened."


  Even when DePalma and his brother and co-owner John DePalma had to move to just takeout, he said they felt they were doing modestly well, making 40 percent of their normal revenue on just takeout.


  "We had a really great local following," he said. "Barbecue is few and far between. There's only so many places you can go. So having that little niche helped us stay busy during the pandemic."


  But around 12:30 a.m. on May 7, their smoker malfunctioned and caught fire, causing a large portion of the restaurant to be unusable. So they closed down.


  "It's like someone cuts you off at the knees," DePalma said. "It's a tough pill to swallow, especially that morning when I got the phone call from my brother about the fire. It's like your heart just sinks, pit in your stomach. I'm driving there and not knowing what to expect. And it's just this 'What do we do now? Are we gonna survive this with the rate of restaurants that were already closing with the pandemic?' And then you factor in a disaster of sorts to the mix."


  In a stroke of luck, the restaurant was given the opportunity to start operating out of the Easton Country Club in early June, and began renovations later that month. The brothers took over the upper patio of the clubhouse overlooking the golf course and set up a heated tent when the weather got colder.


  "Being a country club, they rely on weddings and events and stuff of that nature. And with the restrictions, they were unable to do so," DePalma said. "They invited us in and we were both in a need and it just worked out great to have that partnership turn out for us this summer."


  But it took some getting used to, DePalma said. In Raynham, he said, they were always busy. But now they had to inform all their customers that they had moved.


  Still, he said, there was a steady stream of customers once golf courses reopened. Golf being one of the few recreational activities allowed to operate, it remained popular throughout the summer and helped them stay afloat.


  But now the DePalma brothers are getting ready to reopen. Chris said they revamped the portion of their restaurant that was burned, turning their back dining room into a Texas roadside-style market. Though they lost 11 tables doing so, Chris said they are confident that takeout will remain dominant for months to come, and the market will help them capitalize on that.


  "When the pandemic did hit, we saw how important takeout was and how, for a while, until this is all said and done, there's still going to be people out there that remain timid about dining in," he said. "But they still gotta eat, and if they want barbecue, they can still get it without having to be around other people."


  Customers may get excited when they see the new marketplace. DePalma said they went for a retro Texas gas station look, with artwork paying homage to Route 66 and Texaco and the like.


  But 2 Jerks fans in Easton won't be disappointed either. The restaurant plans to keep operating out of the country club even after they open up. DePalma said they changed their menu there, offering more classic Americana dishes and pub fare as well as barbecue, and they don't want to lose that either.


  All in all, DePalma said 2 Jerks is "cautiously optimistic" about the future, and hopes to come back stronger than ever.

Whenever they took the floor against Cal State Bakersfield, Chris Crevelone knew his teams were in for a grueling night.


  "When we played (CSUB), you knew you were in a for a fight," said Crevelone, who spent the previous seven seasons coaching against CSUB twice a year as an assistant men's basketball coach at Grand Canyon. "Our teams had to come prepared because it was going to be a physical, tough game. We respected them a lot."


  The hard-nosed, defensive-minded approach brought to CSUB by coach Rod Barnes reminded Crevelone of another Barnes, his former boss at the University of Texas Rick Barnes.


  Before arriving at GCU, Crevelone spent four years as a video coordinator at Texas, his duties ranging from compiling scouting reports to assisting prospects on recruiting visits.


  His ability to bond with prospective players were sharpened in seven years at GCU, where he served as one of the top recruiters on the staff.


  His work quickly helped the Antelopes, who moved from Division II to Division I in Crevelone's first season in 2013-14, become a viable mid-major program. In just their third D-I season, the 'Lopes won 27 games, the first of four- consecutive 20-win seasons.


  But after a disappointing 13-17 finish in 2019-20, he was among the assistants who were let go following the March dismissal of head coach Dan Majerle.


  Luckily for him, in an offseason with minimal coaching turnover, he eventually found a landing spot with a program he knows quite well.


  When longtime CSUB assistant Jeff Conarroe left to take a head coaching job at Colorado College in May, Crevelone says he immediately reached out to Rod Barnes, and the duo expressed mutual interest in working together.


  The process was anything but speedy, as COVID-19 restrictions prevented the two sides from meeting face-to-face. But eventually, the weeks of waiting proved worth it, as Crevelone was named to the Roadrunner staff on Thursday.


  "It was super exciting," Crevelone said. "There wasn't a lot of coaching changes, so to be able to land a job during this time was very relieving."


  His presence is an exciting one for Barnes, who was happy to add another veteran to his staff.


  "His basketball knowledge and experience were a big part of helping to grow the men's basketball program at Grand Canyon and I know he will make a big impact here as well," Barnes told the CSUB Athletics website.


  A major impact Crevelone is expected to have is in recruiting, where he's established a reach that extends beyond the United States.


  In all seven of Crevelone's seasons at Grand Canyon, the Antelopes had multiple international players on their roster, and had at least six in all four of their 20-win seasons.


  With a foothold now firmly established all over the globe, Crevelone thinks California sunshine and the opportunity to play for a decorated coach will make CSUB a desirable destination for players both inside and outside the U.S.


  "You go back in the last 20 years, the guys that have won the Naismith Coach of the Year, and Rod Barnes is on that list," Crevelone said of Barnes, who won the award at Ole Miss in 2001. "You can show kids that. He's been at the highest level. You can get coached by a high-major coach, but you can do so in a league where you can do well, where you can get on the court early."


  Ready for a new challenge at a school prepping to enter a new conference, Crevelone says he's ready to hit the ground running in Bakersfield.


  “I’m excited to see in this new era, what can be done," he said. "Because I think the sky’s the limit. There’s a ton of potential and I’m excited to be here.”

Norma Mnassakh was leaving her apartment in the Lebanese capital when a cloud of dust suddenly billowed from the Ottoman-era building next door.
 The abandoned home with its popular ground-floor ice cream shop had been severely damaged in the colossal August 4 explosion at the nearby Beirut port.
 Now, heavy rainfall has just about finished off the job.
 "I was born and raised here. This neighbourhood is home. I know every single piece of it," the woman in her fifties told AFP, only hours after the building partially caved in.
 "But I'm losing all the sights that I grew up with," she added, as chunks of rubble lay strewn on the sidewalk.
 Rmeil 24, in Beirut's Ashrafieh district, is among a handful of structures damaged in the blast that collapsed this week with the start of heavy rains and wind.
 At least 90 other heritage homes could bite the dust this winter, caretaker culture minister Abbas Mortada told AFP.
 The port explosion, which authorities say was caused by a huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate that caught fire, killed more than 200 people and damaged or destroyed around 70,000 homes.
 Now, the weather is worsening that destruction.
 Carla, a 52-year-old who grew up near the Rmeil 24 building, said Lebanon's history was on the line.
 "This is our heritage," she said.
 "It's such a shame for it to be lost in this way."
 \- Too little, too late -
 The Rmeil 24 building has been abandoned for more than 40 years.
 But its ground floor continued to house the Hanna Mitri ice cream shop -- one of the capital's most prized traditional parlours, beloved by tourists and locals alike.
 The Beirut gem, which has since reopened in a new location, was forced to shut after the explosion caused the shop's ceiling to crumble.
 Heavy rainfall on Thursday night accentuated the "cavities in the roof" of Rmeil 24, leading to the "partial destruction" of the building, said Yasmine Makaroun, an architect from the Association for Protecting Natural Sites and Old Buildings in Lebanon (APSAD).
 The worst could have been prevented if the landowner hadn't delayed access to the site while the weather was favourable, she told AFP.
 "We could have started the first rescue interventions... and we could probably have partially saved it," she said.
 The cash-strapped Lebanese government, which is grappling with the country's worst economic crisis in decades, is relying on foreign assistance to protect heritage buildings from collapse.
 But Western donors have pledged to bypass the government after allegations of corruption and mismanagement, instead channelling funds directly to local and international organisations spearheading the reconstruction effort.
 Caretaker culture minister Mortada said international assistance had been underwhelming.
 "We are not seeing the required level of interest... from international organisations," he told AFP.
 And "as a ministry, we have a gap in capacity," especially regarding personnel, he added.
 \- Winter wasteland -
 In the Gemmayzeh neighbourhood, just across from the port, labourers worked to remove the remains of a building where Chilean rescue workers in September thought they had detected a human heartbeat beneath the wreckage.
 The building was severely damaged in the explosion, and rains on Wednesday finished it off.
 Workers outnumbered pedestrians, who walked nervously past several buildings along the street that looked like they could collapse at any moment.
 Just over a kilometre (less than a mile) away, the working-class Karantina district adjacent to the port was already a wasteland of debris before the rain brought a building down on Wednesday -- the first such casualty to the winter weather.
 Security forces watched on as construction workers fortified the walls of another building at risk of collapse in the hard-hit neighbourhood.
 All around, the entrances to old homes were cordoned off with yellow and red tape. Signs warned people against entering.
 Staring up at a gutted building overlooking the devastated port, one Syrian refugee who asked not to be identified lamented his lost home.
 "There is nothing we can say," he told AFP.
 "We can only turn to God."

Look for that announcement as soon as next week and he might even say something about it in his speech tonight.

 This week, former Vice President Biden and and Senator Harris had a briefing with medical experts on the coronavirus. They've been having things like that all along, but even as they waited for the return. So I think you're going to see this as being something front and center in the president-elect's transition now.

That argument did not pass muster in either state or federal courts. In Nevada, the Trump campaign unsuccessfully tried to sue to halt ballot-counting in Clark County, only to appeal to the Supreme Court after a lower court rejected the claims.

MANHATTAN -- For all the issues Oklahoma State and its three-headed monster of an offense present, Kansas State coach Chris Klieman knows his Wildcats will need some help.
   
 Thus the old adage that the best defense is a good offense.
   
 "It's really challenging," Klieman said of stopping No.14-ranked Oklahoma State, which visits Bill Snyder Family Stadium at 3 p.m. Saturday with a share of the Big 12 lead on the line. "That's why we have to do a great job of what we talk about (as) complementary football.
   
 "We have to be able to stay on the field offensively and be able to churn out first downs, even if we're not maybe getting a scoring drive. We've got to be able to take four or five minutes off the clock and get some first downs, so that limits some of their opportunities."
   
 The Cowboys (4-1, 3-1 Big 12) boast a pair of All-Americans in junior running back Chuba Hubbard and senior wide receiver Tylan Wallace, and since sophomore quarterback Spencer Sanders returned from an injury two weeks ago -- he missed most of the season opener and two more games after -- they have averaged nearly 500 yards total offense.
   
 "If they're getting 100 plays, we're in trouble, and that's what they want to have," Klieman said. "So for us, we have to be able to slow down the rush. We know that.
   
 "You can't just sit in Cover 2 the whole game and let them run the football. But in the same respect, we have to pick and choose our chances when we're going to be aggressive -- maybe run blitz or whatever it may be -- because you've got some receivers on the edge that can make plays."
   
 When the Wildcats (5-1, 4-1 Big 12) have been good defensively, the formula has been simple: limit explosive plays, force turnovers and get off the field on third down. None of that happened last week in a 37-10 loss at West Virginia.
   
 Add a subpar offensive performance and the Mountaineers controlled the ball for 34 minutes.
   
 "We just couldn't get going and I think the big thing for us to try to work on is staying on the field," K-State running back Harry Trotter said after the Wildcats managed just 41 rushing yards against West Virginia. "They had a lot of time of possession today and I think that's one thing that we can learn from and just try to stay on the field more -- convert third downs and be more positive on first and second down to get to third and manageable."
   
 Last year, the Wildcats opened Big 12 play with a 26-13 road loss to Oklahoma State. Ten of their points came in the fourth quarter with the Cowboys firmly in control.
   
 On defense, the Wildcats won the turnover battle with a pair of interceptions, but little else. Hubbard went off for 296 yards, including an 84-yard touchdown, and averaged 11.8 per carry.
   
 Sanders, then a redshirt freshman, threw for just 153 yards, but 145 of them were to Wallace, who had eight catches.
   
 "Offensively, we have our hands full because they can beat you at every level in the fact that the quarterback can beat you with his arm or his feet," Klieman said. "(They have) two great running backs. One everybody knows about, but they have two really talented running backs.
   
 "At wide receiver, I think they have one of the best wide receivers in the country in (Tylan) Wallace, so we'll have our hands full trying to come up with a great plan. You can't stop them, but you have to slow them down."
   
 Hubbard ranks third in the Big 12 with 110 yards per game, but senior LD Brown has been an effective backup, averaging 52.4 yards on 5.8 yards per carry. Wallace leads the league in receiving with 35 catches for 588 yards and four touchdowns despite playing just five games.
   
 Sanders is not ranked in the league because he has appeared in just three games, but passed for 400 yards in last week's overtime 41-34 overtime loss to Texas.
   
 Before Texas lit them up for 41 points last week, the Cowboys had not allowed more than 21 in a game and they still lead the league in scoring defense at 17.8 and rank second in total defense, giving up an average of 299.8 yards.
   
 The West Virginia game was the worst of the year for K-State true freshman Will Howard, who threw three interceptions, and running back Deuce Vaughn, who was limited to 22 yards rushing and 1 receiving yard. Tight end Briley Moore, the Wildcats' most consistent receiver, also went down with a back injury late in the first half and offensive coordinator Courtney Messingham said Thursday that his availability against Oklahoma State would be a game-day decision.
   
 K-State's offense seemingly never recovered at West Virginia after failing to reach the end zone with a first and goal from the 2, settling instead for a short field goal.
   
 "The crazy part is, that was a huge emphasis last week, because a year ago I thought the reason we weren't successful against West Virginia was because they forced us to kick two field goals in the red zone," Messingham said.
   
 It remained an emphasis this week.
   
 "We need to be able to score," Klieman said. "That's been kind of where we've been the last few weeks.
   
 "We had a couple of short fields against KU and didn't get touchdowns and had to settle for field goals. The way that we're going to play and the way we need to play, is to be able to convert those into touchdowns in the red zone."

MIDDLEBORO -- As the Fireside Grille approaches its one-year anniversary under the ownership of Michael and Erin Dearing, the couple is looking forward to celebrating with the community where they grew up.
 "My wife and I actually met in the fourth grade at the Burkland School in Middleboro in 1980 and we were like the best of friends all through school. We really had a lifetime together here in Middleboro, so when we had the chance to come back home, it was really great," Michael said.
 Growing up in the restaurant industry, Michael knew it was a career he could see himself pursuing and sought for the right opportunity to return to his hometown.
 "I've had the good fortune of trying a lot of other things, but the restaurant business is like no other business. When you think about the influence that restaurants have on people's lives and special occasions, there's no substitute for that," Michael said.
 After high school, Michael continued his formal education at Johnson & Wales University.
 "Right out of college I went to work for, what was then called, ITT Sheraton," he explained, which was an international hotel chain. "Within a year, I became a food and beverage director for Sheraton, which was really a neat thing. That was my first stop right out of college."
 After spending some time developing his professional knowledge in the hotel industry, Michael spent the next decade working multiple different positions at a variety of different restaurants, a list that includes the position of general manager at the Chart House Restaurant Company in Boston, being one of the founding partners of Fleming's Steakhouse & Wine Bar, as well as the restaurant executive with both Border Cafe and Darden Restaurants, Inc.
 "I was on the road all the time," he said. "And we kind of just continued to say, 'Boy, if we're ever going to make a lifestyle change, could we come full circle and find an opportunity where we can not be on the road and be immersed in our community.' So the fact that we found an opportunity in Middleboro, it couldn't have been better."
 Michael and Erin bought Fireside Grille from the Barrett family on December of 2019. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved a few months later, they were forced to adapt and navigate through new regulations, including takeout, and eventually outdoor seating.
 "We've really had to reinvent ourselves for COVID. This property is a wonderful place, but it's never really been set up for outdoor dining or takeout," Michael said. "And we really had to learn on the fly how to adapt and put those things in place."
 The outdoor seating was a hit with the community, and looks to be a permanent addition to the Fireside Grille.
 "My wife, Erin, does a lot of the day to day operations and then our three kids work here too," Michael explains.
 Mikayla, though currently away at school, was often found hostessing or managing the takeout orders, while Derek and Dylan could be found working at the buffet and busing tables.
 "Something my dad taught me as a youngster is the culinary side of the business and how important it was to source local ingredients," Michael said. "So something that we've done is sort of revamped both the food menu and the drink menu to reflect locally sourced ingredients. We make 99 percent of what we serve."
 For their one-year anniversary on Dec. 7, the Dearings hope to partner with the community to raise donations for a charitable cause. Whoever brings in a donation will be able to pick from a unique menu that they have created just their anniversary. Though Michael and Erin haven't determined the charity they wish to donate to yet, they are excited to be giving back to the community.
 Michael says, "Something I've always believed in is take care of our customers, take care of each other, and take care of the community -- and those are the three pillars that we have built this restaurant on."

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) — Mohamed Ibrahim rushed for four touchdowns and Tanner Morgan threw for one more and Minnesota beat depleted Illinois 41-14 on Saturday. Ibrahim now has back-to-back games in which he has scored four rushing touchdowns for Minnesota (1-2, 1-2 Big Ten). Illinois (0-3, 0-3) had 12 players out due to COVID-19 protocols and was down to fourth-string QB Coran Taylor. Starter Brandon Peters and backup Isaiah Washington are out, and third-string QB Matt Robinson remains unavailable after suffering a leg injury early in the Purdue game last week. Taylor wasn’t awful, going 6 of 17 through the air for a touchdown and no interceptions. He suffered what appeared to be a hand injury on his throwing arm early in the second half but remained in the game despite obvious throwing difficulties. One bright spot for Illinois was often-injured running back Mike Epstein, who rushed for 108 yards on 11 carries with one touchdown. Illinois safety Derrick Smith was ejected in the second quarter due to a targeting penalty out of bounds, further depleting an Illini secondary already without starters Nate Hobbs and Marquez Beason, both unable to play due to COVID-19 protocols. Morgan and company took advantage. Minnesota outgained Illinois 556 to 287 yards in total offense and led 28-7 at half. The Illini’s only score before intermission came on a 1-yard run by Epstein, which was set up by his 63-yard run to the Gophers' 9-yard line. THE TAKEAWAY Morgan and Ibrahim had their way against a depleted Illinois defense and an impotent offense led by an injured fourth-string quarterback. This game was over by the end of the first quarter. UP NEXT Minnesota has an opportunity to even its Big Ten record on Friday night when it hosts Iowa, which upped its record to 1-2 after...

  # 'Tanking for Trevor' movement in full swing, even at Notre Dame Stadium


  Scott Keepfer


  Greenville News


  View Comments


  SOUTH BEND, Ind. – Included in the mix of fans awaiting the arrival of the Clemson team buses Saturday night at Notre Dame Stadium was a wayward New York Jets fan.


  Strange?


  To the contrary, such a phenomenon may become commonplace over the next few months.


  Stephen Howard, a Norwalk, Connecticut, resident, was in town to visit his brother and felt inspired to let Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence know that he wants the Jets to select Lawrence with the first pick in the NFL Draft next April.


  The Jets are the lone remaining winless team in the NFL at 0-8 and would appear to have the inside track to a last-place finish and thus the No. 1 pick in the draft.


  “I’ve been a lifelong Jets fan, unfortunately,” said Howard, who confirmed that he's well aware of the "Tanking for Trevor" movement as fans from the NFL's also-rans NFL.


  He’s also a fan of Lawrence, who is expected to turn to the pro ranks after this, his junior season, and is the odds-on favorite to be the No. 1 pick.


  “We’re going to get a high first-round pick, so I’m not complaining,” Howard said. “But I think we’re trying to lose right now on purpose.”


  That would be fine with Howard, who had Lawrence’s name handwritten across the back of his Jets jersey. His goal Saturday was to catch Lawrence’s attention as he got off the Clemson bus and entered the stadium. Howard and a group of friends yelled at Lawrence, who appeared to cast a quick glance in their direction.


  “I like Trevor,” Howard said. “He’s a fantastic quarterback, so it would be better than (Sam) Darnold. We’ll see.”

Flag-waving migrants on the Mexican-US border on Saturday welcomed Joe Biden's presidential election win and voiced hope that Donald Trump's defeat would bring greater respect for human rights.
 "We're celebrating the victory of Biden and the departure of Donald Trump," said pastor Gustavo Banda, who heads a migrant shelter in Tijuana across the frontier from San Diego in California.
 "We're hoping that this new presidency will truly respect human rights," he told AFP.
 With Biden in the White House, Banda expressed optimism that "families (who enter the United States illegally) will no longer be separated and children will no longer be caged" in US immigration facilities.
 "And that the migrants in our city achieve their hopes of a better life when they arrive in the United States," he added.
 Trump branded Mexican migrants "rapists" and drug dealers during his 2016 election campaign and vowed to build a wall along the border.
 His "zero tolerance" policy launched in 2018 saw thousands of children separated from their parents at the frontier, a tactic apparently meant to frighten the families, before the government backed down.
 Surrounded by migrants from Haiti and Central America and US flags, Banda took up a symbolic position near the border crossing where thousands of US citizens or legal residents pass each day.
 Biden supporters waved the Stars and Stripes and some motorists honked their horns in celebration.
 Around 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) to the east in Ciudad Juarez, Cuban migrant Pedro Ruiz expressed his joy at Trump's defeat.
 "I wanted Biden to win because he clearly said that he's going to restore the entire asylum system," the 51-year-old said.
 Ruiz said he left Cuba four years ago "due to political repression" and has been in a shelter in Ciudad Juarez for 19 months.
 Migrants living in the city's shelters learned about the election results by television or through their cell phones, largely isolated from the outside world due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Under an agreement between Mexico and the United States in January 2019, asylum seekers must wait in Mexico for their applications to be processed in the United States.
 Although illegal migration, mainly from Central America, has been a problem for decades, it has escalated since the end of 2018 when thousands of people headed for the United States in migrant caravans.
 The mass flight from poverty and violence forced Mexico to tighten its border controls under threat of trade sanctions from Washington.

TAUNTON -- John-Paul and Peter Thomas had always wanted to own a restaurant in the Silver City.


  Since opening Bar 88 & Grille in 2017, the Taunton brothers looked to create a place with a little flare in the city.


  But when COVID-19 closed down their establishment at 88 Wales St. in March, the duo had to start again from scratch.


  "It was up and down before the pandemic," John-Paul said. "But like everybody else when COVID-19 hit, it took the wind out of our sails. But since coming back it has been very positive."


  Now, the best-kept secret in the city is back and better than ever.


  The restaurant specializes in thin crust, flatbread brick oven pizzas made fresh daily with straight mozzarella in a wood-fired, all natural brick oven outdoors with a temperature set at over 500 degrees.


  This unique, smoky-flavored pizza has many options on the menu, including classic cheese, Caprese, Greek, BBQ chicken, Hawaiian and Mediterranean. You can also build your toppings to satisfy your taste buds.


  They also serve fresh seafood, sandwiches, burgers, appetizers and other tasty entrees. There are 10 beers on tap and they will soon feature a margarita tap.


  John-Paul said he does offer fresh-made Lebanese food but had cut back on that option on their regular menu in July due to COVID-19.


  "We get a lot of people coming in for the first time and they did not know about this place," he said. "We're here. Everybody said 'We did not realize you were here … I did not know it existed'."


  Bar 88 & Grille, which used to be called Anthony's 88, the Red Whippet, Cape Verdean Club and Esprito-Santo, reopened in July and has gone all out to keep diners safe amid COVID.


  Twelve tables on the inside are 6 feet or more apart. The bar area has partitions in place that seats two patrons only. John-Paul and his brother also built and designed one of the nicest outdoor patios in Taunton, with 14 tables set at six-feet apart or more.


  The newly renovated building, which has seven staff members, also has a lot of custom work on the interior. There are two sets of bathrooms inside and 10 televisions, including two outdoors.


  In the middle of the dining area, there is a sliding divider that allows for the creation of a function room.


  John-Paul said they host political functions, weddings, bereavement functions, birthdays, engagements and graduation commencement events


  The main sign on the front of the building was originally on the old Benjamin's on Bay Street. John-Paul had it restored and replaced it with his restaurant's name.


  He re-skinned the walls, the ceilings, redid the bar and changed the floors, which used to be vinyl and rugs. All the floors are now brand new.


  "Now I just need people to sit in the seats and enjoy the place," John-Paul said.


  Maureen Higgins, a neighbor, has been a steady customer to Bar 88 & Grille since it opened. She often helps out when needed and said the restaurant is loved by everyone who comes in.


  "I've seen it grow so much," she said "Now they just need that boost. As a neighbor, you want to support it in the worst of COVID-19. I used to be a restaurant business. I try and see the needs of the business since I was into it. [I] just try to be eyes and ears."


  Bar 88 is currently working to promote and build a website for the restaurant as well as making sure online platforms Grubhub and Doordash are tied to the eatery.


  John-Paul said he appreciates loyal customers like Higgins.


  "We have a lot of great people like Maureen and her husband that ordered food weekly along with a handful of customers," he said. "But it wasn't enough to sustain anything. Maureen has been an awesome neighbor and a good customer."


  Another feature of the restaurant is that there are one or two pieces of acoustic entertainment on Saturdays from 5 p.m.-8 p.m.


  John-Paul said he would like to expand their demographics inside.


  Although it is an adjustment sitting inside, Bar 88 has a beautiful layout to keep their customer's safe.


  John-Paul advised, "I take every precaution necessary. I don't skip out on the guidelines. I like what we have. It's comfortable and cozy. Bar 88 & Grille is where family and friends gather."


  Bar 88 & Grille will also be adding a new fall menu and will soon offer takeout and delivery.


  Due to the new COVID-19 restrictions in place, the restaurant will open Tuesday through Sunday from 3 p.m to 9 p.m. They are closed on Mondays.

Two second-half goals and a stout defensive effort led the Sunapee High School boys soccer team to a 2-0 home victory over Littleton in the NHIAA Division IV championship game on Saturday.
 The title marks Sunapee’s second in three years. The Lakers (12-2) also finished as the runner-up to Newmarket last year.
 Sunapee senior back Garrett Rumrill scored his first career goal following a corner kick by Parker Reed in the 63rd minute to open the game’s scoring.
 Lakers coach Jack Iacopino said Rumrill’s tally energized both sides.
 Littleton threw additional numbers forward and created several scoring chances in the second half but Rumrill, fellow backs Josh Heino, Andrew Claus and Maddox Cahill and senior goalkeeper Sean Moynihan (11 saves) withstood the Crusaders’ pressure to secure another shutout win. Freshman Sam Kress notched the insurance goal for Sunapee off an assist from Reed in the 73rd minute.
 “I’m very proud of the boys, this group of seniors especially,” Iacopino said. “We have a huge senior class — 12 kids on the team — and they knew what it was like (to win the title). They wanted to get back here and they did.”

BLACKSBURG — Hugh Freeze didn’t have to say much to Malik Willis the two times the quarterback walked over to the sideline after losing fumbles in the first half Saturday against Virginia Tech.
 “Those conversations were very simple: ‘Take care of the dadgum ball,’” Freeze explained. “That’s pretty much what I have to say to him.”
 Message received loud and clear.
 Willis took care of the ball in the second half and helped lead the game- winning drive in the final minute that lifted No. 25 Liberty to a thrilling 38-35 victory over the Hokies at Lane Stadium.
 “I can’t turn the ball over. That’s the whole reason the game went like it did,” Willis said. “We gave them momentum every time I dropped the football. I just tried to stay down and flush it out of my short-term memory and keep going out there and try to move the football, keep going out there and try to make the right decisions. That’s got to get handled by me first and foremost because nobody else was messing up. I was the only one dropping the football.”

Another famous incident involved outstanding female bowling great Marian Ladewig.
 “Working on a string of strikes on lane four, Steve fired another strike and went into his patented act. He jumped over the ball return between lanes four and three, hopped over the ball return between two and one, flew right off the edge of the lanes, kept on going past the aisle which ran along number one, went through the curtain which hung alongside the aisle, slammed through a door behind the curtain and almost wound up on the street outside the Coliseum. The great Marian Ladeweg, who was bowling on the lanes next to Nagy, broke up so much with laughter that she could hardly throw her ball.”
 When the network television series Championship Bowling began filming in 1954, the producers offered $1,000 to anyone who could bowl a perfect game during its telecast. In 1955 Nagy came to Chicago's Faetz-Niesen Recreation Center, where he had never bowled, to face the reigning champion of the series, Chicago bowler Eddie Kawolics, who was a regular at Faetz. Nagy rolled a few practice games, smiled, and said to announcer Joe Wilson, "This place gives you your confidence back."
 Nagy got off to a slow start, losing the first game of the match to Kowalics. In the second game, Nagy rolled nothing but strikes. In the ninth frame, he left a 10-pin, but it fell over just in time. Nagy's last roll was a strike, and he became the first player ever to roll a perfect game on national television (A clip of the 10th frame can be seen on YouTube, "Championship Bowling - Steve Nagy 300").
 Nagy bowled his 38th perfect game on the second night of the San Jose Open in 1961.
 He was one of the 33 founding members of the PBA, which he serve as president from 1963-1964. For many years he was part of the promotional staff of Brunswick, a bowling manufacturer, and conducted hundreds of clinics and exhibitions across the United States and Canada.
 Nagy is still the only bowler featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Nagy was elected to American Bowling Congress Hall of Fame, 1963.
 In 1964 Nagy had a stroke and was hospitalized for six weeks. In 1965 he suffered another stroke and passed away Nov. 11, 1966 at the age of 53. He was posthumously inducted into the Professional Bowling Association Hall of Fame in 1977.
 The PBA's annual Steve Nagy Sportsmanship Award is named in his honor.

 One is the shroud draped over the top. Normally, artists carve shrouds to depict the protection of funeral urns containing the ashes of the dead, Springer said. The other is what may be either the letter “C” or an unusual Chi Rho — a Christian symbol with Greek origins — carved into the monument’s face.
 “Over an obelisk, that’s a little strange,” Springer said. “I’m sure there is a meaning, but it’s not as common as you’d find.”

 When it comes to energy sources, Kansas isn't the luckiest of states. But it's pretty lucky.
 The state has oil, natural gas and wind. It also has crops, such as corn and milo, that can be used to produce such fuels as ethanol.
 When it comes to fossil fuels, such as oil and natural gas, Kansas is an also- ran. Its production is tiny compared to Texas and several other states.
 Texas also produces a lot more wind energy than any other state, but Kansas does rank in the top five when it comes to wind power.
 Its mix of old and renewable sources means Kansas is well situated as the world's energy markets continue to evolve.
 But whether the state actually prospers in the years ahead by optimizing its energy resources will depend on its ability to keep pace with the forces of change.
 Like so much else, energy has become another topic used to politically divide people. And as the effects of climate change have grown more apparent, those political divisions have grown wider and deeper.
 The guardians of fossil fuels are on one side. Many of them insist climate change is a hoax -- or if it is real, well, it doesn't have anything to do with anything humans are doing on the planet.
 On the other side are environmentalists. The more extreme of that crowd demand that we make major sacrifices. They want us to change what we eat, how many kids we have, what we drive and virtually every other aspect of how we live.
 Rather than pick either side, most Americans would prefer to find ways to move forward without major disruptions.
 For example, it's doubtful that Americans in any significant numbers would voluntarily give up their cars. But they would be willing to drive vehicles powered by hydrogen, electricity or other energy sources if they are affordable and the infrastructure exists to keep them up and running.
 Similarly, many of us will not agree to give up meat because environmentalists claim that cows require too much grain and produce too much methane gas. But we are interested in research that provides farmers and ranchers with the means of reducing the carbon footprint of beef and dairy operations.
 Science has tremendous potential to help us solve or at least mitigate our environmental issues. We just need to stop treating every disagreement and problem as a political or ideological battle.
 That's not to say that there won't be disruption. Change often comes with a downside for some, even as it provides opportunities to others.
 When gas-powered vehicles replaced horses, one industry declined as another grew.
 When homes started using electricity and natural gas to power furnaces, ovens and lighting systems, coal and kerosene businesses slowly but surely lost customers.
 These were, for the most part, economic transitions, not abrupt changes. And that likely will be how the energy changes we need to take place will occur.
 There will be winners and losers. There will be states, industries and businesses better prepared than others to transition to the next chapter of American energy.
 Kansans should not get bogged down in political combat or ideological warfare. Let's support research and investments that position us to benefit from the technologies being developed and the practices and policies that are being formed.

TAUNTON -- It's been a rough year for 2 Jerks Kitchen and Bar in Raynham. On top of dealing with an unprecedented pandemic like every other restaurant, they suffered a fire in May that burnt their back dining room.
 But, they hope, the end is in sight. The local barbecue joint plans to open in the next few weeks after about six months of renovations.
 "Before the virus said everything was going fantastic. We were doing really well," said co-owner Chris DePalma. "Business was on the up, as it has been every year since we've opened."
 Even when DePalma and his brother and co-owner John DePalma had to move to just takeout, he said they felt they were doing modestly well, making 40 percent of their normal revenue on just takeout.
 "We had a really great local following," he said. "Barbecue is few and far between. There's only so many places you can go. So having that little niche helped us stay busy during the pandemic."
 But around 12:30 a.m. on May 7, their smoker malfunctioned and caught fire, causing a large portion of the restaurant to be unusable. So they closed down.
 "It's like someone cuts you off at the knees," DePalma said. "It's a tough pill to swallow, especially that morning when I got the phone call from my brother about the fire. It's like your heart just sinks, pit in your stomach. I'm driving there and not knowing what to expect. And it's just this 'What do we do now? Are we gonna survive this with the rate of restaurants that were already closing with the pandemic?' And then you factor in a disaster of sorts to the mix."
 In a stroke of luck, the restaurant was given the opportunity to start operating out of the Easton Country Club in early June, and began renovations later that month. The brothers took over the upper patio of the clubhouse overlooking the golf course and set up a heated tent when the weather got colder.
 "Being a country club, they rely on weddings and events and stuff of that nature. And with the restrictions, they were unable to do so," DePalma said. "They invited us in and we were both in a need and it just worked out great to have that partnership turn out for us this summer."
 But it took some getting used to, DePalma said. In Raynham, he said, they were always busy. But now they had to inform all their customers that they had moved.
 Still, he said, there was a steady stream of customers once golf courses reopened. Golf being one of the few recreational activities allowed to operate, it remained popular throughout the summer and helped them stay afloat.
 But now the DePalma brothers are getting ready to reopen. Chris said they revamped the portion of their restaurant that was burned, turning their back dining room into a Texas roadside-style market. Though they lost 11 tables doing so, Chris said they are confident that takeout will remain dominant for months to come, and the market will help them capitalize on that.
 "When the pandemic did hit, we saw how important takeout was and how, for a while, until this is all said and done, there's still going to be people out there that remain timid about dining in," he said. "But they still gotta eat, and if they want barbecue, they can still get it without having to be around other people."
 Customers may get excited when they see the new marketplace. DePalma said they went for a retro Texas gas station look, with artwork paying homage to Route 66 and Texaco and the like.
 But 2 Jerks fans in Easton won't be disappointed either. The restaurant plans to keep operating out of the country club even after they open up. DePalma said they changed their menu there, offering more classic Americana dishes and pub fare as well as barbecue, and they don't want to lose that either.
 All in all, DePalma said 2 Jerks is "cautiously optimistic" about the future, and hopes to come back stronger than ever.

The next season of Tekken 7 begins this month. Players who bought the season pass will get access to new character Kunimitsu, also available as DLC 16. The fox-masked ninja is apparently the daughter of the original Kunimitsu from Tekken 2, although since she won't be added to the story mode it's much of a muchness.


  Season 4 also includes new stage Vermilion Gates, and a Pac-Man event tying into his 40th anniversary—though sadly they're not actually adding him as a playable character. Instead a Pac-Man stage will be available for a limited time, and owners of the season pass can also get themed cosmetics. There's a t-shirt, a customization set, and plushies of Pac-Man and the ghosts that sort of float behind your chosen fighter. Somebody's bound to be into it, I guess.


  Players who don't have the season pass will still benefit from the other changes coming with Season 4. An online play enhancement will apparently improve response time and the rollback/netcode, and an indicator will mark players on wi-fi. New moves are being added for everyone as part of a "major balance overhaul", the UI (including health bars) is getting a revamp, and a new top rank called "Tekken God Omega" as well as a Tekken Prowess score will give the best players even more to show off.


  Season 4 begins on November 10.

African Americans, who are the Democratic Party's most loyal voting bloc, face a battle for racial progress in a nation whose very founding embraced racist, predatory systems that continue to disparately harm Black people today.
 And America has yet to fully reckon with that racist past, which left generations of Black Americans struggling to achieve the American dream or to overcome the effects of Trump's election in 2016, which many experts saw as a blow to civil rights and race relations.
 "We've been here before where we've seen a country that has been deeply divided over race and the complicit role of whites who should be sympathetic to Black interests and issues due to the shared economic fate but they aren't," said Nadia Brown, a Purdue University political science professor. "People will just try to put their heads in the sand because they don't want to be culpable or deal with America's history and its present day. America was founded on the idea of American exceptionalism but structural racism flies in the face of this and even good liberals don't want to hear that."
 In 2016, a coalition composed largely of white voters powered Trump's win over then-challenger Hillary Clinton. At the time, many said they voted for Trump because of his economic plans, which included bringing back manufacturing jobs and auto plants.
 But Ashley Jardina, assistant professor of political science at Duke University and author of the book "White Identity Politics," said many white Americans supported Trump in 2016 and again in 2020 not solely because they are willing to turn a blind eye to racism, but because they outright agree with a lot of his rhetoric and views on race.
 "That means many not only fail to see racism as a problem in the U.S., but they also express greater levels of hostility toward people of color," Jardina said, noting the views of white Americans on race have increasingly aligned with their political views over the past eight years.
 The killings of Breonna Taylor, who was shot and killed inside her Kentucky home, and that of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for nearly eight minutes, sparked global protests against police brutality and thrust racism in America into an international spotlight.
 Those protesters will be looking for Biden and Harris to address their concerns and create progressive policies to address the root causes of police violence, according to Jessica Byrd, who leads the Movement for Black Lives' Electoral Justice Project, and believes Biden and Harris have demonstrated a willingness to engage with the protest movement and organizers.
 "Elections are about moving the ball forward and choosing your organizing target," Byrd said, adding the movement will pivot toward pushing for legislation and policies like the BREATHE Act, which would transform the nation's criminal justice system and invest in communities. "We fully intend to show up in the really important days between November and the inauguration and demonstrate our vision for Black lives is real. We have demands of the first 100 days of a Biden-Harris administration."
 Some activists on the ground remain skeptical. In Philadelphia, protests flared in recent days after police shot and killed 27-year-old Walter Wallace Jr.
 Longtime activist Abdul-Aliy Muhammad is concerned Biden and Harris won't address the root causes of police brutality, poverty and other structural issues that have long plagued Philadelphia.
 "Biden nor Kamala Harris historically have policies that positively impact Black Philadelphians," Muhammad said. "We know with Biden or Kamala Harris in office, we're still going to need to organize and we're going to still have to fight for our material conditions to shift."
 Biden's election also represents hope with the historic candidacy of Harris, who will become the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent, to enter the White House--which some believe will create a ripple effect, opening doors for more women of color and Black Americans to ascend to the highest ranks of American politics.
 "Anti-Black racism continues to shape law, culture, politics and more in this country and impact brutally on the lives of Black Americans," said Jones, author of "Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All." "And at the same time, I think Senator Harris' ascent to the vice presidency tells us that Black Americans, including Black women, are nonetheless arriving in a new place in the story of American politics."
 Michigan resident Nia Crutcher, who just turned 18 and voted for the first time, represents the next generation of Americans. Crutcher, a Black woman and first-year college student, cast her ballot for Biden.
 "I don't think racism will be solved because Biden is elected because it's an issue we need to work on over the years. But I feel that with Biden being elected, there will definitely be more progress," Crutcher said. "I'm hopeful."

The coronavirus pandemic has taken a huge toll on the country, killing some 236,250 people so far, while social unrest over the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, has only hardened divisions that already existed.
 Many voters were hoping for a decisive election that would offer some calm, whichever candidate they cast ballots for.
 Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz Group’s chief economic adviser, said he hoped a Biden administration could work with Congress to get a handle on the pandemic and pass an economic stimulus package for struggling Americans.

A tropical storm warning was issued for South Florida and the Florida Keys as Eta regains tropical storm strength as the center reforms to the Northeast, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Saturday.
 An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter indicated that the maximum sustained winds in Eta have increased to 50 miles per hour, the NHC said.
 Eta was located about 30 miles north-north west of Cayman Island Saturday afternoon.
 Cuba’s meteorology office warned on Saturday of torrential rain and flooding as Tropical Depression Eta churned northwards towards the Caribbean island, and on track to Florida, after killing more than 70 people in Central America last week.
 Eta could strengthen back into a tropical storm over the warm Caribbean waters before making landfall on the southern coast of central Cuba overnight, the office said, warning of coastal flooding and winds of 80-100 km per hour.
 Flooding could be a problem more broadly, it said, given Cuba was already waterlogged in the wake of heavy rains of late and Eta was set to dump more water on central and mountainous regions.
 “As the ground is already saturated, any additional rain could provoke inundations especially in mountainous areas and along the rivers,” Cuba’s best known meteorologist Jose Rubiera said on the Friday evening news broadcast on state-run TV.
 The northwestern coast, including Havana’s seafront, will probably flood moderately from Sunday to Tuesday, he said.
 The government discussed measures on Friday to evacuate people, especially those living downstream from dams, and protect crops, homes and animals, according to state-run media.
 Given Eta’s stormfront was uneven, there was the risk of torrential rain occurring across the entire country and Prime Minister Manuel Marrero warned against complacency in eastern or western regions.
 The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned that flash and urban flooding would also be a possibility for the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, the Bahamas and southern Florida.
 Tropical storm conditions were possible in the Florida Keys and south and central Florida from late Sunday, it said.
 One of the fiercest storms to hit Central America in years, Eta struck Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on Tuesday with winds of 150 miles per hour before weakening to a tropical depression as it moved inland and into neighboring Honduras and Belize.
 Across swaths of the mostly poor countries wedged between Mexico and Colombia, high winds, torrential rains and catastrophic flooding caused deadly mudslides and damaged hundreds if not thousands of homes.

 The play served as the highlight of a dominant performance by the Rams. They jumped out to a two-touchdown lead in the opening 9 minutes and 3 seconds and never looked back.
 "I think this was a statement game for us," Andrew said. "We showed we're not going to back down from anyone."
 MICDS running backs Shawn Putman (11 caries 105 yards) and Steven Hall (12-90) chewed up yards on a regular basis allowing the hosts to control the time of possession. That kept the Titans' explosive offense off the field.

 It's that time of year again. Leaves are rapidly falling from deciduous trees so it's a good time to stop and think about options for handling the litter.
 Although a scattering of leaves won't harm the lawn, excessive cover prevents sunlight from reaching turfgrass plants.
 Turf left in this state for an extended period will be unable to make the carbohydrates needed to carry it through the winter.
 There are options for dealing with the fallen leaves other than bagging them up and putting them out for the trash collector. Composting is a great way to handle the refuse. Compost can then be used in the vegetable garden and flowerbeds.
 An even easier method of making good use of the leaves is direct incorporation in either vegetable gardens or annual flower beds.
 Use a lawn mower with a bagging attachment to chop and collect the leaves.
 Transport them to the garden or bed and apply a 2 to 3 inch layer of leaves on the surface of the soil and then till them in.
 Repeat the process every couple of weeks until you run out of leaves or the weather becomes too cold or the soil becomes too wet.
 With luck, you should be able to make 3 to 4 applications this fall.
 Another option is to mow the leaves with a mulching mower and let shredded leaves filter into the turf canopy. (A side-discharge mower also will work, but it won't shred the leaves as thoroughly.) This method will be most effective if you do it often enough that leaf litter doesn't become too thick. Mow while you can still see grass peeking through the leaves.
 You may wonder whether this practice will be detrimental to the lawn in the long run. Research at Michigan State University in which they used a mulching mower to shred up to about one pound of leaves per square yard of lawn (one pound is equal to approximately 6 inches of leaves piled on the grass) for five consecutive years, found no long-term effects of the shredded leaves on turf quality, thatch thickness, organic content of the thatch, or soil test results (pH, nutrients, etc.).
 If you mow leaves and have a cool-season lawn, it makes sense to be on a fall nitrogen fertilization program and core-aerate in the fall (things you should be doing anyway).
 If you have a warm-season lawn, you can still use this technique but wait to fertilize and core-aerate until next late May or early June.

Research at Michigan State University in which they used a mulching mower to shred up to about one pound of leaves per square yard of lawn (one pound is equal to approximately 6 inches of leaves piled on the grass) for five consecutive years, found no long-term effects of the shredded leaves on turf quality, thatch thickness, organic content of the thatch, or soil test results (pH, nutrients, etc.).
   
 If you mow leaves and have a cool-season lawn, it makes sense to be on a fall nitrogen fertilization program and core-aerate in the fall (things you should be doing anyway).
   
 If you have a warm-season lawn, you can still use this technique but wait to fertilize and core-aerate until next late May or early June.

BOISE — Though just two seats in the Idaho Legislature flipped from one party to the other in last week’s election, there will be lots more new faces than that when the Legislature convenes in January.
 Statewide, there will be 17 new faces in the Legislature, thanks to general election decisions, results of the May primary election, and/or retirements of incumbents. In addition, four former lawmakers are returning to the Statehouse after absences of at least two years; and three current House members are moving across the rotunda to the Senate.
 All told, that means 24 of the 105 seats in the Legislature — nearly a quarter — will have different occupants in January than they do now.
 House Speaker Scott Bedke commented, “Without term limits, we’ve turned the Legislature over deeply.”
 I looked back five years to 2016, and counted 56 lawmakers who were serving in 2016 but won’t occupy those seats in January, including 14 senators and 42 House members. Two of those 2016 House members will be in the Senate in January. But still, about half the Legislature is turning over in five years.
 This year, the three House members who are moving to the Senate are Reps. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise; Christy Zito, R-Hammett; and Doug Ricks, R-Rexburg.
 The four former lawmakers who are returning are newly reelected Reps. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello; Ron Nate, R-Rexburg; and Karey Hanks, R-St. Anthony, all three of whom retook the seats they lost two years ago; and James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, who served from 2006 to 2010 and was House assistant minority leader.
 Bedke said the 17 legislative newcomers will need to be “brought up to speed,” but he thought that would be an easy task. “These are quick studies,” he said. “They’ve been successful in the other areas of life they’ve entered.”
 The new faces include newly elected Sens. Peter Riggs, R-Coeur d’Alene; Ali Rabe, D-Boise; and Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls. The new House members are newly elected Reps. Doug Okuniewicz, R-Hayden; Brandon Mitchell, R-Moscow; Charlie Shepherd, R-Riggins; Julie Yamamoto, R-Caldwell; Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa; Ben Adams, R-Nampa; Codi Galloway, R-Boise; Colin Nash, D-Boise; Chris Mathias, D-Boise; Greg Ferch, R-Boise; Matthew Bundy, R-Mountain Home; David Cannon, R-Blackfoot; Marco Erickson, R-Idaho Falls; and Jon Weber, R-Rexburg.

Former Hayden High and Washburn University bass angler Thomas Heinen made Flint Hills Bass Association history this fall, becoming the first nonboater in recent memory to win Angler of the Year in the club.
   
 This also marks the fifth straight year Heinen has won Nonboater of the Year.
   
 "This year has had its ups and downs due to COVID-19," Heinen said. "It has set back a lot of dates on the 2020 fishing schedule, but things seemed to work out. My goal at the beginning of the year was to win Nonboater of the Year again. My first three tournaments went well for me, fortunately, and I had some good points starting out.
   
 "After I realized I was leading nonboater points, I set another goal, which was to win Angler of the Year of the club. I knew it was a long shot of a goal being a nonboater, but it was definitely achievable. I'm very thankful for the support of mentors and friends I have had along the way."
   
 Heinen finished first in the standings, which were finalized Friday morning, despite a good effort from runner-up Tate Herrman to make up the difference in the Sept. 27 regular-season finale on La Cygne Reservoir in Linn County. Herrman and teammate Matt Brown finished first at that event with a bag weight of 18.34 pounds.
   
 Herrman (296) came up two points shy of the AOY award in the final standings, followed by fellow Topekans Richard Heflin (284), Rue Armstrong (282) and Larry Brumley (275).
   
 This year's awards ceremony has been canceled because of COVID-19, and the Classic was postponed until a time to be determined.
   
 "I am very fortunate to have won the 2020 Angler of the Year title, along with the Nonboater of the Year title," Heinen said. "This wouldn't have been possible without great sponsors who helped me along the way: Falcon Rods, Z-Man Fishing Products, Yakima Bait Company, K-Guard Leaf Free Gutter Systems, Pro-Cure Bait Scents, Davin Electric, BJ McGivern, C&C; Body Shop, Trophy Bass Company, Bob Brown's Auto Services and Carhartt. This year's fishing season is winding down with only a few events left in my other tournament trails I fish. I just hope I can keep the momentum going into next fishing season."

Biden, 77, staked his candidacy less on any distinctive political ideology than on galvanizing a broad coalition of voters around the notion that Trump posed an existential threat to American democracy. The strategy proved effective, resulting in pivotal victories in Michigan and Wisconsin as well as Pennsylvania, onetime Democratic bastions that had flipped to Trump in 2016.
 Biden was on track to win the national popular vote by more than 4 million, a margin that could grow as ballots continue to be counted.
 Trump seized on delays in processing the vote in some states to falsely allege voter fraud and argue that his rival was trying to seize power — an extraordinary charge by a sitting president trying to sow doubt about a bedrock democratic process.
 As the vote count played out, Biden tried to ease tensions and project an image of presidential leadership, hitting notes of unity that were seemingly aimed at cooling the temperature of a heated, divided nation.
 “We have to remember the purpose of our politics isn’t total unrelenting, unending warfare,” Biden said Friday night in Delaware. “No, the purpose of our politics, the work of our nation, isn’t to fan the flames of conflict, but to solve problems, to guarantee justice, to give everybody a fair shot.”
 Kamala Harris also made history as the first Black woman to become vice president, an achievement that comes as the U.S. faces a reckoning on racial justice. The California senator, who is also the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency, will become the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in government, four years after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.
 Trump is the first incumbent president to lose reelection since Republican George H.W. Bush in 1992. It was unclear whether Trump would publicly concede.
 Earlier Saturday Trump left the White House for his Virginia golf club dressed in golf shoes, a windbreaker and a white hat as the results gradually expanded Biden’s lead in Pennsylvania. Trump repeated his unsupported allegations of election fraud and illegal voting on Twitter, but they were quickly flagged as potentially misleading by the social media platform.
 One of his erroneous tweets: "I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!"
 The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Biden was spending Saturday morning with family and advisers at home in Wilmington, Delaware, his campaign said.

The utter rejection of Biden as the legitimate president by Trump and his supporters appears to represent something new in American political history, said Barbara Perry, presidential studies director at the University of Virginia's Miller Center.


  "We typically haven't had a leader who loses the presidency who then tells his followers, `This is false. This has been stolen from us,'" Perry said. "Incumbent presidents have been mad, so mad they didn't go to the inauguration, but not like this, where they are leading those people to say this is fraudulent."


  A couple of thousand Trump supporters gathered at the Pennsylvania Capitol in Harrisburg. Pennsylvania played a crucial role in Biden's victory.


  "If we don't stop this today, it'll all be over," Bruce Fields, 66, said of news organizations declaring Biden the winner. "Otherwise we can kiss freedom goodbye."


  About two dozen heavily armed men, some wearing camouflage, joined the rally.


  At the Arizona Capitol in Phoenix, a crowd swelled to more than 1,000 within hours. Biden won Arizona on his way to victory in the Electoral College.


  "It's very suspicious that President Trump, with the red wave we've been seeing in Arizona, is struggling," Kelli Ward, former state senator and chairwoman of the Arizona Republican Party, told boisterous pro-Trump demonstrators. "I want to know if there is any discrepancy with the numbers coming out of the machines."


  More than 1,000 people gathered at the Texas Capitol in Austin, with police keeping Trump and Biden supporters on opposite sides of the street. Several hundred demonstrators turned out in Salem, Oregon, for a "Stop the Steal" rally.


  Even in a place that wasn't close, Trump supporters gathered in droves to express support for him and vent frustration over the outcome of the election. Outside North Dakota's Capitol in Bismarck, the state's all-Republican congressional delegation joined chanting, sign-carrying protesters.


  A few skirmishes broke out between Trump backers and pro-Biden and Black Lives Matters demonstrators, with one BLM supporter attempting to handcuff himself to a Trump supporter. The two men began wrestling on the ground.


  An officer escorted the Black Lives Matter supporter to a squad car. It was unclear if he had been arrested.


  In Lansing, Michigan, about 50 Trump supporters and a smaller group of marchers carrying Black Lives Matter flags converged on the state Capitol, where they pushed, shoved and shouted at one another in a tense standoff. But within moments of the race being called, a few from both sides broke into prayer, and at least one pair hugged.


  Frank Dobbs, 40, of Henderson, Nevada, brought a bullhorn and a Trump 2020 flag that he wrestled with in a stiff wind during a rally outside the Clark County registrar of voters office in North Las Vegas.


  "It's not over until it's over. There's still the courts. If ever there's ever a time to expose widespread fraud, this is the president to do it," Dobbs said. "The media doesn't decide who wins the presidency. The legal voters of this country decide."

 So the this case is not comparable to Bush v. Gore. So in 2000, you basically, the election came down to one state and we're talking about a very small margin. And really there's a significant question as to how the ballots were being counted and were they being counted in a way that was uniform. Moreover, as the process went along and the secretary of state certified a winner, then the question was, can you, what is that you're going to do to overcome that presumption? And will continuing the process undermine the legitimacy of the election, especially in light of the fact that there didn't seem to be significant evidence or any evidence of wrongdoing?
 And so, you had a winner who was trying to preserve, this was Bush, trying to preserve his margins. And this case, you have the president who is behind, significantly behind and in a number of different states. And we don't have the same, anywhere near the same, set of questions with respect to the counting of the ballots.
 As far as we know, all of the evidence that we have and all of these various states is that the ballots were accurately counted. And so there's really nothing for him to point to.
 So it doesn't come down to one state is behind, it doesn't have the evidence and it just is not a comparable situation, as much as one would like for it to be. The facts just are not there.

WELLINGTON -- Usually kids start playing youth football in first or second grade. Colton Elmore got to play in kindergarten because his older brother, Trenton, was playing, and he wanted to play too.
   
 Colton made his first touchdown that season.
   
 "It was 46 yards," said his coach, Lonnie Vargas. "He ran a sweep. I knew right then, for his being that young, he was a special kid. He's going to go far."
   
 When Colton was in second grade, coaches started keeping track of his stats. Colton, now 11 and in fifth grade, knew he had to be approaching his 100th touchdown. About five seconds before kickoff at a youth football game in Worden Park last weekend, he asked his coach, Brandon Lambert how many touchdowns he made. Coach Lambert told him, "Don't worry about it."
   
 Two and a half minutes into the game, Colton, a quarterback, made his first touchdown of three in the game. It was his 100th touchdown. Lambert took the ball Colton had brought to the end zone and had all the other players secretly sign it when Colton wasn't looking.
   
 After the game, in which the Dukes beat the Wichita West Side Eagles 25-0, Colton, team quarterback, was presented with the game ball, signed by all his teammates. Neither Colton nor his family had known what was coming.
   
 "He got choked up," said Colton's mother, Jaime Elmore. "He got emotional. It was the first time I've ever seen him cry tears of joy."
   
 Colton shook hands with everyone on his team and thanked them for helping him achieve this milestone.
   
 "He has some very talented boys who block for him and allow him to go into the end zone," Elmore said. "They're a very good team."
   
 Vargas said he was sure Colton would make that 100th touchdown.
   
 "He has a knack for getting the ball in the end zone whether it's a run or making a pass," Vargas said. "All ways and shapes you can score, he's done it."
   
 Colton said he wants to play college and NFL football, with the OU Sooners in college for sure. He loves the game, and his signed football that now sits on a shelf in his room.

 LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Centenares de partidarios se trasladaban a La Paz para participar el domingo en el juramento de Luis Arce como nuevo presidente de Bolivia, mientras grupos opositores que impugnan la victoria del líder izquierdista mantenían protestas que el sábado parecían disminuir tras una noche de enfrentamientos callejeros entre bandos contrarios.
 En tanto, el rey Felipe VI fue la primera alta autoridad en arribar a la ciudad de La Paz, donde fue declarado huésped ilustre de la urbe. En su delegación también se encontraba Pablo Iglesias, vicepresidente segundo del gobierno español.
 Por la noche, arribó el presidente argentino Alberto Fernández. Ambas delegaciones fueron recibidas con honores militares.
 Poco antes, llegaron el canciller de Irán, Mohammad Yavad Zarif, y su homólogo venezolano Jorge Arreaza.
 Todos fueron recibidos por los presidentes del Senado, Andrónico Rodríguez, y de la Cámara de Diputados, Freddy Mamani —ambos del partido de Arce y del expresidente Evo Morales.
 En La Paz, la sede de gobierno, los obreros terminaban de armar tarimas frente al balcón del palacio presidencial desde donde Arce se dirigirá a sus partidarios tras jurar al cargo. Grupos de indígenas han preparado bailes folclóricos para celebrar a su líder.
 “Estamos dando los últimos toques”, dijo Freddy Bobaryn, miembro de la Comisión de Transición.
 En las ciudades de Santa Cruz y Cochabamba, al oriente y centro del país que son bastiones de la oposición, la situación parecía en calma tras dos días de protestas con esporádicos choques callejeros.
 “La mayoría de las calles están transitables”, dijo por teléfono Rafael Reyes, vecino de Santa Cruz. Esa ciudad, motor económico del país, quedó paralizada el viernes por barricadas callejeras de grupos opositores al Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS), el partido de Arce y del expresidente Evo Morales.
 La polarización política se profundizó desde el estallido social que dejó 36 muertos hace un año tras unas elecciones denunciadas como fraudulentas y que obligó a Morales a renunciar tras 14 años en el poder. En esos comicios, Morales buscaba un cuarto mandato consecutivo. El exmandatario prepara su regreso el martes desde su exilio en Argentina.
 La contundente victoria de Arce, heredero político y ex ministro de Economía de Morales, envalentonó a los opositores que han salido a las calles en cinco ciudades para denunciar un supuesto fraude que ha sido desmentido por el Tribunal Supremo Electoral, los observadores internacionales e incluso por políticos rivales.
 “Arce tiene múltiples desafíos, pero el primero es reconciliar a los bolivianos y reconstruir una democracia plural y respetuosa con la oposición y no una democracia autoritaria como tuvimos con Morales”, dijo a The Associated Press Carlos Cordero, profesor de Ciencia Política de la Universidad Mayor de San Andrés en La Paz, pública.
 El nuevo presidente “enfrentará un panorama económico complicado. Tendrá que abordar los desequilibrios macroeconómicos y reactivar la economía después de una fuerte recesión”, opinó Rodrigo Riaza, de la Unidad de Inteligencia del diario británico The Economist.
 Economista pragmático y antineoliberal de 57 años y considerado el cerebro del éxito económico de Morales de quien fue ministro por 12 años, Arce anticipó que creará un gobierno “abierto a todos” los países, incluso Estados Unidos, del que se distanció Morales.
 La primera delegación en llegar fue la comitiva estadounidense encabezada por Brent Mcintosh, subsecretario del Tesoro para Asuntos Internacionales. Para la noche se tiene previsto la llegada de los presidentes Iván Duque, de Colombia, y Mario Abdo Benítez, de Paraguay.
 La presidente interina Jeanine Áñez no participará de la ceremonia y se ha replegado a su ciudad Trinidad en el oriente, informó el viceministro de Coordinación Gubernamental, Israel Alanoca.

MIDDLEBORO -- As the Fireside Grille approaches its one-year anniversary under the ownership of Michael and Erin Dearing, the couple is looking forward to celebrating with the community where they grew up.


  "My wife and I actually met in the fourth grade at the Burkland School in Middleboro in 1980 and we were like the best of friends all through school. We really had a lifetime together here in Middleboro, so when we had the chance to come back home, it was really great," Michael said.


  Growing up in the restaurant industry, Michael knew it was a career he could see himself pursuing and sought for the right opportunity to return to his hometown.


  "I've had the good fortune of trying a lot of other things, but the restaurant business is like no other business. When you think about the influence that restaurants have on people's lives and special occasions, there's no substitute for that," Michael said.


  After high school, Michael continued his formal education at Johnson & Wales University.


  "Right out of college I went to work for, what was then called, ITT Sheraton," he explained, which was an international hotel chain. "Within a year, I became a food and beverage director for Sheraton, which was really a neat thing. That was my first stop right out of college."


  After spending some time developing his professional knowledge in the hotel industry, Michael spent the next decade working multiple different positions at a variety of different restaurants, a list that includes the position of general manager at the Chart House Restaurant Company in Boston, being one of the founding partners of Fleming's Steakhouse & Wine Bar, as well as the restaurant executive with both Border Cafe and Darden Restaurants, Inc.


  "I was on the road all the time," he said. "And we kind of just continued to say, 'Boy, if we're ever going to make a lifestyle change, could we come full circle and find an opportunity where we can not be on the road and be immersed in our community.' So the fact that we found an opportunity in Middleboro, it couldn't have been better."


  Michael and Erin bought Fireside Grille from the Barrett family on December of 2019. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved a few months later, they were forced to adapt and navigate through new regulations, including takeout, and eventually outdoor seating.


  "We've really had to reinvent ourselves for COVID. This property is a wonderful place, but it's never really been set up for outdoor dining or takeout," Michael said. "And we really had to learn on the fly how to adapt and put those things in place."


  The outdoor seating was a hit with the community, and looks to be a permanent addition to the Fireside Grille.


  "My wife, Erin, does a lot of the day to day operations and then our three kids work here too," Michael explains.


  Mikayla, though currently away at school, was often found hostessing or managing the takeout orders, while Derek and Dylan could be found working at the buffet and busing tables.


  "Something my dad taught me as a youngster is the culinary side of the business and how important it was to source local ingredients," Michael said. "So something that we've done is sort of revamped both the food menu and the drink menu to reflect locally sourced ingredients. We make 99 percent of what we serve."


  For their one-year anniversary on Dec. 7, the Dearings hope to partner with the community to raise donations for a charitable cause. Whoever brings in a donation will be able to pick from a unique menu that they have created just their anniversary. Though Michael and Erin haven't determined the charity they wish to donate to yet, they are excited to be giving back to the community.


  Michael says, "Something I've always believed in is take care of our customers, take care of each other, and take care of the community -- and those are the three pillars that we have built this restaurant on."

While many small dairies across the country are failing, a small Kansas dairy with slightly more than 130 cows is thriving.
   
 Although it is still hard work, and the margins remain small, the dairy has remained in the black throughout the pandemic.
   
 For Hildebrand Farms, a family-owned business in Junction City, cows make up their livelihood. That's why they treat the little ladies to home-produced grains and fields where they can romp around all day.
   
 "They're going to do better if we take care of them," said Melissa Hildebrand- Reed, the farm's operations manager. "The cows' ideal temperature is about 40 degrees."
   
 During the 1920s, Arnold and Rose Hildebrand came over from Switzerland, eventually moving to Junction City, where they bought a few cows. Their children and grandchildren expanded the farm and decided to create Hildebrand Farms. The family began bottling milk offsite, and in 2008 they brought the bottling plant to their farm and started selling their milk bottles statewide. Currently, the Hildebrands sell to more than 120 stores throughout the state.
   
 "One cow will support a grocery store," Hildebrand-Reed said. "They produce eight gallons a day."
   
 In addition to the Holsteins, the farm has quite a few calves and a pasture full of steers. Along with their milk, the dairy processes beef and harvests grains.
   
 Milk facts
   
 Hildebrand is one of 300 dairies in Kansas and one of approximately 30,000 small dairy farms nationwide. According to the Kansas Department of Agriculture, approximately 80% to 85% of the milk produced in the state is produced in western Kansas on 29 large farms.
   
 Milk production in Kansas during September 2020 totaled 332 million pounds: this was up 7% from September 2019, according to the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service. The average number of milk cows was 171,000 head, 8,000 head more than September 2019.
   
 Glass bottles
   
 Hildebrand wants to be as ecologically friendly as possible. By growing their own grains to feed their animals and using glass bottles, which they recycle, they are trying to lessen their footprint.
   
 "Using glass is more expensive, but it tastes better," said David Hildebrand, who along with his brother, Alan Hildebrand - Melissa's father - owns and helps run the dairy. Other family members are also instrumental in the farm's operation.
   
 During the beginning months of COVID-19, Hildebrand had a shortage of people and businesses returning bottles. Because of this, they had to order more. Normally, they replace about 20% of their bottles, but during the spring of 2020, they had to replace half of them.
   
 "It hurts," Hildebrand-Reed said. "We worked out systems, and it got straightened out."
   
 Flavors
   
 Along with the usual whole, 2% and skim, Hildebrand produces a cream line variety, which is pasteurized but not homogenized, forming the cream at the top. Pasteurization is a heating method to kill pathogenic microorganisms, while homogenization breaks down the milk into smaller units so it mixes more easily.
   
 Along with cream, the company sells chocolate, root beer and strawberry milk. And for the holidays, they bring out the eggnog. This year, they have a holiday bottle design.
   
 "My favorite is root beer," said Cinder Varelman, a customer from Junction City. "It's unique."
   
 Ice cream
   
 At their retail store in Junction City, they serve homemade ice cream. Currently, the flavor is pumpkin spice.
   
 "It's delicious," Varelman said. "Their ice cream has the perfect consistency. It's beautiful ice cream."
   
 U.S. Army Sgt. Peter Tibbetts, of Augusta, Maine, agreed.
   
 "It reminds me of the pumpkin festival back home," he said. "It's always good."
   
 The future
   
 At 93, Margaret Hildebrand, the family matriarch, is still looking out for the calves, making sure they are healthy and safe. The family hopes to pass the farm on to generations to come. Each generation continues to grow and modernize the business.
   
 "Our next large investment is robotic milkers," Hildebrand-Reed said.
   
 Labor of love
   
 "It's been tough because we have a lot of labor," David said. "We have a lot of costs."
   
 Usually, the farm is open to tours, but because of COVID-19, they have stopped them for now. But the store remains open, and the cows remain visible from the storefront.
   
 "We have a history of bridging the gap between the farm and the public," Hildebrand-Reed said. "We want to be a mom and pop Kansas dairy. We don't want to be national. We want to be a Kansas brand."

Rather, we live simple lives and those observations related to how a fish lives, swims and eats seem to be more important than just about anything else.
 One such observation circulated last week with the enthusiastic momentum often displayed by grown men who employ child-like wonder. The first text simply shared the word “frozen” with our group. I am sure that the sender forgot to attach a picture as his one-word proclamation left readers with mild confusion.
 Quickly, my phone chirped again and a picture came through. The image explained with great clarity what the single word could not and was, well, … worth a thousand words. In vivid detail, our group saw one of our favorite ice fishing ponds in its initial change from open water to ice.
 The air temperature that morning was 12 and any one of us could have predicted the exciting transformation of this waterbody. There was no wind, and overnight a thin sheet of ice covered the water like a gift wrapping for those in wait.
 An advantage to living in northern New Hampshire is that the winter climate allows for expanded outdoor activities as they relate to snow and ice. I have skied in June, ice fished in May, and I keep a snow shovel in the back of my truck year-round.
 The location and its transformation that inspired us on that cold morning is one that we have historically ice fished on Thanksgiving weekend. While some eat and watch football games, my small group of friends can usually be found outside perforating small, shallow waterbodies with six-inch holes.
 The advantages of fresh ice are many. In February, it may take a few minutes to drill through three feet of ice; chipping away now is much easier.
 Within minutes of stepping on the ice, baits and lines are dropped through, marking the official start of a favorite season.
 It would seem that those fish approaching our bait are anything but weary. They are trying to find food in a cold and somewhat barren environment. A fresh minnow, juicy worm, or small jig is usually eaten quickly and decisively. The catch rates for early-season ice fishing are some of the highest we will see all winter.
 It would seem that a cautionary statement would be appropriate here as early- season ice can be unpredictable and create an unreliable barrier between man and water. Hazardous conditions exist throughout an entire year and the adventure that I am currently describing is no exception. It becomes important for early-season ice anglers to test the ice thickness with every step.
 Moving slowly with the rhythmic pounding of a heavy chisel (also colorfully referred to as a spud) usually does the trick.
 It can be hard to look forward to winter and I do not know of many people who do. Among my small group of fishing buddies, it is a seasonal transformation that brings excitement and anticipation.
 There is nothing we can do to slow it down anyway, and embracing it seems logical and therapeutic.

 # Fight for Senate control awaits in Georgia after Biden’s win
 Lisa Mascaro
 AP Congressional Correspondent
 View Comments
 _Washington_ – Control of the Senate likely won’t be decided until a January runoff in Georgia, even after Democrat Joe Biden won the White House on Saturday.
 That post-election cliff-hanger will determine the balance of power in Washington, as neither party appears to have a lock on a Senate majority right now.
 So far, the tally for the next Senate is 48 Republicans and 48 Democrats after Tuesday’s election. Two seats in Georgia are headed to runoffs on Jan. 5. And seats in North Carolina and Alaska are still to early to call.
 The stakes are high for for a momentous political struggle in Georgia during President Donald Trump’s final lame-duck days in office. The state is closely divided, with Democrats making gains on Republicans, fueled by a surge of new voters. But no Democrat has been elected senator in some 20 years. As much as $500 million could be spent on the two races, one strategist said.
 “Now we take Georgia, and then we change America,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told a crowd celebrating Biden’s victory Saturday on the streets of Brooklyn.
 With a Democratic majority in the Senate, the party that also controls the House would have a firm grasp on power in Washington. Biden would have latitude over nominees, including for his Cabinet, and a chance to push major portions of his legislative agenda through Congress. If Democrats fall short, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, could wield the power to check Biden’s ambitions.
 “The Senate is the last line of defense,” tweeted the National Republican Senatorial Committee as soon as the presidential race was called for Biden. It was a fundraising appeal.
 Republicans have been working to retain their majority, but even if they secure the final two races where ballots are still being counted in North Carolina and Alaska, they would still fall short of the 51 seats needed.
 In North Carolina, Sen. Thom Tillis is trying to fend off Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham in a tight race that is too early to call. Alaska GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan is favored for another term against Al Gross, an independent running as a Democrat.
 The political math problem for Republicans is that the vice president of the party holding the White House casts the tie-breaking vote in the Senate. Next year that would be Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. That means 50 seats for Democrats would result in control over the chamber. But Republicans would need 51 seats to cement their hold on power.
 That would put Georgia center stage, as many expect is about to happen.
 Both Senate seats in the state are now held by Republican incumbents. They were forced into the January runoff contests after no candidate reached the 50% threshold needed to win outright in multi-candidate races.
 GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler will face Rafael Warnock, a Black pastor from the church where Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. And Republican Sen. David Perdue, a top Trump ally, will face Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff.
 “Now more than ever, we NEED to keep the Senate in Republican hands,” tweeted Loeffler. She said Saturday that she and Perdue are “the last line of defense against the radical left.”
 Ossoff’s campaign aired a new ad, detailing a “path to recovery” from the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. He calls for following the advice of medical experts to deal with the virus and a massive infrastructure plan to create jobs.
 “We need leaders who bring us together to get this done,” Ossoff says in the ad.
 Biden had been mum on the Senate balance as he awaited the results in his own election, but he offered a preview before Tuesday’s election.
 “I can’t tell you how important it is that we flip the United States Senate. There’s no state more consequential than Georgia in that fight,” Biden declared at an Atlanta rally on Oct. 27, when he campaigned alongside Ossoff and Warnock.
 Republicans agree. “It’s all on the line in Georgia,” said Steven Law, the president of Senate Leadership Fund, the outside group aligned with McConnell that spent big trying keep Senate control.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reminded her colleagues of the stakes for the entire party during the lame-duck sprint ahead.
 “How we conduct it in the next two months will affect how we do in Georgia,” Pelosi told House Democrats, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the private caucus call. She reminded colleagues to be “respectful.”

As the road to state gets narrower, Century High School hosted Bishop Kelly High School Friday night in the quarterfinals.
 The Century Diamondbacks coming off a close 17-14 win against Lakeland last week. It was a different story for the Bishop Kelly Knights who dominated a competitive Pocatello Indians teams 35-0.
 BK hadn't lost since the first game of the season.
 A lot on the line, as the winner moves on to the semifinals.
 It's a scoreless first, which gives the impression that this game is going to be one tough matchup.
 In the top of the second, the Diamondbacks first offensive series, quarterback McKean Romreill hands it off to Jovan Sowell who finds room down the sideline for a 40-yard run.
 This sets up Century for their first touchdown of the night as Emmett Holt fights his way into the end zone, as the crowd sings him happy birthday.
 Century is up 7-0, which will remain through the half.
 The Diamondbacks come out ready to dominate in the second half as Easton Millward makes it 14-0 as he runs his way right through the middle of Bishop Kelly's defense.
 On the Diamondbacks next offensive series, came one of the most exciting plays of the night, as Bruin Fleishchmann takes it all the way down the field for a 95-yard touchdown run.
 It was 20-0 going into the fourth, where Bishop Kelly finally gets into the end zone to make it 20-7 with 10 minutes left on the clock.
 Century wins 33-14 against one of the toughest competitors in the state.
 They will play away at Emmett High School next Friday.
 "It feels pretty good," said Century Head Coach Travis Hobson after the big win. "It's hard to lie about that. That's a good football team. They're a good ball club, and we knew our work was cut out for us. I kind of like the underdog role. We're not mad about being the underdog. We'll be the underdog again next week too, and that's okay with me."

When it comes to energy sources, Kansas isn't the luckiest of states. But it's pretty lucky.
   
 The state has oil, natural gas and wind. It also has crops, such as corn and milo, that can be used to produce such fuels as ethanol.
   
 When it comes to fossil fuels, such as oil and natural gas, Kansas is an also- ran. Its production is tiny compared to Texas and several other states.
   
 Texas also produces a lot more wind energy than any other state, but Kansas does rank in the top five when it comes to wind power.
   
 Its mix of old and renewable sources means Kansas is well situated as the world's energy markets continue to evolve.
   
 But whether the state actually prospers in the years ahead by optimizing its energy resources will depend on its ability to keep pace with the forces of change.
   
 Like so much else, energy has become another topic used to politically divide people. And as the effects of climate change have grown more apparent, those political divisions have grown wider and deeper.
   
 The guardians of fossil fuels are on one side. Many of them insist climate change is a hoax -- or if it is real, well, it doesn't have anything to do with anything humans are doing on the planet.
   
 On the other side are environmentalists. The more extreme of that crowd demand that we make major sacrifices. They want us to change what we eat, how many kids we have, what we drive and virtually every other aspect of how we live.
   
 Rather than pick either side, most Americans would prefer to find ways to move forward without major disruptions.
   
 For example, it's doubtful that Americans in any significant numbers would voluntarily give up their cars. But they would be willing to drive vehicles powered by hydrogen, electricity or other energy sources if they are affordable and the infrastructure exists to keep them up and running.
   
 Similarly, many of us will not agree to give up meat because environmentalists claim that cows require too much grain and produce too much methane gas. But we are interested in research that provides farmers and ranchers with the means of reducing the carbon footprint of beef and dairy operations.
   
 Science has tremendous potential to help us solve or at least mitigate our environmental issues. We just need to stop treating every disagreement and problem as a political or ideological battle.
   
 That's not to say that there won't be disruption. Change often comes with a downside for some, even as it provides opportunities to others.
   
 When gas-powered vehicles replaced horses, one industry declined as another grew.
   
 When homes started using electricity and natural gas to power furnaces, ovens and lighting systems, coal and kerosene businesses slowly but surely lost customers.
   
 These were, for the most part, economic transitions, not abrupt changes. And that likely will be how the energy changes we need to take place will occur.
   
 There will be winners and losers. There will be states, industries and businesses better prepared than others to transition to the next chapter of American energy.
   
 Kansans should not get bogged down in political combat or ideological warfare. Let's support research and investments that position us to benefit from the technologies being developed and the practices and policies that are being formed.

He got his start in bowling at Shoaf where his father managed three alleys in the basement of a church. Nagy began bowling seriously at age 26 starting in 1939 on a Booster division team in a league reserved for lower-level players. He quickly dominated his competition, however, and by 1941 he was bowling on the American Bowling Congress (ABC) professional circuit. He was competitive throughout the 1940s but stardom eluded him, and he never placed higher than third in the annual ABC All-Star competition.
 Thirteen years after his first appearance in 1939, Nagy set an Open Championships doubles record (1,453) with fellow Hall of Famer Johnny Klares that stood until 1989.
 Nagy was twice voted the Bowler of the Year and four times an All-American, he was ranked No. 23 among 20th Century bowlers in the Bowlers Journal poll. His tournament resume includes five ABC championships and the 1954-55 All-Star.
 Big and gregarious, Nagy was a showman. Sam Levine, a great friend of Nagy's, captured some of Nagy's lighter moments in an article in The Cleveland Kegler.
 Levine wrote:
 “Who will ever forget Nagy, when on a television show, after leaving a pin standing on what looked like a good hit, he pulled the belt from his trousers and gave his bowling ball a good beating.
 “There was another during a head-to-head clash with George Young of Detroit. Young, also a member of the ABC Hall of Fame, was a “pumper.” He would stand at the foul line and pump the ball up and down and up and down numerous times. After Young had completed one of his deliveries, Nagy quipped, with tongue in cheek -- 'You know George, I notice that every time you pump the ball 12 times, you get a strike.' After his next trip to the foul line, Young returned and shouted at Nagy, 'Darn you Steve, now you've got me counting.'"

Issa ran this year in the neighboring and more conservative 50th District anchored in eastern San Diego County. That seat became vacant when GOP Congressman Duncan Hunter resigned after pleading guilty to a corruption charge.


  "Whether you supported me in this election or not, I will work tirelessly in Congress for all who call the 50th District their home, for The State of California which I love so much, and for our great country," Issa wrote.


  Issa was among a group of Republican congressional candidates who fared well even though President Donald Trump was trounced in California by Democrat Joe Biden. GOP candidates had leads of varying sizes in four California districts won by Democrats in 2018. Republicans currently hold just seven of California's 53 House seats.


  Issa was a strong supporter of Trump and on Friday he reiterated his support for the president's unsubstantiated claims against the electoral process, posting on his Facebook page a photo of himself with Trump, each giving a thumbs up.


  "President Trump -- I stand with you, just as you have stood with me from 2016 until today," Issa wrote. "The fact that poll watchers are not being allowed to adequately supervise certain recounts is completely unacceptable. This is America. Election integrity comes first."


  When Issa was last in Congress the GOP had a majority in the House. He was chairman of the oversight committee from 2011 to 2015 and oversaw high-profile investigations into the Obama administration, including its handling of affairs leading up to the attacks on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.


  Issa said he also pushed through 40 pieces of legislation under the Obama administration, showing his ability to get bipartisan support on issues. He said he backs a middle-ground approach on immigration that includes offering law-abiding immigrants the chance to fill jobs Americans do not want.


  Issa said he also will push for a common-sense approach to the coronavirus pandemic that brings in the voices of business to find a way to operate safely without having to shut down.


  His top priority, he said, will be to support the armed forces and veterans.


  "I want to take care of the troops," he told The Associated Press in an interview in October, acknowledging the military's presence in the 50th District and the Hunter family's enduring popularity there.


  Hunter, a combat Marine veteran, served 11 years in the seat before resigning and being sentenced to prison for misusing campaign funds. Hunter's father, who held the seat for decades, is still widely respected. He endorsed Issa.


  Issa, a car alarm magnate, spent heavily on the race to beat Campa-Najjar, who nearly ousted Hunter in 2018 as a political newcomer while the congressman was under indictment.


  Campa-Najjar built a strong grassroots campaign but he also angered Democrats by tacking too far to the right, touting his gun ownership and meeting with the founder of a right-wing group and saying he wasn't sure whether he would vote for Biden. He later apologized and showed a photo of his ballot to prove he voted for Biden.

Hart also connected Randell with former NZR board member Kevin Roberts, who was the global head of Saatchi & Saatchi.

My favourite in terms of hardware has to be the Switch. It seems wrong because it’s the youngest contender and it still has a way to go. But before it came out, I could count on one hand the number of games developed specifically for portable/handheld machines that really grabbed me and, after the Wii U, I felt that aside from a couple of exceptions, the long-accepted Nintendo hardware/software synergy was no longer that beneficial to gamers and little would be truly lost if they went third party.
