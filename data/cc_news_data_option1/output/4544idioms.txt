In this election, five states with a combined total of 68 electoral votes were too close to call, meaning they were running neck and neck with too little separating them. This was mainly due to the shifting fortunes of both candidates, especially when mail-in ballots were being counted. With more than 100 million votes cast early in the form of mail-in ballots or early votes, counting these votes added to the delay in declaring the results.

"Visitors talk to us as we screen them, and we’re always there to listen. There’s been a young man staying at the hospice recently and his wife and young children often visit. I heard one of the young children ask their Mum, ‘Will Daddy wake up?’ It’s so difficult, but I do whatever I can to make things easier. I drew a happy, little face on one of the masks for the child.
 "My friends often ask me if it’s upsetting, and it can be. People do share their emotions and that can stay with me. I always listen, try to distract them for a few moments, and say something comforting. Every Wednesday, without fail, I’m galvanised by the families and visitors I’ve met that day.
 "I make a lot of decisions on a Wednesday evening now. I think of all the things I’ve put off; I stop grumbling or coming up with distractions and make plans.
 "Volunteering at the hospice reminds me not to put anything off in my own life. I’m ticking off my bucket list. None of us know how we’d react with life changing news. And now, I don’t ever put off the words I should say more often – Thank you and I love you.”

They have emphasised the brewing part of their business model throughout 2020 over drink-in customers in their tap room. Instead of buying a pint or two, people were coming in and buying five litres to take away.
 They were initially hesitant to reopen the tap room when pubs were given the green light in July – as it is so small, if it is spread out too much, they couldn’t cover the costs. This meant they only opened for drinking in at the end of September.
 "I’ve been going as a commercial brewer five years, but we only moved to these new premises just over a year ago, at the end of last summer. We’re on a riverside, next to Staines Bridge. We were looking forward to a nice summer, with walkers coming by, and summer got cancelled. I can’t compare it with any other year, because we haven’t had any other year [here]."
 Knowing local friends who have gone out of business, they are keen not to be complacent in the current market. They currently have eight different beers to take away, including limited deliveries for those who are self-isolating.

The decisive call came in Pennsylvania, which gave Biden the necessary electoral votes to clinch the presidency. Biden could further pad his Electoral College victory in Arizona and Nevada, where he leads, and Georgia, which is neck and neck. (Trump has a more comfortable lead in North Carolina.) Biden already flipped two other states that Trump won in 2016: Michigan and Wisconsin, reclaiming Democrats' Rust Belt "blue wall." The former vice president also decisively won the most total votes, besting Trump by about 4 million.
 "One of the things I'm especially proud of is how well we've done all across America," Biden said in a speech Friday night as his vote total continued to climb over Trump's. "We are going to be the first Democrat to win Arizona in 24 years. We are going to be the first Democrat to win Georgia in 28 years. And we re-built the Blue Wall in the middle of the country that crumbled just four years ago. Pennsylvania. Michigan. Wisconsin. The heartland of this nation."
 For months, Trump had been laying the groundwork to reject the election results if they didn't go his way. He not only tried to undermine mail-in voting but claimed that if the winner wasn't declared on election night, the results would be suspect ― even though some state rules allow mail-in ballots to be received after Election Day.
 And sure enough, Trump did exactly as he said he would.
 "Frankly, we did win this election," Trump said Wednesday shortly after 2 a.m. Eastern, while millions of ballots had yet to be counted, a number of key swing states were still in limbo and no news organization had yet to project a winner.
 He also tweeted that Democrats were trying to "STEAL the Election" and wrote, "Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!" (No votes were cast after the polls closed.)
 On Thursday, he held a lie-filled news conference in which he baselessly claimed that there was vote fraud, without providing any evidence.

One of the first things I learned in my Buddism/Hinduism studies this year is that Westerners have a twisted perception of karma. Karma is more like spiritual thermodynamics: Every action, intent and deed a person does has an effect on their future. That future might happen now, or a lifetime from now, so it's really just better all around to stay on the side of good. Karma is not, as many have come to know it, a punishment or reward by an external force.
 Unless you happen to be Prudence Barnett.
 Prudence, a graduating sophomore at Fortuna Beach High, finds herself with the powers to exact such justice after performing a rousing karaoke version of John Lennon's "Instant Karma" and promptly getting knocked right on the head. She starts small, using her powers to give offenders their just deserts with a punishment comparable to the severity of the crime. What she would really love to do is get back at Quint Erickson, the boy in her class who tanked their last team assignment in marine biology. Pru is a stickler for both time and project management, and she can't bear to think that this less-than-perfect grade will mar her record. So she investigates this sea animal rescue center he seems to be obsessed with. Turns out, the center wasn't just made up on paper; Quint works there with his mom, Rosa, the owner.

These types of polls have a few significant things working to their advantage. Unlike election polls, they don’t have to worry about turnout modeling. Instead of trying to define a population ― the group of people who’ll end up voting in a specific election ― that doesn’t yet exist, they can instead rely on benchmarks like census data. And polling errors that would loom large in the context of a closely fought election may be less consequential when it comes to interpreting public opinion. Differences of 2 percentage points in election surveys can change the outcome, but a 2-point difference in opinion on an issue isn’t usually as substantial, especially if such results are correctly characterized as estimates.

US President Donald Trump visits his campaign headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, November 3, 2020. - A bitterly divided America was going to the polls on Tuesday amid the worst pandemic in a century and an economic crisis to decide whether to give President Donald Trump four more years or send Democrat Joe Biden to the White House. A record-breaking number of early votes -- more than 100 million -- have already been cast in an election that has the nation on edge and is being closely watched in capitals around the world.
