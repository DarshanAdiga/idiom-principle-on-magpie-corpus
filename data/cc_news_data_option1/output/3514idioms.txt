HARBOR SPRINGS — Northville’s Mike Anderson hit what he called high-quality golf shots down the stretch in winning the 38th GAM Mid-Amateur Championship Thursday at Boyne Highlands Resort.

  “So coming down the stretch, knowing the situation that I was in, it felt good because I hit a lot of high-quality shots. These guys are my peers and I enjoy playing with them and we compete against each other a lot, so to beat them once in a while is nice.”

 Our brave army men destroyed Indian tanks by wrapping bombs around their bodies and lying in front of heavy tanks adding this was the god gifted strength of our forces to crush their powerful enemy with less number and armaments.
 He said "I read the story of Major Shaheed Aziz Bhatti who stood like a rock in front of Indian artillery and kept sending information about the enemy's movement, embracing martyrdom at last from an artillery shell." "I am sure that the Indian forces had been surprised to witness the undeterred and firm commitment of our forces for the security of the motherland." The role of Pakistan Air Force, he said was also much fundamental as it provide a necessary support to the troops on ground from aerial attack.
 Our one of his kind PAF Pilot, Squadron Leader Muhammad Mahmood Alam shot down five Indian Air Force aircrafts in a single spell which has no precedent in the entire world.
 "I think it was the personal obsession for the motherland and indeed a help from Allah that MM Alam accurately hit and brought down Indian war aircrafts in the shortest possible time", he said.
 He said brave nations always remember the sacrifices of their national heroes and we also have to bear in mind our heroes from the Pakistan army and civilians who laid down their lives to protect the motherland from foreign aggression.

The global mental health apps market is expected to gain a significant lift over the forecast period due to increasing awareness regarding the importance of mental health. Mental health defines how a person thinks, feels and behaves. Mental health app offers cognitive behavioural therapy interventions for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and others. Through this app, individuals can conduct therapy sessions with authorised therapists. Nowadays, mental disorder is being considered as an important health condition, by the World Health Organization (WHO), hence, various mental health related campaigns and awareness campaigns are being held all across the globe. For instance, in January 2020, the Luxembourgish League for Mental Health launched a new awareness campaign in Luxembourg to assist individuals who feel they cannot take the steps to treat their mental health issues. The campaign, titled 'And if I were to talk to a therapist?' was designed to introduce the network of help and treatment for various mental health issues.

There are, of course, modern-life realities, such as paying bills. But Saad, who was spending the bulk of her time behind the scenes as a makeup artist, saw some compromises as too great.
 “I have a lot of Arab friends, and a lot of stuff they go out for is harmful — wife of terrorist,” she says. “I have been told multiple times by a lot of agents that that’s all I’m going to go out for because that’s all I am. I don’t want to tell that story. I don’t want to do that to my people. So I told myself a while back that I would rather not ruin my career that way, and make myself look bad and make my people look bad, to just book a couple hundred dollar job. It’s not worth it to have that trash on my résumé.”
 The strong-willed patience paid off.
 Saad in her first large role is the voice and personality behind the superhero known as Ms. Marvelin “Marvel’s Avengers,” the alter-ego of Kamala Khan, a Muslim Pakistani teenager from Jersey City. Khan hasn’t yet made her debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — Disney and Marvel announced last year that a “Ms. Marvel” series would be coming eventually on Disney+. Thus, Saad’s performance and Square Enix’s interpretation will be the first major cultural appearance by the character outside of the comics.

This week’s murder of two protestors in Kenoshia, Wisconsin by an outsider, “gun-toting, cop-worshipping teenage murderer,” is a harsh reality of law enforcement’s support of armed, right-wing militias,” says Branko Marcetic of the Jacobin.


  There are lots of examples of gun toting right wingers protected by police during the Black Lives Matter protests. The Gaslighter in Chief has embraced this right-wing protection racket!


  It is no accident that many swing states now find themselves in the throes of urban violence, not by peaceful protests, but by weaponized right-wing outsiders with the express purpose of starting trouble.


  Journalists, historians,and democratic elected officials warn of the accelerating creep of Trumpian authoritarianism. You’re not out of your mind. Psychological thoughts of uncertainty/anxiety are signaling that action is necessary.


  Historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat states that the greatest means to deal with gaslighting (abuse of power) is for voters to use “their electoral power to vote out these authoritarians while they [we] still can.”


  Trump’s gaslighting has led the country into a spiral of doubt, anger and despair. We were warned. “What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not happening,” taunts Trump.


  At the Republican National Convention (RNC) last week, “speaker after speaker piled lie upon lie to recast Trump as a saintly feminist preoccupied with the nation’s health. As Hurricane Laura roared toward the southern coast, the RNC unleashed Trump - Hurricane Liar”, writes David Smith of the Guardian.

“Yeah, we’re having to keep things pretty hush hush for now,” she said, adding that now that determining that a calendar will be produced is out of the way, the means by which it will be unveiled will now become the next level of concern.


  Usually, the new calendar is debuted for the public at the annual Thanksgiving dinner Hickory Woods hosts on the Saturday before that holiday. That event has attracted as many as 200 people.


  “We don’t know what we’re going to do for that this time,” she said, “We know we’re not going to be able to have that many (due to COVId-19 restrictions when it comes to crowd sizes). We haven’t quite gotten that far yet.”


  What is known is that Andrus, who has also become accomplished with video work, is expected to craft a video production related to the project at some time in the near future. Peeler described it as “a teaser, that will tell a little about it, but not too much.”


  Something else Peeler decided to unveil Thursday is that the popular bloopers segment that shows some of the more light moments behind the scenes will once again be part of the 14th edition. She said bloopers are also something that the people who have enjoyed this product, which include many who have never had a direct relationship with Hickory Woods, highly anticipate.


  “We hear from people all over the community that tell us they have a copy of all of them. They collect them,” she said. “They just buy them as keepsakes and they’ll say, ‘Oh! I’ve got to get one this year because I have every one of them anyway!’


  “That was another reason we didn’t want to not do it, because we knew we’d disappoint so many people.”

FOXBOROUGH -- This year has been such an anomaly, it wouldn't be entirely surprising if dinosaurs suddenly started roaming the earth again.


  That's sort of what's happening in Foxborough over the next three weeks, if you are willing to suspend disbelief for an hour or so.


  Starting Sept. 4 and running Wednesday through Sunday until Sept. 20, visitors to Gillette Stadium can drive among a herd of dinosaurs haling from the Cretaceous, Jurassic and Triassic Periods. On Thursday, there were already dinosaurs sighted grazing on the property across Rte. 1 from Gillette Stadium, including a Tyrannosaurus Rex, a Velociraptor and a Brontosaurus.


  It is all part of the Jurassic Quest drive-thru experience Gillette Stadium and Kraft Sports + Entertainment is hosting this month.


  "Jurassic Quest is the first event of its kind we've hosted, and we look forward to welcoming guests to this safe, educational and family-friendly experience beginning this Friday, Sept. 4," said Julia Pagliarulo, a spokeswoman for the Kraft organization.


  Jurassic Quest, which in normal times brings its dinosaurs to convention centers and arenas where tourists can walk among the titans of ancient earth, has catered the adventure to fit the social distancing requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic.


  Under COVID-19 conditions, "we put the dinosaurs back in their habitat," said Dustin Baker, a Jurassic Quest PR specialist, talking over the phone on Thursday. "Actually, it's a really cool experience to see the dinosaurs and see the trees and sky."


  In the drive-thru version of the prehistoric safari, "Jurassic Quest's herd of animatronic dinos are displayed in realistic scenes that allow guests to experience them roaring and moving from their own vehicles as they drive their way through the tour," Jurassic Quest rangers note on the event's website.


  The tour includes more than 70 dinosaurs, from small to gargantuan. All of the major dinosaur eras are represented, Baker said, "plus we also have a new portion of the exhibit which is aquatic reptiles" that are not technically considered dinosaurs but are equally as interesting prehistoric creatures, including a megalodon -- a colossal ancestor of modern sharks.


  There are also baby dinosaurs to see, carried around in the arms of Jurassic Quest park rangers for visitors to enjoy through their car windows. Additionally, a dino doctor is available during the tour for visitors to text their dinosaur questions to.


  During the drive-thru experience, guests are guided by a digital audio tour featuring dino park rangers and wranglers.


  All of the dinosaurs are life-sized, created in collaboration with paleontologists based on the details offered up by the fossil record.


  "Whether their prehistoric counterpart had skin that was scaly, had feathers or fur, Jurassic Quest has spared no expense in bringing the dinosaurs to life," the rangers note.


  Jurassic Quest was conceived in 2013 and eventually brought to realization by Dan and Leticia Arnold and their family of Spring, Texas. It is now touted as the largest immersive, animatronic dinosaur experience in North America.


  "It was a family that just loved dinosaurs and thought, 'whoah, wouldn't it be cool to have an immersive experience?'" said Baker, because most of the time when people visit museums, it's the articulated skeletons that are on display, along with diorama scenes featuring smaller replicas of the animals.


  Baker said it's one thing to view dinosaur bones and replicas in a museum, "it's another thing to actually feel like you're looking at the animal in real life."


  Pagliarulo said the dinosaur herd is set up in Parking Lot P10, across Rte. 1 from the stadium.


  "The experience takes approximately 70 to 90 minutes, and guests will drive through the different exhibits accompanied by an educational and fun audio tour," she said via email.


  As part of the tour, visitors receive a free, safari-style family photo in their vehicles against a dinosaur backdrop. Explorers may also opt for tour add-ons, including an "Explorer Pack" that has three dinosaur surprises, a "Tracker Pack" that has three dinosaur surprises and crafts and activities to do at home, and a "Trainer Pack" that includes five dinosaur surprises plus crafts and activities to do at hom


  The drive-thru Jurassic Quest at Gillette Stadium, 1 Patriot Place, Foxborough, will be open 11 a.m.-8 p.m. on opening day, Sept. 4, and from 9 a.m.-8 p.m. on Wednesdays through Sundays until Sept. 20. There are no tours on Mondays and Tuesdays.


  Tickets are available online only at JurassicQuest.com/events/drive-thru- boston -- there will be no tickets available at the gate. Guests can purchase drive-thru tickets for an assigned time slot for $49 per vehicle, and $80 for passenger vehicles that seat 9-15 people. Motorcycles and similar vehicles are not permitted at Jurassic Quest.


  Jurassic Quest and Gillette Stadium staff will be on-hand to ensure all proper social distancing guidelines are being followed.

Looking at the current portfolio, PetroChina’s carbon emissions intensity is noticeably lower than many of its IOC and NOC peers. Production is predominantly onshore, with limited exposure to deepwater and LNG (though the latter is rising). Yes, this makes near-zero look more straightforward, but a ‘do nothing’ approach to reducing emissions isn’t on the cards. With President Xi’s push to expand domestic output and to grow overseas, PetroChina must look to boost output.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. unemployment rate fell sharply in August to 8.4% from 10.2% even as hiring slowed, with employers adding the fewest jobs since the pandemic began.


  Employers added 1.4 million jobs, the Labor Department said, down from 1.7 million in July. The U.S. economy has recovered about half the 22 million jobs lost to the pandemic.


  Friday’s report added to evidence that nearly six months after the coronavirus paralyzed the country, the economy is mounting only a fitful recovery. From small businesses to hotels, restaurants, airlines and entertainment venues, a wide spectrum of companies are struggling to survive the loss of customers with confirmed viral cases still high.


  After an epic collapse in the spring, when the economy shrank at a roughly 30% annual rate, growth has been rebounding as states have reopened at least parts of their economies. Yet the recovery remains far from complete.


  Many economists think significant hiring may be hard to sustain because employers are operating under a cloud of uncertainty about the virus. Daily confirmed case counts have fallen from 70,000 in June to about 40,000. The decline has levelled off in the past week and the viral caseload remains higher than it was in May and June.


  As a result activities like restaurant dining and air travel are still far below pre-pandemic levels. Most economists say a meaningful economic recovery will likely be impossible until the coronavirus is brought under control, most likely from the widespread use of a vaccine.


  Friday’s jobs data was the second-to-last employment report — for most voters, the most visible barometer of the economy — before Election Day, Nov. 3. President Donald Trump faces the daunting task of seeking re-election in the worst economic downturn since the 1930s. Yet voters in surveys have generally given him higher marks on the economy than they have on other aspects of his presidency.


  The jobs report coincides with growing signs that more companies are making permanent job cuts rather than temporary furloughs. That trend could keep the unemployment rate persistently high. It is typically harder for an unemployed worker to find a new job at a new company or in a new industry than to return to a previous employer.


  Casino and hotel operator MGM Resorts, slammed by declines in travel and tourism, said last week that it's eliminating 18,000 jobs. Coca Cola, which derives half its sales from stadiums, theatres and other venues that have been largely shut down, is offering buyouts to 4,000 employees. Salesforce said it is cutting 1,000 jobs. Bed, Bath & Beyond will shed 2,800.


  A Federal Reserve report this week based on anecdotal reports from businesses found “rising instances of furloughed workers being laid off permanently as demand remained soft.”


  Roughly 29 million Americans are receiving state unemployment aid, although their total benefits, on average, have shrunk by more than half since the expiration of a $600-a-week federal supplement more than a month ago. The Trump administration has set up a program that will provide some of the unemployed with $300 a week.

“Our biggest strength is that these guys are all together in this and we don’t necessarily have people in it for themselves,” Rosa said. “They are in it for each other and with that mindset, we can do some really good things. Another positive thing will be that we have size, which will help quite a bit on set pieces and corner kicks. I would like to think we are really dangerous there.”


  They will start the season off with a true test against their district foe and the reigning first region champions, Marshall County. With the uncertainty of this season being at the forefront for the last few months, the players are anxiously ready to get the season started.


  “I have had to hold some of them back by the collars,” Rosa said. “They are ready to go. With an elongated preseason, no scrimmage games and only just recently being able to game simulate, they are ready for competition.”


  Even though they are without several starters from last season, the belief is that experience from last season will carry over for the juniors and seniors that saw time on the field. More importantly, they learned how to play competitively from the senior class as the team lost by just one goal in six of their eight losses.


  “Last year’s team was great, there were so many games last season we were in it until the end,” Rosa said. “We won some and lost some, but I am hoping, with this crop of upperclassmen, that the experience may push them over the top and we can really make some runs this year.”


  The 13-game schedule runs from Sept. 8 to Oct. 8. and features games against Calloway County (2), Graves County (2), Mayfield, UHA, Logan County, Paducah Tilghman, Madisonville-North Hopkins, Russellville and a team out of Evansville, Indiana.

This means millions of families in need of benefits to make ends meet while Congress continues to argue about the next stimulus package.


  During the Republican National Convention last week, President Donald Trump promised to create 10 million new jobs in 10 months. If the predictions hold true, he'll have 8.6 million more to go — and even then, the US economy wouldn't have gained back all the jobs lost since February.


  Trump's promise could prove difficult to achieve. The recovery is losing steam as the sugar rush from stimulus wears off, millions of people are still working from home, and retail, restaurants and other services industries remain battered from the pandemic.

Thomas knows how that works. He was the No. 1 seed a year ago, opened with a 70 and was in a three-way tie for the lead after one day. The rest of the week didn't go much better. But while he witnessed McIlroy winning from five shots behind at the start, a 10-shot deficit looks feasible only on paper.


  "It would be one thing if they were 10 back of one person,” Thomas said. “But there's 25 people ahead of them, and that's the hard part. I think if you gave me even par and you gave ‘X’ player at 10-under par and it was just us two, I think I'd have a better chance of catching him."


  More likely, at least this year, is a scenario the PGA Tour has tried to avoid — a runaway with no drama.


  Nothing will be as bad as 2008 when the format allowed Vijay Singh to wrap it up no matter how he played at East Lake. He needed to stay upright for only four days, and the Fijian managed fine.


  Johnson, however, is playing as well as anyone, and he's arguably the biggest talent in the game. He has had the 54-hole lead in his last three tournaments, winning at the TPC Boston and finishing runner-up in the PGA Championship and BMW Championship. Imagine if he gets it going at East Lake while staked to a two-shot lead.


  Kevin Kisner still thinks the odds are a winner from the bottom of the pack is more likely to happen before someone from the top wins in a landslide.


  “DJ could shoot 9 under tomorrow and run away and it would be a total snoozer,” Kisner said. “But I just think there's too many good players near the top. Ten shots is surmountable over four days if somebody gets really hot.”


  Horschel and Hughes at least have that chance. Horschel secured the 30th and final position, but only because Corey Conners four-putted the final hole at Olympia Fields (the last three putts from 5 feet). Hughes cracked the top 30 by making a 5-foot par putt on his last hole.


  It all starts to unfold Friday, and there is plenty on the line for everyone, mostly money. The $15 million payout — $14 million in cash, $1 million deferred — is only part of the $45.6 million in bonus money being paid out this week.


  It still has to be earned. A year ago, Cantlay was the No. 2 seed and didn't break par in any of the four rounds . He slipped to No. 28, which was worth $415,000. Whoever finishes second earns $5 million.

“Rather than creating a shot-by-shot remake of the [animated film], the creators decided to go back to the original ballad [of Hua Mulan] and create a live-action adaptation [of that],” said An, also in March. (None of the actors interviewed for this story were made available for follow-up interviews.)
 “There’s a few new characters to help bring forth themes that are more relevant to audiences today because 20 years have passed,” he continued. “And because of that, I was given free rein to collaborate with Niki and to come up with this Honghui character. Because fans are passionate about Mulan, there are going to be differences in opinions. It’s not a good thing and it’s not a bad thing. It just means that there’s passion there.”
 “It wasn’t really, ‘We’ll start out with the animation and choose to leave things out,’ ” Caro said. “It was the opposite of that. When you have the opportunity to make something in live action, you have the opportunity to make it real. So the starting point was really, ‘What is that journey? What makes a young woman leave her home, travel across an entire continent, disguise herself as a man and go to war?’ And in order to tell that we went back to the DNA of the original ballad.
 “It takes a strong strength of character to stay strong to the original vision,” she added. “But I was very lucky that the vision was shared by the studio. We really had to honor our commitment to this epic retelling and to the idea that if we did our jobs well enough, we could reinterpret this beloved story for a new audience and a new time. I liken it to a kind of coming of age for that audience whose childhoods Mulan defined. I hope that the live-action can sort of [represent] a coming of age into adulthood [for them].”

It might also be worth revisiting The Gambia’s request that Myanmar be ordered to cooperate with UN fact-finding bodies, which the Court deemed unnecessary in its January Order (para. 62), in order to ensure that action purportedly taken by the Burmese authorities in compliance with the Order is in line with international standards. Access to Myanmar is currently limited due to legitimate restrictions placed by the government to control the spread of Covid-19 but historically, the government has not cooperated with the investigative endeavours of the UN Special Rapporteur and the Fact-Finding Mission and has also restricted humanitarian access to conflict-affected areas since January 2019. The impact of the internet blackout on the gathering and dissemination of information further undermines investigative efforts. In a recent resolution, the Human Rights Council called on the Burmese government to better cooperate and provide unfettered access to UN human rights mechanisms, including the Special Rapporteur and the FFM’s successor, the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. However, this resolution is not binding and in light of the historical precedent, a binding obligation (such as a provisional measure) would be a more effective means by which to secure Myanmar’s cooperation.

“I’m not kidding, we have had as many as five calls for that one barn in one day. We’ve literally not made it back to (CCFR Station No. 1 in Murray) when dispatch gets another call and we have to head back.”


  Here is the other thing Morgan wants people to understand, though. Whether or not there is strong reason to suspect the call will be for a barn not on fire, CCFR not only answers every call, they do so as if it is the real thing, complete with its vehicles traveling high speeds with emergency lights and sirens fully activated.


  “We have to go check it out because we can be held liable, especially if it’s for something that damages other stuff,” Morgan said, explaining this how it is for all calls CCFR receives. “We respond to what we’re dispatched to, whether they tell us that it’s an actual fire or fire alarm. We treat it like a real fire because, until somebody is (on the scene), we don’t know what it is. Now, sometimes we are canceled before we get there.


  “I had a lady call me the other day and she was fussing about one of our (pumper) trucks because one of the guys had passed her going down the road and a couple of miles down, he turned (all lights) off and turned around and came back (toward Murray). She told me how bad he was, how he was misusing his lights and she thought he shouldn’t be risking riding on the road like that. I told her, ‘Ma’am, that was for a fire alarm and the homeowner had called us to say everything was OK.’


  “It’s the same thing with a tobacco barn call. One of our (volunteers in a personal vehicle) or the farmer can cancel us before we get there, but we are always going to respond with one of our big trucks first because, what if we do pull up with a (brush unit or support unit) and it really is on fire? Then what are we going to do?”


  Morgan said the best-case scenario is for the farmer or a CCFR volunteer to observe the barn in question and relay that all is well before larger trucks leave their stations. Volunteers are scattered throughout the county, he said, and he added that, over the years, CCFR has come to know several of the county’s farmers so well that it has them on speed dial so they can be asked about the current status of their barns.


  “But they’re not always at the barns,” he said.

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 04th September, 2020) Growing up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the 1970s, Deborah Tyler Haywood began to take part in local protests over fair housing for the African Americans living in the city at the time.
 "We did a lot of protesting for fair housing when landlords didn't let people into different housing. In the late 1960s and 1970s, black people were only allowed to live on the north side of town. They weren't able to go to south side. So we marched against that," Haywood, a 50-year-old African American who teaches black history in a local high school today, told Sputnik during a phone interview.
 When mass protests broke out in Kenosha, Wisconsin in late August over the shooting of an African American man by the local police, Haywood said she shared the frustrations of the protesters and understood the reasons behind some of the violence that took place during the protests.
 "I think the reason that it [the protests] got so violent was because this has been a situation that has been a long time coming. People have lived under this racism since we marched back in the 1970s. The things they're marching about now are the same things we marched about in the 1970s. And nothing has changed. When you have people that have been held back or pressed down for so long, they become more aggressive because they're tired of it. The systematic racism and the way black people are treated by the police, especially in Wisconsin, because Wisconsin is one of the most segregated states in the country," she said.
 However, despite her support for the protests against racial injustices and police brutality, Haywood was not convinced that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden could resolve all the issues and concerns from the protesters. Instead, she said she would vote for incumbent US president Donald Trump during the upcoming election in November.
 After mass protests against racial injustices and police brutality broke out in a number of cities in the United States in May following the death of George Floyd, the unrest has been largely viewed as a boost to Biden's chances of winning the election in November, as Trump continued to express strong support for the police and condemned the protests as riots. Polling results in the weeks following the protests showed Biden extended his lead over Trump.
 During the Democratic Convention in late August, Biden spoke out against racial injustices and echoed the signature "Black Lives Matter" slogan that is often heard during the protests. Biden's campaign has also unveiled a number of initiatives aimed at improving racial equality of the US economy and addressing concerns from the black community.
 As violence escalated during recent protests in Kenosha and Portland, where deadly shootings took place in recent weeks, Trump doubled down on his support for the police and continued to call on his supporters, who are mostly white, to stage counter protests. The deadly shootings in both cities took place as a result of confrontations between Trump supporters and the protesters.
 During his visit to Kenosha on Tuesday, Trump focused on the violence and destruction caused by the protests and refused to meet with the family members of the police shooting victim Jacob Blake. Biden visited Kenosha on Thursday and met with Blake's family members in addition to stopping by areas damaged during the protests.
 But for African American voters like Haywood, although she found Trump's rhetoric questionable, she warned that Biden and the Democratic Party probably shouldn't take support from the black voters for granted.
 "You have Joe Biden who says things like, 'you're not black if you don't vote for me.' That makes you think that the Democrats think that they got the black vote fold up. It makes me think that maybe I should not be voting for you if you're taking my vote for granted," she said.
 The teacher of black history isn't convinced about how progressive the Democratic Party truly is.
 "If you're progressive party, you wouldn't have a 70-year-old white man [as your presidential candidate]. You had 10-15 people running for president out of the Democratic Party. And then you settled on this older white man. If they were the party of inclusion, their candidate should look like something different. You've got to make changes that we can see," she said.
 Nevertheless, Haywood explained that she was not satisfied with responses from both Biden and Trump.
 "I'm disappointed in both parties because neither one of them has really sat down with common black people to give a true perspective of what's going on in the cities. You have Joe Biden, who says the right things a lot of the times. But he's got almost 50 years of doing nothing for black people in government. He has to tip the scale. Then you have Trump. He has created jobs and opportunity zones. He has done a little bit more than a lot of the presidents before him. But he also says plenty of dissension when he tweets things that are questionable as to what he's thinking. He's not doing things to bring people together," she said.
 Unlike most US voters who usually follow their allegiance to either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party when voting for a president, Haywood has never pledged loyalty to either of the two parties. She would evaluate all the candidates individually and then decide who she would support during a specific election.
 During the elections in 2008 and 2012, Haywood voted for Barack Obama from the Democratic Party. But in the election in 2016, she switched her support for Trump from the Republican Party because she felt an outsider like him could bring more changes than a career politician like Hilarity Clinton from the Democratic Party.
 The high school teacher said she would always hold a family meeting before each election to debate the pros and cons of each presidential candidate.
 "I had to sit down with my family and we had to go through the options. We do that with every election. We talk about what that person had stood for. We talk about what their actions have been. We talk about what their meaning is in our lives. We sit down and we make a list of pros and cons. It's the same with this election," she said.
 Because of the Electoral College system of the US presidential election, victories in swing states like Wisconsin, where voters switch support from one party to the other during different elections, usually could decide who wins the presidency.

I truly look forward to having him leading our county road department and believe the county’s taxpayers will be well served.”


  Edmonds’ first act in this position will be to determine road needs that still remain to be corrected and to prioritize them based on community safety and esthetic corrections. The idea is to place these needs in files by utilizing the Calloway Road Improvement Safety Plan (CRISP), so the work is more efficient and timely .


  Accordingly, Edmonds has short-term and long-term goals for the road department.


  “My short term goals are to place the personnel in various positions to allow them to perform their duties to the greatest efficiency,” Edmonds said. “Work scheduling will be done to accomplish the greatest return in relation to man hours and work finished. In the long term, this will allow the county to accomplish our work in the most economical manner and provide a good and continuing return on investment for the county in performing the road department duties.


  “It will be great to be home every night and to return to my home county.”

When we first meet Khan at a Comic-Con-like event celebrating the heroes — one that will soon blow up and level part of San Francisco — she’s a teen wanting to create an “Avengers” comic. She’s also told, point-blank, by her peers that she has no part in an “Avengers” narrative. A charmingly goofy Thor (Travis Willingham) watches Khan stand her ground, and we’re introduced to a kid who is tired of hearing the word “no” and only becomes more bullheaded, more determined to find a place of optimism, because of it.
 The game’s director, Shaun Escayg, says he knew that Saad should be the game’s Khan when watching her reactions between audition takes, picking up on a sense of surprise at her own abilities. “She did her read, and it was amazing,” Escayg says. “She sounded so bubbly and so fresh, but in-between takes, she was just, ‘Did I ... did I do that?’ You saw that behind the scenes she was a genuinely positive person. You can’t craft that. That just comes out of you.”

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 04th September, 2020) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has privately given a green light to the US Administration's plan to provide the United Arab Emirates with weapons, US media reported.


  In August, the office of Netanyahu issued a statement saying that the Israeli-UAE peace deal did not include Tel Aviv's consent to US arms deliveries to the UAE. The prime minister was said to oppose deliveries of F-35 fighters and other modern weapons to Arab nations, including those which signed peace deals with Israel.


  The New York Times newspaper reported on late Thursday citing its sources that the public statement of Netanyahu's office was not true. According to the sources, Netanyahu gave up his complaints against the possible arms deal after the talks with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo conducted in Jerusalem last week.

Now even big men shoot 3s, as teams prioritize pace and spacing the floor rather than pounding the ball into the paint.


  Nash should have a team talented enough to do all that. Not only should Durant and Irving be recovered from their surgeries, but players such as rising star Caris LeVert, Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris — assuming he is re-signed — would all fit nicely.


  Unless Nash springs another surprise and plays another style.


  “He might go back to a traditional two bigs, I don’t know,” D'Antoni joked. “He might just walk it up and the floor and throw it to his big center, so who knows.”


  The Nets finished the season under Jacque Vaughn and said he would remain on staff as Nash's lead assistant.


  The Nets reached the postseason despite having Irving for only 20 games and Durant for none, but the two stars who came to Brooklyn together last summer are expected to be ready for the 2020-21 season.


  That made the Nets' vacancy an attractive position, and general manager Sean Marks said he met with a number of highly accomplished candidates. There was even speculation the Nets would try to entice Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, for whom Marks played and then worked under in San Antonio.


  Instead, Marks turned to one of his former teammates.


  “In Steve we see a leader, communicator and mentor who will garner the respect of our players," Marks said. “I have had the privilege to know Steve for many years. One of the great on-court leaders in our game, I have witnessed firsthand his basketball acumen and selfless approach to prioritize team success.”


  Vaughn finished the season after the Nets surprisingly parted with Kenny Atkinson on March 7. He led Brooklyn to the No. 7 seed in the Eastern Conference despite coming to the restarted season in Disney without many of his top players and Marks had indicated he would be a candidate to keep the job.


  Vaughn will instead go back to his former position as a Nets assistant. He becomes the fourth coach to lose a head coaching job since being eliminated at Disney and three of them were Black. Indiana fired Nate McMillan and New Orleans dismissed Alvin Gentry, leaving five Black coaches and four current openings in the 30-team league.


  “Jacque has been an integral part of our program and a key contributor to the growth and development of our entire organization," Marks added. “His role in developing our players both on and off the court and his influence driving our culture have been invaluable.”


  Nash grew up in Victoria, British Columbia, playing for Canada from 1993 to 2004 and later serving as general manager of its senior national team from 2012-19.


  Both of New York's NBA teams have made splashy coaching hires this summer. The Knicks hired former Coach of the Year Tom Thibodeau.

However, officials who spoke to the Times contradicted his public statements.


  American officials insisted that the deal was not a direct reward for the UAE agreeing to recognize Israel, but said the country's agreement had softened US opposition to such sales.


  The deal still faces an uphill climb in Congress, due to laws against weapons sales that weaken Israel's advantage, according to the Times.


  Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the US, said in a statement that it is "not true" that Netanyahu has signed off on the sale. Dermer added he remains confident the Trump administration "is fully committed to maintaining" the Israeli military advantage.


  Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, told the Times he had heard from sources in all three nations that the Israeli PM had approved the sale but needed to save face.


  "I've heard it from parties on all three sides that he gave a green light on this," he was quoted as saying.

“Yifei was so focused throughout the whole thing,” An said. “To keep up the physicality of being a warrior, we would train even after 10 to 12 hours of filming for two hours in the evening, then eat and sleep. It was really like going to war, but it was fun. And seeing her in the preparation process, I’m like, ‘OK, this girl is Mulan. There’s no one else that can do what she’s doing.’”
 Because of the heightened demands of her role, Liu trained separately while the rest of the cast trained as a group. “It was pretty intense,” she said modestly.
 The actress also credited the amount of effort that went into helping her behind the scenes. “The homework and the research that [the film crew] did is insane,” she said. “When you put on the costume, you actually believed that you were living in that period of time. That’s respect.”
 “You could see that she was so focused,” Lee said. “The way she moved with a sword surprised me. I thought it was just so fluid and graceful. And then seeing her on horseback; she could ride a horse better than the guys. She took everything and she did everything so well. I’m like, ‘Damn, she has no fear.’ She _is_ Mulan in my eyes.”
