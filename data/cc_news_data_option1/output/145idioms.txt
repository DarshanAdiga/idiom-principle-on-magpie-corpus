A conservative media commentator who was crowned Mrs. Florida 2016 is headed to prison after a federal judge on Thursday said he wanted to send a message that if you steal from the U.S. government, you're going to jail.
   
 Unless Karyn Turk can convince an appeals court that she doesn't deserve to spend a month behind bars for stealing her elderly mother's Social Security checks instead of using the money to pay for nursing home care, the Highland Beach resident must report to prison on March 2.
   
 Turk's looming jail sentence -- to be followed by five months of house arrest -- was ordered by U.S. Magistrate Bruce Reinhart after a contentious hearing.
   
 He also ordered Turk to perform 100 hours of community service at a nursing home -- a reminder of the time she never spent with her own mother who spent three years in a Lake Worth facility, ravaged by Alzheimer's disease.
   
 While Turk didn't show any reaction to Reinhart's decision, she and her lawyers sought to convince him that she has suffered enough and didn't deserve house arrest, much less prison time.
   
 Since pleading guilty in September to a misdemeanor charge of Social Security fraud, she has been attacked on social media, said her attorney David Tarras.
   
 Turk, who last year was named champion of the year by Best Buddies, a teen mentoring group, has lost her position on various philanthropic groups, he said.
   
 The damage to her reputation and her status in political, business and social circles has been enormous, he said.
   
 Without the ability to hob-nob in the community, travel to interview celebrities for YouTube broadcasts and to host fundraisers, like those she held for now convicted political operative Roger Stone, her career is dead, he said.
   
 "Her livelihood is based on networking and being a social media commentator," Tarras said.
   
 Besides, he argued, she came to court with a check for $46,000 to reimburse the government for the money she stole. That, he said, should be enough.
   
 Reinhart disagreed. While noting that Turk had lived an otherwise law-abiding life and done good works, he said her crime was a serious one. She shouldn't be able to "buy her way out of jail" by simply writing a check, he said.
   
 "Choices in life have consequences, I'm sorry to tell you," Reinhart said. "If you steal from the government, you're not going to have a reputation as an honest person."
   
 As a social media commentator with a large following, he said she was well- placed to send an important message to others who might follow in her footsteps.
   
 "The message I'm sending is: You can't steal from the government and not go to jail," Reinhart said.
   
 His decision was welcomed by roughly a half-dozen employees of the Finnish American Rest Home who cared for Turk's elderly mother until she died in July at age 83. While they said nothing during the hearing, outside the courtroom, they said they were relieved.
   
 "Resident exploitation is a serious crime and I'm glad he recognized that," said Daniel Benson, executive director of the 45-bed nursing home.
   
 Instead of using her mother's Social Security, Veterans Administration and pension checks to cover $219,000 in nursing home bills, Turk used the money to pay for shopping sprees, dinners out and for a nanny to watch her children, according to Palm Beach County sheriff's Detective Vaughn Mitchell.
   
 The loss over three years hurt, Benson said. "We rely on the money for staff raises, to update equipment, for our operations," he said. "It's a significant amount for a small nonprofit."
   
 Some of her mother's expenses would have been covered by Medicare if Turk had filled out the necessary paperwork. But, despite constant requests, Turk refused, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Adrienne Rabinowitz.
   
 The nursing home even went to court to try to force Turk to pay up. While a Palm Beach County circuit judge in August 2018 ordered Turk to pay $250 a month to defray the mounting bill, Turk still didn't do it, Rabinowitz said.
   
 Sadly, she said, the circuit judge also ordered Turk to buy clothes for her mother instead of leaving it to the nursing home.
   
 "I think it says a lot about who this person is when you have to be ordered to buy your mother clothes," Rabinowitz said.
   
 Attorney Guy Fronstin, who also represents Turk, said he plans to appeal. He said he will ask that she not be required to report to prison until the appeal is decided.
   
 While Turk faced a maximum year-long sentence, he questioned whether Reinhart could send Turk to prison for a month to "send a message."
   
 Reinhart said one of the biggest mysteries is why Turk, who is married to an attorney and touts an upscale lifestyle, stole the money.
   
 Tarras said Turk couldn't explain her actions because of ongoing litigation with the nursing home and her legal battle to retain control of her mother's estate.
   
 She is suing the nursing home, claiming its negligence led to her mother's death. It is suing her and her mother's estate to recover the money it claims it is owed.
   
 Meanwhile, a judge last week gave her late mother's court-appointed guardian the go-ahead to try and remove Turk as personal representative of the estate. Turk's criminal conviction figured prominently in that decision.
   
 While emphasizing that a circuit judge should decide if Turk retains control of her mother's estate, Reinhart barred her from having control over anyone's money.
   
 For her part, Turk initially tried to downplay her misdeeds. Later, she acknowledged that she broke the law.
   
 "I'm doing everything I can to redeem myself and move forward as a good citizen," she said.

SANTA ROSA BEACH -- Local nonprofit Fore Her announces its sixth annual Tea Fore Her, presented by Platinum Pink Sponsor Emerald Coast Hospice, will be at 1 p.m. Feb. 9 at the Vue on 30A. Guests will enjoy tea and lunch while raising funds for breast cancer patients along the Emerald Coast.
   
 During the event there will be a silent auction, photo booth, a complimentary glass of champagne and more. Hats are encouraged for a chance to win the "Best Hat" prize. New this year, guests will enjoy complimentary valet parking sponsored by Pizza by the Sea. Tickets, available at ForeHer.org, are $50 per person, $45 for breast cancer survivors and $35 for children 12 and under.
   
 Fore Her has expanded into a far-reaching organization for breast cancer patients, using three signature fundraising events, Tea Fore Her, The Fore Her Golf Outing, and the Pink Walk, to financially assist local individuals diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing treatment. Funds raised are used to ease the financial burden by providing temporary assistance with bills such as mortgage or rent payments, utilities or helping pay for auto repairs so patients can get to treatments.
   
 "I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a double mastectomy in January 2019," said Pam Knapp, a recent Fore Her recipient. "Then in April 2019, I fell and fractured my spine. I was off work for six weeks in a back brace, only to find out the fracture was not healing. More testing found two tumors on my spine. After back surgery, another six weeks off of work, and medicals bills escalating, a friend told me about Fore Her. They generously helped me get caught up on my bills. Without them I would still be buried financially. I am very grateful for their financial and emotional support."
   
 Fore Her offers resources, hope, compassion and education for all who are affected by breast cancer. Find additional information about volunteering, available resources, and how you can help, visit ForeHer.org. For sponsorship opportunities, email info@thehivecreativeconsulting.com.
   
 "When I speak with all of our applicants, I'm not sure who is more emotional, me or them," said Ginny Richerson, Fore Her board member. "Each and every one of these ladies are so grateful to talk to a fellow survivor. The money we raise at this event helps us provide the additional encouragement they need to continue to have hope."

 The man, 47-year-old Damon Becnel of Destin, was charged Jan. 2 with child cruelty and cruelty to animals.
 According to his Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office arrest report, on Dec. 24 the child reported that she was physically abused the day before by Becnel and provided video of the incident to investigators.
 The video shows the victim and two dogs in a bedroom. While the dog is on the bed, Becnel can be seen pulling out a knife and threatening the dog while yelling, \"I will cut this (expletives deleted) dog's eyeballs out, I'll (expletive deleted) do it,\" the arrest report said.
 Becnel later could be seen striking the dog and grabbing it by the throat and throwing it to the floor while the child yells at him to stop.
 He also allegedly grabbed the victim by the hair and pushed her head toward the bed, where it struck the bed frame.
 The report said Becnel later re-engaged the victim and struck her in the head, causing it to bounce off the wall.
 Becnel will appear before a judge on Feb. 4.

Houseplants can have us gardening year-round. They add a decorative touch to a home, and they emit oxygen and help remove toxins to purify the air.      Shopping for your first houseplant or adding more to your collection can be an exciting experience. How does one choose a houseplant? I look for ones with interesting texture, foliage and form. More importantly does it appear healthy. Here are some tips when shopping for a houseplant and for maintaining it.      • CHOOSING A PLANT - Look for plants with healthy green foliage and dense, bushy growth. One with an abundance of closed buds is a better choice than one in full bloom. Always check for insects at the tips of new branches, at the places where the leaves join the stems and on the underside of the leaves.   • LIGHT - Plants grown only for attractive foliage require less light. Succulents or cacti and flowering plants require direct sunlight. Succulents and cacti do make ideal houseplants since indoors the humidity is dry, and they prefer that kind of environment.   • SPACE - Plants grow at different rates. For immediate gratification in a small area, Norfolk Pine, Dracena Marginata, Fiddle Leaf Fig tree, Schefflera and Rubber Tree are some serious contenders for making a statement in a small space.   • INDOOR TEMPERATURE - Many houseplants are tropical in origin, so they prefer high humidity. If you are in a climate where humidity is low indoors, you can raise the humidity several ways. Misting plants, keeping pots on water-filled trays or grouping plants near one another to trap existing moisture can help raise the humidity for houseplants.   • WATERING - The biggest problem is overwatering houseplants. Choose a container with good drainage. Add water to the top of the soil surface until water comes out the drainage holes. Or watering can be done by placing the pot into a container filled with water and leave it remain in the container for fifteen minutes. Tepid water is best for watering to avoid shocking plants and causing them to wilt.   • FEEDING - Read the care tag on the plant for fertilizing and keeping your plant healthy. If you are unsure about the feeding of a particular houseplant, experts at your local garden center or floral shop should be able to provide answers to your questions.   • MAINTENANCE - Plant foliage should be rinsed under a gentle stream of tepid water about every two weeks to remove dust or dirt. Larger plants may be harder to rinse, so with a soft, clean cloth, gently wipe the foliage. As you wipe the leaves, use your other hand to support the undersides of the leaves.   Keeping me company in my home are a variety of houseplants. They all have interesting foliage, texture and some even flower. A mini cactus, a dracaena, an English ivy, a bromeliad, an orchid, a kalanchoe and a bird's nest fern comprise my indoor garden.      Maybe you too will find a spot on your kitchen windowsill for a small succulent or an empty space for a beautiful orchid beside your bedside. Houseplants will reward you daily.

Seventy percent of college students graduated with debt last year--on average $30,000. Some will repay that debt with Social Security checks voluntarily or through garnishment. Of Americans over 60, 2.8 million have student loans, and 73% of those are cosigners paying for children or grandchildren.
   
 Something is broken. Pell Grants, formerly the solution for qualifying families, covered 79% of tuition and fees in 1975 but only 29% by 2017--a downhill slide caused by escalating costs, easy government loans and no public demand for matching value increases. Some studies suggest borrowing yields an increase in credits earned and academic performance. I don't care what those studies show. Borrowing more is bad; borrowing less is good. Borrowing nothing is best.
   
 Community colleges revolutionized higher education. It started with Joliet Junior College in 1901, and JJC proudly retains its junior college name and mission. Traditionally, these institutions were free or nearly so. Many have wandered off the path. In Texas, the average debt for graduates was $9,500 for public and $13,000 for private community colleges. Laredo College has the lowest debt level at $2,332. The most indebted graduates owe $33,828 from the private for-profit American Intercontinental University in Houston. If that doesn't startle you, you are not paying attention. The value equation does not work.
   
 These debt levels are for graduates. More disconcerting are the nearly 3.9 million students who drop out of college or community college with no degree, but over $7,000 debt on average. That stinks.
   
 I have visited 132 high schools (public, charter, private and for profit) in Texas' top 46 counties talking with thousands of students, teachers and leaders. The schools range in size from 12 to thousands, and many have a deep culture of pragmatism learned from their families and communities. This is particularly so in smaller community-based schools in places like Texline, Booker, Klondike, Guthrie and all points in between. Many students bring that native pragmatism with them to WT, and it strengthens the University. I feel a moral obligation to recognize pragmatism with pragmatism. To those multiplied thousands of students I said, "Do not borrow money to attend West Texas A&M; University for the first two years. If you must borrow, go to a community college. Amarillo College, Frank Phillips College, Clarendon College, South Plains College and Western Texas College are all good places to start. Don't borrow a red cent for community college either. Pay as you go."
   
 Community colleges were founded and designed to be low cost, no frills, and open access. If it takes four years to get an associate degree with no debt, do that. Make sure courses transfer by contacting the university you plan to attend. Transfer to a place like West Texas A&M; University that appreciates community college graduates and their academic experience carrying a ledger with little or no red ink.
   
 Resist the faddish advice that a degree must take four or six years to complete. This preoccupation by universities, ranking agencies, state bureaucracies and elected officials as a means to measure perceived quality is over-valued for most institutions. In 1930 the average life expectancy of a U.S. Citizen was 60; it is 80 now. If a single mom requires eight years to get a bachelor's degree, is that a loss for the state, the university or the individual? Certainly not if the graduate incurs little or no debt.
   
 Lastly, if someone must borrow at all, never borrow more than 60% of the anticipated starting salary of the first job. Check the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you want to teach school in a smaller community in Texas and the starting salary is $40,000, don't borrow more than $24,000 to attain your bachelor's degree. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board appropriately recommends this 60% rule.
   
 Any leader in any walk of life who tells any potential student that borrowing without qualification is OK displays ignorance and should not be trusted. Too many people in too many places for too many purposes tell students and parents, "Whatever the cost of the degree, it is worth it. It will all work out." It's a lie, and unless those individuals will cosign the note, it's disingenuous.
   
 I have been called, "The Dave Ramsey of higher education." I'll own that. A degree attained with little or no borrowing will have more value than any degree with a passel of promissory notes draped around the graduate's neck like a string of poison posies.
   
 If you are interested in attending college and do not hear these admonitions on campus, leave immediately. Do not attend orientation. Do not enroll in courses. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.
   
 Be a pragmatist.

“There are approximately 1,800 licensed PAs in Kentucky,” Sheldon said. “Kentucky has 202 health professional shortage areas with a population of 1,348,604 residents.”
 Sheldon added that 27.6 percent of physician assistants serve rural areas.
 “PAs, on average, complete more clinical and classroom hours than nurse practitioners,” Sheldon said. “Nurse practitioners in Kentucky, who receive comparable schooling and physician oversight, were granted full prescriptive authority of Schedule II-V drugs including opioids … and have been allowed to prescribe controlled substances since 2006.”
 The regulation includes a temporary licensing, professional standards for prescribing and dispensing controlled substances and professional standards for prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine-mono products or buprenorphine combined with naloxone.
 The controlled substance prescription would still have some regulation.
 According to Sheldon, Schedule II substances are limited to a three-day supply with no refills, Schedule II and II non-narcotic substances are limited to a 30-day supply with no refill and Schedules IV and V are limited to the original prescription and refills are not to exceed a six-month supply.
 Prescriptions for diazepam, clonazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam and carisoprodol are limited to a 30-day supply without any refills, according to Sheldon.
