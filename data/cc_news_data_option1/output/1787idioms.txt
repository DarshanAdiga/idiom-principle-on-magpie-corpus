Australia cricketer Joe Burns feels the enforced break will help players recharge their batteries for when they can finally return to the field. All cricket has been suspended for the time being in the aftermath of coronavirus pandemic that has hit the entire world. Burns calls it a silver lining that players have been forced to stay away from the game for such a long time as according to him it has been one of the longest off-season ever. Definitely this enforced layoff for everyone provides the opportunity just to really get yourself right, reset and start preparing physically for next summer, Burns told reporters through a video conference on Thursday as per news.com.au It s probably the longest off-season any of us would have had for a long time. From a physical perspective it gives the opportunity for us to be in a really strong position. I think that s the silver lining, he added. Burns conceded that there was a time when cricketers were looking for some time off from the game but now, they cannot wait to get out on the middle and play with their teammates. There are times during the year where you do get a little bit worn out, a little bit tired and you do want some time at home. It s the other end of the spectrum now. You can t wait just to get out there on the cricket field and running around with your mates, getting stuck into training and playing games.

“We simply wanted to provide the whole spectrum of possibility and there’s certainly been no suggestion from any supervisor, or anyone, that the county should not provide it,” Taylor said Monday. “In today’s modern world there are certain norms and expectations. It was not a suggestion; it was merely an observation of the state of the law.”
 Taylor said often people expect that if there’s a mandate there are federal or state dollars to help localities pay for those services—and that’s often not the case.
 “It’s still very much on the localities to pay those costs,” Taylor said. “EMS is something that we may do, but it’s obvious from the comments over the last year, I would say, it’s significant to our residents and it’s an expectancy that folks move to communities, even little Greene County, in modern times with expectancy that this service will be available and respond when they call.”
 Greene County Emergency Services Manager Melissa Meador told supervisors April 28 that the county is not building this agency from scratch.
 “There’s a lot of infrastructure in place. There’s been a contingency plan in place for this for quite some time,” Meador said. “The numbers that I ran basically put us at about $1.57 million, and that includes the same level of service that we have now with the UVA contracts. So, that does leave us short of $466,000 that we would have to—for lack of a better term—find somewhere to make this department happen.”
 Meador noted the agency already has an EMS license agreement that would stay in place, as well as an agreement between the Greene County EMS (paid staff) and the Greene County Rescue Squad (volunteers) as far as equipment, the building and supplies.
 “I think we’re in a good position for us to make this move,” Meador said last week. “There are so many advantages to making this move. I wish I had an easy answer to where this remaining funding would come from, but I just wanted to make sure everyone understood that we’re not at zero. We would not be starting from scratch.”
 Board of Supervisors Chair Bill Martin, Stanardsville, said he was encouraged to hear that Meador believed the county could continue the continuity of service once Oct. 14 arrives.
 UVA’s Medic 5 was providing two shifts 24 hours a day, seven days a week after the Greene County Volunteer Rescue Squad told the county last fall they could not continue to cover any shifts.

Advertising revenue decreased 30%, reflecting the comparison to CBS' broadcast of _Super Bowl LIII_ and the NCAA Tournament in the prior year quarter. Taken together, these two events had an unfavorable impact of 34 percentage points on advertising revenue compared to the prior year quarter. This impact was partially offset by higher political advertising sales and the broadcast of an additional NFL playoff game on CBS.

Recently I took the opportunity to watch and listen to a YouTube video in which New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was explaining how he was dealing with the coronavirus and he was responding to criticism from President Donald Trump. I had the inclination to share the video widely. Now, after having read Bert Nye’s letter of appreciation for President Trump’s leadership I wish I had done so.
 Cuomo has obviously put political concerns on the back burner because people are dying and he is struggling and scrambling to stem the tide. This man has done his homework. He speaks without notes, explaining in great detail what he has done and why and what he needs. He takes great care to thank President Trump for the helpful things Mr. Trump has done and begs for more help.
 He holds his temper but does not mince words. President Trump complained that Cuomo and other governors had initially asked for too many beds, which was wasteful. Cuomo made his request based on estimates that came from the executive branch, based on the best knowledge of the time. The President is the chief executive. Cuomo remarked that if President Trump would stop watching so much television and do his job, he might know better what is actually going on. Moreover, instead of blaming Cuomo for following directions that came from Mr. Trump’s own office, he could have proclaimed good news of needing fewer supplies than expected.

“I think that doing an online painting class with mom would be fun,” Hornek said. “It’s a way for adults to have some fun with mom and feel like they are in the room together.”
 Hornek offers online classes at FunArtNight.com and there is a link on the website to order supplies for several painting classes to be shipped to your door.
 Don’t have the time or funds for a painting class?
 “Truth be told, every mama just wants to know that you know how much she loves you,” Hornek said. “Make sure to tell her how much you appreciate her for the lessons she has taught you. Show her how much you love her in a handmade card. Teens can find a YouTube video of how to make a breakfast, lunch or dinner. Surprise her by making her something.”
 Not feeling crafty or don't have the materials? The Greene County Farmers Market is offering online ordering and curbside pickup, so you can support local while picking up fresh baked goodies, handcrafted items and more at greenecommons.com.
 In an effort to help families celebrate, Market Manager Judy Berger has partnered with local vendors to create Mother’s Day recipes based on what will be for sale this week at the market.
 “We don’t really want to encourage kids to come to the farmers market right now, so this will be a job for dad,” Berger said. “Brunch, lunch or dinner ideas, vegetarian and meat lovers’ recipes will be available for shoppers to pick up before they start. These simple recipes will include ingredients from each vendor at the market, and they’ll be family friendly and fun to create for mom.”
 Don’t forget to think about ways to help her relax this Mother’s Day. Maybe it’s just an afternoon to herself to take a bubble bath, go for a walk or takeout from her favorite restaurant. Maybe it’s cleaning the house so she doesn’t have to worry about it and can spend the time reading a book instead. Maybe it’s picking up her favorite bottled beverage or having it delivered so she doesn’t need to make an extra trip to the store.
 “Just be very intentional about listening to the things mom asks you to do over the next couple of days,” advises Hornek. “Keep a list and then on Mother’s Day, make a point to do each one of those things before she has a chance to ask.”
 Whatever you choose to do, make sure it’s something that will help that special mom in your life with some self-care in an otherwise stressful time.

Few plants can rival the spectacular floral displays that are seen in azaleas (Rhododendron). The profusion of flowers, the vivid colors that are available, and their adaptability to different soil and climates makes them one of the most popular shrubs that we grow. It would not be springtime without azaleas, and this is especially true in the Southeast.      Most well-established neighborhoods with their large trees are the ideal cover for these lovely plants, giving them the dappled shade they need and the leaf litter and pine needles that azaleas appreciate. They have been bred for hundreds of years and there are more than 10,000 different cultivars of these lovely plants. Although most people associate azaleas with spring, some bloom in summer and fall. By carefully selecting plants, you can have azaleas blooming at least eight months of the year.      To keep these plants looking pretty and blooming their heads off, one needs to do some general maintenance after they bloom, and timing is critical if you want your azaleas to bloom next year. The best time to prune is within three to four weeks after they finish blooming in the spring. Azaleas, like other plants, need time to make the flower buds for the next year. If you wait too late to prune, you will be cutting off the flower buds for the following spring and instead of having a lovely flowering plant, you will have a green bush with few flowers, if any at all.      There are two classes of azaleas, our native azaleas and the Asian azaleas. Native azaleas are indigenous to many parts of the U.S. and they are growing in popularity. They are sometimes called wild or honeysuckle azaleas and many have a lovely fragrance. These azaleas typically do not need to be pruned because they have a more open shape. However, if you do want to prune them, it is very important to prune at the right time so that you do not miss out on flowers the following year.      On the other hand, the Asian azaleas are the evergreen ones with most of them coming from Japan. Azaleas bloom on old wood. They produce flower buds on last year's growth and for this reason, it is very important to prune immediately after they finish blooming. If you prune in summer or fall, you will be removing the flower buds. The new reblooming azaleas like Encore and Bloom-A- Thon bloom on both last year's growth and the current year's growth. They also need to be pruned in the spring, like the other evergreen azaleas.      When preparing to prune, you need a pair of hand clippers and a pair of loppers. Hand clippers work well on the smaller branches and use the loppers on branches one-half to 1 1/2 inches thick. The long handles of the loppers give you the leverage for cutting larger limbs and allows you to get inside the bush to prune.      I would not use hedge trimmers or shears on azaleas unless you want a formal look or a shaped hedge. If you do this year after year, you will still need to go deep inside from time to time and prune. If you only use hedge trimmers, over time, you will have only growth on the very top of the bush and the plants could become leggy.      In most landscapes, azaleas look best when they are pruned a little each year to let light and air get into the bush yet keep the graceful shape of the bush. This is done by going inside the bush and pruning. I have a rule that I never prune more than one-fourth to one-third of a bush in any given year. You can come back next year and prune again so the bush keeps a lovely shape.      However, if major pruning is needed, and you want to take out more than one- third of the bush, it is best to do this in the late winter. This is only needed when a bush has become overgrown and you want to make it smaller in size. You can cut a bush down to about 18 inches in height but this dramatic pruning must be done in winter when the sap is down. Of course, you will be losing blooms that spring but this way, you will save the bush and it will come back and you can work to keep it under control. I find that larger azaleas, like the Southern Indica azaleas, are the ones that need this pruning if left unpruned year after year.      People are often scared to prune and I can understand this fear. I use to be the same way. What I find is a good solution is to prune some and then go back a few days later and see what you think. You can always cut more if the shrub is still too large. Just remember not to cut more than a quarter to a third of a bush when doing spring pruning.      Recently, I pruned one bed and it looked thin in some places. Looking at that bed several days later, branches were starting to fill in where I had cut and it looked much better. Branches that were squashed had moved over to fill the holes. It makes me think that I need to go prune some more. Plants are forgiving too and they will put out new growth and hide your mistakes.

Wright’s own children have had birthdays recently, and it has brought to light how much “running around” is usually part of planning birthdays and other celebrations.
 “All those errands feel much more stressful if not fully impossible right now,” she said. “When things can be simple and achievable, that’s ideal.”
 While Wright could not comment on whether they have seen an uptick in service requests at the counseling center right now, she has definitely seen people—moms included—who are struggling.
 “I can say that everyone I have spoken to, whether newly seeking services or an existing client, is sharing concerns or impacts related to the overall (COVID-19) situation,” she said. “I think the need for services related to this will continue to come in waves, likely for a very long time.”
 So, what kind of simple ideas come to mind?
 If you or your kids are able to cook or bake for mom, treat her to a home- cooked meal or breakfast in bed. Just make sure she doesn’t end up being the one to clean up the mess in the kitchen. For those who don’t live with their mom, see what restaurants in her area are offering delivery and consider sending her a nice meal to show you care.
 Feeling crafty? Local art teacher Tammy Hornek has some suggestions for easy crafts people can create at home for mom without needing to spend a lot of money on new materials.

After my kids left the nest, I went from cooking every night for four people to cooking every night for just my husband and myself. And when I say cooking every night, I actually mean, eating out twice a week, ordering in three times a week, and cooking twice. Actually, I'd cook only once, because the second time we'd have leftovers.      But then we all got quarantined and suddenly I was making three meals a day every day for the two of us for what felt like a year. My husband of course, didn't see anything wrong with this, while I felt like I'd become a short- order cook.      So, when my husband asked me a simple question for the ninety-fifth hundredth time, I kind of lost my mind.      "Hey honey, what's for dinner?" he said.      "Aauugghh!" I yelled and ran into the bathroom. I needed to be alone with my thoughts. There weren't many. It was mostly that I didn't want to make dinner again.      The problem wasn't so much that I had to cook. The problem was what I had to cook with. While other people had bought rolls and rolls of toilet paper for the quarantine, I had stocked up on beans. Apparently, for no reason whatsoever, I was convinced that a pandemic would lead to a shortage of beans, so I panicked and bought a dozen or so cans. But in my bean-induced confusion, I hit the wrong button and instead of ordering a few cans, I ordered a case, and when it arrived, I was the proud owner of 50 cans of beans.      Beside having nowhere to store 50 cans of beans, I had another problem. When I was ordering my beans, I failed to take into account the fact that my family has not historically done too well with beans, and there existed the very real possibility that if I served too many meals made of beans, we would probably, in no uncertain terms, blow up.      This was not something I was guessing at. This was a known fact. Having made chili before, I knew what effects the beans had on my family, and let's just say that there isn't enough Febreeze in the world to overcome what my family let loose. There was a time, once, where I was pretty sure we were to blame for a massive hole in the Earth's ozone that had formed after we had dinner on Chili night.      Then, that weekend, we took our leftovers with us when we went skiing. The next day, I swear we all skied 50% faster because of our "tailwind."      The kids, naturally, found all this hilarious. My husband and I … not so much. At some point, I tried giving everyone some of those natural digestive enzymes they sell in the store for just such a problem. It was clear they didn't help when the gas company showed up at our door after the neighbors reported smelling something noxious coming from our house.      Knowing that the beans posed a serious threat to our comfort, and quite possibly my marriage, I needed to find a way to cook them so neither of us would have a problem. I scoured the internet and discovered that soaking and rinsing the beans prior to cooking, even canned beans, would help a lot.      So, one night I tested the theory and made a batch of Black Bean Sloppy Joes. The rinsing seemed to do the trick for me and I felt no gaseous side effects after dinner. But as we sat on the couch later, I suddenly smelled something so bad it singed my nose hairs.      "Was that you?" I asked my husband as I smothered my face with a pillow.      "No," he said, pulling his shirt up over his nose. "You?"      I shook my head. We both looked down at the dog asleep on the floor.   "Hmmm," I said. "Guess I won't be putting any more beans in his food."   You can follow Tracy on Twitter @TracyBeckerman and become a fan on Facebook at www.facebook.com/LostinSuburbiaFanPage.
