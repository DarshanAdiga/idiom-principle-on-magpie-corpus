‚ÄúHe‚Äôll definitely be a problem for us,‚Äù Belichick said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not one thing you can take away from him. He does a lot things, does a lot of things well.‚Äù
 The Raiders do a good job moving Waller around, making it more difficult for opponents to game plan against him. In last week‚Äôs game against the Saints, he caught passes from a traditional tight end spot, the slot, out wide and from the backfield. He has been targeted on 38.7% of Raiders passes, the highest mark in the league.
 It also helps that the Raiders have more talent around him this year with speedy rookie receiver Henry Ruggs III attracting plenty of attention, as well as a strong running game led by Josh Jacobs.
 ‚ÄúOur offensive balance right now is amazing,‚Äù Waller said. ‚ÄúWe could see it coming from training camp and once we first got together as a team and actually started doing something, you could tell that there is a lot of guys that deserve to have opportunities to get the rock because they‚Äôre going to make things happen. ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just thankful that I can be part of that group, part of that balance that they can count on to make plays whenever I‚Äôm called upon. Whatever the numbers look like, that‚Äôs cool with me.‚Äù
 Waller‚Äôs journey has been an inspiring one. After nearly squandering his career in Baltimore because of a drug addiction, he has now developed into one of the most dependable pieces on the Raiders.
 Waller was suspended four games in 2016 and all of 2017 because of drug violations. He spent most of 2018 on the Ravens practice squad before the Raiders plucked him away late that season.

PITTSBURGH (AP) ‚Äî Randy Fichtner watched the big kid with the strong arm and the sense of invincibility that is the province of the very young and immediately grew worried.
 So Fichter, then the Pittsburgh Steelers' quarterbacks coach, suggested to Ben Roethlisberger that he might want to think about getting rid of the ball a little sooner. Push the tempo a little faster. Don't take so many risks. Absorb fewer hits.
 In other words, play it safe.
 ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll never forget, he looked at me and says, ‚ÄòRandy, then I wouldn‚Äôt be me,'" Fichtner, now Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator, said Thursday. "And from that moment, I knew that there‚Äôs a reason why he‚Äôs been Big Ben.‚Äù
 Improbably, all these years later, Roethlisberger is still here. Still playing. Still throwing. Still performing. And while he's learned a thing or two about discretion during his 17 seasons in the league, the 20-something who seemed to welcome the punishment he received on a weekly basis has become the 38-year-old poised to set a mark that's a testament to his durability and his adaptability.
 When Roethlisberger runs onto the Heinz Field turf Sunday to lead Pittsburgh (2-0) against Houston (0-2), it will be his 221st game in the NFL. No Steelers player ‚Äî not Terry Bradshaw or Joe Greene or Mel Blount or Jerome Bettis or all the rest ‚Äî has played more games in black-and-gold. Maybe it's fitting that when he takes his first snap, he'll break a tie with Hall of Fame center Mike Webster for the most appearances in franchise history.
 Roethlisberger credits his unexpected longevity on his faith and the fact he plays for one of the most stable teams in professional sports. Oh, and being built like a tight end more than a quarterback helps.

FRANKFORT, Ky. (WAVE) - Governor Andy Beshear is making it clear he supports Mayor Greg Fischer‚Äôs implementation of a 9 p.m. curfew in Louisville. Fischer set the 72-hour curfew Wednesday as demonstrators take to the streets in protest of Attorney General Daniel Cameron‚Äôs findings in the Breonna Taylor death investigation.‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs necessary. I know people might not like it,‚Äù Beshear said during his daily media briefing in Frankfort.The governor then stressed his support of the First Amendment and the right to peaceful demonstrations. However, he said oftentimes there are outsiders who take advantage of situations and create chaos where it isn‚Äôt needed. ‚ÄúThere are always individuals who might want to turn something peaceful into something it‚Äôs not,‚Äù Beshear said.Kentucky National Guard members and Kentucky State Police troopers were called into the city Wednesday to support Louisville Metro Police officers in keeping demonstrators from blocking public streets, enforcing the curfew, and preventing any possible riots or violence. When protests in downtown Louisville got destructive in late May, Fischer also instructed the governor to send in the National Guard and KSP, to quote ‚Äúhelp keep the peace.‚ÄùBeshear said there isn‚Äôt a timeline for how long the extra forces will be in Louisville.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that we look at on a day-to-day basis," he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to keep them there any longer than is absolutely necessary."Major Aubrey Gregory (left) and officer Robinson Desrouches (right)The governor explained that after two LMPD officers were shot while conducting crowd control in Louisville Wednesday night, he is happy KSP troopers and National Guard members were in the city as backup law enforcement. He also stressed how ‚Äúabsolutely wrong‚Äù the shooting was and said he spoke to the officers' families.‚ÄúI want to condemn this act of violence in the most dark terms," Beshear said grimly. "It is absolutely wrong. The answer to violence can never be violence.‚ÄùThe two officers, Major Aubrey Gregory and Officer Robinson Desroches, are both expected to make full recoveries. Larynzo D. Johnson, 26, of Louisville, was arrested for the shooting and is charged with two counts of assault on a police officer and 14 counts of wanton endangerment of a police officer.During the unrest, WAVE 3 News reporter Kaitlin Rust and photographer James Dobson had to be escorted away and shielded by a security guard in Jefferson Square Park after being confronted by aggressive demonstrators.(Story continues below video)WAVE 3 News reporter Kaitlin Rust and photographer James Dobson had to be escorted away and guarded by security in Jefferson Square Park.In total, at least 127 people were taken into custody related to protests in the city Wednesday.Beshear addressed briefly a call he took with President Donald Trump, saying the president offered ‚Äúadditional assistance‚Äù in Louisville if it was needed.‚ÄúThe president and I agreed that right now we had sufficient assets and didn‚Äôt need that help," Beshear explained. ‚ÄúIt was a positive conversation about what was already in place."The governor revealed President Trump initiated the phone call and said he was pleased with their conversation.Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News.

 ‚ÄúA district attorney decides who to prosecute,‚Äù one dancer says. Followed by another who asks, ‚ÄúDo you know who elects the DA?

If you have a positive outlook on things, your kids will too. These exchange students don‚Äôt stay strangers for long, they will end up being a part of your family. My exchange students don‚Äôt feel cheated (on their exchange year) even with a strange end to their year but they feel like they got to experience American culture still in our home. There will never be the ‚Äúright‚Äù time to host but it can always be a GOOD time to host, you just have to be ready to take the leap.‚Äù

 Giants coach Joe Judge has had his team work on the field since training camp opened in late July. None of his players complained about it, he said.
 What Giants fans have to complain about is the team's anemic offense, which will be without running back Saquon Barkley (knee) for the rest of the season. Wide receiver Sterling Shepard (toe) is out for at least three games.
 New York is averaging 14.5 points and turned the ball over four times, with quarterback Daniel Jones throwing three interceptions and losing a fumble. The offensive line has struggled and the running game is last in the league.
 The defense has been surprisingly good, allowing 43 points, only 10 in the second half.
 It has left Judge looking for his first win, which is par for the course. The Giants have started 0-2 every year since 2013, with the exception being in 2016, the only year they made the playoffs.

There's also some hard-to-comprehend pseudoscience talk of the future about chips versus virtual reality gear, and some philosophical claptrap emanating from the mouth of a virtual woman who suddenly appears "in the flesh."
 Toward the end, Moshe tosses in some double crossing, a monologue from "Hamlet" (along with a reference to Shakespeare's real-life pal Richard Burbage), and an interesting concept called "virtual assassination."
 "LX 2048" is an odd little movie, but it's got something going for it. So many films tend to run out of steam before their conclusion. In this one, things really pick up near the end.

Well, something that is good needs continuity. You can see the handiwork of the governor all over the place. Akure for nstance has become a construction site. I can name several hitherto umpassable roads that are now dualissed roads. In other senatorial districts, a lot of roads are being constructed. Today, the governor was in Okitipupa to commission projects that were abandoned by the past administration. One of such is the Senate building at the Agagu University. The university came to being during the Agagu regime, but throughout the eight years regime of the past governor, no single addition was made. Governor Akeredolu said he was not going to abandon any project, so he committed human and material resources towards their completion. And today, people are happy with the quantum of projects they see around them. Another major project undertaken by the governor is the Redemption Bridge on Ore Road. Before it was constructed, a lot of carnage happened at that junction. Most people that died in the accidents were Ondo citizens and the governor was not happy. Hence the resolve to find a solution. And since the bridge was constructed by the governor, many lives have been saved. The president was here to commission the project. Again, in the area of job creation, the governor has done tremendously well. The truth of the matter is that not everybody can be incorporated into the civil service. So what most governors who mean business do now is to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive. We have what we call the industry hub in Ore. Also, the Ondo Lane Industrial hub. That place has about four industries now and 70% of the workforce are people from Ondo State. In the sector where they produce ethanol, that section alone has made a lot of people to go into cassava planting because they know there is already a market for their products. We have a textile industry and a vehicle assembly plant there. So, these are the kinds of projects that we know that the governor will continue to work on when he gets another term in office. But the most important project to us, which I know is also very dear to the governor, is the Ondo Ports project. Just like the Apapa Port in Lagos. Ondo State has the longest shoreline in Nigeria among the coastal states. And we want to take advantage of this and leverage on the economic benefits. Any moment from now, we will get everything that is necessary legitimately to start the port. And once we have that port, Ondo State will turn 360 in terms of economic development. Though the project has started, it is one of those the governor is hoping to complete in his second term. It was conceived as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) project and it is going to be huge These are the things we want to build on during the second term. Road projects will continue, construction and renovation of schools will continue, and welfare of workers will be paramount.

It is always like this every four years in the build up to a governorship election. It is one of the most important elections to any politician in a state. Unlike the presidential election which people see as herculean and not easily achievable, the governorship election is local. In this clime, people see the governor as their own president. And so it is always stiff and competitive. So, every four years, the people go to the poll to elect their governor. All the major political parties are done with their primaries and are setting up campaign structures, trying to sell their candidates to the electorates. I want to say that my own party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has concluded its primary. And the incumbent, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu, is the flagbearer of our party. And by the grace of God, all things been equal, he will be victorious at the polls on the 10th of October 2020. I am not just saying this because I am a member of the APC, but because of the monumental infrastructural development the governor had put in place the state which in turn have endeared the people, even his critics to him. At the onset of this adminilstration, we inherited over seven months of unpaid salaries. The wage bill of Ondo State is around N3.5billion. And we offset 7months of unpaid salaries. You can do the arithmetics by yourself. We are presently not owing our workers salaries as the governor recently cleared all arrears, deductions, and leave bonuses of two or three years owed workers. It took that long because the governor was busy battling with backlog of inherited salaries. The civil servants are now happy. The governor was able to achieve this in spite of the economic situation of the country. You know Nigeria recently came out of a recession and proceeds from oil revenue have continued to fall. It took the ingenuiness of the governor to be able to raise funds to do these wonders. Before the government of Akeredolu came in, the IGR of the state was around N400m to N600million monthly. As at today, we are hovering between N1.5billion and N1.8billion. That is over 100 percent increment. And that was why we were able to cushion the effect of the shortage in federal allocation. Then again, one important thing that is obvious when you enter Ondo State is the state of our public primary schools. Before now, most of the primary schools were dilapidated and unsuitable for learning. Enrollment dropped because parents were withdrawing their wards from public to private schools. But when Arakunrin came on board, particularly in 2017, he transformed the schools withing a short period. I am a living witness because I was once an education secretary. He was able to raise the counterpart funding required to access the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) funds for the development of the schools, which the state could not access in over four years. With the released funds, he embarked on massive construction projects and in the spate of three years, primary schools in Ondo State beca.e the toast and envy of other states. This has led to more enrollment in public schools because parents now know that what they will get in private schools, they will get better in our public schools. It is not only the structures that the government added value to. I can mention the school feeding initiative, schools were equipped with computers, and teachers were given more trainings. Also, we have never had it so good in agriculture. At the onset of every farming season, the government made provisions for farm imputs - seedlings, fertilizers, chemicals and many others. This has encouraged a lot of people to go into farming. For example, I have started farming. Because when you looked at it, the price of oil has crashed in the international market and people need other sources of income. Agriculture is the way to go if any country wants to be sufficient in terms of food, as food security is very important. In a few weeks, we are going to go for election. We are prepared for it and by the grace of God, our party will come out victorious.

 The state audit found that UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara had admitted at least 64 applicants during the six-year time period in question because of connections to donors, campus staff or alumni. In most of the cases, the audit found, the admitted students had been rated not competitive for admission. The majority of them were white and at least half had annual family incomes of $150,000 or more.
 UC Berkeley was the worst offender, the audit said, with 55 cases of inappropriate admissions. Among them, 14 cases involved students who were denied admission through the regular process and were offered a spot on the waitlist.

Having access to a full kitchen was nice for two reasons. First, we quickly realized that food was not cheap in Aspen, and it provided us the option to heat up leftovers.
 We also liked that we could buy food from the grocery store and cook meals ourselves, which was especially relevant for guests who may not feel comfortable eating at restaurants just yet. The room came fully stocked with all the cooking essentials like pots, plates, and silverware.
 Since I am an avid tea drinker, the tea kettle, along with a paper bag full of tea, coffee, and condiments was the icing on the cake. I usually travel with loose teas but forgot to pack mine. Luckily, the housekeeping staff refreshed our coffee and tea on a daily basis. However, in keeping with updated protocols, the staff was careful to only come in the room when we were out.
 After living in New York City for years and having to truck my dirty clothes several blocks away to the laundromat, The Gant's stacked laundry unit in the room was perhaps my favorite amenity. There were two complimentary Tide pods provided, so I even washed items that barely needed it so I wouldn't have any laundry to do when I got back home.
 I enjoyed a good night's sleep on the bed, which was medium firmness with a warm comforter and there was also an extra blanket in the closet in case I got chilly from the AC.
 Our two-bedroom condo was just right for our purposes, though families or groups may want to take full advantage of the three- and four-bedroom options, which start at $370. Similarly, couples and solo travelers who still want access to a kitchen and a separate sitting area would have more than enough space in a one-bedroom, which can come in at $199 in slower seasons and offer a serious deal when compared with many other hotel options in the area.
 The Standard was one of three levels of interiors we could have booked, followed by Deluxe or Premier condominiums. Those looking for chicer, high-end finishings may want to consider the recently renovated Premiere Condos and Deluxe Condos. The newer rooms are professionally decorated and include nicer touches like new appliances, stone fireplaces, marble countertops, and more modern decor. That said, beyond being newer, they don't offer much else in terms of additional space or amenities and start at $280 for a one-bedroom. While a little more dated, I found my Standard Condo to be more than sufficient and the better value.
 However, keep in mind that the best savings are found in the summer and fall low season. Once the winter ski season gets into full swing, the starting price of a room like ours quickly surges to $529. That said, in Aspen, it's not uncommon for popular ritzy resort rooms to go for upwards of $1,000 per night, so, The Gant still offers a strong value despite the higher winter price tag.

Marseille made a historic move into the music industry on Thursday after the announcement that the French Ligue 1 club had launched a rap record label alongside music industry titan BMG.
 In a statement, BMG said that OM Records was "a new label for hip-hop, rap, and R&B;" and is to be based in the southern French city, which has long been one of the country's major hip-hop hubs.
 To celebrate the new label a jet black double decker bus with some of the city's local rap stars and DJs on board, played music around France's second- largest city.
 "It's good that the club is doing this," said rapper Hollis l'Infame, a lifelong Marseille fan who wears the team's white shirt in his videos.
 "I think I was a Marseille fan even before I was born, it's in our genes."
 Head of A&R; Emilie Hauck told AFP that OM Records is a "50-50 joint venture" between the club and BMG and "the first time ever that a record industry major and a club like OM have come together to create a label".
 Marseille president Jacques-Henri Eyraud said: "Marseille has been a cradle of French rap and hip-hop since the IAM collective and the links between OM and local artists have been strong for years."
 IAM have been one of France's most important rap groups since the late 1980s and have long collaborated with iconic American group Wu-Tang Clan.
 "The launch of OM Records strengthens this link and symbolises the club's desire to promote the unique energy that emanates from Marseille and its people all over the world," added Eyraud.
 The new label will offer opportunities for artists and groups from "Marseille, the South of France and Africa", said BMG's General Manager for France Sylvain Gazaignes.
 The first album to be released on OM Records will a compilation called 'Vendredi 13' ('Friday the 13th') and will be produced by the four people behind the B18 label created in the tough northern districts of Marseille a year ago.

TECUMSEH -- When the Adrian and Tecumseh boys soccer teams left Tecumseh's home soccer pitch after Tecumseh's 5-1 win Tuesday night, although it didn't feel much like it, the two teams both had reached the halfway point of their respective seasons.
   
 In a normal year, that wouldn't be extremely remarkable to make it to the halfway point.
   
 But as everyone is aware, 2020 has not been a normal year, and the soccer players were one of a group of student-athletes who had their fall seasons thrown into chaos.
   
 Summer practices were interrupted and then once practices were restarted on Aug. 12, it took almost a month beyond that date before the MHSAA and state authorities gave the green light for soccer to get underway, so to get to the halfway point in a chaotic fall where all the players are dealing with new schedules and restrictions, is something to be recognized.
   
 "It's hard," said Tecumseh coach Jerry Nowak. "The guys are adapting to it pretty well. We try to stay pretty rigid with the guys in practice so they get acclimated to it well. It's one of those things. In a game, a referee makes a bad call, you can lament the call and you can get so wrapped up in the call that you stop playing well, it's the same thing with the masks. If we're going to have to lament wearing a mask, we're going to lose focus in the game, and the guys have just decided that we're going to play. If we have to wear a mask, we'll wear a mask, but we're going to beat you."
   
 For Adrian (0-5-1) and Tecumseh (3-1-2), the big thing became about minimizing the strain on their players, as the Southeastern Conference made up an aggressive schedule for its teams. Both Nowak and Adrian coach Ted Hanosh have had to balance fitness and recovery for their players, who have had to adjust to new conditions at school, but also a condensed schedule and having to wear a mask to practice and play games.
   
 "Everybody is in the same boat, so I think it's gonna be that everybody stays healthy," Hanosh said. "My concern is that our kids going back-to-back, and they could be in great shape, but ask them to go 80 minutes and then another 80 minutes that next time, it's tough on the body.
   
 "We had three games and one back-to-back, and they were all home last week, which was nice. Imagine three road games and I want to make sure they stay eligible. We ask kids to get on a bus and ride away three nights during the week, it gets tough. So healthy and eligible, all those outlying things that we've got to make sure stay in there for that tournament push. Last time we tied Tecumseh, this time they got the better of us here, they tied Dexter. A lot of things could happen down the road with these kids, and you never know who's going to be able to stay on the field."
   
 For Nowak, it also meant going to a more defensive look for his team this year than had been used in years past, but balancing that with keeping the team's quick-strike capability on offense, and cutting back on practices with his team playing around 240 minutes per week.
   
 "The scoring is a little bit tougher, and so we have to put more of a premium on keeping the ball out of our net, but we don't want to play what is called 'parking the bus' and everybody is playing back (in our own half)" Nowak said. "What we're basically doing is playing a tight triangle with our center mids and we're clogging up the center of the field and making teams play to to the outside. If they can play the ball to the outside and cross it in, if they can beat my two center backs, then they beat us. I'll take that gamble every day of the week.
   
 "Our players bought into it and they understand it. These games are close and they understand. These guys have to know that they can have a terrific playoff run and can still finish first in the league because we get Dexter and Chelsea one more time."

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe the polls,‚Äù one longtime GOP activist told me last week. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be just like four years ago.‚Äù
 Trump voters have no doubt that they are again being underappreciated in the media and underrepresented in surveys. But another reason is their confidence that every last Trump supporter in America will vote, come hell, high water or COVID-19.
 Among the easiest jobs in the political world must be serving as Get-Out-the- Vote (GOTV) director for the Trump campaign. In most cases, GOTV directors ‚Äî be they Republican or Democrat ‚Äî spend fitful days and nights devising sophisticated ways to drive every last sympathetic voter to the polls. Trump voters need no artificial stimulation.
 Take the recent ‚Äúrolling rallies,‚Äù impressive collections of Trump voters taking to the nation‚Äôs highways to fly their flags for the president. The events are publicized mostly on social media and by word of mouth.
 This month, more than 6,000 people signed up to participate in a motorcade celebrating Trump that circled Cincinnati‚Äôs I-275 beltway for as far as the eye could see. Rally participant Judie Howard explained her dedication in terms of what she owed Trump.
 ‚ÄúHe was chosen by God for us,‚Äù she said, adding that riding in the rally is ‚Äúthe least we can do.‚Äù Similar rallies have been held across the nation. It‚Äôs hard to imagine Biden inspiring comparable levels of grass-roots enthusiasm.
 But while passion is important ‚Äî and Trump‚Äôs supporters are arguably more zealous than those of any candidate in modern history ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt guarantee that when the votes are tabulated, the president‚Äôs legions won‚Äôt be outnumbered by a combination of Democrats, Never-Trump Republicans and independents who desperately want anyone but Trump in the Oval Office.
 While Biden doesn‚Äôt personally generate much passion, he will benefit from Trump haters everywhere, who collectively are a fervent lot.
 For Trump voters, though, a Biden victory is inconceivable. Trump is the only plain talker preventing political correctness from overwhelming their lives; the bulwark against old-fashioned, flag-saluting patriotism vanishing into history; the firewall against Big Brother imposing overly restrictive mandates on healthy Americans in the name of safety and security.
 In short, Trump is the only thing standing between them and a bleak future of entrenched, irreversible, institutional b.s. It‚Äôs all the motivation they need.

The way to know if the vaccine is going to work is by giving it to a test group. Researchers then wait to see how many contract COVID-19. They are testing large groups because there is no way of knowing where the virus will circulate and they also need to get valid results fast. A large trial hopes to overcome both of these challenges. The idea is to develop a vaccine that is both safe and effective. As long as it is safe, even a 50% effectiveness will help mitigate the virus.

Besides leaving the charging brick out of the boxes containing the new iPhone 12 series handsets, Apple will also reportedly stop including the wired EarBuds in the iPhone packaging. We imagine that Apple will give consumers the opportunity to add the EarBuds and the charger to online orders (at an extra cost, of course). The EarBuds with a Lightning connector is priced at $29 from the App Store. The iPhone 12 series is rumored to support 20W fast charging and the brick will probably be priced at $29.  
   
 Last year, for the very first time, Apple included an 18W fast charger in the box with the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Starting with the iPhone 8 line in 2017 and including the 2018 models, the iOS-powered handsets supported 18W charging although a 5W brick was found in the box. Those who wanted to take advantage of the faster-charging speeds that allow users to charge to 50% in 30 minutes, had to shell out $29 for the 18W accessory. That is, until last year." This year will be even worse with the absence of both the EarBuds and the charging brick. Even with the nice looking braided cable, be prepared to open your wallet even after you spring to buy one of the new 5G iPhone 12 models.

There are times when a new custom home, however tempting it may sound, is not the right choice for right now. It may be a desire to stay within the same neighborhood or school district, it could be that most of the house fits the family perfectly but there is just one part of it that could suit the dynamics of the household better. For a family that likes to entertain, that could mean opening up the floor plan so a group can gather around the kitchen area and family room with open sightlines. It could be a growing family that doesn't want to dine together in a formal dining room but a large central island in the kitchen would be the perfect space to spend quality time together. Whatever the reason, Davis Group brings its expertise in building luxury custom homes and their innovative design perspective to every unique space. They are able to 'think out of the box' and then plan a project which can take a house that almost works into the home which is simply perfect. Houston bathroom remodeling projects and kitchen remodeling projects are the most popular, although any space within the house can be re-imagined. From modern Mediterranean to English Tudor, from a French provincial influence to a sophisticated Santa Barbara vibe, the Davis Group website holds a portfolio of inspiration to make the most of luxury living in Houston.

This was a three-month extension of an original dividend ban imposed by the regulator earlier in the year, designed to help banks absorb losses and support lending throughout the coronavirus crisis.

Laura Stutzman had no doubts that this year‚Äôs Twin Falls County Fair should go on despite the pandemic still raging across the U.S. ‚Äî and several outbreaks tied to such community fairs.
 Though she saw few people wearing masks from her volunteer station in the fair‚Äôs hospitality tent in southern Idaho earlier this month, she said she wasn‚Äôt concerned. Stutzman, 63, had been attending the fair off and on for 30 years, and she didn‚Äôt consider this year that different. People in rural communities know how to respect one another‚Äôs space, she said, and don‚Äôt have time to ‚Äúfret and worry‚Äù about the coronavirus.
 ‚ÄúCommon sense is knowing that COVID-19 is in the picture,‚Äù she said, yet not allowing fear to ‚Äúdictate how we live.‚Äù
 Hundreds of state and county fairs typically take place across the U.S. each year. They are a centerpiece for the agricultural industry ‚Äî particularly for the 4-H kids who raise livestock all year to show off at their local events. Thousands of people are drawn to small towns for the concerts, rodeos, races and carnivals that flesh out the experience.
 But only about one in five fairs took place as scheduled this summer, while the rest were dramatically modified or outright canceled because of the pandemic, according to data provided by the International Association of Fairs & Expositions.
 Fairs are the economic lifeblood and cultural high point of the year for many rural communities, so the decision to cancel one is especially consequential. Scaling back can have devastating effects on the finances of the fair organizers and local community. And organizers fear that skipping a single year could mean losing a fair permanently.

This might be an extreme comparison based off of some big playoff games in the bubble, but I think Herro has the chance to be the three-level scorer and playmaker that Brandon Roy was.
 In Herro's first playoffs, he's averaging 16.5 points, 5.7 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game on 44.8% shooting from the field and 37.8% from 3. In Roy's rookie season where he was named Rookie of the Year, he averaged 16.8 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.0 assists on 45.6% shooting from the field and 37.7% from 3.
 The two stat lines are comparable, except Herro's doing it while playing a key role in helping the Heat reach the Eastern Conference Finals and potentially the NBA Finals.
 Roy's ceiling was limitless prior to his knee injuries. He was explosive off the dribble, worked well in pick-and-rolls and was relentless in attacking the basket with some sneaky athleticism to him. He could shoot off the dribble, create his own shot, pull-up from 3 or midrange, or work as a spot-up shooter.
 Sound familiar? Herro is flashing a lot of those same skills as a versatile offensive threat. While he might not get to the rim the way that Roy did, I think he actually has the potential to be a better passer and rebounder than Roy was.
 Even with Roy's injuries, he still tallied three All-Star nominations and two All-NBA nods. If Herro continues to improve the way I'd expect him to in this perfect role in Miami, it wouldn't shock me if he becomes an All-Star and All- NBA calibre player.
 Again, I know it's a lot off of a handful of strong playoff series, but it's well-deserved with the way this 20 year old is playing like a five-year veteran already.

James Tavernier slotted home his 50th Rangers goal after being restored to penalty duties in a rampant 4-0 Europa League win for the Light Blues over Willem II in Holland.
 The Gers skipper was taken off spot-kicks by boss Steven Gerrard last season after failing to convert for the third time in five attempts.
 But the Englishman brought up his half-century after stepping back up to slot home the opener against the Dutchmen.
 Ryan Kent ‚Äì who was brought down for the penalty ‚Äì then prodded home the second before teeing up Filip Helander.
 Connor Goldson put the seal on a crushing victory at the Koning Willem II Stadion as Gerrard‚Äôs team steamrollered their way through to the play-offs.
 Ianis Hagi will now face his father Gheorghe‚Äôs old side Galatasaray when they visit Ibrox next Thursday.
 Rangers were rudely awakened in the early hours of the morning when Dutch fans let off a firework display outside their hotel.
 But it was Gers who exploded into life as two goals in the space of three first-half minutes lit the fuse to victory.
 Williem II had chances to defuse Gers‚Äô hopes of progression but Adrie Koster‚Äôs Eredivisie outfit misfired twice early.
 Allan McGregor was recalled to start ahead of Jon McLaughlin but there was some rustiness from the 38-year-old as he spilled Mike Tresor‚Äôs strike at Vangelis Pavlidis‚Äô feet.
 The Greece international could only crash the rebound off the bar and there was another let-off as he fired over again moments later when Tresor turned provider with a cut-back.
 Rangers had not exactly dominated the early exchanges but Willem II made the crucial mistake of standing off Steven Davis after 22 minutes and the Northern Ireland skipper made them pay with a sublime ball over the top for Kent.
 Miquel Nelom made it an easy call for Italian referee Maurizio Mariani as he sent the ¬£7million man tumbling with a clip of the heels.
 Tavernier had not been trusted to take a penalty since failing to convert in a 2-1 win over Motherwell last October.
 But he shook off any lingering spot-kick doubt as he fired down the middle for his fourth goal in five games.
 Before the hosts could gather their senses, they were two down as Gers struck again.
 Robbin Ruiter should have held a tame Alfredo Morelos strike but let the ball squirm loose and Kent was there in a flash to bundle home again.
 McGregor did better 10 minutes before the break as produced an incredible block to deny former Ajax youngster Che Nunnely after his quick exchange with Pavlidis took Helander out of the equation.
 He had to be on his toes as Gorkem Saglam flashed in a strike just as the second half got underway.
 And Rangers were out of sight by the 55th minute as Helander nodded home the third.
 Willem II thought the danger was over as they cleared a Tavernier free-kick but Kent continued to be the Light Blues‚Äô tormentor-in-chief as he swung over a perfect ball for the big Swede to thud past Ruiter.
 Goldson was not to be outdone by his centre-back partner and added a fourth on 71 minutes as he glanced home from Tavernier‚Äôs out-swinging corner.
 Pavlidis had the ball in the Gers net with 10 minutes left but rightly copped a booking after using an arm to finally beat McGregor following another breathtaking save from the keeper.

 The camera is designed to follow a path that the owner sets by carrying it around the house. The camera has a battery life of approximately five minutes, and it's designed to make short trips of about one minute each.
 The device is only capable of recording while in flight, according to Ring. When it's not zipping around the house, the Always Home Cam sits in its dock where the camera is blocked. The flying camera will also make a sound when it flight to alert that it's recording.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) ‚Äî The San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants are battling the injury bug after just two games, as well some other scary issues.
 Wondering what might scare NFL players?
 For the Niners (1-1), it's just being back at MetLife Stadium on Sunday to face the winless Giants (0-2).
 It's not the Giants they find scary. New York is enduring yet another bad start and facing the prospect of missing the playoffs for the eighth time in nine years.
 San Francisco's concern is the stadium and it's new artificial surface. In a 31-13 win over the Jets last weekend, the 49ers saw four key players, including NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Nick Bosa, leave with knee injuries.
 The Niners complained to the league about the ‚Äústicky‚Äù surface and now they have to play on it again. Bosa, fellow lineman Solomon Thomas and halfbacks Raheem Mostert and Tevin Coleman are out. Quarterback Jimmy Garappolo (ankle) is doubtful, so Nick Mullens is expected to start.
 San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan says he has put the field issue to rest, and told his players to focus on the game. The league inspected the field Wednesday and said it meets all applicable standards and protocols for a field surface.

With a presidential election less than five weeks away, and a new term at the U.S. Supreme Court just over a week away, President Donald Trump says he will, in a matter of days, announce his third nominee to the high court.¬†          The funeral for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose seat he would be filling after she died last week, is not scheduled until next week, but President Trump and other Republican Party leaders have made clear their intent to return the court to its full complement of nine justices as soon as possible.          The announcement is certain to provoke a fierce and partisan confirmation battle in the U.S. Senate. But if the nomination is successful, it could transform the high court in a way perhaps not seen in close to a century, securing a two-thirds majority of conservative jurists that could advance conservative causes like¬†regulating abortion, expanding gun rights, and reining in federal regulations at a speed and scope of its choosing.          To date, President Trump‚Äôs two other appointments ‚Äì Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh ‚Äì have replaced other members of the court‚Äôs right wing. But replacing Justice Ginsburg, for decades a liberal stalwart of the court, would represent a much starker rightward turn.          It would likely see influence shift between the justices ‚Äì namely away from Chief Justice John Roberts, who would cease to be the court‚Äôs ideological center. The conservative justices do not see eye to eye on every issue, a dynamic that could moderate decisions they reach in some areas of the law. But for the most part, it could be this reinforced conservative majority that would be shaping U.S. law for the next¬†15 or 20 years. The only questions would be how radically, and how quickly, the court moves.

There might be no definitive ‚Äúswing‚Äù justice, but the reinforced conservative majority would still have disagreements. How far and how fast the court moves to the right would be moderated, if it‚Äôs moderated, by the chief justice and, perhaps, Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.          ‚ÄúFor conservatives, there‚Äôs still a pathology to go to the middle,‚Äù says Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law. ‚ÄúLiberal justices do what they need to do, but conservative justices tend to want to play ball.‚Äù¬†¬†          There are some recent examples to the contrary, including liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer joining with conservatives in some religious liberty cases. But there have also been times when President Trump‚Äôs two appointees have defied some expectations. In the past term, Justice Gorsuch joined the liberals in voting to expand employment protections for LGBTQ Americans, and in another landmark case, both Trump appointees concurred with a ruling that President Trump can‚Äôt block access to his personal financial records.          And Justice Kavanaugh could prove to be a pivotal vote on one of the issues of most immediate concern to liberals: abortion rights.          Almost from the day it was decided, there¬†have been arguments¬†that Roe v. Wade ‚Äì the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion ‚Äì was poorly reasoned and should be overturned, particularly from conservatives. (Some liberals,¬†including Justice Ginsburg, said the ruling did too much too quickly.)          Whether a court with six conservative justices would directly overturn Roe is unclear, and would probably require Justice Kavanaugh‚Äôs vote. But abortion rights would almost certainly be restricted further, says Professor Ziegler, and restricted at a faster pace than the court has followed in recent decades.          ‚ÄúIt would be a chipping away‚Äù of abortion rights, she adds. ‚ÄúKavanaugh has shown more willingness to erode abortion rights¬†more quickly.‚Äù          So if Roe does get overturned, ‚Äúyou certainly couldn‚Äôt say that it happened overnight,‚Äù says Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University‚Äôs Antonin Scalia Law School.          Indeed, the speed and scope with which the judiciary shapes the law are determined by multiple factors. Judges don‚Äôt shape legal doctrine alone, Justice Ginsburg said in a 1992 speech, but also ‚Äúparticipate in a dialogue with other organs of government, and with the people as well.‚Äù

My mother possessed great engineering skills to boot and could have been one had she continued her studies beyond 3rd standard. She could wield a carpenter‚Äôs saw, a mason's chisel, a metal hacksaw or any other hard tool with equal felicity with which she held a ladle. She cut and sawed and nailed stuff and made useful things or made things useful, as the case might be. She was also an artist and made clay dolls and the Ganapati _murti_ for _puja_ every year. Her _chulhas_ were not only beautiful to behold, they were perfectly made with cement and metal and mud and much in demand. The tiny saris and veshtis and vastras she made for the very small _puja vigrahas_ were a sight to behold. Oh, there was so much of her artistic genes that she had passed on to my elder sisters and even brothers.

That is a blatant lie. I am an insider and I should know better. You see, in 2016, a candidate was planned to emerge as the party's candidate. But unfortunately, that person lost because he was not on ground. He comes around every four years when there is an election taking place. So, Akeredolu won the election in 2017. And since after the primary, most of these governorship aspirants did not support him. Some of them left to fly the flags of other parties, while some remained in the party and worked against him, which was obvious. And to God be the glory, he won the election. Am aware of him having an agreement with one of the major aspirants then. The aspirant suggested that they should go and sign the agreement in the church of his pastor for him to be a witness. Then suddenly, the man just changed his mind at the last minute. So, if the governor, as a candidate of the party then, can go that far, but betrayed, I dont think the fault belongs to him. I can tell you that there was not a binding agreement on the table after the betrayals. Even with that, after the governor emerged victorious at the polls, about 70% of his cabinet was made up of the supporters of the candidates. I can name names. Most of the things you hear are lies. They alleged that the governor is running his government with Team Aketi, but we asked them, "is Funsho Esan a Team Aketi member?" The commissioner for environment was an Abraham's person. The late commissioner for health was an Abraham's person. Princess Oladunni Odu, who is heading one of the most strategic parastatals, is a Borrofice person. I can go on and on like that. You know politicians, when they want to talk, they will say things that will make their stories sell. But we thank God, there is one accord in the party. Recently, almost all the aspirants converged at the Heritage Hotel in Ijapo Estate, Akure, with Chief Akinyulure, the governor himself and others for a family meeting. Andthehy all agreed to work for the success of the party. The deputy governor designate has been visiting towns in Ondo waterside with Olusola Oke. And most of the candidates who have followership, if not all, are on the same page with the governor. If he can win in 2017 without much support, what do you think will happen now that they are now all behind him? I can tell you that if we go to the polls tomorrow, the APC will win convincingly.

Two weeks ago, we published a letter to the editor from a reader in response to Ray Appen‚Äôs column ‚ÄúShould we save local journalism? Do we care?‚Äù In it, Ray, our company‚Äôs founder and longtime publisher, muses about what role local news plays in our lives and wonders where anger for the press is coming from.
 A reader in Johns Creek responded to Ray‚Äôs question and the two of them engaged in a friendly back and forth over email and ultimately the reader agreed to submit a letter to the editor, which we then published.
 In it, he talks about how the news of his youth is missing in today‚Äôs media world. That it is not representative of his concerns and void of information important to him.
 In summary, he believed that it is not that a newspaper‚Äôs readers don‚Äôt care about its newspaper, but that its newspaper does not care about, or recognize, all of its readers‚Äô perspectives.
 Not too long after we published his letter, I got two phone calls, back to back. Both calls began the exact same way.
 ‚ÄúI never do this, but‚Ä¶‚Äù
 The first caller just had to call me and commend the author of the letter that appeared in our newspaper that week. The caller said the author had nailed it by calling Ray out for his high handedness and clear biases, that the media is generally self-riotous and disconnected from the plights of everyday people, and the sooner it gets off its high horse, the sooner it can save its dying industry.
 I thought that he was going to ask for the author‚Äôs phone number to thank him, but he didn‚Äôt, and we ended the conversation with a commitment from me to take the letter seriously and listen more, talk less.
 Not 30 minutes later, I received another call. ‚ÄúI never do this, but‚Ä¶‚Äù
 This time the caller just had to tell me that he‚Äôd just read the letter that we published and thought the author was a kook, that he is sick and tired of the media bashing and that if the reader would stop for a second to think about the source ‚Äî his hometown community newspaper featuring news about local high schools, city council meetings, boy scout troops and the like ‚Äî he might think twice about the absurdity of his assertion.
 He commended me for publishing the letter, despite the fact that the simple willingness to do so pokes a few holes in the claims the author made in the first place.
 In summary, he told me to keep my head down and keep doing what we‚Äôre doing. That its appreciated and of value to the community. I appreciated both calls.
 We take very seriously our responsibility to cover news that is important to our readers. I also believe that sometimes we cover news that is important to our readers before they know it is important to them.
 Don‚Äôt ever hesitate to call me and tell me we need to do a better job. I might not always be able to give you the answer you want, but I‚Äôm always listening.

Liam Delap scored a debut stunner but holders Manchester City needed a late Phil Foden winner to see off Championship Bournemouth 2-1 in the Carabao Cup.
 Delap, the 17-year-old son of former Stoke midfielder Rory, put the holders ahead in style in their third-round tie at the Etihad Stadium but they were immediately pegged back by Sam Surridge.
 City brought big guns Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling off the bench in the latter stages and they eventually snatched victory on 75 minutes when Foden struck after Riyad Mahrez hit the post.
 Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side, who are bidding for a record-equalling eighth League Cup win and a fourth in succession, will now travel to Burnley in the fourth round next week.
 Looking ahead to Sunday‚Äôs clash with Leicester, City boss Guardiola made eight changes from the side which opened the campaign with victory at Wolves on Monday.
 His selections included handing debuts to the impressive striker Delap and American goalkeeper Zack Steffen.
 Tommy Doyle and Taylor Harwood-Bellis were also given opportunities but it proved a sad night for 19-year-old Adrian Bernabe, who was carried off injured before half-time.
 City‚Äôs youthful side threatened early on as Ferran Torres, making his first start since his summer move from Valencia, and Mahrez forced saves from Mark Travers.
 They then took the lead on 18 minutes as Foden slid Delap through on goal with a fine through-ball.
 The teenager took the ball in his stride and swept a left-footed shot into the top corner from just inside the box.
 It was a moment to savour for the youngster but City‚Äôs lead proved short-lived as the Cherries responded within four minutes.
 Surridge was given too much space to turn in the box and buried a low shot past Steffen.
 Both sides suffered an injury blow before half-time as Bournemouth‚Äôs Lloyd Kelly and then Bernabe were forced off.
 Bernabe‚Äôs problem looked particularly serious and City boss Pep Guardiola dashed over to console the youngster as he was wheeled past the technical area on a stretcher.
 City tried to push after the break but Bournemouth held firm and grew in confidence. Surridge was twice denied as first Harwood-Bellis blocked a shot and then Steffen raced out of his area to cut short another charge.
 Guardiola decided to up the tempo just after the hour by summoning De Bruyne and Sterling from the bench.
 The pressure on the Bournemouth back line increased and City eventually made their breakthrough.
 Mahrez struck the woodwork with a low shot and Foden was in the right place to tuck home on the rebound.
 City went in search of more and Delap‚Äôs enthusiasm got the better of him as he crashed into Cherries keeper Mark Travers, collecting a booking for the late challenge.
 City had a late scare when De Bruyne went down after a blow to the head but he was able to complete the game.

With an extra month to prepare for the season, the Rice Lake football team looked to take advantage of additional time as it tries to bounce back from a down year.
 Senior linebacker Scott Kinnick said while pushing the start date practices from early August to early September was disappointing, it also provided motivation to use that time effectively.
 ‚ÄúGoing into it we knew that once it was going to get pushed back a lot of us had the mindset of we have to keep working, keep getting better,‚Äù Kinnick said, ‚Äúbecause this gave us an extra month to get better. It kind of put a damper on everything getting it pushed back another month but it just made us focus on working together as a team ‚Äî getting people to lift, get better and stronger as a team.‚Äù
 Rice Lake was 1-8 overall and 1-6 in the Big Rivers Conference to finish in seventh last season. Rice Lake returns 14 starters this year as it looks to make the most of a shortened schedule.
 Gone are second team all-conference linebacker Tyson Tomesh and defensive lineman Aiden Ferguson, along with departed starters Keith Blechinger, Bradley Hackel and Torien Hubbard.
 In practice leading up to its scrimmage last Friday, 15th-year head coach Dan Hill said the group has really grown together, something even more pivotal in an uncertain year.
 ‚ÄúEverybody talks about teamwork and the team and all that, but do you actually see it happening, where it‚Äôs growing?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs what I like about these guys. It seems like each night we come out here they‚Äôre getting a better handle on what it means to be a great teammate. If that‚Äôs the only thing they got out of it, it would be a great lesson for them.‚Äù
 Rice Lake expects to have better depth in the back end of its defense this season. Senior Alex Belongia had 55 tackles and a team-high three interceptions last year. Also back are seniors Zack Fisher and Tristan Scheurer, while juniors Elliot Nolin and Teagan Scheurer will see more playing time.
 Kinnick will play a major part defensively at inside linebacker. The senior had 69 tackles a season ago, tops among returning players. Senior Andrew Farm and juniors Christian Lindow and Keagen Gunderson will provide depth.
 The Warriors lost their starting quarterback in Tomesh. Tristan Scheurer and junior Cole Fenske are poised to compete for playing time as signal caller for the Warriors.
 Farm is back at fullback after the senior led the team with 463 yards rushing and three scores a season ago. Also in the backfield are senior fullback Fisher (58 carries for 225 yards), and senior halfbacks Jayden Perkins (24 attempts for 78 yards) and Hunter Heller (23 carries for 128 yards). Tristan Scheurer toted the rock 34 times for 248 yards last year.
 Belongia hauled in 22 passes for 301 yards and three touchdowns last year at receiver and should again be a top target when Rice Lake looks to pass.
 Along the line of scrimmage, Hill said 6-foot-1, 250 pound senior Andrew Hillyer has made a lot of progress, while sophomores Parker Owens (5-11, 195) and Nate Carroll (5-11, 203) made big strides in the offseason and will see the field a lot. Senior Colin Scheu (6-2, 185) returns as well as senior Kayden Warren. Warren (6-4, 225) made his commitment to walk-on to Division I FCS powerhouse North Dakota State last week and will be counted on for a big season.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a 6-4 athletic lineman that can run, so they‚Äôre looking at being able to pack pounds on him,‚Äù Hill said of the Bison‚Äôs interest in Warren. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a high motor, high aggression, athletic big kid.‚Äù
 Overall, Hill said the lines won‚Äôt have quite the depth they were hoping as injuries have taken a toll. Fenske, though, said he likes what he has seen in practices as there has been solid development from younger players.
 ‚ÄúI would say we lost a lot of D-lineman last year, O-lineman, but from what I‚Äôve seen lately the younger kids are stepping up and playing a big part in our offense and defense so far,‚Äù he said.
 Rice Lake opens the season Friday at New Richmond, a new member to the Big Rivers after state-wide realignment took effect this season. The Tigers are a growing program with a lot of good athletes, Hill said. New Richmond edged the Warriors 14-13 last season in what was a nonconference contest. New Richmond plays out of the shotgun and spreads out defenses with a mix of run-pass options.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a challenge,‚Äù Hill said of defending New Richmond. ‚ÄúThere are more teams doing it. It‚Äôs different than Menomonie, different than Chippewa. It‚Äôs a little bit unique. The run-pass RPO aspect of it causes you to think a little bit differently than we‚Äôve done in the past.‚Äù
 Rice Lake will play each of the five active Big Rivers teams this year after Eau Claire North and Memorial, along with Superior, had their seasons pushed to an alternate spring schedule. The Warriors home opener is Oct. 3 against River Falls. Rice Lake also hosts Menomonie Oct. 23 and will have a nonconference home game versus Sparta on Oct. 30. Only parents will be allowed to attend games at Pug Lund Field this season though as the conference looks to limit spectators as a precaution.
 In a shortened season with uncertainty each week, the mindset of one game at a time is even more prevalent.
 ‚ÄúWe focus on the week, we focus on what‚Äôs coming up next, because next week is not guaranteed,‚Äù Kinnick said. ‚ÄúEven if it was guaranteed like last year, you focus on what you need to do today to get ready for the game this week.‚Äù
 For the seniors throughout summer it was unknown what fall football would be like. That‚Äôs why for Farm it‚Äôs all about making the most of what‚Äôs given this season. When it became official there would be the opportunity, he knew he would need to do what it takes to make the year meaningful.
 ‚ÄúI would say no regrets,‚Äù Farm said of his goal this year, ‚Äúleaving it all out on the field, so that I don‚Äôt come back when it‚Äôs all over, set and done, I said I gave it my best. I did everything I could.‚Äù
 There has been a positive feeling around the team in practices and the team‚Äôs scrimmage with Menomonie last week. It‚Äôs easy to get wrapped up in wins and losses, Hill said, but the focus should be on executing the team‚Äôs game plan. Football is about improvement and efficiency, he said, and this year more than ever the team is focused on controlling what it can control.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just focused on us getting better every day. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff that happens, just like this pandemic, it‚Äôs out of our control,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe kids are doing a great job of that. They‚Äôre not looking far beyond. It‚Äôs like here we are today, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù
