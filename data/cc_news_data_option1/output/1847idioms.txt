Major media and entertainment law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks says it has informed its A-list clients that its internal data systems were hacked and a vast trove of information on its clients was stolen.
 "We can confirm that we've been victimised by a cyberattack," the New York- based firm said in a statement to Variety.
 "We have notified our clients and our staff. We have hired the world's experts who specialise in this area, and we are working around the clock to address these matters."
 News of the hack surfaced last week, after a hacker group claimed it infiltrated the Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks network and stole a whopping 756 gigabytes of documents on multiple music and entertainment figures.
 Those include clients past and present, among them: Lady Gaga, Madonna, Nicki Minaj, Bruce Springsteen, Mary J. Blige, Ella Mai, Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, Cam Newton, Bette Midler, Jessica Simpson, Priyanka Chopra, Idina Menzel and Run DMC, the hackers claimed.
 The data stolen by the hackers allegedly includes contracts, nondisclosure agreements, phone numbers and email addresses, and private correspondence, the group's claims posted on a dark web forum, according to cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.
 The group behind the attack didn't release all the data they had supposedly purloined. To show the hack was real, they released an excerpt from a contract for Madonna's 2019-20 "Madame X" tour with Live Nation.
 It's evidently a ransomware attack, in which cybercriminals use the threat of releasing the stolen data as leverage to extort payment. It is not known what demands the hackers have made in connection with the theft of Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks data.
 The attack on the law firm - whose clients span music artists, actors and TV personalities, sports stars, and media and entertainment companies - was carried out by a group called "REvil," also known as "Sodinokibi," according to Emsisoft.
 The group has previously targeted companies and organisations including Travelex, the UK-based currency-exchange company, which paid $US2.3 million in bitcoin to hackers after a ransomware attack, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Multilateral institutions have assessed that the COVID-19 global pandemic will leave the world economy worse off than the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Its impact may be worst since the 1929 Great Depression. While the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects the global GDP to contract by -3 percent in 2020, the Indian economy is projected to show a positive growth at 1.9 percent in FY21.The COVID-19 economic crisis is different from the 2008-09 global crisis. While the 2008-09 crisis was mainly a financial crisis leading to a worldwide collapse of demand, the current crisis is a combination of supply-side disruptions and a significant fall in employment, incomes and demand. In order to combat this crisis, India needs a carefully calibrated strategy for exiting the lockdown supported by strong fiscal and monetary stimuli.Slipping into a fall while already on a slideIndia&amp;rsquo;s growth prospects are constrained as it has entered the COVID-19 crisis on the back of an economic downslide. High-frequency indicators highlight the unfolding adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. PMI manufacturing and services contracted to unprecedented levels of 27.4 and 5.4 respectively in April 2020. Power consumption which was already contracting by an average -3.1 percent on a monthly basis over the period August 2019-March 2020, further contracted by -24.7 percent in April 2020. Growth in bank credit fell to 6.1 percent in the fortnight ending 27 March 2020, its lowest level since the fortnight ending 18 August 2017. It continued to remain subdued showing a growth of only 6.7 percent in the fortnight ending 24 April 2020.Fighting our way out: policy stimuliOn the monetary side, the repo rate was reduced to a historic low of 4.4 percent on 27 March 2020. Numerous liquidity-augmenting and regulatory measures have also been undertaken since then. Through these measures, an additional liquidity of Rs 3.74 lakh crore was released into the economy. Further, on 17 April 2020, the RBI lowered the reverse repo rate to 3.75 percent and proposed to inject an additional liquidity of Rs 1 lakh crore.The extent of fiscal stimulus that the government can provide is constrained by the near-zero growth of the centre&amp;rsquo;s gross tax revenues in 2019-20 and the likelihood of a similar performance in 2020-21. Center&amp;rsquo;s gross taxes contracted by -0.8 percent during April-February 2019-20 with direct taxes contracting by -3.5 percent and indirect taxes witnessing a subdued growth of 1.6 percent. We expect the 2020-21 tax revenue growth to be also much below the budgeted growth since both GDP growth and buoyancy assumptions are not likely to be met.Recognizing this, the central government has announced its revised gross borrowing program for 2020-21 which indicates that the government may be willing to uplift its budgeted deficit from 3.5 percent to close to 5.5 percent of GDP. The state governments have also been asking for a relaxation in their borrowing limit. Individual state governments may need to modify their Fiscal Responsibility Legislations (FRLs) to increase their borrowing limit for enabling a countercyclical response from their side also. We expect that considered together, they may account for an overall borrowing of 3.5 percent of GDP this year. Thus, the combined fiscal deficit of center and states may be close to 9 percent of GDP.Higher borrowing limits will facilitate the central and state governments to cover their budgeted expenditures which may need to be restructured in the light of the COVID- related revised priorities. The lower global crude prices would also create additional fiscal space in the form of lower subsidies for petroleum products and lower expenditure on transport and other operational expenses. Together, the higher borrowing limit and the additional fiscal space created through lower crude prices would enable the government to mount a fiscal stimulus to cover (a) relief related programs, (b) specified bailout packages, and (c) additional direct expenditures on infrastructure particularly on health- related sectors to boost demand.Need a smart lockdown exit strategyTo conclude, India is now in lockdown 3.0, which is slated to end on May 17, 2020. As the economy opens up, the resumption of activities needs to be according to a well-thought-out exit strategy. Different output sectors may resume at a different pace as the health pandemic is gradually brought under control. Sectoral targeting of fiscal stimulus should be synchronized with the opening up of the relevant sectors. India&amp;rsquo;s 2020-21 growth would depend critically on the pace of opening up of the sectors and the extent of stimulus.In terms of rebooting the economy, new manufacturing capacity needs to be attracted in India which would require additional budgetary allocation. Many state governments are actively participating in this effort by announcing, through ordinances, changes in land and labour laws. As things begin to normalize, there may be a need to revise budget estimates for tax and non-tax revenue growth, sectoral expenditure priorities, and dimensions of fiscal imbalance including changes in fiscal and revenue deficits.-DK Srivastava is Chief Policy Advisor, EY India and former Director, Madras School of Economics.

Members of Congress have been actively pursuing proposals for another round of stimulus checks to help reinvigorate the economy and offer support for those across the country suffering the coronavirus pandemic. There are at least four different proposals in the works, with many of them upping the ante to $2,000 checks per installment.
 While the idea of more Americans receiving financial assistance sounds like a no-brainer, there's another side of the discussion that has to do with the impact it will have on the government's spending. This is why some officials in the White House are a little worried about the prospect. A story in _The Washington Post_ reveals that six administration officials and four external advisers are growing worrisome about the debt that is building up, and adding another stimulus package would only worsen the situation. With unemployment piling up, President Donald Trump doesn't appear to be in a hurry to sign off on another package after the first one equated to $2 trillion.
 Appearing on _This Week_ with George Stephanopoulos, National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow said "I think that many people would like to just pause for a moment and take a look at the economic impact of this massive assistance program." Kudlow also shared with reporters that they're taking a wait-and-see approach when it comes to issuing another recovery program. "We just had another big infusion. … Let's see what happens," Kudlow said. "As we move into the reopening phase this month, maybe spillover to June, let's have a look at it before we decide who, what, where, when."
 As for what another stimulus package could look like, a proposal put together by senators Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Ed Markey would see a $2,000 check go out each month the pandemic lasts. It would also continue for three months after the pandemic is officially determined to be over per a ruling by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Harris has strongly been advocating for more help to come into the homes of Americans. "The CARES Act gave Americans an important one-time payment, but it's clear that wasn't nearly enough to meet the needs of this historic crisis." Harris said in a statement. "The Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act will ensure families have the resources they need to make ends meet. I am eager to continue working with Senators Sanders and Markey as we push to pass this bill immediately."

Jackson Cobb had not only one, but two seasons ripped out from under him during his senior year.


  The Arkansas baseball signee tore his ACL in the first football game of the season and had to watch from the sideline as Texarkana (Texas) Pleasant Grove won its second Class 4A-DII state title in three years.


  Determined to play baseball, Cobb got through rehab quickly and was on the diamond just five and a half months after his surgery, but he played in only a handful of games before the coronavirus pandemic wiped out the rest of the year.


  Despite the disappointment of missing virtually all of both seasons, he has stayed positive about the whole situation.


  “It definitely was not how I pictured my senior year going,” Cobb said. “Obviously it sucks not getting to play baseball, but I’ve also been putting in some work. … It’s helped me recover from (the torn ACL) and helped with my therapy and stuff.”


  Even though he was playing, Cobb was admittedly not 100 percent when he returned to action, but he should be fully recovered in about 1.5 months. That is in plenty of time before he arrives in Fayetteville as part of the Razorbacks’ third-ranked 2020 signing class for what is expected to be an ultra-competitive fall ball.


  However, you wouldn’t have known he wasn’t completely healthy by the way he started the season. In five games, Cobb hit .563 with a whopping four home runs. That is a stark contrast to the one long ball he hit his entire junior season, but - looking at the positives once again - he thinks the torn ACL is to credit for the power surge.


  “I hurt my right knee, which is my lead leg hitting since I’m left-handed,” Cobb said. “So I think that made me sit back more on my back leg and stay balanced.”


  When not hampered by a knee injury, Cobb has also showcased excellent speed. He hit a state-record 11 triples and had a school-record 26 stolen bases as a junior, when he also posted a .398 batting average and .527 on-base percentage.


  That speed made him a dangerous wide receiver on the gridiron, as well. He was the Hawks’ top returning receiver before he went down with the injury and had a chance to continue playing in college if he wanted to take that route.


  Southwestern University, a Division III school in Georgetown, Texas, actively recruited him to play both sports and his football coach wanted him to pursue similar opportunities at Division II schools like Southern Arkansas and Harding. There was a time when Cobb even considered becoming a walk-on football player at Louisiana-Lafayette, where he was originally committed to play baseball.


  Although he won’t strap on the pads for the Razorbacks, Cobb’s experience playing football certainly helped prepare him for the large crowds at Baum- Walker Stadium. Pleasant Grove appeared in three straight state championship games that averaged 17,356 fans at AT&T Stadium.


  “I’m not nervous to play in front of a big crowd at all, I actually prefer it,” Cobb said. “I was the punt returner my sophomore year and the first time I went out on the field and I looked up, it was crazy. There’s nothing like playing (there).”


  The fact that Cobb will be playing in Fayetteville is relatively new. As mentioned above, he was previously committed to Louisiana-Lafayette, a baseball powerhouse in the Sun Belt.


  It wasn’t until this past fall that he flipped his pledge and signed with the Razorbacks.


  “To be honest, I really didn’t know how good I was,” Cobb said. “My sophomore year, I got my first DI offer to UL and I went ahead and committed because I thought that was where I wanted to go.


  “I was committed there for almost two years and their coach, Tony Robichaux, died and that was a really big deal for me. They got a new coach and I liked Coach (Matt) Deggs, but other than that, they didn’t really contact me a lot, so I was kind of iffy about it for a couple of months and was like, ‘I’m just going to de-commit.’”


  For Cobb, it was a dream come true. Even though he went to school on the Texas side of Texarkana, he admitted Arkansas was where he wanted to play all along.


  His father, Mike, signed with the Razorbacks out of high school in 1982 - the same year Dave Van Horn was named the Southwest Conference Newcomer of the Year as an infielder for Norm DeBriyn.


  Cobb’s father ended up transferring to Seminole State C.C. and finished his career at Sam Houston State, but his grandfather remained an Arkansas fans and that had an impact on him.


  It also doesn’t hurt that one of Cobb’s former teammates - right-handed pitcher Caleb Bolden - plays for the Razorbacks. Despite being a freshman when Bolden was a senior at Pleasant Grove, Cobb said the pair became really good friends and still keep in tough.


  At 5-foot-11, 170 pounds, Cobb is a natural middle infielder and said he hopes to play shortstop at Arkansas, but would be willing to play wherever he’s asked.


  Considering the talent coming to Fayetteville with him in the 2020 class, playing time will be tough to come by, but he is confident the group could do something special during their time with the Razorbacks.


  “Every kid wants to win a College World Series,” Cobb said. “That’s what we’re going to do for Arkansas - I can guarantee that.”

Observing that the coronavirus pandemic has shown the existing international system's limitations, India's envoy in the US has said that the world after COVID-19 needs a template of globalisation based on fairness, equality and humanity.


  Economic growth and human welfare need to go hand in hand and there is a need to ensure equitable, affordable and timely access to health products and technologies for all, India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said in a virtual interaction with Asia Group hosted by former US Ambassador to India Richard Verma on Monday.


  "The current pandemic shows the limitations of the existing international system. In the post-COVID world, we need a template of globalisation based on fairness, equality and humanity," Sandhu said.


  Indian Pharma companies are global leaders in producing affordable low cost medicines and vaccines, he said, adding that India is a reliable partner for providing affordable medicines to the US.


  "Our long-standing and robust partnership with the US in the area of health and scientific research has further deepened during the time of pandemic," he said.


  Similarly, India has been working with the US private sector in vaccine development. Serum Institute of India has collaborated with Codagenix Inc - a New York based clinical-stage Biotechnology Company - to rapidly co-develop a live-attenuated vaccine against the emergent coronavirus, Sandhu said.


  Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad has collaborated with the University of Wisconsin Madison and the vaccine company FluGen to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 called CoroFlu, he said.


  Sandhu said that the containment of the virus and economic recovery will require a strong international cooperation to complement the national policy efforts.


  India is also working with its international partners, including its neighbours, to combat the pandemic. It has delivered medical supplies and assistance to over 123 partner countries, he said.


  "We have taken the lead in the SAARC region through an Emergency Relief corpus with an initial seed fund of USD 10 million. Our Rapid Response Medical Teams have been deployed in the Maldives, Kuwait. Our health experts are sharing best practices through online training for our neighbours and are active in global efforts to develop remedies and vaccines," the Indian diplomat said.

Understandably, each country has erected its line of defence with the aim to minimise the loss of life.


  "The global health crisis has brought in its wake an economic crisis of a scale that has not been seen in a long time.


  "Grappling with these twin crises, governments today face an impossible choice between public health and economy. We will need a delicate balancing act. We need to revitalise our economies as well as enhance resilience, scalability and sustainability of our healthcare systems," he added.

Today, we are all mourning the loss of Macon, Georgia native, rock & roll pioneer Richard Wayne Penniman, better known as Little Richard. He died Saturday in his Nashville home at the age of 87. From the top of his mile-high pompadour hair, to the shiniest of shiny shoes on his feet, Little Richard was a larger than life, magnetic force that not only changed the musical landscape, he knocked it flat out of its chair and upside down. As Stevie Van Zandt said in a tweet, "{Little Richard} embodied the spirit and soul of RocknRoll. He opened his mouth and out came liberation. His amazing records and attitude combined with his flamboyant androgyny would define the fearlessness of the Artform and influence all that came after." In his honor, we've turned to the magical time machine known as YouTube and are transporting ourselves to 5 of our favorite performances from the man himself.

  On Friday, lawyers for the state asked the appeals court to cancel the presidential primary, saying over 4,600 additional election workers would have to be hired in an unsafe environment, many of them in areas where the absence of contested races otherwise required few election hires.


  Kurzon said canceling the presidential primary would depress turnout, cheating candidates in contested races for Congress and state offices of a robust number of votes.


  He also noted that the primary was occurring anyway in the downstate region hit hardest by the coronavirus.


  “Judge Torres’ well-reasoned decision must stand for reasons of law and equity, to protect the sliver of sovereignty awarded to each Citizen, the right to vote, as well as their guaranteed rights to free speech, due process and equal protection under the law," the lawyer noted.

_New York, 12 mag 01:41 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Il presidente degli Stati Uniti, Donald Trump, ha affermato di essere colui che ha richiesto a tutto lo staff della Casa Bianca di indossare mascherine protettive, anche se ha difeso la sua scelta di non indossarne una durante la conferenza stampa. Lo riporta l'emittente "Cnn". A Trump, parlando con i giornalisti nel Rose Garden, è stato chiesto perché non richiedesse ai membri del personale della Casa Bianca di indossare i rivestimenti per il viso. "Se sono a una certa distanza da me o a una certa distanza l'una dall'altra, lo fanno. Nel mio caso, non sono vicino a nessuno. Vorrei essere vicino a questi due signori, sono laboriosi, grandi uomini", ha scherzato il presidente. "Se guardate tutte quelle persone laggiù, ognuna di quelle che vedo, questi sono impiegati della Casa Bianca, sono rappresentanti della Casa Bianca, sono dirigenti della Casa Bianca e tutti hanno una maschera. Quasi tutti quelli che ho visto oggi hanno indossato una maschera", ha osservato Trump. Alla domanda se fosse stato lui a richiederlo, Trump ha risposto di sì.

The coronavirus has changed nearly every aspect of life in the U.S. since the outbreak first began. Planning for elections has become a particular challenge for states just beginning to lift stay-at-home orders and starting to phase in plans to safely reopen businesses.


  Public health and safety concerns for voters and poll workers has led to the postponement of municipal, state and even presidential primary elections and has governors, secretaries of state and lawmakers looking into legislation to allow expanded absentee voting and early voting options as well as introducing mail-in voting.


  In April, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu announced the state would allow voters to cast mail-in ballots in the November general election if the coronavirus is still a factor this fall. Sununu said the state was considering other voting alternatives, too, including "drive-up voting," in which a voter would not have to leave his or her vehicle.


  Last week, Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin said he will pursue legislation that would expand in-person early voting in September and November and permit any voter to request a mail-in ballot for either the primary or general election. Under the secretary's proposal, voters could seek mail-in ballots for either or both elections without an excuse, and local election officials could mail them as soon as possible.


  Rhode Island has made the June 2 Presidential Primary a "predominantly mail ballot" election with plans to have fewer polling places open for in-person voting. In a letter on the Department of State website, Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea encourages all Rhode Island voters to apply for a mail ballot to vote in the upcoming Presidential Primary.


  In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, do you support mail-in voting for upcoming elections? Why or why not?

 Open Meeting Law complaints result in two votes
 With two Open Meeting Law complaints filed against the Select Board over the posting of board meetings for the hiring of Interim Town Administrator Rick LaFond, board members voted again on his contract Tuesday night.
 They also voted to have town counsel respond to those complaints that the board did not post notice of meetings April 10 and April 16 for LaFond's appointment within 48 hours of those meetings as required.
 Select Board member Robert Belbin defended the board's decision. He said they were under the gun with former Town Administrator Michael Milanoski's last day April 17 and their desire to get an interim administrator on board. Other board members agreed it's a legitimate reason.
 Chairman Mark Townsend said he recommends that the board vote to approve the contact again out of an abundance of caution. The board's vote was 4-1. Belbin again voted against the contract.
 The board also took a vote to ask town counsel to respond to the Open Meeting Law complaints. The vote was 4-1, with Belbin voting in opposition. He said the board itself should respond, but he was overruled.
 So long
 If the annual town election had been held in April as planned, Select Board member Alan Dunham would not have been online participating in the board's Tuesday night meeting.
 While he decided not to seek re-election to a third three-year term, he continued to serve on the board. Tuesday night, Dunham said his heart is not in it and he planned to resign by 4 p.m. Wednesday.
 Select Board reorganizes
 Mark Townsend was appointed as chairman of the Select Board, and Sarah Hewins was appointed vice chairman, during a reorganization of the board Tuesday.
 Townsend was serving as chairman after Selectman Ron Clarke stepped down from that role. Alan Dunham nominated Townsend, and Robert Belbin nominated Hewins.
 Citizens' participation to resume on Zoom
 The Select Board will begin meetings with public participation again for the first time since the board started meeting remotely due to the coronavirus.
 Chairman Mark Townsend suggested that public participation resume on Zoom, with residents given a link so they can be heard by board members.
 Select Board members agreed residents should have a right to speak at the start of meetings under the rules of public participation. Alan Dunham said the decision was overdue.
 Next meeting
 The next regular meeting of the Select Board will be held at 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 19.

Moreover, a new theme song and the absence of Buddy Murphy from the ringside made it seem like Rollins is having a change of heart. Having said that, I feel it is not the right time for Rollins to turn face because RAW needs top helps at the moment. Following Money in the Bank 2020 event, it will be interesting to see what's in store for Seth Rollins.

PUNTERS in the Lockyer Valley will welcome the sound of thundering hooves at the Lockyer Valley Turf Club on Saturday.


  And while social distancing restrictions remain in effect, meaning members of the public will unfortunately not be allowed to attend, Lockyer Valley Turf Club president Terry Kirkwood said there were plenty of ways people could tune in.


  “If they’ve got mobile phones, they can watch on the TAB app, and we’ll be on Sky and Thoroughbred Central if they have pay TV,” he said.


  “It will just be us and the Gold Coast broadcasting on Saturday, so we should get plenty of focus.”


  The meet is a welcome event for the area, and it will be the first time the club holds racing using their new stalls.


  Disappointingly, the Gatton Cup previously scheduled for May 30 remains cancelled.


  “This is the only one we’ve got for this month. We’ve also got one coming up in June,” Kirkwood said.


  “I think at the moment Racing Queensland are just planning things out month- by-month.


  “There’s no point trying to plan things out too far because they don’t know what restrictions are going to be like.”


  He said co-ordinating the race day was a complicated process, as there were a range of new measures that had to be put in place behind the scenes to keep people separate and safe.


  “The racing industry is very lucky to be racing,” he said.


  “A lot of people are unaware, but there are a lot of protocols we have to follow, and they’re very strict.”


  In addition to a ban on public attendance, social distancing requirements must be adhered to, masks must be worn, and everyone who attends the club must pass a temperature check before being allowed inside.


  Inside, site staff, jockeys, and trainers remain segregated from one another, and only limited people are allowed to handle equipment, most of which has to be sanitised after each race.


  For more information on this weekend’s event, visit the Racing Queensland website.

Don't you just like to shake sometimes?" And then in the call and response form familiar to Southern churchgoers, he says, "Everybody say alright," and the crowd shouted, "alright!" The singing, dancing, shaking, bouncing, and non-stop action in this performance shows exactly what a force Little Richard was and why, although he is now physically gone, this architect of modern music will live on forever in song and dance.

Robinette discounted these numbers, saying that actually, it's much more complex than this. He said the county views their use of "short term revenue levels to base their projections on future sales tax revenue fails to consider current events, creating long term budgeting error." He continues to say that, "With the pandemic and current virus-induced recession, with 33 million jobs lost nationwide, we believe the next several years will be even further out of line with City of Rockingham and State projections and we prefer to project sales tax revenues from a more conservative point of view for budgeting purposes."

When you hit "play" and hear the opening sounds of "Little White Lines," the first song on "Thought Balloon," you could say you're listening to the new album by The Trap Dorz, or the new album by Roslindale singer-songwriter- rocker Andy Hollinger. They've been one and the same for a few years now, with Hollinger making use of the "band" name when other artists are playing with him.
 Hollinger's first album of originals, "I'm not Here Right Now," under his own name, came out in 2004. The Trap Dorz have made appearances on various local compilation albums over the years, with covers of songs by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, and they've played live a couple of times.
 Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to MetroWestDailyNews.com to sign up for Entertainment Headlines and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.
 On "Thought Balloon," recorded in his home-based Chez Hey Studio, Hollinger is playing almost every instrument (guitar, bass, dobro, slide guitar, mandola, piano, a digital drum program), and sings all of the leads as well as most of the backing harmonies. It's a Trap Dorz album because he's joined on one song by Stephen Born, playing blues harp, and on two others by Jennifer Lewis Bennett doing harmony vocals.
 And it's quite a mix of different sorts of music, with tastes of pop, rock, country, and honky-tonk, and moods ranging all the way from happy to sad.
 "When I was asked to pick a genre for it, I went with singer-songwriter," said Hollinger. "When I was asked for a second category, I picked roots rock."
 Speaking now, by phone, he was asked about the genesis of the name "The Trap Dorz."
 "Oh, it was because I fell through a trap door, and broke my ankle," he said. "That was six years ago, and I was laid up for a while. It was something significant that happened to me, and I thought it sounded like a good band name."
    Framingham's ATAC arts center desperate for $70,000 to avoid closure after coronavirus cancellations  
 But, hold on a moment. There's a song on the album titled "Foreign Accent Syndrome" that's about a guy who gets hit on the head by a bottle and starts speaking in a foreign accent. Is there some sort of accident connection?
 "No, that one was just a story I heard, maybe on NPR," he said. "It was about a real syndrome; it's documented. And I thought it sounded like a good song title."
 The subjects of the album's songs are as different as their sounds. "Lost and Spaced" is a metaphorical piece about being lost in life, and has nothing to do with the similarly sounding TV show. "All I Do," featuring some hot double- tracked slide guitar work, tells of a fellow who's driven to drink because the woman he pines for is hanging around with other guys. "Deep Dark Hole," Hollinger admitted, is autobiographical.
 "I wrote it while I was recovering from the accident," he said. "It was great. People came to visit me and help rake leaves, and other things."

 It's also the one song on the album where Hollinger doesn't sound like Hollinger.
 "I was sort of trying to channel The Band on that one," he said. "I intentionally tried to make the vocals sound a little different from the way I normally sound. Levon Helm was sort of what I was going for."
 Another song, "In the Rain," a sad ballad about a broken relationship, has another personal touch. It includes Hollinger's only attempt at whistling on a recording.
 "There was a nostalgia factor to it," he said. "I grew up in a little town outside of Pittsburgh, and there was a long road to get into the town off of a highway. My father would often commute on the bus, and coming home, he would walk about a mile on that road, and you could hear him whistling from up the hill. He had a really good, melodic whistle, and I'm trying to carry on the tradition of whistling."
 So, why has it been 15 years between albums?
 "Well, I was busy. I was working full time [at a day job], I played guitar with some other people in town for a while, backing up the local singer- songwriter Thea Hopkins and then Lenny Solomon, and I was playing on the compilation albums. But I'd still been writing songs, and the songs were accumulating. So, I thought it was time."
 And when it was all done, it was time to program the album, to pick the order of the songs.
 "I thought that part was going to be tough, but it fell into place more quickly than I thought it would," said Hollinger. "I did shift the songs around some, but two of them are my wife's favorites. And the last one, 'I've Just Got To,' which is several years old, is one she's always liked. So, I wanted to end the album with that one. You know, it starts out with a pretty good rocker, and it ends with another full-band, electric guitar song. And I tried to intersperse the quieter, slower ones, tried to come up with some kind of a flow."
 "Thought Balloon" by The Trap Dorz is on Lowbudget Records. Take a listen at lowbudgetrecords.com, where you can buy downloads or a CD. A digital version will also be available soon on Apple, Spotify and YouTube Music.

The coronavirus has changed nearly every aspect of life in the U.S. since the outbreak first began. Planning for elections has become a particular challenge for states just beginning to lift stay-at-home orders and starting to phase in plans to safely reopen businesses.
 Public health and safety concerns for voters and poll workers has led to the postponement of municipal, state and even presidential primary elections and has governors, secretaries of state and lawmakers looking into legislation to allow expanded absentee voting and early voting options as well as introducing mail-in voting.
 In April, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu announced the state would allow voters to cast mail-in ballots in the November general election if the coronavirus is still a factor this fall. Sununu said the state was considering other voting alternatives, too, including "drive-up voting," in which a voter would not have to leave his or her vehicle.
 Last week, Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin said he will pursue legislation that would expand in-person early voting in September and November and permit any voter to request a mail-in ballot for either the primary or general election. Under the secretary's proposal, voters could seek mail-in ballots for either or both elections without an excuse, and local election officials could mail them as soon as possible.
 Rhode Island has made the June 2 Presidential Primary a "predominantly mail ballot" election with plans to have fewer polling places open for in-person voting. In a letter on the Department of State website, Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea encourages all Rhode Island voters to apply for a mail ballot to vote in the upcoming Presidential Primary.
 In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, do you support mail-in voting for upcoming elections? Why or why not?

 Open Meeting Law complaints result in two votes
 With two Open Meeting Law complaints filed against the Select Board over the posting of board meetings for the hiring of Interim Town Administrator Rick LaFond, board members voted again on his contract Tuesday night.
 They also voted to have town counsel respond to those complaints that the board did not post notice of meetings April 10 and April 16 for LaFond's appointment within 48 hours of those meetings as required.
 Select Board member Robert Belbin defended the board's decision. He said they were under the gun with former Town Administrator Michael Milanoski's last day April 17 and their desire to get an interim administrator on board. Other board members agreed it's a legitimate reason.
 Chairman Mark Townsend said he recommends that the board vote to approve the contact again out of an abundance of caution. The board's vote was 4-1. Belbin again voted against the contract.
 The board also took a vote to ask town counsel to respond to the Open Meeting Law complaints. The vote was 4-1, with Belbin voting in opposition. He said the board itself should respond, but he was overruled.
 So long
 If the annual town election had been held in April as planned, Select Board member Alan Dunham would not have been online participating in the board's Tuesday night meeting.
 While he decided not to seek re-election to a third three-year term, he continued to serve on the board. Tuesday night, Dunham said his heart is not in it and he planned to resign by 4 p.m. Wednesday.
 Select Board reorganizes
 Mark Townsend was appointed as chairman of the Select Board, and Sarah Hewins was appointed vice chairman, during a reorganization of the board Tuesday.
 Townsend was serving as chairman after Selectman Ron Clarke stepped down from that role. Alan Dunham nominated Townsend, and Robert Belbin nominated Hewins.
 Citizens' participation to resume on Zoom
 The Select Board will begin meetings with public participation again for the first time since the board started meeting remotely due to the coronavirus.
 Chairman Mark Townsend suggested that public participation resume on Zoom, with residents given a link so they can be heard by board members.
 Select Board members agreed residents should have a right to speak at the start of meetings under the rules of public participation. Alan Dunham said the decision was overdue.
 Next meeting
 The next regular meeting of the Select Board will be held at 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 19.

“While these measures will help, the reality is that about 68% of UVM’s budget is directed toward personnel costs. Consequently, this most important budget line must be examined,” he stated. “As we are seeing at research universities across the country, including such wealthy private ones as Yale, Harvard, Stanford, and Princeton, maintaining our financial well-being may necessarily impact salaries and benefits as well as staffing levels throughout the university.”
 Asked at the conference about specifics regarding potential staff reductions, Garimella said he can’t comment about those who have collective bargaining agreements.
 “We are one of the state’s largest employers, and I take that responsibility very seriously,” he said. “I personally would like to do all we can to minimize the impact, especially for those at the lower end of the spectrum here. We have put in multiple measures in place such as hiring freezes and such, and as you might imagine, as a large employer we see a fair amount of attrition over time, so we might use some of that.”
 He said there’s also been talk with employees about them working less hours or not working over the summer.
 “These are voluntary options,” he said. “Our goal is to treat all of our employees with respect and care.”
 He said the school will look to cut as many costs as it can before cutting personnel.
 Much of the released statement addressed expected drops in fall enrollment.
 “Even tried and true methods, such as using early-May admitted student deposit data as an indicator of fall class size, are no longer valid,” stated Garimella. “Recent national surveys say four-year colleges and universities can expect up to a 20% drop in enrollment and should not rely on deposits as a predictor of the number of students who will show up in the fall. More students are actively considering gap years, are choosing to stay close to home, or are holding seats but waiting to make a final decision.”

Tokyo, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 12th May, 2020 ) :Japan's hugely popular baseball league could could start as soon as June after its coronavirus postponement, according to the sport's commissioner, raising the hopes of fans.


  Atsushi Saito, commissioner for Nippon Professional Baseball, met Monday with infection experts and separately held talks with representatives of Japan's 12 professional teams, which he said would work towards a June start.


  "The 12 teams agreed to make efforts so that the season can start in the latter half of June, on the condition that all necessary preparations can be made while carefully monitoring the spread of the infection," Saito said in a statement.


  The announcement on Monday evening came as domestic media reported the baseball season, originally scheduled to open on March 20, could start on June 19\.


  Baseball is Japan's most popular sport, with even youth leagues getting national television coverage.


  Saito said it was too soon to set a date, adding that he would monitor developments in Taiwan and South Korea, where professional teams have returned to action largely behind closed doors.

It was another banner year for Costco as its U.S. operations landed the No. 5 spot on the PG 100, thanks to some of the highest-volume stores on the planet. Its 548 U.S. locations averaged about $190 million in sales, with most of that volume coming from core grocery categories and fresh food. Forty percent, or $59.7 billion, of Costco’s global sales come from a category that the company calls “food and sundries,” which includes dry and packaged foods, groceries, snack foods, candy, cleaning suppliers, and alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. The fresh food category — meat, produce, deli and bakery — accounted for 13.4%, or nearly $20 billion, of total global sales. Costco continued to gain shares in the food and consumables world as it added 16 new U.S. locations in its most recent fiscal year and continued to generate mid- single-digit same-store sales, excluding fuel.

Washington, May 12 (PTI) Observing that the coronavirus pandemic has shown the existing international system's limitations, India's envoy in the US has said that the world after COVID-19 needs a template of globalisation based on fairness, equality and humanity.


  Economic growth and human welfare need to go hand in hand and there is a need to ensure equitable, affordable and timely access to health products and technologies for all, India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said in a virtual interaction with Asia Group hosted by former US Ambassador to India Richard Verma on Monday.


  "The current pandemic shows the limitations of the existing international system. In the post-COVID world, we need a template of globalisation based on fairness, equality and humanity," Sandhu said.


  Indian Pharma companies are global leaders in producing affordable low cost medicines and vaccines, he said, adding that India is a reliable partner for providing affordable medicines to the US.


  "Our long-standing and robust partnership with the US in the area of health and scientific research has further deepened during the time of pandemic," he said.


  Similarly, India has been working with the US private sector in vaccine development. Serum Institute of India has collaborated with Codagenix Inc - a New York based clinical-stage Biotechnology Company - to rapidly co-develop a live-attenuated vaccine against the emergent coronavirus, Sandhu said.


  Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad has collaborated with the University of Wisconsin- Madison and the vaccine company FluGen to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 called CoroFlu, he said.


  Sandhu said that the containment of the virus and economic recovery will require a strong international cooperation to complement the national policy efforts.


  India is also working with its international partners, including its neighbours, to combat the pandemic. It has delivered medical supplies and assistance to over 123 partner countries, he said.


  "We have taken the lead in the SAARC region through an Emergency Relief corpus with an initial seed fund of USD 10 million. Our Rapid Response Medical Teams have been deployed in the Maldives, Kuwait. Our health experts are sharing best practices through online training for our neighbours and are active in global efforts to develop remedies and vaccines," the Indian diplomat said.


  Noting that much has changed in the last few weeks, Sandhu said that the world looks a completely different place as nation after nation has taken shelter at home to stop the relentless march of the invisible enemy. Understandably, each country has erected its line of defence with the aim to minimise the loss of life.


  "The global health crisis has brought in its wake an economic crisis of a scale that has not been seen in a long time.


  "Grappling with these twin crises, governments today face an impossible choice between public health and economy. We will need a delicate balancing act. We need to revitalise our economies as well as enhance resilience, scalability and sustainability of our healthcare systems," he added.

I was working full time [at a day job], I played guitar with some other people in town for a while, backing up the local singer- songwriter Thea Hopkins and then Lenny Solomon, and I was playing on the compilation albums. But I'd still been writing songs, and the songs were accumulating. So, I thought it was time."


  And when it was all done, it was time to program the album, to pick the order of the songs.


  "I thought that part was going to be tough, but it fell into place more quickly than I thought it would," said Hollinger. "I did shift the songs around some, but two of them are my wife's favorites. And the last one, 'I've Just Got To,' which is several years old, is one she's always liked. So, I wanted to end the album with that one. You know, it starts out with a pretty good rocker, and it ends with another full-band, electric guitar song. And I tried to intersperse the quieter, slower ones, tried to come up with some kind of a flow."

Entering the 2019 season, the prevailing opinion was that Jones was unlikely to see the field until the Giants were officially out of the playoff hunt by November or December. Stunningly, it only took two games and an 0-2 start for ownership, management, and the coaching staff to pull the plug. Barring injury or a meltdown by Jones, Eli's days as a starting quarterback for the New York Giants were over.

Marshall: This pandemic is also creating some opportunities that may reduce disparities in the long term. We have to think about the positives. The pandemic has given schools a push to move everything online. There will be an incredible utility for this even after the pandemic has ended. For instance, schools may now be able to tailor learning to specific kids by supplementing their classroom education with online material. It is often a struggle to meet the learning level of all students. With virtual content, students can access gifted and advanced learning opportunities that are otherwise unavailable in a school building that is short on staff with 1,500 students. But now that all curricula are digital, it is easier to pull a kid out of class and move them ahead online.

There, it's exposed to a testing strip embedded with laboratory-made antibodies, the specific blood proteins made by the body’s immune system when it detects an infection. If the antigens and antibodies interact, the test is positive.

In each of the Leadership Tomorrow classes, she said, members learn things such as how to call people to action, manage a team, how to be a good collaborator and what issues are affecting their communities. They also meet with current elected leaders to hear them discuss what their offices do and what it takes to hold their respective positions.
 “I think for them (class members), it is really helpful that they go into it with their eyes open so they know what it is they are wanting to do and what is going to happen once they are in that seat,” Hendricks said.
 Bethany Guzinski, who is running unopposed for a Ward 3 Grand Island City Council seat, was a part of the most recent class.
 Guzinski said she chose to be a part of Leadership Tomorrow because she thought it would offer her a number of opportunities she would not have had otherwise.
 During her class sessions, she said, she learned how to serve on various boards and was part of discussions on Robert’s Rules of Order and parliamentary procedure. She was “about three-fourths of the way through” her Leadership Tomorrow class when she decided to file for election to the City Council.
 “Leadership Tomorrow really reinforced the idea of considering all viewpoints of an issue and seeing all sides of a problem before making a decision,” Guzinski said. “I think that will help in my role on the City Council.”
 Tim Mayfield, who is running for a Ward B seat on the Grand Island Public Schools Board of Education, said as a St. Louis native who moved to Grand Island from Omaha in 2003 or 2004, he knew Leadership Tomorrow was a “good board to help with leadership skills, networking and things like that.”

Prof. Siesling says, "This data on cancer diagnoses in the Netherlands is one of the most unique in the world because of the nationwide coverage and the promptness with which it is made available. Based on it, we can respond rapidly to the decline in diagnoses. Other countries may be able to confirm their suspect feelings on effects of the crisis based on the Dutch trends and to take measures to ensure that regular care is resumed covering all parts of the care pathway."
