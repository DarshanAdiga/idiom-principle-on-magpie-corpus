“It’s hard to predict what’s going to happen especially with this virus,” Pruitt said. “Going back and drawing on my experiences from high school, you get creative, you find a way. Whatever the outcome is, whenever we do start back it’s going to be the same for everybody.”
 “It’s something where you have to think outside the box and figure out a way to be efficient with your time. … Every team’s going to be different. Every player is going to be different. Some are going to have lots of experience, some are going to have absolutely none, but you have to find a way to figure out the guys that can help you have success.”
 While the 2020 season may be in jeopardy it is only part of the challenge’s college teams are facing. With the NCAA extending its suspension of in-person athletic activities until May 30th, on campus recruiting camps are unlikely to occur.
 This period helps coaches evaluate recruits in person, helping them get a feel for whether they’d be a good fit.
 With that period likely lost, Pruitt says they have to lean on what they see on tape.
 “I think it’s very similar to what’s going on in the NFL,” Pruitt said. “They have to go back and look what’s on tape. They have to go back and trust their scouts in their scouting department. It’s the same for us. We have to gather as much information as we can, so we can move forward.”

Beyond the sad reality of its ethnic geo-politics, what Nigeria needs most is good, competent leadership. That possibility abounds in every part of our country, including the Southeast. But, given Nigeria's quest for nationhood and the country's already frayed existence, the opportunity exists to kill two birds with one stone. Even more fundamental is the imperative of a new constitution that returns Nigeria to a true federal structure. Without a constitutional restructuring of Nigeria, the country has no future, as economic progress and political stability will remain elusive. Our next national political leadership selection must squarely address these related issues of national equity and constitutional reform.

Pikeville Medical Center issued a statement April 3 to update the region on efforts underway at the hospital which have resulted in changes for patients and the way the hospital delivers its services at this time.
 "PMC's priority is to ensure that patients, visitors and staff remain healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic," the statement said. "PMC is following all guidelines set by the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Gov. (Andy Beshear), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Kentucky Department for Public Health. PMC will remain open during regular business hours and offer 24 hours, seven days a week, emergency services."
 Processes to ensure safety and make appointments convenient are in place for those who are seeking non-essential and elective appointments, the statement said. According to the statement, PMC staff is calling patients notifying them of the various appointment options. Efforts are being made for those attending appointments to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and make their visit to PMC a smooth one. "While adhering to these recommendations, the lobby areas have been modified to meet social distancing guidelines," the statement said. "If patients do not want to wait in the lobby after registering, they may wait in their vehicle and receive a text when their appointment is ready to begin. Patients will then be taken directly to an exam room. In addition, PMC will also have employees designated to come to your vehicle to notify you when you are ready to be seen." In January, the statement said, PMC announced it was the recipient of a USDA Rural Health grant to implement a telehealth system in Pike County and Pikeville Independent elementary schools. The intent was to take several months to get the new system up and running. However, there was an urgent need to use the telehealth platform during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Such reactions, and the moral insouciance of Britain and France, shocked educated Africans in West Africa. The Abyssinian episode had tarnished the notion of benevolent imperialism cherished in both nations, and seemed to condone views of Africans as a primitive people, beyond the pale of humanity as well as civilisation. In the words of William Du Bois, an American black academic and champion of black rights, the Abyssinian War had shattered the black man’s ‘faith in white justice’. Harlem blacks had volunteered to fight, but had been refused visas by the American government. Du Bois believed that their instincts had been right, for in the future, ‘The only path to freedom and equality is force, and force to the uttermost.’

"Tell me one last thing," said Harry. "Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?"
 "Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?"
 That exchange from "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is one of the most iconic of J.K. Rowling's beloved books. These stories are about the power of the choices we make and the importance of fighting for the people and things we love, but sometimes, like in this case, they are also about the power of a good story.
 No matter what book you're reading, it's all happening in your head.
 But, in a way, you're also making it real. The world on the page becomes a world you build in your imagination. You have an idea of what the characters look like, how they sound. When you read, you inhabit the universe created by whatever book you hold in your hands.
 Just now, we're dealing with some Grade A Terrible Things. People are losing their loved ones. Other folks are sick. And, thankfully, the vast majority of people who are sick now are going to recover. But that doesn't make going through any of this that much easier. So many people are out of work right now. Many of us have lost the way we were living our daily lives. People can't see their families. Can't go to a movie, or out to eat. Maybe that's small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, but it's also OK and frankly healthy to be sad about that stuff.
 I've been playing Animal Crossing and reading to deal with my anxiety.
 And I can think of no better comfort books than the Harry Potter series.
 First things first, let me just say that I was extremely disappointed in J.K. Rowling's comments this past December about the transgender community. I would have thought that the person who created a world where the whole point of the story was about embracing other people for the magical beings they are would also have been more tolerant in real life. Sadly this doesn't seem to be the case. I will say that, although his creator has trans-exclusionary beliefs, I don't at all think Harry Potter would. Hateful stuff is not his style.
 Just wanted to get that off my chest, because the inherent value of my fellow human beings is not something that will ever be up for debate with me.
 OK, on to the books.
 I grew up reading this series, and it only concluded after I was an adult. It played a huge role in my formative years, and even now I think of it often. It's the kind of thing that my friends and I still debate, discuss, and enjoy together. This is of course the case for millions of people around the world.
 The books are mostly pretty long, but none longer than anything from "A Song of Ice and Fire," so I'd say most folks can handle this. It also goes by so fast that you end up finishing each book in no time.
 There are seven in all, all beginning with "Harry Potter and the," so let's skip that part: "Sorcerer's Stone," "Chamber of Secrets," "Prisoner of Azkaban," "Goblet of Fire," "Order of the Phoenix," "Half-Blood Prince" and "Deathly Hallows."
 This is the tale of a young wizard who not only learns that he is quite extraordinary indeed, but that it's going to be up to him to rid the world of the most evil wizard who ever lived, Lord Voldemort. The world-building in these stories is on par with the likes of J.R.R. Tolkien, such that Harry Potter has really become its own fandom universe. I mean, there's even a theme park.
 Each book has its corresponding movie, save the last one, which was split into two films. Not to be "That Person," but I really do recommend reading the books before you watch the films. The films are fun as their own thing, for sure, but by necessity they leave out so much of the magic that makes the books so special. Worse, some of the stuff that happens in the films, particularly the last one, fundamentally misrepresents an underlying message of the story. So I guess I'm being That Person after all. Just consider the movies their own thing and enjoy them, because they are also wonderful and the cast is just terrific. They're available on iTunes and Amazon Prime, and occasionally available on platforms like HBO or SyFy. Now and again, cable also has a Harry Potter Weekend, if you're looking for a fun movie marathon.
 Podcast-wise, there are a few great ones to check out. Binge Mode has a Harry Potter series that is a real marvel of critical textual interpretation. It's also hilarious! I've listened to their Harry Potter run several times over. There is also Harry Potter and the Sacred Text, where the hosts read the books as they would, you guessed it, a sacred text. Each episode approaches a chapter through a different lens (for example, gratitude) and I find it a fascinating exercise in examining literature as morality. Then of course there is Mugglecast! They've been around for years, they're still going strong, and I like this podcast because even after all this time, their love for these stories remains strong. Mugglecast explores various aspects of fandom, and their inclusive, nuanced takes are always appreciated by this listener.
 Whether this is your first trip to Hogwarts, or you're going back for the hundredth time, an escape to the wizarding world might be just the ticket.

“COVID-19 is transported through the air, aerosol or water droplets, and if a patient needs intubation, they have respiratory problems, the health care providers have to put a tube in so they can breathe,” Lustre-Cal director of inside sales Marty Flores said.
 “With the worldwide shortage of face masks, it just has an increased risk for the patient to release the virus out in the open,” he said. “It protects the medical providers. They’re in there all day.”
 Flores loaded two cardboard boxes containing the equipment onto a truck in front of the Lustre-Cal headquarters at 715 S. Guild Ave. Friday morning.
 He said the company’s chief executive officer, Heather Chartrand, has a friend who is a doctor in the Bay Area, and they contacted her for help in acquiring the devices.
 “We just jumped on it,” Flores said. “We jumped on getting partnerships and trying to get these things made. We’re trying to spread the word that we have these available.”
 Flores said Lustre-Cal has partnered with a couple manufactures who produce the equipment and ship them to Lodi, adding the company received as many as 15 each day.
 From here, the company then ships the airway boxes to hospitals across the country, including in the Bay Area, New York City and Rochester, N.Y.
 “We just want to help the best that we can,” he said. “It feels good that we’re able to do our small part. It’s been exhausting, but it’s not even close to the exhaustion the real workers are doing at the hospitals. Anything we can do to help.”
 Wayne Craig, president and chief executive office of the Lodi Memorial Hospital Foundation, said the airway boxes are just another much-needed amenity that have been donated from the community.

These actions against our country were motivated by several factors. First is the American political crisis, marked by the erratic handling of the pandemic in the northern country. Hundreds of thousands of people have been infected, thousands have died. Added to this mismanagement is the impact of the pandemic on the economy, one of the pillars of support for Donald Trump's administration. By intensifying the attacks against Venezuela, the US seeks to strengthen its cohesion within the core of American power, conceding to the most conservative sectors, while at the same time seeking to ingratiate itself with the mayamero (Venezuelans living in Miami) vote, with a view to the presidential elections in November of this year.

Just as Africans were taking their first, tentative steps towards nationhood and independence, Spain and Italy launched what turned out to be the last large-scale wars of conquest on the continent, in Morocco and Abyssinia. Both nations were driven by greed and historic grievances which alleged that their legitimate imperial ambitions had been frustrated or overlooked by the great powers. Jealousy and bruised pride were most strongly felt by right-wing politicians, professional soldiers, moneymen and journalists who lobbied for imperial expansion, promising that it would yield prestige and profit. In Italy, aggressive imperialism and an infatuation with the glories of the Roman Empire were central to the ideology of Mussolini’s Fascist Party which snatched power in 1922. Like Spain, Italy was a relatively poor country with limited capital reserves and industrial resources, deficiencies that were ignored or glossed over by imperial enthusiasts who argued that in the long term imperial wars would pay for themselves.
