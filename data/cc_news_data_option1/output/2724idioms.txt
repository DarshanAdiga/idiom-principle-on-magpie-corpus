 Most homeowners view wintertime as the prime season for home fires. However, in many respects, summertime is the more dangerous time of year because people are more active and doing things they should not be doing.
 Fire safety around the house has become a yearlong battle and homeowners, especially in Central Florida, should be mindful of the hazards. Many of the accidental home fires during summertime can be prevented by simply pausing, thinking, and not taking the risk. In other words, commonsense prevention.
 Here are six tips to prevent fires around the house during summertime:
 - First, be careful with gas cans. Summertime brings taller grass, weeds, shrubs, and the need to crank up lawn equipment. Most homeowners have multiple cans of fuel around their house with straight gas for mowers and treated mixed gas for four-stroke engines like weed eaters. Oftentimes, these fuels are stored in unapproved cans, which can create static electricity, causing an explosion; or, the cans are poorly capped, which can create dangerous vapors. A spark from an electrical switch, a gas water heater, or a lit cigarette can create a very bad explosion and fire. Handle gas with care and only store it in approved containers in a safe area.
 - The next hazard is how you handle the gas in the can. Believe it or not, many homeowners disrespect the volatility of gasoline and the burn units across America are filled with adults and children needlessly burned because someone did something foolish. Gasoline should never be used as an accelerant for a fire like a barbecue or trash fire. When ignited, the gasoline will explode. Many times, if you are holding the container of gas you will be immediately engulfed in flames. You should never use gasoline to start any fire or add gasoline to a fire.
 - Third, there is nothing like a big fireworks show, until it lights up your home. Fireworks in Florida are supposed to be used in agriculture, not for making huge displays. Yet, local and state governments turn their head and wink at consumers buying fireworks for celebrations. That is okay -- if it is done safely.
 There have been many homes set on fire because some pretend military man decided to shoot a high-flying firework, which landed on a nest of leaves on a house. If you must shoot fireworks off during summer celebrations, do so away from any home and be mindful of trajectories.
 - Fourth, do not ignore the smell of burning electrical wires or continuous electrical flickers and surges -- that could mean trouble. It is extremely hot in the summer, especially in the attic, walls, and outside parts of your home. During the heat of summer, air conditioners, appliances, and more people at home put exceptional demand on your home's electrical parts and pieces.
 If you are a homeowner who has ignored maintenance, or worse, takes shortcuts to patch up your electricity around the house, then you could be in danger of a summertime electrical fire. Be sure to call a licensed electrician to repair and inspect any suspected electrical issues. Also, check your fire alarms.
 - Fifth, although everyone loves grilling during the summer, a grill close to a house can start a big barbecue. An afternoon thunderstorm in Central Florida during summertime is almost a daily occurrence and there are homeowners who think bringing a grill inside their garage or under a porch is a great solution for barbecuing in the rain.
 That is a probably one of the dumbest things you can do. One inattentive moment, the grill being knocked over, or the burst of a flame upward can create a huge fire that engulfs your home in a matter of minutes. Grill away from the house, and if you are doing it in Central Florida -- buy an umbrella.
 - Finally, kids are at the house. Some children are more active than others. Some homeowners have teenagers who want to rebel and take chances. Protect your home against an unintended fire by storing and locking flammables out of the reach of children and keeping tabs on your teenagers, especially if you see matches or lighters in their possession. Help prevent a fire as well as your children getting in trouble by taking the accelerants out their hands to avert arson.
 As a homeowner, you should assume the role of Smokey the Bear and be very proactive in preventing summertime fires -- it is already hot enough around the house.

Rock Bridge defeated cross-town rival Hickman for that long-sought-after district championship. Then the Bruins kept winning. They won their sectional playoff game. They won the state quarterfinal. They won the semifinal against a perennial winner, St. Joseph's, at Mizzou Arena. Now they had 24 hours to prepare for one more.
 The state final matchup was an introduction to the next era of Missouri high school girls basketball. The changing of the guard began when Incarnate Word upset Kansas City's Hickman Mills in the semis. Incarnate would go on to win Class 5 state titles in 2010 and 2011. Then after moving to Class 4, it dominated with two championship three-peats (2013-15 and 2017-19). Meanwhile, Rock Bridge would eventually win the Class 5 state title four straight years (2012-15).
 “I just remember thinking how wild it was that we were facing two St. Louis powerhouses in the Final Four,” says Claire Schaeperkoetter, who was a senior guard that season.
 Watching Incarnate’s film that night, Nagel didn’t know how the Bruins could possibly win. She decided the best course of action would be a man-to-man defense with switches on all screens. “Sometimes as a coach you tend to look at the opponent more than yourself,” Nagel says. “That game taught me a lot about making sure that I look at our own team and not just focus on the other team. Can’t forget that we have a really good team, too.”
 The Bruins had the advantage of practicing at their own gym in Columbia the next day, before the game. Nagel prefers to run even a shoot-around with routine and structure. That day, she was coming from a meeting when she heard music blaring through the halls of Rock Bridge. The sound was coming from the gym, and it propelled her in that direction, ready to demand her players lower the volume.

PRESIDENT MNANGAGWA SAYS Zanu-PF will not cease to resist opposition or yield to unwelcome demands or planned demonstrations on 31 July which he said are meant to destabilise the Zimbabwe.   Addressing Zanu-PF members before a politburo meeting in Harare on Friday, Mnangagwa said his party has noted efforts to destabilise the education, health and security sectors.   He accused the opposition of conspiring with Zimbabwe's "detractors" to cause the "economic pain" the country is going through.   "We shall never quiver or capitulate in the face of these machinations. Zanu- PF is a revolutionary party, a party of liberation, a party with a rich ideology, a rich history and a vision for the future," said Mnangagwa.   "This character of our party is stronger than any challenge we may face no matte from what front or force."   Mnangagwa also warned workers' movements to steer clear of politics.   He said political parties should wait for the next elections to contest for power and not through demos.   "Sadly, we are seeing opposition parties clamoring for the space we occupy yet the local authorities under their purview are havens of corruption, malpractices and poor service delivery," said Mnangagwa.   He said civil society organisations should stick to their mandate or be deregistered. Mnangagwa also called for foreign embassies to stop funding projects to destabilise his government. - Byo24

Marblehead is a town full of characters but it is short one now.
 Local artist, creator of Penspeak and sometimes raconteur Marty Riskin died Thursday, July 9 at the age of 83.
 "He was an incredible character," said his son, Gregg Riskin. "You won't find many who have his unique ability to connect with people."
 Gregg Riskin said Friday he'd spent much of the day talking to people, hearing stories about his dad and trying to reconcile that man with the father he knew growing up.
 "They were very different people," he said.
 But there was a common thread. Gregg Riskin called his father an "explosively creative guy," and he was not the only one.
 A father of three sons, Noah, Seth and Gregg, Riskin made a living as a graphic artist. His wife Annette, who died in 2006, was a painter.
 Gregg Riskin said he still has a sketch book of his father's that dates back to the 40's, when Marty was seven or eight years old. It contains drawings of cowboys and Indians "and you could see early on his incredible understanding of anatomy."
 Marty seemed inherently understand how things should look and he could channel what was in him mind or his memory to the page.
 "It was an incredible gift he had," Gregg said.
 Second Act
 When the computer came along setting the graphic art's world into a tailspin, Marty was left behind, Gregg said.
 "It turned him into a prehistoric relic … he did not adapt," he said.
 While it caused some hard time for Riskin it also lead to his second act as an editorial cartoonist and illustrator.
 "He really went out and reinvented himself as a cartoonist, which was really his love," Gregg said.
 Riskin's work graced the pages of the Marblehead Reporter and dozens of other papers for decades. Former Reporter editor Kris Olson called him a rare and precious gift to all the newspapers that benefited from his talent and to the communities they served.
 "That's not to say he didn't give me heartburn on occasion," Olson admitted. "But on the rare occasion I suggested he might be pushing the envelope a little too far, he'd maybe mount a small protest but inevitably head back to the drawing board."
 Olson called Riskin a mischief maker in the best possible way.
 "In hindsight, I probably should have let him get us into more 'good trouble,'" he said.
 As newspapers' resources have been scaled back, too often editorial cartoons have been one of the casualties, Olson noted.
 "That speaks on some level to a tragic underappreciation of the value of the editorial cartoonist, he said. "If a picture is worth a thousand words, a pointed cartoon can be worth a million."
 Olson said one of his favorite annual contributions Marty would make to the Reporter was the elaborate illustrations that would wrap around the text of a poem Fraffie Welch and George Derringer would create around the holidays.
 "I venture to say it was a newspaper tradition unlike any other in the country or the world," he said.
 Perhaps Riskin's most memorable cartoon was drawn in the hours immediately after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The image depicts the Statue of Liberty, head bowed, "as if she'd just taken a blow to the stomach," as Riskin was known to describe it.
 The positive reaction to the cartoon was immediate and prompted the Reporter's parent company to offer reprints in exchange for a donation of $5 or more to the Red Cross' relief efforts. Before long, nearly $12,000 had been collected. With his bosses' endorsement, Riskin also submitted the drawing for Pulitzer Prize consideration.
 And then some
 But editorial cartoons and illustrations weren't Riskin's only talents.
 "He was a pretty damn good fine artist," said his friend and companion Bette Keva.
 Keva met Riskin in 2005 but only in passing. Two years ago they reconnected and before long the pair, at Riskin's urging, launched a column, Pickles in the Mist. He drew, she wrote.
 "I doubted I could do it," said the long time journalist. "He steadily said he had no qualms … I'm very grateful we had that time together."
 Funny, clever, irreverent, cranky and stubborn was how Keva described her friend, "he had the spirit of a young guy, he was always ready to do anything, he was very adventurous and always creating and it's one of the things I absolutely loved about him."
 Keva said Riskin was working on a project right up until COVID-19 hit in March putting the brakes on world.
 "He had a ton of interests," she said. "And he was just a really interesting guy."
 Gregg Riskin said a memorial of some kind is still in the works for his father.
 "He was not a funeral guy," he said. "He did not want the traditional thing and we're not going to give him one so we're figuring it out."
