“The costs to cover Medicaid expansion will come directly off the top of the budget without any regard to available funds and the Legislature will have absolutely no discretion over this spending,” said Ryan Johnson, a senior adviser to United for Missouri, in a statement. “The proponents mention cost savings, but the department that operates the state Medicaid program on a day- to-day basis says it will cost state taxpayers at least $200 million. If the worst-case scenario plays out and the federal money goes away, Missouri taxpayers will be left behind to forever cover the entire annual bill of $2 Billion. This is wrong.”
 Americans for Prosperity-Missouri also said the ballot initiative violates constitutional requirements because the initiative would require appropriating money to fund the proposal.
 “This mandate will divert critical funds from our children’s education or force the state to increase taxes,” said Jeremy Cady, state director for the American for Prosperity-Missouri, in a statement. “At a time when our state is already in dire economic straits, we should not tie the hands of the Legislature with this unconstitutional ballot initiative.”
 But Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green ruled on June 2 that the ballot measure doesn’t require lawmakers to set aside state revenue for the expansion. That means the measure will stay on the ballot. Both critics of the proposal say they will appeal.
 Support for Amendment 2
 Proponents believe Medicaid expansion would save the state money in the long run. Donna Harlan, of Joplin, attended the campaign stop Tuesday in the parking lot of the Community Clinic of Southwest Missouri in Joplin to pick up yard signs. Harlan said she’s been working with the coalition for some time in order to get Medicaid expansion on the ballot.
 “People are in a gap,” she said. “Even with minimum wage, in order to even live, you make more than it takes to get on Medicaid, but quite often, you don’t make enough money to get ACA. There’s a big gap in health coverage. Particularly with COVID-19, it’s essential we get people the help that they need. We’ve been working on this for quite a while.”
 The Missouri Chamber of Commerce, one of Missouri’s most influential business groups, announced support for Amendment 2. President and CEO Daniel Mehan cited a study that suggests expanding eligibility for the government health care program would create more than 16,300 jobs annually in the first four years of the program. The study was done by Massachusetts-based economic analytics firm Regional Economic Models Inc. and commissioned by the Missouri Foundation for Health.
 The chamber’s support is significant because the organization plays a major role in Missouri politics and has particular sway among Republican elected officials, many of whom — including Gov. Mike Parson — oppose Medicaid expansion.

Charges filed against U.S. Congressman Steve Watkins Tuesday evening by Shawnee County District Attorney Mike Kagay took center stage during the first and only 2nd District Congressional debate.
   
 Watkins maintained his innocence regarding the charges and called them hyperpolitical and very suspicious. Kagay announced the charges shortly before the debate took place at 6:30 p.m. on KSNT.
   
 "I haven't done anything wrong," Watkins said. "As soon as I realized that I had put my mailing address instead of my physical address, we fixed it. This is very suspicious, seems highly political (and) we've cooperated with the district attorney completely."
   
 Watkins has been charged with three felonies including voting without being qualified, unlawful advance voting and interference with law enforcement involving false information. He also faces a misdemeanor charge of failing to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles of a change of address.
   
 The charges are linked to the November 2019 election.
   
 Watkins said he hasn't seen the charges, but looks forward to clearing his name.
   
 Jake LaTurner, who is one of three Republican candidates running for the second district seat, said the newly announced charges make it clear the race is now between Dennis Taylor and himself.
   
 "Three weeks from now, republican voters across the second congressional district are going to have to pick the very best candidate to go against the mayor of Topeka Michelle De La Isla," LaTurner said. "She is well-funded, she is a candidate supported by Nancy Pelosi and we need to put our best foot forward. Clearly, our current congressman with three felony charges and a misdemeanor charge is not the person to do that."
   
 LaTurner called for Watkins to take responsibility for his actions, "own up to it and deal with the legal issues heading his way."
   
 The 30-minute debate, which was moderated by political scientist Bob Beatty, covered several topics including border security, the COVID-19 pandemic and issues related to racial tensions and law enforcement.
   
 Beatty asked candidates how they think a surge in COVID-19 cases nationwide should be handled and if they agree with Kansas Senator Jerry Moran who recently said the country was not well-prepared and flat-flooted.
   
 Watkins praised President Donald Trump on his efforts to curtail the coronavirus and said he has taken decisive actions.
   
 "We've never had a spike that exceeded our medical capabilities in any particular geography," Watkins said. "It's gonna be tough. Now is a horrible time for partisanship. We need to stick together and see this through."
   
 Taylor agreed with Moran's statement saying that the country hasn't done what is needed since learning about the seriousness of COVID-19.
   
 "What happens in Florida and Texas and Arizona I am afraid is coming here unless we do testing," Taylor said. "We should be doing 20 million tests a day. We are doing about 650,000 on average."
   
 When asked whether or not everyone should be required to wear masks given the rise in new COVID-19 cases, Watkins voiced his disapproval for statewide mask mandates.
   
 "I wear a mask to slow the spread, I wear a mask often," Watkins said. "When I'm flying I wear a mask. That's my choice and it's (an) individual's choice to balance that with the risk."
   
 The debate topic turned toward race relations and policing at the end as Beatty asked the candidates if major police reform is needed in the United States.
   
 "The tragic shooting of George Floyd was a tragedy and the violent response to it has been a tragedy," LaTurner said. "There is a bad apple or two in every single profession under the sun including the police and where those bad apples are found we need to take care of it swiftly. But we cannot allow a bad apple or two to define an entire profession."
   
 Watkins said he has been in communication with law enforcement officials and talked with them about important issues including qualified immunity, no-knock warrants, cameras, collective bargaining and funding.
   
 "We've got a political party that wants to decrease the funding of police as crime is on the rise in our big cities," Watkins said. "So it's time to come together and realize that 99.9 percent of the law enforcement professionals are fantastic individuals. I support them completely and when it comes to African Americans, I ask that they look at what Donald Trump has delivered -- the lowest unemployment rates, opportunity zones, criminal justice reform and home ownership's on the rise. Results matter, tag lines don't."
   
 Taylor, who noted he has police officers and people of color within his family, said he feels the country is on the cusp of needing to decide whether or not law enforcement is being asked to take on tasks that are beyond their expertise.
   
 "We need to decide that as a community and as a country," Taylor said. "We need to be looking at this and this is the time to be checking out whether we really want chokeholds, whether we really want qualified immunity."

I never made it all the way through Jerzy Kosinski's bleak and brooding 1965 novel "The Painted Bird." By the time I tried, it had won the National Book Award, and was being recommended to me by friends who read all of the "important" books of the day. I put it down - and never picked it up again - right after a scene in which a drunk old man attacked a younger man who he believed was staring at his wife, dug the victim's eyes out with a spoon, then tossed them on the floor.      Yes, the scene is in the bleak and brooding, yet haunting and hypnotic, and gorgeously photographed black and white movie. But the appalling deed is staged in a manner that can be watched without revulsion, though we do get to see the eyeballs on the floor.      No, this is not a psychological horror film in which a supernatural demon possesses people and makes them commit grisly acts. Rather, it's a psychological horror film about survival and resiliency in the midst of inconceivable and very real horror.      Set in the latter stages of WWII in some unnamed Eastern European country, it presents the wrong place-wrong time somewhat picaresque story of a young boy (first-time actor Petr Kotlar) whose apparently once-normal life has been turned upside down. He's a wanderer on a devastated landscape, trying to "get home," wherever that may be and to whoever may be there.      The film is cut up into chapters, each titled with a reference to a person or people that our innocent, sad, lonely protagonist - who looks to be about 8 years old - eventually meets up with. He hardly speaks (just a few words here and there), no one calls him by name (it's revealed near the end), and the reason that he's alone in the world isn't made clear (though that, too, is disclosed near the end).      He's living in a small farmhouse with his stern Aunt Marta, doing chores, being assured that he'll "only be here for a while," and making wishful drawings of him with his parents. Marta wasn't kidding about his time there, as she dies shortly afterward, and he sets off down the road, his journey about to begin.      The Czech director Vaclav Marhoul, who also adapted the Kosinski novel, keeps the focus on human suffering - some of it emotional, some of it physical - and though it's a mostly somber and grueling experience to sit through, Marhoul's continual use of closeups on the beatific face of the boy somehow humanizes the film.      That proves to be quite an achievement with so much direness, especially in the actions of other people, going on around him. The boy's visit to the first of many villages along the road results in the locals believing he's an evil spirit. After being driven away, he's taken in by an old miller, his younger wife and a mill worker. You've already been warned about the eyeball scene. He's soon on the road again, living with and working for a man who catches wild songbirds and sells them, and who is regularly visited by a young woman who gets pleasure out of giving the man pleasure.      But wherever the boy lands, things go very wrong, for him and for others, and he is always right at the center, suffering and seeing others suffer. The journey continues, and he can do nothing but take it all in, rarely understanding what's happening. WWII rears its ugly head in attacks involving Germans, Russians, Cossacks and villagers who have gotten in their way. An appalling sequence features Jewish prisoners breaking out of a moving train, only to be mowed down by Nazi soldiers. The boy is there, a witness to the aftermath and later, at another locale, becoming a victim of depravity.      Part of the film's overwhelming strength is its detachment from some of these events, achieved by using very little dialogue and by filling the screen with unknown faces. A slight drawback is the recognizable cameos by Udo Kier, Harvey Keitel, Julian Sands, Stellan Skarsgard, and Barry Pepper that briefly pull you out of the film's grip.      Fortunately, everything keeps returning to the boy and his practically expressionless face and thoughts of how much more of this he can take. Remarkably, the film has an ending that achieves a degree of peace amidst the constant turmoil in the almost three hours that precede it.      "The Painted Bird" premieres on VOD and streaming services on July 17.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

Phil Spencer and Microsoft have a clear vision for the future of the video game industry, and it's quite a bit different from the one envisioned by Sony. In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz, the Xbox boss discussed the major difference between the two companies heading into the next console generation. While the PlayStation brand seems to be focusing solely ahead, the Xbox brand is still very much entrenched in the present, with plans to continue supporting the Xbox One in addition to the Xbox Series X thanks to cross-gen support. It's a radical approach to a new console generation, but Spencer seems to view it as something that will benefit the video game community as a whole.
 "Gaming is about entertainment and community and diversion and learning new stories and new perspectives, and I find it completely counter to what gaming is about to say that part of that is to lock people away from being able to experience those games. Or to force someone to buy my device on the day that I want them to go buy it, in order to partake in what gaming is about," Spencer said to GamesIndustry.biz.
 It will be interesting to see how this approach works out. On one hand, those that can't buy a new console within the first year often see their software options dry up quickly. On the other hand, however, Microsoft can only expect developers to continue supporting outdated hardware for so long. While this could lead to a larger potential audience for a game, as more gamers eventually do upgrade their consoles, Microsoft's model could become unsustainable. With the company reportedly encouraging publishers to avoid charging for next-gen upgrades, it's hard to imagine how long Microsoft can expect developers to support the Xbox One and Xbox Series X at the same time.
 As far as the next generation of consoles goes, it's clear that Spencer and Microsoft are focused on expanding the Xbox audience and rewarding those that have stuck with the brand. From cross-gen support to backwards compatibility, it's clear that Microsoft has a much different goal moving forward than Sony does. It's impossible to say whether or not it will work out in the long run, but it's certainly an ambitious goal.
 What do you think of Microsoft's approach to cross-gen support? Do you think it will be a sustainable model? Let us know in the comments or share your thoughts directly on Twitter at @Marcdachamp to talk all things gaming!

As many of my Loyal Reader(s) know, the “#1 Hits of the 60s” show at the Clay Cooper Theatre has been, and continues to be one of my personal favorites here in Branson. Not only has the husband and wife team of Amber Campbell and Matt Muhoberac, who also own and produce the show, taken their production to awesome heights over the past two decades, last season they took home “Show of the Year” at the Branson Terry Music Awards, which was a well deserved honor.
 This good time show features some of the best music from some of the most iconic artists of the era that defined rock ‘n’ roll, while also serving as a time capsule for one of the most important and tumultuous decades ever. From “girl groups” to doo wop, bubble gum to the British Invasion and everything between, “#1 Hits of the 60s” has it covered.
 Also, this production has one of my favorite veteran’s tributes anywhere. The songs, presentation, lighting, video and most importantly, the crowd reaction, are pitch-perfect and truly tough to beat.
 While it’s obvious they care about the content, message and execution of the show, it’s all for naught without a talented cast. Lucky for them (and us), they have uber-talented entertainers in spades as Kelly Parrish, Kaylee Riggins, Stephani Powers Haygood, Jordan Dickison, Michael Jason Frost and Eric Dalton headline the production.
 Even though they’re all talented individuals, the fact they’re forced to tackle so many different artists and tunes is quite the daunting task, but they’re all up the challenge.
 Then, consider while they’re trying to cover more than 100 tunes, they’re also dancing their hearts out in nearly every single number, and what they do becomes that much more impressive.
 While I’m not aware of a scientific formula available to prove this statement, I’d be willing to bet this is the “hardest working cast” in Branson, and that’s saying something.
 I would be remiss if I didn’t give a shout out to the Hit Men Band, consisting of Muhoberac on keys, guitarist Josh Carroll, Bass Player of the Year “Big” Mike Williamson, saxophone specialist Ryan Dunn and my man Dino Phillips on drums. These guys flat-out nail every single tune they play, and it’s difficult to imagine this show without them.
 Add in stellar lights and sound thanks to Troy Coin and Chris Jones, as well as an excellent venue experience at the Clay Cooper Theatre, and you’ve got an afternoon experience that is extremely tough to beat.
 Showtimes are 2 p.m. Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.

The Scholar Bowl teams from College Heights and Thomas Jefferson will be moved up.
 "Our Scholars Bowl team is going to be a Class 3 team," Jordan said. "We won a state championship in Scholars Bowl in 2019, been to the final four several years in a row. Add those up over the last six years, we're moving up to Class 3, and we might be there for a little while."
 The championship factor is not only sport specific but also gender specific.
 "Your boys basketball and girls basketball can be different classifications, depending on the success of one of those teams," Jordan said. "You could be sending the girls basketball team to a Class 2 or 3 location for the district tournament and your boys team be Class 1 or Class 2. It's different for sure."
 "From a transportation standpoint, it can create some challenges if the boys are getting shipped to Springfield and the girls team is playing in Nevada," Myers said. "And our fan base is relatively small due to our school's population ... it could have a negative impact also."
 According to Jason West, MSHSAA communications director, talk about this change surfaced about three years ago.
 "There was some momentum stirring again ... we had a school petition for a separate state championship for private schools, nonpublic schools," West said. "That didn't succeed, but it was still in everybody's head.
 "During discussions, some of the private schools administrators on the ad hoc committee for classifications proposed the idea of instead of the multiplier, what if we had something based on how well the team did in the postseason. That gained momentum, and they thought that might be something the entire membership may feel comfortable with."
 The change could punish future teams.
 "Greenwood obviously has a phenomenal basketball program right now," Myers said. "It's going to take six years for that to come off, so that's going to affect future athletes, and they may not be at that same level. It definitely has the potential to have a negative impact on future teams.
 "There definitely will be some challenges involved, something we as schools are going to have to figure out the best way to make it work and do the best thing that we can for the kids. At the end of the day, that's what are jobs are, to try to create the best opportunity and the most opportunities for our student-athletes."

 Delaware State Police arrested a Millsboro woman after a traffic stop led to the discovery of drugs.
 The incident occurred just before 7 a.m. on Thursday, July 12, when a motorist called in to report an aggressive driver. According to the caller, a blue Hyundai Veloster was eastbound on John J. Williams Highway (Route 24), east of Camp Arrowhead Road, traveling over the double yellow line multiple times and passing cars in a no passing zone.
 A trooper spotted the vehicle and a traffic stop was initiated on Old Landing Road. The driver, 28-year-old Kelsey Marks, appeared to be under the influence. A DUI investigation ensued and led to the discovery of five 12-milligram buprenorphine tabs and drug paraphernalia.
 Marks was taken into custody without incident and charged with possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, driving a vehicle under the influence of a drug and traffic offenses. She was later released on $1,050 unsecured bond.

The clock is ticking towards the release of _Marvel's Avengers_ , and Marvel Comics fans are super excited to see what the highly-anticipated video game has in store. The title will allow fans to embody some of their favorite superhero characters, while also incorporating some RPG systems into their playstyle. While we'll probably have to wait until _Marvel's Avengers_ is released to see exactly what that all entails, it sounds like one awesome combination between two of the game's characters is a possibility. While speaking to ComicBook.com last month, studio head Scot Amos cited one particular build that came up in his gameplay, which allowed Iron Man's technology to be combined with Ant-Man's Pym Particles.
 "One weekend, I found this particular build between these pieces of gear for Iron Man that had some Pym oscillators in them," Amos revealed. "So my lasers, when you're actually in spring flight and you have your lasers out, were actually targeting various enemies, but they have Pym Particles on them. Then I'm flying through the middle of a channel of a big combat. And I am just shrinking things left and right. And you're seeing these giant mechs shrink into these tiny little toys, and then my AI team, and my Hulk is over there and beats the crap out of them, Thor shows up and lightnings them, and it's like this amazing fun for me."
 While it sounds like this combination had to be slightly depowered, the idea of getting to use Iron Man technology to shrink technology around you is certainly a fun possibility. With a roster of characters that also includes Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, Captain America, and Ms. Marvel, it will be interesting to see what other combinations the game has in store.
 Here's the official description for _Marvel's Avengers_ :
 " _Marvel 's Avengers_ combines an original story with single-player and co- operative gameplay in the definitive Avengers gaming experience. Assemble into teams of up to four players online, master extraordinary abilities, customize a growing roster of Heroes, and defend the Earth from escalating threats. Featuring regular content updates, _Marvel's Avengers_ will take players on an epic journey delivered over multiple years. This game is what's next for the Avengers."

Rebuilding the two bridges over the Cape Cod canal? Sure.
 Rebuilding the foundation of policing in Massachusetts? Not as easy.
 The Baker administration and the Army Corps of Engineers reached an agreement last week that will see the federal agency assume the responsibility of replacing the two aging bridges that connect Cape Cod with the rest of Massachusetts.
 After the years-long construction project at a cost of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion to the Corps is complete, the state will assume ownership and control of the Bourne and Sagamore spans, hoping they'll last another 85 years.
 "It's a new chapter in Cape Cod's history," U.S. Rep. William Keating said, giving his enthusiastic endorsement of the arrangement.
 Writing the new script for how police should behave and be held accountable for that behavior proved to be a more daunting task. The week began with high hopes for supporters anxious to solidify a response to the police violence that led to weeks of street demonstrations, but it ended in frustration.
 Senate President Karen Spilka, Sen. Sonia-Chang Diaz and Sen. William Brownsberger on Monday rolled out an expansive effort that would license law enforcement officers at all levels of government and ban the use of tactics like chokeholds that have come under scrutiny since the killing of George Floyd.
 But the 73-page bill also would do much more. So much more. And the wide- ranging set of ideas for how to improve policing in Massachusetts, including new limits on qualified immunity from civil suits, didn't stop senators from filing 145 amendments before the debate was supposed to start on Thursday.
 For Sen. Ryan Fattman, enough was enough. The Sutton Republican laid the bill on the table Thursday afternoon, and put a hold on it again Friday, setting up a rare Saturday session when he may simply elect to delay again.
 "We all want to get to yes. We're just not there yet. It's not ready for prime time. Hopefully we get there," Fattman said. And he wasn't alone.
 Sen. John Keenan, a Quincy Democrat, came to Fattman's defense, demonstrating that it wasn't just the Republicans suggesting senators deserved more time to review such a consequential bill.
 This type of holdup seemed to be exactly what Rep. Carlos Gonzalez had in mind when he wrote to Spilka, House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Gov. Charlie Baker earlier in the week and asked them not to let the pressure to bulk up the police bill jeopardize the five or six core reforms sought by the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus.
 Gov. Baker agreed with Gonzalez, who chairs the MBLLC, writing back that he thought this was a "rare opportunity to act quickly and concisely" to create a structure to license police across Massachusetts and hold them to a set of standards.
 While that still may be possible, the chance to do it quickly and concisely may be gone. And with the House yet to write its own bill, the July 31 deadline to get Baker something he can sign seems awfully close.
 Secretary of State William Galvin, however, demonstrated this week how even after the Legislature passes a bill and the governor signs it into law, there can still be holdups.
 Baker signed a major expansion of voting-by-mail for the late summer and fall elections, but now there's a question about whether Galvin, the state's chief elections officer, will be able to comply with the new law.
 Galvin said he doesn't have the money to mail the applications for mail-in ballots to the more than 4.5 million registered voters, and the Legislature hasn't authorized any money for him to spend. The applications are supposed to be in the mail by next Wednesday, but the secretary disagrees with voting rights advocates who believe the $8.2 million in CARES Act funding received by the state for voting expenses can be used to mail the applications.
 Galvin believes there's a difference between mailing actual ballots, and mailing an application for a ballot. Enter U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, who jumped in with an "urgent request" seeking clarity from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission over whether CARES Act funds can be used for the postage on ballot applications.
 In the meantime, Galvin has made the application available for download on his website.
 Speaking of differences of opinion, Sen. Joseph Boncore said out loud on Friday what had been becoming clearer for several weeks -- the Senate will not be taking up a transportation revenue bill this session.
 The Senate is finally moving forward with a $17 billion, multi-year borrowing bill for infrastructure improvements, but new taxes and fees approved by the House in March have been put on ice in the upper chamber.
 The relationship between the House and Senate is probably colder than that between Gov. Baker and Gov. Janet Mills of Maine, but those two are also at odds over whether Massachusetts has contained the coronavirus, or is merely keeping its head above water.
 After Mills kept Massachusetts residents on her list of vacationers who must still quarantine if they travel north to her waterfront state, Baker said he had a little chat with the governor: "I basically said, 'I'll put my data in Massachusetts up against your data any day.'"
 In the wonkish world where Baker thrives, those sound like fighting words.
 But does Mills have reason to worry about a second wave? Massachusetts is now the only New England state with a COVID-19 transmission rate that indicates rapid spread of the coronavirus is possible, according to the website Rt.live, which has been tracking state-level transmission trends.
 And hotspots persist.
 Baker this week launched a new testing initiative that will open standalone and mobile testing sites in eight communities where the numbers of new cases, positive testing rates, and volume of testing worryingly trail the statewide averages.
 Resident of Chelsea, Everett, Fall River, Lawrence, Lowell, Lynn, Marlborough, and New Bedford are being encouraged to take advantage of the free testing, even if they are asymptomatic.
 Baker concluded that Massachusetts residents don't need Maine anyway. There are plenty of nice spots in the Bay State to vacation for the summer, he said. That is if it's safe to go outside at all.
 Between the sharks circling the waters off the Cape and the coronavirus in the air, people certainly did need another reason to worry about leaving the house. But they got one.
 Eastern equine encephalitis and West Nile virus are both back and public health officials are cautioning people - in the middle of a streak of oppressive humidity - to keep their skin covered after dusk.
 "The key to our message is about taking personal protective measures," Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel said.
 She was talking about protection against mosquito bites, but it's applicable to all present circumstances.

I never made it all the way through Jerzy Kosinski's bleak and brooding 1965 novel "The Painted Bird." By the time I tried, it had won the National Book Award, and was being recommended to me by friends who read all of the "important" books of the day. I put it down - and never picked it up again - right after a scene in which a drunk old man attacked a younger man who he believed was staring at his wife, dug the victim's eyes out with a spoon, then tossed them on the floor.
 Yes, the scene is in the bleak and brooding, yet haunting and hypnotic, and gorgeously photographed black and white movie. But the appalling deed is staged in a manner that can be watched without revulsion, though we do get to see the eyeballs on the floor.
 No, this is not a psychological horror film in which a supernatural demon possesses people and makes them commit grisly acts. Rather, it's a psychological horror film about survival and resiliency in the midst of inconceivable and very real horror.
 Set in the latter stages of WWII in some unnamed Eastern European country, it presents the wrong place-wrong time somewhat picaresque story of a young boy (first-time actor Petr Kotlar) whose apparently once-normal life has been turned upside down. He's a wanderer on a devastated landscape, trying to "get home," wherever that may be and to whoever may be there.
 The film is cut up into chapters, each titled with a reference to a person or people that our innocent, sad, lonely protagonist - who looks to be about 8 years old - eventually meets up with. He hardly speaks (just a few words here and there), no one calls him by name (it's revealed near the end), and the reason that he's alone in the world isn't made clear (though that, too, is disclosed near the end).
 He's living in a small farmhouse with his stern Aunt Marta, doing chores, being assured that he'll "only be here for a while," and making wishful drawings of him with his parents. Marta wasn't kidding about his time there, as she dies shortly afterward, and he sets off down the road, his journey about to begin.
 The Czech director Vaclav Marhoul, who also adapted the Kosinski novel, keeps the focus on human suffering - some of it emotional, some of it physical - and though it's a mostly somber and grueling experience to sit through, Marhoul's continual use of closeups on the beatific face of the boy somehow humanizes the film.
 That proves to be quite an achievement with so much direness, especially in the actions of other people, going on around him. The boy's visit to the first of many villages along the road results in the locals believing he's an evil spirit. After being driven away, he's taken in by an old miller, his younger wife, and a mill worker. You've already been warned about the eyeball scene. He's soon on the road again, living with and working for a man who catches wild songbirds and sells them, and who is regularly visited by a young woman who gets pleasure out of giving the man pleasure.
 But wherever the boy lands, things go very wrong, for him and for others, and he is always right at the center, suffering and seeing others suffer. The journey continues, and he can do nothing but take it all in, rarely understanding what's happening. WWII rears its ugly head in attacks involving Germans, Russians, Cossacks, and villagers who have gotten in their way. An appalling sequence features Jewish prisoners breaking out of a moving train, only to be mowed down by Nazi soldiers. The boy is there, a witness to the aftermath and later, at another locale, becoming a victim of depravity.
 Part of the film's overwhelming strength is its detachment from some of these events, achieved by using very little dialogue and by filling the screen with unknown faces. A slight drawback is the recognizable cameos by Udo Kier, Harvey Keitel, Julian Sands, Stellan Skarsgard and Barry Pepper that briefly pull you out of the film's grip.
 Fortunately, everything keeps returning to the boy and his practically expressionless face and thoughts of how much more of this he can take. Remarkably, the film has an ending that achieves a degree of peace amidst the constant turmoil in the almost three hours that precede it.
 "The Painted Bird" premieres on VOD and streaming services on July 17.

“The ambulance was donated to us, and we were able to get it wrapped in all of our messaging," said K.J. McDonald, field director with Healthcare for Missouri. "It’s kind of like a driving billboard. We’ve been taking it all over the state across the last couple of months.”
 The Missouri Hospital Association, the Missouri Nurses Association, the Missouri Primary Care Association, Freeman Health System and Mercy Hospital Joplin have also cited support for the expansion. Medicaid expansion supporters say it will help keep rural hospitals open, which are having to foot the bill when people without insurance are unable to pay for emergency care.
 “It will strengthen our hospitals, add jobs to our economy and save our state budget money in the long run by covering more people,” McDonald said. “It’s fiscally responsible and morally the right thing to do. We’ve seen 10 rural hospitals close since 2014, and many of those hospital administrators have said that Medicaid expansion would’ve likely saved their hospitals from closing.”
 Its passage would save the state up to $1 billion annually by 2026, according to the office of Democratic Auditor Nicole Galloway, who is a candidate for governor. A fiscal impact study conducted by Washington University also supports expansion.

Though the AFL has a long-standing agreement with the MCG, who holds hosting rights to the Grand Final until 2037, the broad consensus is that a Grand Final played in an empty stadium will suck ass. And so for the first time in league history, the biggest game of the year appears all-but certain to be on the move.


  While last week Sydney’s ANZ Stadium was the clear frontrunner for the game, the upswing in coronavirus cases in NSW has just about ruled that out completely, leaving the door wide open.


  Brisbane and the Gabba seems to be the likely frontrunner now, given the presence of the Victorian teams, the favourable timezone, and the proximity to east coast corporate dollars. The potential to play the game in front of a capacity crowd of 42,000 also stands in Queensland’s favour.


  However this is likely to face strident opposition from both Adelaide Oval and Optus Stadium in Perth, both of which are glittering arenas that lack the Slowly Crumbling Into Dust aesthetic that the Gabba has in spades.


  No matter what, it appears all-but certain that an AFL Grand Final will take place outside of Victoria for the very first time this year. And that alone is quite the thing indeed.
