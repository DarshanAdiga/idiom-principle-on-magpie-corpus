The Tags are attached to a key chain and then placed on a briefcase, a bicycle, a dog collar, and more. In conjunction with the Find My app and the U1 ultra-wideband, or UWB chip placed inside the iPhone 11 series, lost items that have an AirTag attached can be found by an iPhone owner. If the product is indeed introduced during the October 13th event, Apple will no doubt include a video to show how it works. The chip sends out short distance radio waves using a Time-of-Flight system. These waves bounce off of a subject and return to the phone allowing it to provide the user with very accurate directions to help find the missing tag and the item it is connected to.  
   
 Leaked code discovered last year included directions to an iPhone user using AirTags to find a missing item. The string of code said, "Walk around several feet and move your iPhone up and down until a balloon comes into view." Previously leaked images showed a 3D red balloon and a 2D orange balloon that will apparently surface on an iPhone screen. when an AirTags user moves closer to a tagged item. The tag, which reportedly is equipped with replaceable batteries, can have a feature called "Lost mode" enabled. This setting allows the iPhone user who found the tag (and the item it is connected to) to retrieve contact information for the owner of the discovered tag so that he can get contact the owner and arrange to send him his property back.
   
 A video that Apple inadvertently left up on the internet for a brief period of time this year showed that users will be able to search for AirTags even when offline. A feature named Offline Finding can be toggled on to help an iPhone and AirTags to be found when not connected to Wi-Fi or Cellular.
   
 So besides the four 5G enabled iPhone 12 models that we expect to see Apple unwrap next Tuesday (starting at 1 pm ET/10 am PT), Apple itself appears to be telling us to be prepared for the introduction of its new tracking system.
   
 Apple still has some new products that will probably not be introduced until next year including the AirPods 3\. A less ambitious version of the AirPower wireless charging pad designed for the iPhone 12 line might also be announced this coming Tuesday. If not, the accessory could become official sometime early next year.

After that, we know that he moved to the hospital, right? So, that's not to say that that didn't work. It's just to say that he was sick. And he went into the hospital and got the remdesivir.

But it hasn't shown to change whether or not somebody lives or dies.

Yes. Any proposal that calls for rolling back the Trump tax cuts and raising taxes is a bad idea, especially right now. It goes against the grain of tax policy 101.
 When you tax something, you get less of it. Raising taxes on businesses would damage our economic recovery and put the brakes on job creation, startups, and wage growth. Raising taxes on American businesses ignores the progress we made to target abuse in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Let’s not forget under the Obama-Biden administration, U.S. tax laws allowed companies to defer their foreign earnings unless and until they were brought back to the United States. As a senior member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, I targeted this offshore loophole. We enacted a minimum tax on what’s known as global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). I also worked to prevent abusive use of deductions made to foreign affiliates and imposed limits on the deductibility of interest.
 Our changes to the tax law cracked down on these abuses, expanded the tax base, encouraged on-shore investment and grew the economy. Unraveling these reforms would propel U.S. companies to shift and shelter profits overseas. That’s bad for American jobs and deprives revenue from our military, public health programs, and public services. Raising taxes on U.S. businesses fails to understand how our global supply chains work.
 During my county meetings in Iowa, I heard from manufacturers who’re struggling from disruptions due to the pandemic. For example, slapping on a 10 percent penalty on goods and services imported by U.S. companies from foreign affiliates would boomerang into a foreign tax on U.S. goods and services exported from America. As the adage goes, the only certainties in life are death and taxes. Increasing taxes now would sound the death knell to the employment gains and surge in economic opportunity among communities of color unleashed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
 According to the Joint Committee on Taxation and Congressional Budget Office, at least one-quarter of the corporate tax is borne by the workforce. So, raising taxes on businesses means they would be shouldered by working men and women across the country through fewer jobs, reduced wages, and less benefits. Policymakers who glibly say wealthy Americans and big corporations must pay their “fair share” are misleading or ignoring how tax laws work.
 Even President Obama understood the risk of raising taxes during an economic recovery, “The last thing you want to do is raise taxes in the middle of a recession.”
 As far as I’m concerned, that is doubly true as America navigates a post- pandemic recovery.

In the 2016 election, 63 percent of women registered to vote cast ballots, compared with 59 percent of men; women cast nearly 10 million more ballots than men. Voter turnout in 2020 is projected to witness a 12 percent increase over 2016’s election.
 Fifty-six percent of women are registered Democrats, while just 38 percent of females are Republican. Across the board, women, whether they are college- educated, attended college, a high school graduate, or have less than a high school education prefer the Democratic Party.
 Oma Seddiq, columnist for Business Insider, reveals in her August 18 op-ed the 100-year fight for political equality is far from over, and three facts are prevalent: women are more politically engaged, women of color are the fastest- growing voting bloc, and women have shifted from GOP to Democrat since the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.
 American University professor Jane Hall concurs with Seddiq and notes, “We are seeing a very striking acceleration of what has been a trend for some time, which is a gender gap between women voting for Democrats and men voting more for the Republican Party.”

 # Eagles open home schedule against Sacred Heart
 Daniel Green
 BWS Sports
 The Rosepine Eagles opened the season in fine fashion with a convincing win at East Beauregard last week.
 The Eagles (1-0) aim to keep that going on at 7 p.m. Thursday night as they host the Sacred Heart Trojans of Ville Platte at McKee-McCain Stadium.
 Sacred Heart enters the game at 1-0 as well, having beaten Basile by a score of 28-0.
 According to Rosepine head coach Brad Ducote, the Trojans are a very good team and is expecting a competitive contest.
 "They've gone to the spread look and utilize the skill they have," he said. "Their quarterback throws the ball well and both he and the running back are threats every time they touch the ball. Defensively, they are strong across the board. It should be a really good matchup."
 In last week's win over East Beauregard, the Rosepine running game flexed its muscles behind Grant Ducote, who had 179 yards and four touchdowns. Additionally, the Eagles had some balance with Ethan Frey throwing for over 170 yards. His favorite target was Cole Donahue, who reeled in four passes for 119 yards.
 "We were kind of worried about our running game, but our line did a great job," Coach Ducote said. "Frey threw the ball really well and Donahue might have the best hands on the team."
 Ducote was very pleased with last week's effort and was happy to return to the field.
 "I was super proud of our kids and it certainly was good to have that taste of normalcy back," he said. "And we are looking forward to playing in front of our fans on Thursday."

For the most part, individual sports for all three county high schools are holding their own fundraising events. West Carteret just held a raffle fundraiser with a goal of $25,000 and raised just under $5,000, but the school’s primary booster event, the Captain’s Mess, was not held as usual near the start of the school year due to coronavirus restrictions. East has also not held its annual Mariner’s Feast event.
 “We’re waiting to see what the governor’s parameters are for later this year,” Griffee said. “We’re going to have less time and space than ever before, so it’ll be a challenge.”
 At Croatan, athletic director Dave Boal says funding is fine for now, but the flow of new cash has slowed.
 “We don’t have a lot of money coming in, and people aren’t looking to spend a lot right now,” Boal said. “We’re not pushing right now because there’s just too much uncertainty. I waited until the last minute to purchase a Hudl subscription, and that was only because some kids wanted to put together highlight tapes. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have bought it until I knew we were going to play.”
 There may be more than one camera trained on the action this season. The schools have moved forward with procuring live-casting equipment in the likelihood that fans, or at least most of them, will not be able to attend games.
 “Fans might not physically be able to come to a game, but we’ll have a game camera system so people can watch from home,” Griffee said. “There’s ways we’re going to use our donors’ sponsorship and get their names out there as much as we can. You can put a business’ logo on the game screen for the duration of a game, so it could end up being seen by more people than in the past.”
 For Boal, the incentive to implement a live feed of games goes beyond restrictions necessitated by the pandemic.
 “I’m not doing that because of COVID,” he said. “I’m doing that because we live between two military bases, and we have fans and parents and players who live all over the country. It’s a no-brainer.”

 If that sounds familiar, it’s because I’m borrowing this week’s opening sentence from Faron Young. It describes me perfectly this morning; sitting here talking to the walls that make up my tiny 120-square-foot sanctuary. My regulation office chair can spin all around, so I have my pick of the four walls to converse with; four walls to hear me, four walls to see, four walls too near me, closing in on me (Note 1).
 As you can probably guess, the pandemic has kept us pretty close to home for the past six months, putting a strain on our activities, the end result today being that I’m staring at these walls because all the subjects I had entertained for this week’s drivel sort of dried up in my head (Note 2).

Drugmakers and research centers around the world are working on COVID-19 vaccines, with large global trials of several of the candidates involving tens of thousands of participants well underway.As some companies close in on unveiling their initial findings &amp;ndash; with Canadian and European regulators already reviewing early data on some vaccines &amp;ndash; the following is what we know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over a million lives:Who is furthest along?US drugmaker Pfizer Inc with German partner BioNTech SE, US biotech Moderna Inc and Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc in conjunction with University of Oxford researchers could provide early analyses of data from their various large trials over the next two months. Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson is not far behind.What happens in these trials?The companies are testing their vaccines against a placebo &amp;ndash; typically saline solution &amp;ndash; in healthy volunteers to see if the rate of COVID-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot. Neither trial participants nor researchers know who has received the vaccine or placebo until the data is ready for review, or unblinded. The studies rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with COVID-19, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where the trials are being conducted. In areas with large outbreaks and community spread, infections will pile up faster.How will we know if the vaccine works?The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the World Health Organization have all set similar minimum standards for effectiveness. Vaccines must demonstrate at least 50% efficacy &amp;ndash; meaning at least twice as many infections among volunteers who got a placebo than in the vaccine group. Independent panels oversee the trials to monitor for safety and effectiveness since the data is hidden from companies and researchers. These data safety monitoring boards take a peek at the interim results at pre- determined milestones, such as after a certain number of people have become infected. It the vaccine is looking significantly better than the placebo, the companies can apply for emergency use, and the study may be halted or continue to its intended conclusion. A trial also can be halted if the panel determines the vaccine to be unsafe.Will regulators ensure a vaccine is safe before making it available to the public?The US Food and Drug Administration has said it will not approve a vaccine unless it is both effective and safe. On Tuesday, it added more stringent safety guidelines for US vaccines. The FDA wants developers to follow trial subjects for at least two months after they receive their final vaccine dose to check for any side effects that may crop up. The agency will consider an emergency use authorization (EUA) once that data is collected from at least half of the trial&amp;rsquo;s participants. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will review the vaccines for the UK and the European Medicines Agency will review vaccines for European Union use.When will regulators decide?Regulators will review the vaccines after the companies have enough data to submit applications seeking an EUA or formal approval. Pfizer/BioNtech will likely know how well its vaccine works as soon as this month, while Moderna&amp;rsquo;s first look at data is more likely to come next month. AstraZeneca could provide a look at late-stage data in the next two months. Regulators for Europe and Canada are considering data on a rolling basis, as it becomes available. The UK and the US both expect speedy reviews of initial data for possible emergency use before more traditional lengthy reviews for formal commercial approvals.Could these be the first approved coronavirus vaccines?Yes, although China and Russia are on a similar timeline. China launched an emergency use program in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection that has vaccinated hundreds of thousands of people. At least four vaccines are far along including from China National Biotec Group (CNBG), CanSino Biologics and Sinovac. Sinovac and CNBG have said to expect early trial data as soon as November. Russia&amp;rsquo;s Gamaleya Institute has begun a 40,000-person late-stage trial and is expected to have early data at the end of October or early November. Russia has also given the vaccine to at least hundreds of &amp;ldquo;high-risk&amp;rdquo; members of the general population.Is US authorization up to President Trump?The FDA must make sure that the benefits of a vaccine outweigh the risks before authorization since they are intended to be given to hundreds of millions of healthy people. However, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the authority to override the FDA&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. US President Donald Trump has complained about the new safety guidelines that would likely delay any vaccine availability until after the Nov. 3 presidential election. The Trump administration can hire and fire HHS officials, opening the possibility of political pressure to approve a vaccine.Also, catch all the latest updates and trends on the novel coronavirus with CNBCTV18's blog.

--DocBreak--
Bloomberg) -- AirAsia Group Bhd.’s long-haul arm will undergo a sweeping overhaul that includes restructuring its debt and consolidating its shares as it attempts to weather aviation’s worst-ever crisis.
 AirAsia X Bhd. will seek to restructure about 63.5 billion ($15.3 billion) of debt and reduce 90% of the company’s capital, according to an exchange filing late Tuesday. Fulfilling these proposals will be key to the survival of the company as well as its ability to remain as an ongoing concern, it said.
 “To avoid a liquidation and to allow the airline to fly again, the only option is for AirAsia X to undertake a group-wide debt and corporate restructuring and update its business model to survive and thrive in the long term,” AirAsia X said. “Based on its current financial position and the industry outlook, the group will not be able to meet its immediate debt and other financial commitments.”
 Southeast Asia’s second-biggest budget carrier by market value has been under immense pressure this year as the coronavirus pandemic roils the aviation industry, all but wiping out demand for air travel. AirAsia reported its largest loss on record in the quarter ended June 30 and Chief Executive Officer Tony Fernandes has been in talks for joint ventures and collaborations that may result in additional investment.
 Under the proposed plan, AirAsia X is seeking approval to consolidate every 10 existing AirAsia X shares into one. As of June 30, the airline had an unaudited deficit in shareholders’ equity of 960 million ringgit and its unaudited current liabilities of 3.38 billion ringgit exceeded unaudited current assets of 1.39 billion.
 Leaner Cost Base
 Having operated for 13 years, “AirAsia X focused on a growth and expansion strategy to capture growing traffic in the region by expanding fleet size and investing in new routes,” it said. “Going forward, AirAsia X will strive to rebound as a low-cost medium haul airline with a leaner and more sustainable cost base.”
 The carrier said it hopes to begin operating with two aircraft in selected markets in the first quarter of 2021 and gradually resume flights to all destinations by end-2021. Subject to all required approvals being obtained, the restructuring proposals are expected to be completed by the end of March.
 People who have purchased or made advance payments for flights that have been cancelled, or for future flights, will have their payments and deposits converted into travel credits with extended validity for future travel or the purchase of seat inventory, according to the statement.
 Lim Kian Onn, who has been a member of the board since 2012, has been appointed as deputy chairman to head the restructuring, AirAsia X said in a separate statement Tuesday.
 AirAsia X’s growing troubles had been widely flagged. The carrier said in an exchange filing in late August that it needed to reach agreements with major creditors to restructure outstanding debt because it faced “severe liquidity constraints” that threatened its ability to resume flying and continue as a going concern.
 The long-haul group also reported a net loss for the three months ended June 30 of 305.2 million ringgit ($74 million), worse than a 207.1 million ringgit deficit a year ago. Sales tumbled 91%.
 Aircraft Lessors
 AirAsia X, whose operations have been suspended since late March, said in the Aug. 26 statement that securing support from aircraft lessors, maintenance service providers and financial institutions was necessary for the restart of scheduled flights on a staggered basis in early 2021 and a return to profitability.
 In July, auditor Ernst & Young said there may be “significant doubt” over AirAsia X’s ability to continue as a going concern based on its 2019 financial report.
 AirAsiaX has a large backlog of aircraft on order from manufacturer Airbus SE. The airline has 30 A321neos, 78 A330-900 and 10 A350-900s still to be delivered.
 Airbus is particularly exposed to the Malaysian-based low-cost carrier through the A330neo, with orders from the airline making up a quarter of the aircraft’s backlog. Airbus lowered A330 output to two jets a month in April, after AirAsiaX postponed deliveries and the virus slammed aircraft demand.
 Airlines globally have grounded thousands of planes as governments restricted movement to curb the spread of the virus. Carriers have been raising funds via rights offerings and seeking state support in their efforts to stay afloat. Travel demand won’t return to pre-Covid level until 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association.

 Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. and Colombia’s Avianca Holdings have collapsed, while American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. are cutting more than 32,000 employees combined. Singapore Airlines Ltd. said last month it would have to eliminate about 4,300 jobs, or 20% of its workforce.
 AirAsia, once the poster child of the region’s revolution in low-cost travel, said Monday that it will cease operations in Japan immediately as it tries to reduce cash burn. The group has also stopped funding its Indian affiliate, people familiar with the matter said. AirAsia India Ltd.’s future may now depend on India’s Tata Group, its majority shareholder, which has provided emergency funding but has yet to commit to a full rescue.
 AirAsia X was already struggling even pre-pandemic, posting losses for six out of the seven quarters through December 2019.
 Prior to the outbreak, AirAsia X flew to places such as Australia, China, India and Saudi Arabia. It’s also the only Malaysian airline that served the U.S. -- from Kuala Lumpur to Hawaii via Osaka. In November, the Federal Aviation Administration downgraded Malaysia to so-called Category 2, barring its carriers from adding any more flights to North America.
 The carrier’s Malaysia-listed stock is down 68% this year, while shares in AirAsia have sunk 62%.

It’s a good thing that Baldur’s Gate III is in Early Access, because the game has a number of issues to work out. Some of them — a lot of them, in fact — are technical. Graphical oddities, gameplay glitches and unclear installation processes are all present and accounted for, but that’s par for the course in an Early Access game. What’s a little more disappointing is that Baldur’s Gate III had the opportunity to make the series more accessible than ever for D&D; newbies, but…

Synthetic camphor is manufactured by distillation of turpentine oil that yields pinene. Then, pinene is treated with HCL gas to produce artificial camphor, also known as synthetic camphor. Synthetic camphor is widely used in pharmaceuticals to cure mild respiratory diseases and treat cold and cough. It is also used widely in over the counter (OTC) drugs that help to relieve mild joint pain and back pain caused due to arthritis. In addition, increasing utilization of pharma garde synthetic camphor is used to treat toe nail fungal infection and relieve cramps and spasms due to its anti-spasmodic properties. These factors are anticipated to drive the of global synthetic camphor market in the forecast period. However, side effects due to ingestion of synthetic camphor can lead to irriation in throat and mouth, and in severe case it may lead to death. This factor is foreseen to hamper the market growth in the predicted time. Nevertheless, camphor is used to keep cockroaches away from wadrobes and it is used to reduce pain in kides that is caused due to eczema. These factors are predicted to act as an opportunity in the upcoming period.

Fall is one of our favorite times for festivals, including those celebrating the fruits of the harvest, such as pumpkins, gourds and apples, and the dramatic annual changing leaf colors on our native trees.
 This year, though, we’ll have to make do with experiencing many of these autumn rites of passage on our own, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt our usual routines and keep many of us isolated.
 Taking drives through the mountains or hikes along (hopefully uncrowded) woodland trails to enjoy the fall scenery are still essentially safe options, even if gathering for the usual events seems to be out of the question.
 People are still decorating their homes and yards with fall and Halloween themes, even though traditions such as trick-or-treating and Halloween parties might be limited or discouraged this year.

 # Merryville takes on Grand Lake in home opener
 Daniel Green
 BWS Sports
 It's not getting any easier for the Merryville Panthers.
 The Panthers (0-1) will open its District 4-1A slate at 7 p.m. Thursday at Keener-Cagle Stadium against the Grand Lake Hornets.
 The Hornets are coming off a win last week as they downed St. John, 53-27. Merryville dropped a 28-13 decision on the road at Pickering.
 Merryville head coach Randy Jones knows his team's hands will be full on Thursday.
 "They are a very tough team. It will be a very tough game," Jones said. "They are big, big up front."
 The Panthers will be looking to the likes of senior quarterback Blaise Duncan to get the job done, along with running back Cam'Ron Williams, who racked up 90 yards rushing last week.
 "Blaise was very accurate last week. We just didn't get much room to run after catching it," Jones said. "We threw the ball well."
 However, Jones will be looking for improved run-blocking at the point of attack.
 "We are struggling with it right now," Jones said. "We have a long way to go."

In the good book, it says, “For God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power, of love and of a sound-thinking mind.” (2 Timothy 1:7). With all the “stuff” going on in our world today, it’s quite easy to have fear or simply to just be afraid. No need to go into all the things we can worry about or fear, just suffice it to say, we are certainly entitled to be as such. But, but, but...let’s rise above it and utilize the spirit of power and love and a sound mind. Here’s how....
 \- Be generous. With your time, your money, your friendship, your willingness to help others, and your unconditional love for people. It will pay dividends you can’t even imagine.
 \- Be kind – ALWAYS. Go the extra mile. Help someone out who has absolutely no way of repaying you. People will notice your kindness before anything else.

MANSFIELD -- The cast of "Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike" had been rehearsing since January for an April production, taking their practices online when COVID-19 shut down theaters in March.
 But soon they realized their show would never debut on the Mass Music & Arts Society stage that spring. Undeterred, they recorded their performances individually from their homes on Zoom, spent weeks editing it together and created a show that will open Friday, Oct. 16, online.
 The cast looked forward to their Zoom rehearsals after everything shut down in March, said Michelle Monti, a Mansfield resident who plays Sonia.
 "None of us wanted to come in person," Monti said. "We had some older people, and the director was pregnant."
 Director Katia Greene, of Bridgewater, had a baby girl, Elsie, this summer.
 "The rehearsals were something to look forward to every week," Monti said. "It gave us stability."
 However, they soon realized Mass Music & Arts Society's theater in downtown Mansfield was unlikely to open for the stage production that spring and decided to record the show to preserve their hard work. Monti, who has professional video experience, offered to edit it. She received help from another actor, Ed Krasnow, of Plymouth, a video professor at Massasoit Community College.
 Ken Carberry, of Milton, who plays Vanya, used his background in audio to help with sound.
 All six cast members recorded their parts in their homes. Each needed to have a white background - a sheet, a wall - and make sure they had enough light. Monti described doing her part in front of her bathroom door with three lamps and her laptop balanced on a dictionary.
 Dealing with props was also a challenge. For example if one character needed to hand a mug to another the actors didn't necessarily have the exact same mugs in their homes. So sometimes the mug would change color as it changed hands.
 "We decided to own it and be funny with it," Monti said.
 The filming was done in three days, however it took more than 150 hours over the summer to edit it into a play that could be streamed.
 "It took hours and hours to make a video out of it," Monti said.
 Even editing was done through Zoom. Monti and Krasnow did it in the evenings after work.
 "He'd show me a screen and I'd talk him through it," Monti said.
 They also had to add sound effects, like doors closing.
 "We wanted to make something as entertaining and as professional as possible," Monti said.
 "Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike," a comedy by Christopher Durang, humorously adopts themes from Russian playwright Anton Chekhov.
 The cast also includes Sheila Kelleher, of Plymouth as Masha, Michael Eckenreiter, of Fairhaven, as Spike, Beth Goldman, of Norwood, as Cassandra and Alyssa Germaine, of South Attleboro, as Nina.
 In the play Vanya and Sonia's quiet lives are disturbed by the surprise arrival of their movie star sister, Masha, accompanied by Spike. Vanya, Sonia and Masha are named after Chekhov characters by their parents.
 "If you are a Chekhov fan there are lots of funny nods to his plays, but it's written so anyone can enjoy it," Monti said. "It will make you laugh and it will make you think."
 She also said the play is very relevant now because, like Chekhov's characters, the people in the play are examining their lives.
 "The pandemic has made a lot of us rethink our lives," she said. "What will I do to get through this? What do I want to do to contribute?"
 Mass Music & Arts Society Executive Director Ken Butler said the cast of "Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike" like many artists was determined to preserve the show in some way.
 "It was that need to keep doing art (during the pandemic)," he said. "We were all looking for something to do. We also saw it in the kids and parents at our MMAS Academy."
 Mass Music & Arts Society also offered a summer series of drive-in outdoor concerts and comedy nights at its space at 888 South Main St. He said not only did the shows generate needed revenue for the nonprofit arts organization but they provided a venue where comedians and musicians could perform.
 Monti said she is proud that they have pivoted the business model to allow the show to go on.
 "I think we found such creative solutions," she said "I'm so proud of our work."
 "Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike" will be streamed Oct. 16, 17 and 18 on Mass Music & Arts Society's new streaming platform, ShowTix4U. Tickets, which are $20, for this recorded event will be available soon.
 The play is one of six production being offered by the Mass Music & Arts Society between now and December. More shows are in the works for 2021 but details are still being worked out.
 "An Evening of Duets" featuring Jennifer Mischley and Butler will be live streamed from Mass Music & Arts Society's location at 888 S. Main St. for free Saturday, Oct. 10 at 8 p.m. and Sunday, Oct. 11 at 2 p.m. Because the performance involves singing, there will be no audience, Butler said. The event will kick off the 2020/21 season and introduce patrons to the new streaming service. It also begins the nonprofit's fundraising campaign.
 "Breaking the Shakespeare Code," a two-person play, will be both live streamed and performed before a limited audience Nov. 6 and 8 at 888 S Main St.
 "Becoming Dr. Ruth," a one-person show, will be both live streamed and performed before a limited audience Nov. 20, 21 and 22 at 888 S Main St.
 "A Broadway Christmas," featuring videos of the past eight years of this holiday show, will be live streamed Dec. 11 without any audience.
 "We will share our favorite moments," Butler said.
 "A Ghost Story of Christmas," a one-man show based on "A Christmas Carol," will both live streamed and performed before a limited audience Dec. 18, 19, and 20 at 888 S Main St.
 "Duets," "Broadway Christmas" and "Ghost Story" will be available later on demand, Butler said.

The novel coronavirus&amp;mdash;now named as SARS Cov 2, is a strange pathogen. Its ways of spreading are generally known&amp;mdash;via droplets&amp;mdash;like any respiratory virus. It spreads by close person to person contact within one meter of each other. Coughing, sneezing, and even speaking at close distance without a mask can lead to transmission. Some transmission also happens via commonly touched surfaces and then contaminated hands touching the eyes, nose, or mouth. These are all routes of transmission of the virus and hence infection of a new person from a person who is infected.Hence the solutions to control the disease is called by acronym SMS&amp;mdash;Social distancing, Masks, Sanitation of hands. So it is obvious that the COVID will be common in congested areas where social distancing is not possible or not maintained, where mask-wearing is not proper or not at all, and where sanitation of hands is not proper. And by and large globally these observations seem to be holding true.But in India, we are seeing a strange pattern of infection, disease and deaths. First of all, like in the world, the cases are more in major urban areas probably due to congested housing and lack of social distancing. A large majority of cases and death in India have happened in major metropolitan cities and some district headquarter cities. But when we look at where in the cities the cases have happened then the logic of SMS as preventive measures do not seem to work.From reading of newspapers and watching the tv news (which are the only sources of geographical information of cases as cities and states are not giving such information of cases) we have noted that in the urban areas somehow the slums are not the hotbeds of disease&amp;mdash;cases and deaths as one would have expected due to lack of physical space in houses and lanes, lack of proper mask-wearing and lack of water and soap for handwashing.This is gathered general information but unfortunately, there is no other reliable information from governments about the breakup of slum and non-slum number of cases. The only slum data available is from Dharavi in Bombay. There out of the population of about 8-10 lakhs, about 3000 positive cases were detected. Which is only 0.3 percent of the population and then the diseases stopped. Of course, the municipal corporation took a lot of measures. But in a crowded slum where the density of population is about 300,000+ people per square km, and where many 10 feet by 12 feet rooms, with no household toilet, have 2-8 residents how does on ensure social distancing?In such a congested environment even with the mask, the community should have gotten infected on a massive scale. As water is scarce there is less chance of frequent hand washing with soap and that too for 20 seconds each time as advised by WHO. Similar observations are there from Ahmedabad slums&amp;mdash;NGOs working slums did not report many cases of COVID&amp;mdash;yes some cases happened in April and early May, but then the number reduced from slums.But there is evidence from sero-surveillance that the virus spread rapidly in Dharavi slums infecting 57 percent of residents without causing any noticeable illness in the infected. So 570,000 people out of 10 lakhs in Dharavi got infected without symptoms. While 3,000 got some illness and tested positive for COVID. So the ratios of test positives to total infected is about 1: 190 which is one of the highest in the world. So in slums, it seems infection spreads rapidly but causes no illness in the vast majority of people.On the other hand, this virus reached and caused disease in the best of the homes of the richest, influential and the most elite. Take, for example, Amitabh Bachchan&amp;mdash;a famous film star and family, many senior politicians who have a high level of security, senior IAS and IPS officers, heads of large businesses. These people must have had all the means to follow SMS strategy to avoid the virus. They have large houses with big compounds, they have many washbasins in the home and also a personal toilet with washbasin in their office. They go by personal car without any crowding. They can afford to wear the fanciest masks and change it every day. They have the best doctors to advise them on how to protect from COVID. These amenities are also available to many upper-middle-class people in cities. In spite of all this the above category of the elite got the COVID disease. Hence I call it a VIP virus. The enigma is that in urban poor quarters and the slums the COVID is not so rampant as one would assume.This raises the question why are slum dwellers relatively less vulnerable in spite of lack of social distancing, masks and sanitation. Some clever editors coined the term &amp;ldquo;immunological black matter&amp;rdquo; for a variety of possible explanations that prevent the new virus affecting a large proportion of the community in European countries which was originally proposed by Prof. Karl Friston of University College London.My hypothesis is that the poor in India have some form of immunity to the new infection, most probably due to exposure to multiple previous microbial infections caused by their poor living conditions. I call it &amp;ldquo;poor people&amp;rsquo;s immunity&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;pauper&amp;rsquo;s immunity&amp;rdquo;. This immunity is such that they do develop an infection but do not fall sick or show clinical symptoms. This is aptly seen in Dharavi slums&amp;mdash;570,000 infected and developed antibodies to COVID but only about 3000 got symptoms and tested positive for COVID. Many cities also showed that a large proportion of the population tested sero-positive without symptoms. This varies from 15-51 percent in Ahmedabad, Delhi, Pune and Bombay.To summarise, it seems that the virus rapidly spreads and infects many people but only some with weak immunity show symptoms, get tested and turn out positive. The way the virus is getting transmitted the rich and powerful is not clear but they are not immune to this disease&amp;mdash;may be they are more vulnerable, but the poor are relatively immune or resistant to clinical disease. The implications of this is as the epidemic spreads to rural areas, the virus will not cause much clinical disease and death in rural areas where also people are poor and may have a high natural resistance to diseases like the urban slum dwellers. If this hypothesis is true&amp;mdash;for which we need granular data to prove it&amp;mdash;it will be a ray of hope as the pandemic rages across India.&amp;mdash;Dr Dileep Mavalankar is the Director, IIPHG.

At the moment there are only two multiplayer modes: Dogfight and Fleet Battles. Dogfights are straight-up deathmatches, but Fleet Battles are like Conquest matches from _Battlefield_. You gain morale by taking out enemies which is used to make warships vulnerable, with two teams taking turns attacking and defending as the pendulum swings. This makes for some memorable moments, especially when it gets tight right at the end and your last line of defence is looking weak. This is where clinical shooting and clever item use come into play.

FALL RIVER - More than six month after closing to audiences, the Narrows Center for the Arts is ready to welcome at least some of its music fans back for concerts. This month, the venue will also open its new yoga space on the second floor.
 Under the latest guidelines released by Gov. Charlie Baker, the Narrows Center for the Arts is able to open again to a limited number of patrons. It's news Narrows Executive Director Patrick Norton, has been hoping to hear for months and now the center is geared up for its first concert on Friday, Oct. 8, with Dennis Brennan Band.
 Under Baker's guidelines, lower risk communities - those that have not been designated as red for the last three weekly Department of Public Health reports -- were moved into Step II of Phase III as of Oct. 5. That step allows for indoor performance venues to open with a maximum capacity of 250.
 Reiterating the governor's reasoning for the expansion due to the fact that states that have had similar "highly organized" events haven't had significant increases in COVID-19 spikes, Norton said it's essential for everyone to wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines. "That's the key to moving forward," he added.
 By the 50 percent rule, Norton said they could put 250 people in the arts venue for a concert, but on opening they're being extra cautious by limiting the first few tickets to 175. "People are confident that the Narrows runs a quality operation and that we care about our fans," he said. "I think there's a desire for live music. It's been shut down for a long time and I think the governor has given us an opportunity and it's up to venues and the fanbase…. We've got a whole COVID plan in place."
 Norton said they thought they might be allowed to bring back 25 percent of its audience in August, so planning began this summer for how it would look once fans returned. The venue has also been gearing up for the opening of its 2,500 square-foot yoga space, which will happen on Oct. 14. Yoga will be offered every Wednesday at 10 a.m. and every Saturday at 9 a.m. with tickets being sold for the classes on the Narrows' website. "We've got a big (yoga) space to put 20 people in with lots of ventilation," he added. "We were gearing up for yoga and serendipitously the governor said we can do shows. These are all coming together."
 In preparation for welcoming back fans, they have relocated the seating 25 feet away from the stage. Seats are arranged in pods of either one, two or four and those pods are spaced six-feet apart in all directions. Fans will have to purchase tickets in pods of one, two or four. "We have a large space. If you just went on our square footage alone, we have room for 550," said Norton.
 In the hard-hit music industry, Norton said they're fortunate to be able to welcome back fans though it will be a long road back for everyone in the industry. Citing a survey in Pollstar magazine, he said 89 percent of respondents said there should be shared responsibility in the financial implications of COVID-19. "Meaning that we're all going to have to take less money to get going - that's agents, promoters, venues, musicians - to get this thing up and running. That's just the way it is," said Norton. "It's going to be a long road back in the music industry. I found that interesting, but most of the people in the music business do it because they love music."
 Over the past few months, the Narrows has built up a new following to its YouTube page where the arts venue has been streaming live concerts from the venue on Friday nights. "We've had a great response from our patrons in both financially and viewership. We've got one of the higher rated live-streams around," said Norton.
 Even with the ability to open to a limited number of patrons, Norton said they will continue those live-streaming concerts. In part, he said that's due to the fact that they have become popular with audiences, but also to serve that segment of the Narrows audience that is likely not going to return to the arts center until there is a COVID-19.
 "Testing is the way back. It's going to be hard to get back to full capacity until they come up with an 'insta test,' that you can get results in five or 10 minutes when people come in," said Norton. "They're not going to open up the big stadiums until they have testing."
 For now, Norton is adding more shows to the lineup for the Narrows' venue this fall.
 Baker's Step 2 Phase 3 expansion also allows for fitting rooms to open in retail stores, at arcades and indoor and outdoor recreation businesses, additional Step II activities such as trampolines, obstacle courses, roller rinks and laser tag will also be permitted and capacity will increase to 50 percent. Gyms, museums, libraries and driving and flight schools will also be permitted to increase their capacity to 50 percent.
