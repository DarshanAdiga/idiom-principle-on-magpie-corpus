Charming Bill Murray is the best Bill Murray. He’s been cultivating the persona of the lovable bastard since his days back at “Saturday Night Live,” but like a good cocktail, it’s bringing out the perfect mix of charisma and jerk that puts Murray at the top of his game.
 One of Murray’s best bartenders is writer/director Sofia Coppola, who previously worked with him in the fantastic “Lost in Translation.” The two have paired up again in “On the Rocks,” a bouncy, comedic misadventure where Murray plays an aging playboy named Felix reconnecting with his middle-aged daughter Laura, played by Rashida Jones.
 It’s probably unfair to have led with Murray, since Jones, a fine comedic actress in her own right, is really the heart of the film. She plays a physically and emotionally exhausted mother of two young girls who has put her writing career on hold mostly because she doesn’t have any energy to do anything other than wrangle her family.

When I pen these columns, I try to keep a measured and respectful tone, even when I have serious disagreement with the person or issue that is the subject of the column.
 I am the first to admit that I sometimes (or maybe more frequently) fall short of achieving this goal, but I try. Really, I try.
 However, there are times when what we see happening is so frustrating, when the actions of some in power are so duplicitous, that the outer boundaries of civility are sorely tested.

The Wentzville School District has announced that it will provide free meals for all students in the District beginning October 1, through December 31, 2020, or until available federal funding runs out. The meals are being provided regardless of eligibility as a result of the extension of waivers by the US Department of Agriculture related to the Seamless Summer Option program. This includes children ages 1-18 who reside in the Wentzville School District boundaries but are not enrolled in a WSD school.
 Typically, the USDA provides reimbursements to school districts in order to provide free or reduced-price meals for students who qualify based on their family’s household income. The waivers related to income qualification that were implemented earlier this year are being extended as part of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, and in light of the exceptional circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

The lone non-senior for York, junior Piper Fernau, placed 66th (+112) with a Monday score of 127 and a Tuesday mark of 129.
 Fernau is a player that started to get her swing back in the middle of the season, which helped her move into the team’s top five before conference and districts.
 “That’s important to play in a conference and district tournament as a junior so you can have that experience for your senior year,” Miller said. “And it’s important to play in a state tournament. You don’t want to show up to the state tournament as a senior and have never played in one before. That’s something I think will help her (Fernau) down the road.”

Let us talk about the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.
 Cutting to the chase, the current process, albeit being pursued with unseemly haste, is constitutional. A sitting president has a four-year term and at any point in that term he (or she) has the absolute constitutional power to make a nomination. As a matter of comity, they should at least have a reasonable expectation that their nominee will, at a minimum, be given a hearing.
 Should the current hearings lead to a Senate vote confirming the nomination, the appointment of Judge Barrett to a position with lifetime tenure is entirely constitutional.
 As suggested in an earlier column, the question is not if the Barrett nomination can go forward, but, as a matter of fair play or honor, should it go forward?
 In 2016, another sitting president made a nomination to the Supreme Court with 269 days left in his term. He had the absolute right to make the nomination, and he had the reasonable expectation that the Senate would act upon that nomination – up or down.
 That expectation went down in flames when one man, Sen. Mitch McConnell, decided that not only would there not be a vote up or down on the nomination, there would not even be hearings. Using his power as Senate leader, and with the complicity of his fellow Senate Republicans, McConnell simply sat on the nomination and ran out the clock on that president’s term of office.
 To give some political cover to their actions, the Republican caucus concocted an argument that when a Supreme Court nomination is made in a presidential election year, action on that nomination should be held until after the election “to give the people a chance to make their choice known.”
 While there may be some merit to this argument, there is nothing in the Constitution that supports it. For a party that prides itself in proclaiming it follows the law as written, it is exceedingly strange that it relies upon adding to the letter of that law something that is not currently there as authority to support its position.

COLUMBUS - The Class C State Golf Championships wrapped up on Tuesday at Elks Country Club, with both the individual title and the race for state runner-up going down to the wire.
 The team champion was never in doubt as Broken Bow ran away from the rest of the field with a team score of 732, which was 46 strokes better than runner-up Lincoln Christian who ended up with a 778 and third place went to West Point- Beemer with a score of 785.
 The Heartland Huskies who bounced back and forth from second to fifth place all day long in the team race, ended up in fourth place, just two strokes behind West Point-Beemer.
 The individual title race involved four players most of the day, but eventually came down to the defending champion Lynzi Becker of Cozad and last year’s runner-up, Boone-Central’s Abbigail Brodersen.

Since March we have seen a lot of ups and downs navigating our new lives during coronavirus.
 The early days of lockdowns were unpredictable and sometimes unnerving. I remember those few weeks when it seemed that toilet paper was more valuable than gold. Luckily, things are more predictable now in large part because our systems are still hard at work getting us the essentials despite the fact that the pandemic is still occurring.
 Our health care heroes and essential workers learned how to adapt earlier than a lot of us.

Moreover, no less a personage than the senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, is immortalized on tape sanctimoniously proclaiming that if an election year vacancy occurred in the next administration, they would similarly withhold action until after the ensuing presidential election. He challenged the audience to hold him to his word. No Republican senator publicly took issue with this promise.
 We now know what that word is worth because he now is a leading figure in ramming this nomination through the confirmation process. In this instance, Sen. Graham has shown himself to be a prevaricator – which is to say in perhaps less respectful language, a liar.
 But no, the two situations are not identical, proclaim Sens. McConnell and Graham! In the former case, the president and the Senate majority were of different political parties and it was expected by the founding fathers that in such a case, no action would be taken on the nomination. In the present case, the president and the Senate majority are of the same political party and therefore, action on the nomination is appropriate.
 Two things. First, there is nothing in the Constitution that supports this construction. If the founders were in favor of such a process, they would have said so. Second, at the time the Constitution was written, there were no formally constituted political parties. If anything, it is more reasonable to assume that the expectation of the founders was that with a nomination of such importance, public officers would set factional differences aside and act in the best interests of the country rather than count noses to determine who was in the majority and who was in the minority.
 For the record, again, the Republican caucus is acting constitutionally. But, to say it one more time, if their word is to carry any weight in the future, is it acting wisely?
 On Monday Republican Sen. Charles Grassley solemnly warned that if the Democrats soon hold the White House and congressional majorities (oh, wait, that pesky election), they would (horrors!) “pack the court” in a balancing effort to respond to a likely 6-3 conservative super-majority.
 I am not saying the Democrats should do this, but if the Republicans are using their constitutional powers to empanel Judge Barrett, what is to prevent the Democrats from using the power of the majority to add members to the court? After all, historically, the number of Supreme Court justices has gone up and down over time.
 Slippery slopes can have unintended consequences for everyone involved.
 One final thing, while Sen. Grassley’s concern over court packing is admirable, the facts are that of the 23 Supreme Court appointments since 1969, 19 were made by Republican presidents, and four by Democrats.
 When it comes to packing courts, the good senator apparently knows whereof he speaks.

 # Letter: Vote for Pedersen for council
 Ventura County Star
 View Comments
 I’ve recently gotten to know Nancy Pedersen after having seen her presentation at the virtual Candidate Town Hall in September. I was impressed that she wants to dedicate her time to improving our community.
 After talking to Pedersen recently, I could tell how passionate she is/will continue to be about key issues that are important to Ventura. These include helping small businesses to succeed; investing in services for the homeless and mentally ill; protecting beaches and parks; ensuring responsible use of tax dollars; and attracting new businesses and creating jobs.
 Pedersen has been co-chairing the Best Day Foundation, which has been putting on an annual beach day for children with special needs. She has also been involved with the Ventura Visitors and Convention Bureau, in which she has served as board chair for the last six years. This experience has given her insight into the operations and economics of Ventura.
 Pedersen has run a small business (Sunflowers on the Square) in downtown Ventura, which has made her aware of what’s important to the other small business owners in Ventura. With a law degree and her work in real estate and business contracts, Pedersen has become very detail-oriented and will be able to understand and improve upon complicated issues within the city.
 Pedersen mentioned to me that, “My main interest is to help the city of Ventura to become proactive in looking at housing opportunities in order to meet housing needs. We need to be addressing our economy and economic strategy in order to improve it. We need to also improve upon the communication between the government and the constituents.”
 I would highly recommend that you vote for Nancy Pedersen for City Council District 7, in order for her to be able to improve the city of Ventura for all of us.
  _Carol Leish, Ventura_

Enrollment for the Eli Lilly trial, which was sponsored by several branches of the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs, among other organizations, had been continuing. But Tuesday, multiple officials sent emails to researchers telling them to stop adding volunteers to the study out of an “abundance of caution.”
 Several experts praised the trial’s sponsors for halting the trial to address the safety of their product, as AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have done with their vaccines. “They are doing things by the book,” said Dr. Maricar Malinis, an infectious disease physician at Yale.
 In a statement sent over email, Molly McCully, a spokeswoman for Eli Lilly, confirmed the pause. “Safety is of the utmost importance to Lilly,” she said. “Lilly is supportive of the decision by the independent DSMB to cautiously ensure the safety of the patients participating in this study,” referring to the independent panel of experts, or the data and safety monitoring board.
 Eli Lilly is one of several companies pursuing experimental treatments for COVID-19 that use monoclonal antibodies — mass-produced mimics of immune molecules the human body produces in reaction to the coronavirus.
 Eli Lilly’s product is similar to a treatment designed by drug company Regeneron, which developed an antibody therapy given to President Donald Trump after he tested positive for the coronavirus this month. Trump has promoted the treatments, without evidence, as a “cure” for his condition and has suggested that their approval and widespread distribution could be imminent.
 The week after the president was treated, both companies applied for emergency clearance for their products from the Food and Drug Administration. (Eli Lilly has applied for authorization of its drug for mild or moderate cases of COVID-19, not for use in hospitalized patients like those enrolled in the halted trial.)

I am talking about the late 1960s to early 70s. In the process of literary maturation, his image looms large in our consciousness as a fighter for justice, voice of the voiceless, critic and cultural icon. He lampoons the vanity of the western world. He criticises the inequity in our hackneyed political union. He turned attention, with the potency of the pen, to the problems of the minorities and of women (Remember THE WIVES’ REVOLT). As a teacher, he stood tall among those who tried to make Nigeria a knowledge-based society. The theatre is hallowed with his works, drama classics that have stood and will continue to stand the test of time. On record, he established the PECREP THEATRE, the first repertory theatre in Nigeria, in 1980.
