"Betrayal tells the story of Emma's love affair with her husband's best friend Jerry. Despite their efforts to hide the romance, it turns out that husband Robert knew about it all along. A sharp look into the nature of romantic relationships, Harold Pinter's Betrayal starts in 1977 when long time lovers Jerry and Emma meet after her marriage to her husband Robert dissolves, and then backtracks all the way to 1968 when their affair first began. As the years spin backwards, a complex web of secrets about the trio emerges and calls into question the nature of their intimacy -- as friends, as partners, as spouses. A play about love, lust, and time, Betrayal poetically explores the rift between memory and reality." - Tim Everitt, director

EAST LANSING -- The Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) made the very difficult decision Friday afternoon to postpone the 2020 prep football season to the Spring of 2021 due to football's higher risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus.
 Along with the postponement of the football season, it was also announced that the remainder of the Fall sports calendar, including volleyball, cross county, girl's golf, boy's tennis, and boy's soccer will proceed as planned.
 Per the MHSAA statement competition guidelines for the remaining Fall sports will be announced on Aug. 19.
 According to the press release from the MHSAA, the "football season switch was made based on consultation with state health department officials and after surveying MHSAA member high schools on their progress and preferences after the first four days of practice. Football is considered a high-risk sport for potential spread of the COVID-19 virus because of its level of player-to- player contact."
 "At the end of the day, we did everything we could to find a path forward for football this fall," MHSAA Executive Director Mark Uyl said. "But while continuing to connect with the Governor's office, state health department officials, our member schools' personnel and the Council, there is just too much uncertainty and too many unknowns to play football this fall. No one is willing to take the risk of COVID being passed on because of a high-risk sport. Decisions have to be made on our other sports as well, but none of those carry the same close, consistent, and face-to-face contact as football."
 While the exact details of the changes are yet unknown, the MHSAA states the schedules and formats will be announced over the next few months and that the "MHSAA will be working to limit overlap of spring football and the traditional Spring sport seasons."
 The full press release from the MHSAA reads as follows-
 The Representative Council of the Michigan High School Athletic Association today announced it will move the 2020 Fall football season to Spring 2021, due to football's higher risk for spreading COVID-19, with the rest of Fall sports proceeding as scheduled.
 The football season switch was made based on consultation with state health department officials and after surveying MHSAA member high schools on their progress and preferences after the first four days of practice. Football is considered a high-risk sport for potential spread of the COVID-19 virus because of its level of player-to-player contact.
 A total of 34,219 student-athletes played football at MHSAA member schools during the 2019 season. A total of 520 11-player teams and 83 8-player teams were anticipated during late summer to play football this fall season.
 "At the end of the day, we did everything we could to find a path forward for football this fall," MHSAA Executive Director Mark Uyl said. "But while continuing to connect with the Governor's office, state health department officials, our member schools' personnel and the Council, there is just too much uncertainty and too many unknowns to play football this fall.
 "No one is willing to take the risk of COVID being passed on because of a high-risk sport. Decisions have to be made on our other sports as well, but none of those carry the same close, consistent, and face-to-face contact as football."
 The MHSAA announced July 17 it would proceed this school year with its traditional calendar beginning with Fall sports but with enhanced precautions to help limit the spread of COVID-19. At that time, the MHSAA also stated it would move football, and other Fall sports seasons, to the spring of 2021 if they were deemed unsafe to proceed when originally scheduled. Football was allowed to begin practice, with helmets but no other padding, on Aug. 10.
 Volleyball and soccer are considered moderate-risk for virus spread, while cross country, golf, tennis and swimming & diving are considered low-risk. Cross Country, Lower Peninsula girls golf and boys tennis and Upper Peninsula girls tennis began practice Aug. 12; golf and tennis teams may begin competing Aug. 19, and cross country teams may begin competing Aug. 21.
 Volleyball, boys soccer and Lower Peninsula girls swimming & diving also began practice Aug. 12, and competition guidelines for those sports will be announced Aug. 19. Schools in regions under Phase 4 of the MI Safe Start Plan remain unable to play volleyball or swim/dive indoors due to governmental restrictions. Further guidance from Governor Gretchen Whitmer's office is expected in the near future regarding these indoor facilities.
 Details for the spring football season including a specific schedule and format will be announced over the next few months. The MHSAA will be working to limit overlap of spring football and the traditional Spring sport seasons.
 "While this is tremendously disappointing, we will do everything possible to provide the best possible experience in the spring while adding football into the calendar," Uyl said.
 The MHSAA is a private, not-for-profit corporation of voluntary membership by more than 1,500 public and private senior high schools and junior high/middle schools which exists to develop common rules for athletic eligibility and competition. No government funds or tax dollars support the MHSAA, which was the first such association nationally to not accept membership dues or tournament entry fees from schools. Member schools which enforce these rules are permitted to participate in MHSAA tournaments, which attract more than 1.4 million spectators each year.

Google has typically offered a number of “perks” to those who have bought its hardware, including Chromecasts, Chromebooks, and Pixel phones. Users noticed around August 1 that the company is making a short-term subscription to its Stadia service available to those who purchase a Chromebook.
 In fact, buying a Chromebook comes with two Stadia perks. The first offers $20 off the purchase of the Stadia Premiere Edition, which essentially replaces the Stadia Founder’s Edition cloud gaming hardware that launched and almost immediately sold out. But as the second perk points out, you don’t even need the Premiere Edition hardware: Chromebooks now ship with three months of Stadia Pro, the Stadia cloud gaming service.
 Be aware that this is a trial. After the three-month service period expires, you’ll be signed up for Stadia Pro at $9.99 per month. Also, you’ll need to own a Chromebook released in June, 2017, or later.

The Wolfpack stepped down July 20, saying they could not afford to play out the remainder of the English Super League season. The transatlantic rugby league team had been sidelined since mid-March due to the global pandemic with Williams taking advantage of the hiatus to have minor knee surgery.
 The Toronto team, which is currently for sale, has told its players they are free to go out on loan the remainder of the season. Williams, one of the Wolfpack's two marquee players, is under contract to Toronto in 2021, but the future of the franchise remains up in the air.
 Several other Wolfpack players have already made a move. New Zealand forward Bodene Thompson (Leeds Rhinos), Australian-born Ricky Leutele (Melbourne Storm) and Gareth O'Brien (Castleford Tigers) are all wearing different colours.
 Toronto has not made its payroll since June 10, with majority owner David Argyle stepping away from the franchise.

The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced on Wednesday that Broadband Communications North (BCN) will receive $9.9 million in funding to improve satellite internet speeds in five remote northern Manitoba First Nations.
 These First Nations include Tadoule Lake, Barren Lands, Lac Brochet, Pukatawagan, and Shamattawa. The funding will allow BCN to improve service to speeds of 10 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 1 Mbps upload (10/1 Mbps), with unlimited monthly capacity.
 In the press release, CRTC stated that this project is an interim step with more improvements to come in the future.
 "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical need for reliable communications networks to navigate everyday life, as many Canadians were challenged by poor Internet connections. Today's announcement marks a key milestone toward closing the digital divide," said Ian Scott, chairperson and CEO of the CRTC in a press release.
 "This initial funding from the CRTC Broadband Fund will improve access in the North and have a positive impact on many communities. We recognize, however, that too many regions across the country are still underserved. The assessment of the applications we received following our second call for applications is a high priority."
 This satellite project is among the five projects that will receive funding from the Broadband Fund to improve Internet access services to more than 10,100 households in 51 communities, the significant majority of which are Indigenous.
 The Broadband Fund will provide $72 million to projects in the N.W.T., Yukon and northern Manitoba. These selected projects all serve communities with broadband Internet access services that do not currently meet the universal service objective.
 (BCN) filed an application last year on October 3 in response to the CRTC's first call for applications for funding from the Broadband Fund.
 Originally, BCN requested funding for seven communities including St. Theresa Point First Nation and Wasagamack. However, the two communities were not eligible because they have existing terrestrial connections via microwave link.
 BCN also has a separate project underway to improve the infrastructure in these communities, with committed funding support from other government sources.
 "Overall, we see significant gaps in affordability and coverage for our rural communities that are generally due to the higher cost of service and lower average income. These communities are much underserved," said Erin Knight, digital rights campaigner for OpenMedia.
 "Right now we see in rural and remote communities like Canada, especially in places like northern Manitoba, currently have far less access to the Internet and also much lower speeds. Just recently, Internet performance test shows that during the pandemic, rural speeds were sometimes slower than urban speeds. That is why we need to see this investment come thru from the federal government, especially for organizations like BCN."
 OpenMedia is a non-profit advocacy organization that works to keep the Internet open, affordable and surveillance-free.
 "We still have a far way to go as a country and province to connect everyone to affordable and good-quality Internet. Moving forward, there is still so much that needs to be done as these communities are very far behind," said Knight.

The 46-year-old VOC Port, which was struggling to handle even mid-sized vessels till a decade ago, has spelt out ambitious plans to be executed on an outlay of ₹7,000 crore in four phases to transform the seaport into a transhipment hub.
 After the inner-harbour development was carried out recently to deepen the berths and also the entry and exit points, the port’s depth was increased to 12.80 metres from 10.90 metres and in the second phase, the depth will be increased to 14.50 metres. With the increase in draft, the port is inching towards handling larger vessels to transform itself into a transhipment hub.
 Informing this during the Independence Day celebration address, chairman of VOC Port T.K. Ramachandran said the ₹7,000-crore plan would act as a catalyst to units manufacturing fertilizers, petrochemicals, edible oil, LNG and wind turbine generator blades coming up on 1,689 acres of land near the port. Despite the slowdown, a few had planned to visit the port shortly to explore the possibilities of establishing their units here.

The new term begins in January in conjunction with the NADA annual convention, to be held in New Orleans.
 Cannon has served as the director since 2015.
 As the liaison between Mississippi and the national association, Cannon represents Mississippi automobile dealers in Washington, D.C., and keeps dealers here abreast of any changes, concerns or issues.
 “I keep our dealers here in Mississippi aware of any changes or concerns coming down the pipeline, whether they are legislation affairs, regulatory affairs or from the manufacturers,” Cannon said.
 Cannon is the owner of Cannon Motors of Mississippi. He started in the automobile business working for his father’s used car lot in Calhoun City.
 His company owns several dealerships in Mississippi, including Cannon Chevrolet Cadillac Nissan and Cannon Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram in Greenwood. In Oxford, he’s been in business since 2008 and expanded in 2016 with the purchase of Chandler Nissan.
 Cannon served on the Mississippi Automobile Dealers Association Board of Directors as an officer before serving as chairman in 2011-2012. Participating on a state and national level is a way to give back to his fellow automobile dealers, he said.
 “I’ve always been one of those guys who felt like I needed to give back,” Cannon said. “And in return I always felt I get more out of it than you give. I wanted to give back to our dealers and our state and the automobile industry in general and felt this was a way to make an impact and a difference in our state and on the national level as well.”
 While serving as the Mississippi director, Cannon has served in numerous leadership positions, including NADA show chairman, and has served on the Dealership Operations, Industry Relations, Regulatory Affairs, and Public Affairs committees.
 Cannon said the biggest issue for the automobile industry currently, locally and nationally is COVID-19.
 “Getting everyone adjusted to more online buying is a major issue and obviously, getting the manufacturers up and running so we can get our inventory back up,” he said. “Inventory is at the lowest it’s ever been.”

At first glance, it might seem quite easy to buy a car, but this is never a purchase that you should make in the spur of the moment. If you’re knowledgeable on the subject, you need to take some time reviewing different cars, reading about them, comparing them and contrasting them, knowing how to maintain them and how to “put them to sleep” during the winter, and only then seeing which one’s the best fit for you. But what happens when you’re not knowledgeable about cars? Even though this is a stigma that’s not 100% true, gay people know somewhat less about cars, yet they need one to get from one Grindr hookup to the other. If you’re a gay couple and want to buy a car together, know all of your options. This is not a small investment.

Financial services firm Edward Jones announced it is renewing its strategic alliance with the Alzheimer’s Association, committing $25 million over the next five years, according to the four Defiance Edward Jones financial advisors. The commitment matches the $25 million already raised by Edward Jones, its associates and communities since launching the alliance in 2016.
 The total investment, over the course of 10 years, is the largest commitment ever pledged by a corporate partner to the Alzheimer’s Association and is being used to enhance care and support programs, provide educational materials for Edward Jones clients and associates and advance critical Alzheimer’s research.
 Alzheimer’s disease is a concern for many Americans, and according to a recent Edward Jones and Age Wave survey, U.S. retirees rank Alzheimer’s and dementia as the most feared health condition of later life, a greater threat than COVID-19, cancer, heart attack and stroke. More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s and 16 million serve as unpaid caregivers.
 “Our purpose at Edward Jones is to improve the lives of our clients, their families and our communities,” said Edward Jones managing partner Penny Pennington. “Alzheimer’s disease devastates relationships and finances — two things we work so hard to protect. We are going to keep walking, educating and advocating until we put an end to this terrible disease.”
 It is estimated that nearly 150,000 Edward Jones clients and countless associate families have Alzheimer’s or another dementia. To support early detection, Edward Jones provides the Alzheimer’s Association’s “10 Warning Signs of Alzheimer’s” online education program to its financial advisors. In turn, Edward Jones financial advisors host joint seminars with the Alzheimer’s Association in their communities on ways clients and caregivers can protect health and wealth when facing a long-term illness.
 “We are honored and deeply appreciative that Edward Jones, its associates and communities are committing to work with us for another five years to achieve our vision to end Alzheimer’s and all other dementia,” said Harry Johns, president and CEO of the Alzheimer’s Association. “As the number of people affected by Alzheimer’s and other dementia continues to grow, Edward Jones’ extraordinary commitment to the cause is crucial in funding research, supporting education, advancing access to care and broadening awareness of this disease.”
 In 2016, Edward Jones signed on as the first national presenting sponsor for the Alzheimer’s Association’s annual Walk to End Alzheimer’s, the world’s largest event to raise awareness and funds for Alzheimer’s care, support and research.
 Currently, the Edward Jones Alzheimer’s Research Fund is supporting the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN and DAIN TU) studies at Washington University in St. Louis, focused on increasing effective, safe and efficient clinical trials to improve the scientific understanding of inherited Alzheimer’s disease.
 The event officially kicks off Edward Jones’ support of the 2020 Walk to End Alzheimer’s season where an estimated 20,000 Edward Jones associates, clients and their families will participate in more than 600 walks throughout the country.
 With the health and well-being of all Edward Jones’ clients, colleagues and communities in mind, Edward Jones continues to encourage social distancing and discourage large group gatherings. However, this shouldn’t prevent Edward Jones from its advocacy and support for this important cause.
 In light of these unique circumstances, Edward Jones and the Alzheimer’s Association made the decision to officially shift Edward Jones’ participation in this year’s Walk to End Alzheimer’s away from in-person gatherings to virtual events.

Calculate the deposit that you will be able to put down, see what monthly payments you can afford and such. Apart from that, see how much you will have to spend a year for maintenance, based on the type of car that you buy. Your credit score is also something you should bear in mind, so get all the info that you will need. This will help you negotiate the price of the car and thus save some money in the long run.

 She also claimed the defendant derived pleasure from sexually assaulting the victim.
 Ravinderpal Singh, defending, said his client was just 20 at the time of the assaults and had no prior convictions.
 High Court judge Pang Khang Chau found that Srihari had done the bidding of the "real mastermind", the boyfriend, but said he couldn't ignore that he had contested his charges.
 He found Srihari guilty of four counts of rape, one count of sexual assault by penetration, four counts of outrage of modesty, and one count of making an obscene film.

When it comes to inputs we see a few notable differences. In the Q90's favor, it charges via USB-C, a welcome upgrade to the Micro-USB on the PocketGo.
 The rest of the picture is more problematic. The buttons and d-pad on the Q90 are squishy and feature sharper edges, compared to the PocketGo’s clicky feedback and rounded edges. I’ve preferred clickier controls, so there is some subjectivity here. However, I also wasn't a fan of the Q90's thumbstick (on the left side) for use in supported games. It's of the sliding variety, which means there is very little travel. Resistance is tight enough that it's hard to slide in a smooth fashion.
 In the audio department, both feature a 1/8-inch headphone jack. The Q90 has stereo speakers where the PocketGo has mono, and that seems like a plus. Unfortunately the Q90’s speakers are located on the back of the device, so the sound moves away from you, and can also get muffled by hand placement. The PocketGo is the better option if you don’t want to use headphones.

The MX Master 3 design doesn’t deviate much from previous MX mice, including the MX Master 2S, its predecessor, which I have not used. Made for the right hand (sorry, lefties), the Master 3 has a cradle for your thumb, and the body of the mouse rests under your palm. It’s a comfortable design for me, and I never experience any fatigue or discomfort. (For reference, I wear a large- size men’s glove.)
 In addition to the standard left and right mouse buttons, there are three buttons for your thumb: one at the base of the cradle, and back/forward (or undo/redo) buttons at the top. The predecessors to the MX Master 3 had the back/forward button behind the thumbwheel and stacked on top of each other, which I found awkward, so I didn’t use those buttons. But they’re now placed below the thumbwheel and in a more intuitive front and back alignment, which is an improvement.

 "Pakistan is the ultimate destination of the people of Jammu & Kashmir in view of the historic, religious and geographical relations between the two and the Kashmiris will lend all of their energies to reach the destination come what may \- through the liberation of the IIOJK and materialization of the dream of accession of the entire Jammu & Kashmir State to Pakistan under the spirit of the historic July 19, 1947 resolution of the Kashmir's accession unanimously passed in Srinagar", the speakers at a gathering hosted to mark independence day of Pakistan under the auspices of the Global Pak Kashmir Supreme Council (GPKSC), a Kashmiri international rights outfit, at its head office in London on Friday, says a message received here on Saturday.

The Q90 does have a larger battery than the PocketGo at 1500mAh versus 1000mAh. While the larger screen negates some of those gains, the Q90 still lasted longer, so it earns the battery advantage. On top of that it’s easily replaceable compared to the PocketGo, which is always a plus in my book.
 When it comes to hardware I think there are some great advantages the Q90 has over the PocketGo, most notably the larger screen, bigger battery, and more comfortable dimensions. But the PocketGo is superior when it comes to screen quality, button feel, and speaker placement.
 ## Q90 vs PocketGo: Software
 The amount of emulators the Q90 supports is staggering (as with most of these devices), with support for GameBoy, GameBoy Color, GameBoy Advance, NES, SNES, Master System, Genesis, PC Engine, Neo Geo, Playstation 1, and more. Unfortunately performance in most of these emulators falls behind what you’ll experience in the similarly priced PocketGo.

IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of residents in Iowa's three largest cities remained without electricity Wednesday, two days after a rare wind storm that hit the Midwest devastated the state's power grid, flattened valuable corn fields and killed two people.
 Major parts of Iowa suffered outages Monday as straight-line winds toppled trees, snapped poles and downed power lines. The storm known as a derecho had winds of up to 112 mph near Cedar Rapids, as powerful as an inland hurricane, as it tore from eastern Nebraska across Iowa and parts of Wisconsin, Indiana and Illinois, including Chicago and its suburbs.
 Crews have been working around the clock to restore electricity, but they've been hindered by large trees that are blocking many roads and sitting on top of power lines. Those trees must be removed before power can be restored.
 Iowa's three largest metropolitan areas of Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Davenport still had widespread outages as of Wednesday morning. Other cities including Marshalltown and Clinton were also hard hit by the derecho, which produces winds that come across in a line and can spread damage over a large area more like an inland hurricane than a quick more powerful tornado.
 Alliant Energy said about 180,000 of its customers are without power, about half of which are in the Cedar Rapids area. MidAmerican Energy said about 120,000 of its Iowa customers remain without power, more than half them in the Des Moines area.
 Mediacom said Wednesday that it has restored internet service to about half of the 340,000 customers that were offline a day earlier in Iowa, Illinois and Indiana. But many others may be without service until their power is restored, a process that could still take multiple days in places.
 The storm caused extensive crop damage in the nation's No. 1 corn producing state as it tore across Iowa's center from west to east.
 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said Tuesday that about 10 million acres of Iowa’s nearly 31 million acres of agriculture land sustained damage. About 24 million acres of that is land typically planted primarily in corn and soybeans.
 In addition, tens of millions of bushels of grain that were stored at co-ops and on farms were damaged or destroyed as bins blew away.
 Cedar Rapids said that 60 patients were treated at local hospitals for storm- related injuries.
 The only known death in Iowa was a 63-year-old bicyclist who was hit by one of several large trees that fell on a bike path outside of Cedar Rapids. In Fort Wayne, Indiana, the storm killed a 73-year-old woman who was found clutching a young boy in her storm-battered mobile home.

NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s leader says his country has done well in containing the coronavirus pandemic and announced $1.46 trillion in infrastructure projects to boost the sagging economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Saturday in a speech to mark the 73rd anniversary of India’s independence from British rule that the key lesson India has learned from the pandemic is to become self-reliant in manufacturing and developing itself as a key supply chain destination for international companies. He said three vaccines are in different phases of testing in India and mass production will begin as soon as scientists give the green light. Modi said “detailed plans are in place for large-scale production” of a vaccine that will be made “available to every Indian.”

Eisenhower lightweight Logan Jaquay and Sharon middleweight Sully Allen are former District 10 wrestlers who helped comprise the Edinboro University wrestling team's massive 2020-21 recruiting class.
   
 They are among 25 new members to be added to the roster for the Division I Fighting Scots, according to coach Matt Hill.
   
 "We're thankful to welcome this excellent group of student-athletes to the Edinboro wrestling family," Hill said. "Each of them possesses the core values of hard work and commitment on and off the mat that we strive for daily."
   
 Jaquay is expected to initially compete at 125 or 133 pounds for the Scots. He went 140-30 over four seasons for the Knights, according to pa-wrestling.com.
   
 That stretch for Jaquay also included two top-eight medals at the PIAA Class 2A tournament.
   
 Allen verbally committed to Edinboro during his senior season at Sharon. The star for the Tigers finished 129-29 over four years, was a two-time state qualifier and a one-time state medalist.
   
 Gabe Willochell of Greater Latrobe and Luke Sainato of Gettysburg were other former PIAA wrestlers that Hill recruited.
   
 Willochell (134-28) was a three-time state medalist. The 132-pounder earned a bronze as a senior. Willochell also was a 2019 gold medalist at the prestigious Powerade Tournament in Canonsburg.
   
 Sainato (120-43) was a two-time PIAA qualifier for Gettysburg.
   
 Edinboro's recruits also included state champions Jacob Lagoa of Ashtabula, Ohio, and Ryan Burgos of Hilton, New York.

The overall prices (including agent fees and wages) for Philippe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele and Griezmann weren't simply far too high compared to what should have been spent. Those footballers were bought largely because they were shiny new toys for the board to boast about. No one at the club seems to have known precisely what to do with any of them.
 How comical it will be if Barcelona will have to pay Liverpool €5 million they can ill afford if Coutinho -- who scored two goals and set up another as a second-half substitute on Friday -- wins the Champions League, but with Bayern instead of the club that owns him. The Brazil midfielder, at Bayern, has fitted into a much more demanding climate and re-produced his Liverpool form because he's in a working environment that is rigorous, where the training ground is all-for-one-one-for-all and demands intensity. He's played 36 times for Bayern this season and scored 11 goals. Not bad.
 Griezmann, who had a clearly defined position at Atletico and for France, was bought for over €100m and then asked to re-invent himself as a left winger. More inept planning and decision-making.
 Dembele? Well, no matter how much this ultra-exciting footballer has to learn about taking care of his highly strung physique, I'd point out that Arjen Robben was widely perceived to be made of glass until, at Bayern, he was taught how to become a robust, high-performance winning machine. His injury record went from atrocious to amazing. Barcelona haven't come close to this kind of holistic resource protection with Dembele. They are, as usual, either wholly, or partially, authors of their own downfall.
 I truly believe that over the years I've addressed all these issues, and more, on these pages. Now's not the time to begin to speculate whether Messi leaves, or to where he might go.
 And in the midst of a pandemic, when every rival club will view Barcelona as sitting ducks to be asset-stripped at cheap prices or fleeced for every cent if they come looking to sign players, it's extremely hard to imagine anything positive coming out of the chaos of presidential elections being advanced from their obligatory date, next summer, to this autumn.
 Barcelona are between a rock and a hard place and, mostly, it's their own damn fault.

TECUMSEH -- With the beginning of the 2020-21 school year only weeks away, the Tecumseh Public Schools has its roadmap for how the coming school year will play out for district staff, parents and students.
   
 The board of education unanimously passed the district's COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan Monday after conducting lengthy discussions on details provided by Superintendent Rick Hilderley.
   
 Rather than the Aug. 31 start date the district originally planned for this year, the board approved moving the start date back to Sept. 8 on Hilderley's request.
   
 Hilderley reasoned that a later start date would give the district time for preparation and training as well as ensure time for supplies, such as the extra tablet computers to be delivered to the district. They were ordered for lower grades to help facilitate moving back to virtual learning, if needed.
   
 "We want to make sure that not only our staff is safe, but of course our students are safe and that we understand our own procedures," Hilderley said. "So it will give us a little bit more time to plan and prepare, make sure that we have the equipment that's delivered."
   
 The week prior to the start of school will be dedicated to professional development of teachers for the new year.
   
 Tecumseh is the only district in the county to offer three modes of education -- virtual, which involves material from Tecumseh Virtual Academy; in-person; and distance learning. In distance learning, students still participate in live classes with Tecumseh teachers, but are not present in the classroom.
   
 The district surveyed families to determine what percentage still felt uncomfortable with sending students to in-person classes. According to Hilderley, the results of the survey indicated 70% of families wanted their children to attend in-person classes, while 30% were uncomfortable with in- person classes.
   
 Parents were given a deadline of midnight Monday to sign their students up for one of the three options for the upcoming school year, and in a video to parents Tuesday, Hilderley confirmed that the enrollment matched the survey results.
   
 The survey allowed staff in the district to have an estimate of how many students to expect back in person to guide plans at creating more distance between in-person school participants.
   
 Unlike the trend towards more collaborative, group learning that required teachers to reconfigure desk arrangements to bring students close together, teachers have had to move desks apart, back to straight rows.
   
 Ben Newsome, FirstStudent transportation manager, said that buses will be disinfected on every route between loads, both morning and afternoon.
   
 Everyone on the bus will be required to wear a mask. Hand sanitizer will be available on the bus, and students will have to sanitize their hands before boarding.
   
 The board had to approve some variances from the state's recommendation. Because of guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics that states that young children touch their faces more when they're wearing a mask, the district will require those grades to only wear face masks on transportation and in common areas. The rest of the time, such as in the classrooms, mask wearing would not be required but the children will stay in their homeroom primarily throughout the day.
   
 Students in fifth through 12th grades will be required to wear masks for the entire day.
   
 Students who cannot wear masks for medical reasons would need to provide a waiver from a medical professional in the pertinent field.
   
 Hilderley also asked for a variance to the standard of keeping desks at least 6 feet apart. Instead, the district is hoping to achieve the standards of 6 feet from nose to nose.
   
 "The actual physical desk or table may not be 6 feet apart. Our goal is to space the individual students and adults in the room up to 6 feet apart," Hilderley said.
   
 Treasurer Jon Benzing said that the district needed to find a way to check temperatures of students before they enter the bus or school property.
   
 "I think one of the keys to combating this is going to be making sure we don't allow sick kids on the buses and in the schools. And I think one of the keys to doing that -- and it's working with lots of businesses and other areas is taking their temperature. So I don't know how we facilitate that with the buses, but I think before a kid gets on the bus they need to have a temperature check and I think before a kid gets in the school they have to have a temperature check," Benzing said. "I know that some of the roadmaps out there have said that the parents are responsible for this, but honestly, the parent track record for sending sick kids to school has not been good over the years."
   
 Hilderley said the the Lenawee County Health Department's recommendation for temperature checks is that parents take temperatures of their children at home before sending them to school and verify with the school district electronically or on paper if needed.
   
 "That is, really logistically, about the only way that we can cover that topic," Hilderley said. "... Bus drivers, while they're on the side of the road, their attention needs to be primarily on their mirrors, oncoming traffic and the students coming and going from the pickup site onto the bus. So it's going to be very difficult for bus drivers to be taking temperatures and then even more difficult for bus drivers to deal with a situation if a temperature is indicated."
   
 Temperatures can be rechecked at school, he said, but parents will be the first line of defense.
   
 School officials will receive email prompts to indicate if there is a problem or that a temperature check was not logged, in which case the district will conduct its own temperature check on the student.
   
 The board also discussed, but did not vote on, scheduling options for grades 7-12. Hilderley suggested that the district consider moving back to block scheduling, in order to reduce daily class changes.
   
 "The idea is that because you have to clean every time kids change class, to reduce the number of times that you have to change class. And that gives you a better shot at addressing those cleaning issues," Hilderley said.
   
 In this scenario, the schedule would be divided into two, with half of the classes being taught on one day and the other half on the next day, with longer class periods during the day. Hilderley suggested that Wednesday, should be a virtual day where students would meet online with teachers from all of their classes while giving a whole day for maintenance to do deep cleaning in the middle of the week.
   
 The board members suggested they supported the move to block scheduling if needed, but not the virtual Wednesday, which some felt would be treated as a "blowoff day" by students.
   
 Hilderley told the board that this is something he and staff at the district are still working on and that he still wanted to get more teacher input on it. The issue will be brought to the board again at its next meeting Aug. 24.
   
 A copy of the district's detailed plan can be found on its website at tps.k12.mi.us.
   
 Board member Mike McNamara was not present at the meeting.

11th Anniversary
 Reflecting on Then and Now
 By Elena Hutslar
 As we put together the 11- year anniversary issue, I reflect on what inspired us to create a monthly community newspaper more than a decade ago. It was 2009 and we had endured the Great Recession - the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble and the global financial crisis. We knew people who lost their jobs or lost their homes. Some friends and neighbors were forced to start over and find new careers and places to live. Despite the doom and gloom of the state of our country’s affairs in the media, we saw the resiliency of our community and were inspired to highlight the many organizations, individuals, and businesses that supported each other.
 2020 has hurled us into uncharted waters with unimaginable challenges, and we find ourselves in a situation of doom and gloom again. The negative stories continue to dominate our media sources and it’s a struggle to avoid them. But we all know of stories taking place in our community of support and resiliency yet again. We just have to work to hear and see them.
 As COVID struck and Shelter in Place was enacted, we saw inspirational messages and illustrations in chalk throughout the community. Citizens made masks for friends, neighbors, and strangers. Meals were purchased for essential workers. Members of the community were anxious to support local restaurants that were forced to close their dining rooms but stood in line for take out instead. Our local musicians performed on Facebook Live to lift our spirits. People created GoFundMe sites to raise money for business owners. Our police and fire departments granted birthday parade wishes. Everyone has suffered from the pandemic in different ways and levels of severity, but the community has demonstrated its compassion by supporting others as best they can.
 We have watched the sad and emotional stories unfold in the media on social injustices. But collectively, our community has demonstrated its support for one another through parades, marches for justice, and compassion to officers with messages and meals. Sadly, the negative few garner more media attention than the collective good.
 The Community Focus looks forward to a future when we can promote local community events in the Make Some Plans Calendar, highlight our school athletes, and list live music venues, but until then, we will focus on the vibrancy of our local businesses, residents, and community organizations.
 We are beyond grateful to our writers, advertisers, and readers, and we cherish Trish Heaney and Alison Clary for their dedication to the paper. We are proud and honored to focus on the strengths of our community.

 After the inner-harbour development was carried out recently to deepen the berths and also the entry and exit points, the port’s depth was increased to 12.80 metres from 10.90 metres and in the second phase, the depth will be increased to 14.50 metres. With the increase in draft, the port is inching towards handling larger vessels to transform itself into a transhipment hub.

Khartoum, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 15th Aug, 2020 ) :Egypt's prime minister arrived in Sudan on Saturday on a visit aiming to "improve cooperation" between the two neighbours, officials said, amid tensions over Ethiopia's Nile dam.
 It is Mostafa Madbouli's first official visit to Sudan since the formation of a transitional government in Khartoum in 2019.
 "The aim of this visit is to improve cooperation between the two countries in various fields," the office of Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said in a statement.
 Madbouli's delegation includes Egypt's ministers of water and irrigation, electricity, health, and trade and industry.
 The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has been a source of tension in the Nile River basin ever since Ethiopia broke ground on it in 2011.

REYNOLDSBURG — It’s time to dig in the soil, get your hands dirty, and get growing. Join the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) and Ohio State University Extension as we encourage Ohioans to create their own Victory Gardens.
 Victory Gardens originated during World War I, an answer to a severe food shortage at the time. The idea was wildly successful, growing an army of amateur gardeners and serving to boost morale and patriotism. ODA and OSU Extension are reviving the effort and once again encouraging people to plant seeds, realize the fruits of their labor, and share with others if inspired. Advice and resources on every aspect of planting and harvesting produce are available at the Ohio Victory Gardens website.
 “At a time when many people are spending more time at home with their families, we saw revitalizing the concept of Victory Gardens as an enjoyable, interactive way to learn about growing your own nutritious food that can be made into meals everyone can enjoy,” said Ohio Department of Agriculture Director Dorothy Pelanda. “This is a great way for anyone to start a new hobby and to have a little fun while learning an important life skill.”
 “We are excited to partner with ODA on the Victory Gardens program. Backyard gardens are a great way for families to teach their children where their food comes from, an opportunity to respond to the needs of local food banks, and a way to boost morale across the state,” said Cathann A. Kress, Ohio State vice president for agricultural administration and dean of the College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences. “No matter your level of gardening experience, our OSU Extension educators will provide expertise that will help your gardens thrive.”
 Need seeds to get started? Victory Garden seeds are available through six OSU Extension offices. Seed pick-up times and locations vary, see the website for specifics regarding each office: Clark County Office, Franklin County Office, Lucas County Office, Cuyahoga County Office, Hamilton County Office, Washington County Office.

“We came up with a general philosophy, and it was right from the beginning when we knew we were going to play at a neutral site,” Mayer said.
 “It’s not going to be their arena, but you could do certain things that at least give them the feeling that they’re the home team,” he added. “So, we reached out to each team individually and told them, empty the whole bucket.”
 From the Ramones’ “Blitzkrieg Bop,” to Jimmy Eat World’s “Sweetness” pounding through the PA systems, Toronto’s Scotiabank Arena has been made to resemble everyplace from Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York, to the Panthers' BB&T Center in Sunrise, Florida.
 One of the drawbacks? The “visiting” team's songs get played, too.
 “Weren’t we the home team?” Carolina forward Justin Williams wondered, referring to the New York Rangers following Carolina’s preliminary round series-opening 3-2 win. “Other than that, we had our music for a home game. We had music for warm-up.”
 Mayer noted that goal songs — home or away — maintain a level of energy in the building.
 “He’s the only that I’ve heard that has commented on it. And I find that to be pretty unbelievable actually” he said. “Now, as we get later in the rounds, do people start focusing on it a little more? Maybe. But we’ve been really happy with the reaction from the players.”
 Though players’ views are important, Mayer’s approach to game presentation is more on how the action and atmosphere translates to a television audience.
 It’s why the NHL elected to use the arena settings as more of a stage, with the focus placed on the ice. Tarping the seats in the lower bowl was an early decision made as opposed to following other sports’ leads in using cardboard cutouts of various personalities to create the illusion of fans.
