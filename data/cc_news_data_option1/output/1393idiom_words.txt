 The people in Florida who are known to be infected with the new coronavirus visited at least 46 states and traveled to every continent except Antarctica in the weeks before they tested positive for COVID-19, a USA TODAY Network- Florida analysis of state infection data found.
 Travel-related cases dominated the test results in early March when the virus was first identified in Florida. They have become a smaller share of the total number of cases as the virus spreads through communities.
 Travel-related cases continued to outnumber non-travel cases through March 19.
 But as the virus took hold around the state, non-travel cases and cases where travel history is still under investigation began growing faster. From March 20 through April 1, only 17% of Florida's COVID-19 cases involved known travel, according to the analysis.
 The USA TODAY Network-Florida analyzed the Florida Department of Health's travel data from March 2 through the morning of April 2.
