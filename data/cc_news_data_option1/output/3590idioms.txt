Kate Boyd, who was named the high performance Director of Nordiq Canada, said last week she is focused on rebuilding Olympic pathway at all levels and maintaining Paralympic excellence.


  Boyd will be first-ever woman to take the reins of Nordiq Canada's high- performance program.


  Boyd says her goals as Nordiq Canada's new high-performance director are completely clear - to get Canadian cross-country skiers back on the Olympic podium and continue the tradition of medal-winning performances in the national Para-Nordic program.


  "I am absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity to make a positive impact on the future of our sport in Canada. I believe this position comes with a responsibility to lead our athletes, staff and community at large with integrity while developing a robust high-performance Nordic skiing system focused on excellence," said Boyd, who is currently the lone female winter Para-sport coach at the national level in the country.


  "I have been surrounded by strong female leaders throughout my entire career - and while working with the Canadian Paralympic Committee, Own the Podium, and Canadian Olympic Committee - who have greatly influenced the person and leader I am today. I never felt there wasn't anything I could do because I was a woman and I am honoured to be the first female to take on the responsibility of Nordiq Canada's high-performance director."


  Building on her success of fostering depth and driving medal-winning performances for Canada's Para-Nordic program since 2015 as Nordiq Canada's NextGen coach and program coordinator, Boyd stepped up in 2018 to share high- performance manager duties with Joel Jaques.


  She brings more than two decades of leadership experience; sport development; and stakeholder engagement to her new position.


  Throughout her career while serving a variety of leadership and program management positions for organizations including YMCA-YWCA in the National Capital Region, City of Kawartha Lakes Boys and Girls Club, Nakkertok Ski Club, and Kanata Nordic Ski Club prior to joining Nordiq Canada, Boyd has led critical change that resulted in renewed trust, credibility and sustained financial viability while working with administrators, athletes and coaches from the club and provincial  levels to the nation's best.


  "Kate is a highly-motivated professional who knows what it takes for athletes and coaches to reach their full potential, and ultimately, win," said Stephane Barrette, interim chief executive officer, Nordiq Canada. "She has a keen understanding of program management, our development pathway from the grassroots to elite level, and the sport system in Canada, which will provide a relatively seamless transition to this new role. Kate understands the patience and time investment required to build a medal-winning program. I am confident her experience will result in Canadian athletes and coaches excelling on the world stage at all levels."


  In an effort to regain the Canadian identity of cross-country skiing in Canada, Boyd is determined to develop a coach-driven, athlete-focused program in Canada that is accountable and reliable with a determination to excel at all levels.


  "Working with our entire team of dedicated staff, my first priority is to get fully up to speed with our Olympic stream to gain as much clarity with that program as I currently have with the Para-Nordic stream," said Boyd.


  "With the global pandemic very much still a challenge for all of us in the world, I am also committed to ensuring our athletes and staff have the resources they require to train and have the opportunity to get on a start line, and race, while staying healthy.


  "There is no doubt we have challenging days ahead of us, but I'm here for the long haul. Together with our sport partners, staff at Nordiq Canada and our coaches, we will be relentless in our collaborative pursuit of developing this program from the ground up, and making cross-country skiing in Canada a winner."


  A registered professional coach who has worked with cross-country skiers at all levels, Boyd has led teams while also providing coaching support at the 2018 Paralympic Winter Games, along with multiple World Championship and World Cup events.


  Boyd was recently selected to participate on Canada's 27-member COVID-19 Return To Sport Task Force led by Own the Podium. She currently lives in Canmore, where she will continue to work out of Nordiq Canada's head office.

Meg Ryan can feel it. September is going to be the month things turn around for her business.


   


  Ryan, owner of Power Up Nutrition in uptown Shelby, has for months been feeling the sting of a summer hamstrung by constant construction and a national pandemic.


   


  "Between COVID and the construction, things have definitely slowed down," said Ryan. "Our numbers are much lower than what they were (in March). There's just not as much foot traffic."


   


  For eight years Ryan's business, which specializes in healthy smoothies and energy teas, has been open in uptown. It closed for the entire month of April when the state started imposing restrictions on businesses in response to the coronavirus.


   


  Since reopening Ryan said she's lost just shy of one-third of her business from pre-pandemic, but she believes the conditions are right for an upswing in business.


   


  "This is it. Everybody is getting back into a routine again, everybody is familiar with what is expectant of them, and they aren't afraid to leave anymore," she said. "People are going to be out walking and trying to be more active since they've been so confined, and it has been so hot."


   


  In anticipation of a return to crowds in uptown, Ryan is extending her business hours in September, giving folks out and about after work a chance to stop in.


   


  While some are still feeling the burden of months of reduced business, some hard work and difficult choices allowed Jan's Restaurant in Fallston a chance to stay strong through the summer.


   


  "That first month or so when everything was closed, that was a hard month. We still had plenty of business and I'm thankful for that, but it is hard not knowing what the next day was going to be like," said Amanda McLeymore, who owns the restaurant. "I am thankful and blessed for our customers for making sure we got to stay open this whole time."


   


  McLeymore said she used her own cash to keep the business open and employees paid during the first several weeks of the pandemic.


   


  She also took steps to implement a curbside pickup option for folks looking for something to eat.


   


  "A lot of our customers are older, and initially they were afraid to come get something to eat. I tried to make things as easy and as comfortable for them as possible which really helped," she said.


   


  Like most other restaurants operating in Phase 2 of the state reopening plan, Jans is back open to the public at 50 percent capacity. Customers are kept distanced from each other and asked to wear masks unless they are sitting down to eat.


   


  Two months into the new structure and McLeymore said Jans is "as strong as ever," though dine-in services have dropped off some.


   


  "Most people are still hesitant to eat inside and are still getting food to go," she said. "When all this first happened everybody was mad. Now that we are in it, people understand this is just what we have to do."

Royal Caribbean reported second-quarter 2020 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues surpassed the same. While the top line beat the consensus mark after missing in the preceding three quarters, the bottom line missed the same for the second straight quarter. Moreover, both the metrics declined sharply year over year due to the coronavirus pandemic.      The company reported adjusted loss per share of $6.13, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $4.71. In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.54 per share.      Total revenues were $175.6 million, beating the consensus mark of $52 million. However, the figure declined 93.7% from the year-ago quarter. Due to the pandemic, the company suspended its global cruise operation beginning Mar 13, 2020, which resulted in the cancellation of all of the company's second- quarter sailings.      During suspension of operations, the company anticipates cash burn in the range of nearly $250 million to $290 million per month.

"At this time, we do not have any evidence or information that our three homicides that have occurred in the past two weeks are related," Valdosta Police Chief Leslie Manahan said in a statement.


  Johnnie Malachi, a 19-year-old Valdosta resident, was shot and killed outside of a Bemiss Road business in the early morning hours of Sunday, Aug. 30. Authorities are looking for a suspect.


  Lawrence Franklin, 21, of Valdosta was pronounced dead at South Georgia Medical Center Monday, Sept. 7, after police found him on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive with a gunshot wound to the torso, authorities reported. At 3:24 a.m. Monday, police responded to 911 reports of a person being shot outside of a business on the 100 block of West Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Police are looking for a suspect.


  Both of the earlier cases occurred in business parking lots and dozens of people left the scenes as police arrived.


  Anyone with any information on these cases should contact the Valdosta Police Department Bureau of Investigations, (229) 293-3145; or the Crime Tip Line, (229) 293-3091.

The 20-year-old, who made his debut last season and played in the EFL Trophy, FA Cup and in League One, has put pen-to-paper on a deal until 2022, with his previous terms due to expire next summer.


  The midfielder, who operates similarly to Town veteran Cole Skuse, has been with the Town senior squad throughout pre-season but has not yet been given a squad number for the new campaign.


  The 20-year-old has four Town appearances to his name and has had loan spells with Bury Town and Concord Rangers in the past, as well as being heavily involved with Town U23s over the past two seasons.


  With significant midfield traffic between him and regular first-team football in Suffolk, a loan move is possible as McGavin looks to stake a claim.


  “He needs men’s football, U23s football, and this is just my opinion, U23s football isn’t teaching them anything,” manager Paul Lambert said of McGavin earlier this year.


  “It’s not teaching them the right ways of football, it’s not teaching them physicality, it’s not teaching them streetwise football, it’s not teaching them the real game.


  “The real game is a country mile away from U23 football and I think that’s where it’s lost and that’s why I think Brett and people like that need to go and play men’s football.”

“Rage” includes the first-reported excerpts of letters Trump exchanged with Kim, and quotes Trump in his interviews with Woodward using expletives to defend their pen-pal relationship. Even as U.S. intelligence chiefs warn that North Korea is unlikely to ever surrender its nuclear weapons and that Trump’s approach is ineffective, the president told Woodward he is determined to stay the course and dismissively says the CIA has “no idea” how to handle North Korea.


  “I met. Big fucking deal,” Trump told Woodward, waving off criticism of his three face-to-face meetings with Kim. “It takes me two days. I met. I gave up nothing.”


  Foreign affairs experts say Trump gave up much — including by postponing and then scaling back the U.S. joint military exercises with South Korea that had long angered North Korea, as well as by granting Kim the international stature and legitimacy the North Korean regime has long craved.


  Trump told Woodward he evaluates Kim and his nuclear arsenal like a real estate target: “It’s really like, you know, somebody that’s in love with a house and they just can’t sell it.”

That _Mulan_ is the trial balloon for this release as opposed to, say, _Black Widow_ — to name another derailed Disney release — is suspect and another weight on the back of an already overburdened film. _Mulan_ feels extraordinarily compromised, something only bolstered by calls for a boycott over star Liu Yifei’s support of the Hong Kong police department’s violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests. The movie itself feels like an anticlimax: _Mulan_ is merely a serviceable film that’s rather easy to forget. It does not live up to the expectations placed on it, nor does it make a compelling argument against its earliest critics. It’s a movie mostly noticeable for what isn’t there. If you can shut that out, what’s on-screen is often gorgeous to look at.

Stark also ordered the unsealing of letters attorneys for Xcoal had filed with the court on Aug. 31 and Sept. 2 in response to the letter, saying Xcoal “has not even attempted” to meet its burden of showing why the letters should be withheld from public view.


  An attorney for Xcoal told Stark on Aug. 25 that the circumstances surrounding the letter were “unbelievably coincidental,” and it looked like “a total setup” by people trying to falsely attribute things to Thrasher.


  Attorneys for the Justice companies meanwhile sought a 45-day postponement of the trial to conduct additional discovery. Attorneys for Xcoal joined in the request with “great reluctance,” but later changed their minds.


  Stark noted Tuesday that attorneys for the Justice companies already have deposed witnesses including Thrasher and Taylor and have taken other discovery involving their suspicions that Xcoal had not acted in good faith and had conspired with the testing lab. Stark said the letter contained no established facts that might merit additional information gathering, but only “unproven, anonymous allegations.” He noted that while the allegations might be “entirely true,” they could also be “entirely false” and fabricated by someone seeking to disrupt the trial.

CHICAGO — Within hours of closing for the pandemic, the staff at Chicago’s Hyde Park Art Center switched their focus to creating online content.


  When the pandemic closed community spaces in March, art classes had to scramble to ensure students had quality instruction, now without hands-on teaching. Mike Nourse, the director of education at Hyde Park Art Center said its digital transition was a success.


  “When we started the virtual classes it was a way to keep our current student base engaged. I think we were surprised at how many more students we’ve had join who have never used clay,” said Nourse. Using Google Meet, the Hyde Park Art Center hosts courses on drawing, ceramic and more. He said instructors faced a learning curve. The staff hosted workshops to bridge the technical gap. Nourse said the staff learned from the workshops too.


  “It was a curveball for people who relied their whole careers on in-person teaching,” said Nourse. “We told our teachers early on, none of our staff has done this before. We’ve been very open with our communication. It’s a shared process.”


  At Lillstreet Art Center, Jessie LaMacchia, director of marketing and outreach, said its teachers have an overhead camera so students can learn techniques. The center teaches drawing, ceramics and other art forms. LaMacchia said the classes are still better than a recorded session.


  “Just like in a regular class, if students are struggling or have any questions, teachers are able to provide one-on-one help,” LaMacchia said. “That’s the benefit of live instruction versus watching a video tutorial online.”


  Chris Busse, co-owner of Penguin Foot Pottery in Wicker Park, said instructing people online has been an adjustment. Because clay is so malleable, it’s easier for a teacher to help fix any issues in person. Penguin Foot instructors ask people to hold their clay close to the camera to show how they’re doing.


  Penguin Pottery, Lillstreet Art Center and Sip and Paint Chicago in Jefferson Park have created kits for their classes, small packages containing essential materials, and contactless pickup. And whatever studios can’t provide, teachers attempt to work around.


  “We designed all of our lessons to work around using common household objects, like butter knives and forks, things folks will have lying around,” Busse said. “Luckily with clay, hands are the biggest tool you need.”


  Although Sip and Paint is hosting small, in-person events, owner Lily Miteva said there’s nothing like a full house. “The instructor and I worked off the people’s energy,” she said. “We miss walking around in the studio, giving tips or offering advice.”


  LaMacchia said although she wishes it was safe for customers to come in, online classes have taught the studio a lot. I think the biggest take away from online classes is just to be flexible in thinking about how and what you teach,” LaMacchia said. “How can we utilize everyday tools that students have in their home so they don’t have to sink a fortune into supplies to participate in our classes? What new techniques can we add that are more appropriate for in-home work?”


  At Hyde Park, Nourse said some courses like ceramic and printmaking classes have in-person sessions in small groups now that the center has reopened. Other classes will stay virtual for the time being, and possibly even after the pandemic. “This isn’t a quick fix,” Nourse said. “This will stay with us for the long haul.”

CLYDE EDWARDS-HELAIRE, Chiefs


  One of the few rookie RBs with a starting role, Edwards-Helaire faces the Texans in Week 1 in what is our third-best matchup for RBs. The Chiefs put up 51 points on Houston in the AFC championship game in January, and RBs were responsible for three of those TDs. Darrel Williams will be in the mix somewhere, but he’s been running with the second team all camp and he’s being used primarily as a passing down back so Edwards-Helaire will see most goal- line carries. Once the Chiefs passed on Leonard Fournette, it was all systems go for the rookie in KC.


  JOSH JACOBS, Raiders


  Jacobs only scored seven TDs in 2019 as the Raiders main running back, but that had more to do with the Raiders throwing the ball a third of the time in the red zone — mostly to TE Darren Waller. In his Week 1 matchup with the Panthers though, Jacobs gets an excellent matchup for RBs in the entire league as Carolina gave up 27 TDs to RBs in 2019. Just for reference, the next- closest teams gave up 18. The Panthers actually cover TEs better than they cover RBs and WRs, so that just bolsters Jacobs chances of reaching the end zone.

Wyatt Teller playfully refers to his no-frills garage training sessions as "Eastern European" workouts.


   


  No state-of-the-art gyms.


   


  No heat in the winter.


   


  No air conditioning in the summer.


   


  Teller figures "all those strong man competition guys who just look like bowling balls" are steeled in rough, bare-bones environments.


   


  Think of Rocky Balboa venturing into the Russian wilderness to prepare for his fight against Ivan Drago.


   


  "I'm not fighting Drago, luckily," Teller quipped. "But I have to block Myles [Garrett] all camp whenever he decides to come inside, so basically Drago, but a little different."


   


  Anyway, you get the point.


   


  The COVID-19 pandemic forced Teller and many other players throughout the NFL into home weight rooms. He just happened to thrive during an unprecedented offseason, then run away with the Browns' starting right guard job.


   


  In the buildup to training camp, right guard had been billed as an open competition, one of the team's few legitimate battles for a starting job. That wasn't merely speculation, either. In May, offensive line coach Bill Callahan said the position was "up for grabs," and he listed Teller, Drew Forbes, Colby Gossett and Willie Wright as candidates.


   


  But Forbes and Gossett opted out of the 2020 season due to coronavirus concerns a couple of weeks before the Browns took the field in camp. Wright never posed a serious threat and was waived Saturday in the cut to a 53-man roster. Rookie fifth-round draft pick Nick Harris didn't become a factor, either, and couldn't because he was busy filling in for starting center JC Tretter, who had knee surgery on Aug. 13, the day before the first full-squad practice of camp. Chris Hubbard stayed at tackle instead of moving to guard, a position he played during his days with the Pittsburgh Steelers.


   


  And Teller seized his opportunity to retain the starting right guard job he held with the Browns for the final nine games of the 2019 season. In camp, he went wire to wire in the role.


   


  "I knew there was going to be competition," Teller said last week in a phone interview with the Beacon Journal. "I didn't expect the two guys that were the immediate competition to opt out, but that was their choice, and they have to take care of their family.


   


  "With that being said, I didn't know that until right before camp, so that didn't even matter to me, and I wasn't even thinking like that to begin with. It was, 'How am I going to help my team out regardless of if I'm a first-team or second-team guy?' And that is being as strong, as fast and as smart as possible coming into camp."


   


  Finding a routine


   


  Teller, 25, has been a member of the Browns for a little more than a year. After he started the final seven games of the 2018 season at left guard as a rookie fifth-round draft pick with the Buffalo Bills, former Browns General Manager John Dorsey traded for him on Aug. 29, 2019. Dorsey sent a selection in the fifth round and another in the sixth round of the 2020 draft to the Bills in exchange for Teller and a 2021 seventh-round choice.


   


  But with Andrew Berry replacing Dorsey as GM in January, Teller knew a future with the Browns wasn't guaranteed.


   


  "This year, I was hell-bent on not leaving Cleveland," Teller said. "I want to be here, so I was going to work my butt off [and do] whatever it took to stay here."


   


  When last season ended, Teller gave his body two weeks to recover, then resumed strength and conditioning work. He took only two more weeks off before reporting to camp in late July. By the time he returned to Browns headquarters, he had gained 16 pounds of lean muscle and lost three pounds of fat, weighing in at 315 after finishing the 2019 season at 302.


   


  Teller, 6-foot-4½, plans on playing this year between 315-320 pounds and said he hopes to provide the Browns with "an enforcer" as well as a long-term solution at his position.


   


  "[I want to be] consistent and reliable at right guard for the foreseeable future," Teller said. "That's always my dream. That's the next step -- to be that guy for a while. Obviously, I only have two years on my contract, but God willing I stay."


   


  Teller's offseason training regimen began at Virginia Tech, where he started 43 games at left guard and earned a degree in property management. But as February turned to March and the pandemic swept the United States, Teller resorted to the garage and got his "best Eastern European going" with help from Ryan Shuman, a member of Virginia Tech's strength and conditioning staff. A former Hokies offensive lineman, Shuman borrowed equipment from Fork Union Military Academy, where his father, John, is the director of athletics and had a legendary career as postgraduate head football coach.


   


  Lifting heavy objects wasn't the extent of Teller's mission. He credits his girlfriend, Carly Whiting, a fellow native of Virginia, for frequently stocking up on groceries and cooking to help him maintain a clean diet. His new routine also included going to bed and waking up earlier.


   


  Quality time


   


  On June 1, Teller left his offseason home in Roanoke, Virginia, and returned to Northeast Ohio. The garage of Browns two-time Pro Bowl left guard Joel Bitonio became Teller's new hangout. It's where Teller, Bitonio and Tretter trained together for about seven weeks preceding camp.


   


  "Wyatt worked his butt off this offseason," Bitonio said last week on Zoom. "He was truly focused. He wanted to help transform his body a little bit and just be ready to play. He's had some chances his first two years in the league, and he's been on a couple different teams. But he understood this right guard spot was going to be a competition, and he wanted to work for it.


   


  "I think he's done a great job of really putting himself in a position to be successful this year, and I know he's really put in the work, especially this offseason and training camp, to try and give himself the best chance."


   


  As they geared up for camp, Teller and Bitonio experimented with offensive line footwork and hand placement.


   


  "It pushed me seeing how Joel moves," Teller said. "Joel's about as athletic as it gets, so it's hard to replicate everything he does, but trying to do things and seeing how he attacks the technique and the fundamentals was a wealth of knowledge and definitely helped me be ready for the first day of camp."


   


  When Teller arrived in Berea, he reunited with Callahan, who had been guiding the offensive line meetings throughout the Browns' virtual offseason program. Prior to the 2018 draft, Teller participated in the Washington Football Team's local prospect workout day. At the time, Callahan was the team's offensive line coach. They have gotten to know each other much better since coach Kevin Stefanski hired Callahan in January.


   


  "Wyatt has worked extremely hard like the rest of the offensive linemen," Stefanski said Monday on Zoom. "If you were out there at practice, you saw Coach Callahan putting them through the paces there in their individual drills. Wyatt, in particular, really, I think, enjoys the extra work. The horn goes [off] and guys are walking in, and he's staying out to get the extra work. He's buying into the techniques. Really pleased with the camp he had."


   


  Teller called Callahan "a stickler on technique and fundamentals" and explained he has gained confidence as he's become increasingly comfortable with the veteran coach's methods. Consistency is paramount in the wide zone blocking scheme Stefanski brought to the Browns.


   


  "[Callahan] is like, 'Look, if it's lacking, we're going to do it 100 times until it's not lacking, until it becomes natural.' So that's his mentality. That's his mindset," Teller said. "He's one of the best offensive line coaches in the league. That's hands down."


   


  Right tackle Jack Conklin is another invaluable resource for Teller.


   


  "He's a great guy," Conklin told the Beacon Journal recently by phone. "He talks a lot. He always has something to say, and he always wants to be a part of everything, which is fun to have next to you. I think what stems from a lot of the talking is he's just trying to figure it out and learn a lot. It's great to have that personality next to you.


   


  "He has all the tools to do great in this offense, and he's a big guy and he moves well. He's going to be doing a great job of helping me in the run game when we have double teams. I'm very excited about the opportunity he has and the ability he has to become even better."

"For us we still have to try to keep it level, we still have to try and play a better game of cricket than we did in the semi-final," said Pollard.


  "You can't doubt yourself at this point in time. We have played fantastic cricket throughout the entire tournament and we need to have that cherry on top of it.


  "I know the guys aren't over-confident - you're seeing guys in the dressing room who want to come out and perform and prove each and every time.


  "We have the hunger to do that one more time. Hopefully we can go all the way and if we can do that, it will be unprecedented."


  Left-arm spinner Akeal Hosein set the tone for Trinbago in their semi-final win, bowling Jermaine Blackwood for a duck on his way to figures of 3-14 - Jamaica unable to recover from 25-4.


  The 27-year-old's nine tournament scalps put him just two behind Knight Riders' leading wicket-taker, Australia's Fawad Ahmed, and Pollard says Hosein has a big all-round part to play in the final.


  "Sometimes you just need to sit back and watch these guys. Akeal has been around for a long time and it's good to see these guys using their talent and coming out and showing you what they can do.


  "He didn't start the tournament and would have been dejected but knowing full well what his role is, he's come in and taken his opportunity, and he continues to improve with each and every game.


  "We haven't seen the other side of him, which is his batting - I think he's a better batsman than he is a bowler! We have these types of cricketers in the Caribbean, it's just a matter of giving them the exposure."


  Pollard has led from the front, blasting 20 sixes in the tournament on his way to 207 runs at 51.75, while Darren Bravo (239), New Zealand's Colin Munro (207) and Lendl Simmons have also passed the 200-run mark.


  St Lucia Zouks - who finished third in the table with six victories - aren't short of firepower with Royston Chase (203 runs) and Afghanistan's Najibullah Zadran (200) leading the way.


  But it was the bowlers who stole the show in the semi-final as St Lucia booked their place in the final with a crushing 10-wicket rout of Guyana Amazon Warriors - winning with 93 balls in the bank.

Activists notched a win this week after a judge rescinded a ban on protests and demonstrations at the Gaston County Courthouse.


   


  Gaston County Resident Chief District Court Judge John Greenlee said Tuesday an order signed last month that banned all expressive conduct within 300 feet of the Gaston County Courthouse and Magistrate's Office has been lifted.


   


  Greenlee said the decision was made, in part, after a protest held on the sidewalk in front of the courthouse on Friday was orderly and failed to cause disruptions for people entering and exiting the courthouse.


   


  "For the first time on Friday I was able to watch a protest during the day," Greenlee said Tuesday. "Before I'd only been able to see TV coverage of the ones that had happened at night. What I saw on Friday afternoon was peaceful and no one was impeding or interfering with anybody trying to enter the courthouse. After that I spoke at length with (Gaston County Superior Court Judge Jesse Caldwell) and we came to the conclusion the just thing to do at this time was to rescind the order. Hopefully it's something we won't have to address again."


   


  Ashley Rivera, a founding member of the Gaston County Freedom Fighters, said Tuesday she views the situation as a win for freedom of speech.


   


  "When I first heard the order had been lifted, I was filled with emotions," Rivera said. "At the end of the day it's a victory, a small one but I'm also conflicted since the order should have never been signed in the first place."


   


  Rivera was among a small group of protesters carrying signs, flags and bullhorns who openly challenged the ban on Friday. No action was taken against the group.


   


  The order went into effect Aug. 3, after it was signed by Greenlee and Caldwell, but only became known publicly after the order was delivered last week to a small group of protesters demonstrating near Gaston County's Confederate monument.


   


  The order drew criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, which compared it to a similar order in Alamance County that a judge had recently blocked officials from enforcing.


   


  Greenlee said Tuesday that court decision played a factor in rescinding the Gaston County order.


   


  "I'm happy and relieved the system came around to the right decision," Rivera said. "It shows they're listening."


   


  The Gaston County Courthouse, and the century old Confederate monument that stands before it, has been at the center of protests for months.


   


  The Gaston County Board of Commissioners voted last month to give the monument to Sons of Confederate Veterans but that plan fell through when the group declined to take ownership of the monument.


   


  Commissioners then voted 4-3 on Aug. 25 to keep the monument where it stands. Commissioners Tracy Philbeck, Allen Fraley, Jack Brown and Chad Brown voted with the majority.


   


  Commissioners Ron Hovis, Tom Keigher and Ronnie Worley supported another proposal that would have stated the county's intent to move the monument.

A start-up home builder in the UK plans to build carbon zero homes. The first steps are designing and building homes that cut down on the need to substantial heating and cooling but using better insulation options. South Africans may not use double glazing much, but they do go a long way to retain heat in winter and prevent major heating in summer. For the rest of the heating and cooling boreholes are used, not as a source of water but heat and in summer to act as a heat sink. Sensors in the home connected to smart fans would be able to automatically switch on and off to maintain a comfortable temperature. Rather than high energy use heaters or even the much more efficient air conditioners, a heat exchange pump and the fans can take care of it.

Woodward describes Coats’s experience as especially tortured. Coats, a former senator from Indiana, was recruited into the administration by Vice President Pence, and his wife is quoted as recalling a dinner at the White House when she interacted with Pence.


  “I just looked at him, like, how are you stomaching this?” Marsha Coats said, according to Woodward. “I just looked at him like, this is horrible. I mean, we made eye contact. I think he understood. And he just whispered in my ear, ‘Stay the course.’ ”


  Pence was the president’s one constant booster publicly and privately in Woodward’s book. When Coats considered resigning because of Trump’s handling of Russia, Pence urged him to “look on the positive side of things that he’s done. More attention on that. You can’t go.”


  The loathing was mutual. “Not to mention my fucking generals are a bunch of pussies. They care more about their alliances than they do about trade deals,” Trump told White House trade adviser Peter Navarro at one point, according to Woodward.

The coronavirus pandemic is intruding on yet another Minnesota tradition: deer season.
 In just over two weeks, Minnesota’s archery deer season is scheduled to begin. And as preparations for the fall hunting season ramp up, some local butchers and meat markets, which often spend their autumns processing deer into venison, might have to turn their game customers away.
 Many processors are already operating at full capacity — a ripple effect of COVID-19 closures at major pork and beef processors this spring.
 George’s City Meats in Nicollet has been around for more than four decades. During all those years in the meat processing business, Angie Langel said, the family-run shop has never experienced the type of demand they have this summer.
 They’re working nonstop, said Langel, a granddaughter of founder George Poehler, who helps run the shop. And there’s no sign of slowing. They’ve got hogs and cattle scheduled to be processed well into next year.
 “It’s a little overwhelming to think that a year from now we’re already having animals booked,” she said. “That’s a little scary to think of it that way. If something happens, then what do we do? It’s nice to know we have a steady income and we have plenty of customers coming in. But it’s also really overwhelming.”
 So as the staff at George’s works through on their glut of orders this summer, deer season is on the back of their minds. Dawn Gens, Poehler’s daughter, who also helps run and works at the shop, said she’s taking things day by day.
 Usually, by fall, they’re able to pivot some of their production toward venison as hunting season kicks into high gear. This year, she’s not so sure.
 “We’re booked out for a year,” Gens said. “I’m butchering beef and hogs. We’re just focused, so we don’t know about deer yet.”
 Gens said she hopes they’ll be able to bring on some outside help to break down deer, so they can still process sausage at the shop. But she can’t say for sure how the fall will pan out.
 The COVID-19 pandemic’s effects have rippled through communities and industries across Minnesota in different ways. When outbreaks temporarily shuttered several meat processing plants, including Worthington’s JBS USA pork processing plant and Sioux Falls, S.D.’s Smithfield Foods production facility, it left producers — and consumers — in limbo.
 Farmers were left needing places to process livestock they weren’t able to move onto market. Large retailers, like Walmart, experienced meat shortages, leading a surge of customers searching for new sources. Both turned their sights on local meat processors and markets.
 That’s exactly what happened at the Buffalo Ridge Locker in the small town of Ruthton, Minn., in Pipestone County. When the huge Smithfield plant across state lines announced it would put its operations on hold, Buffalo Ridge was flooded with phone calls, and requests to process hogs and cattle.
 Andy Schellhaas is co-owner of Buffalo Ridge Locker, and his family has owned the business for 39 years. He said this level of demand is unprecedented. Buffalo Ridge, he said, is booked for domestic livestock processing out until May 2021 — and summer 2021 is filling quickly.
 Schellhaas said he’s hearing similar stories from his peers at meat processors and butchers in other parts of the state,
 “Everyone had taken on as much as they could,” he said. “It’s safe to say there’s quite a few lockers in this situation. I’ve even heard that some people from even up north are even reaching out down here saying, ‘are you taking processing right now?’”
 Two weeks ahead of deer season, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is already hearing stories of hunters having trouble finding processors. But officials say it’s too early to tell if the backlog of processing domestic livestock will deter hunters or have an effect on the number of permit applications this fall.
 Barbara Keller, the DNR’s big game program leader, said that while many processors are experiencing the ripple effects of the pandemic, some are still to take game this season — it just means that hunters will need to be proactive in their planning.
 “We are anticipating that we need to get the word out to hunters, because certainly it could have an impact on hunters’ willingness to take additional deer, if they don’t have a resource where they can get that deer processed,” Keller said.
 “We’re optimistic that it won’t have a significant impact, but it’s hard to say that kind of this early on. It is a dynamic situation.”
 Over the past few months, George’s City Meats has built up a new clientele from farmers in a processing pinch and consumers looking for local meat — some from as far as the Twin Cities.
 Typically, Langle said, they would also see a reliable stream of hunters in the fall. But she’s worried about what all that new business will mean for George’s regulars.
 “We’re feeling bad that those are the people we’re trying to squeeze in somewhere, but because we have all these new people trying to find a new place, that we’re having a hard time keeping them separate and keeping everyone happy, so to speak,” Langle said.
 “It’s been a challenge. Deer hunters basically come one time a year, and that hasn’t changed. But, now those are the people that are trying to get in and we’re already booked with other animals.”
 An avid hunter himself, Schellhaas said he doesn’t think others will be discouraged from hunting this season because of the potential obstacle. He just hopes they’re willing to be flexible with the fluid situation.
 “Just be ready because it could always change,” he said. “It could all be different. We don’t know the future and we just plan one day ahead like everyone else. We want people to hunt. We want everybody to still do those things and not be deterred by it. But, just be ready. You might have to do it yourself.”

Water mains in the Shiawassee Road-area have been found to be problematic, leading officials to abandon 2 of them. A 4-inch main that runs down Shiawassee, under Department of Environment, Great Lakes & Energy rules, must be abandoned due to its small size. There is a 12-inch main that runs down the road that the majority of homes were thought to be tapped into, but in fact, most were connected to the smaller one. Those will now be connected to the larger main, which will also have new valves added between Fenway Drive and Adelaide Street. Insertion valves will be used to prevent any interruption of service. On nearby George Street, it was discovered that 5 homes are connected to 2-inch galvanized pipe. This pipe is considered to be a lead service line and will be abandoned in favor of an 8-inch main with service lines being replaced. Under new lead and copper rules, the responsibility for these costs fall with the city, and not homeowners.

The judge gave the corrections department a couple of months to come up with a plan for using the body cameras and surveillance cameras at all critical areas of the prison. All footage would be retained for a minimum of 90 days, with videos of “use of force and other triggering events involving class members at RJD [to] be retained indefinitely”


  In court papers, the judge noted that the corrections department argued that body cameras are not as useful in prison as surveillance cameras and that it would take far longer to get them up and running.


  “The court finds the body cameras are likely to improve investigations of misconduct by RJD staff,” the ruling stated.


  The prison has had other recent issues. Last month, seven correctional officers were hospitalized after being attacked by 20 inmates. An associate warden subsequently quit, saying prison leadership had allowed no pat-downs on the yard to reduce conflict.

Rose Maria Patterson was known to call daily, so Michael Thomasson didn't hesitate that summer day in 2015 when he hit the reject button on his cell phone, thinking he'd call his mother back later.


   


  "She called every day, all day, every day," Thomasson said. "I figured, 'Ok, I'll just call her back later on.'"


   


  But later would never come and now, five years after Patterson's disappearance from the streets of Gastonia, Thomasson continues to struggle with the decision to ignore his mother's call.


   


  "It eats me alive, every single day, because it's one of those 'what ifs.' What if I would have answered? I might have been able to save her life."


   


  Patterson was reported missing to the Gastonia Police Department on Sept. 2, 2015, after her son had not been able to make contact with her for a month.


   


  Patterson, who was 43 years old at the time of her disappearance, was known to be in the area of U.S. 321 South in Gastonia, particularly near Clyde Street and Johns Lane, but also had associates throughout Gastonia, as well as in Dallas and Matthews, Gastonia Police said.


   


  It's been some 2,000 days since Thomasson last heard his mother's voice. There have been few leads in her case and he says he's prepared himself for the fact that his mother is more than likely dead.


   


  "After five years, I'm automatically assuming she's gone. It ain't gonna do much more damage to me emotionally than what's already been done."


   


  Patterson gave birth to her son in Gastonia in September 1990. He's the oldest of her four children as he has two brothers and a sister. But it was Michael's maternal grandmother who raised him. Substance abuse was Patterson's demon.


   


  "There was a huge substance abuse with crack cocaine," Michael said of his mother, who served eight months in prison in 2011 for drug possession and had prior convictions for drug paraphernalia and larceny.


   


  Patterson had continued to stay in Gaston County and had a steady boyfriend whom she lived with for a number of years, but in the summer of 2014, her boyfriend died. She soon found herself homeless and back among the drug culture.


   


  "All her life she struggled," Thomasson said.


   


  Despite her own struggles, Patterson would make daily phone calls to her son and his wife, who were living in Greenville, South Carolina, at the time. She loved her granddaughters and would always ask to speak to them, sometimes calling three to four times a day. She'd ask that they call her at night, so she could hear them as they said their bedside prayers.


   


  "She had a really close connection with our kids and she would call every day to talk to them. She just loved to call and talk all the time," said Abigail Thomasson, who said she had a good relationship with her mother-in-law.


   


  Michael said that's the kind of person his mother was.


   


  "My mother would give you the shirt off her back if it came down to it. People would take my momma for granted a lot. She's like me, kind-hearted," he said.


   


  In the summer of 2015, Patterson and her son's relationship had begun to heal and the Thomassons asked that she move to South Carolina and live with them. She finally relented and made plans to make the move, telling her son and daughter-in-law that a man named Chris was going to give her a ride south.


   


  "As the years went by, we got together and kind of reconciled a little bit and moved forward with our life," Michael said. "She was supposed to be moving here with me to get away from North Carolina and everything down there."


   


  A few days later, Michael received a phone call from his mother's phone. But, as noted before, he rejected the call. He says he forgot to call her back. A few weeks later his aunt asked him when was the last time he'd spoken to his mother. He constantly called his mother. Each time, his call would go to her voice mail unanswered. On Sept. 2, 2015, Michael contacted the Gastonia Police Department and reported that his mother was missing.


   


  Michael has had his own issues with drugs in the past.


   


  In 2012, he was arrested in South Carolina and charged with making and distributing methamphetamine. He served eight months in prison, two years of house arrest and five years of probation. Thomasson was under house arrest when he filed the missing person's report on his mother.


   


  "I've had a rough life growing up, too," he said, "but I've been clean eight years. I struggle from time to time, but life is a struggle, I guess."


   


  Because of his past, Michael admits to "a big lack of respect for authority."


   


  "That's just the way I was always raised. Police, don't like 'em. But I can't hate them because they're doing their job."


   


  In the early stages of the investigation, the Thomassons said they had little communication from police detectives. They said their calls went to voice mail and were never returned.


   


  "Every once in a while, somebody would call back and say, 'Oh, we've been really busy and haven't had time to look into anything,'" Abigail said.


   


  More delays followed as the case was transferred to another detective, but, according to the Thomassons, the same pattern followed: no callbacks or if detectives did call back, there was little to report.


   


  In August, with the five-year anniversary of Patterson's disappearance near, Abigail called and spoke with Sgt. Adrienne Walker-Hall. She agreed to review the case and soon assigned it to detective Carla Mastro, who has been in contact with the Thomassons.


   


  "They've been great, but it's kind of a shame it's taken five years for us to finally see some movement on it," Abigail said. "We're praying that something will finally come from it."


   


  They both believe drugs may have played a part in Patterson's disappearance and Michael's asked that police make a family member take a lie detector test. He believes the person, who he says "hated" his mother, may have played a part in Patterson's disappearance or knows something about it.


   


  Michael's also haunted by the unanswered phone call.


   


  "If I would have answered the phone… it might have been a cry for help because she needed money to pay off a drug debt. And I'd a done it."


   


  Michael, who now lives in Taylors, South Carolina, with his family, has offered to travel to Gastonia and supply DNA so police could compare that against any unidentified remains.


   


  "All I want is the truth," he said. "If anybody's got the heart to come forward and say something about anything instead of trying to take it to the grave with them, just come forward with it."


   


  The last time Michael had seen his mother was on March 29, 2014, when she attended his and Abigail's wedding. He is glad they had started to mend their fractured relationship.


   


  "The last few years that we spent together, we actually talked, worked things out," Michael said. "There wasn't nothing I wouldn't do for my momma and there wasn't nothing my momma wouldn't do for me."


   


  Patterson still doesn't know she has another grandchild, a boy, who was born after her disappearance. Abigail said it's tough to talk to their three daughters and son about their missing grandmother.


   


  "They ask, 'Where's Nana? Have they found Nana yet?' And the only thing we can tell them is, 'No,'" she said.


   


  "At this point, as sad as it is, the thought is there that she's probably no longer with us. At this point, we're probably just looking for closure and finding some remains. It's hard to explain that to them that, 'Yeah, she's probably in heaven.'"
