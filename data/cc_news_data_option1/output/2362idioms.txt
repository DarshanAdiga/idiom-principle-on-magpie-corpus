Plus, the NBA has figured out how to put on a good entertainment product ‚Äî it's more than just the games, it's an experience in the arena. Even just watching a game on TNT, fans hang out after to see what Shaq and Charles will say. The NBA has figured out how to monetize all of that, and while the owners get rich, the players do well for themselves also. Starting a new league would be starting from the ground up to build what the NBA already has (and in many cases, has mastered).

Newly-single Kelly Clarkson has been on an "emotional roller coaster" over the past few months.
 The 38-year-old singer filed for divorce from husband Brandon Blackstock earlier this month - with the news coming as a shock to fans around the world. But in a new interview with Britain's Glamour magazine, which appears to have been conducted before the split news was made public, Kelly admitted her emotions have been all over the place during the coronavirus pandemic.
 "Honestly, I have been on an emotional rollercoaster," Kelly replied when asked how she was doing. "This has been really hard as a working parent, because I'm still doing all the same jobs. It's been exhausting honestly, cooking every meal and cleaning nonstop after toddlers and teenagers! Everybody's learning from home now and the teaching! So, everything has been crazy."
 Kelly has hit headlines in the past for her fluctuating weight, and has gone up and down with each of her pregnancies. But now she's feeling more happy with where she is in terms of her appearance, the former American Idol singer has a unique outlook on the pressures of staying slim in the music industry.
 Reflecting on Adele's recent reported seven stone weight loss, Kelly mused: "Even‚Ä¶ with Adele, I saw pictures of her too. I met Adele a long time ago and that girl is like a goddess. I don't care what kind of weight she's holding down; you walk in the room and she's like a force, just physically captivating. If someone wanted to do it for themselves and for their health but that doesn't change how many times I listened to her record."

Darrel Sykes told Yorkshire Live: "Our carpet and upholstery cleaning business dropped dead overnight once Boris said that we're locking down, so we knew we had to diversify in order to survive. People don't want you in their homes right now, after all.
 "We already had the equipment to sanitise flooded buildings, and we became key workers overnight as we helped to dry out and clean flooded properties in the region.
 "We have clients like the John Smith's Stadium, we've cleaned their carpets for years. Before the season was postponed, we went in and sanitised their changing rooms so it was all up to scratch, and then the FA cancelled the season. But from there, we started hearing from clients around Yorkshire who wanted a similar service.

I'm hearing a great deal of frustration from folks who are upset that today's story didn't name the five local restaurants experiencing outbreaks of COVID-19.
 Last week, it was churchgoers wondering if an outbreak at a place of worship was at their own. All along I've been hearing from families with loved ones in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and group homes calling for more specifics.
 Unless a business, church, restaurant, construction site, etc., tells people it is having an outbreak, there is no way to know and to verify.

When you are living a keto lifestyle, you know to steer clear of that slice of cake, the plate of pasta, and the bowl of sugary cereal. But it's important to remember that drinks can also contain lots of carbs! And it's not just in those milkshakes and coffee shop fraps--even drinks that are purportedly healthy, like green smoothies, are commonly loaded with added sugar. As a result, it's just as important to be mindful of your beverage choices as it is to be mindful of what you eat.

Democratic committee chairs don‚Äôt get beaten often, let alone by double- digits. Even though the old guard has frequently over the past decade been criticized as out of touch with the party base, that hasn‚Äôt often translated into open revolt, as name recognition and the right donors have been enough to hold would-be challengers at bay. If this poll is accurate, that time is rapidly ending. And the evolution of New York into a full-blown hotbed of progressive uprising could kick off a chain reaction in the party. If deeply entrenched incumbents like Engel can be knocked off, it‚Äôs possible that seats once perceived as fortresses for centrist incumbents might be vulnerable as well. One such office‚ÄîChuck Schumer‚Äôs senate seat‚Äîcomes up for re-election in 2022.

The wording used for this new feature seems to suggest that this is something that's coming to the Google Calendar app and not to Android Auto itself.

A random or accidental pattern that is misinterpreted as a meaningful pattern is known as a simulacrum. Seeing an image of the Virgin Mary in a scorched tortilla would be one example, or a demon's head in the hair of Queen Elizabeth II, as occurred on some 1954 Canadian notes.
 Seeing a letter or number where none exists is another form of a simulacrum.
 Being fooled by letter and number simulacra is an occupational hazard for die variety collectors. These dedicated coin-hunters doggedly look for the slightest die imperfection as thousands of coins pass beneath their loupes and microscopes. Much of their effort is directed at finding familiar types of die varieties such as repunched Mint marks, misplaced Mint marks, over Mint marks, dual Mint marks and repunched dates.
 False positives are inevitable since die imperfections often develop as the result of normal wear and tear. Once in a while, a spot of die damage -- a die dent, die gouge or impact scar -- will be mistaken for a letter or a number. Likewise, a patch of die erosion will produce a raised "bleb" on the surface of a coin that can look like a letter or numeral.

A small, shiny medallion riding inside the palm of one hand and seamlessly ending up in the other; similar to the practice of slipping the folded $20 dollar bill to the maitre d‚Äô on date night.‚Äù
