As of the end of October, 23 men and six women had been arrested under the national security law, according to the South China Morning Post. Violators face a maximum possible penalty of life in prison.
 Also this week, a Hong Kong broadcaster laid off 40 journalists, including an editor who accused managers of meddling in sensitive coverage, fueling fears about threats to press freedom.
 The broadcaster, i-Cable, announced it was cutting 100 positions from its workforce of 1,300. The company blamed the coronavirus pandemic, which has battered the Hong Kong economy.
 The layoffs included the station’s investigative reporting team. Other journalists and department heads resigned in protest.
 One of i-Cable’s senior editors, Wong Lai-ping, complained to public broadcaster RTHK that managers had tried to meddle in or discourage coverage of sensitive issues.
 Wong said that included reporting on 12 people who were arrested at sea by Chinese authorities while en route to Taiwan. Wong said managers wanted more coverage of a Chinese government news conference.
 “You can see the meddling,” Wong told RTHK.
 A survey by the Hong Kong Journalists Association found 87% of those who responded believed press freedom would be “severely affected” by the security law. More than half expressed concern for their personal safety.

The UK's quick approval of the Covid vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE means Britons will get first dibs on a shot developed in two other countries -- the US and Germany.
 Britain's drug regulator on Wednesday cleared the vaccine for emergency use, ahead of the US Food and Drug Administration and its European Union counterpart. The government cited a rule allowing the UK to authorize a shot independently ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period on Jan. 31. An accelerated review process in which regulators were able to monitor Pfizer's trial data in real time also helped.
 The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency "has done a great job of working with the company to look at that data as it's come through and do things in parallel, rather than one after the other as they normally would," Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in a radio appearance. He also credited Brexit, though the MHRA said the speedy authorization was conducted within EU guidelines.
 The move is particularly striking because BioNTech, which pioneered the messenger RNA technology behind the vaccine, is based in Germany and received 375 million euros ($450 million) in funding from its government. Pfizer, meanwhile, has a deal to supply the US with 100 million doses, though it didn't receive direct research support from the White House-led Operation Warp Speed Project.
   
   
 Vaccine Race
 Winning the race to vaccine approval has been important for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, with trust in his government in short supply after a series of missteps during the pandemic that left the UK with a death toll approaching 60,000 and its deepest recession for 300 years. Concerns have been raised over the time taken to develop the vaccine -- 10 months rather than the usual 10 years -- and why the MHRA was quicker to approve it than other regulators.
 Researchers and and health officials, concerned about vaccine hesitancy, have been sensitive to any appearance of political pressure to cut corners. After US President Donald Trump suggested the FDA would drag out its review of vaccine trials to hurt him politically, major drugmakers including Pfizer pledged publicly to uphold safety standards.
 The FDA also said it wanted to see two months of safety data before approving a vaccine -- a time frame that did not bind the UK.
 On Wednesday, British officials rushed to reassure people the newly licensed Pfizer vaccine is safe, ahead of its rollout across the country starting next week.
 Approval Process
 Everyone can be "absolutely confident that no corners whatsoever have been cut" in the approval process, said June Raine, chief executive of the UK regulator. Hancock even offered to receive the shot live on television.
 But after the accelerated decision, ministers have a challenge to convince the vast majority of the population to be vaccinated in order to ensure the program is effective.
 Drugmakers Pledge to Avoid Safety Shortcuts on Covid Vaccine
 In a televised briefing, Raine said the MHRA carried out an "extremely thorough and scientifically rigorous review" and the vaccine had only been approved "because those strict tests have been done and complied with."
 Pressed on why the UK had approved the vaccine before the US and EU, she said her colleagues had worked nights and weekends. "The public can be absolutely confident that the standards we have worked to are equivalent to those around the world," she said.
 Rolling Review
 The MHRA, like the European Medicines Agency, has been using a so-called rolling review process that lets officials monitor trial data as they arrive, rather than waiting for a full submission after a study is completed. BioNTech is awaiting a decision from the FDA in the middle of December, around the same time as it expects a ruling from the EU regulator, Chief Medical Officer Ozlem Tureci said in a press conference.
 Ahead of the FDA's scheduled Dec. 10 meeting to review the vaccine, agency staff members are going over the raw clinical trial data and checking Pfizer's calculations as well as reviewing information on the manufacturing process. The agency's regular approval process can take anywhere from six to 10 months for most drugs and vaccines.
 "The amount of data submitted to the FDA includes thousands of pages of technical information that must be divided up and reviewed by experts from different disciplines," an FDA spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

This is a column by Marianne Heimes, a Chatham County Board of Elections member and longtime contributor to the Savannah Morning News.
   
 In this season of thanksgiving, I would be remiss not to mention what I consider the heroes of the past election, audit/recount, now a recount, another election to come, and who knows what else. Elections could not be held without these awesome volunteers, nor could it be held without our also awesome staff. The past few weeks have been a marathon and somehow the finish line keeps slipping away.
   
 I'll start by thanking (Savannah Morning News editorial page editor) Adam Van Brimmer for his well-received complimentary column of Nov. 24. Thanks also go out to (Morning News staff writers) Will Peebles and Nick Robertson who took the time to research and write some great stories. More to come, guys!
   
 Our board chairman, Tom Mahoney, has gone above and beyond what he imagined his job to be. Thank you Tom, your time spent on board issues is much appreciated. Another big thanks to Russell Bridges who, in the midst of the recount, took a little time off for his daughter's wedding. A good thing he didn't have to plan the wedding, he has had to do enough planning at work to last a lifetime. He was fortunate to have the expert help of Caity Hamilton. Thanks also to fellow board members Antwan, Debbie, and Malinda for the time they invested.
   
 And there is more. Billy Wooten supervised the audit/recount with the help of Savannah, Gloria, and Vicky. Since there were at least 70 volunteers I can't name them all but trust me, I appreciate and thank you. I just saw 12 of them getting ready for the current recount.
   
 And lets not forget our technicians led by John Leffler. They have done a fantastic job. Our new machines are much different than the old ones, so first of all their job of finding space for them was difficult. They are on call during elections and ready to run to the aid of a poll manager experiencing a problem. They do much more than that, of course. Thanks to Lee Wright for getting the machines to the right place at the right time.
   
 And Lynn and Jeannie -- what a team. They arrange for our volunteer and poll workers and spent the entire time with the group doing the audit/recount. And Bob and Tiara, your ears must be sore from answering the phones. Thanks to Tyler, too.
   
 While I am in the grateful mood, I would also like to thank the Chatham County Commission and County Managers for procuring our "annex." Without it we might still be on the first recount.
   
 The June election was as disappointing to all of us as it was to all of you. We were faced with -- well, frankly we were faced with the unknown. I believe at that time we all took a deep breath and swore "that's not going to happen again."
   
 But there are more elections and roadblocks ahead so we will take another deep breath and do our jobs. If you happen to see someone who helped make the election process a success, please give them a thumbs up. They truly deserve it.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — An Ohio woman who fled the United States for Mexico ahead of her sentencing in one of the biggest corporate fraud cases in decades is asking for early release from prison, citing poor health and fear of contracting the coronavirus behind bars. Rebecca Parrett, now 72, was convicted in 2008 of securities fraud and other charges in a $1.9 billion scheme at health care financing company National Century Financial Enterprises. Parrett, who was free on bond, fled to Mexico after her conviction. Federal Judge Algenon Marbley sentenced her in absentia to 25 years in prison. Parrett was apprehended in 2010, sent to prison and is in a minimum-security federal prison in Dublin, California.

Traore has revealed how the Red and Blacks can get their campaign in the European competition back on track and explained his side are well encouraged to play against the Russian Premier League club.
 “We have a great team, which works well on a daily basis and which helps each other,” Traore told the club website.
 “We don't need to motivate ourselves for this kind of match, we all want to play, to take points and to be able to play the European Cup in February, that's our wish.
 “We have to play a big game. We have to turn the little details in our favour. You have to stay focussed, not get confused, have fun on the pitch and. With that, we can achieve a good result.
 “The club has the chance to play in the Champions League. It's an honour. We were keen to play big matches.
 “I don't think we disappointed our supporters against Krasnodar and against Chelsea. We can be proud of what we have achieved.
 “We did not have the results we hoped for, but these are matches that we must rely on. It's up to us to show that we want more. We want to get a result in Krasnodar.”
 Rennes are winless in their last five games across all competitions and the disappointing performances have seen them drop to the seventh spot on the Ligue 1 table.
 The Mali international is, however, still optimistic the Red and Blacks can put the run of poor results behind them soon.
 “A season is very long. Sometimes we go through difficult times. It's up to us to find the necessary resources to continue to work and keep the objectives in mind,” he continued.

Trunks that are gnarled and bumpy with limb scars are not attractive in my book. In addition, its leaves will collect beneath the tree, where few landscape plants will grow well as they compete with the roots for nutrients, which many people seem to find unattractive.

The UK's quick approval of the Covid vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE means Britons will get first dibs on a shot developed in two other countries -- the US and Germany.Britain's drug regulator on Wednesday cleared the vaccine for emergency use, ahead of the US Food and Drug Administration and its European Union counterpart. The government cited a rule allowing the UK to authorize a shot independently ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period on Jan. 31. An accelerated review process in which regulators were able to monitor Pfizer's trial data in real time also helped.The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency "has done a great job of working with the company to look at that data as it's come through and do things in parallel, rather than one after the other as they normally would," Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in a radio appearance. He also credited Brexit, though the MHRA said the speedy authorization was conducted within EU guidelines.The move is particularly striking because BioNTech, which pioneered the messenger RNA technology behind the vaccine, is based in Germany and received 375 million euros ($450 million) in funding from its government. Pfizer, meanwhile, has a deal to supply the US with 100 million doses, though it didn't receive direct research support from the White House-led Operation Warp Speed Project.Vaccine RaceWinning the race to vaccine approval has been important for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, with trust in his government in short supply after a series of missteps during the pandemic that left the UK with a death toll approaching 60,000 and its deepest recession for 300 years. Concerns have been raised over the time taken to develop the vaccine -- 10 months rather than the usual 10 years -- and why the MHRA was quicker to approve it than other regulators.Researchers and and health officials, concerned about vaccine hesitancy, have been sensitive to any appearance of political pressure to cut corners. After US President Donald Trump suggested the FDA would drag out its review of vaccine trials to hurt him politically, major drugmakers including Pfizer pledged publicly to uphold safety standards.The FDA also said it wanted to see two months of safety data before approving a vaccine -- a time frame that did not bind the UK.On Wednesday, British officials rushed to reassure people the newly licensed Pfizer vaccine is safe, ahead of its rollout across the country starting next week.Approval ProcessEveryone can be "absolutely confident that no corners whatsoever have been cut" in the approval process, said June Raine, chief executive of the UK regulator. Hancock even offered to receive the shot live on television.But after the accelerated decision, ministers have a challenge to convince the vast majority of the population to be vaccinated in order to ensure the program is effective.Drugmakers Pledge to Avoid Safety Shortcuts on Covid VaccineIn a televised briefing, Raine said the MHRA carried out an "extremely thorough and scientifically rigorous review" and the vaccine had only been approved "because those strict tests have been done and complied with."Pressed on why the UK had approved the vaccine before the US and EU, she said her colleagues had worked nights and weekends. "The public can be absolutely confident that the standards we have worked to are equivalent to those around the world," she said.Rolling ReviewThe MHRA, like the European Medicines Agency, has been using a so-called rolling review process that lets officials monitor trial data as they arrive, rather than waiting for a full submission after a study is completed. BioNTech is awaiting a decision from the FDA in the middle of December, around the same time as it expects a ruling from the EU regulator, Chief Medical Officer Ozlem Tureci said in a press conference.Ahead of the FDA's scheduled Dec. 10 meeting to review the vaccine, agency staff members are going over the raw clinical trial data and checking Pfizer's calculations as well as reviewing information on the manufacturing process. The agency's regular approval process can take anywhere from six to 10 months for most drugs and vaccines."The amount of data submitted to the FDA includes thousands of pages of technical information that must be divided up and reviewed by experts from different disciplines," an FDA spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

A spokesperson for Inhofe told Fox News on Tuesday that the senator is also frustrated by a lack of coronavirus relief and said he has supported passing an additional package.
 "May I suggest they try sharing their concerns with Speaker Pelosi or Sen. Schumer? They are the ones holding up relief - not Sen. Inhofe," the spokesperson told Fox News.
 Graham did not respond to Newsweek's request for comment about the body bags.
 The South Carolina lawmaker has previously suggested Congress should go "big and smart" on the next relief package, saying more money is needed than what other Republicans had supported but objecting to certain provisions proposed by House Democrats, The Hill reported.
 McConnell on Monday expressed support for passing another relief package.
 "The American people need more help now," he tweeted. "Congress should deliver more COVID relief this year."
 He also said there is "no reason" why lawmakers "should not deliver another major pandemic relief package to help the American people," according to Business Insider. Congress reconvened Monday, and McConnell told reporters Tuesday that if a deal is reached on a government funding bill, a COVID-19 relief package will likely be included.
 Meanwhile, a bipartisan congressional group that includes Collins, introduced their proposal for a $908 billion relief package on Tuesday, Politico reports.
 "This bipartisan, bicameral group worked night and day throughout the Thanksgiving recess because we recognize that families all across America are struggling, that businesses are closing, and that hospitals are overwhelmed," Collins said in a statement about the proposal.
 Lawmakers have been in a stalemate for months over another relief package -- unable to reach an agreement on the price tag and on certain key aspects to include.
 House Democrats in May passed the HEROES Act, a $3 trillion package that was never voted on in the Senate. Republicans in the Senate passed their own $1 trillion package, the HEALS Act in July.
 Negotiations have since been on again, off again. In November, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent McConnell a letter asking him to "join us at the negotiating table" after talks hit another dead end.

VIENNA (AP) — Austria will allow skiing to start on Dec. 24, but will limit the capacity of ski lifts and keep restaurants, bars and hotels largely closed until early January, officials said Wednesday. It also will require many people entering the country over the Christmas period to go into quarantine.
 Tough lockdown measures took effect Nov. 17 and are due to expire on Sunday. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said a limited curfew that has applied around the clock will be eased, and from Monday will apply only between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m.
 Schools will be reopened next week, except for older students, as will nonessential shops, museums, libraries and some other businesses. But restaurants will remain closed for all but takeout and deliveries, as will bars, and hotels will remain closed except to business travelers.
 Austria has been hard hit by the resurgence of coronavirus infections in Europe, though its infection rate has declined over recent weeks. It currently is recording 335 new infections per 100,000 residents over seven days, down from around 600 last month — but still more than twice as many as in neighboring Germany, which is in a milder partial shutdown.
 Kurz said that progress over recent weeks, and the expectation of more before Christmas, allows “cautious” reopening steps. But he said the tourism and catering sectors won’t start reopening until Jan. 7.
 That will effectively mean that, over the holiday season, skiing is possible in most cases only on day trips for those Austrian residents who live fairly close to the Alps. Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler said there will be mask- wearing and distancing requirements, and the capacity of cable cars will be limited.

LISBON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Pfizer's Portuguese unit said on Wednesday the pharmaceutical company would be able to distribute its COVID-19 vaccine in the Iberian country three days after the European Union's medicines agency (EMA) has given it the green light.
 "Once approved and once we know (...) where the vaccines should be delivered, we will get the vaccines to those places in a maximum of three days," Susana Marques, medical director at Pfizer Portugal, told RTP Television.
 The EMA said on Tuesday it could complete its reviews of candidate vaccines by Dec. 29 if drugmakers including Pfizer have provided it with sufficient data.
 Portugal's Health Minister Marta Temido said last month she hoped the country would be ready to start distributing shots as early as January.
 The government is set to announce its vaccination strategy on Thursday after a group of experts worked to decide which groups should get the vaccine first, as well as to look at distribution logistics from transport to storage.
 The health ministry has said the country of around 10 million people has contracts to buy 22 million doses of vaccines, without specifying from which, or how many, manufacturers.
 Britain approved Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, jumping ahead of the United States and Europe to become the West's first country to formally endorse the shot. (Reporting by Lisbon bureau, Writing by Catarina Demony, Editing by Mark Potter)

 # Da Vinci aids in MelroseWakefield's 1,000th robotic surgery
 Christina Rasmussen
 The MelroseWakefield Hospital surgery team recently performed their 1,000th robotic-assisted surgery.
 MelroseWakefield has offered numerous robotic-assisted procedures for abdominal, urological, and gynecological surgeries since the da Vinci Xi Surgical System joined the surgery team in 2018.
 As one of the most advanced pieces of medical equipment in the world, it deploys four arms that are capable of manipulating dozens of different instruments and has made a huge impact on both doctors and patients.
 “I am very proud of our team and the entire program,” said Dr. Adam Blau, MD, co-chair of the Robotic Surgery Program. “Two and a half years ago there were no robotic surgeries offered at our hospital, so we have certainly come a long way.”
 The team was able to train everyone in the operating room, assisting surgeons, sterile processing staff, and other healthcare workers on da Vinci when it was originally introduced in 2018. It has grown exponentially since then, with 10 different surgeons using the robot for a number of different procedures, including hernia repair, anti-reflux surgery, gallbladder surgery, weight-loss surgery, and kidney surgery.
 “To train everyone from scratch on robotic surgeries and accomplish 1,000 of them is awesome,” said Blau. “I’m super proud of the program and all who help to make it happen.”
 Da Vinci serves as an extension of the surgeons at MelroseWakefield, allowing complex procedures to be performed with greater precision and advanced instrumentation virtually extending the surgeon’s eyes and hands into the patient. The machine is not automated and is always under the control of a surgeon.
 “The robot is never doing stuff by itself,” said Dr. Matthew Brown, MD, co- chair of the program and chair of General Surgery at the hospital.“Some people have asked me, am I going to hit ‘play’ and go get a cup of coffee and then come back and it’s done? That is definitely not what robotic surgery is.”
 As an extremely advanced piece of equipment in surgical medicine, da Vinci also reduces patient pain and scarring, allows for faster recovery time, and a shorter hospital stay. With the minimally invasive approach and incisions being smaller, the patient has less postoperative pain, with a possibility of them not having to stay in the hospital overnight and opt for a day surgery.
 With a lot of the robotic surgeries, patients are taking Tylenol and ibuprofen after surgery, which has also become a tremendous advantage.
 “A patient can be discharged and sent home much sooner, and right back to their normal routine” said Blau. “This has become very beneficial, especially during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic."
 Some were skeptical about da Vinci and believed the team at MelroseWakefield would never use it, and that the machine would simply collect dust.
 “We were able to prove them completely wrong,” said Brown. “We do more robotic cases on our campus than downtown Tufts and Lowell General combined.”
 Some members of the community within the hospital were hesitant to work with the advanced equipment, but now nursing staff and other workers want to be using da Vinci and want to learn more about it. They went from operating with da Vinci a few times a week, to now five days a week, which is something the team is very proud of.
 “It has created such a positive atmosphere in the operating room and within the hospital,” said Brown. “People want to be in the robot room and we have a great time when we’re operating all day. It’s fun.”
 Robotic surgery programs like da Vinci at MelroseWakefield are equipping a new wave of doctors with abilities they’re increasingly expected to possess.
 “The surgery team is really proud of how far we’ve come since the equipment was brought to MelroseWakefield in 2018,” said Blau. “We’re eager to continue operating robotically and see what’s next.”

 And for his efforts, he’s been recognized by the New England Patriots.
 The Winchester resident was recently honored as a 2020 Patriots Difference Maker of the Week for his commitment to Voices of Hope, a registered non- profit that combines a passion for the performing arts with a desire to raise funds for cancer research. In honor of his volunteer efforts, the Kraft family and the New England Patriots Foundation are making a $5,000 donation in his honor.
 “For me, it justifies all the people who come through our doors and do the theater work behind the scenes for the shows,” he said. “It gives us some credence to stand up and say ‘This is what we do, this is what we’ve done, and we’re going to keep doing it.’ It puts a stamp on it saying that an organization such as the Kraft Foundation legitimizes the work that we’re doing.”
 Voices of Hope, an all-volunteer organization, was developed in honor of Chastain’s mother, Barbara Byrd, who died from pancreatic cancer in 2009.
 “She was an amazing woman,” Chastain said. “She was the one who started me on my musical journey when I was a kid – piano lessons, church choir, taking me to auditions.”
 During her final six months, Chastain said he would fly back and forth between Winchester and Indiana to help tend to his mother. He stayed there permanently during her last few weeks, getting to know the staff who cared for her.
 Because of his travels, Chastain was forced to drop out of a local production of "Aida." But the cast, who became some of his closest friends, stood by him in his time of need.
 The show opened the weekend his mother passed and lasted for three weeks. Upon his return, the cast told Chastain to take his part back and be a part of the show during its final night.
 “That’s kind of what my mother wanted,” he said. “The theater part has always been with me. So, having my friends who were with me during the end of her life and my theatrical family, I just wanted to give back to all the people who helped my mom. The one way I knew how was to put on a show.”
 Chastain would eventually put on a one-night show in Winchester with 20 theater friends to honor those who tried to save his mother. That one night raised $17,000, thus launching Voices of Hope.
 “It was really a mix of my mom passing at a time where I had to make that choice to go home and be with her, or to do a show which is what she always wanted me to do.,” he said. “It kind of mixed and crossed over so it gave me that idea to do the collaboration in her honor.”
 Chastain was inspired to leave his job in finance and dedicate his efforts full time to growing Voices of Hope. As president and founder, his efforts include securing sponsors, reviewing performance requests, evaluating potential performance venues, maintaining communication with the Voices of Hope members and more.
 The nonprofit hosts two major stage performances each year along with a performance at the Boston Hatch Shell, holiday performances and singing the National Anthem at sporting events.
 Since 2009, the Voices of Hope has donated more than $780,000 to cancer research, including the Termeer Center for Targeted Therapies at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. A pioneer in personalized cancer medicines, the Termeer Center offers a comprehensive translational research program to speed the discovery and delivery of new targeted therapies to patients with early and advanced-stage cancers.
 Patients in the Termeer Center are matched with a small clinical team whose expertise supports both advances in research and excellence in supportive patient care. With live performances halted due to COVID-19, Chastain rallied his members to record and submit video recordings of songs that were produced as a series of “virtual cabarets” and were privately shared with caregivers and patients receiving treatment at the Termeer Center.
 In the spring, Chastain secured a donation that allowed their rehearsal studio – the Nest – to be reconfigured with plexiglass enclosures to allow a small number of members to safely record to continue the mission of raising funds for cancer research.
 Chastain said the donation from the Krafts will go back into the organization.
 “It’s going to be able to create different styles of virtual entertainment so we can use those as fundraisers,” he said. “We’ll be able to take that money and turn it into fundraising efforts since we’re all having to adapt and learn how to do new things.”
 Chastain said the recognition would not have happened if not for a group effort.
 “The recognition may be in my name, but I really think it recognizes the whole organization,” he said. “It kind of solidifies and makes it known we are a legitimate (organization). An organization such as the Krafts knows how hard we’ve worked.”

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — An Ohio woman who fled the United States for Mexico ahead of her sentencing in one of the biggest corporate fraud cases in decades is asking for early release from prison, citing poor health and fear of contracting the coronavirus behind bars.
 Rebecca Parrett, now 72, was convicted in 2008 of securities fraud and other charges in a $1.9 billion scheme at health care financing company National Century Financial Enterprises.
 Parrett, who was free on bond, fled to Mexico after her conviction. Federal Judge Algenon Marbley sentenced her in absentia to 25 years in prison. Parrett was apprehended in 2010, sent to prison and is in a minimum-security federal prison in Dublin, California.
 She is asking for early release, saying she suffers from “a rare blood disease that has no cure,” and other ailments, including arthritis, high blood pressure, osteoporosis and cholesterol. She also fears contracting COVID-19 while in prison.
 In a six-page, single-spaced letter to Marbley filed in federal court last month, Parrett apologized to the judge for leaving the country, saying she was overwhelmed with depression and at “the lowest point of my life.”
 “I truly am sorry for the additional aggravation and work that I created for you and others,” Parrett wrote. “My state of mind was stuck on terminating my life and I never had any thought of other consequences at the time.”

As if allowing movie studios to shoot around the clock while shutting down small businesses might "invite a negative community response" or raise questions about the corrupt system.

On Dec. 7, 2017, Google's deep-learning chess program AlphaZero thrashed Stockfish-8. The chess engines played 100 games, with AlphaZero winning 28 and tying 72. It didn't lose a single game. AlphaZero did only 80,000 calculations per second, as opposed to Stockfish-8's 70 million calculations, and it took just four hours to learn chess from scratch by playing against itself a few million times and optimizing its neural networks as it learned from its experience.
