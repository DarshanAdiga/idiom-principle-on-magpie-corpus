This Blu-ray + DVD set has been years in the making, and it was worth the wait. The Puppetoon shorts are an absolute joy, and being able to see them looking so beautifully restored is a privilege. You really cannot fully judge these films by the screen captures shown in the review; the real magic is in the animation, and it is incredible. Arnie Leibovit has once again honored the memory of his friend and idol, George Pal. We look forward with great anticipation to a third volume!

The restorations overall are quite stunning. Some of the films do show their age, naturally, being over 70 years old; but everyone should be immensely satisfied, all things considered. The prize ASIFA-funded restorations look particularly sharp. The image, on all the Paramount shorts especially, is extremely clean, practically free from dirt or scratches, except in a rare instance or two. The Technicolor shorts naturally are also the most brilliant, and – by virtue of being primarily from original negatives – they look the sharpest as well. The age of the materials, and perhaps the filming techniques, means that some shots look a wee bit soft; and sometimes details get lost in the blacks, which is most true in _Wilbur_ , which was transferred from a nitrate print. The European shorts do look more worn, generally (and even _Ship Of The Ether_ is still quite soft, despite the new HD transfer), but their rarity makes one able to forgive that easily enough.

When Leibovit first announced the _Volume 2_ project a couple of years ago, I was personally extremely excited, and I began a correspondence with Arnie that led to me helping him in a small way behind the scenes on the release. Naturally, I am inclined to gush over the disc he has produced, but I am confident that the praise is all well-earned regardless. For some background on this release, and Arnie’s history with George Pal, I refer you to the interview we did in the summer of 2019.

Dan Jellyman, cabinet member for infrastructure, regeneration and heritage, believes the permit scheme will help ease the problems caused by roadworks in Stoke-on-Trent.
 He said: “Roadworks might be necessary, but as a motorist myself, I fully appreciate how frustrating it can be when you get stuck in a traffic jam.
 "I’ve seen comments recently from people questioning why there are so many roadworks taking place across the city at the same time, and the answer is that currently our options are very limited in preventing companies accessing and working on their assets which can be deeply frustrating.
