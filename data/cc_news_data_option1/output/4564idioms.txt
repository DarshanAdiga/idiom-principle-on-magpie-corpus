 Johnson said he had already passed that message on to his crestfallen players after the extraordinary 11-goal thriller at Plainmoor.
 League Two Crawley, who trailed 3-5 at one point in extra-time, led for the first and only time in the tie when Ashley Nadesan hit the winner in the 118th minute.
 Aaron Nemane, Ben Whitfield, Josh Umerah and Asa Hall with two penalties all scored for the Gulls, but a Tom Nichols hat-trick led Crawley’s fightback.
 “It was unbelievable,” said Johnson, who had watched his side go top of the National League with six wins in the first seven games of the season.
 “One minute you were up, the next you were down, then you were up again, and then you were down.
 “Credit to both teams to create a game like that. But if you are on the losing end, letting in six goals albeit in extra-time as well, then of course you are disappointed as the losing manager.
 “You’ve got to be careful, because at 2-0 up at half-time, it looked like the boys felt - I don’t think it was in their heads - but it looked like they thought they had won the game.
 “We are all upset not being in the FA Cup, but sometimes you have just got to give credit to the other side, and look at what went wrong for us.
 “I’ll have a good look at the video and see what we need to do.
 “I’ll only be watching the goals against, because I need to see why they kept getting through with only our goalie to beat.
 “You’ve got to be able to sustain that level of performance at the next level - on occasions we did, because at one point we were 5-3 up.
 “We’ve got to be stronger, and we weren’t.
 “But we’ve had a good start (to the season), and I said straight away to the lads - we mustn’t let it break our season up.”
 The Gulls’ next two league games are both at home, to Boreham Wood next Saturday (November 14) and Solihull Moors (November 17).

La Chiesa nissena ridefinisce le modalita della quotidianita pastorale nel nuovo diffondersi della pandemia, in relazione al DPCM del 6 novembre che ha diviso l'Italia in tre zone, indicando la Sicilia come zona arancione.Il Vescovo Mons. Mario Russotto, dopo una riflessione condivisa con i Vescovi di Sicilia e dopo un confronto con il Collegio dei Consultori della Diocesi, ha inviato a tutti i sacerdoti una lettera con le nuove disposizioni, nel «surreale e drammatico clima che stiamo vivendo» in cui «siamo chiamati a ritrovare ancor piu il senso della nostra vocazione e il coraggio della nostra missione, coniugando la cura di noi stessi con una piu alta e responsabile vigilanza verso tutti coloro che sono affidati al nostro ministero pastorale».   A partire da questo il Vescovo ha disposto che:   -       Le celebrazioni liturgiche con la partecipazione del popolo continueranno a svolgersi «nel rispetto del protocollo sottoscritto dal Governo e dalla Conferenza Episcopale Italiana», con tutte le misure organizzative di garanzia di sicurezza.   -       Il catechismo per i ragazzi, i percorsi di formazione al matrimonio cristiano e gli incontri di catechesi continueranno in condizioni di ancora maggiore prudenza, «in piccoli gruppi, in proporzione allo spazio dell'aula liturgica, e rispettando rigorosamente tutte le norme igienico-sanitarie».   -       Le Lectio di Avvento per i giovani e per gli sposi e fidanzati, per evitare gli spostamenti dai Comuni, si svolgeranno a cura delle _equipes_ di pastorale giovanile e familiare nelle rispettive parrocchie, dove, dopo un momento di preghiera, si seguira la meditazione del Vescovo in video-conferenza «sapendo che, nello stesso momento, si e in comunione con il Vescovo e con tutte le comunita parrocchiali della Diocesi».   -       Sabato 21 novembre, alle ore 19, in tutte le chiese e le comunita religiose della Diocesi sara celebrata una Veglia di Preghiera «invocando il Signore, per intercessione di Maria Santissima, di aiutarci con la sua potente mano a fermare questa rapida diffusione della pandemia».   Continuera incessante l'attivita di solidarieta che, attraverso la Caritas e le parrocchie, la Chiesa nissena ha messo in campo fin dalla scorsa primavera per sostenere con tutte le forme di aiuto le persone e le famiglie in difficolta, attivita che hanno consentito nei mesi scorsi di alleviare i disagi di tanti che nel nostro territorio gia soffrivano per la mancanza di lavoro in un contesto gia economicamente fragile e deprivato.

Major challenges that companies face while executing digital transformation include the lack of budget allocation and planning. To undertake a digital transformation, a company needs to make a huge investment in acquiring state- of-the-art technology and the appropriate team to execute the same. Thus, the entire process requires a huge capital, which may lead to lower profits initially, however in the long run, the huge investment could become one of the main reasons for business success. Lack of budget allocation affects organizational decision making and pursuing transformation initiatives. To overcome this, the companies need to have a strategy in place for the long- term and have a sound capital plan.

 What we are watching in Canada ...
 OTTAWA - As Canadians prepare to mark Remembrance Day this week, concerns are growing about military veterans struggling with the effects of COVID-19.
 Oliver Thorne, executive director of the Vancouver-based Veterans Transition Network, says the pandemic is taking a financial, emotional and physical toll on those suffering from service-related injuries.
 Worries about disabled Canadian veterans first emerged in the spring as the country went into lockdown due to the pandemic.
 Some of that eased as summer saw many of those restrictions lifted, but the second wave and looming winter have resurrected those fears.
 The concerns run the gamut from injured veterans not being able to get the physiotherapy or rehabilitation they need, to those with post-traumatic stress disorder missing out on in-person therapy and support.
 For years, veterans suffering from P-T-S-D have been told not to isolate themselves, but instead get out of their homes and connect with support programs.
 Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole -- a veteran himself -- is urging anyone struggling because of the pandemic to reach out to family, friends or support networks.

 As tributes poured in for the Canadian-born "Jeopardy!" host, who died Sunday after a battle with pancreatic cancer, many remembered his unflappable demeanour, sharp wit and prolific broadcasting skills that made him a suppertime staple in living rooms.
 "As the host of 'Jeopardy!' for almost four decades, he hosted more episodes of a single television game show than anyone else in history," said a statement from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who also called Trebek an "icon" on Twitter.
 The official "Jeopardy!" Twitter account said Trebek died early Sunday morning surrounded by family and friends. He was 80.
 Trebek revealed in March 2019 that he'd been diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The survival rate was low, he said in a video, but he vowed to "fight" and "keep working."
 The Sudbury, Ont.-born personality did indeed continue to work, maintaining a rigorous shooting schedule. He kept fans informed of his health status in YouTube videos, with his signature suit and measured delivery, on the "Jeopardy!" set.

McCarrick, 90, was defrocked last year after the Vatican determined he sexually abused adults and children, including during confession.
 ___
 MCCARRICK'S RESPONSE
 McCarrick has said he was innocent of the fondling accusation but accepted the pope's sanctions.
 "While I have absolutely no recollection of this reported abuse, and believe in my innocence, I am sorry for the pain the person who brought the charges has gone through, as well as for the scandal such charges cause our people," he said in a statement June 20, 2018 after the initial fondling allegations were substantiated.
 In a 2008 email McCarrick sent to the Vatican, he denied ever having sexual relations with anyone but said he had shown an "unfortunate lack of judgment" for having shared his bed with seminarians.
 ___
 VIGANO'S BOMBSHELL:
 The McCarrick scandal took on greater dimensions on Aug. 26, 2018 when the former Vatican ambassador to the U.S., Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, published an 11-page expose accusing two dozen U.S. and Vatican churchmen by name of knowing about McCarrick's misconduct since at least 2000 and hiding it. Vigano cited the case of one former seminarian who in 1994 wrote a lengthy letter to his bishop detailing McCarrick's sexual abuse of him and others -- a document that would have been turned over to the Vatican at the very least in 2004 when the man was defrocked.
 Vigano demanded Francis resign, saying he had told the pope in 2013 during one of their first meetings that McCarrick has "corrupted generations of seminarians and priests, and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance." Vigano claimed that Francis rehabilitated McCarrick from Benedict's sanctions and turned him into a trusted adviser.
 ___
 VATICAN'S RESPONSE
 Francis initially refused to comment, but later authorized a Vatican investigation into its archives to determine who knew what and when about McCarrick, the result of which is being released Tuesday.
 In 2019, Francis told Mexican broadcaster Televisa that he didn't know anything about McCarrick's past and didn't remember if Vigano had raised the issue with him when they met in 2013.
 In addition, Cardinal Marc Ouellet, head of the Congregation for Bishops, confirmed McCarrick had been subject to disciplinary measures for uncorroborated "rumors" of misconduct but said the Vatican's decision for him to live a discreet life of prayer stopped short of binding canonical sanctions because the rumors lacked proof. Ouellet accused Vigano of mounting a "blasphemous" political hit job against Francis.
 ___
 FURTHER REVELATIONS
 A former McCarrick aide, Monsignor Anthony Figueriredo, in May 2019 released excerpts of correspondence that show McCarrick was placed under written Vatican restrictions in 2008 for sleeping with seminarians, but regularly flouted them with the apparent knowledge of Vatican officials under Benedict and Francis.
 In December 2019, the Washington Post reported that McCarrick gave more than $600,000 in donations from a personal fund he controlled to powerful clerics in the U.S. and Vatican, including those who had a say in whether to investigate him. The payments underscored the common tradition among well- funded bishops and religious superiors to curry favor in the Vatican with checks.
 McCarrick also helped funnel millions of dollars to three popes via the U.S. Papal Foundation, which he helped co-found to raise money from wealthy American Catholics for specific works of papal charity.

 LONDON, Nov 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Earlier in 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic forced a year's delay to planned U.N. climate talks in Glasgow - originally set to start on Monday - young climate activists chafed that no innovative way could be found to hold the COP26 summit online.
 "Then somebody said, out of the blue, 'Why don't we do our own?'" remembered Josh Tregale, 18, a British student whose final-year school exams were cancelled as a result of the virus.
 On Nov. 19, after months of organising, Tregale and others will launch the two-week "Mock COP", designed to mirror the format of the delayed U.N. talks, but with youth from more than 140 nations as the negotiators.
 The online event will focus on themes including climate education, carbon targets, climate justice, health and green jobs, and aims to produce a negotiated outcome statement in the same legal format as the official talks.
 "It's about us saying, 'We'd like you to listen. We can be more than token young people. We have learned enough about climate change that we could put things in place ourselves'," said Tregale, who postponed starting an engineering degree at Imperial College London for a year to help organise the summit.
 The negotiations will "illustrate what we would do ourselves if we had a seat at the table", he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview.
 The event comes as young climate activists have struggled to maintain momentum under COVID-19 restrictions that have made 2019's high-profile, millions- strong street marches impossible.
 While youth activists have pushed ahead with online campaigning, they have had limited influence on key issues such as how virus-hit nations spend trillions of dollars in pandemic stimulus spending, much of which has not supported green aims.
 A surge in disasters fuelled by climate change - from wildfires to floods and hurricanes - meanwhile, is driving a growing sense of urgency and frustration.
 'WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMANS'
 Sofia Hernández Salazar, 22, one of the Mock COP organisers from Costa Rica, said powerful Hurricane Eta destroyed so many roads there this month that she could not travel from the rural area where she has been staying to the capital.
 "When we talk about the climate crisis, we are talking about humans," she said.
 A political science student with a focus on human rights, she first became aware of climate risks while volunteering with a non-governmental organisation assisting refugees and migrants.
 "I was reading about how climate change was going to impact migration," she recalled - something that led her to join the Fridays for Future school strike movement launched by Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg.
 Hernández now aims to become a climate diplomat - with Costa Rican former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres as her role model - and push action on what she sees as key issues, such as rising uncompensated "loss and damage" from climate disasters.
 "We are not afraid," she said of youth activists. "Sometimes the issue with our voices is we are being heard, but not taken into account," she added.
 Dom Jaramillo, 21, an Ecuadorian delegate to the Mock COP, said the event - unlike the usual U.N. climate talks - plans to give a particularly strong say to developing-world delegates and those most affected by climate impacts.
 Britain's Tregale said richer countries were allowed up to three delegates for the event, while developing countries were allocated up to five places.
 Jaramillo, the daughter of banana farmers and one of the summit organisers, called it "a great opportunity to hear the voiceless, those most affected by the climate crisis".
 She laughed at the idea that "everyone says we're the leaders of the future".
 "I find myself leading things in the present," she noted, as the urgency for climate action grows.
 SPENDING 'OUR MONEY'
 Tregale said the first week of the youth-led talks would focus on panel discussions and speeches to help participants and listeners - the event is open to the public - learn more about climate issues and solutions.
 The delegates, most in their teens or 20s and many still in school, will then begin negotiating an outcome, which they hope could feed into broader climate policy or be used to lobby their own governments for greater ambition.
 The event also aims to be a model of what is possible with low-carbon online negotiations. Regular COP meetings, with delegates flying in from around the world, can produce 50,000 or more tonnes of climate-changing emissions, Tregale said.
 The Mock COP, by contrast, will produce emissions "in the tens" of tonnes, he said.
 Most delegates see the push for climate action - and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic - as an intensely personal struggle, said Tregale.
 He stepped up his involvement after a failed effort to hold his local authorities to account for investments in fossil fuels.
 "It's young people who will graduate into an economy that's really struggling" because of the pandemic, he said.
 "Young people will pay the tax to pay off the (economic stimulus and climate) decisions we make now. It´s effectively our money they´re spending at the moment... (and) young people should have a voice, especially at this time," he added.
 For him, the Mock COP should at least change views of what young activists are capable of doing rather than being perceived as little more than an inspiration for older officials.
 "People will have seen that (we) care, and that we can do more than just strike and protest," he said. (Reporting by Laurie Goering @lauriegoering; editing by Megan Rowling. Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters. Visit http://news.trust.org/climate)

SAN MARCOS, Texas — A day of eye-catching firsts contributed to App State moving forward with no Sun Belt Conference losses on its record.
 App State built a lead with first-time touchdowns from a trio of Mountaineers, who remained unbeaten in league play with a 38-17 victory at Texas State.
 App State (5-1, 3-0) led 24-10 at the break thanks to first-half scores on a 32-yard catch from tight end Miller Gibbs, a 49-yard interception return from linebacker Brendan Harrington and a 1-yard reception from part-time fullback Caleb Spurlin, a starting defensive end.
 Shemar Jean-Charles' third-quarter interception at the App State 9-yard line preceded a 91-yard touchdown march from the Mountaineers, capped by Zac Thomas' third touchdown pass of the day, a 9-yard connection with Jalen Virgil. Camerun Peoples closed the scoring on his 32-yard touchdown run with 5:59 left in the game against the Bobcats (1-8, 1-4).
 "Any time you win in college football you take it, I don't care if it's 2-0 or 100-99," App State head coach Shawn Clark said. "We were down here a few years ago and won on a last-second play and celebrated like crazy. We're going to celebrate tonight and, road warriors, it's off for a week and we're back home at The Rock."
 App State traveled to the Central time zone for the second straight week and followed up a 31-13 win at ULM with another one-sided victory. The Mountaineers used a balanced effort to maintain their unblemished Sun Belt record going into next weekend's home game against Georgia State (3-3, 2-3).
 Daetrich Harrington accounted for 113 of App State's 258 rushing yards, and Thomas completed 18 of his 27 passes for 168 yards with no interceptions. He hooked up with 10 different receivers while moving into third place on App State’s list for career touchdown passes (increasing his total to 60) and fourth place for career total offense (7,157 yards). On special teams, Chandler Staton made his only field goal try, a 33-yard attempt with 15 seconds left in the first half.
 Demetrius Taylor and Jalen McLeod contributed sacks Saturday to help lead a defense that benefited from a career-high 10 tackles by D'Marco Jackson, who added 1.5 tackles for loss and two pass breakups. The Mountaineers forced two turnovers, limited Texas State to four conversions on 12 third-down tries and no conversions on three fourth-down attempts — all in the second half. Those stops were made on snaps from the App State 28 (ending with Jean-Charles' interception), the Texas State 47 and the App State 19.
 "We gave up a couple opportunities, but all the mistakes, they're on us and they're things we can fix," Brendan Harrington said. "I think we played well as a defense. We got to the quarterback and pressured him a lot and closed a lot of gaps."
 A collision between two defenders on a deep throw helped Texas State connect for a 75-yard touchdown pass on the third play from scrimmage, but App State responded with a touchdown drive that included a 14-yard catch by Gibbs on a third-and-3 pass to avoid a quick punt.
 Four plays later, after tight end Henry Pearson had fallen on a teammate's fumble, Gibbs scored his first career touchdown.
 "Miller Gibbs came in and gave us a shot in the arm," Clark said. "I thought our tight ends played excellent today, and Miller Gibbs was a big part of that. We're going to need more people, because as we get into this stretch, people are going to get banged up, but it's a next-man-up mentality."
 App State took the lead for good late in the first quarter, when Harrington came up with his third interception of the season on a throw toward midfield. He found an opening along the Mountaineers' sideline and received help from Jackson's blocking to reach the end zone.
 Jackson's defensive work turned a first down from the App State 21 into a short field goal for Texas State on its next possession, and the Mountaineers increased their advantage with an 11-play, 75-yard drive.
 Christian Wells' 15-yard reception on a third-and-9 play extended the drive, and Spurlin entered the game as a fullback for a first-and-goal snap. Having blocked on short touchdown runs against Campbell and ULM, Spurlin leaked out to the right and was unguarded as he hauled in a short pass from Thomas.
 "In high school, all four years, I played both sides of the ball, so I had played some fullback," Spurlin said. "It's pretty second nature to me at this point, so it wasn't anything really new or tricky for me."

Rabinovitch says she hopes to congratulate the winner in-person (and from a distance), but depending on where the writer lives, organizers may have to get "creative."
 "We have some alternate endings," she said with a laugh. "You'll have to watch on Monday to find out."
 Despite the logistical challenges, Rabinovitch says shifting the proceedings online has lowered the costs of the ceremony. In light of those savings, prize organizers are donating $25,000 each to the Indigenous Voices Awards and Diaspora Dialogues, an initiative to support diverse writers.
 The event will air on CBC and its Gem streaming service at 9 p.m. tonight.
 The finalists were chosen by jury members Mark Sakamoto, Eden Robinson, David Chariandy, Tom Rachman, and Claire Armitstead.
 The long list of 14 titles announced in September had some big names who didn't make the cut, including Thomas King, Emma Donoghue, and Lynn Coady.
 A total of 118 works were submitted for this year's prize, according to organizers.
 Founded in 1994, the Giller awards $100,000 annually to the author of the best Canadian novel, graphic novel or short story collection published in English, and $10,000 to each of the finalists.

The dollar traded mostly at ¥103.20 in the morning, sandwiched between selling amid growing risk-on sentiment after Democratic candidate Joe Biden's victory declaration in the U.S. presidential race and buying by Japanese importers for settlement purposes as well as buybacks.
 In the afternoon, the greenback bounced back to levels above ¥103.50 on renewed safe-haven buying stemming from rekindled concerns that "incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump's continued rejection to accept the election result would prevent the United States from implementing economic measures," an official at a Japanese securities firm said.
 The euro's appreciation on the back of strong German economic data also provided support to the dollar vis-a-vis the yen in late trading, traders added.

The disputed land mostly falls in western Tigray, where much of the past week's fighting has unfolded.
 In Amhara, lingering grievances over this perceived injustice helped fuel anti-government protests that swept Abiy to the premiership in 2018.
 Even with the TPLF now sidelined from power under Abiy, tensions over the land remain unresolved.
 Over the past week in Gondar, the largest city in northern Amhara, residents have found a variety of ways to support forces taking the fight to the TPLF.
 Anmut Mulat, head of one of the city's sub-districts, immediately started collecting money and Ethiopian staples -- injera flatbread and powder to make shiro stew -- from his constituents, most of whom contributed without being asked.
 Standing beside a table where donated injera was drying out in the sun, he told AFP he fully supported the government's stated goal of "liberating" Tigray from its ruling party.
 "Our goal is to bring to justice the criminal cliques, the people who we call criminals who are currently leading in Tigray," Anmut said.
 -'Our brothers and sisters'-
 Anmut stressed, though, that his animosity did not extend to the Tigrayan population as a whole.
 "Our societies are integrated. We've been living together for a very long time. You can't separate us," he said.
 Abiy has taken a similar line, railing against the TPLF while insisting in a Twitter post Sunday that Tigrayans writ large should not be discriminated against.
 Such sentiments have also been on display at blood-donation tents that have popped up in Gondar.
 However some residents made clear they saw their donations as a contribution to just one side of the war effort.
 "This regional government victimised so many Ethiopians for the last 27 years," said Asebe Assefa, a 29-year-old banker, referring to the TPLF.
 "The people want revenge," he added.

 Nov 9 (Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 jumped on Monday as investors cheered Joe Biden's U.S. election victory on hopes of more monetary stimulus and calmer global trade, while also awaiting progress on a Brexit deal with the European Union.
 The blue-chip FTSE 100 index gained 1.5% to touch its highest since Oct. 14, with Taylor Wimpey Plc surging 11.5% after the homebuilder said it was on track to deliver annual results above market expectations.
 The wider homebuilders' sub-index rose 2.3%, while mining stocks advanced 2.6% on stronger metal prices.
 Ninety nine of all FTSE 100 stocks were trading in blue, with only online car marketplace Auto Trader in the red.
 The domestically focussed mid-cap FTSE 250 gained 1.5%, boosted by a 2.6% jump in travel and leisure stocks.
 "At the moment, it's just more relief over election result than anything else," said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com.
 "Brexit is potentially a big risk right now as we approach this end game and we're just sort of clutching at straws with guessing what the most likely outcome is."
 Britain said on Monday it was open to a "sensible" compromise on fishing and that there was goodwill on both sides to progress towards a Brexit trade deal as a new round of talks began in London.
 UK markets started November on a stronger footing as the British government and the Bank of England ramped up stimulus measures to support an economy facing a second nationwide coronavirus-induced lockdown.

He promised you a speedy return to normal. But the pandemic has created a new normal in America, and it is nothing like the past.

 Still, he thought he had you beaten. He thought he had drained every bit of reliance from your veins. He thought you had given up. He was sure he had won.

Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute, said SoftBank had displayed "a steady performance" in line with robust gains in the global equity market.
 SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has transformed a telecoms company into an investment and tech behemoth with stakes in some of Silicon Valley's hottest startups through its $100 billion Vision Fund.
 He has battled opposition to his strategy of pouring money into startups — including troubled office-sharing firm WeWork — which some analysts say are overvalued and lack clear profit models.
 Son has insisted that his strategy is sound, and that SoftBank's portfolio is broad enough to weather the storm.
 The firm said its SoftBank Vision Fund saw strong results thanks to recovering stock markets and increases in portfolio firms where "exits have been decided or have new funding rounds, or (which) are benefiting from the accelerated adoption of digital services during the COVID-19 crisis."
 The results come after SoftBank launched an aggressive plan to sell up to $41 billion in assets to finance a stock buy-back and reduce its debt.
 It has ended up far surpassing that goal, raising $56 billion, and said plans for the additional money made have "yet to be determined".
 "Given the current concern for future waves of Covid-19, SoftBank Group believes it needs to further enhance cash reserves," the firm said in a statement.
 In September, it announced an agreement to sell British chip designer Arm to U.S. firm Nvidia for up to $40 billion, potentially creating a new giant in the industry.
 If approved, the deal will be one of the largest acquisitions in the world this year and propel Nvidia to the forefront of the semiconductor sector.
 But the sale faces challenges, including securing approval from regulators in the U.K., Europe, the United States and China.
 Still, SoftBank "has a great track-record of somehow taking its sale of assets to the finish line against all odds," said Amir Anzarvadeh, strategist at Asymmetric Advisors, in a note.
 Paired with the recent recovery in tech stocks, SoftBank's asset sale strategy appears to be paying off, analysts said.
 "Son has walked the talk" by meeting and then exceeding the asset-selling target, Ishino said.
 "We are now paying attention to what action he is going to take next, at a time when SoftBank Group is turning into an investment firm," Ishino added.
 Son has struggled to interest investors in a second round of the Vision Fund as he deals with the woes of some of his most high-profile investments, notably WeWork.
 Once hailed as a dazzling unicorn valued at $47 billion, the office-sharing start-up has suffered a stunning fall from grace.

The reading of about 450 names of veterans from Monroe County who died in America's wars will highlight a special Veterans Day ceremony Wednesday at the River Raisin National Battlefield education center and battlefield site that is decorated with more than 500 American flags until Nov. 15.
   
 The Monroe Exchange Club in partnership with the battlefield is holding a "Field of Honor" commemoration that will begin at 11 a.m. at the site located next to the education center at 333 N. Dixie Hwy. and E. Elm Ave. During the program, a "recognition of the fallen" will be held and include reading the names of all county veterans who died from the War of 1812 up to today.
   
 Representatives from the display's two major sponsors - Physicians of ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital and Garry and Barb Markle - will read the names along with members of the Exchange Club. Deacon Michael Stewart will give the invocation.
   
 The Monroe County Historical Museum compiled the list of the fallen, said Doug Chaffin, president of First Merchants Bank and co-chairman of the display along with Barry Buschmann, senior vice president of Mannik & Smith. The list contains names of military service men and women.
   
 The list of about 450 men and women in the military who perished during the Civil War will be read aloud at a closing ceremony set for 2 p.m. Nov. 15 at the site.
   
 "One interesting side note is that Monroe County is noted for one of the highest, if not the highest per capita residents who served in the Civil War," Chaffin said. "Thus the significant number of the fallen during that time."
   
 The public is invited to attend the ceremony and help celebrate Veterans Day, a national holiday dedicated to American veterans of all wars. The battlefield park preserves and commemorates the January, 1813, battles with the British and Native Americans. The battles and the battle cry, "Remember the Raisin!", were a turning point in the War of 1812 and helped inspire a massive U.S. victory at the Battle of the Thames.
   
 Wednesday's event follows a formal dedication and opening ceremony held Saturday morning at the site that featured remarks by local, state and federal officials and dignitaries. Miss Monroe County Madalyn Poupard sang the national anthem and Larry Smith, president of Exchange, gave closing comments. Deacon Stewart also gave the invocation.
   
 The 40-member club is hosting the "Flags of Honor" display in celebration of its 100th anniversary of service in Monroe County. The exhibit is lighted so viewers can see the display 24/7 and at night with floodlights, Chaffin said.
   
 "It's quite impressive under the lights," Chaffin said. "They have really powerful floodlights that were donated by Baker's Ace Hardware store. It's proper to have them lighted from dawn to dusk."
   
 The 3-by5-foot flags fly from 10-foot-tall poles that were installed Wednesday at the site. The flags are placed 10 feet apart so visitors can easily walk through the exhibit, Chaffin said.
   
 "Some of our members will be there to answer questions about the display," he said.
   
 With the public's help, the display can be expanded as the club is offering various levels of sponsorships from individuals, businesses and organizations wanting to post one or more flags at the site. So far, more than 100 additional flags have been added thanks to sponsors, Chaffin said.
   
 Businesses and individuals are encouraged to honor family, friends and loved ones who serve or have served in the military, he said.
   
 "For as little as $35, people can honor someone by sponsoring a U.S. flag" to be included in the display, he said. "We're getting a lot of sponsorship inquiries now that the flags are up."
   
 Any flag purchased may be personalized with a photo or any other type of memorial that will be placed on or near the flag. Purchased flags may be picked up after the closing ceremony Nov. 15.
   
 Higher flag sponsorship opportunities range from $250 to $5,000. Anyone interested can sponsor a flag by visiting the Exchange Club of Monroe's Facebook page or the club's Flags of Honor Web site: www.healingfield.org/event/monroemi20.
   
 Other members of the club serving on the display steering committee include Julie Harman, Jennifer Swope, Ashley O'Dwyer, Renee Warnimont and Conly Crossley. Scott Bennett, superintendent of the park, also serves on the panel.
   
 The exhibit and ceremonies fall in line with the Exchange Club's mission of service and unity during the past century, Chaffin said. It also is in recognition and collective respect for those who serve, or have served, in the nation's military.
   
 "The timing of this exhibit turned out very well" with the holiday, he said. "The inspiration for this started with recognizing the values of our first responders and military personnel… this is right down our alley for our club."

CAPE TOWN, South Africa
 Billionaire South African businessman Patrice Motsepe entered the race to be president of the African soccer confederation on Monday.
 Motsepe, who owns South African club Mamelodi Sundowns, announced he was standing and was backed by South African soccer association president Danny Jordaan, who is a vice president of the Confederation of African Football and an executive committee member.
 Nigerian federation president Amaju Pinnick, who initially considered standing himself, also supported Motsepe's bid, as did Sierra Leone federation president Isha Johansen. Pinnick and Johansen are also on CAF's executive committee.
 "It's not just endorsing him," Pinnick said. "We will work night and day in ensuring he gets elected. And I can assure you 100% that Patrice Motsepe will be the next president of CAF."
 Motsepe did not attend the announcement at the South African soccer association headquarters in Johannesburg because he was in self-isolation and may have contracted COVID-19, organizers said. Current African soccer president Ahmad Ahmad is also in self-isolation in a hotel in Cairo after testing positive for the coronavirus.

In a 2008 email McCarrick sent to the Vatican, he denied ever having sexual relations with anyone but said he had shown an “unfortunate lack of judgment” for having shared his bed with seminarians.
 ___
 VIGANO’S BOMBSHELL:
 The McCarrick scandal took on greater dimensions on Aug. 26, 2018 when the former Vatican ambassador to the U.S., Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, published an 11-page expose accusing two dozen U.S. and Vatican churchmen by name of knowing about McCarrick’s misconduct since at least 2000 and hiding it. Vigano cited the case of one former seminarian who in 1994 wrote a lengthy letter to his bishop detailing McCarrick's sexual abuse of him and others — a document that would have been turned over to the Vatican at the very least in 2004 when the man was defrocked.
 Vigano demanded Francis resign, saying he had told the pope in 2013 during one of their first meetings that McCarrick has "corrupted generations of seminarians and priests, and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.” Vigano claimed that Francis rehabilitated McCarrick from Benedict’s sanctions and turned him into a trusted adviser.
 ___
 VATICAN’S RESPONSE
 Francis initially refused to comment, but later authorized a Vatican investigation into its archives to determine who knew what and when about McCarrick, the result of which is being released Tuesday.
 In 2019, Francis told Mexican broadcaster Televisa that he didn’t know anything about McCarrick’s past and didn’t remember if Vigano had raised the issue with him when they met in 2013.
 In addition, Cardinal Marc Ouellet, head of the Congregation for Bishops, confirmed McCarrick had been subject to disciplinary measures for uncorroborated “rumours” of misconduct but said the Vatican’s decision for him to live a discreet life of prayer stopped short of binding canonical sanctions because the rumours lacked proof. Ouellet accused Vigano of mounting a “blasphemous” political hit job against Francis.
 ___
 FURTHER REVELATIONS
 A former McCarrick aide, Monsignor Anthony Figueriredo, in May 2019 released excerpts of correspondence that show McCarrick was placed under written Vatican restrictions in 2008 for sleeping with seminarians, but regularly flouted them with the apparent knowledge of Vatican officials under Benedict and Francis.
 In December 2019, the Washington Post reported that McCarrick gave more than $600,000 in donations from a personal fund he controlled to powerful clerics in the U.S. and Vatican, including those who had a say in whether to investigate him. The payments underscored the common tradition among well- funded bishops and religious superiors to curry favour in the Vatican with checks.
 McCarrick also helped funnel millions of dollars to three popes via the U.S. Papal Foundation, which he helped co-found to raise money from wealthy American Catholics for specific works of papal charity.
