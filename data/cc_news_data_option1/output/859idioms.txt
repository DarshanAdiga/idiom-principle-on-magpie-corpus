Technical chart claims that Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (KALA) would settle between $5.83/share to $6.3/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $5.03 mark, then the market for Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $4.7 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.51. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

To ensure connectivity between these two mountain ranges, so that the animals that live in them don't become genetically isolated, TNC and other groups have bought land or land easements from willing sellers in the Tehachapi and Temblor Mountains. These two smaller mountain ranges trend east/west and serve to connect the Sierra Nevada and Coast Range, which trend north/south.


  "TNC and Kern CNPS are working to restore a floodplain at the Tollhouse Ranch to support a diverse array of native plants, including the endangered Bakersfield Cactus and the iconic Valley Oak," explained The Nature Conservancy's Zach Principe, who oversaw the recent planting of seedlings. "This project would not be possible without the dedication of Kern CNPS volunteers since 2017."


  The oak seedlings were grown by CNPS member Bill Nelson from acorns he collected from a large Valley Oak growing near the planting site. They were grown in tall 14-inch tree pots which are ideally suited for oaks, since they have a long taproot that starts descending even before the first upright shoot appears.


  The seedlings were given some protection from gophers by the use of wire mesh sleeves, made from 24-inch tall hardware cloth. There were no wire bottoms on these cages, since the oak roots need the ability to sink deep into the soil, and most gopher attacks come from them tunneling in from the sides.


  To protect against being nibbled off at the surface by herbivores, each seedling also received a small above-ground plastic tree tube and a stake to hold it in place. A drip irrigation system was installed, which will help the trees get established for the first year or two.


  Among those who participated in the hole digging, irrigation system establishment and tree planting were Zach Principe, Bill Nelson, Bill Moffat, Paul Gipe, Don Turkal, Lucy Clark, Donna Rodriguez, Clyde Golden, Kiya and myself.


  Planting natives, especially oak trees, provides benefits that can last literally for centuries. Valley Oaks produce cooling shade, food for wildlife in the form of acorns and leaves, and habitat for birds, mammals and other wildlife. Their leaves enrich the soil beneath them, and their branches capture moisture in the form of condensed fog and dew that falls within the dripline below the canopy. Their roots and limbs sequester carbon as their leaves give off oxygen.


  Valley Oak savannahs, where large trees grow widely spaced among grasslands, or woodlands, where the trees grow closer together, are among California's most distinctive and productive habitats. Since settlers arrived in the Tehachapi Mountains in the 1850s, tens of thousands of these beautiful, durable trees have been cut down. It is both wise and appropriate that we continue planting more Valley Oaks to replace the countless ones that have been lost.


  Have a good week.

Israelis who have returned from trips to China, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Italy are being required to self-quarantine in their homes for 14 days. So far, 10 Israelis have tested positive for the coronavirus.


  Government officials assured voters that they did not need to fear heading to the polls because of the virus.


  “I want to reassure the public and call again to the citizens of Israel: Vote without fear of the coronavirus,” Health Minister Yaacov Litzman said Monday morning. “The coronavirus is under control and the Health Ministry is the only one authorized to update the country on the issue.”


  Israelis are voting for an unprecedented third time in less than a year on Monday after previous rounds of balloting failed to determine a clear winner. Final Israeli news polls ahead of the voting on Monday showed the leading contenders, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the Likud party and Benny Gantz of Blue and White, running neck and neck.


  In September elections, Blue and White won 33 seats to Likud’s 32. In April, Likud took 38 seats to Blue and White’s 35. The latest polls show Likud collecting between 33 and 35 seats and Blue and White taking 33 or 34.

The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) will work round the clock for the major rehabilitation of portions of Roxas Boulevard in the cities of Manila and Pasay, an official said on Friday.


  In a phone interview, DPWH South Manila District engineer Mikunug Macud said the partial rehabilitation works will be conducted on the northbound direction of the major thoroughfare which will start at 10 p.m. of February 28.


  The partial (rehabilitation) works will start this evening. The timeline to complete the project is two to three months, he said.


  The works will cover the outermost northbound lanes of Roxas Boulevard, starting at the 50 meters from the Pasay side of the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (Edsa), and another 50 meters from P. Ocampo Street in the Manila side.


  The repairs cover excavation of old road, road concreting, with drainage improvement and traffic management component.


  (If you are) familiar with Roxas Boulevard, there are portions there that are uneven because of overloading. It will undergo concreting process instead of asphalting the damaged roads, he said.


  Macud said there is no need to have a rerouting scheme on the road since the works will only involve the outermost portion.


  The other lanes are open to motorists, he said.


  Roxas Boulevard is a 5.45 kilometer national road that serves as a major route of cargo truck going in and out of ports in Manila.


  Macud said this is why the road's foundation deteriorates faster than other roads.


  In June last year, a 14 wheeler truck loaded with tons of sand fell into a five foot deep hole at the corner of Roxas Boulevard and Remedios Street in Manila.


  After the completion of the initial repairs on the road, the same will be undertaken on the remaining sections of the northbound lanes as well as the entire four lane southbound direction. (PNA)

In response to the letter in The Argus-Press: I did some fact checking of my own and discovered the writer is right about one thing.
 Just because someone says something, doesn’t make it true. He referred to the Gun Control Act of 1934. Basically that act was nothing more than imposing a $200 tax on anyone who makes, transfers, sells or buys machine-type guns. They did this not just to make money, but to try to limit the number of assault weapons being bought. In 1934 that was a lot of money and it worked for a time, but after a few years, it lost its ability to dissuade.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Recording Academy on Monday fired Deborah Dugan, its former president who called into question the integrity of the Grammy Awards nominations process and said she was sexually harassed by a top lawyer for the organization, which she called a boys' club that coddled and favored powerful men. The academy said the decision was reached after “two exhaustive, costly independent investigations” about Dugan and her allegations. It said the reviews found “consistent management deficiencies and failures,” though no specifics were offered. Dugan had been on administrative leave since mid-January, when she was ousted amid a complaint about her treatment of a longtime Recording Academy employee. Dugan had also raised several issues about the way the organization ran and accused its top lawyers of acting inappropriately toward her during a business meeting, which she detailed in a discrimination complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Dugan's attorneys Douglas H. Wigdor and Michael J. Willemin said in a statement that the academy's decision to fire her and immediately notify media outlets \"further demonstrates that it will stop at nothing to protect and maintain a culture of misogyny, discrimination, sexual harassment, corruption and conflicts of interest.\" “The decision is despicable and, in due course, the Academy, it’s leadership and its attorneys will be held accountable under the law,” the statement said. Dugan’s ouster played out days before the academy's most important night, the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that made no mention of her or her allegations of a rigged voting process for some of the ceremony’s top awards. The academy said it had engaged in some settlement discussions with Dugan but opted to...

“When I was pregnant with my second child, my 70-year-old mother-in-law called to ask if I was still swimming at the public pool,” she wrote. “She had read in a print newsletter that swimming in a public pool could cause birth defects. It didn’t matter that no scientific evidence backed up this article; she wanted me out of that pool.”


  Now, she says, millions of older Americans are getting their news through social media, and they’re falling victim not just to political hoaxes but to the same sorts of health scares that tripped up her mother-in-law.


  “As a member of the over-60 crowd myself,” she wrote, “I believe we must teach older people to be smarter online, and soon.”


  Nash cited a recent YouGov poll in which 44 percent of participants over the age of 65 admitted they had fallen for fake news.


  “If Jefferson was right that only a well-informed citizenry can be trusted with democratic government, then our democracy is in trouble,” she wrote.


  Part of the problem is what the researchers call confirmation bias. The fake news stories tend to confirm what we already believe to be true.


  How can society address the problem?


  Nash suggests offering media literacy classes at public libraries, senior centers and other places where older Americans gather. These classes won’t necessarily teach older Americans how to search the internet as quickly as their grandchildren, but they can offer useful tips such as how to spot questionable websites and where to go to find information you can trust.


  Nash also suggests public awareness campaigns urging older Americans to think twice before spreading false information.


  “We all know an informed democracy is the only way democracy works,” she told NPR. “And if we don’t teach them how to evaluate what they’re seeing, then we are poisoning our electorate.”

Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum.

The USNS Hershel "Woody" Williams is the Navy's second, purpose built ESB. It was delivered to the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command in February 2018. The ship will be converted from a USNS to a USS ship on Saturday. The commissioning of this class of ship allows for greater mission flexibility and is consistent with international law as it is applicable to armed conflicts at sea, including but not limited to mine counter measure operations and special operations forces support. This re-designation provides combatant commanders greater operational flexibility to employ this platform in accordance with the laws of armed conflict.

WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) — A former secretary for Iowa soil and water conservation districts was charged Monday with stealing from the organizations. Leslie Carey was charged with one count of wire fraud, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for Iowa's Northern District. Her attorney filed a notice that she would plead guilty, according to the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. Carey was an administrative aide for the soil and water conservation districts in Black Hawk and Bremer counties from 2007 to 2017. She resigned after an overdrawn account led to a state audit. The audit found Carey withdrew nearly $182,000 in cash from the Black Hawk district and spent $105,000 on debit and credit cards. According to the audit, she used public money for person items, including a new television, water heater, concert tickets and groceries. Carey improperly transferred money from the Bremer district to cover costs in Black Hawk's budget.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point Chancellor Bernie Patterson announced Monday that he'll retire at the end of the year. Patterson has served as chancellor at the central Wisconsin insititution since July 2010. He drew intense criticism from faculty and students in 2019 after his administration proposed eliminating 13 programs to help cope with a $4.5 million deficit. Opponents complained Patterson's staff expanded enrollment and over-hired instead of planning for a leaner future. Patterson said at the time that his administration was leading the school through “necessary changes.” Still, his administration scaled the plan back to eliminating six majors in French, German, history, geography, geoscience and two art concentrations. The administration ultimately scrapped the proposal completely in April 2019, explaning that officials had reduced the university's workforce by about 44 positions, generating $3.5 million in savings.

The free program is run as an informal fellowship with the all-blind group of horses rescued over the years by volunteers and ranch founder and clinical psychologist Emilie Storch of Greensboro.


  Kennedy, 72, places one hand at the base of the Palomino’s neck, the other firm against its side. He closes his eyes and weathers stiff winds in the pasture for two still and silent minutes.


  “I feel the peace, she’s shared with me,’’ Kennedy says, lifting his hands and smoothing Cherokee’s blonde and white coat with a pat. “Now multiply that by 13 — we’ve got 13 in the herd here for vets to bond with — and imagine that. You can feel the comfort of that spiritual being.’’


  Horses, by virtue of millions of years of evolutionary wisdom accrued toward survival, have an uncanny power and real generosity of spirit when it comes to accepting people as exactly who they are.


  “When you come out here to the gate, you are a horse,’’ Kennedy says by the red barn along Lowe Road. “You learn how to exist in their world. I don’t correct them for nothing. Out here, they’re the bosses,’’ Kennedy said, enjoying an unsolicited hug from an older thoroughbred named “Flash.’’


  “What you’ve got to do is befriend them,’’ he said. “And you will not do it until you get _yourself_ under control. Because they can feel anything and everything you are feeling. They will know how you are feeling, especially if you have fear, before you get out of your car,’’ Kennedy said. “They have that kind of intuition and energy.’’


  Over the past six years Kennedy has volunteered and served as caretaker at the ranch, assisting 22 combat veterans of all ages. And to truly aid a fellow soldier, he first must measure a veterans’ comfort around horses, he said.


  “The first thing I do is introduce them to the horses and see what kind of fear level they have,’’ Kennedy said, explaining an encounter, even with a gentle beast, is still a meeting with a 1,400- pound creature. And that can be daunting to a combat veteran already dealing with frayed emotions.


  Through the give and take of winning a horse’s trust, a veteran can learn self-confidence and feel a restored sense of self control, said Kennedy, who connected emotionally with “Fannie,” a stately chestnut mare, about six years ago during one of his first trips to the ranch.


  “Horses have a lot of patience,’’ Kennedy said. “They don’t lie. And you’ve got to be straight with them. They don’t judge you,’’ he said, noting a horse’s heart is seven times the size of a human ticker. “That generates a lot of energy — a calm and peaceful energy. And when you’re around all of these horses, you feel it.’’


  For J. Nohlburg of Madison, a Desert Storm Army vet, communing with the horses of Flurry’s Hope has meant restored happiness and a sense of purpose.


  “Most people in the horse world try to dominate the horses,’’ Nohlburg, 65, said. “The idea here with Mike is that we do what the horses want to do. They are here. They are our family, our friends.’’


  Struggling with a fear of being alone, Nohlburg came to Flurry’s Hope.


  “Actually,”Black Jack” found me,’’ he said of the black and white mottled steed that senses Nohlburg even 30 yards away. “We bonded. He was my introduction to the herd, and because of him, I am now an accepted part of the herd,’’ Nohlburg said. “Black Jack” even routinely pranks Nohlburg by picking up his tools with teeth and walking away with them as Nohlburg works as a ranch volunteer.

We have been mislead into believing we’re sitting on top of an immense fossil fuel fortune — one so vast it will cure all our ills — and that there is an equally immense global demand for our resources.


  And yet, our fossil fuel sector isn’t performing very well. This has been blamed on federal governments (past and present), provincial governments, Indigenous nations, liberals, progressives, the Americans, socialists, the people of Quebec, Greta Thunberg …


  Canada’s oil and gas industry — and their political partners — have blamed seemingly everyone for their misfortune. Except, of course, themselves.


  A more conservative approach would be to assess the situation for what it is — rather than what we’d like it to be — and assume the least complicated answer is likely the correct one. This doesn’t lead down the road of wild conspiracy theories. The oil and gas sector in Canada is suffering first and foremost because they sell an expensive product too few people want to buy.


  The idea that on-going protests in solidarity with the Wet’suwe’ten hereditary chiefs has anything to do with the economics of the global oil market is absurd.


  Teck CEO Don Lindsay correctly identified an important trend in his justification for Frontier’s retracted application: global markets are indeed changing rapidly. Both consumers and investors are increasingly concerned about the negative environmental impact of fossil fuels, and are changing their habits accordingly.


  If people don’t want to buy our oil and gas, we can’t force them.


  This has absolutely nothing to do with the Trudeau administration or what they may or may not know about ‘what it takes’ to run a nation. There are plenty of perfectly valid reasons to criticize Trudeau — his handling of the land dispute chief among them — but he doesn’t control the consumption and investment patterns of the global economy.


  What Trudeau does control is follow-through on his promises, and so far the RCMP still occupy Wet’suwe’ten territory. Had he withdrawn the RCMP as he had promised we probably wouldn’t be dealing with multiple subsequent solidarity protests. The lack of leadership isn’t limited to Trudeau however, several provincial premiers have also shown poor judgement. Quebec Premier François Legault poured oil on the fire by wildly speculating the Mohawk are carrying AK-47s. He provided no evidence. Not one of the dozens of reporters covering these protests have said anything about assault rifles.


  If there’s something to be outraged about, it’s RCMP pointing their assault rifles at Wet’suwet’en grandmothers, or the fact that Canadian taxpayers fork out tens of billions of dollars each and every year to the oil and gas industry. If corporate welfare is bad when it’s given to Bombardier or SNC Lavalin, it’s equally bad when given to Teck or TransCanada.


  No matter how much money the Fed or the governments of BC and Alberta throw at the problem, the oil and gas sector’s performance isn’t improving, and it’s fundamentally because the demand simply doesn’t exist.


  At this rate, we may as well be subsidizing VCR factories.

"However, every once in a while, you're going to see a one-off, you're going to see a 25-year-old person, who looks otherwise well, that's going to get seriously ill. But the vast majority of the people who get into trouble do have these underlying conditions And that's why it confuses people, because they say, 'Well, you just said that, and then there's a report of a 40-year- old physician from China who died.' That's going to happen," he said.

Technical chart claims that Newell Brands Inc. (NWL) would settle between $15.79/share to $16.14/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $14.79 mark, then the market for Newell Brands Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $14.14 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -2.06. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar ended her Democratic presidential campaign on Monday and plans to endorse rival Joe Biden in an effort to unify moderate voters behind the former vice president's White House bid. She is flying to Dallas and plans to join Biden at his rally Monday night, according to her campaign. Klobuchar was the third presidential candidate to drop out of the race in less than 49 hours, following Pete Buttigieg’s departure late Sunday and Tom Steyer's exit late Saturday. Their decisions reflect an urgent push among moderates to consolidate behind Biden as a counter to progressive rival Bernie Sanders. Klobuchar outlasted several better-known and better- funded Democrats, thanks to a better-than-expected third-place finish in in New Hampshire. But she couldn't turn that into success elsewhere, as she struggled to build out a campaign that could compete across the country and had poor showings in the next contests. The three-term senator had one of this cycle's more memorable campaign launches, standing outside in a Minnesota snowstorm last February to tout her “grit” and Midwestern sensibilities. Klobuchar argued that her record of getting things done in Washington and winning even in Republican parts of her state would help her win traditionally Democratic heartland states like Wisconsin and Michigan that flipped in 2016 to give Donald Trump the presidency. She was hoping to own the moderate lane of a Democratic field that grew to some two dozen candidates. But that got much tougher when Biden joined the race in April, starting as a front-runner and remaining there. Klobuchar also was quickly overshadowed by Buttigieg, a fellow Midwesterner who shot from being the largely unknown mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to a top contender on a mix of intelligence, strong oratory and youthful optimism....

Klobuchar outlasted several better-known and better-funded Democrats, thanks to a better-than-expected third-place finish in in New Hampshire. But she couldn't turn that into success elsewhere, as she struggled to build out a campaign that could compete across the country and had poor showings in the next contests.


  The three-term senator had one of this cycle's more memorable campaign launches, standing outside in a Minnesota snowstorm last February to tout her "grit" and Midwestern sensibilities. Klobuchar argued that her record of getting things done in Washington and winning even in Republican parts of her state would help her win traditionally Democratic heartland states like Wisconsin and Michigan that flipped in 2016 to give Donald Trump the presidency.


  She was hoping to own the moderate lane of a Democratic field that grew to some two dozen candidates. But that got much tougher when Biden joined the race in April, starting as a front-runner and remaining there. Klobuchar also was quickly overshadowed by Buttigieg, a fellow Midwesterner who shot from being the largely unknown mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to a top contender on a mix of intelligence, strong oratory and youthful optimism. Buttigieg dropped out on Sunday, saying he no longer had a viable path to the nomination. He has not endorsed anyone.


  Klobuchar entered the race with low name recognition compared with many of her rivals, a disadvantage she was still citing a year into her campaign. Outside Minnesota, the lawyer and former prosecutor was best known for her questioning of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during a 2018 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.


  Klobuchar asked Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexually assaulting a fellow teenager when both were in high school, if he ever had so much to drink that he didn't remember what happened. Kavanaugh retorted, "Have you?" Klobuchar continued, unruffled, and Kavanaugh later apologized to the senator, whose father is recovering from alcoholism.


  Even before she got into the race, Klobuchar was hit with news stories claiming she mistreated her Senate staff, and she had a higher-than-usual turnover rate in her office. Klobuchar said she is a "tough boss" but countered that she has several longtime employees, including the manager of her presidential campaign.


  She also face questions over her prosecutor past. In January, The Associated Press published a story about Klobuchar's office in Minneapolis having prosecuted the case of a black teenager accused of the 2002 shooting death of an 11-year-old girl. Klobuchar has cited the story to show her toughness on crime. But an AP/APM Reports investigation uncovered new evidence and myriad inconsistencies, raising questions about whether Myon Burrell was railroaded by police. The issue followed Klobuchar on the campaign trail, with protesters forcing her to cancel a rally in suburban Minneapolis days before Super Tuesday.

Currently, Pure Storage (PSTG)’s Relative Strength Index (RSI 14) factor is observed at 28.93. Identifying stocks that are overbought or oversold can be an important part of establishing viable trade entries. Though there are a number of indicators that can be used to assess these conditions, some are more popular than others. Two of the most common indicators of overbought or oversold conditions are the relative strength index (RSI) and the stochastic indicators. Each measurement has its strengths and weaknesses but, like most indicators, they are strongest when used in tandem.

In neighboring Virginia, advocates set out on a two-year bipartisan campaign for more transparency, accountability, and affordability in state higher education — some of which is worthy of replication here.


  Last year, Virginia passed legislation that says the state must educate its board members that their “primary duty” is to citizens. This means board members must go beyond their most elementary fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interest of the institution and instead balance the financial comfort of an institution with affordability and accessibility for in-state students, industry needs and taxpayer concerns.


  Such a change here could, as an example, drive board members to reject proposed tuition increases that generate more revenue for institutions but unnecessarily increase the amount of family income North Carolinians pay out of pocket for college, which already stands at near 25% after all financial aid.


  And just recently, Virginia passed a bill that mandates state-delivered biennial training and educational programs for all board members. North Carolina, similarly, should ensure all board members are aware of national best practices and innovations.


  Furthermore, policymakers should require that individual board member votes be recorded on major decisions, making support or opposition to proposals clear to the public, no different from treatment of lawmakers.


  As North Carolina continues to wrestle with major issues like keeping college affordable, strengthening the role of board members who make some of its biggest decisions is a good place to start.

By now, I am really mad and thinking to myself, “That’s it, today is my final day at Xerox. And at the end of the day, I will tell this bozo instructor to stick it, and I am outta here.”


  As the day wore on, I came less mad as I watch everyone else get chastised, so altogether we felt 3 inches tall, because we were all in the same predicament.


  When the day came to a close, I went up to my instructor and said, “What did I do wrong, I really have no idea?”


  He said, “Don’t you ever put something on someone’s desk without asking. It is not your desk.”


  To this day, I will never put something on someone’s desk without asking. He was right and it is still working today.


  Bottom line, Xerox training – all 21 days of it with more than 12 hours per day – taught us how to be pros at selling. They taught us to listen, only sell through questions to find out what the customer wants, not just what I want to sell them. They taught us the true meaning of features and benefits and how and why to cold-call through knocking on doors and using the telephone. They taught us the fundamentals of selling that have never changed and will never change.


  But most important, those three weeks taught me discipline and a strong work ethic, which I continue to hold.
