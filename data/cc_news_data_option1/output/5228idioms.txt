It’s one thing for the hoi polloi (that’s us) to be upset and even to publicly protest the results of an election. But for 17 GOP Attorneys General and 126 elected GOP representatives to sign on to a totally unconstitutional attempt to overturn the will of the people, that is mind-boggling. And Allen West (Texas GOP leader) is suggesting that Texas might want to secede from the Union. What is wrong with the GOP? I expect this from Donald Trump. He is a lunatic. But I did not expect this from Mike Conaway, our elected representative. I did not expect Mr. Conaway to give his assent to trashing the Constitution. And I certainly did not expect 126 representatives of any party to associate themselves with such an attack on the democratic process. I see the GOP dying. And I hope and pray that the GOP that I described dies soon and is buried in an unmarked grave. There don’t seem to be any principles left. It’s Retain power; nothing else matters.

Some thoughts from your local scribe, with Christmas only five days away.
 Oregon football: The Ducks got some nice redemption from a frustrating 2020 Pac-12 season that was shortened due to the coronavirus pandemic with a 31-24 victory over No. 13-ranked Southern California in the conference championship game on Friday night in Los Angeles.
 Oregon (4-2) didn’t even win the Pac-12 North after Washington (3-1) had to cancel their game last week at Autzen Stadium due to COVID-19 issues. The Huskies won the division based on winning percentage, but had to pull out of the Pac-12 championship contest Monday.

The best way to get involved is at the local level. Interested parties can start attending planning and zoning meetings to make their opinion known. They can consider running for public offices, such as county assessor, to gain more sway over rules and regulations in their area. Petitioning those in charge to reconsider zoning regulations can help communities make waves for allowing affordable and sustainable housing initiatives.

My wife’s eyes filled with tears as she heard the news reports that democracy has endured amid repeated failed attempts to invalidate millions of legitimate votes from the presidential election. You see, my wife’s late mother’s name was Democracy. Democracy was born in Italy in 1914, and her father, it seems, had political leanings that were ahead of his time. Democracy arrived in the United States in 1939, just before the start of World War II. Upon hearing Democracy’s name, the naturalization judge who granted her U.S. citizenship determined there was no need to ask her any questions. For the rest of her life, Democracy cherished her American freedoms and was proud to exercise her right to vote. As she showed up every election day without fail, she loved hearing the poll workers proclaim, "Here comes Democracy!"

That includes low-wage “essential” workers in jobs where exposure is highest and people with preexisting conditions that could exacerbate a COVID-19 infection; both groups are largely Black and Latino. Communities of color have been clobbered by outbreaks, as have those living in crowded apartments, group homes, homeless shelters, prisons and jails.
 Yet much of the discussion is focusing solely on which broad group of essential workers should go next.
 On Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to vote on recommendations that designate certain categories of essential workers for the next phase of priority. Later this week, California is expected to finalize its own proposal to prioritize workers in emergency service, education and child care, and food and agriculture, broad categories that include about 5.9 million people.
 Part of the effort to give essential workers priority is to ensure equitable treatment of historically underserved communities, and we appreciate that. These workers too often get short shrift. But not all essential jobs are equally high-risk or have the same level of potential exposure, and not all at-risk people work in essential jobs — and that should be made clear in the guidelines. Protecting the most vulnerable individuals from death, regardless of their perceived value to society or the job they hold, should be a clear and unambiguous priority.

Moderna expects to have between 100 million and 125 million doses available globally in the first three months of 2021, with 85-100 million of those available in the U.S.
 Even with additional candidates in the pipeline, there won’t be enough for the general population until spring, and shots will be rationed in the meantime. And while health workers are enthusiastically embracing vaccination, authorities worry the public may need more reassurance to ensure more people get in line when it’s their turn.
 “Frankly if we don’t succeed in getting 80% or so of Americans immunized against COVID-19 by the middle of this 2021 year, we have the risk that this epidemic could go on and on and on,” Collins said.
 He is especially concerned that accurate information about the shots’ value reaches communities of color, which have been hard-hit by COVID-19 yet also are wary after years of health care disparities and research abuses.
 To try to help instill confidence, Vice President Mike Pence received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot on live TV Friday, along with Surgeon General Jerome Adams.
 Moderna has about 5.9 million doses ready for shipment set to begin over the weekend, according to Operation Warp Speed, the government’s vaccine development program. Injections of health workers and nursing home residents continue next week, before other essential workers and vulnerable groups are allowed to get in line.
 Both Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech’s shots are so-called mRNA vaccines, made with a groundbreaking new technology. They don’t contain any coronavirus – meaning they cannot cause infection. Instead, they use a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spike protein on the surface of the virus, ready to attack if the real thing comes along.

The future of the arrangement with PSEG Long Island or a restructuring of LIPA will affect Long Island’s 1.1 million electric customers and impact approximately 2,000 employees who work hard every day. These men and women — people like linemen and customer service representatives — are dedicated professionals, and it must be heartbreaking for them to not have the appropriate resources to accomplish their jobs.

The initial proposal was for Speke-based King Construction to build the academy, which would have helped hundreds of local unemployed find careers in the road surfacing industry and created 25 jobs for trainers and support staff, and for the multinational firm CEMEX UK to build an asphalt facility.
 The latter, in which CEMEX invested millions of pounds, was opened in 2018.
 The council has said that their support for the scheme met key objectives such as the regeneration of north Liverpool, encouraging private investment, training, growth and job creation. It has also stated that the quality and scale of the proposed training facility had not been agreed.
 King Construction approached the council in 2015 with a view to building a large-scale training academy in the north Liverpool area to help train the unemployed and provide them with careers in road surfacing.

Teleworking has been steadily rising for years as technology has advanced, but the pandemic transformed the landscape overnight. It shifted our understanding of what’s possible and won over many workers and executives who were previously skeptical. Forty-four percent of employers say they feel their employees have been more productive working from home, according to PwC. In addition, companies don’t have to spend significant money on leasing and operating office space.
 However, teleworking’s long-range impact on networking, collaboration and other activities that benefit from face-to-face interaction is not yet known. If it ends up dampening productivity in the long run, it could shrink the economy and depress wages, potentially countering the benefits of lower home prices and less traffic.
 Some of us will return to the office after the pandemic ends, if we haven’t already. But many will go in fewer days a week, and some won’t return at all. Teleworking is now an accepted part of society’s fabric, reshaping not only how we work but also where we live — and transforming the very city we call home.

Changes sourcing, adds DJI statement and blacklisting background)
 Dec 19 (Reuters) - Chinese drone manufacturer SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd, which was added by the United States along with dozens of Chinese companies to a trade blacklist on Friday, said its products will remain on sale despite the blacklisting.
 "DJI is disappointed in the U.S. Department of Commerce's decision", a representative of the company said in an emailed statement. "Customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally."
 The blacklisting of the companies on Friday came as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration ratchets up tensions with China in his final weeks in office.
 Tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated recently amid the handling of the coronavirus, back and forth of sanctions, an ongoing trade war over tariffs and China's imposition of its national security law in Hong Kong.
 U.S. companies are banned from exporting technology to blacklisted companies, which in some cases can block supply chains and make it difficult for U.S. companies to do business with the affected firm. An entity list designation does not bar a company from selling products in the United States.
 The U.S. government has previously raised concerns about DJI and other Chinese makers of drones.
 In January, the U.S. Interior Department said it was grounding its fleet of about 800 Chinese-made drones and earlier halted additional purchases of such drones.
 In May 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned U.S. firms of the risks to company data from Chinese-made drones.
 Separately, U.S. lawmakers this month opted not to ban the purchase of Chinese drone technology by U.S. agencies as part of an annual defense bill.

 Dec 19 (Reuters) - Moderna Inc said on Saturday the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to recommend the use of the company's COVID-19 vaccine on people 18 years of age and older.
 The panel voted 11-0 in favor of the vaccine, the company said in a press release.
 The vote result came a day after the Food and Drug Administration's authorization for emergency use of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine.
 "ACIP recommendation is another step forward in our quest to address this devastating pandemic with a vaccine," Chief Executive Officer Stephane Bancel said in the release.
 Moderna's is the second COVID-19 vaccine to receive approval in the United States after a similar vaccine from Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE got the green light for emergency use.
 U.S. distribution of Moderna's vaccine began on Saturday, with more than 3,700 sites due to start receiving and administering shots as soon as Monday.

 Juventus has drawn half of its 12 Serie A matches. In the last stalemate midweek against Atalanta, Ronaldo had an unusually sub-par performance and a penalty saved.
 “Ronaldo was angry for having missed the penalty, but we had a few days to think about it and he showed how much he cares about scoring goals, even better when during open play,” Juventus coach Andrea Pirlo said.
 “We weren’t happy with Wednesday’s result, but the performance was good. We had to get back the points we lost against Atalanta and we did it in the best way.”
 Kulusevski was given a start against his old club. The 20-year-old midfielder spent last season on loan at Parma, during which he completed a permanent transfer from Atalanta to Juventus.
 Kulusevski was quickest to react to a low cross from Alex Sandro from the left, knocking it into the far bottom corner in the 23rd minute.
 Juventus doubled its lead just three minutes later when Álvaro Morata floated in a cross from the right and Ronaldo leapt up high to head it in.
 Ronaldo had his second three minutes into the second half with an angled drive past Luigi Sepe after being picked out by Aaron Ramsey.
 Morata added the fourth when he headed in Federico Bernardeschi’s cross.

 Simy pulled one back for Crotone from the penalty spot on the stroke of halftime but substitute Fabio Quagliarella restored Samp’s two-goal advantage in the second half, five minutes after coming off the bench.
 Crotone slipped five points from safety after Fiorentina drew against Hellas Verona 1-1. Both teams netted penalties early in the first half.

 TOKYO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Harley Davidson bikers dressed in Santa Claus costumes rode through the streets of central Tokyo on Sunday for their annual parade against child abuse, saying more children were vulnerable in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 The parade, followed by a toy run to donate toys to kids, is a global tradition around Christmas time. In Tokyo, the event is held by members of the "Harley Santa Club", founded in 2008.
 At the parade, bikers said this year's event meant more, because more children were vulnerable to domestic violence during the coronavirus year.
 "Especially because of the coronavirus pandemic this year, I think there are many child abuse cases out of sight," said Takashi Mine, director of the event.
 "It is very likely now that parents will take the stress out on their children after losing their jobs, so I think particularly during the pandemic we have to do the parade," he said.
 The number of child abuse cases in Japan per month rose up to 20% between January and March versus the same period last year, as more families spent time at home because of the pandemic, the daily Asahi Shimbun reported.
 The number of reported child abuse cases was a record high last year, according to the health ministry.
 Normally hundreds of motorcyclists take part in the parade, but because of coronavirus only about 100 rode this year.
 Still, riders proudly roared their engines to bring Christmas joy to kids living in children's homes. Riders plan to visit four homes in Tokyo this year to donate toys and candy to about 400 children. (Writing by Ju-min Park; Editing by Michael Perry)

Defending champion Sei Young Kim of South Korea took advantage of moving day at the CME Group Tour Championship on Saturday to slide into the top spot on the leaderboard after Round 3 in Naples, Fla.
 The Rolex Rankings No. 2 player in the world carded a 5-under 67 at Tiburon Golf Club to move to 13-under 203 and take a one-shot lead over fellow countrywoman and world No. 1 Jin Young Ko (69), who held the lead going into Saturday.
 Kim carded six birdies over her first 13 holes then seemed to level off before dropping shot to the field with a three-putt bogey on 18.
 "I had (birdies at) Nos. 10 and 11, and then 13," said Kim. "But I try to keep the same momentum, but it was tough at 13. So, yeah, I try to finish strong, but I had three-putt the hole 18, so I just, yeah, little disappointed with that. I just keep it up tomorrow."
 Ko's bogey-free round included three birdies, at Nos. 3, 7 and 17, and satisfied her goal for the day.
 "I just try to make a birdies, and then I said yesterday my goal is like just bogey-free round on the weekend, so I made it today," said Ko, 25, who played her way into this week's LPGA season finale with just three starts in 2020. "I'm looking forward to tomorrow."
 Britain's Georgia Hall shot 68 on Saturday to move into solo third place at 10 under. After making the turn at 1 over, Hall posted five birdies over holes 11-17 to make a move of her own.
 "I hit it pretty good today as well. I just didn't hole many on the front nine, so I had to stay patient," she said.
 "(I) managed to get a couple early in the back nine and then just followed in from there really. Very happy with my back nine to get me especially into contention for tomorrow."
 Rounding out the top five in a tie for fourth place at 9 under are Canada's Brooke Henderson (66), Britain's Charley Hull (66), Australia's Minjee Lee (66) and American's Austin Ernst (69) and Lexi Thompson (71), the first-round leader.
 Four players are tied for ninth at 8 under including Cristie Kerr and Mina Harigae, and Australia's Lydia Ko and Hannah Green. Ko, the 2014 champion, also holds the 18-hole scoring record at Tiberon (second-round 62 in 2016).
 There is no cut for the 72-player field, who all have an equal chance at the $1.1 million winner's prize, the largest in 2020.

SYDNEY, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Josh Hazlewood has sometimes been overshadowed by his fellow members of Australia's bowling attack, but at Adelaide Oval on Saturday he stepped firmly into the limelight with a blinding spell that humiliated India in the first test.
 Working in tandem with Pat Cummins, the world's top-ranked bowler, Hazlewood bagged the most economical five-wicket haul by an Australian bowler in 73 years as India were bundled out for 36, their lowest ever innings score.
 The big quick from rural New South Wales bowled three maidens in his five overs, dismissing Mayank Agarwal, Ajinkya Rahane, Wriddhiman Saha, Ravichandran Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari at the cost of just eight runs.
 A committed team man, his first instinct was to pay tribute to Cummins for taking the first three wickets, although his partner did report that at one stage Hazlewood cheekily suggested he might take more wickets than concede runs.
 "(We knew we had) something special going, and I just felt like if we kept bowling in those areas that nicks were going to keep coming," Hazlewood recalled after the match.
 "We just didn't let up really. It was just one of those days when everything went to plan, we kept putting it in on that spot and the nicks kept coming.
 "It happened so quickly, it was over before we knew it."
 The dismissal of Ashwin gave Hazlewood his 200th test wicket, the 17th Australian to reach the milestone.
 The speed of the India collapse meant Mitchell Starc, the other member of Australia's pace-bowling triumvirate, bowled only three early overs and never returned.
 Australia duly romped to an eight-wicket victory over the shell-shocked tourists inside three days to take a 1-0 lead in the four-test series.
 It was a remarkable turnaround to a test match which had been finely poised after two days. Hazlewood admitted the Australians had been as surprised as anyone.
 "We were probably a bit more stunned when we came off from bowling," the 29-year-old said. "The mood didn't change too much throughout the whole game to be fair." (Reporting by Nick Mulvenney; Editing by William Mallard)

La prima spina nel fianco dei biancorossi si chiama Eliantonio che firma subito lo 0-4 provocando la reazione di Villa dalla lunga. La prima tripla di Sesoldi (chiudera col 57% dalla lunga) e quella dell'8 pari in una fase nella quale le due squadre si studiano tanto che al 10′ sono sul 20-16. Un botta e risposta Guaiana Restelli dalla lunetta riapre le danze con Falaschi che, con un bellissimo movimento sul perno, firma il 25-23. E' qui che entra prepotentemente in scena Crespi. Con una stoppata, un assist al bacio a Vanin e tanti rimbalzi, il pivot firma il primo mini-allungo sul 35-31 con Villa che, sulla sirena, firma il 37-31. Al ritorno in campo, a cose normali, il pubblico della Lazzeri avrebbe assistito a tutta la frazione in piedi perche la Computer Gross rasenta la perfezione. Finira 34-14 con coach Fabbri che, in un paio di occasioni, prova a chiamare timeout senza pero riuscire a frenare gli avversari. 'Murato' il canestro, c'e gloria per tutti, dal solito Villa, a Restelli, ad Antonini che come alza la mano fa canestro a Restelli che suggella il parziale con due triple, quelle del 71-45. Nel finale c'e solo da controllare, ma l'Use tiene comunque la guardia difensiva alta lasciando poi briglia sciolta in attacco dove Sesoldi fra 3/3 dalla lunga, Villa distribuisce assist e canestri ed il giovane Mazzoni, nel finale, partecipa alla festa. La Computer Gross festeggia il Natale con un 90-68 che parla da solo e si prepara cosi al nuovo anno che iniziera con la doppia trasferta di Cecina e Firenze.

Khalid Tawab was of the view that COVID-19, in a way, further highlighted the fundamental weaknesses of Pakistan's economy such as low tax to GDP ratio, reduced savings rate and minimal export growth with negligible value addition etc. while the industrial sector regressed. However, the present government responded promptly to such issues by reforming policy measures; introducing smart lockdowns instead of bringing all the economic activities to a standstill.
 "Since business community is the backbone of the economy and we acknowledge the government's efforts to facilitate the businesses and industry. We support Imran Khan's vision of much-needed revitalization of the economy and industry," he assured.
 He, however, added that though the PTI government was committed to increase the exports and improve trade activities in the country, stakeholders of many sectors of economy were being ignored by the policy makers.
 He urged the authorities concerned to ensure representation of all stakeholders while framing future economic policies and trade related decisions so as to make them viable.
 On this occasion, Pervaiz Lala VP candidate from Punjab demanded of the government to extend the construction package for one year so that huge investment injected in this industry could bear fruits. He assured that all problems being confronted by business community would be addressed on top priority by the UBG at the Federation's platform.
 Malik and the UBG candidates expressed the resolve that if the UBG panel voted to power, it would continue to safeguard interests of the trade and industry at all levels.
 They assured the voters that a special cell would be established to monitor the industry's losses in the ongoing COVID-19 so that another additional package could be obtained from the government to help sustain and stabilize the industry on top priority.
 They also appealed to the businessmen and industrialists to strictly adhere to SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) issued by the government time to time with the resurgence of the deadly virus so that they could save themselves and others from this pandemic.

Cristiano Ronaldo responded to recent criticism with two goals to help Juventus win at Parma 4-0 in Serie A on Saturday.
 Dejan Kulusevski scored Juve’s opener against his old club as the nine-time defending champion moved level with Inter Milan, a point behind leader AC Milan.
 Both Milan sides play on Sunday, when the Rossoneri travels to Sassuolo and Inter hosts Spezia.
 Juventus has drawn half of its 12 Serie A matches. In the last stalemate midweek against Atalanta, Ronaldo had an unusually sub-par performance and a penalty saved.
 “Ronaldo was angry for having missed the penalty, but we had a few days to think about it and he showed how much he cares about scoring goals, even better when during open play,” Juventus coach Andrea Pirlo said.
 “We weren’t happy with Wednesday’s result, but the performance was good. We had to get back the points we lost against Atalanta and we did it in the best way.”
 Kulusevski was given a start against his old club. The 20-year-old midfielder spent last season on loan at Parma, during which he completed a permanent transfer from Atalanta to Juventus.
 Kulusevski was quickest to react to a low cross from Alex Sandro from the left, knocking it into the far bottom corner in the 23rd minute.
 Juventus doubled its lead just three minutes later when Álvaro Morata floated in a cross from the right and Ronaldo leapt up high to head it in.
 Ronaldo had his second three minutes into the second half with an angled drive past Luigi Sepe after being picked out by Aaron Ramsey.
 Morata added the fourth when he headed in Federico Bernardeschi’s cross.

 Bottom club Crotone’s recent run of positive results was halted at Sampdoria in a 3-1 loss.

 Simy pulled one back for Crotone from the penalty spot on the stroke of halftime but substitute Fabio Quagliarella restored Samp’s two-goal advantage in the second half, five minutes after coming off the bench.
 Crotone slipped five points from safety after Fiorentina drew against Hellas Verona 1-1. Both teams netted penalties early in the first half.

For something so profoundly human, singing retains a degree of mystery. The music making happens largely out of sight, inside the body, as subtle internal movements shape a column of breath.
 No one can truly show you how to sing. Piano teachers can demonstrate where to place your fingers on the keyboard. Voice teachers describe posture, breathing technique and vocal exercises. But mainly, they conjure forth music using imagery. Envision sound spilling from the top of your head, a teacher may say.
 Imagine the song pouring out of you in a constant stream, like water, a singing teacher once told me. When one singer joins others, that river widens exponentially. And when voices combine and a shimmering chord rises from the group, each singer feels the lift, like a swelling wave.
 Like millions of others, I’m addicted to those soaring harmonies. Before the pandemic, some 54 million Americans took part in group singing. That’s 1 in 6 of us. I grew up singing in choirs, choruses and musicals, and chose a college, Yale, steeped in singing, where choirs performed gorgeous cantatas and entryways rang with Cole Porter tunes.

Each of the four seats flipped to Democratic control in 2018 amid a wave election that was largely a repudiation of Trump. Only time will tell whether Republicans can maintain their support in the districts or whether the areas are up for grabs every two years.
 “Historically, these four have been Republican seats,” said Darry Sragow, a longtime Democratic political strategist and publisher of the California Target Book, who said the GOP gains are not the sign of a comeback for the party. “The fact that they’re back in Republican hands should under no circumstances be viewed as an unexpected and shocking development.”
 Republicans recruited candidates who resonated with voters, Democrats acknowledge. Kim, along with Michelle Steel in the 48th district, will be among the first Korean American women elected to Congress. They will both represent districts with sizable Asian American populations. Valadao, the former member of Congress, retained strong name recognition in the Central Valley. And Mike Garcia is a Latino former Navy fighter pilot. “I would be hard pressed to find a candidate who tests better with voters,” Sragow said of Garcia.
 While each race was slightly different, Republicans positioned themselves as the answer to a gridlocked Washington. They accused Democrats of trying to defund the police and of supporting socialism — messages that Democrats reject as false but which appear to have resonated with Asian American voters in the 39th and 48th districts, with the expansive Latino population in the 21st district and with voters who had law enforcement or military backgrounds in the 25th. Meanwhile, Republicans tiptoed around their support for Trump, saying they didn’t always agree with him, and then redirected the focus to local issues.

 The Sharks missed the playoffs, and their status is in limbo because Santa Clara County has banned contact sports through at least Jan. 8. The Sharks will follow in the steps of the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers, who are closing out their season in Arizona.
 The Sharks said they had no comment “at this point” on relocating to Arizona.
 In an email to the AP, NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly deferred questions to the Sharks regarding their status. Daly added he was unable to share many details of the plan because the league has yet to brief its general managers.
 As for the issues affecting the Canadian teams — Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver — Daly said they remain unresolved. Discussions are to continue through the weekend.
 If health officials approve the NHL’s plan, the seven teams would compete in a new Canadian Division.

The Freshwater Fishing Forecast for the fourth week of December gives anglers the tough fishing days of the month. The first quarter moon occurs Monday which will improve fishing slightly, and a typical winter weather pattern is forecasted.
 Today a perfect south wind will turn on fish feeding activity during the three solar periods. The moon is at its weakest position this week and will have little if any effect on triggering fish feeding migrations. Therefore I believe fish will feed during the solar noon period instead of the daily lunar periods this week. As water temperatures peak at the daily high mark, so too will fish metabolisms peak at their daily high speed and trigger feeding.
 A low pressure system will progressively produce clouds and rainfall by this evening. Winds will switch from the south to the west northwest Monday morning as a high pressure system enters the state with wind speed climbs to a twelve to fourteen mph range. Tuesday a mild north wind occurs and changes to a ten mph east wind on Wednesday.

Adds Guardiola quotes)
 Dec 19 (Reuters) - Manchester City closed the gap on the Premier League top four after Raheem Sterling's first-half goal proved enough to secure a hard- fought 1-0 victory over Southampton at St Mary's on Saturday.
 After a spell of constant pressure, City broke the deadlock in the 16th minute when playmaker Kevin De Bruyne's cross from the right wing found Sterling, who slotted the ball past Saints goalkeeper Alex McCarthy.
 Southampton threatened to equalise through James Ward-Prowse's set-piece deliveries but the hosts lacked a focal point in attack after striker Danny Ings was forced off with an injury just five minutes before halftime.
 Bernardo Silva missed an opportunity to double City's lead early in the second half, while Southampton had an appeal for a penalty for handball against Sterling waved away by VAR.
 De Bruyne and substitute Riyad Mahrez also saw opportunities go begging as City failed to add to the scoreline in the second half but the visitors were composed at the back to seal victory and move up to fifth in the league table.
 It was more about the result than performance for Pep Guardiola's City as they now find themselves one point behind fourth-placed Southampton and eight adrift of leaders Liverpool, having played one game fewer than both.
 "We had the momentum in the second half, but we couldn't score and we nearly suffered," Guardiola said.
 "Defensively we were excellent. Last season we struggled a lot. Ruben (Dias) has helped us a lot. John (Stones) in the last few games has been exceptional."
 Sterling was delighted with his team's reaction after they played out back-to- back draws against West Bromwich Albion and Manchester United over the last seven days.
 "Trying to win games and score goals has been difficult for us," Sterling, who scored his fourth league goal of the season, said.
 "We had a word with ourselves, dug deep and found something from within. We're a top football club and we weren't where we needed to be at.
 "We knew how important it was to win today, and we're happy to get the three points." (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru Editing by Toby Davis and Pritha Sarkar)

Each family got what they needed, no questions asked, no judgment made, said Akiyyah Billups, executive director of Frederick March For Justice.
 "This is a we project," Aje Hill said to a group of volunteers before the event's start. "If they look at you like that one box isn't enough, give them another box."
 Hill is director of I Believe In Me, a mentorship and leadership development nonprofit that has worked with organizations throughout the pandemic to feed more than 50,000 Frederick County residents. When he heard Frederick March For Justice had a coat drive planned, he jumped at the chance to add food to the donations.
 “As we know, through this pandemic, people are struggling to pay the light bill, the rent, phone, so hope’s something that right now is essential," Hill said. He called the people at Lincoln that day "hope dealers."
 Billups believes the more groups that come together for the community, the better.
 “You’re going to make a bigger impact, the more people come together to offer services," she said.

 # CalMatters Commentary: Vaccine rollout could make or break Newsom
 Dan Walters
 CalMatters Commentary
 View Comments
 Nearly halfway through his first term, Gavin Newsom faces a critical period that could make or break his governorship.
 After climbing the political ladder to the governor’s office, Newsom intended to make his mark with “big hairy audicious goals,” such as ending homelessness and creating a single-payer health care program.
 However, scarcely a year after inauguration, and without making much progress on anything hairy or audacious, Newsom was forced to pivot into managing a response to the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.
 It’s not the role he sought, but it’s the one that likely will define his governorship.
 To date, his managerial record has been spotty at best and chaotic at worst. Since issuing his first emergency order in March, Newsom has taken the state’s 40 million residents on a rollercoaster ride.
 He initially imposed restrictions that shut down much of the economy and threw hundreds of thousands, even millions, out of work, then relaxed them two months later only to crack down again in July, and ease up a few weeks later. Finally, this month, he clamped down again as the state’s infection and death rates soared and hospitals were nearly overwhelmed with patients.
 Newsom insists that his actions are based in science, but some decrees on what was shut down and what was allowed to remain open defied simple logic and seemed to be dictated by which sectors were deemed expendable and which would cause a political backlash.
 Through it all, Newsom made regular appearances on internet webcasts to explain, or so he said, what was happening, but they were mostly repetitive talkathons filled with jargon and jumbles of numbers, rather than straightforward messages to a confused and frightened public.
 Worst of all, as Newsom was beseeching Californians to wear their masks and avoid infection-spreading gatherings, he was caught on camera having an intimate dinner, sans masks, with some Capitol lobbyists at a very expensive restaurant in Napa.
 Newsom apologized after the San Francisco Chronicle revealed the dinner, but the damage was done. He was exposed as a hypocrite who exempted himself and his cronies from the personal restrictions he wanted everyone else to follow.
 Newsom now has a chance to redeem himself, at least partially, as long-awaited coronavirus vaccines begin to be administered. Once again he’s begging Californians to obey the personal behavior guidelines he had violated.
 “This is the beginning of the end,” Newsom tweeted. “We can do this. Wear a mask. Stay home as much as possible. Let’s crush this curve and get to the finish line.”
 The vaccine rollout will be critical not only to Californians and their battered economy, but to Newsom’s tarnished image. If it goes smoothly, he’ll bask in the glow of success. But if there are major glitches — if inoculation becomes another managerial catastrophe like the Department of Motor Vehicles or the Employment Development Department — it will be hung around his neck.
 A recall movement lurks in the background and seems to be benefiting from the restaurant incident. The state Republican Party and other conservative groups say they are more than halfway toward the 1.5 million signatures needed to put a recall on the ballot with three months to go in their 160-day window.
 Eighteen years ago, those who wanted to recall then-Gov. Gray Davis were roughly in the same boat until Darrell Issa, a wealthy Republican congressman, contributed enough money to place the recall on the ballot, culminating in Davis’ ouster and the election of action movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger.
 Those who want to short-circuit Newsom’s career are looking for another angel with deep pockets and if they are successful, Newsom’s management of COVID-19 could face a direct referendum next year.

WELLINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Light winds played havoc with the final day of competitive sailing before the America's Cup challenger series starts on Jan. 15, with the first race on Sunday between defenders Team New Zealand and Ainslie's Team INEOS UK abandoned.
 Team New Zealand were within 200 metres (220 yards) of the finish line in the race that was shortened to four legs, with Ben Ainslie's Britannia still on their second leg having been lapped when the 45-minute time limit expired.
 Both boats were off their foils and Ainslie found the funny side of the situation as they stalked TNZ while they headed downwind before the race was abandoned.
 "It's one of those days," Ainslie said. "The only fun for us was the displacement race heading back down with the Kiwis.
 "A bit of old-school sailing."
 Officials ordered the race to be restarted after the match between Italy's Luna Rossa and American Magic, although the start of that race was also delayed due to the fickle winds.
 The British challenge has floundered in the light winds in the pre-Christmas regatta, which included the America's Cup World Series that ended on Saturday and was won by TNZ.
 Sunday's racing was part of the one-day 'Christmas Cup' where the teams were seeded according to their placings in the World Series and guaranteed two races each.

After 9/11 and Superstorm Sandy, it was those writing obituaries for New York City who grabbed the headlines, but time and time again, they were proven wrong.
 New York is strong and resilient, and we always rise from the ashes. I believe we will again, but we need your help.
 Before our city became America’s first coronavirus hotspot, New York and its surrounding metropolitan area was an engine of incredible economic strength. For the fiscal year ending in March 2020, the state controller reported that the state had a GDP 29.5% higher than the national average, representing 7% of the nation’s economic output.
 The Bureau of Economic Analysis’ most recent data shows the New York metropolitan area with the highest real GDP in the country. More than two million people occupied office jobs in Manhattan alone, not to mention the world-class dining, hospitality, Broadway and entertainment industries that call New York City their home.
 That number is only set to grow as New York City has come to rival Silicon Valley in technology and innovation. Prior to, and even during, the pandemic, companies like Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google expanded their New York footprint, hiring more than 22,000 workers. The new Cornell Tech Campus on Roosevelt Island will continue to bring new, innovative jobs to the city, as it is expected to span 12 acres by 2037.
 Record numbers of tourists, both from around the country and around the world, choose New York City as a travel destination. In 2019 alone, more than 66 million visitors came to experience the vibrancy of our city through our architecture, restaurants, theater and the unique hospitality that only New York can provide.
 However, because of the pandemic, practically none of those trips were taken in 2020. This sudden drop, in what had been a consistently growing sector, has affected hundreds of thousands of jobs in those industries that rely heavily on tourism, not to mention the businesses, small and large alike, whose owners have invested everything they have into creating the one-of-a-kind experiences that put New York City on the map.
 New York City has the potential to not only return to its pre-pandemic glory but build upon it in exciting ways, as long as the federal government partners with us.

If it were ever possible to put the enormities which have taken place since last March down to mere blundering, it certainly is not now.

The NHS has regularly survived winter flu seasons which saw beds lined up in corridors and staff rushed off their feet.

NEW DELHI, Dec 20 (Reuters) - A cricket-mad India reacted with shock and disbelief on Sunday after Virat Kohli's men registered the country's lowest test innings score in the opening day-night contest against Australia in Adelaide.
 More than the eight-wicket defeat inside three days, it was the spectacular meltdown of India's vaunted batting lineup in the second innings which dominated discussion in India.
 A photo of Kohli with lowered head was printed on the front page of the Times of India newspaper, along with the 10 single-digit scores recorded by the Indian batsmen who were dismissed for 36.
 "No this is not a phone number. It's the score of the Indian line-up (in order of dismissal) in the 2nd innings at Adelaide," the newspaper said.
 Former test opener Virender Sehwag also listed the single-digit scores and suggested a cheeky way to banish the memory of this debacle.
 "The OTP to forget this is 49204084041," he tweeted.
 The Indian Express printed the photo of the manual scoreboard at the Adelaide Oval on its front page reflecting India's batting capitulation in the day- night test.
 The daily called it a "Day & Nightmare Test" and devoted an entire page to mourn "The Great Indian Batting Collapse."
 Fans on social media wondered how the India team, sponsored by a learning app, could fail a test.
 Some former players were more sympathetic though.
 "With the way India batted & bowled in the 1st innings, they were in the driver's seat, but the Aussies came back really hard..." tweeted batting great Sachin Tendulkar.
 "That is the beauty of Test cricket. It's NEVER over till it's over. India was outclassed in the 2nd half. Congratulations to Australia!"
 The four-test series continues with matches scheduled in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. (Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; Editing by Stephen Coates)

Updates after racing abandoned)
 WELLINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Light winds played havoc with the final day of competitive sailing before the America's Cup challenger series starts on Jan. 15, with only one of Sunday's four scheduled races able to be started but abandoned after it exceeded the 45-minute limit.
 Races cannot start unless the wind is a minimum of 6.5 knots (12 kph), and while the superfast AC75 monohulls have shown they can achieve more than three times the wind speed, they need to generate at least 15 knots of speed to get up on their foils.
 Race officials called off the day's racing shortly before 6 p.m. (0500 GMT) after abandoning the first race between defenders Team New Zealand (TNZ) and Ben Ainslie's Team INEOS UK.
 TNZ were within 200 metres (220 yards) of the finish line in the race that was shortened to four legs, with Ainslie's Britannia still on their second leg, having been lapped when the time limit expired.
 Both boats were off their foils and Ainslie found the funny side as they stalked TNZ while they headed downwind before the race was abandoned.

 LIVERPOOL, England, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Arsenal's dreadful Premier League season continued with a 2-1 defeat to resurgent Everton at Goodison Park leaving the Gunners five points above the relegation zone.
 Colombian Yerry Mina grabbed the winner with a header from a corner on the stroke of halftime after a Nicolas Pepe penalty had brought the Gunners level following Everton's opener from a Rob Holding own goal.
 Everton move up to second place after their third straight win, following victories over Chelsea and Leicester that has seen them recapture their early season form.
 The Merseysiders lost four times in October and November but are unbeaten in four games and back in the hunt at the top of the table.
 "We did very well in the last few games. Brilliant performances and fantastic results. We have shown more consistency," said Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti.
 "This season we started well, then we had a difficult moment, but right now I'm really pleased," said the Italian, who marked his first year in charge of the side.
 Everton took the lead in the 22nd minute when an Alex Iwobi cross was met with a header from Dominic Calvert-Lewin which flew in via a deflection from Arsenal defender Holding.
 Mikel Arteta's side drew level, against his former club, through a Pepe penalty in the 35th minute, awarded after a Tom Davies foul on Ainsley Maitland-Niles.
 But the Toffees restored their advantage on the stroke of halftime when Yerry Mina timed his run to perfection to angle in a near post header from a Gylfi Sigurdsson corner.
 It was a goal which again highlighted Arsenal's struggles at set-pieces and Calvert-Lewin confirmed that was an area they had looked to exploit.
 "We targeted the near post, that's where their weakness is and we got a goal from it," said the Everton striker.
 David Luiz had a deflected shot hit the post and Everton keeper Jordan Pickford had to make a last gasp save to keep out a close-range effort from Bukayo Saka as Everton faced a late push from the visitors.
 Everton are second, on 26 points, five behind leaders Liverpool while the Gunners, who have eight losses from 14 matches, are 15th on 14 points.
 Arsenal's start is their worst since the 1974-75 season but Arteta, who has lost 13 and won 13 from his 34 games in charge, said his team were still up for the fight.
 "The boys are absolutely still fighting. They're hurt right now," he said.
 "We lost the game on two key moments. We dominated the game. We created enough chances at least to not lose," he added.
 "We are in a big fight. We lost against Burnley without them having a shot on target, and now we lose because of a couple of chances. We need to generate more to win football matches. When it comes to small details, the other team wants it more." (Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Pritha Sarkar)

 Dec 19 (Reuters) - Manchester City closed the gap on the Premier League top four after Raheem Sterling's first-half goal proved enough to secure a hard- fought 1-0 victory over Southampton at St Mary's on Saturday.
 After a spell of constant pressure, City broke the deadlock in the 16th minute when playmaker Kevin De Bruyne's cross from the right wing found Sterling, who slotted the ball past Saints goalkeeper Alex McCarthy.
 Southampton threatened to equalise through James Ward-Prowse's set-piece deliveries but the hosts lacked a focal point in attack after striker Danny Ings was forced off with an injury just five minutes before halftime.
 Bernardo Silva missed an opportunity to double City's lead early in the second half, while Southamptom had an appeal for a penalty for handball against Sterling waved away by VAR.
 De Bruyne and substitute Riyad Mahrez also saw opportunities go begging as City failed to add to the scoreline in the second half but the visitors were composed at the back to seal victory and move up to fifth in the league table.
 It was more about the result than performance for Pep Guardiola's City as they now find themselves one point behind fourth-placed Southampton and eight adrift of leaders Liverpool, having played one game fewer than both.
 Sterling was delighted with his team's reaction after they played out back-to- back draws against West Bromwich Albion and Manchester United over the last seven days.
 "Trying to win games and score goals has been difficult for us," Sterling, who scored his fourth league goal of the season, said.
 "We had a word with ourselves, dug deep and found something from within. We're a top football club and we weren't where we needed to be at.
 "We knew how important it was to win today, and we're happy to get the three points." (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru Editing by Toby Davis and Pritha Sarkar)

 HONG KONG, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Head coach Yahya Golmohammadi vowed not to allow Persepolis' second Asian Champions League final defeat in three campaigns to derail the club from moving forward after the Iranians saw South Korea's Ulsan Hyundai claim the continental crown on Saturday.
 The 2-1 loss in front of a socially-distanced crowd of around 8,000 fans at the Al Janoub Stadium in Doha came two years after a defeat at the hands of Japan's Kashima Antlers to leave the Iranian side still seeking an elusive first-ever Asian Champions League title.
 Persepolis' hopes were hampered by the loss through suspension of key striker Issa Alekasir and midfielders Ehsan Pahlavan and Vahid Amiri, and Golmohammadi admitted his squad's lack of depth made the task against a talented Ulsan side more challenging.
 "Having replacement players is important; today, we did not have many options to come off the bench. The players we missed today like Amiri and Pahlevan had an impact and we could not replace them," he said.
 "It is very difficult. There will be difficult days ahead of us, but this is football. It would be unprofessional if this result becomes an obstacle in our way.
 "We have to start our mental and psychological recovery from tomorrow and be ready to go again for the 2021 Asian Champions League and the Iran Pro League."
 Despite the absence of vital players, it was Persepolis who took the lead when young striker Mehdi Abdi struck from just inside the penalty area.
 But a pair of penalties swung the game in Ulsan's favour, with Junior Negrao netting his side's first goal on the rebound after Hamed Lak had saved his spot-kick in first half injury time before the Brazilian hit the decisive second 10 minutes into the second half.
 "We lost the match the moment we lost our concentration," said Golmohammadi of the penalties that handed Ulsan victory.
 "We made sure we did not concede goals in any way, but we gave them two easy chances to score.
 "I am really sad and I want to apologise to all the fans of Persepolis for our shortcomings. The players fought until the end, but we could not win." (Reporting by Michael Church, Editing by Michael Perry)

Monroe County commissioners discussed next moves for Monroe County in light of the governor's announcement during the BOCC virtual meeting today. The commissioners appeared generally in favor of following the governor's phase 1 plan, although the County does have the authority to be more restrictive. Commissioners emphasized the importance of maintaining the roadway checkpoints that block visitors to the Keys because the counties to the north have high numbers of COVID-19 positive residents and are still experiencing a steady increase in the numbers of cases.
