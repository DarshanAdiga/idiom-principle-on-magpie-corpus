General Hospital fans are both surprised and happy to see that there is so much hope for Tracy and Olivia. Tracy has gone to her and asked her if they can potentially put the past in the past. We know that this will never be an easy thing for them to do, but it is possible that they can do it and make it work for them. We suspect that they might have a chance at getting to a place where they can be around one another and enjoy it, but it will take some time. We know that this is important to Tracy, though, after the advice she gave Ned earlier in the week. She wants all of these people to be good and happy together, and we think she can make that happen if she puts her mind to it. But, that’s just one of those things that might make a bigger difference elsewhere.

In what has been one of the darkest seasons for the North Carolina basketball program in recent years, it perhaps hit rock bottom, or somewhere near it, as a double-digit lead with less than two minutes to go in regulation melted away to force overtime. In the extra period, the Tigers claimed their first lead of the game and accomplished something the previous 59 Clemson squads couldn't do in Chapel Hill -- win, and it did so for a 79-76 victory.

Wake Forest coach Danny Manning said that Carey's presence, and the Demon Deacons' guarding of him, is part of the reason Duke got so many open looks, and that alone was a big impact on the game; that's true.

Lydia and her son suffer hunger, threats of physical harm and other indignities just like all the other migrants, including Rebeca and Soledad, two young women from Honduras who become their faithful traveling companions. Lydia, however, is blessed by one stroke of luck after another: from being able to obtain hefty funds from her dead mother’s bank account, to being able to pass as a member of a missionary group (because of her fair features), to finding the right ally in the most dire of situations.
 It’s a bit cinematic but indicative of the kinds of privileges that set Lydia apart from her fellow travelers. Yes, she faces the same perils, but as a Mexican citizen of means and an education, she has resources and connections that the others don’t.
 Cummins’ decision to center the story on Lydia is a good decision, and I wish the book had remained a narrative about a woman who is willing to do the impossible to save her son. If hopping on La Bestia, the Train of Death, with her child in tow is what it takes to secure his well-being, then Lydia stands as a true testament to the strength and power of motherhood.

Hurston was born in Notasulga, Alabama, in 1891 and moved with her family to Florida at age 3. She later worked as a maid, waitress and other jobs before enrolling at Howard University in 1920. Five years later, Hurston moved to Manhattan in 1925 and lived off and on there until the late 1930s. She would come to be identified with the Harlem Renaissance, but she was ever an iconoclast who stood apart from her peers and the so-called “New Negro” movement of the time.
