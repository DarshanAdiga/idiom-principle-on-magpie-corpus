Living without a permanent roof over your head or, worse, sleeping rough is hard enough during ‘normal’ times. During a public emergency such as this, the position is far worse.
 Right from the start Ipswich Borough Council has made looking after vulnerable residents a priority. This is why we block-booked rooms for more than 30 people in a local hotel and put others up in bed and breakfast accommodation to ensure no one had to sleep rough on the streets of Ipswich during this crisis.

National   Geographic Channel on Monday announced its 2012-13 programming slate under its   new executive team, including five new series and a number of specials and   events.
 New   President Howard T. Owens,   a former Reveille exec, outlined a strategy shift from one-off specials to male   character-fronted series to up the entertainment quotient of Nat Geo's   programming.
 As   such, the five new series joining Nat Geo are _American Chainsaw_ , about a New England chainsaw sculptor; _Bid & Destroy_, which follows a   demolition crew that searches for hidden treasure; _Brain Games_ , spun-off from the net's three-part special last fall   which explores the ways your brain fools you; _Jersey Combat_ , about the world's largest military warehouse and the   family that owns it; and the previously announced _Are You Tougher Than a Boy Scout?,_ the net's first competition series.
 NGC   has also renewed seven existing series -- _Alaska   State Troopers_, _Border Wars_ , _Hard Time_ , _Locked Up Abroad_ , _Rocket City   Rednecks_, _Taboo_ , and _Doomsday Preppers._
 The   new team is also looking to make their specials larger, tentpole events by   tapping big-name production talent just as it is doing on the series side with _Boy Scout_ , which is from Thom Beers'   Original Productions, and Pilgrim Studios' upcoming _Wicked Tuna_.
 "We're   changing the way we do business in terms of communicating and working with the   creative industry," Owens said. "I think our new slate reflects high   entertainment value that's authentic and thoughtful and smart."
 Headlining   NGC's 10 specials for the 2012-13 season is James Cameron's _Deepsea Challenge_ , where the   Oscar-winning director travels to 6.8 miles beneath sea level to the deepest   spot on earth, the bottom of the Mariana Trench.
 Other   big names include producers include Ridley and Tony Scott on the historical   thriller event _Killing Lincoln_ , based   on the best-selling book by Bill O'Reilly and _The 80s: The Decade That Made Us_ from Nutopia, which looks at the   years that gave us Starbucks, bottled water and Oprah, among many other staples   of modern society.

I don't know if these two fictional characters would be good together — based on their weeklong journey that's probably a no. But I do know I want to watch them together. Gleeson and Wever portrayed that once-in-a-lifetime energy so, so well. I don't know if I have the guts or would've made all the same decisions Ruby did along the way and so it was thrilling to see her go through with so many of her choices, say fuck it to the things that weren't leaving her feeling fulfilled or excited, and living a life far more adventurous than the one she previously found herself in. Well, right up until that moment of truth. Then it was hard not to wonder, what was all this for then? Was it not for the encouragement that sometimes it is totally worth it to take a risk to escape something boring in exchange for something nearly magical, albeit irresponsible as all hell? And even though Ruby stood up to her husband, clarifying that she's not a baby, just as this show always does, I was still left wanting more.

Knee off the second rope by Reed, but II kicks out at one. II fights back with a knee and knocks Reed silly with it. II capitalizes with punches and another knee, because damn it, the knee works for him. Running knee locks to finish, but Reed takes a step backward and II crashes into the corner. Flying tackle by Reed looks to finish, and it would have, but they're so close to the ropes that II is able to get a foot on the ropes before three. he's still in a weakened state, but Reed goes for the mask, which triggers the shit out of II and suddenly he's Popeye. They collide on a shoulderblock and fall out of different sides of the ring in a surprisingly convincing visual. II crawls back in, but Reed climbs to the top instead and connects with a tackle from up there, and that's a DQ in Mid-South, so II gets the win, but Reed has made his point. GREAT match, telling a clear story the whole way.

The Telangana government responded on a positive note about resuming the shoots of Telugu films that came to a halt due to coronavirus pandemic. Though the exact dates are yet to be announced, several filmmakers are back to work and they started planning the schedules. As it is impossible to shoot in public places and natural locations for the time being, most of them are in plans to erect sets for the shoots or shoot in indoor floors. It is heard that the team of RRR is spending close to Rs 5 crores to erect the set of Pune in Aluminium Factory.
 Prabhas' upcoming project has to be shot in a number of sets as it is impossible to fly to Europe. Several other films will be shot in studios that are in and around Hyderabad. The film studios are already in huge demand for the coming months and they would be booked till the end of this year. Tollywood producers are in plans to grant permission for the shoots of those films that are currently in the final stages of shoot. The next bunch would be granted permission after the completion of these films.
 The theatres are expected to reopen from August and several filmmakers are in plans to release their films starting from Dasara.

Public advocacy groups and wireless competitors with concerns about Verizon's purchase of cable spectrum from SpectrumCo and Cox have asked the FCC to stop the clock on its review of the merger until Verizon submits unredacted versions of its cross marketing agreements with cable.      In a letter to the FCC Tuesday, Media Access Project and Public Knowledge teamed with DirecTV, Sprint, T-Mobile and others to make that request.      Verizon and cable operators have argued that the deals, which have been submitted to the FCC in redacted form, are separate and not at issue in the request for the FCC to grant the transfer of the spectrum licenses. The signatories to the letter, which have been arguing for inclusion of those agreements, aren't so sure, and in any event say the FCC can't determine their impact through redacted documents they say "make it impossible to understand the full ramifications of the documents or to evaluate their relationship to and effect upon the proposed transactions."
 If the FCC reviews the unredacted documents and conclude they are not relevant, as Verizon and cable operators contend, everybody can concentrate on other issues, they say.
 But the groups have been arguing that the documents are central and represent a potential cartel arrangement with cable operators and the telco divvying up the wireless and video marketplace via the agreements that "provide the parties to those agreements with the ability to act as agents selling one another's services."
 They want the FCC to stop its unofficial 180-day shot clock and toll the deadlines for comment until unredacted contracts are entered into the record for review. The FCC has stopped the clock in various merger reviews for various reasons, including in the AT&T–T-Mobile review last summer.

This is why we block-booked rooms for more than 30 people in a local hotel and put others up in bed and breakfast accommodation to ensure no one had to sleep rough on the streets of Ipswich during this crisis. But we know we must look forward. Our hotel block booking will end next month, and we cannot just throw people back out on to the streets. We are developing plans to ensure everyone housed there has somewhere appropriate to move to and that they receive the help and support they need - so that no one has to return to rough sleeping. Finding accommodation for homeless people is one thing but many have little or nothing in the way of possessions to enable them to successfully restart their lives in a new home. I want to - again - thank Direct Line Group for their generous donation of £100,000 to fund starter packs for families and individuals moving into our temporary accommodation facilities. We have already started buying a range of goods - bedding, toys, electrical items, kitchen utensils - things most of us take for granted. I would also like to thank local ceramics cafe Pennikity Pots who have helped entertain homeless families by supplying a range of craft items for them to decorate. If there is one good thing to come out of this crisis it is that we have given many homeless people a genuine chance to make a new start. We must, as a country, ensure that we do not squander this opportunity and allow the levels of rough sleeping we saw before the virus to return. That means ensuring we have enough temporary accommodation and that there is good personal support for homeless people but, crucially, that we greatly expand the amount of genuinely affordable housing available too.

In the context of anthropological drug research, we find the analysis of digital data to hold promise for the field of harm reduction. Future research in this direction could have ethnographers, data analysts, and medical practitioners working together to map the effects of psychoactive substances in order to deal more efficiently with overdosing emergencies and to monitor risky drug use behavior. For anthropology at large, we see many opportunities in working with digital media. These media capture data in the moment and entangle individual needs, social practices, cultural norms, political agendas, and commercial interests. Working with digital tools demands a certain degree of creativity and methodological openness from the researcher. Such tools also enable anthropologists to participate in the re-appropriation and sharing of digital content and to contribute their analyses to researched communities.[note 17] In no way do we think that digital data and digital methods are capable of, or are at all likely to, replace ethnographic fieldwork. There is no shortcut or substitute for gaining the deep, ethnographic understanding of society through human interaction. But digital data are available and digital media are used by people every day. There is no reason why anthropologists should not follow suit.

CHICKASHA, Okla. (TNN) - A Chickasha man is facing multiple charges after crashing his truck, killing one of the passengers inside.Chickasha Police officers, Chickasha Fire/EMS, and Grady County deputies were called to a single-vehicle accident in the 2600 block of W. Grand Ave. on reports that the occupants had been ejected and at least one person was pinned in the pickup truck.Authorities said the pickup, owned and driven by Bradley Teakell, was westbound on W. Grand Ave. at an extremely high rate of speed when it vaulted a set of railroad tracks, causing Teakell to lose control and depart the road on the left side. The pickup struck a lamp post and rolled several times before coming to a rest in an embankment. All three people were ejected from the pickup when it rolled.30-year-old Jordan Jacobs of Ninnekah was pinned underneath and was pronounced dead at the scene.The other passenger, Mary Martin, was transported to Oklahoma City in serious condition and is expected to recover.Teakell was transported to Grady Memorial ER to have his blood drawn and to be seen for his injuries. He was cleared for confinement and was then taken to the Grady County Law Enforcement Center and booked on charges of manslaughter in the 1st degree, driving under the influence and reckless driving.Copyright 2020 Texoma News Network.

In their study of the Twitter hashtag ‘#Ferguson’ and the protests around the police killing of the unarmed African American teenager Michael Brown, Bonilla and Rosa (2015) treat Twitter hashtags as a field site. While their work leads to an insightful ethnography, it could have benefitted from taking advantage of the distinct affordances of Twitter, which allows for live monitoring of a hashtag. When downloaded, these tweets form a comprehensive sample of everything that was tweeted under a certain hashtag during a certain period. The dynamics of events could then be retraced and analyzed afterwards. Skype interviews, online surveys, participant observation of discussion boards, and informant recruiting through Facebook are other common examples of what Rogers would term the digitization or translation of ethnographic methods (see for example Garcia et al. 2009; Murthy 2008; Reich 2014).

 A US court in 2018 found Big Fish Casino's virtual casino chips constituted gambling, and allowed the civil lawsuit to continue.
 The first of the legal actions was filed against US company Churchill Downs, which owned the games business prior to selling it to Aristocrat in 2018.
 Churchill Downs will pay the remainder of the settlement costs.
 The costs cover money lost on the games and legal fees.
 By 1405 AEST, Aristocrat shares were trading higher by 1.14 per cent at $25.81.
 Last week, the company reported half-year profit had fallen 14.2 per cent to $305.9 million as casinos, pubs and clubs closed because of coronavirus restrictions.

This Welsh sheep farm may look beautiful but it's under threat. Not just from the impact of Brexit, but now also from coronavirus. Sheep farming is big business in Wales, which has a flock of 9.5m. Sheep here outnumber people three to one. But coronavirus shut down the service sector overnight. A third of the lamb market gone.
 So what can sheep tell us about trade, Brexit, and British farming? Is there a risk that the UK farming industry as we know it won't survive in its current form?
 I think it's really, really important that we take these challenges one at a time. You know, we absolutely must deal with the coronavirus. That's our first priority now. That's got a massive impact on all agricultural markets at the present time.
 Next, we need to make sure that we get a deal with the EU. So we need to work from that and ensure that is right. And then obviously, we have the agricultural bill. That will set the standards and the way we trade.
 Some farmers, like Garry, we're worried about leaving the European Union long before the coronavirus hit. The domestic market is split between the service sector and retail. But the remaining third of all the UK lamb is exported. And, until now, more than 90 per cent of exports have gone to the EU.
 So what's the issue? Well, when it comes to trade getting on with your neighbours is very important. Countries that trade a lot with each other can form a customs union like the EU, which doesn't impose tariffs on members but does impose tariffs on non-members. And when trade ties are tight breaking up is hard to do. Which is why Brexit is hard to do.
 The UK needs to work out how to move from being inside the tariff-free EU customs union to being outside that union. And it needs to negotiate which tariffs are likely to apply. It also needs to find the time to negotiate all this in the middle of a pandemic without face-to-face meetings.
 EU tariffs on agricultural products are already higher than average. That means UK sheep are at particular risk. We visited Garry's farm in the Brecon Beacons before the outbreak.
 Garry, can you tell me which way you voted in the Brexit vote?
 Yes, I voted Remain, actually. Important part of our income is the support for food production and environmental management, which was paid directly from the EU. We need a trade deal. And we need, we need a trade deal to be completed effectively. It is absolutely vital for farming within Wales and, indeed, the UK.
 So Garry, tell me, this sheep right now, how much would you get for it if you sent it to the EU?
 Oh, this lamb is worth about £80.
 £80?
 £80 at present, yeah.
 Unless the UK signs a preferential trade deal with the EU, its exports could be hit with the standard tariffs the EU charges all members of the World Trade Organisation.
 For lamb, that ranges from 40 per cent to 80 per cent. 40 per cent of £80 is £32, which would bring the price of the sheep up to £112. Passing that extra cost onto the consumer would hit demand. But if farmers were forced to pay they could end up operating at a loss.
 I mean, would you actually go out of business if that happened?
 Well, I mean, we'd be in serious trouble. Yeah, you know, we'd be in very serious trouble. We'd be... and, you know, you may be able to cope with it for six, nine, 12 months, but not moving forward, you know, not over any sort of sustainable time period.
 Before coronavirus the National Farmers Union warned that a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for British farming. UK politicians are insisting they will not extend the current transition period beyond the end of the year. That means leaving without a deal is still a real risk.
 You can only take so many hits at a time. So let's take a sensible, pragmatic view to this year. Great - if we can get a deal like it's been promised and with no tariffs and a good trading relationship, that's absolutely great. But let's be realistic on what can be achieved here.
 I don't know... you know, there's been a lot of really great things to be learned from using the internet for meeting purposes, this, that, and the other. But when it really comes down to the nuts and bolts of it, when we really getting to those final stages, I think you need to be sat across the table looking eye-to-eye and picking up all of the body language, and understanding all of those messages coming across.
 The lack of a trade deal with the EU could result in a serious blow to the export of UK animal products. The UK government could cut tariffs to stop a rise in food prices, actually increasing imports from overseas. And trade barriers between the UK and the EU could make it harder for farmers to get medicines, fertilisers, or immigrant labour.
 Of course, it's not just agriculture. The EU is the UK's largest trading partner. In 2018, UK exports to the EU were $291bn. That's 45 per cent of all UK exports. UK imports from the EU were $357bn, or 53 per cent of all UK imports. If these exports and imports get hit with tariffs that could be difficult for various industries, not just farming.
 If farmers don't get a good deal in these trade negotiations with the EU, how would it affect the local communities here?
 You know, we are the backbone of the communities. And, as the farmer, if the farmer numbers decrease, then, you know, where does this leave the local schools, the local businesses that are reliant on the farming custom?
 Are we just going to be a retirement haven for, you know, people have enough money to move here and live here, bearing in mind that a lot of these farms are... some of them are fourth, fifth generation. You know, their families have been living here for hundreds of years. The Welsh language is based around the farming communities. Our culture... it's not only business, you know?
 Through Brexit, Britain voted to go it alone. Some saw clouds overhead, others saw a light shining through. But few predicted a global pandemic could also be on the horizon. Now farmers must struggle with this new challenge.
 The political and economic landscape has changed. New trade deals will change the landscape once more.

Such baseless and knee-jerk allegations of lawbreaking would be bad coming from anyone in a position of authority, but out of the mouth of the most powerful person on the planet, who is in charge of all the nation’s military and law enforcement might, it is more awful than I have words to express. As with so many other things with Trump, if a line prosecutor at DOJ or a staff writer for a national newspaper engaged in this kind of unfounded criminal accusation, they would be fired.
