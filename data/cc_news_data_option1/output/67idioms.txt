Little’s overall proposed general fund increase of 3.75 percent is the smallest since the 2014 fiscal year, said Division of Financial Management Administrator Alex Adams. It would make permanent spending cuts Little demanded from every agency except schools late last year, leave a $61 million balance at the end of the 2021 fiscal year as a cushion in case of a recession and boost the state’s rainy day funds by $102 million.
 “My budget leaves an appropriate cash balance and shores up our rainy day funds, which have helped us weather economic storms that forced other states to raise taxes,” Little said.
 Eastern Idaho-specific items include $6 million to build career technical education facilities in several places, including at the College of Eastern Idaho, and $1.3 million to create 25 new medical residencies in eastern Idaho. Little wants to spend $1 million on a new cybersecurity degree program at Boise State University, Idaho State University and the University of Idaho that would partner with employers such as Idaho National Laboratory. And Little talked up an addendum to the 1995 Settlement Agreement between the state and the U.S. Department of Energy that has set some new cleanup deadlines and created a path to bring small amounts of spent nuclear fuel to INL for research.
 “Our updated agreement is a remarkable milestone,” he said. “It reinforces the 1995 agreement by incentivizing the federal government to carry out remaining cleanup obligations. Our updated agreement also paves the way for more groundbreaking research at the INL.”
 Little’s proposal to cover the state’s $41 million in matching funds for the first full year of Medicaid expansion would repurpose $8.5 million that counties could save on indigent health care spending, with the state making up the rest through a mix of savings elsewhere and Millennium Fund money. It does not outline how that $8.5 million would be apportioned among counties.
 “There’s going to be a policy discussion,” Adams said.
 House Speaker Scott Bedke, R-Oakley, said he likes that it wouldn’t require new general fund spending, which he said would have been a non-starter for House Republicans. Rep. Chris Abernathy, D-Pocatello, said the state should pay for it all.
 “Funding Medicaid expansion at the state level helps to protect public services offered at the city and county levels while also protecting against an uninsured gap population,” he said.
 Little is proposing taking at least $35 million in revenue the state has taken in from internet sales tax collections and apply it toward reducing the sales tax on groceries, although the details must be worked out.
 Senate President Pro Tempore Brent Hill, R-Rexburg, praised Little’s focus on education.
 “I think he’s putting his emphasis on the most important things,” Hill said.
 Rep. Gary Marshall, R-Idaho Falls, said he backs raising teacher pay, although he isn’t yet sure what the best approach would be. Bedke said he might prefer an approach to raising teacher pay that gives school districts more flexibility in how to spend the money. But, he praised Little’s early childhood literacy focus.
 “I think no one can criticize the need for increased investment and increased emphasis put on the literacy programs in the state of Idaho,” Bedke said.
 Completely repealing both the grocery sales tax and the grocery tax credit would cost the state about $113 million, Bedke said, or far less than the $35 million Little has earmarked for it. Possibilities include raising the credit, removing it from certain types of food, reducing the rate or starting a phased-in elimination of the tax, Hill said. However, not all lawmakers are on board.
 “I don’t think we have enough money right now to scrap grocery tax personally,” Marshall said. “In some ways, grocery tax is a fair tax,” noting that everyone contributes.

Rapinoe's efforts to use sports as a platform to discuss bigger issues was hardly a one-off in 2019. Of the top 12 stories in the balloting, only three — titles won by the Toronto Raptors, Washington Nationals and University of Virginia basketball team — stuck mainly to what happened between the lines.
 All the rest — including the blown call that cost the Saints a chance at the Super Bowl, a California law that threatens to upend the NCAA and Simone Biles' dominance at gymnastics' world championships, set against the backdrop of the sex-abuse crisis consuming the sport in the U.S. — were long-running sagas that went beyond a single day or event. They painted sports not as an escape from the world's problems but merely another window into them.
 It's no stretch to say that the whole of the Woods saga — namely, the sordid, pain-riddled, decade-long prelude to his victory at Augusta National in April — would fit into that category, as well.
 His downfall began in the wee hours the day after Thanksgiving in 2009, when he ran over a fire hydrant outside his house in Florida, triggering an avalanche of stories about infidelity that would lead to the breakup of his marriage and play into the near-destruction of his career.
 Part 2 was the injuries. Woods came close but did not return to his dominant form after his return to golf following his breakup with his wife. And as time went on, his physical condition deteriorated. He didn't play in 2016 or 2017, and at the end of '17, he conceded his back was so bad that his days of competitive golf might be behind him.
 There were four risky back surgeries. Woods also required a good deal of inner healing after a mortifying DUI arrest in 2017 that exposed his reliance on painkillers.
 Through it all, Woods somehow kept nurturing his love for golf. And eventually, he found his game again. He climbed his way back to the top. He had close calls at two majors in 2018 — the British Open and PGA Championship — and then won the season-ending Tour Championship, as good a sign as any that, at 43, he could take on the best and win.
 But regular tournaments are not the majors, and no major is the Masters.
 It was on those hallowed grounds at Augusta National where Woods set the marker, starting a decade of dominance that would redefine the game. He blew away the field by 12 strokes in 1997 to win the first of what has become five green jackets and 15 major titles.

Here's a shocking truth. Over the past decade, 23,000 sewage spills have occurred in Florida. As a result, 1.6 billion gallons of wastewater have been released to the environment (either into waterways or onto land) due the failure of aging sewer pipes, lift stations and wastewater treatment plants.
   
 More than 370 million gallons of that number were completely untreated. It's just one of Florida's obvious environmental problems demanding attention.
   
 Just ask the residents of Fort Lauderdale. During the 16 days prior to Christmas, three major sewer pipe failures poured an un-calculated amount of raw sewage, probably millions of gallons, into streets and water bodies. An emergency bypass stopped the leakage into the Rio Vista River, but arresting the sewage leaking into the Himmarshee Canal took longer.
   
 Even when aging sewer systems do not catastrophically fail, they still leak or exfiltrate. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates 10-17% of raw sewage leaks directly into the environment and groundwater from aging sewer pipes.
   
 In Florida, 1.5 billion gallons of wastewater are treated EVERY DAY. That's 534 billion gallons of wastewater each year. Just 10% of that results in 53.4 billion gallons of raw sewage annually entering the environment and groundwater.
   
 And, that isn't all. Aging sewer pipes infiltrate. When rains are heavy, stormwater infiltrates and overloads sewer pipes, overwhelming lift stations and treatment plant capacities.
   
 Municipal plants have no choice but to dump untreated or partially treated sewage into the environment or risk catastrophic damage to the facility. Infiltration is responsible for spewing additional tens of millions of gallons of sewage onto the ground and into streets and waterways.
   
 Failures, exfiltration and infiltration all demand attention as hazardous to health and the environment. Our ground and surface waters are being polluted right before us. And, it doesn't require a "Blue-Green Algae" Task Force to recognize that age and neglect are polluting our water and environment.
   
 The Coalition for Property Rights look for solutions and recently visited the city of Brooksville, which is renovating its sewer pipe system. Using processes such as smoke detection to identify leaks, video observation to prioritize the worst leaks, and a process called Cured-In-Place-Pipe, their pipes and manholes are being re-lined from within.
   
 It prevents exfiltration and infiltration, not to mention preventing failure. This rehabilitation project also eases the stress on the wastewater treatment plant during heavy rain events. Estimated cost of the project: $8,545,841.
   
 The Florida Keys has taken dramatic action. After a disastrous experimentation with so-called "advanced" or nitrogen-reducing septic systems, Monroe County has been upgrading their wastewater treatment plants to Advance Wastewater Treatment plants (AWTs).
   
 These AWTs remove bacteria and 97 percent or more of nutrients. Treated effluent is then put into injection wells 3,200 feet below the surface. Estimated capital cost to connect residents and businesses to AWTs is $1 billion.
   
 Two-thirds of Florida residences and businesses are serviced by sewer systems. Additionally, more than 100 million visitors use our sewer systems each year. And, in light of a projected 6 million new residents coming to Florida over the next few years, rehabilitation and capacity upgrades of our sewer systems cry out for action.
   
 Florida has spent billions on Everglades restoration. Additional millions are spent on the acquisition of conservation lands. But if wastewater never makes it to a treatment plant due to failing pipes, and if treatment plants put nutrient-rich effluent right back into our waters and environment, or the plants lack capacity during rain events and power outages, what difference will it make?
   
 Florida needs to fix this growing problem looming right in front of our noses. And the residents of Fort Lauderdale are reminded of it with every breath they take.

“It is time for Minister Harris to come clean on when the recruitment ban will be suspended.”
 The INMO is calling for a major incident protocol to be adopted across the country.
 This is likely to see all non-emergency admissions halted, elective surgery cancelled and extra bed capacity sourced from the private and public sectors.
 The General Secretary of the INMO, Phil Ni Sheaghdha claimed hospitals in Cork had a number of nurses on panels in October but were not sanctioned to put them on payroll until the end of last month.
 She said: “We are very critical of the preplanning, we’re very critical of the deliberate slowdown in recruitment that has been imposed by the HSE nationally.
 “It’s deliberate, it’s a policy and it has to go. We were before the Oireachtas Committee on health twice this year, we flagged this up.
 “The excuse that this is all down to the flu simply doesn’t hold.
 “Behind these numbers are hundreds of individual vulnerable patients – it is simply shameful situation.”
 The HSE’s national director of acute hospitals Liam Woods admitted there is a shortage of hospital beds and gaps in community care.
 He acknowledged “this is not a good day” for the health system but told RTE news that capacity will improve with 190 beds due to open in the first quarter of this year.
 He said 40 will open in a new unit in Clonmel in the next four weeks, with further ones due to be made available in Drogheda and Waterford.

On that day, Woods came off the 18th green and wrapped himself in a warm embrace with his father, Earl, whose death in 2006 left an undeniable void in the player's life.
 Though there had been a handful of close calls between his U.S. Open victory in 2008 and the start of 2019, it was clear that if there was a single course where Woods could conjure the old magic and end a major drought, it would be Augusta National. As a four-time champion, Woods built a career on studying every inch of the layout, knowing every fault line and every sneaky twist and turn of the slickest greens on earth.
 But where, at one time, he might have overpowered the course and intimidated the competition, in 2019, he simply outlasted them both. He avoided mistakes while everyone else was making them. Instead of taking a lead into the last day, then never giving anyone a whiff of hope, this was a comeback. He started the day two shots behind.
 As AP Golf Writer Doug Ferguson wrote in his wrapup of the final day: "Woods never missed a shot that mattered over the final seven holes, taking the lead with a 5-iron to the fat of the green on the par-5 15th for a two-putt birdie, delivering the knockout with an 8-iron that rode down the ridge by the cup and settled 2 feet away for birdie on the par-3 16th."
 When it was over, Woods came to the same spot where he'd met Earl 22 years before. He scooped up his son, Charlie, and held him in a long embrace, then did the same with his 11-year-old daughter, Sam, and mother, Tilda.
 "For them to see what it's like to have their dad win a major championship, I hope that's something they will never forget," Woods said.
 Very few golf fans will. And in a sports year dominated by weightier topics, Woods at the Masters stood out — a comeback story that left people smiling at the end.

The top three spots remained unchanged. No. 1 Gonzaga received 54 first-place votes from a 65-member media panel, with No. 2 Duke getting nine and No. 3 Kansas two. Baylor was No. 4.
 Auburn (13-0) climbed three spots to No. 5, its highest ranking since reaching No. 2 in 1999-00. San Diego State (15-0) moved up six places to No. 7, the Aztecs’ highest ranking since hitting No. 5 six years ago.
 The Tigers have a new cast of characters this season after a surprising Final Four run a year ago. Even without Bryce Brown, Jared Harper and Chuma Okeke, Auburn has continued to find ways to win.
 The Tigers blew through their nonconference schedule before opening SEC play at Humphrey Coliseum, where they’ve struggled since 2001. Auburn pulled away in the second half of the 80-68 victory and was led by J’Von McCormick, a bit player on last year’s team who scored 28 points.
 “I think we’re a good team. I don’t think we’re a very good team yet and it’s not criticism,” Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said last week. “It’s just that I know how much we’ve got to do offensively, defensively to get there. We’re improving. We’ve got a long way to go.”
 San Diego State is off to its best start since the Kawhi Leonard-led team in 2010-11 won its first 20 games. The Aztecs have been stingy defensively in their third season under Brian Dutcher, allowing teams to score 70 points just twice this season.
 San Diego State went to Logan, Utah, on Saturday and ended Utah State’s 15-game home winning streak with a 77-68 victory. The Aztecs are No. 1 in the NCAA’s NET rankings based on the nation’s best adjusted efficiency margin and a top-50 strength of schedule.
 “They’re really, really good,” Utah State coach Craig Smith said.
 STABILITY ON TOP
 Gonzaga became the first team to remain atop the poll for three straight weeks in a season of parity.
 The Bulldogs didn’t make it easy on themselves, having to rally in the second half to beat Portland and Pepperdine last week.
 Even so, Gonzaga leads the nation with 88.3 points per game, is winning at a clip of nearly 20 points per game and has six players averaging double figures.
 Duke remained at No. 2 after rolling over Boston College and Miami last week. Kansas held at No. 3 following a hard-fought 60-53 win over then-No. 16 West Virginia.
 BULLDOGS ON THE RISE
 Butler has bounced back from a disappointing 2018-19 season by grinding opponents down defensively.
 The Bulldogs (14-1) are fourth in Ken Pomeroy’s adjusted defensive efficiency and are fourth in Division I scoring defense, allowing 54.1 points per game.
 Butler moved up five spots in this week’s poll to No. 11, the program’s highest ranking ever, after shutting down high-scoring Creighton.

 Lotz started with Farm and Home in September of 2018 when she came on board as an MIT (manager in training), and, just a year later, volunteered to come to Keokuk to help out with the remodel of this store. “In Springfield, I had been an assistant manager in charge of farm equipment, tools and power equipment, seed and herbicides – all of that sort of thing,” she said. “I guess they saw my passion for all that Farm and Home sells and what kind of a store it is, and they offered me this manager position.” She accepted their offer and took over the Keokuk store in September of 2019.
 “Farm and Home is founded in the community and we do whatever we can to give back to the community,” she explained. “This happens to be Farm and Home’s 60th anniversary year and, as part of the celebration, we will make a point of donating to local nonprofits and organizations in the community. I want to show the customers and the community that I am all about them, and that customer service is our number one priority, as is serving and being a part of the community.”
