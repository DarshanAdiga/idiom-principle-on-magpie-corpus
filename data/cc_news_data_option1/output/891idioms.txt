In a previous letter I anticipated a francophone challenge to Bill 40 and argued for a collaboration between the linguistic communities in contesting the law.
 Unlike the anglophone challenge now before the courts, the contestation in the offing of a francophone citizens‚Äô coalition can‚Äôt rely on the minority- language protection of the constitution, which is ‚Äúnotwithstanding clause- proof‚Äù. And possibly its announced legal arguments could be preempted had the government included in Bill 40 the notwithstanding clauses found in the constitution and the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. But the government believed it had the support of the silent francophone majority for the abolition of school boards, so it didn‚Äôt think the notwithstanding clause, a generally unpopular use of political power, was necessary or useful.
 The law could yet be amended to include the clause and stave off the looming challenge, but the government would be weakened politically at the expense of being strengthened legally. One of the arguments of the coalition is that Bill 40 discriminates against francophones because, unlike anglophones, they can‚Äôt elect school officials under the reform. Were the government to use the notwithstanding clause against francophones, it would be doubly discriminatory, first, taking away their democratic rights, and second, taking away their right to challenge this in court. The political cost in 2022 could dramatically exceed any legal benefit between now and then.

The frequent crackdowns on errant health professionals and quacks just go to show how a vital services sector, the selling of drugs and other medical supplies, has been infiltrated by greedy people, putting patients at grave risk. In almost every region, hundreds of outlets have been shut down and attendants or owners arrested, but new ones emerge and some of those on which there were question marks are clandestinely cleared.
 These merchants of death are motivated by the easy money to be made in this potentially lucrative business. In the slums of Nairobi and other towns and even rural areas, many of these illicit businesses exist. At trading centres, the rush to shut doors on being tipped off about an impending swoop is a common.
 Besides the possibility of buying substandard or expired drugs, some of the pharmacists masquerade as clinical officers or doctors, selling prescription drugs over the counter. The consequences of this recklessness have often been devastating for the patients. Statistics indicate that one in every 10 Kenyans would rather consult a pharmacist than go to hospital. They take medicines for wrongly diagnosed illnesses, endangering themselves.
 This is a huge challenge for the Pharmacy and Poisons Board, which is the regulator of a subsector where, out of the nearly 15,000 outlets operating across the country, only about 6,000 are registered. It is a pity that crooks prey on people who desperately need the right medicines to save their lives.
 While we hope that the authorities will continue to identify and crack down on the con men and women, there is an urgent need to step up public education and awareness on the grave danger that lurks out there as regards illicit ‚Äòchemists‚Äô.

The EUR/USD pair gave up some ground on Wednesday, as investors decided to take a breather after pushing the EUR/USD to its highest level in nearly three months at 1.1213 on the back of Federal Reserve's decision to cut rates by 50 bps. The Fed's move - aimed at counteracting coronavirus negative effects - weighed on the dollar and drove Treasury yields to historic lows, although they both regained some traction on Wednesday. The Fed followed the Reserve Bank of Australia and was followed by the Bank of Canada in cutting rates. While other major central banks have pledged to act if necessary, markets are pricing a 10 bps cut by the European Central Bank at April's meeting.

In January, six the top-10 gainers at the bourse were firms with a market capitalisation of less than Sh5 billion each.
 The small-cap counters at the NSE that were on the top-gainers list did so exclusively on the back of local investor trading, with foreign participation at zero percent.
 This may have offered them protection from the negative effects of the foreign selling that characterised the market last month, and which was a major reason for the price slide in large cap counters.
 Foreign investors sold a net of Sh2.7 billion last month, reversing the net inflows of Sh540 million recorded in January.
 The foreign investors, who mainly trade on blue chip stocks, accounted for 62.8 percent of traded turnover that stood at Sh12.4 billion at the NSE last month.
 Their selling activity therefore saw 19 of the 20 constituent stocks of the NSE 20 share index (with StanChart the only exception) record a price decline pulling the index down by 10 percent during the month.
 Foreigners prefer large caps due to high liquidity.

The brewery broke out in a standing ovation and raucous applause at an election night watch party in East Austin Tuesday evening after early statewide vote returns showed Bernie Sanders with a solid lead over Joe Biden.


  Amid the excitement, a Sanders campaign organizer encouraged attendees to fill their cups with beer and other libations and stock up on a menu that included pizza and burgers.


  ‚ÄúIn Travis County, Austin, we just delivered for Bernie Sanders really freakin‚Äô big,‚Äù Austin City Council Member Greg Casar, who publicly endorsed Sanders in January, told an already brimming crowd. ‚ÄúThe moment is upon us.‚Äù


  But that moment quickly faded.


  It ended up being a tough night for Sanders‚Äô loyalists and the candidate himself, who was unable to overcome an organized push by Biden and the party‚Äôs more centrist faction to slow the Vermont senator‚Äôs early-state momentum.


  Though the early voting results offered promise to the self-proclaimed democratic socialist, the one-time front-runner for the nomination, election day returns dealt a fatal blow in the state. Biden received about 34% of the Texas vote, compared to Sanders‚Äô 30%, according to the Texas Secretary of State.


  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pissed off,‚Äù Marlon Saucedo, a 25-year-old documentarian, said as final results showed a neck-and-neck race between the two white-haired septuagenarians. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of push against Sanders and it makes me feel very helpless. There‚Äôs always going to be a faction of the party trying to stop him.‚Äù


  Alan Zaizar, 30, who wore a ‚ÄúUnidos Con Bernie‚Äù pin, said he won‚Äôt vote for Biden if he ends up being the party‚Äôs nominee.


  ‚ÄúI would write in Bernie‚Äôs name,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe DNC robbed the election from Bernie in 2016 and I‚Äôm tired of the status quo.‚Äù


  Biden‚Äôs win was a striking comeback, coming after members of the party establishment coalesced behind the former vice president. During a rally in Dallas on Monday, Beto O‚ÄôRourke endorsed Biden. Former rivals Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar did the same. Biden's win in Texas was, in part, powered by the support of older, moderate voters, key constituencies for Democrats and ones that polls show are overwhelmingly supportive of his candidacy.


  But Texas Democrats this year have publicly acknowledged they need to expand their support if they want victories up and down the ballot. The party is trying to replicate Beto O‚ÄôRourke-esque level excitement in November, but the El Pasoan‚Äôs near-success against U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 was driven, in part, by an organic effort from energized, young voters who turned out to the polls. Support and excitement among that same bloc is one of the biggest question marks surrounding Biden‚Äôs run; if young voters are not excited by him, it could make it difficult for Democrats to be successful this fall.

In the global market, Asia pacific is anticipated to dominate the market and is expected to maintain its dominance throughout the forecast period. This can be attributed to the rapid growth of the construction sector in the region. Moreover, rising urbanization will lead to the establishment of various industries. This, in turn, is expected to create healthy demand for insulation boards in the Asia Pacific. China and India are the key countries contributing majorly to the overall growth of the region as a huge number of market players involved in the manufacturing of insulation boards are located in these two countries. Moreover, growing construction industry and rapid industrialization across the globe will uplift the overall demand for insulation boards during the projected time period.

However, if the stock price goes below the $53.83 mark, then the market for Calavo Growers, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $51.75 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -12.82. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

The Champaign developer who converted an empty Monticello bank building into a multi-use venue may now take on a 2-acre, blank slate of land just east of the downtown district known as Pepsin Hill.
 Monticello‚Äôs city council on Feb. 24 approved a temporary license agreement with Spencer Atkins, giving him a 60-day exclusive right to develop potential plans for the property, which was cleaned up by the city in 2005 after the former Pepsin Syrup factory was razed.
 Details are not being released, but the request for proposal (RFP) put out several months ago called for developers to pitch plans that would develop the site ‚Äúinto a commercial or mixed-use development that would significantly complement the area as an extension of the downtown.‚Äù
 City Director of Community Development Callie Jo McFarland said Atkins ‚Äì who grew up in Monticello ‚Äì proved his mettle when he took the former 1920‚Äôs-era First Mid-Illinois Bank building and renovated it to house a Christie Clinic, a second floor event space, four B&B-style rooms, and other commercial spaces.
 He also dug into the history books and renamed the structure the ‚ÄúMoore Building,‚Äù after its builder Allen F. Moore.
 ‚ÄúWe were blown away by the attention to detail and vision he had for the Moore Building,‚Äù said McFarland. ‚ÄúHe could have just gone turnkey and cleaned it up a little bit, but then it wouldn‚Äôt be used like it is being used now.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve received a proposal staff is excited about,‚Äù she told the
 council.
 The RFP asks for a developer to create a mixed-use development, integrate it into pedestrian and bicycle paths, provide a facility that will invest in the downtown business district through jobs and tax revenue, and incorporate aesthetic elements such as green space and public art.
 During the 60-day window approved by the city council, the city will negotiate exclusively with Atkins. If plans proceed, the issue would likely go to the zoning board of appeals for land use changes that are needed, then to the council for approval. City aldermen would also need to approve a purchase and sales agreement, as well as a redevelopment agreement since the land is in a Tax Increment Financing District.
 McFarland and City Administrator Terry Summers have both worked for the town since the Pepsin property came under the city‚Äôs auspices. Summers said they have not worked continually on redevelopment, but that it has always been on their minds.

 The Pepsin Syrup plant closed in 1985. The city then used $257,000 in grants and a $425,000 Illinois Environmental Protection Agency loan to clean and clear the site.
 Atkins is considering an area that encompasses the 1.56-acre tract between Washington and Livingston Streets (416 W. Washington St.) and a .63-acre one between Livingston Street and the railroad tracks (203 N. Park St.). An optional third tract (Tract 8) is also being offered, a 2,340-square-foot one that is in the final stages of being cleaned up by the city.
 The city council also on Feb. 24 approved preliminary engineering services for a possible realignment of North Park Street to Railroad Street, something that could take place during redevelopment of Pepsin Hill. City officials have talked in the past about ways to make that turn safer, particularly since it is so close to the municipal swimming pool.
 A change order for the cleanup of Tract 8 was also approved, since it may exceed its $180,000 in reimbursable costs from former owner Pfizer by about $11,000.

Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJIA, climbed 1,171 points, or 4.5%, to end around 27,090. The S&P 500 added 4.2% and the NASDAQadded 3.9%. US Benchmarks ended on Wednesday a great deal higher following what appears to be a centralised effort by bankers toaddress the outbreak of COVID-19 on an economic standpoint. We have seen the Reserve Bank of Australia, Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada as the latest central bank to join the rate- cutting syndicate and US lawmakers putting together a huge package of funding to battle the crisis. At the same time, former Vice President Joe Biden won in Super Tuesday election contests which have started to clear the way for theDemocratic nominee to go head to head with the incumbent President Donald Trump. Consequently, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJIA, climbed 1,171 points, or 4.5%, to end around 27,090, pulling back all of the800 points lost in the priorsession.

NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî For his debut novel, Dave Matthews found inspiration close to home. He was recording music in New Orleans years ago when he started imaging the story of ‚ÄúIf We Were Giants.‚Äù His twin daughters were 6. While they played in the trees, the singer-songwriter was overwhelmed by nature and how people interact with it. So that prompted him to craft a story to share with them. Though the story centers on a strong young woman, Matthews never set out to write a book about female empowerment. He says it just sort of happened. ‚ÄúI think maybe because my daughters inspire me,‚Äù he said. Kirra, the heroine of the story, is a 14-year old girl living in a hidden community inside a volcano. But her family‚Äôs secret location is discovered and destroyed. As the lone survivor, she is taken in by a group of forest dwellers. Over time, she summons the courage to confront her past and save her new family from another deadly attack. Matthews wants the book to provide hope in a complicated world. Published by Disney-Hyperion, ‚ÄúIf We Were Giants‚Äù is currently in bookstores. Matthews has no problem crafting hit albums or playing to massive crowds, yet he wasn‚Äôt sure he could effectively put his ideas into words, so he joined forces with award-winning writer Clete Barrett Smith to write the young adult novel. His daughters are now 18 and Matthews talks with them and his middle school-aged son about current events, like the environment and the war in Syria. ‚ÄúThey do get heartbroken. Because it's their world and they're like, ‚ÄòWhat are we inheriting?‚Äô I want them to realize that even if the door is closing, there is possibility to be kind and strong and intelligent because that's the only option,\" he said.

 Health care companies helped lead the gains after Biden solidified his contender status for the Democratic presidential nomination. Investors see him as a more business-friendly alternative to Bernie Sanders. The S&P 500 jumped 3.9% and the Nasdaq rose 3.3%.
 The gains more than recouped the market's big losses from a day ealier as Wall Street's wild, virus-fueled swings extend into a third week.
 Health care stocks led the market's spurt after a strong performance by Biden in state primaries on Tuesday moved him to top-tier status for the Democratic presidential nomination. Many investors believe he is more friendly to businesses than the other top contender, Bernie Sanders, whose proposals for health care and the economy could hurt profits at insurers and other companies.
 The rally's momentum accelerated around midday after House and Senate leadership reached a deal on a bipartisan $8.3 billion bill to battle the coronavirus outbreak. The House was set to vote on the measure later Wednesday. Senate leaders were pressing for a vote in that chamber by the end of the week. The measure's funds would go toward research into a vaccine, improved tests and drugs to treat infected people.
 ‚ÄúThe fact that you get an $8 billion bill, that's money that will be spent, hopefully, on something that really will have an impact on mitigating the effects on the economy,‚Äù said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager with Globalt Investments.
 Investors are also anticipating other central banks will follow up on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs surprise move Tuesday to slash interest rates by half a percentage point in hopes of protecting the economy from the economic fallout of a fast-spreading virus. Canada's central bank cut rates on Wednesday, also by half a percentage point and citing the virus' effect.
 Some measures of fear in the market eased. Treasury yields rose but were still near record lows in a sign that the bond market remains concerned about the economic pain possible from the fast-spreading virus. Companies around the world are already saying the virus is sapping away earnings due to supply chain disruptions and weaker sales, with General Electric becoming the latest to warn its investors.
 Even though many investors say they know lower interest rates will not halt the spread of the virus, they want to see central banks and other authorities do what they can to lessen the damage. The S&P 500 sank 2.8% on Tuesday after a brief relief rally triggered by the Fed‚Äôs rate cut fizzled.
 ‚ÄúMonetary policy can only take us so far, but at least it‚Äôs a step,‚Äù said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset. "Investors will take comfort in co-ordinated central bank action. I take comfort in knowing this isn‚Äôt the plague, we‚Äôll eventually get through this.‚Äù
 The Bank of England has a meeting on March 26 on interest rates. The European Central Bank and others around the world have already cut rates below zero, meanwhile, which limits their monetary policy firepower. But economists say they could make other moves, such as freeing up banks to lend more.
 An indicator of fear in the market, which measures how much traders are paying to protect themselves from future swings for the S&P 500, eased by nearly 13% in afternoon trading. The price of gold, which tends to rise when investors are feeling fearful, also dipped $1.40 to $1,643 per ounce.

The two measures on the ballot that would have overturned a ban on medical cannabis sales in Kern County both fared poorly in early election returns.
 Measure D received 52,240 no votes and 34,398 yes votes with all precincts reporting Wednesday morning, or 60.3 percent against to 39.7 in favor.
 Measure E received 50,205 no votes and 36,163 yes votes with all precincts reporting, or around 58.13 percent against to around 41.87 percent in favor.
 The two medical marijuana measures presented starkly different strategies for legalizing medical cannabis sales in Kern County.
 Measure D ended up on the ballot after cannabis advocates led a successful signature campaign.
 Medical marijuana dispensaries that were open before Jan. 1 2018 would be allowed to open under Measure D, providing they can provide documentation proving they were a legal business.
 County officials wrote Measure E as an alternative to Measure D. The measure aims to provide a ‚Äúclean slate‚Äù for the medical cannabis marketplace in Kern County. Rather than issue blanket permits for dispensaries open before a certain date, the measure would require dispensaries to apply for a conditional use permit from the county before being allowed to open.
 Through the conditional use permit, Measure E gives county officials and the community some input into the types of dispensaries that would be allowed to open.
 The topic of which dispensaries should be allowed to open under a new medical cannabis system has been hotly debated. Proponents for Measure D have said they do not want the county to be involved in approving dispensaries, afraid the county will pick and choose their preferred choices.
 Meanwhile, some have worried Measure D would create a monopoly of its own by shutting out new dispensaries from opening in Kern County.

Perhaps most of the analysis of U.S. presidential races since 1992 have overthought a basic point: Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were extremely charismatic, that charisma enabled them to unite an instinctively divided party, and without that kind of exceptionally magnetic figure, the Republican Party has a small advantage in presidential politics. Maybe what we‚Äôre seeing in this year‚Äôs demolition derby of a primary ‚Äî and the 2016 fight between Clinton and Sanders ‚Äî is ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù or the default. Maybe 1992, 1996, 2008, and 2012 were the outliers, and the Democratic Party has been in a weaker, more fractured state than almost everyone thought all along.

WORCESTER -- In a rematch of the last two Division 1 Central semifinals between Natick and Wachusett, the two teams went to overtime for the second year in a row - but this time it was the Redhawks that came out on top.
 Natick senior Brenna McDonald scored 32 points as she led the third-seeded Redhawks to a 64-54 overtime victory over the previously unbeaten No. 2 seed Mountaineers to advance to the Division 1 Central final for the first time since 2016.
 "It's an incredible feeling to be able to head (to the sectional finals)," McDonald said. "I've personally have never been because we we've lost to (Wachusett) twice here and then to a different team team another game.
 "Outside of me personally, I just want our team to go as far as possible because I see the potential in some of our younger players and I just want this to be as great of an experience it can be for them."
 It was the third year in a row in which the Redhawks had faced the Mountaineers in the Central semifinals. Wachusett defeated Natick in 2018, 53-46, before going into overtime with them last year.
 Now, the Redhawks face top-seeded Franklin (22-0) in the sectional finals on Friday (8 p.m.) at Worcester State University.
 "This overtime, we had the momentum going our way," Redhawks (20-2) coach Dan Hinnenkamp said. "When we played them last year, I believe we were up by seven in the fourth quarter and then they got the momentum going.
 "I think I recall calling a timeout around the six minute mark maybe and I think we were down by seven and I said, 'Hey, there is a ton of time,' and we started chipping away and started playing good defense, we made some shots," Hinnenkamp added. "The rest of the team stepped up. Alana Ciccorelli, who was a tad hesitant hit a big bucket at the end, and I think we had a little bit of a momentum swing going our way and I think we carried that over into the overtime. Last year, we were on the wrong end of that momentum, this year, we were on the right side of that momentum."
 Natick trailed Wachusett (20-1) by as many as seven points in the fourth quarter but proceeded to finish the quarter on an 11-4 run to send it to an extra session.
 McDonald hit back to back layups to cut it to a one-possession game. After a layup by Charlotte Head brought the lead back up to five, senior Delaney Ross hit a pair of free throws and McDonald finished a layup with the harm to tie the game at 50. Head then came down with a layup on the other end to make it 52-50, Mountaineers but Cicorelli scored her only points of the game on a layup to tie it at 52 and force it to overtime.
 "This time it was just a mental game where we stayed in the game," McDonald said. "Even though we played down in the first half, we brought ourselves back up and didn't let it get into our heads, we just took it to them."
 McDonald specifically took it to Wachusett scoring 26 of her game-high 32 points in the second half and overtime.
 "It started with our defense and our confidence," McDonald said. "In the first half we were being too tentative, letting them control the pace and in the second half, especially in overtime, we just played our brand of basketball and get rebounds and we did well."
 "I think in the first half she was being a little bit hesitant," said Hinnenkamp of McDonald. "I told her at halftime that she hadn't attempted a free throw yet, which basically meant that she really wasn't taking it hard to the basket as we wanted and so second half, you can see the intensity in her eyes a little bit and I think just sheer will on her part. I thought she had a phenomenal second half.
 "I haven't seen her play that dominant in awhile," Hinnenkamp added. "She's had herself a good season. I thought she looked great against some teams, but she really in that second half, had a different mentality."
 The Redhawks struggled in the first half, being held to just four points in the first quarter. Natick trailed by as many as 11 in the second half before they began to chip away at the deficit.
 The Redhawks, led by McDonald went on an 8-0 run to cut their deficit to two, before Wachusett senior Belle Lanpher (25 points) hit a three at the end of the third quarter to give the Mountaineers a five point lead heading into the fourth quarter.

RICHMOND HILL, Ga. (WTOC) - Some local churches have stopped some religious practices as a preventive measure for the coronavirus.Something as simple as shaking hands or as Catholics call it the sign of peace has been suspended at St. Anne Catholic Church in Richmond Hill. Drinking from the common chalice is also something that has been put on hold in order to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.With millions of people frantically hurrying to stock up on hand sanitizer and other disinfectants, some local churches like St. Anne have taken precautions to make sure the virus doesn't spread among people in the community.Father Allan McDonald says they started eliminating certain practices when the influenza epidemic ran rapid in Georgia. He says since church is considered to be a place where people are in close contact, they felt it was necessary.He says now people who attend mass will only receive the consecrated bread.McDonald says since germs can be easily spread through touch, eliminating certain religious practices does interfere with their services, but it's necessary in order to keep people safe and healthy."It's a precaution obviously we don't want to become phobic about all of this because we have to live in a real world, but at least eliminating the common chalice and symbolically eliminating the sign of peace for the time being until all of this passes. It's a reminder that we should be taking precautions in general not just at church but everywhere we go and to be more health conscious,‚Äù Father McDonald said.McDonald says they encourage anyone who is sick to not attend mass. He says drinking from the common chalice and the sign of peace will be eliminated until further notice.Copyright 2020 WTOC. All rights reserved.

Charles ‚ÄúChuck‚Äù Trimble, a former leader of the National Congress of American Indians and founder of the American Indian Press Association, has died at age 84. The Oglala Lakota journalist and activist died of natural causes Monday in Omaha, Nebraska, his daughter, Kaiti Fenz-Trimble, said on Facebook. Trimble was born in Wanblee, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Reservation, and attended the then-Holy Rosary Mission boarding school. He graduated from the University of South Dakota, served in the U.S. Army and later studied journalism at the University of Colorado. Trimble founded the American Indian Press Association in the 1970s, citing a lack of coverage of Native American issues, Indian Country Today reported. It operated a news service for tribal newspapers across the U.S. He was then elected executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, an organization established to protect tribes' sovereign rights. He held the position from 1972 to 1978, calling it both a stressful and deeply rewarding time. ‚ÄúI was fortunate to have served through the decade most prolific in the enactment of legislation for new policy, programs, and resources, as well as executive actions favorable to Indian tribes and off-reservation Indian communities,‚Äù Trimble wrote in an address for the group's 2009 convention. ‚ÄúThese included the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, the Indian Financing Act, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and unprecedented return of significant lands to tribes.‚Äù Among his many accomplishments, Trimble helped start a newspaper on the Colville Reservation in Washington state to inform people about the implication of termination, the federal government's effort from the 1940s to the 1960s to disband tribes, Indian Country Today reported.

Last month my wife and I went to see the movie "1917." We understood that it was a good World War I story, with excellent cinematography. We were correct on both counts.
 What we didn't expect is that it would trigger memories from my tour of duty in Vietnam. I just never know when something lurking in the dark recesses of my mind will resurface, especially from that seminal time in my life.
 After the movie ended, as I sat in the rear of the theater regaining my composure and waiting for everyone else to leave, I realized that God gave me all I could handle back in 1970/1971 - no more and no less. With my wife sitting there beside me, I simply felt grateful to have survived myself and the war.
 The experience prompted me to write about Valentines Day 1971 in my February Food for Thought piece. Like other special days back on the home front, Valentines Day in the city of Qui Nhon was just another day in the 'Nam.
 I was one of the fortunate ones, blessed to come home in good health, raise a family and enjoy grandchildren. Others were not so lucky - so many sacrificed their lives and limbs.
 Although 1971 was towards the end of the war, the number of Americans killed or wounded in action that year was greater than in 1965, the first year of ground combat for U.S. infantry units.
 In the city of Qui Nhon, Operation Keystone - U.S. troop reduction and withdrawal - had begun. The more our military presence diminished, the more dangerous the city became.
 In that environment, despite having a wife and four little ones at home, I was more concerned with proving my courage than playing it safe. What was I thinking?
 Fortunately, God had other plans for me. I swear His hand reached down into the quagmire that was Qui Nhon and kept me safe from harm.
 He protected my body, but my mind was another thing entirely. The adrenaline rush experienced as a Military Police duty officer impacted me for years after the war, as did the survivor guilt which ate away at my soul. Now, in my 70s, I am finally at peace thanks to my loving wife and family, our Vet to Vet sessions at the Brockton VA and my association with a group of Plymouth Vietnam veterans and their Welcome Home Huey Helicopter float.
 I share this with you for two reasons. First, I'm quite sure my experience is not dissimilar to many of my comrades who returned home to an ungrateful nation after the war. Vietnam Veterans Day is celebrated on March 29th and my hope is that you will take some time this month to reflect upon their honorable service, during such a turbulent time in our nation's history.
 Second - there will be a fundraiser on April 25 at VFW Post 1822, located on 22 Seven Hills Road in Plymouth, to help our ad hoc Vietnam veterans group make repairs to our Huey Helicopter float. The Huey is the iconic symbol of the Vietnam War. Our float has been well received at parades and static displays throughout the South Shore for a number of years, but is now in need of an upgrade, particularly with Plymouth's 400th celebration just around the corner.

On Tuesday, a notice on Robinhood's website alerted clients that "We are experiencing a system-wide outage." The problems started to occur on Monday and lasted the entire day. Robinhood account holders were unable to take advantage of the largest single-day point gain in the history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average by exiting existing positions or by riding the rally for a day trade. And then yesterday, the market opened sharply higher and continued to rally as the U.S. Federal Reserve Board cut interest rates by 50 points. By the end of the day, the market had given up all of its gains and was sharply in the red again.
   
 Even before the outage extended into a second day, a Robinhood spokesman said, "We realize we let our customers down, and we‚Äôre committed to improving their experience." The spokesman also explained that the outage was caused by a problem with "infrastructure that allows our systems to communicate with each other." That prevented customers from using the Robinhood app, website, and help center.  
   
 "When it comes to your money, we know how important it is for you to have answers. The outages you have experienced over the last two days are not acceptable and we want to share an update on the current situation. Our team has spent the last two days evaluating and addressing this issue. We worked as quickly as possible to restore service, but it took us a while. Too long. We now understand the cause of the outage was stress on our infrastructure‚Äîwhich struggled with unprecedented load. That in turn led to a ‚Äúthundering herd‚Äù effect‚Äîtriggering a failure of our DNS system."-Robinhood
   
 Since Robinhood is a broker-dealer, it is required by regulatory agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to have a backup plan to cover situations when account holders cannot make changes to their holdings.

Technical chart claims that Avanos Medical, Inc. (AVNS) would settle between $32.81/share to $34.94/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $29.63 mark, then the market for Avanos Medical, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $28.57 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.25. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

But the bond market, which was among the earliest to flash red flags about the economic pain from the virus, was still showing caution. The yield on the 10-year Treasury recovered after falling to 0.98% and was trading at 1.02%, slightly above where it was late Tuesday. On Monday, it sank 0.08 percentage points and dipped below 1% for the first time in history. Yields fall when investors are worried about weaker economic growth and inflation.
 The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed actions, slumped to 0.65% from 0.71% as traders increase bets that the Fed will cut rates even deeper this year.
 Health care stocks in the S&P 500 jumped 5.4% for the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the index. UnitedHealth Group rose 13.7%, Anthem jumped 14.6% and Cigna climbed 14.1%.

 Technology stocks also drove much of the gains Wednesday. Apple climbed 3.4% and Microsoft rose 2.1%.
 Data reports released Wednesday painted a U.S. economy that was still holding up, at least as of last month. The country's services industries grew at a faster rate last month than economists expected, according to a report from the Institute for Supply Management. Hiring at private employers was stronger than expected in February, according to a report from payroll processor ADP, though slower than January's pace. That could be an encouraging sign for the comprehensive jobs report coming from the government at the end of the week.
 Markets have been on edge for two weeks, with the S&P 500 down 8.5% from its record on Feb. 19, amid worries about how much economic damage the coronavirus will do. The big swings in recent days will likely continue until investors get a sense of what the worst-case scenario really is in the virus outbreak. They need to see the number of new infections at least slow its acceleration, analysts say.
 Indexes jumped on Monday, and the Dow had its best day in more than a decade on rising anticipation for co-ordinated support from the Fed and other central banks. That followed a dismal week that erased gains for 2020.
 The tide rose for stocks around the world on Wednesday. In Europe, Germany's DAX returned 1.2%, the French CAC 40 rose 1.3% and the FTSE 100 in London gained 1.4%. In Asia, South Korea's Kospi jumped 2.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 inched up 0.1%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 0.2% and stocks in Shanghai rose 0.6%.

Without a charismatic unifier, the Democratic infighting gets nasty. Small but important segments of the party drift away. The early portion of the 2004 Democratic primary was one of the more angrily divided periods, with Howard Dean insisting he represented ‚Äúthe Democratic wing of the Democratic party‚Äù against a bunch of spineless sellouts, and Dick Gephardt calling Dean ‚Äúa fair- weather friend of the American worker.‚Äù The pair went at it hammer and tongs until the party decided to unite around the seemingly safe choice, Kerry, and the guy who came in second behind him, John Edwards. On paper, the 2004 Democrats should have been unified behind the safest choice. But Kerry flopped; his 59 million votes in 2004 were fewer than that of John McCain, who only won 22 states. In the exit polls, 11 percent of self-identified Democrats voted for Bush; just 6 percent of self-identified Republicans voted for Kerry.

PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. ‚Äî On Saturday night, around 5 p.m. by his watch, Kramer Robertson was at his Waco, Texas, home readying to go to a Baylor basketball game. He had primo seats, courtside, right behind the reigning NCAA national champs‚Äô bench. He‚Äôs got a hookup.That‚Äôs when his phone rang, better late than never.He would never get to his mom‚Äôs game.Robertson, the son of Baylor basketball coach Kim Mulkey, spent the next few hours packing ‚Äúfor the next six months, right‚Äù and readying for a 3 a.m. drive to Dallas to be there for the first flight to Florida. Ten days into games and more than two weeks into spring training, he got the call from the Cardinals to report to major-league spring training. Like now.Already sporting one of the largest rosters they‚Äôve ever had for spring training, the Cardinals called on Robertson as a reinforcement this past week because of injuries to infielders Yairo Munoz (hamstring) and Brad Miller (back). Munoz likely has a torn hamstring and is going to miss a month or more, and while Miller is expected back after Friday‚Äôs off day, the Cardinals had a handful of games and a split-squad doubleheader Thursday to cover. Enter Robertson ‚Äì a March callup.Manager Mika Shildt described Robertson as on ‚Äúred alert‚Äù ‚Äì no apparent Redbird pun intended ‚Äì and also noted that he met the prerequisite for a midspring promotion because he ‚Äúanswered his phone.‚Äù‚ÄúI was hoping to get it at the beginning,‚Äù Robertson said. ‚ÄúBut I just control what I can control, worry about what I can control. I have the opportunity now, and I‚Äôm thankful for it, and I‚Äôm eager to learn from these guys for as long as I can be here.‚ÄùRobertson, 25, spent the past season split between Class AA and Class AAA. The Cardinals‚Äô fourth-round pick in 2017, Robertson hit .231/.360/.365 and had an overall OPS of .724. He hit 11 homers and had 27 extra-base hits, but the bulk of his production came via his eye for the strike zone, and his willingness to take the walks offered. Often batting lower in the Redbirds and S-Cards orders, Robertson had 66 walks in 123 games. At Memphis, where he played 66 games in 2019, he had almost as many walks (39) as he had hits (44) ‚Äì and that was at a level where the pitchers show accelerated command before they head to the majors.All that time on base allowed Robertson opportunity to steal a handful, and he snagged 12 in Triple-A, but went 14-for-24 on steals overall.Back in Waco, Robertson, a product of LSU‚Äôs baseball program, was ramping up his baseball activity. He had planned to report to Jupiter, Fla., for minor-league camp on March 11 and ready for the first official workout on March 13. When he learned he wasn‚Äôt getting a non-roster invite to the Cardinals‚Äô major-league camp ‚Äì few non-roster infielders did ‚Äì Robertson reverse-engineered his winter to be ready for games on March 19.When he got the call before the Baylor Bears‚Äô 83-58 victory against Kansas State, Robertson had yet to face live pitching.Within 48 hours he was in a Grapefruit League game.It doesn‚Äôt matter when that call comes.It‚Äôs that it comes at all.Robertson woke up to his alarm, made his flight, went through a physical on Sunday, and was in big-league camp Monday, though not in the big-league clubhouse. That place is packed. No room. He was setup in the back of the facility, one of the few players in the minor-league clubhouse. Hanging in his locker was a No. 3, a number not issued on the big-league side of the campus this season but his from the minors. After going through drills Monday, he dressed for the game that afternoon ‚Äì and got in for a late at-bat. Had to get up to speed quickly.‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThen it was 99 mph.‚ÄùFirst look at a pitcher this spring.‚ÄúSlider, slider,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúThen 98, 99, sit down.‚ÄùStill, better than sitting back at home.No matter how good the seats are.
