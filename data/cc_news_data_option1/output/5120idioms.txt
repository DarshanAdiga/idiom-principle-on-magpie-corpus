Apple CFO Luca Maestri and former Apple chief design officer Jony Ive are reportedly two candidates being considered for the newly-vacant CEO position of Ferrari. Louis Camilleri abruptly retired as the Ferrari CEO "with immediate effect" on Thursday. Camilleri's retirement announcement cited "personal reasons," and no further details were made available. Chairman John Elkann will lead Ferrari on an interim basis until a permanent successor is found. Rumours were rife on social media that the soon to take over CEO of FIA F1 Stefano Domenicali could take over as the CEO of Ferrari. However, a spokesman for F1 dismissed rumours that the former head of Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team and ex-Lamborghini chief Stefano Domenicali could take Camilleri's role, saying he was looking forward to starting his new job as F1 CEO from January 1st 2021, as planned. According to Italian media reports Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao is also in the running for the CEO position at Ferrari, but Reuters says that such claims are "groundless." Interestingly, it seems that top contenders for the post are the two executives with close ties to Apple. Citing Italian media reports, Reuters says that Apple CFO Luca Maestri and former chief design officer Jony Ive are "possible candidates" for the Ferrari CEO position. Maestri has served as Apple's CFO since 2014, having previously served as the company's vice president of finance and corporate controller. Jony Ive departed Apple back in 2019 after 30 years, holding the title of chief design officer at the time of his departure. Ive, is noted as the chief designer of the iconic iPhones. He has formed his own independent design firm, named LoveFrom. Apple is a client of LoveFrom, but the extent of the relationship is unclear. Airbnb recently announced a multi-year partnership with Jony Ive and the LoveFrom design firm. 2020 has been a difficult year for Ferrari. The sales figures are down and the coveted Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team is going through one of their worst slumps in performance. Heading into the final race tonight of the FIA F1 2020 season, Ferrari is in the 6th place in the Constructors Standings with just 131 points compared to the World Champions Mercedes which 540 points under their belt. A total of 10 teams competed in the 2020 Formula One World Championship.

The other night my son and I watched the movie “Home Alone.” I love that movie. It reminds me of growing up in the ’90s. As a kid, our family had the movie on VHS and would watch it on Sunday nights in December, usually after church, while eating pizza. And in case you are curious, it was a cheese pizza, just like what Kevin McCallister preferred.
 My son cackled loudly at the airport scene where the family was running frantically through Chicago O’Hare trying to avoid missing their flight to Paris. I admit, it was funny. But as we were laughing, I noticed something quite interesting about that clip. All the passengers in the airport were dressed nicely. Men were wearing neckties and sweaters. The ladies were festively dressed in their holiday best, adorned with jewelry, and meticulously applied makeup. Everyone was, well, putting their best foot forward. It doesn’t take an academic study to demonstrate that people were simply better dressed back then and that we as a culture have let ourselves backslide in appearance over these last few decades.
 There is a substantial lack of interest — and in some cases blatant disdain — for the personal aesthetic. We have become so frightened of being labeled uppity that, in my humble opinion, we have whipsawed ourselves into the opposite direction. Or worse, we’ve become patently lazy. Perhaps in order to salvage some semblance of self-respect as a society, let’s assume it’s the former in lieu of the latter.
 I love to see old street scene photos from the early 20th century. From time to time the JC Press publishes black and white pictures from the 1930s to 1960s of downtown shoppers. One can’t help but take notice of how put together everyone was in their heels and top hats. Back then when you went in public, you looked presentable, no matter your socioeconomic position.
 A nicely dressed person is telling you many things. They are saying that you are important to them and that you are worth the effort it took to get ready. They are telling the world that they take themselves seriously, and that you should too. How you dress will 100% directly affect how you feel about yourself (in case you are interested, social scientists refer to this as Enclothed Cognition). Turns out the whole “look good, feel good” thing happens to be more than just a catchy slogan. Incidentally, as an employer I can promise you that how a prospective employee presents themself is very important to me. And if any other corporation says otherwise, they are likely kowtowing to social pressures and/or their public relations department. But in the end, they are lying, because they absolutely care about appearance.
 I mean, just go to any airport nowadays. You’ll see people wearing actual pajamas with Lord-knows-what written on them. And while we’re on the airport thing, let’s not forget about those who are talking so loud on their cell phone, you wonder if they want others to hear them and how important they are. A little bit of social grace goes a long way. I’m not really sure one’s cell phone habits has much to do with one’s dress, but I must admit that I found the foregoing rant wonderfully therapeutic.
 You’ll never hear me argue we should always be dressed to the nines. In no world should everyday life look like the set of Downton Abbey. It is neither necessary nor practical.
 On the weekends my go-to attire is overalls, sweatpants, or gym shorts (depending on the activity of course). But when it’s date night with the wife, I always attempt to dress befitting with the dining venue. It demonstrates respect for her and for our time together. And frankly, I appreciate her efforts to dress as the elegant lady that she is. I suppose the bottom line is that our culture could use a little more formality.
 COVID has understandably forced us all to become more casual. I’d love to get a glimpse of any mainstream retailer’s financial books. I bet the loungewear sector has blown up over the prior three quarters. But COVID will end soon enough. And when it does, let’s get out that dress shirt and make 2021 a tad more formal. The culture will thank you.

In questo modo Sam sarebbe stato a tutti gli effetti il tipico giovane idealista di per cui Steve avrebbe provato rispetto e che avrebbe addestrato, diventando quindi una serpe in seno pronta a essere scatenata quando meno se lo sarebbe aspettato. La manipolazione del Cubo Cosmico, però, è stata più efficace di quanto il Teschio Rosso si aspettasse. Falcon ormai è completamente redento ed è troppo legato a Cap e alla giustizia. Riesce quindi a liberarsi dal giogo mentale del malvagio e decide di prendersi la responsabilità delle sue azioni passate come Snap Wilson, accettando di andare a processo. Anche il giudice riconoscerà come egli sia diventato un uomo diverso e deciderà di lasciarlo libero. Il fatto che, poco prima, l'eroe avesse salvato tutti da un attacco congiunto di Stilt-Man e di Trapster non ha sicuramente influenzato il verdetto! La personalità malvagia di Snap Wilson riemergerà solo molti anni dopo. Scarlet, impazzita e in procinto di scatenare l'attacco che avrebbe distrutto gli Avengers, utilizza i suoi poteri altera- realtà per logorare lentamente i compagni. Fa ripiombare Tony Stark nell'alcolismo, illude sentimentalmente un già confuso Capitan America e, per l'appunto, fa riemergere il lato malvagio di Falcon portandolo ad allontanarsi dall'amico. Solo un attentato di un Cap impostore ridarà lucidità all'eroe e cancellerà definitivamente l'ombra del suo passato.
