Once guest artists signed on, it was critical to get their creative teams involved, in deciding on a set of songs to feature on their episode. “The artists don’t hear anything [prior to filming], but their trusted counterparts have helped us vet the material, so we’re at least in the ballpark. It would be terrible if we presented four songs that were just not creatively anywhere the artist wanted to be. I mean, that would just be a really big mess,” Morrissey says. “So, we needed to come up with a process, so that the artist has some creative safety net, if they’re going to go on a show, and basically sign up for saying, ‘Yes, I’m going to cut and release a song from the show.’”

Anthony J. "Tony" Brignole III was born September 29, 1946, at St. Joseph Hospital in Memphis. He was affectionately known by his family as" Sonny". He passed away on June 17, 2020, at Methodist Hospice House.      He was preceded in death by his parents Anthony J. Brignole, Jr. and Mary Margaret Warner Brignole as well as his younger brother, Ron. He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Mary Hendrick Brignole, daughter Angela Brignole Schreiner (Kyle) and granddaughter, Dorothy Elizabeth Schreiner as well as by his sisters, Rita Brignole Pellegrin (Hank), Theresa Brignole Seviek (Joe), and brother James. Other survivors include nieces Stacey Pellegrin Peeney (Mike), Sarah Brignole Cannon (Phil), Laura Brignole Raptis (Jon), Amy Brignole, Tracey Brignole Bowman (Josh), nephew/godson Hank Pellegrin, Jr. (Christi), nephew Paul Hendrick, (Catherine) and godson Joe Warner III (Jenny).      Tony graduated from Catholic High for Boys in 1964. After high school, he was among the first graduates of the new Chemical Engineering Department at Christian Brothers College (CBC). While a student, he was president of the student chapter of AIChe. He later served as president of the CBC alumni association. Upon graduation, he began a 27-year engineering career with DuPont/ICI Acrylics. Early in his tenure, he obtained his professional engineer's license. He also obtained a real estate broker's license and worked part-time with his father at Brignole Realty.      He and his colleagues at DuPont were some of the early graduates of the Mechanical Engineering graduate program at Memphis State. Post-retirement he was sought after as an acrylics expert, consulting around the world with such companies as American Standard, for whom he designed and helped start-up their plant near Cairo, Egypt. Tony was the consummate engineer who enjoyed his profession and was always happy with his career choice.      One of Tony's favorite hobbies was amateur (HAM) radio. He served as president of the Mid-South Amateur Radio Association (MARA). Always willing to help fellow "hams" with radio issues, he amassed quite a collection of radio test equipment. Ever an innovator, he founded "Freefest", a sort of radio vendor sales and swap meet at which prospective hams could also come to take licensure exams. Proceeds from prize ticket sales at the event were donated to Methodist LeBonheur Children's hospital. He was Chairman of the event for ten years before stepping away, but the event continues to be a great success. He was presented with the Marconi award by the American Radio Relay League and the Clayton Elam award by MARA.      A natural leader, Tony was the Country Club Estates Homeowners Association board president for several terms. He was always ready and willing to repair anything that needed it.      He had an incredible love for animals and was known by many to rescue or help animals in need. He rescued the family cat Bismark, and several canine family members Jackson, Juliette, and Iris over the years. He loved them dearly and missed them after their deaths.      Another one of his many passions was cooking. He took classes at the Viking cooking school and served there as a volunteer. He thoroughly enjoyed entertaining friends and hosted the best parties! At home, he loved whipping up such treats as white chocolate bread pudding, tiramisu, and cherries jubilee. He was especially talented at barbecuing and judging barbecue contests. When asked where the best ribs in Memphis were, his son-in-law Kyle replied, "at my father-in-law's house".      In addition to his love for culinary arts, Tony also loved the performing arts and served on the board of the Tennessee Ballet Company. During his service, he was instrumental in bringing both Mikhail Baryshnikov and Rudolf Nureyev to perform in Memphis.      He was a devout Catholic and longtime member of St. James parish. Tony never missed mass until he was in the hospital. Whether traveling abroad on business or vacation, he always sought out the nearest Catholic church and checked out the mass times in advance. He was dismayed at the fire damage to Notre Dame Cathedral where he and Mary had attended mass in the past. His other favorite cathedrals to visit were in New Orleans, New York, and Rome-his favorite cities. He was blessed to have attended mass at St. Peter's Square celebrated by the Pope during the recent holy year.      The family wishes to express appreciation to the staff at Methodist Hospice House, Functional Independence Home Health Care and Senior Care Management as well as all who cared for him at Methodist University Hospital.      Canale Funeral Directors has been entrusted with arrangements. Cfuneral@comcast.net. Visitation will begin at 12noon on Friday, June 26, 2020, at St. James Catholic Church, 4180 Leroy Avenue 38108. Funeral mass will follow at 1 o'clock with interment afterward at Calvary Cemetery.      *Attendees at the visitation and/or funeral mass will be required to wear masks and practice social distancing according to policies in place with the Catholic Diocese of Memphis and St. James Parish.       In lieu of flowers the family requests donations in Tony's memory to Street Dog Foundation, St. James Church, or Christian Brothers University.

China reported 22 new cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, including 13 in Beijing, a day after a city government spokesperson said containment measures had slowed the momentum of an outbreak in the capital that has infected more than 200 people. Another nine cases were brought by Chinese travelers from outside the country, seven of them on board a flight from Saudi Arabia that arrived in Gansu province, according to a notice from the provincial government. While the situation in Beijing is headed in the right direction, “the prevention situation remains grave and complex,” city spokesperson Xu Hejian said. The Beijing outbreak took hold in a huge wholesale food market crowded with workers and buyers. Additional cases traced to the same outbreak have been found in neighboring Hebei province and nearby Tianjin city.

European officials said the list would be revised every two weeks to reflect new realities around the world as nations see the virus ebb and flow.
 The process of agreeing on it has been challenging, with diplomats from all European member states hunkering down for multiple hourslong meetings for the past few weeks.
 As of Tuesday, the officials and diplomats were poring over two versions of the safe list under debate and were scheduled to meet again Wednesday to continue sparring over the details.
 One list contains 47 countries and includes only those nations with an infection rate lower than the EU average. The other longer list has 54 countries and also includes those nations with slightly worse case rates than the EU average, going up to 20 new cases per 100,000 people.
 The existing restrictions on nonessential travel to all 27 member states plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein were introduced March 16 and extended twice until July 1, in a bid to contain the virus as the continent entered a three-month long confinement.
 “Discussions are happening very intensively,” to reach consensus in time for July 1, said Adalbert Jahnz, a spokesman for the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch. He called the process “frankly, a full-time job.”
 The EU agency for infectious diseases, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, warned negotiators that the case numbers were so dependent on the level of truthfulness and testing in each country that it was hard to vouch for them, officials taking part in the talks said.
 China, for example, has been accused of withholding information and manipulating the numbers of infections released to the public. In parts of the developing world, case numbers are very low, but it’s hard to determine whether they paint an accurate picture given limited testing.
 And in the United States, comments made by Trump at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, over the weekend highlighted how easy it is to manipulate a country’s case numbers, as he suggested that domestic testing was too broad.

Trump, as well as his Russian and Brazilian counterparts, Vladimir Putin and Jair Bolsonaro, have followed what critics call a comparable path in their pandemic response that leaves all three countries in a similarly bad spot: They were dismissive at the outset of the crisis, slow to respond to scientific advice and saw a boom of domestic cases as other parts of the world, notably in Europe and Asia, were slowly managing to get their outbreaks under control.
 Countries on the EU draft lists have been selected as safe based on a combination of epidemiological criteria. The benchmark is the EU average number of new infections — over the past 14 days — per 100,000 people, which is currently 16 for the bloc. The comparable number for the United States is 107, while Brazil’s is 190, and Russia’s is 80, according to a Times database.
 Once diplomats agree on a final list, it will be presented as a recommendation early next week before July 1. The EU can’t force members to adopt it, but European officials warn that failure of any of the 27 members to stick to it could lead to the reintroduction of borders within the bloc.
 The reason this exercise is additionally complex for Europe is that, if internal borders are open but member states don’t honor the same rules, visitors from nonapproved nations could land in one European country and then jump onward to other EU nations undetected.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Regrouping after a humbling weekend rally, President Donald Trump faces another test of his ability to draw a crowd during a pandemic Tuesday as he visits Arizona and tries to remind voters of one of his key 2016 campaign promises.Trump’s weekend rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was meant to be a sign of the nation’s reopening and a show of political force but instead generated thousands of empty seats and swirling questions about the president’s campaign leadership and his case for another four years in office. The low turnout has sharpened the focus on Trump’s visit to Arizona, which doubles as both a 2020 battleground state and a surging coronavirus hot spot.“We actually had a nice crowd, and -- despite all of the warnings and everything else that other networks were trying to do,” Trump said of Tulsa as he departed for Arizona, again blaming reports about protests and “bad people” for keeping away his supporters.First, the president will travel to Yuma to mark the construction of more than 200 miles (322 kilometers) of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, an issue that he built his campaign on four years ago. Later, he'll address a group of young Republicans at a Phoenix megachurch, where event organizers have pledged thousands will attend.Throughout the trip, the COVID-19 pandemic will shadow Trump. The Democratic mayor of Phoenix made clear that she does not believe the speech can be safely held in her city — and urged the president to wear a face mask.“Everyone attending tomorrow’s event, particularly any elected official, should set an example to residents by wearing a mask,” said Mayor Kate Gallego. “This includes the President.”Trump has refused to wear a mask in public, instead turning it into a red-vs.-blue cultural issue. Polling suggests that Republicans are far less likely to wear a face covering than Democrats despite health experts’ warnings that it dramatically reduces the risk of transmitting the virus.The “Students for Trump” event will be held at the Dream City Church and broadcast to groups across the nation. Students for Trump is a special project of Turning Point Action, a grouped chaired by Trump ally Charlie Kirk, which is hosting the president for his address. Organizers said health and safety measures still were being finalized and it was unclear if attendees would be asked to wear masks or keep socially distant.Since late May, Arizona has emerged as one of the nation’s most active hot spots for the spread of COVID-19. Use of hospitals, intensive care units and ventilators has set daily records over the past week.Photos of restaurants and bars crowded with unmasked patrons ignited controversy. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, a Trump supporter, reversed himself last week and allowed cities and counties to require people to wear masks in public places. Most have, including Phoenix and Yuma and the counties that surround them.Arizona is seeing disturbing trends in several benchmarks, including the percentage of tests that prove positive for the virus, which is the highest in the nation.The state’s positive test rate is at a seven-day average of 20.4%, well above the national average of 8.4% and the 10% level that public health officials say is a problem.Campaign officials are still assessing the fallout from low turnout in Tulsa amid concern about the virus.Campaign officials stressed that rallies would remain a staple of the president’s reelection strategy but allowed that they may, in certain states, need to change slightly. Discussions were under way about having them in more modest venues or outdoors, perhaps in airplane hangers and amphitheaters, or in smaller cities away from likely protesters.But officials believe that Trump’s ability to draw thousands of supporters out during a pandemic sets up a favorable contrasting image with Democratic rival Joe Biden. Still, the campaign has struggled to find effective attack lines on Biden.Biden, like Trump, has had struggles with young voters but the former vice president’s campaign has expressed hope that the national protests against racial injustice may change that.Trump’s visit to the Phoenix megachurch will come on the same day that Pence kicks off a faith-centered tour, highlighting the central position that religious conservatives -– particularly white evangelicals, but also right-leaning Catholics -– continue to occupy in the president’s base. Yet even as Trump’s campaign overtly courts religious voters, there are signs of softening support among voting blocs the president can’t afford to lose.A poll released earlier this month by the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute found that the share of white Catholics viewing Trump favorably had fallen by double digits since last year, measuring 37% in the last week of May compared with 49% across 2019. The same poll found Trump’s favorability among white evangelicals at 62% in May, a level comparable to 2019′s — but 15% less than it was in March.Trump's focus on construction of his long-promised border wall also is meant to shore up support with his most loyal supporters.His administration has promised to build 450 miles (724 kilometers) by the end of the year, but that seems unlikely. The government has awarded more than $6.1 billion in construction contracts since April 2019 for various projects along the border. It has also waived procurement rules that critics say make the process of awarding multi-million dollar contracts secretive and opaque.“We’re celebrating,” Trump said. “We have over 200 miles of wall built. It’s been incredible.”Trump’s first visit to the border in more than a year comes a day after another hardline immigration move. The Trump administration said Monday that it was extending a ban on green cards issued outside the United States until the end of the year and adding many temporary work visas to the freeze, including those used heavily by technology companies and multinational corporations.The administration cast the effort as a way to free up jobs in an economy reeling from the coronavirus.___Associated Press writers Jonathan Cooper and Astrid Galvan in Phoenix and Elana Schor in New York contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.
