O baby, what a year 2020 has been! I don’t know what I was expecting, but it wasn’t anything like my imagination. We did squeak out our winter vacation only to come back to shut downs, cancellations, rationing and fear. Yuck! Who would have thought toilet paper would become so important? And we didn’t even get to discussing the election media frenzy.
 As the year progressed, I began to notice that I was not handling loss very well. I was a bit weepy. What was going on? Like any emotion, our minds lump all similar feelings together in a messy stew pot of funk. It’s hard to sort out where the emotions are coming from and why they are unusually intense. Loss. There I said it again. Each time I couldn’t hug a friend or see my grandkids or just go to the local watering hole for a hangout beverage, my emotions were triggering loss at a hurricane force. My mind was filling the emotional stew pot with memories of our dads who we lost in the last two years. Then my mind would jump to lost expectations and even to high school disappointments. Yuck again.
 I tried to learn new skills and be positive. It worked most of the time, but then a new loss would come and I my thoughts would spiral again. To finish out the year, Brad and I got COVID. Triple yuck! Lots of time to think too much. I needed hope I would feel better, hope I could see my family again, hope life really would be able to function if I was gone for two weeks. O baby, what an emotional and physical ride.
 But then Jesus opened the clouds of hope just as we were coming out of the COVID fog. Little Miss Adeline Lynn. She is our beautiful gift of hope born in December. Grandchildren are the delight and wonder of our lives. A chance to cheer on our kids in their great parenting skills while secretly thankful we are past that journey. And that is just it. O baby, has it been a year of journey. I almost lost sight that life keeps moving on no matter the emotions of the moment.

She said the issuance of traffic citations, a revenue source, is down, narcotics enforcement might be impacted, and subsequently there could be fewer drug arrests; police training was limited and only three officers were patrolling the borough some nights.
 During Wednesday’s virtual meeting, council also voted to increase the 2021 property tax millage rate from 6.52 to 6.96 mills. A mill is a levy of one tenth of one percent of assessed property values.
 Councilwoman Lisa Dorsey was told that all of the officers suggested for hiring by Herrin were white.
 State mandates and civil service requirements make it especially challenging to diversify the police force, Herrin said.
 “It’s something we’ve struggled with for years,” said Borough Council President Michael Galey, about hiring a more diverse department.
 Police Chief Jim Morehead said the department had taken “a lot of extra effort” to diversify.
 “We will dig deep into this issue until we find a solution,” Herrin said.
 The following four candidates as new borough police officers were recommended to council by Mayor Herrin:
 Kory Thompson — He is a West Chester University graduate, with a Bachelors Degree in Marketing. Thompson obtained his training under Act 120 at Delaware County Community College in 2019. He worked for the Temple University Police Department from Aug. 2019 to Sept. 2020. He now works for Upper Dublin Township Police Department and is enlisted in the PA National Guard.
 Ross Blue — He is a 2009 graduate of Springfield High School and served in the U.S. Marine Corps. He attended the San Bernardino Valley College Police Academy in 2015 and worked for the San Bernardino California Police Department from Jan. 2015 to Jan 2020. His training with the police department included computer systems, tactical combat, casualty care, gang enforcement, narcotics enforcement, and crisis intervention and behavioral health. He currently works part-time for the Chester Township Police Department.
 Robert Kuehn — He is a 2019 graduate of York College with a Bachelors of Science Degree in Criminal Justice. He graduated from Delaware County Municipal Police Academy on Dec. 11, 2020.
 James Ensor — Ensor is a graduate of Penn State University, with dual Bachelor of Arts Degrees in National Security and African Studies. He obtained his Act 120 Certification from DCCC in January of 2020. He has been employed as a part-time officer with the East Fallowfield Township Police Department since Feb. 2020.

Again, the situation looks different in the medium segment referred to earlier. To the extent that there was a temporary demand shock, short-time work was deployed heavily to stabilise jobs and incomes for those unable to work from home, trying to avoid dismissals or at least postpone them (for the time being) for the core workforce. This is particularly relevant where skills are specific and where a return to existing jobs is perceived as a valid option.

 Several lawmakers also credited the evangelical community for building support for criminal justice reform among Republicans. Judiciary Committee Chairman Filler said this was an issue of special importance to Speaker Lee Chatfield, son of an evangelical minister who was involved in a prison ministry. (Chatfield declined to be interviewed for this story.)
 Lawmakers don't plan to stop working on criminal justice reform after this session ends. The commission co-chaired by Gilchrist and McCormack made recommendations that the legislature did not act on this year, including provisions to divert people with mental illness away from jail. Lawmakers from rural areas also want to make it easier to wipe arrests for driving under the influence, a common offense outside major cities, from criminal records.
 "You've had this left-and-right Kumbaya moment on criminal justice reform for the past couple years," said David Guenthner with the conservative think tank the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. "The objective should be to use prison for those we are scared of, not those we are mad at. And when someone's coming out of prison, they should have sufficient training and opportunity to earn a living and be a success."

Entrevistado por Rotativo, indicó que han mantenido reuniones con diferentes dependencias como parte de las actividades de la comisión, con el objetivo de seguir gestionando más beneficios a la ciudadanía.
 Apuntó que están a la espera de poder capacitar a la gente de este sector, con platicas de como cuidar el campo, para beneficio propio y de la comunidad.
 Reconoció que, a pesar de las limitantes para el acceso a los recursos para el campo, el municipio también estará buscando esquemas para seguir respaldando a todas las familias que dependen de esta actividad.
 Comentó que derivado de las pláticas, los campesinos han externado su preocupación por el abandono al sector, por lo que dijo que será permanente el acercamiento a través de las diferentes áreas del gobierno municipal.
 “El sector solicita más apoyos y la reapertura a los programas federales que ya existían y que los programas que ya existen que no sean complicados en el tema de su tramitología”, mencionó.
 Por último, Germain Garfias, señaló que de acuerdo a la información de los propios productores del campo, este año cerrarán de manera crítica, ya que por una parte la pandemia los afectó y por otro la temporada de lluvias no los favoreció.
 “El sector serrará un año complicado no solo por la pandemia, sino por la sequía, debido a que las presas no han tendido mucha captación de agua y los diferentes tipos de cambio que se han presentado en la entidad han hecho complicada la travesía de este año para el sector”, puntualizó.

While rates higher than 5% are considered concerning and no area counties dipped below that mark, this week was a substantial improvement from last week and the four prior weeks. Compared to five counties having at least a 9% rate last week, Faribault County’s 9% rate was the highest in the region this week.
 Blue Earth and Nicollet counties both nearly dipped below 5%. Blue Earth County’s 5.4% rate, a drop from 8% the week before, was the lowest in south- central Minnesota. Nicollet County’s 5.7% was the next lowest, a drop from 7.5%.
 Both were among the 15 counties in Minnesota with the lowest positivity rates this week. South-central Minnesota’s overall 6.7% positivity rate was also lower than Minnesota’s rate as a whole.
 Derek J. Wingert, a local volunteer analyst with the COVID Tracking Project, said this week’s encouraging numbers look to be part of a “solid trend of improvements” in recent weeks. On top of the lower positivity rates in area counties, he noted how there weren’t any outliers in the county rates this week.
 “Another thing that’s interesting, you’ll see that in the last month or so the degree of variability between the countries in the region seems to be decreasing a bit,” he added.
 Weeks in November did have fairly large gaps between area counties with the highest and lowest positivity rates. In the week ending on Nov. 11, for example, the highest rate was 22.8% in Le Sueur County and the lowest was 4.8% in Watonwan County.
 The last two weeks, in contrast, featured more tightly grouped rates from top to bottom. The difference between the high and low rates in area counties was only 3.7% and 3.6% last week and this week.
 The latest positivity rates stem from fewer new tests and cases this week both statewide and in the south-central region. The nine area counties combined for 11,857 new tests between Dec. 9-16, an 18.1% drop from the 14,470 tests between Dec. 2-9.
 New cases during the same periods, however, dropped by even more. The 792 new cases in the nine counties this week were a 37.2% drop from the 1,261 cases confirmed in the prior week.

For years, Michigan courts have been taking away peoples' drivers licenses for reasons that have nothing to do with their behavior behind the wheel.
 Instead, suspending the right to drive has been used as a cudgel to get people to pay traffic tickets, court fines, or child support. But because people need to work in order to afford to pay these fees, thousands thousands of them have been driving on suspended licenses in order to get to work. And if they got caught, they wind up in jail.
 Today, driving on a suspended license is one of the leading reasons Michiganders wind up in jail, and the system often appears more designed to squeeze money out of the state's poorest citizens rather than as a tool to ensure public safety. It's part of the reason the state's jail population has tripled over the past 30 years even as crime rates have fallen to a 50-year low.
 No one knew how seriously out of whack the jail system had become until earlier this year, when a first-of-its-kind commission took a look at who was going to jail and why. And now, when Michigan has become emblematic of just how broken our political system has become -- with right-wing terrorists plotting to kidnap the state's Democratic governor and some Republicans working to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the state -- lawmakers who are often at each others' throats are determined to make big change before they adjourn for the year. By the time the state legislature wraps up this week, it will have advanced more than two dozen criminal justice reform bills.
