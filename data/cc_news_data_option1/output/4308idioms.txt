His first pass, whether accurate or incomplete or his first game, whether a win or a loss, will not depict how his career will play out. There is no question that Tua Tagovailoa, one of the most prolific and accomplished college quarterbacks ever, has the elite skill-set to be a star at the next level. You cannot teach poise, composure, humility, being clutch, or winning. Couple that with his elite accuracy, timing, and arm talent and the Dolphins could finally have something to work with. Tua, the Dolphins 22ndstarting quarterback in 21 years, is undoubtedly the most talented out of the pack, which is why so many Dolphins fans around the world are ecstatic.

This leads to another reason, the future. Barring an injury, the move to Tagovailoa is a long-term decision. This is not like last year when the Dolphins wanted to give Josh Rosen a chance and ended up going back to Fitzpatrick after Rosen played poorly. This is Tua’s team now and hopefully for the next decade-plus. Even if Tua plays poorly in his first few outings, Ryan Fitzpatrick will not be brought back. The goal for the remaining ten games is to groom Tua for the 2021 season. Any type of accolades or playoff appearances this season is just a bonus. Getting rid of the “rookie bumps” and catching him up to NFL speed is the most important task so Tua, and the team, can hit the ground running in 2021.

For the older generations, do you remember that Monty Python sketch, Bicycle Repair Man? In a team full of superheroes in capes, attacking talents that steal all the headlines, Rankin-Costello offers something different: a pumping of tyres, a tightening of bolts, fixing the chain.
 He doesn't possess the explosive speed of Tyrhys Dolan or Harvey Elliott, nor does he boast the terrifyingly tight control that Adam Armstrong has in his locker. But he makes up for that with his Ox-like features, his incredible perception of the game and, most of all, his piece du resistance; the sweet delivery of either pass or cross, whether it be short or long, diagonal or horizontal, in-swinging or out-swinging.
 Both he and Douglas were afforded a licence to attack, with both instilling a fear into the Coventry back line with a series of hazardous crosses. There was another stirring, unrewarded run down the right channel as Elliott teed up another Rankin-Costello in-swinger. It was on a plate for Holtby to direct towards goal, and yet his header grazed the wrong side of the woodwork and yet another Rovers attack went down as a missed opportunity.
 Fortunately the series of missed chances never came back to haunt Mowbray's side, and Rankin-Costello was still at his imperious best in the second-half, supporting Elliott as more of a right-sided midfielder than a right-back. During the second goal, as Brereton slipped Armstrong through for his second, Rankin-Costello had darted forward and occupied a position that, if you were to assess Rovers' formation at that exact point, would suggest they were playing a 3-3-4 system.
 So while everyone was lauding the 'BAE' partnership of Brereton, Armstrong and Elliott in attack, Rankin-Costello was marauding up and down the right flank trying to make Elliott's life as easy as possible. He expanded the pitch, offered an external outlet and created space just through his persistent movement and understanding of how the system flows and filters through different transitions. It's no wonder he was blowing out of his cheeks by the end of the match, and is a reminder of the physical demands expected in the full-back position.
 It was another excellent performance from the 20-year-old, and not only from an attacking sense either. Defensively he encountered very few troubles and with Darragh Lenihan persistently in his ear instructing him on where he should be positioned, whether to press or sit off, Rankin-Costello was able to fend off the lively Callum O'Hare and the overlapping Ryan Giles for large portions of the game. Let's not forget, this is not his natural position either. For a player who has 15 Championship appearances to his name in his entire career to be performing in a position he's had relatively little experience in during the development squad and younger phases is pretty impressive.
 So we leave St Andrew's with a bit of a conundrum to solve, don't we? We all love Ryan Nyambe, and there is substance in any suggestion that he could be one of the better full-backs in the division, but in this current system Rankin-Costello has the edge.
 And the numbers quite frankly don't lie in this instance. In the four league games Joe Rankin-Costello has played this season, Rovers have won three, scoring 15 and conceding just two. Of the games he has played at right-back, Rovers have won all three, scoring 13 and keeping three clean sheets in the process.
 It follows on from the previous campaign. Utilised at left-back against Bristol City and Cardiff City, Rovers win both encounters, scoring three in each. Results of course dipped off by the end of the campaign but in no way was that through the fault of Rovers' versatile star.
 The statistics between Rankin-Costello and Nyambe are pretty similar across the board. Both average one key pass per game, the pair have registered one assist each and their crossing numbers equate to an average of 0.4 in each game.
 Defensively they're both identical, with the pair both attempting 15 successful tackles across the campaign so far. Individually both have been excellent and yet, from a team perspective, Mowbray is well aware of the benefits Rankin-Costello currently brings over Nyambe as Rovers require an added attacking impetus from their full-backs.
 "I think it was an amazing ball for the penalty," praised Mowbray after the game. "Things that we work on, things that we talk about and some of the delivery and the pass from those areas hasn't been quite right, from both left and right, which is why we have both full-backs focusing on that area of the pitch.
 "Ryan and Belly both know that they have to work everyday on delivering forward and Joe Rankin hit a pass today that was of real top quality.
 "Joe Rankin-Costello is a young boy who deserves a lot of praise. He's been out injured for a couple of weeks. I had every intention of not getting him through 90 minutes and giving him a break and making sure he didn't injure himself again, because that has been an issue for us. He does find the intensity difficult and he has broken down several times with his hamstrings but I'm pleased he got through it and pleased he did well."
 With the congestion of fixtures, Mowbray is wary of having to preserve Rankin- Costello. Nyambe will inevitably be recalled at some stage but the Namibian acknowledges he must elevate his game during a period where Rankin-Costello's positive influence on the Rovers team has yet to show any signs of ceasing.

Also, the caliphate had come to know that the elite among the Shia believed that the Eleventh Imam, according to traditions cited by him as well as his forefathers, would have a son who was the promised Mahdi (AJ). The coming of the Mahdi had been foretold in authenticated hadith of the Prophet in both Sunni and Shia sources. For this reason the Eleventh Imam, more than other Imams, was kept under close watch by the caliphate. The caliph of the time had decided definitely to put an end to the Imamate in Shi'ism through every possible means and to close the door to the Imamate once and for all. The eleventh Imam’s era was characterized by a notable growth in the Shia presence throughout the Muslim world. A secret network of representatives which was maintained during Imam Al-Hadi’s (AS) time was expanded widely under Imam Hassan Askari’s (A.S) direction.

He discovered he preferred being backstage, behind the scenes, to being onstage. After reading a lot of bad scripts, he decided he was better off writing and telling stories so he moved to L.A. with his writing partner, Michael Gleason (“McCloud,” “Remington Steele”).
 Beginning in the early 1960s, Blinn wrote for numerous series including westerns such as “Rawhide,” “Bonanza” and “Gunsmoke,” as well as “The Interns” and “The Rookies.”
 His work as an executive producer and writer on the television adaptation of “Fame,” based on the film by Alan Parker, inspired constant letters from fans and admirers of the series, some of whom said it inspired them to start their own performing arts programs in their local schools, Blinn recalled in a soul- searching 2001 op-ed for The Times. The addition of music and choreography in the “Fame” franchise brought Blinn new terrain to write upon.
 “When we did it right, we managed to put together the script and storytelling and the music, in such a way that they just went together,” he said in an oral history recorded by the Television Academy. “And when you have Debbie Allen on camera, you got the energy and the drive and professionalism you don’t get in many places.”

Collins drove in Turpin with a single. Then the middle of the order struck. Miller helped her cause with a 2-run homer to right field.
 “It was amazing,” Miller said. “It was just the icing on the cake with a game like this. Coming out out of our last game, I was kind of in a slump and it was just amazing. I saw the ball and I just took it.”
 Sydnee Deen followed by taking the next pitch out to left field. The back-to- back home runs made it 10-1 after four innings.
 “It means a lot,” Sydnee Deen said. “We treasure every moment.”
 Miller struck out the side in the top of the fifth inning, and Turpin scored the 'walk-off' run in the bottom of the frame on a single from Collins.
 Collins, Deen and Turpin each had two hits for Platte Valley while Miller, Maggie Collins, Pappert and Angle each had one. Platte Valley managed six extra-base hits among their 10 total hits.
 The state semifinals will be at La Plata on Tuesday as the Bulldogs beat Braymer 1-0 in nine innings on Saturday. It is the first time the team has reached the state semifinals since 2016 when the team took third.
 “The last time that the program ever went to state was my eighth-grade year,” Collins said. “This will be my first time ever going. It has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember.”
 Two more wins would give the program its first state title since the Jefferson-South Nodaway co-op began. Jefferson softball last won state in 2014.
 “Tuesday can't come soon enough,” Collins said. “I am ready.”

California is in far worse shape economically than the great majority of other states also struggling through the pandemic. COVID-19 may be the primary cause of our current distress, but the evolving structure of our economy has exacerbated this calamity. The worst part is our state leaders should have known this all along.
 In September, California’s unemployment rate was 11%, well above the national average of 7.9%, and better only than two other states in the nation. Since the March lockdown, California, with 12% of the nation’s population, accounts for 16.4% of all U.S. unemployment.
 A similar pattern can be seen in our metropolitan areas. Among the 55 largest metro areas in the country, the worst job losses from February to August — outside of Las Vegas and Boston — have occurred in the Bay Area and Los Angeles-Long Beach. By contrast, other metro areas, such as Salt Lake City; Austin, Texas; Dallas-Fort Worth; and San Antonio are doing much better.
 Over the past decade, the California economy has been divided, Janus-like, between a rising innovation economy, based largely in the Bay Area, and the rest of the state where 86% of all new jobs have paid below the median income of $66,000, and 48% are under $40,000 a year. Once a beacon of opportunity, the state suffers the highest cost-adjusted poverty rate in the country.

Attack, she did. Miller finished with a five-inning complete game and while not allowing a hit. She struck out four and walked a pair while hitting one batter.
 “I knew it was going to be tight and that I just had to hit my spots, get it right to (catcher) Maggie (Collins), and if I could do that, then we were going to get out of this ahead,” Miller said.
 The WildCards (12-12) did manage to scrape across one run without getting a hit in the third inning, but that felt like little concern for the red-hot Platte Valley offense.
 Platte Valley (21-3) started fast, literally, with Malia Collins reaching on a walk. The senior shortstop stole second and went to third on an error. She then sprinted home on a wild pitch.
 A Miller walk led to Claire Galbraith — Miller's courtesy runner — scoring on an RBI by Allie Wolf. Platte Valley led 2-0 after one inning.
 Platte Valley added two more in the second with a two-out triple by Stephanie Turpin and Collins being hit by a pitch to set the table for Paige West. West hit a sharp grounder to shortstop and ran hard out of the box. Her speed put pressure on the throw and the first baseman could not glove it.
 After Stewartsville/Osborn got its run in the third, Platte Valley began teeing off in the fourth inning. Jackie Pappert singled to lead off the inning and Brylie Angle plated her with a triple. Turpin came up with her second extra-base knock of the day — a double to make it 6-1.
 “I knew that see was a good pitcher and if I could watch her pitches, she was going to give me one to hit,” Turpin said. “We all waited, had our weight back and were ready to hit it hard.”

Blies, skippered by Jake Haggerty and fielding a new formation, made a bright start and Jack Drew-Cull was denied the opening goal by a smart save from the Feniton glovesman.
 Feniton hit back, but they got little change out of the impressive defensive trio of Reece Alexander, Ashton Beck and Haydon Simpson.
 The first half saw one particularly slick Blues move with skipper Haggerty, Ashton Beck and Ethan Hawes all involved prior to Luke Paramore seeing his effort well saved.
 After a goalless first half, the Blues management tweaked the tactics and made a number of positional changes for the second half.
 The switching around of things paid dividends for, 13 minutes into the half. Adam Watts got onto the end of a Haggerty free-kick to fire Blues into the lead.
 Again, Feniton looked to respond, and they certainly carried a threat, but once again they were unable to get the better of the Blues’ back line who were disciplined with their defending.
 At the other end of the pitch, Alexander and Oscar Grunt combined for Oliver Bradley to get a shot away that was well saved, but the second goal did eventually come.
 Haydon Simpson delivered a fine corner that Drew-Cull met with his head. The ball was cleared, but only as far as Watts on the edge of the area and he drilled it through a crowd of legs to make it 2-0.
 Two became three when Makan Coulibaly provided the ‘assist’ for Paramore to net.
 The final goal came from another set-piece with a Bradley corner headed home by Paramore.
 The Blues’ Man of the Match award was shared between Adam Watts and Oscar Grint.
 A special mention also to Gary Ayley, father of Blues’ player Lewis Ayley who is currently out injured.
 Ayley senior made the trip from Okehampton to run the line for Blues and that act of selflessness was really appreciated by all connected to the Blues Under-16s.

 Castori ha poi espresso la propria felicità per non aver preso goal sottolineando che “la fase difensiva è stata fatta bene“. Il tecnico ha inoltre ribadito quanto già evidente a tutti gli spettatori: “E’ stata una partita difficile, siamo stati anche sfortunati. Abbiamo meritato la vittoria“.

Gentrification.
 It happens all the time. But this time it was personal. I knew the old guy who was displaced, and the worst part was that I was to blame.
 He had lived close by for about three years. Quiet, downright aloof at times, he wasn’t an easy fellow to get to know. But since COVID-19 and the isolation it brought, I was home and spending a good bit of time outside. We saw each other daily and developed a camaraderie. He’d stop whatever he was doing if he saw me, nod cautiously in my direction, puff his dewlap into a bright orange bubble and go on about his business.
 If you are confused at this point, I guess I should mention that I’m talking about No-Tail, the brown anole who has been a presence in our patio garden for three summers.
 The last time I saw him was the morning before gentrification began. He was enjoying a romantic tryst on the fence with a young female. I recognized him immediately. He has a vertical stub for a tail, and his skin appears to be in a perpetual state of molting. The rendezvous complete, he caught a huge earthworm and devoured it for breakfast.
 “Not a bad way to start the day,” my husband commented.
 Early the next morning, I began work on his garden territory, which had that exhausted, end-of-summer appearance. I cleared leaf debris and moldy mulch from the beds and cut back the aphid-covered night blooming jasmine. I removed impatiens laced by slugs and snails, cleaned the fountain, leveled and shimmed the listing garden gargoyle — No-Tail’s favorite place to sun himself — and yanked out unwanted, overgrown asparagus fern.
 After sweeping and washing the patio bricks, the area looked neat but bare … of plants and lizards.
 Installation of fresh annuals would have to wait until cooler, or at least less hot, days arrived. The lizards, I assumed, would return by late afternoon, and they did. All but one.
 The revered patriarch was still absent the following day, and a veritable turf-war had begun in the garden. No longer in danger of being snared in the jaws of the master hunter, juvenile lizards scurried about freely, snapping at moths and each other. Several hipster and millennial males engaged in a bidding war for ownership of No-Tail’s prime sunning spot on the gargoyle’s left wing. A lonely female kept watch on the fence, longing for his return.
 I never thought I’d write a tribute to a lizard, but these are unusual times.
 I hope No-Tail is alive and well, perhaps in the compost bin with his discarded garden debris. I imagine him living the good life there, a gated retirement community for aging lizards. I feel sure he’ll meet some attractive senior ladies who hunger for his advances and serve him tasty meals of grubs and worms that they have prepared especially for him.
 Wherever you are, “stay gold,” No-Tail. You are one kick-ass lizard.

 the Bulldogs not only had to battle against the Cadets on the field; they had to battle themselves. The team lost that fight, too.
 "It wasn't just fumbles. it was missed blocks. it was missed communication. It was penalties. Any time we started getting momentum, we decided to shoot ourselves in the foot and we just couldn't finish a drive," Olson said.
 One of those missed chances came early in the fourth quarter. Monrovia worked their way into the red zone, facing a third-and-four situation on the Cadets' nine. The offense fumbled the ball and Cascade recovered. The Cadets went on to score the game's only touchdown on that drive with 6:26 remaining in the game.

And he said, 'Well, we've signed the contract; we should play. You'll get me in trouble if we don't play.' So I decided to play, but what I did was we played 'Song For Che' [at] the concert, and before we played it, I dedicated it to the Black Liberation Movement in Mozambique, Angola and Guinea-Bissau. [It] was in a hockey stadium in Casegas, outside of Lisbon, and there were 20,000 people there, most of whom were young students and were ready to hear something like that. They started chanting, and all hell broke loose as soon as I made the dedication, and police were running around with machine guns trying to get order.

Netback is a non-GAAP measure commonly used in the oil and gas industry to assist in measuring operating performance on a per-unit basis. Cenovus's and Husky's netback calculation is aligned with the definition found in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook ('COGE Handbook'). Netbacks reflect the margin of Cenovus on a per-barrel of oil equivalent basis. Netback is defined as gross sales less royalties, transportation and blending, operating expenses and production and mineral taxes divided by sales volumes. Netbacks do not reflect non-cash write-downs or reversals of product inventory until it is realized when the product is sold. The sales price, transportation and blending costs, and sales volumes exclude the impact of purchased condensate. Condensate is blended with the heavy oil to transport it to market.
