CAPE TOWN - Parliament has given the green light to the supplementary budget tabled by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni in June.
 The Adjustments Appropriation Bill was approved without any amendments by the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) following a marathon session on Tuesday. It was passed by the National Assembly on 29 July.
 The Bill is a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its social and economic fallout.
 NCOP chairperson Amos Masondo announced the outcome of the vote “In favour, 26. Against, 23. Abstentions – none. The majority having voted in favour, the Bill is therefore agreed to in terms of Section 75 of the Constitution.”
 The Adjustments Appropriations Bill provides for the allocation of money from the National Revenue Fund. As amended, it allows for finance minister Tito Mboweni to approve urgent expenditure for contingency funding before October.
 That is when he will deliver his Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) and table a second Adjustments Appropriation Bill.
 The Bill will now be sent to President Cyril Ramaphosa for him to sign it into law.
 Parliament is in recess until 17 August.

With the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the state, Washington County school districts have set mask policies for students and staff amid some uncertainty about whether changes might be needed over the next couple of weeks before classes start.
   
 "As one superintendent told me, this could change in 30 seconds," said Steven Cantrell, superintendent for Caney Valley Schools.
   
 Three of four Washington County public school districts are mandating that staff and all but the youngest students wear masks to protect them and others from COVID-19.
   
 Both Bartlesville and Copan schools will require that students from sixth to 12th grade wear face coverings, while Caney Valley Public Schools just decided to mandate masks for children from fourth grade and above.
   
 Dewey schools will not require masks for students, and school staff will be required only to wear a face covering when physical distancing isn't feasible.
   
 "We highly recommend and expect students to have one with them each day to put on when physical distancing cannot be achieved," Superintendent Vince Vincent said.
   
 In a recent 4-3 vote, the state Board of Education decided to make wearing masks in schools in "high-risk" counties a recommendation rather than a requirement. The majority said that the decision about wearing masks should be left up to local school officials.
   
 After the board vote, State Superintendent Joy Hofmeister expressed disappointment.
   
 "Today's vote is … one that likely will stoke more concerns for teachers, parents and families with a new school year only weeks away," she said in a statement. "We all realize how important it is for schools to reopen. But we are in the midst of a global pandemic with COVID-19 cases sharply rising in our state."
   
 She said believed it appropriate for the board to establish a floor of recommended and required protocols to ensure a safer environment for all in the school community. But now that the decision is made, Hofmeister urged districts to do the right thing by masking up and following social distancing guidelines.
   
 Hofmeister also pledged to make sure school districts statewide get the personal protective equipment they need.
   
 Last Thursday, Gov. Kevin Stitt announced he will commit $10 million from the state's share of federal CARES Act funding to provide protective gear, such as masks, to Oklahoma schools.
   
 "Our kids cannot miss another year of school," Stitt said during the news conference announcing the personal protective equipment allocation.
   
 Meanwhile, school administrators throughout Washington County have been diligent in making the right decision for their district, consulting local and state health officials as well as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Many, if not all, have received donations from local businesses and other organizations to purchase masks and other protective gear.
   
 "We are very thankful to have received a $10,000 grant from the Cherokee Nation and a $5,000 grant from Phillips 66 to help with COVID-19-related expenses," Vincent said.
   
 The Dewey district has ordered gaiters for all students and staff members, two cloth masks per staff member and face shields for many staffers.
   
 Vincent expects to receive around $193,000 dollars through the CARES Act to help with larger expenses incurred in preparation for the school year.
   
 Like other districts, Bartlesville Public Schools worked on crafting safety protocols for the coronavirus in the spring and throughout the summer. After unveiling the plan online, officials held two community meetings at Custer Stadium in June for parents to learn details about the plan.
   
 "We're trying our best to have in-person school, but we're going to have a lot of interruptions and quarantines," Superintendent Chuck McCauley told parents and guardians. "It's very challenging."
   
 BPS has received donations from many community organizations, including ConocoPhillips and Arvest Bank.
   
 The district also received an $8 million competitive grant from the Oklahoma State Department of Education Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund and another $8 million from the Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund.
   
 McCauley told those at one of the community meetings that they should expect interruptions and abrupt changes as the school year goes along.
   
 "It will be very challenging. Teachers will need to be able to switch from in- class to virtual school on a dime," he said. "But we know kids need to be in school."

Rugby Australia chairman Hamish McLennan said Kearns had an "impeccable international reputation" and would use his extensive contacts throughout the game to boost Australia's bid.
 "As part of his role, Phil will spend time overseas to be a key contact with the World Rugby member unions, to showcase our bid and to highlight why we would be a tremendous host in 2027," McLennan said.
 Australia jointly held the inaugural World Cup in 1987 with New Zealand, and took sole hosting duties in 2003.
 It is considered the front runner for 2027.
 Argentina pulled out of the running earlier this year and the only other country to publicly express interest is Russia, although - with France hosting in 2023 - there would probably be resistance to holding back-to-back tournaments in Europe.
 World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper has also canvassed the prospect of the United States launching a bid, despite USA Rugby filing for bankruptcy earlier this year.

The former has found itself a place in the top five highest-selling motorcycles in UK's middleweight segment for the past one year. Meanwhile, the Interceptor 650 has outdone all the competition and placed itself in the top spot in the same category over the past one year. The icing on the cake is that the Interceptor 650 has earned an additional accolade in the form of 'best-selling motorcycle in the UK for June 2020 in the 125 cc-plus category'.

Benji Marshall is sure he wouldn't have returned to the NRL from that horrific injury Chris Lawrence suffered but he knew his Wests Tigers teammate could.
 At the start of 2019 Lawrence was left unrecognisable when his face was shattered in a freak training accident in New Zealand, leaving surgeons to piece it together like a jigsaw puzzle.
 The Tigers veteran needed seven plates in his face but was given the final tick of approval by doctors to return to the field midway through last year.
 Marshall called it the worst thing he has ever seen in rugby league.
 "I don't think I would have come back from that, no," he said on Wednesday.
 "Because it's Chris I knew he could come back, just the way he goes into tackles with no fear.
 "Honestly, it was the worst thing I've seen in rugby league, that injury, so it's a credit to him.
 "I know it's just words when you talk about toughness and resilience but if you were there and you saw it and you could feel it, it's really painful.
 "But the way he's come back from it, that's Chris."
 The pride and history between the two club veterans is evident as they prepare for their 250th NRL games for their beloved club on Saturday.
 Although Marshall's career took him to rugby union, Brisbane and St George Illawarra before settling back with the Tigers, Lawrence is a one-club man.
 Marshall was sidelined for Lawrence's NRL debut in 2006 but he remembers watching the teenager with a 'Justin Bieber' haircut race down the sideline to score and thinking he was a star in the making.
 "Just seeing him grow from that kid doing his HSC to now one of our main leaders and the heart and soul of this club, it's very special for him," Marshall said.
 It's equally as humbling for Lawrence to achieve the milestone alongside Marshall, with both players tied on 84 tries - a record for the Tigers.
 "Considering some of the injuries and setbacks I've been through, there was a point in time last year when I thought I'd played my last game," he said.
 "(Benji is) going to go down as one of the best players in the game and a guy who changed the way the game has played, so I'm very proud to be doing it with him."

“The support that A&B is providing to Hale Mahaolu’s rental assistance program is of huge significance to our tenants, particularly those who reside at our family housing sites and work in businesses which are tourism oriented. Many of these families’ breadwinners have been furloughed or laid off from their jobs, thus creating a great deal of pressure on them to make ends meet for their families,” said Grant Chun, Executive Director, Hale Mahaolu.
 “The infusion of funds into this program by A&B comes at just the right moment, when the funds that we have previously allocated to the program are close to being depleted. Further, against the backdrop of unemployment benefits being reduced over time, the assistance which A&B’s contribution represents is made all that much more meaningful and significant to our residents,” said Chun.
 The remainder of the COVID-19 designated funds will be distributed later this year to address an anticipated increase in pandemic-related needs.
 Carol Reimann, A&B’s Maui vice president said, “2020 marks our company’s 150th anniversary year. While we have paused our plans to commemorate this milestone with employee service projects on Maui, we are proud to continue recognizing our long-time partners delivering important programs and services to local residents in need.”
 Ching called it a very challenging period for Hawaiʻi and the world saying, "Fortunately, however, Hawaiʻi is a different place with a culture like nowhere else—one of mutual respect, sharing and support amongst a population marked by diversity. A&B is proud to work side-by-side with our community partners to try to make a difference, one life at a time. We invite you to take a look at our latest Review of Giving, outlining A&B’s partnerships in the past year. While 2020 giving is taking a different course due to the unanticipated impacts of COVID-19, we remain committed to the community non- profits who work year after year, in good times and bad, to make Hawaiʻi a better place for all.”

Two weeks ago the Harrisonburg School Board agreed that the school division should pivot the fall semester to online-only learning for most students, as opposed to the blended learning that had originally been approved, in light of new research.
 During a meeting Tuesday, School Board members got a better idea of what that will look like exactly. An extensive presentation of virtual learning, as well as how the arts will be offered, was given by Superintendent Michael Richards for the board’s approval at a subsequent meeting.
 While most students will be learning online exclusively this coming fall, according to the proposed plan, a small number of vulnerable students, such as English language learners and students with disabilities, will be invited to participate in in-person learning four days a week.

Increasing factors mainly included ¥16,128 million in increase in short-term borrowings and commercial papers and ¥99,180 million in proceeds from long-term borrowings. Regarding proceeds from long- term borrowings, this was because financing was carried out through long-term borrowings in order to secure on-hand liquidity in light of the impact of COVID-19 on business results.
