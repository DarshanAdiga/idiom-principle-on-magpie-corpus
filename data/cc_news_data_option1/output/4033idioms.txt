The Baahubali actor said that he has known Miheeka all his life, but they took the decision to tie the knot during the lockdown. "I know her for a very long time because my sister and hers went to school together. So, I’ve known her pretty much all my life and there’s only a handful of people who move from Hyderabad to Bombay. So, we got talking during the lockdown and I said okay, this is right and that’s about it. So, when good things happen, I don’t question too much, I just go. Everyone’s got a timeline, it’s okay.

Pentru ca fondurile să ajungă, încă de anul trecut mâncarea caldă a fost oferită iniţial elevilor din clasele primare şi preşcolarilor. În total - peste 100 de copii hrăniţi zilnic. Pachetul alimentar cald costă 10 de lei de copil şi conţine în general un meniu echilibrat cu carne, legume, dar şi desert.
   
 Banii pentru mâncarea copiilor sunt asiguraţi din bugetul local. Mai precis, autorităţile locale spun că de mai bine de doi ani au renunţat la toate festivităţile, inclusiv zilele comunei, pentru economii. Iar toate aceste fonduri au fost direcţionate pentru masa copiilor.
   
 ”Noi nu mai făceam zilele comunei. Şi nici alte chestiuni inutile. Am direcţionat fonduri către un dispensar, către şcoli, inclusiv această masă caldă. Ne-am dat seama că din bugetul local, făcând economie, puteam asigura hrană şi pentru ciclul gimnazial”, spune edilul.
   
 De altfel au început demersurile pentru ca şi ceilalţi 150 de elevi, de clasele V-VIII să primească masă caldă la şcoală. ”Orice primărie ar putea face lucrul acesta. Ar ajuta ca măcar la şcoală aceşti copii, şi vorbesc în special de cazurile sociale, să fie sătui. Depinde de drămuirea banului”, adaugă Eugen Nechita.

Rep. Anthony Brindisi has opened a 9-point lead over Claudia Tenney entering the final weeks of one of the most closely watched House races in the nation, according to a Siena College | Syracuse.com poll released today.
 Brindisi, D-Utica, leads Tenney, R-New Hartford, 48-39% among likely voters in an eight-county district that covers parts of Central New York, the Mohawk Valley and Southern Tier.
 A third-party candidate on the ballot, Libertarian Keith Price, is favored by 4% of likely voters. About 9% are undecided. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
 The results mark a dramatic shift from the 2018 election when Brindisi unseated Tenney by fewer than 2 percentage points in one of the most competitive congressional contests nationwide.
 The poll shows Brindisi managed to open his biggest lead to date over Tenney on the strength of his popularity with voters, Trump’s sinking support in a district he once dominated, and an increasingly negative view that voters hold of Tenney.
 In three separate Siena polls in 2018, Brindisi and Tenney were in a dead heat in a Republican-leaning district that President Donald Trump won by 15 percentage points in 2016.

Edilul din Drăguşeni, Eugen Nechita, spune că în urmă cu aproximativ un an a făcut o anchetă socială în comună pentru a vedea în general situaţia economică a localnicilor.
   
 Rezultatele l-au pus pe gânduri.
   
 Primarul a ajuns la concluzia că mulţi copii merg flămânzi la şcoală. Alţii mănâncă nesănătos, ce apucă, pufuleţi sau chips-uri. Atunci s-a gândit să iniţieze un proiect prin care, măcar la şcoală, să le ofere o masă consistentă, aproape zilnic.
   
 ”Noi am pornit acest proiect după o serie de vizite cu asistenţa socială, dar şi cu asistentul comunitar prin comună, pe la oameni. Ne-am dat seama că este necesar să-i ajutăm pe copii, pentru că nu toţi au posibilităţi. Sunt mulţi care lucrează în agricultură, au mulţi copii, puţine surse de venit sau chiar deloc. Era dramatic şi am zis că trebuie să facem ceva. Am pus cap la cap lucrurile şi analizând în Consiliul Local, împreună cu profesorii am decis să oferim, la şcoală, copiilor o masă caldă. Ceva consistent care să le alunge foamea şi să-i ajute să se concentreze la ore”, spune primarul Eugen Nechita. Mâncarea caldă urma să fie adusă de la o firmă de catering dintr-o zonă apropiată, pentru a se menţine caldă.

MARSHFIELD - The 2019 Marshfield High girls soccer team made a decent run to get into the postseason, only to be ousted after a tight competitive, game, 2-0 by Bishop Feehan. The Rams' disappointment at that loss was assuaged a bit when the Shamrocks (23-0-1) went on to win the Division 1 state championship.
 But there won't be much chance of building off the pride of a close battle with the state champs, because the bulk of that 2019 team's core graduated. How much soccer talent that 2019 class contained might be seen by noting that players from that group now play for the University of Rhode Island, University of Massachusetts, Bryant University, and Salve Regina.
 It's not like the cupboard is bare but the 2020 Rams will have a few veterans, and many more players either joining varsity for the first time, or seeing their first substantial minutes at the top level. Coach Dominic Centorino welcomed a stunning 71 candidates to the opening of practice this fall, so the varsity, JVs and freshman teams will all be fully stocked. And the Patriot League 'bubble' schedule is a bit unusual, in a good way for a young team, as five of the Rams' first six games are at home. They started the season Friday with a 6-0 loss to Hingham.
 "We lost a really strong senior core to graduation," said Centorino. "I would say at least three of them were just stellar athletes, the kind that are very hard to replace. This year's team is going to have to have a whole new identity of its own. We have some carryover, in returning players, but the new rules and everything make it all initially a bit overwhelming. I think our starting later this year has all the girls itching to get out there and play soccer, but it also leaves us a little behind on team bonding. Ultimately this season will be about the girls having fun, and bonding with their teammates, and we're just hoping to emphasize that, while playing good, competitive soccer."
 Marshfield has a couple of veteran captains in seniors Sam McGregor and Julie Alcaro, and the latter has a real desire to get back into action. Alcaro tore up her knee and missed all of her junior season.
 "They are a good pair of players to build around, and they are helping the other girls learn what it takes," said Centorino. "We kept as many players as we could this fall, so we have 29 players on our varsity team, and it is very senior-heavy, with 15 seniors. So I think that class will play a big role here, and Sam and Julie are excellent leaders."
 A couple of other veterans will play major roles for the new-look Rams, in juniors Riley Drosopoulos, a defender, and Bridgette Barrowman, an offensive- minded midfielder.
 "Riley is an outstanding back and we're lucky to have her," said Centorino, "while Bridgette is a junior who's basically been a starter since her freshman year. Those are two really important cogs for us."
 Marshfield High's reboot had to begin in net, where the 2019 team had standout netminder Kate McNeill.
 "We'll have senior Stella Scholfield and sophomore Sydney Sheehan playing goalkeeper for us," said Centorino. "They have both looked good so far. We also have a freshman goalie playing on the JVs - it's always good to have a couple goalies in the system, and after graduating Kate we had to replenish that position."
 Some other key performers come from all the classes.
 "We're looking for a big season from senior Laney Zaslaw, who scored a hat trick against Cohasset last year," noted Centorino. "And Laney has her kid sister, sophomore Sammy Zaslaw, a midfielder also on the team. We have two sets of sisters, with Sam McGregor's sophomore sister Maddie, a defender and midfielder, joining us, so that's always a good thing."
 "Mya D'Antonio is another young player with lots of potential, a sophomore forward who came up as a freshman last year," said Centorino. "And then we have junior Nadia Kiziuk, a very skilled midfielder. Sydney McCabe is another fine midfielder player, a junior, as is forward Sara Weijkus, and they've done well."
 "A couple of seniors we're looking to are forward Celine LeDoux and midfielder Gwyn O'Sullivan, and they are certainly in the mix too," said Centorino.
 When you get to the more specific roles, it isn't quite as clear who might emerge as the Rams scoring threats.
 "Last year we shared the wealth, and no one person scored a lot of goals," said Centorino. "I suspect it may be that way again. We have a lot of forwards this year, and we'll try and rotate them all in. One thing that helps there is the quarters format, instead of just playing halves like we did before. Four periods will help break it up and help us manage everyone's minutes better."
 The new pandemic MIAA rules changes are also likely to boost offense. There are no throw-ins but rather kick-ins, no heading the ball, no slide tackles, and minimal shoulder to shoulder contact allowed. Most observers would suggest it will make playing defense even more difficult.
 "We are expecting there will be penalties and a lot of indirect kicks for contact fouls," said Centorino. "And with teams unable to form defensive walls, those set plays become even more important. I think we are expecting a big season from Julie Alcaro, who has been itching to play for over a year, and did a lot of work to recover from her knee injury. We also expect to get some scoring from Bridgette Barrowman out of the midfield, as well as Laney Zaslaw, and Syndey McCabe."
 The Rams have studied the new rules and played two pre-season scrimmages, with referees to help them adjust.
 "Initially we all had some officials do a Zoom meeting to explain the new rules, and how they would be interpreted," Centorino explained. "My first impression was that this could be a high-scoring season for everyone, and from what we've seen it will be, but not absurdly so. I also believe the boys game is much more physical and faster than our game, so it may not be as big an adjustment for us. The silver lining, for us coaches, is that the key to playing with this new rulebook is stressing possession. We have to be more deliberate and patient with how we progress the ball down the field. And those direct free kicks with no wall will be big plays."
 "Our defenders have had two scrimmages with game officials to help us adjust," Centorino added. "The officials we had took the time to explain the calls they made, and those scrimmages - against Pembroke and Silver Lake - really helped us. If you kick the ball in the air, for example, it's a re-start. We have to play within the confines of the new rules, and find a way to be successful. But none of us wants a whistle every two minutes, or to ruin the flow of the game. We are hoping for consistency in enforcing the rules, and we know the officials' job is hard. But the main goal, is for everyone involved to have some fun playing soccer, and hopefully developing their skills, while enjoying all the social and emotional benefits of being part of a team"
 After the Rams' opening game, the state lifted restrictions on crowd sizes, so they anticipate being able to have up to 250 fans for each remaining home game. All the players and coaches were anxious to get going, and they have had to basically shrug off any misgivings about getting a late start and a compressed season. But once again, Marshfield becoming a full-fledged member of the Patriot League this fall has eased the way, and provided a competitive 11-game season.
 "There was a time we didn't know if this season would happen," Centorino admitted. "Finally they gave us a date and a structure, and we got to work. We do miss having more pre-season time, but we have 11 girls who play year-round, which helps. Every other team is in the same boat as far as limited practice, and I think we miss the opportunity for team bonding most of all. I have to give Bill Battis, our athletic director, a lot of thanks for all he's done, because he's been awesome, and brings so much credibility to our program. Our tryouts went well, the team looks good so far, and everyone is in agreement - it's great to be back."

Rising glamsters Starbenders have released another single and video from their _Love Potions_ album. _Can't Cheat Time_ follows _Something Ain't Right_, _Cover Me_ __ and _Push_ _,_ and is, like the others, a triumph.
 As usual the Atlanta quartet have hoisted another giant chorus from their apparently bottomless well of melodic source material, but this time there's a distinct whiff of something very British about the arrangement. We'll let frontwoman Kimi Shelter explain.
 " _Can't Cheat Time_ is a personal favourite amongst the band," she says. "This single has a wicked string arrangement reminiscent of Jeff Lynne from ELO's production style. It was so rewarding hearing all of it come together with the live string players.
 "The accompanying music video is a love letter to the mom and pop businesses that have shaped and supported our very existence. These businesses along with the touring industry have been devastated by the pandemic. We filmed in locations around Atlanta which include the local greasy spoon diner, the record shop, the independent guitar store, the watering hole and the divey small music venue."
 Shelter goes on to say that while mega-retailers remained open during lockdown, 60% of small businesses forced to close their doors may never reopen.
 "These places are vital to the social and economic health of our cities," she adds. "We encourage our friends to go to Save Our Stages and sign up to push legislators to help independent venues though the updated Heroes Act.
 "So many are hurting and on the verge of financial ruin from lighting to sound engineers, musicians, DJs, security, bar staff and venue operators. Our hearts are with you all."
 The band have also released an acoustic version of _Can't Cheat Time_ , which retains the string arrangement and rattles along very nicely. We suggest you listen to both.

In tempi di coronavirus il furto era intelligente e remunerativo: i monitor di pc risolvono la vita quando si è costretti a lavorare su piccoli schermi dei portatili. Ma i ladri non hanno fatto in tempo a piazzarli, sono stati preceduti dai carabinieri del nucleo Radiomobile della compagnia di Cassano d'Adda che hanno trovato il prezioso bottino in un furgone parcheggiato in una zona sterrata, lungo la Cassenese. Il camioncino era in punto insolito, quasi senza senso. A insospettire i militari anche il filo di ferro utilizzato per chiudere il portellone, dietro il quale, sorpresa, erano stipati 168 monitor per computer del valore di oltre 35mila euro. I carabinieri hanno subito contattato il proprietario del mezzo che in quel momento non sapeva di aver subito il furto. Nessuna traccia dei ladri ma la refurtiva è stata recuperata completamente, per la gioia della ditta di Cavenago di Brianza cui hanno sottratto la merce e del proprietario del furgone rubato a Trezzano sul Naviglio.   Secondo quanto ricostruito, i ladri hanno approfittato di una pausa del conducente di un autoarticolato che aveva parcheggiato a Cavenago per svuotargli il container pieno di schermi, poi trasferiti sul furgone preso a Trezzano. Gli autori sarebbero tornati a breve per ritirare il carico...) ma sono stati anticipati dai carabinieri. (S.Gar.)

“That’s the same with all those young players.”
 Indeed, two of WVU’s top three backup defensive linemen weren’t even with the program last season, and their development was hampered by the lack of preseason work opportunities.
 Still, Lesley believes each has a bright future.
 West Virginia defensive lineman Akheem Mesidor gets the first sack of his career against Eastern Kentucky
 “Akheem Mesidor (6-2, 268 lbs., Fr.) has a chance down the road to be a really good player,” noted West Virginia’s defensive line coach. “Quay Mays is starting to come around. Once again, he would have had the spring and summer but did not. He would have gotten those 15 practices in the spring at a speed that is different than junior college. He would have gotten all of those as well as a spring game at game-typo instead of practice tempo. He would be further ahead, but he’s coming along. So is Jalen Thornton (6-2, 265 lbs., RFr.). He’s done some good things so far.
 “Those are guys we have to depend on,” continued Lesley. “We can’t go through the season saying Darius and Dante are going to do everything, because they’re not. We have to have guys who will continue to develop, continue to improve and continue to step up.”
 Mesidor in particular is a young lineman who seems to be progressing rapidly.
 “Mesidor has played probably as much as any freshman in our program,” said Brown of the first-year player who is a native Ottawa, Canada. “He’s explosive and loves football. He doesn’t just like football, he loves it. He loves to compete, and he loves to practice. He’s hungry to learn.
 “We’ve been playing him more on the edge lately, which is where he’s played in the past, and he’s playing well,” added Brown.
 As a whole, Lesley believes his defensive line still has plenty of room for overall improvement.
 “We’ve played hard, but we can play harder,” the 2007 Troy University grad said. “The one thing that is still lacking is execution in key situations, which is ultimately on me.
 “You just have to coach them better to get what you’re trying to do across to them,” he added. “If you believe what you’re trying to do works — which I firmly believe — then you just keep working to get better.”
 While Lesley is working hard to develop quality depth in his d-line, certainly the play of the top three on the depth chart is a huge key. Pooler is a consistent force, though the Stills brothers are the first two on the minds of many.
 “Every time we come to the line, (the opposing offense) is going to know where 55 (Dante) and 56 (Darius) are,” he continued. “That’s part of being a good player. They have to learn to deal with it, and the guys around them have to take that pressure off of them, which isn’t happening right now.”
