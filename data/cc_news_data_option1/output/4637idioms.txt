The questioned ballots should not impact any of the results on the local ballot, he said.
 Belding said the county is complying with all directives by the Department of State and the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the election. The county election is expected to be certified with official results on or before Nov. 23.
 Belding also said no major issues were reported at the county’s 42 voting precincts on Election Day, and commended poll workers and new county hires for “stepping up” and assisting in the election.
 “Because of their efforts, we were able to have a validated election process in Greene County,” he said.
 Voters showed up in droves at Greene County’s voting precincts Nov. 3, with long lines reported at various locations throughout the day and many voters reportedly having to wait in line for more than an hour to cast their ballots.
 Many local voters waiting in line at their respective polling places Nov. 3 said they preferred to cast their ballots in person. One of those voters was Timm Reeves, who voted at the Carmichaels Fire Hall and waited 35 to 40 minutes in line.
 Reeves said he would have waited longer if necessary.
 “It was very important to me that I vote in person instead of mailing my ballot in,” Reeves said. “I personally believe it is something that every voter should do, if they are able. Anything could happen to mail-in ballots, whether they get lost or stolen, or even corrupted.”
 Scott McCracken of Waynesburg voted at the Franklin East polling place mid- morning, waiting nearly an hour in line. McCracken echoed others’ sentiments in that he preferred to vote in person.
 “Showing up and voting in person made me feel that my vote would be secure, and not be lost in the mail,” he said.
 Susan Tretinik of Waynesburg cast her ballot at the downtown Waynesburg Borough 2 polling place. She was pleasantly surprised that there was not a long line, and that the process was easy.
 She, too, was not comfortable with the mail-in option.
 “It’s not just this election. I feel that way about mail-ins every time I vote,” she said. “But this election is very important, and I wanted to absolutely make sure my vote is secure.”
 Rick Black of Waynesburg voted shortly after his Waynesburg Borough 1 polling place opened. He waited in line about 20 minutes and watched it grow longer by the minute, he said. Commending poll workers for their efforts, Black said it was crucial for him to vote in person.
 “This is a tremendously important election for our country, and I absolutely knew I would be voting in person,” he said. “I heard the rumors about ballot theft and fraud, and about hundreds or maybe even thousands of ballots being lost. I wasn’t going to take a chance of that happening to my ballot.”
 Bill Baxendell of Waynesburg stood in line roughly 50 minutes at the Franklin East polling place.
 “I would rather wait in line for hours here in person than mail in my ballot,” he said. “I want to be in control of my vote, and doing this in person means I can control it.”

 "He told me that because I had my pay date set up for every Friday, but I had occasionally paid them early on a Thursday or a Wednesday, the system didn't like it and that's why I had received the summons.
 "As it's been a tough year, I'd been paying it as soon as I had the funds to make sure it was paid, so I was just shocked that I had received this summons."
 Tracie says she worries it is causing unnecessary stress in what has already been a tough year.
 She said: "This year has been all over the place and knowing what day it is can be a struggling in itself.
 "But it must have seriously offended their system to warrant being taken to court, especially during the pandemic when everyone is struggling."

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - While the University of Memphis has not announced its full basketball schedule, men’s head coach Penny Hardaway said all that’s left is finalizing contracts. Hardaway confirmed the Tigers still plan on playing in the Crossover Classic in South Dakota. Memphis was originally set to open the season there on November 25 against Ohio State, but the Buckeyes dropped out of the field due the South Dakota’s high positivity rate which would’ve forced them to quarantine 14 days after their return. Instead, Memphis will take on Saint Mary’s of the West Coast Conference in Game One. “We feel like they replaced them with some pretty good teams,” said Penny. “It was kind of a blow to lose Duke, Ohio State and Dayton, but you get some good teams coming in. Saint Mary’s, Utah State, South Dakota State. It’s not the same tournament, but at the beginning of the season that’s a great tournament to start in.” &nbsp; Hardaway said the Tigers are healthy. Big Man Isaiah Stokes, the Florida transfer from Lausanne, is the only one who hasn’t been at practice. Hardaway said he has personal things to address but expects to get him back this week.Copyright 2020 WMC. All rights reserved.

 The second vexing approach is blind outrage.

“Can we write Anonymous a thank you note?” asked Chairman Joe Lentini.
 “Yes, we can do that,” replied Superintendent Kevin Richard. “It’s a very kind gesture by whoever made the donation. We certainly appreciate it.”
 “It was a fabulous surprise,” DellaValla said by phone Thursday.
 She said the grant came from some local people who don’t want their names to be made public.
 “This came out of the blue this summer, and I really wasn’t as prepared as I would have liked. I just shared what my dream is and how we want to connect community resources and get the technology we need.”
 She added: “The donors want no recognition. They only want us to continue to do good work and help families. In their letter, they said they believe in my vision and recognize all the good we do.”
 The mission of Project SUCCEED (Schools Under Contract Creating Enriching Extended Days) “is to help give youth the skills and opportunities they need to be successful academically, socially and emotionally in a safe and supervised environment,”according to its website.
 “Program offerings include safe and supervised activities for students through morning supervision, homework assistance, computer lab, enrichment programs, Tin Mountain Conservation Center and many more exciting activities.”
 But with the pandemic, school staff that normally would have filled many of the roles for Project SUCCEED are doing other things. That resulted in a delayed start for the programs at Conway Elementary and John H. Fuller Elementary in North Conway, while Pine Tree School in Center Conway has been running for more than a month.
 “Due to the pandemic, we had to more than double staff and we want to keep kids and our adults safe," said DellaValla. Given the shortage of people, she reached out to the Sun last month, and it worked.
 “The paper was a huge help,” she said. “We had over 35 people come forward. We’re really getting top-tier people.”
 On Monday, the school board unanimously approved the hire of Daiyana Opio as site coordinator and Ryan Jean as enrichment instructor at Conway Elementary, and Margaret Richard and Molly Ricker as enrichment instructors at John Fuller.
 “I don’t want to jinx anything, but, hopefully, as of Tuesday, I believe we will be at full strength,” DellaValla said.

President-elect Joe Biden has a lot of repair work to do on America, much of which will be difficult, if not impossible, if Senate Republicans are bent on obstructing him. There’s one area, though, where he could unravel a lot of Trump administration damage fairly quickly and easily: Biden can bring science back to Washington.
 President Trump has done the country’s health and welfare a tremendous disservice by insulting and undermining scientists and the work they do. And he’s done it in a particularly pernicious way by sometimes embracing good science, sometimes championing bad science and sometimes rejecting scientific facts altogether. He’s switched his stances even on the same topics. Mask on, mask off? Are vaccines dangerous or lifesaving this week?
 He spent inordinate amounts of time touting a particular drug to treat COVID-19 based on one poorly conducted study, then pushed for special dispensation to use it. The drug, hydroxychloroquine, has repeatedly proved ineffective in well-conducted trials.
 But this is small potatoes compared with how Trump has debilitated important agencies in charge of guarding our health and safety. Hundreds of scientists and researchers have fled the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Agriculture during this administration after seeing policies based on sound science reversed, weakened, tinkered with, ignored and derided. So many researchers left the USDA’s economic research arm when Trump moved the entire operation to the Kansas City area that ranchers couldn’t get crucial information from the agency.

 So far, the county has not seen an uptick in deaths corresponding to the surge. In fact, as of Nov. 2, the average number of deaths per day in the county was 10, which “is the lowest number that we have seen since the very early days of the pandemic,” Ferrer said.
 Still, she emphasized, “It’s going to take all of us to avoid increased heartbreak.”

"If you put one of us in charge, we're a lot more apt to make sure things are funded and run … with a culturally competent campaign," said Rocha, whose Nuestro PAC is raising money to improve Hispanic turnout for Democrats.
 The assumption was that Latino voters were immediately turned off by Donald Trump's harsh words about Mexicans and remained angry about his focus on illegal immigration. And millions no doubt did.
 But as with Sanders, the populism that Trump injected into the GOP might have won over some Latinos. Rocha said his polling indicated that many Latino voters, particularly men, are receptive to a candidate who pledges to battle a "rigged system" so that they and their families get a fair shake.
 That's an important note for Republicans. If they're going to build on Trump's relative success, they must abandon the hope that just fixing their immigration rhetoric and policies will be enough. Latinos, like all voters, want to hear about policies that will improve their lives.
 And because the demographic is so young -- the average age of a U.S. Latino is 27, Rocha noted -- voters want to hear about education and economic opportunity. Immigration may be a threshold issue for many, but if Trump's performance proved anything, it's that it's not the deciding factor for such voters.
 That youth will drive Texas' future. Rocha pointed to the fact that 69% of Texas schoolchildren are nonwhite, and in the Fort Worth district, the percentage is even higher.
 There's also significant diversity among Latinos, and smart campaigns capitalize on that. Republicans had success targeting Cuban Americans and those of Venezuelan descent in Florida with messages about the dangers of socialism. Within Texas, Mexican Americans in big cities have a much different perspective from those in the Valley.
 Rocha says that if Democrats can reach Hispanic voters better, Texas could be blue in four or six years. Republicans now have a map to make serious in- roads.
 The battle for the future of Texas is on.

With coronavirus infections continuing to surge in California ahead of Thanksgiving, public health officials urged those who travel during the holiday to quarantine for 14 days and said more drastic restrictions could be necessary if case rates continue to rise.
 The urgent warnings come after economic reopenings were rolled back in some parts of the state and it became clear that hard-hit places such as Los Angeles County would not see their restrictions eased for the foreseeable future amid the widespread COVID-19 pandemic.
 After declining earlier in the fall, California’s weekly cases have doubled in the past month. The Golden State is now averaging about 6,300 new cases a day over the past week, up from about 3,200 a month ago, according to a Times analysis. COVID-19 hospitalizations have risen 50% in the last month, and the coronavirus positive test rate has climbed by nearly 70%, with 4.4% of test results coming back positive over the past week, up from 2.6% a month ago.
 The state as a whole hit 1 million confirmed cases Thursday, another grim milestone in a year full of them. In a sign of the worsening conditions, the drive-through testing site at Dodger Stadium has been flooded with people in recent days.

Morocco announced Friday that its troops have launched an operation in no man's land on the southern border of the Western Sahara to end "provocations" by the pro-independence Polisario Front.
 Rabat said its troops would "put a stop to the blockade" of trucks travelling between Moroccan-controlled areas of the disputed territory and neighbouring Mauritania, and "restore free circulation of civilian and commercial traffic."
 The Polisario Front warned on Monday that it would regard a three-decade-old ceasefire with Morocco as over if Rabat moved troops or civilians into the buffer zone.
 The Moroccan foreign ministry said it had been forced to act by the actions of Polisario fighters and the failure of its own appeals and those of the UN peacekeeping mission MINURSO.
 "The Polisario and its militias, who have infiltrated the zone since October 21, have been carrying out acts of banditry, blocking traffic and continually harassing MINURSO military observers," a ministry statement said.
 A senior ministry official contacted by AFP said that for some three weeks, around 70 armed men had been "attacking truck drivers, blocking their passage and engaging in extortion."
 Some 200 Moroccan truck drivers said on November 5 that they were stuck in difficult conditions on Mauritanian side of the desert border.
 They appealed to both Rabat and Nouakchott for help returning home after "Polisario fighters" blocked their passage.
 They urged UN peacekeepers to "play their role in protecting the buffer zone and the border crossing, which provides a gateway for work for thousands of drivers, farmers and traders."
 Western Sahara, a vast swathe of desert on Africa's Atlantic coast, is a disputed former Spanish colony.
 Rabat controls 80 percent of the territory, including its phosphate deposits and its lucrative ocean fisheries.
 The Polisario's forces are largely confined to the sparsely populated desert interior and refugee camps in neighbouring Algeria, the independence group's main foreign backer.
 \- 'Vigorous response' -
 Peacekeeping force MINURSO has patrolled a buffer zone between the two sides since a UN-brokered ceasefire took effect in 1991.
 The village of Guergerat in the far south of the Western Sahara is the last village under Moroccan control.
 Beyond it is a strip of desert where Polisario fighters have maintained a periodic presence in recent years.
 An informal trade has grown up exporting Moroccan fresh produce to the Mauritanian coastal city of Nouadhibou but to the growing anger of Rabat it has periodically fallen foul of the Polisario.
 In its statement on Monday the group, which has campaigned for independence since the last days of Spanish rule in the 1970s, warned it would "respond vigorously in self-defence and to defend its national sovereignty" in the event of any Moroccan incursion.
 "This will also mean the end of the ceasefire and the beginning of a new war across the region," the statement added.
 Morocco, which maintains that Western Sahara is an integral part of the kingdom, has offered autonomy for the territory but insists it will retain sovereignty.
 The Polisario demands a referendum on self-determination as set out in the 1991 ceasefire.
 The planned referendum has been repeatedly postponed due to disputes between Rabat and the Polisario over voter rolls and the question to be put.
 Negotiations on the territory's future involving Morocco, the Polisario, Algeria and Mauritania have been suspended for some time.

Gobert, a perennial contender for Defensive Player of the Year, averaging over 15 points and 13 rebounds the last two seasons, could be possible “kryptonite” when facing Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo. One issue is Gobert could be a one-and-done with an expiring contract.
 Aldridge is 35 and has one year remaining. While he’s never won a championship, he’s been around the block and still a threat to score 20 points a night.
 If the Celtics add one of those “team” guys, preferably Holliday, a two-time NBA All-Defensive First Team member the last two seasons, as Kevin Garnett said a dozen years earlier, “anything is possible.”
 It might not be so simple, though.
 Would “Mr. Celtic” Marcus Smart be a potential casualty in a trade, being every team could use a Marcus Smart?
 What about Kemba Walker’s availability? Do the Celtics look at him differently, despite his great personality, after his disappointing playoff performances, really disappearing acts, against Toronto and Miami? Is his knee a short-term issue or is this the rest of his career? Is his contract – with three years and $108 remaining – a hindrance?
 It’s been a tough few days around here with the passing of Tommy Heinsohn. He was a family member and represented this franchise well.
 But Heinsohn was also about championships, winning nine as a player, two as a head coach and the rest as the biggest Celtics fans, literally and figuratively, alive.
 The Celtics, it appears, mean business going forward. And Ainge has the pieces to move and really contend for a championship or two.
 Isn’t that what we’re all about around here, competing for championships?

 Action Fraud - part of the City of London Police - confirmed as long ago as March that an incredibly similar message was nothing to do with them.
 "We are aware of a rumour currently circulating via WhatsApp, SMS and social media which references the City of London Police Fraud Team and claims that Danske Bank customers are being targeted by a particular text message (smishing) scam. The content of this message is false," Action Fraud wrote.
 "However, smishing scams are common. Don’t click on the links or attachments in any suspicious emails or texts, and never respond to messages that ask for your personal or financial details.
 "It’s important to remember that your bank would never ask you to move money out of your account, or contact you out of the blue and ask for details such as your full banking password or PIN.
 "Anyone who has divulged information after receiving this type of message should contact their Bank immediately."
 Action Fraud has the following advice if you think you've been a target of fraud.
   1. Be wary of clicking on unsolicited messages on social media, email, texts or WhatsApp - even if they appear to come from a trusted contact.   2. Do some online research first - check the official website to see if there is any information available.   3. Ensure that you have anti-virus software on your computer   4. Never give out personal or financial data including usernames, passwords, PINs, ID numbers or memorable phrases.
 If you think you’ve been a victim of fraud, report it to Action Fraud online at actionfraud.police.uk or by calling 0300 123 2040.

“I don't know if we could handle that expense,” said Eastman adding the building is open seven days a week when there is snow.
 Selectman Steve Porter said the town needs to figure out what it would cost to clean the bathrooms every day. He doesn’t think that would be affordable.
 “My first reaction would be let's keep it closed. For the time being,” said Porter.
 Selectman Carl Thibodeau said he’d allow the bathrooms to be open so long as skiers or other “participants” pay for their upkeep. Furthermore, Thibodeau recommended the town hire a cleaning service rather than adding a staff member.
 Eastman said he agrees with Porter and Thibodeau.
 Thibodeau suggested Eastman go back and talk with the “participants” some more and then get back to the selectmen and Eastman agreed.
 “I won't go into what the alternative is, but people who need to go to the bathroom or find a way to go to the bathroom,” said selectman John Colbath. “And that's not good enough.”
 Selectmen are not scheduled to meet next week.
 Meanwhile, in Schouler Park, the restrooms at the New England Ski Museum and North Conway Community Center have remained closed to the public.
 The Gibson-Woodbury Foundation owns the ski museum building. Mark Butterfield, the foundation's executive director, spoke to the Sun Thursday afternoon.
 He said state guidelines are that with COVID bathrooms need to be monitored and cleaned multiple times per day, which is impractical. The North Conway Community Center did the bathroom cleaning at the museum. The other issue, said Butterfield, is that the ski museum has hand blow dryers on the walls and they would have to be removed because they could blow virus in the air. He said the liability of keeping the bathrooms open is too great. The museum itself is open.
 “It looks pretty grim; it doesn't look like we will be able to open till next spring, ” said Butterfield of COVID-19 situation and the ski museum bathrooms.
 If the ski museum bathrooms were open in the summer and fall there would have been lines out the door, said Butterfield adding the whole reason he had the bathrooms built was to support local businesses and the community.
 “There is nobody more than me wants them open,” said Butterfield who used to clean the bathrooms himself every day. “Under the totality of the circumstances it's just not possible.”
 As for the NCCC, “Our bathrooms are closed to the public because we want to keep our program participants safe and limit indoor interactions to only folks in their own group, i.e,. adult pickleball, adult soccer, AA meetings, board meetings, etc.,” said Carrie Burkett, general manager of the community center.

What makes the labor exploitation and injury of racism systemic in a nutshell is the erasure from the foundations of the American democracy genocide and slavery. Instead of this reprehensible past, systemic racism fosters the myth that America was a blank canvas awaiting immigrants of exceptional promise.
 For the anti-racist health of the democracy, Mr. Biden must have his thinking informed by people who have as their own mandate the care of Jim Clyburn’s district in South Carolina, the parts of Black America that have not been destinations for immigrants in a long time. When most politicians address “racism,” they approach it as an isolated phenomenon, one that involves promoting discussion and airing grievances, important, yes, but disconnected from their main work of providing services and large-scale solutions to immediate problems. Instead of splitting apart the dire problems that Americans face, if Mr. Biden is serious about his promises, you will see it in every task force decision he makes.

 The Conway School Board got its first look at the proposed operating budget for the 2021-22 school year on Monday night. The budget in draft form is up $2,113,000, or 5.84 percent over the previous year.
 Among those increases is Unit 8 — Technology Districtwide, which is up $109,489 or 10.89 percent, with a projected budget of $1,115,125.
 “What happened is Google changed their licensing structure (in 2019) and they are enforcing a shorter lifespan to the license on Chromebooks,” said Dale Anderson, technology coordinator for the district. “What that means is that beyond a certain age, the Chromebooks, although they may be functional, we can no longer update the operating system on them.”
 In his budget request, Anderson is seeking $105,280 to replace the Chromebooks at Kennett High and $65,669 to replace them at Kennett Middle. Those expenses are up from $101,200 and $37,000 from the previous year.
 Anderson also seeks additional $31,299 to upgrade PowerSchool, K-12 education software at the high school, middle school and three elementary schools in the district.
 “There a lot of plug-ins, additional modules that are added that we've been adding over the past couple years,” Anderson said. “We’ve got probably close to a dozen of these darn things now that we've added in. PowerSchool, out of the box, it doesn't have everything that we require.”
 Anderson said the middle school will receive new Chromebooks with the approval of this budget by voters next April.
 “A year ago, I was sitting before the board here talking about the Chromebooks and how they have a lifespan to them for your ability to update them,” he said. “We just took delivery of them. This district just bought 712 new Chromebooks, and next year we're going to be buying approximately the same amount.
 “When we went to Chromebooks, we went to them two years all at once. And so when you buy them all at once they expire all at once, unfortunately,” he said.

Spotty showers move in after this morning and off and on light rain will continue into the afternoon. Rainfall amounts will end up around a quarter inch or less by this evening.
 Rain ends later this afternoon and skies will partially clear tonight, allowing temperatures to fall to around 30. High pressure will give us plenty of sunshine tomorrow with a gusty northwest breeze and seasonable temperatures with highs around 50. High clouds build Sunday morning after a cold start. Clouds thicken up throughout the day and rain arrives by mid afternoon. (2-3pm) We will have a slightly milder day with a gusty south breeze ahead of a cold front. Temps will come up into the lower 50's. This front will bring a period of rain Sunday night, but it looks to exit well before sunrise on Monday.

“Even with its limited ability to enact legislation, this administration has already proven to be the most anti-science executive branch in modern history,” a 2017 Brookings Institution paper said. “At almost every turn, Trump has chosen to sideline scientists, leave vacant scientific appointments, reduce or eliminate federal independent scientific boards, and appoint anti- science individuals to powerful positions.”
 The paper came out a week after CDC staff were advised not to use seven words and phrases if they hoped to get federal funding for projects. The words included “transgender,” “fetus,” “evidence-based” and “science-based.”
 In September, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, whose agency should be treating climate change as an existential environmental threat, argued instead that stemming greenhouse gas emissions would be hard on the poor. Actually, it’s the poor who stand to suffer most from climate change as well as from the administration’s loosened air-pollution rules.
 Just this week, the Trump administration removed the official in charge of coordinating climate-change research and producing the annual National Climate Assessment. The last report had angered the White House by painting a catastrophic scenario if climate change were not brought under better control.
