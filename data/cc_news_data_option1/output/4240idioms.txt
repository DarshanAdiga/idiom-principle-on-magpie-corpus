Speaking of snoozing alarms, the new Dot comes with a new ‚Äútap to snooze‚Äù gesture, which actually first appeared on the first-gen Echo Dot with clock. The gesture does exactly as it says: just tap the top of the speaker with more than one finger (you don‚Äôt have to press a specific button) to snooze an alarm for nine minutes, handy for getting more shut-eye without rousing yourself for an Alexa chat.
 On the back of the fourth-gen Dot, you‚Äôll find a 3.5mm audio jack for connecting a wired speaker, a feature that‚Äôs conspicuously missing from Google‚Äôs equivalent Nest Mini smart speaker. There‚Äôs also a barrel-shaped power port for connecting the Dot‚Äôs five-foot power cord, which (same as the older Dot) terminates in a chunky, outlet-blocking 15-watt power supply.

Anyone interested in the fate of high school winter sports season will have to wait a few more days for any further information.
   
 But the wait is over for athletes wondering if they can compete for both school and club programs simultaneously this spring and summer..
   
 The Illinois High School Association board of directors met Monday for its regularly scheduled virtual meeting and opted to set up a special meeting for Oct. 28 to announce details about winter sports.
   
 "We understand that student-athletes, coaches, parents, officials, and fans are anxious to learn more details about the plans for IHSA winter sports," IHSA Executive Director Craig Anderson said in a news release.
   
 "We feel like we are making positive strides in our discussions with the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) to be allowed to conduct IHSA winter sports as scheduled. We believe we have a plan to do so safely and want to provide IDPH with ample time to review the winter sports plans, and supportive data, we have provided them.
   
 "We expect to have a response from IDPH with final recommendations for winter sport plans, including any accommodations and postseason plans, by October 26. We will then reconvene our Board to officially vote and announce that information shortly thereafter."
   
 Currently, the winter sports season is scheduled to begin with practices on Nov. 16 and games starting Nov. 30.
   
 Sports affected include boys and girls basketball, wrestling, boys swimming and diving, cheerleading, dance, boys and girls bowling and girls gymnastics.
   
 Basketball is considered a "medium" IDPH risk, with wrestling, cheerleading and dance labeled at "higher." Swimming and diving, bowling and gymnastics are all considered "lower" risks.
   
 The board also discussed a proposal to postpone wrestling until the summer season. The board plans to take action on that proposal at the special meeting Oct. 28.
   
 The IHSA board also voted to provide a one-time accommodation to the IHSA's independent team by-law, applicable for the the 2020-2021 school year only, granting specific exemptions to only spring and summer season sports.
   
 The winter sports mentioned earlier, which remain in their traditional seasons, will not have an accommodation.
   
 According to the IHSA release, sports competing in the IHSA's 2021 spring season (football, boys soccer, girls volleyball) "will be granted the accommodation to participate simultaneously on school teams and non-school teams throughout the duration of their high school season (Feb. 15-May 1)."
   
 Sports competing in the IHSA's 2021 summer season (baseball, softball, track & field, girls soccer, boys volleyball, lacrosse, boys tennis) "will be granted the accommodation to participate simultaneously on school teams and non-school teams beginning on June 4. The summer season is slated to run from April 19 to June 26."
   
 "The Board determined it was prudent to make modifications to the independent team by-law for the sports that were displaced from their traditional high school season," said Anderson. "They also came up with what we believe is a reasonable compromise for summer sports. The Board is hopeful that the high school teams will be given priority when conflicts occurs.
   
 "We believe making a modification now will allow high school coaches and non- school team coaches to begin communication on how they can collaboratively resolve scheduling conflicts."

In the early days we were, almost immediately that people were admitted, putting them in ICU, sedating them and putting them on a ventilator.
 'We started to use more non-invasive ventilation and patients were doing very well.'
 Ventilation aids breathing. The mechanical type, given to patients who are struggling to breathe on their own, comes with risks.
 A tube must be placed down the airways, which is obstructive. There is a growing suspicion the machines actually inflame the airways and lungs of some patients even further.
 Once a patient is on ventilation, studies have shown there is a low chance of survival, so doctors consider it the last resort.
 But it was considered a first-port of call for many of the most critically ill Covid-19 patients at the peak because Covid-19 represented itself as a respiratory disease.
 ICNARC reported last month that 84 per cent of Covid-19 patients in ICU were hooked up to ventilators during their hospital stint in the earliest days of the pandemic, compared to 62 per cent in September.
 As time has worn on, doctors have been wary of unnecessary ventilation. In a letter published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine in March, researchers in Germany and Italy said Covid-19 patients need only 'gentle' ventilation.
 More patients are now treated using things like CPAP machines ‚Äî a face mask with a pump that controls airflow ‚Äî that is also used to treat the disorder sleep apnoea.
 The device keeps the airways continuously open in those patients who are able to breathe on their own but it stops their lungs from collapsing.
 What's more, it's become evident Covid-19 is more than a disease that impacts the lungs. Doctors discovered it causes deadly blood clots and 'cytokine storms', where the body's immune system turns on itself.
 'We saw the effect on blood clotting. We recognise the disease a lot earlier,' Dr Pittard said.
 Inflammation caused by the 'cytokine storm' can now be treated with a steroid called dexamethasone.
 The cheap drug, which was approved for use in the UK in June, is thought to have contributed to falling death rates across the board considering it cuts the odds of an individual patient dying by a third. However, it is hard to say how much impact the drug has had.
 It is also possible that recruitment to large drug trials, such as the RECOVERY trial, improved outcomes for patients from around April onwards.
 Drugs, such as remdesivir, which was the first to be given the go-ahead for use in the NHS in May, have shown to shorten time in ICU and length of illness.
 Doctors also say that during the peak of the pandemic, hospitals were at capacity and staff were off sick self-isolating, and this may have implicated on the ability to care for patients.
 When cases surge and hospitals fill up, 'staff are stretched, mistakes are made, it's no one's fault ‚Äî it's that the system isn't built to operate near 100%,' Mr Mateen said.
 His paper suggests the observed drop in mortality may partially be due to 'unsafe' levels of capacity easing as hospital admissions slowed down.

National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) has decided to extend the validity of the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) and various state TETs to lifetime, according to theTimes of India. Earlier the validity of various TET certificates was 7 years which has now been extended.
 The report says that the decision to extend the validity of TET certificate was taken by the NCTE at its 50th General Body meeting on September 29. TOI accessed the minutes of the meeting which revealed the information.
 The report also said that the provision would come into effect prospectively and NCTE would take legal opinion for candidates who already have a TET certificate issued from the CBSE or from any state board.
 The report says that the decision has not yet been implemented and various state and central boards will ratify the amendment and notify the implementation of the decision. Candidates can expect a formal announcement of the same from various boards soon.
 CBSE and state education boards conduct the TET exams to certify the eligibility of candidates to teach at the schools affiliated to the respective boards.
 Boards are supposed to conduct the TET exam at least twice in a year but most boards have not been able to meet the criteria. Also, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. the TET exams for various boards had to be postponed.

FIUV Position Papers

_(Let me say this up front. This is a musing from this singular columnist and should not, in any way, be read as an endorsement of a candidate by this newspaper.)_
 I was pondering something this election season. What I want, more than anything else, is a person who leads not his base, not his party, but his people.
 Take, for example, Cris Dush, who is running for the state Senate this year. I had formed an opinion of him based on observing him at a few political events. It wasn‚Äôt a good one, I‚Äôll admit. But my dad, who has this strange ability to change his opinion of people, has told me that I may not have been wrong about Dush in the past, but am wrong about him now.
 Maybe the ability to see people in the now and not lock them in your past assessments is something you gain with age. As I approach 40, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve become far more likely to create a file about someone in my head, set it to ‚ÄúNo Overwrite,‚Äù and stay that way. Dad, well, he can allow new information to alter that file.
 Anyway, Dad said that he had the opportunity to talk to Rep. Dush one-on-one due to a thing Dad was doing for Reynoldsville. Dad has been trying to help Reynoldsville embrace the 21st Century, and he had this moment with Dush and just Dush. No rally. No politics. Just Dush and the needs of a community.
 And Dad was impressed.
 Dush could have ignored Reynoldsville as a small piece of his (let‚Äôs admit it) future senate district, but he didn‚Äôt. He listened. He made my dad, who isn‚Äôt a terrible judge of character, think that Dush would represent everyone in his district, even Reynoldsville.
 And that made me think, what do I really want from a political leader?
 Democrat or Republican, does that matter in state-level politics? President Trump has already said that he will lead his base. While he lost the popular vote ‚Äì and will do so again, while winning the Electoral College again this November ‚Äì President Trump has made it clear that he will not lead the majority, but his base. The rest of us don‚Äôt matter. The future doesn‚Äôt matter. But in state-level politics, I think there‚Äôs still hope.
 Let‚Äôs admit it, Democrats in our area who run against Republicans know they won‚Äôt win. They know they can‚Äôt win. But I like to think that they run to show Dush and others that there are people who disagree with the usual party line. They run to bring ideas and issues to the forefront, shouting above the echo chamber politicians usually live in.
 (Either that, or they‚Äôre delusional. But I choose to believe the optimistic point of view since I‚Äôm depressed enough looking at the path we‚Äôve chosen as a country.)
 And I think people like Dush listen. If he‚Äôs willing to see one community as a community of needs, of people who are his people, then I think he may not be the man I thought he was. That‚Äôs a good thing.
 2020\. One of the worst years in America since 1929. Maybe what we need to do this year is allow people to show us that they‚Äôve grown beyond party politics. Not on a national level, but on the state level. Maybe we can‚Äôt fix national politics ‚Äì and throwing your vote away on a third-party candidate has become such a joke that I refuse to believe anyone with a Jorgensen flag isn‚Äôt just a troll ‚Äì but we can take control of local and state politics.
 What I want, Mr. Dush and other Republicans who are going to win the elections coming up, is someone who can look at the community and see people, not politics. We need something from you ‚Äì an intelligent COVID-19 response, better-paying jobs, a solid response to the opioid crisis, improved infrastructure, reliable and fast internet, training for people who have lost jobs, a plan for when coal ceases to be a viable industry, environmental policies that ensure a safe world for our children, and hope. We can‚Äôt get that from Washington, but we can get that from you.
 If you aren‚Äôt up to that challenge, then do us all a favor and drop out. We need leaders who look at the future instead of clinging to the past like a security blanket that they‚Äôre too afraid to let go of.
 Why am I bothering to say all this? My dad came away from a conversation with Rep. Dush that gave him hope. And I desperately want to learn to change my mind about people and the future.
 I want hope.

Data virtualization is data integration technology. It contains data from multiple location formats and sources without duplicating the data to create a single "virtual" data layer that provides integrated data services to support a wide range of users and applications. Data virtualization can also be considered as a replacement for data warehousing and ETL (extracting, transforming, and loading). Data virtualization technology is an integral part of modern data architecture. This is primarily due to adaptability and the ability to quickly integrate new data sources and deliver information to business customers in real-time. It is widely used by companies to improve their IT infrastructure through competitive pricing, better performance, and a trusted environment. Companies are currently in high demand for data virtualization solutions because they can improve business operations and provide logical data warehousing and advanced data management capabilities. In contrast to the traditional extraction, transformation, and loading ("ETL") process, the data stays in place and real-time access to the source system is granted for the data. This reduces the risk of data errors and data shifting through the workload that may never be used, and no attempt is made to impose the data on a single data model (an example of heterogeneous data is a federated database system). The technology also supports writing transaction data updates back to the source systems. To correct differences in source and consumer formats and semantics, different abstraction and transformation techniques are used. This concept and software are a subset of data integration and are widely used in business intelligence, data services with a service-oriented architecture, cloud computing, enterprise search, and master data management.

 With 145 in-person learners and 65 students participating remotely, Conway Elementary‚Äôs total enrollment of 210 is down slightly from September 2019, according to Principal Jason Robert.
 According to the COVID-19 Schools Dashboard website, as of Monday, there were 151 active cases of COVID-19 in New Hampshire colleges and K-12 schools, including 23 cases at the University of New Hampshire; nine at Saint Anselm College; five at Keene State College; two each at Dartmouth College, Keene State College and New England College; and one each at Colby Sawyer College and the UNH School of Law.
 For the first time since June 17, according to WMUR (Channel 9), ‚ÄúThere are more than 1,000 current cases of COVID-19 in New Hampshire. The number has been steadily rising since late September, from 303 on Sept. 26 to 1,020 on Monday.
 ‚ÄúHealth officials announced 57 new positive cases Monday. Officials said 41 of the new cases were positive PCR tests, and 16 tested positive by antigen test. The daily PCR test positivity rate was 1.1 percent.
 ‚ÄúSince the start of the pandemic, 9,746 positive cases have been confirmed in New Hampshire.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúThe entire school community has worked very hard to bring our students back to our facilities safely,‚Äù the letter states.

It should also be acknowledged that there are many other schools in New Hampshire and across the country that are still in full remote or hybrid scenarios currently. There is a need for continued vigilance toward following established guidelines and procedures so that we can continue to provide face to face learning.
 ‚ÄúAs we approach the holiday travel season, it is important to stress that non- essential travel outside of New England continues to be highly discouraged by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.‚Äù

An elected auditor is supposed to do the books every year but a firm can be hired at any point to do an audit, he said adding an audit is expensive.
 Chandler said progress on the 2019 audit has been waylaid by the COVID-19 Pandemic.
 Asked how the town was getting its business done over the time period the board didn‚Äôt meet, Chandler explained that the board members would come to town hall individually to sign checks and respond to other documents as necessary.
 ‚ÄúEverything got done,‚Äù said Chandler. ‚ÄúPeople would drop stuff off. It was all handled.‚Äù
 Chandler explained that if the selectmen were to meet then the public would have to be allowed to come but the town office was closed.
 ‚ÄúWe finally got hooked up with the Zoom thing,‚Äù he said.
 Chandler said the board has met about four times since the end of September.
 Towns are legally required to do an audit, said Kneuer. DRA can enforce the audit requirement by ordering an audit for the town. If DRA orders an audit that work is contracted out to a firm.
 The DRA does not have a set deadline for when it would step in but it would evaluate the situation at the end of the current calendar year and take additional steps if demonstrable progress isn‚Äôt made by that point, said Gerry.
 ‚ÄúWe have had difficulty in contacting them and really have not been able to speak with them about this,‚Äù said Gerry. ‚ÄúAs soon as this year‚Äôs tax rate setting is done, then we focus on other things, which includes audits. Our main concern is ascertaining why they have not produced the audits the law requires. We would like to know what their rationale is for the delay and when we could expect them to comply with State law. If we do not receive a satisfactory answer, we would enact a plan based upon the best information possible at that time.‚Äù
 The Sun asked Chandler about the possibility of DRA stepping in.
 ‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs their business,‚Äù said Chandler.
 The Sun spoke to all three selectmen at the selectmen‚Äôs meeting on Tuesday (Oct. 20). Chandler said either Vachon Clukay would contact the town when they are ready or the town would reach out to them and see when they will be ready.
 Garland said it has been a challenge for the town not to have regular selectmen‚Äôs meeting for so long.
 ‚ÄúThere have been many many changes but I would like to commend everybody who works at town hall who rose to the challenge and met the needs of our town,‚Äù said Garland.
 Gerry said DRA knows anecdotally from municipalities around the state that the COVID problem delayed auditing field work.
 ‚ÄúCOVID has had a substantially negative impact on municipalities throughout the state to meet deadlines,‚Äù said Gerry.

The deciding factor between the Echo Dot and the Google Nest Mini is which voice assistant you‚Äôd rather pledge your loyalty to. If you‚Äôre going the Alexa way, then you would be best off going all-in with the Alexa and Echo ecosystem. If you‚Äôre more partial to Google Assistant, stick with Google Assistant-powered speakers and smart displays. Take it from me, mixing and matching voice assistants in your home is a recipe for endless confusion, not to mention a thicket of frustrating compatibility issues.
 ## Should you upgrade?
 There‚Äôs no question that the new Echo Dot is better than the third-gen Dot it‚Äôs replacing, but is it a _lot_ better? Hmm. Yes, the fourth-gen Echo Dot has slightly better audio quality than its predecessor, but we‚Äôre not talking a knockout punch here. And while the latest Dot has the more impressive design, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, and I‚Äôm sure plenty of Alexa users might prefer the older Dot‚Äôs more understated look.
 Price is also a factor, with the third-generation Echo Dot getting a permanent $10 price cut to $40. The newer $50 Echo Dot will surely see its own discounts as we enter the holiday buying season, but if you‚Äôre looking to populate your home with Dots, $40 for the older model is enticing.
 In other words, no, there‚Äôs no need to trade in your old Echo Dots for the new one, and if you‚Äôre looking to save some cash by opting for the cheaper, third- gen Dot, you wouldn‚Äôt be missing out on much‚Äîthat is, unless you really have it in for hockey pucks.

 DuBois-based state police filed charges against Jonathan Matthew Todd, 43, of New Kensington, on Oct. 5 including aggravated assault ‚Äìattempt to cause serious bodily injury or causes injury with extreme indifference, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, two counts of simple assault, and harassment, according to court documents.
 Police also filed charges against William Joseph Todd, 40, of New Kensington, on Oct. 5 including strangulation, simple assault, and harassment, court documents show.
 According to the affidavit of probable cause, police were dispatched to Penn Highlands DuBois for a gunshot victim. When police questioned William Todd, he allegedly said he did not know what happened.
 While at the hospital, police also spoke to the brothers‚Äô father, who allegedly said he had picked the two up from the bar and brought them home. Once home, their father said he went inside to check the fire and heard a gunshot while inside. When he walked outside, he reported finding William Todd on the ground with a hole in his left pant leg.
 Police then went to the scene to speak with Jonathan Todd. According to the affidavit, Jonathan Todd told police he and William got into a struggle, and William allegedly choked him to the point of blacking out multiple times. He told police there were also fists thrown between the two of them.
 Jonathan allegedly told William to knock it off or he would shoot him in the knee. At this time Jonathan said he got a handgun from his truck. When William allegedly approached him again, he gave a warning by firing into the ground, then admittedly shot William in the knee. He told police he handed the gun to their father before going inside.
 Both William and Jonathan Todd have preliminary hearings scheduled for Dec. 7 with Magisterial Judge Gregory Bazylak.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a laying bare of the fragility of our way of life.‚Äù
 Choosing wine produced without a cocktail of chemicals, with emphasis on protecting and improving soil quality and creating safe conditions in vineyard and cellar, increasingly makes sense.
 As another of the Harpers debate speakers predicted: ‚ÄúPeople will be thinking of the cost of NOT buying organic.‚Äù
 The UK is one of the top five organic wine-consuming nations, but has a long way to go to reach Sweden‚Äôs enthusiasm ‚Äì there, some 22 per cent of all wine sold is organic (world-wide, the figure not yet three per cent).
 Today, there is no need to compromise when buying organic wine ‚Äì the time when taste was sacrificed to principle has long gone, at lower price levels as well as high. Search ‚Äúorganic wine‚Äù on the websites of sellers as diverse as Sainsbury‚Äôs or Berry Bros & Rudd, or go to specialists such as Vintage Roots, and you‚Äôll be spoiled for choice, in both style and place of origin.
 There are organic wine producers world wide, though Europe has led the way ‚Äì in such less likely locations as Alsace and the Loire Valley, even damp England, as well as the dry plains of Castile or Etna‚Äôs lava-strewn slopes.
 As sales increase, more growers will change. ‚ÄúIt costs more at the beginning,‚Äù said Juan Pablo Murgia, head winemaker at organic Bodega Argento in Argentina (his new Artesano malbec is in Tesco, ¬£10).
 ‚ÄúBut with time the health of the vineyard improves and it will produce more year by year ‚Äì the opposite of what happens with non-organic vines.‚Äù

No. 1-ranked Timberlake (7-0 overall, 4-0 District C-3) answered some questions in a 66-36 win over Medford last Thursday.
 The Tigers responded from trailing in a game for the first time this season in a roller first half, but then outscored the Cardinals, 38-14. It was only the second time this season they didn't win a game by the 45-point mercy rule.
 "We knew going in Medford had a good team and we were going to play the whole four quarters, which was good for us,'' said Timberlake coach Brian Severin. "I was proud of the way we responded. The boys kept plugging away and kept doing what we were supposed to do and won the ballgame. We stayed the course and wore them down.''

Our products are not only the finest available in Oregon, they‚Äôre inspired by our philosophy and our values. What we‚Äôre accomplishing in Oregon doesn‚Äôt just offer the opportunity for transformative treatment in the lives of patients who use Green Star Growing products, it offers the opportunity for transformative change in the lives of agricultural workers and communities in rural Oregon. Green Star Growing is committed to investing in training, education, and infrastructure development in southern Oregon. The 21st Century economy has left many rural workers and communities behind, and we believe responsible marijuana cultivation and processing can help kick-start opportunities for folks not just in the cannabis industry, but also in the communities that host those businesses.

The district also tracks student progress every month through subject-based computer programs. Superintendent Estrada says the district's goal every year is to help students advance one and a half years in English and math each school year. He says although the district won't be able to specifically determine if the internet is behind that growth, he believes without equitable access, the district would fall short of that goal.

It was not clear whether Jumper took part in the initial stop or was in the patrol car.
 Jumper "was a man of integrity and passion. When I say passion. I mean the man was dedicated, a law man," the sheriff said. "He was truly larger than life. Literally and figuratively. At six foot four, he was a gentle giant who always wore a contagious smile."
 The deputy served the county for almost 28 years, the last of which were spent on an interdiction team, the sheriff said. He is survived by his wife and daughter.
 "Jumper was an officer who embodied the true essence of a public servant," the sheriff said.

To be clear, not all healthcare stocks will be winners if Biden's tax plan becomes law. However, healthcare companies that offer exceptional pricing power will be able to pass along higher costs to patients and insurers, much in the same way that utilities are likely to increase rates on their customers. What this suggests is that low-margin healthcare stocks (e.g., pharmacy chains) could see earnings decline, whereas the majority of drug and device makers would be largely unfazed.

Severin credited that to interior linemen Cade Severin, Colton Lorman, Jacob Dillard and Connor Griffin.
 "They wore Medford down,'' he said. "They do a very good job of staying on someone. They are in very good shape and know their football which makes it easier to do things.''
 The Tigers have to be in good shape with just 15 players on the roster. Severin and assistant Josh Worman must fill out the scout team for Timberlake to be able to scrimmage eight on eight in practice.
 "We're limited on numbers which is kind of sad,'' Severin said. "It's the sign of the times. For some reason, kids don't want to play. But all 15 kids can play. We don't drop off a lot from eight to nine to 10. We really stress conditioning every day because we know we will be in situations where we will have to play past halftime. We were tickled to death we got to play past halftime.''
 Running back J.J. Pippin ran for 316 yards and six touchdowns, including his second 99-yard run of the season in the third period. He has scored 17 touchdowns this season. The Tigers ran for a season-high 455 yards. Carter Sands added 82 yards on seven carries, his best game of the season.
 Quarterback Ethan Jenlink was five of eight passing for 101 yards to give him 19 for the season. Merric Judd has 11 scoring receptions with Dylan Schlup having five.
 "He's a 4.0 student who is really sharp,'' Severin said. "He sees things better than he did last year which makes us more efficient. Merric and Dylan catch the ball really well and gives us deep threats.''
 Timberlake goes for its eighth straight win when it hosts Bartlesville Wesleyan Christian (3-4 overall, 3-1 in district) at 7 p.m. Friday. BWC lost to Medford 58-13 on Oct. 9, but mercy-ruled Copan 50-0 last week.
