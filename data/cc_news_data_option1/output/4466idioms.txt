The six candidates seeking to become the island’s next governor include Pedro Pierluisi of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. He's the territory’s former non-voting representative in Congress and briefly served as governor following huge street protests last year that led to the resignation of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. Also on the ballot is a referendum on whether to change Puerto Rico's political status from territory to state. That vote is advisory as Congress would have to approve any change.

Yo creo que el judío que vota por un candidato no vota por un solo tema, sino por varios. Entonces, algún judío “trumpista” te dice que lo vota por Israel pero a lo mejor lo vota porque le gusta la plataforma económica, y otro te puede decir que vota a Biden porque le parece que los demócratas tienen sensibilidad social pero a la vez porque sabe que la bolsa nunca tuvo valores tan altos como con los demócratas. No hay una única forma de votar para los judíos. Si un judío dice que vota a Trump porque nunca Israel tuvo un mejor aliado, tiene razón, y si uno dice que vota a Biden porque cree que representa los valores judíos en una forma correcta, también tiene razón.
