In an "Oaktree Insights" letter published Thursday, Jones said the economy hasn't fully recovered from the depths of the coronavirus crash. "Until fundamentals really do improve, conflicting economic data and political shocks could spark more market ructions," they said, adding that the economic recovery largely depends on when the pandemic can be resolved. "The fundamentals tell us we're not out of the woods yet," the portfolio manager said, citing the historically high unemployment level in the US, and a GDP that rebounded strongly but is still well below pre-pandemic levels.

Reynolds was later cleared of any violations of department policies by the Anderson Board of Public Safety.
 Broderick said the department had in-car cameras in the 1990s but the quality was not very good. He said the major cost is the storage of information.
 Since June, Chief Jake Brown and assistant chief Mike Lee have put in a substantial amount of time in analyzing the equipment to determine what would be best for the department, Broderick said.
 “Our plan is to have in-car cameras for all patrol cars and marked vehicles as well as cameras inside a few of our specialty vehicles, such as our transport van, we anticipate this would be 80 cameras,” Broderick said in October.
 “These cameras will allow the department another tool to collect evidence, protect officers from unfounded allegations, while at the same time providing transparency to the public our officers serve,” he said.

 Although the Flemensfirth gelding has a long way to go to emulate his Grade One-winning half-brother Simonsig, there was plenty to like about his two-and- a-half-length debut success in the Download The tote App Novices’ Hurdle.
 Henderson said of the 7-4 shot: “We’ve looked at lots of Simonsig’s relations over the years. Ronnie’s (Bartlett, owner) words were always the same – ‘could Maradona’s brother play football!’.
 “He went to Ian Ferguson’s and he would have run in a point-to-point in the spring for Ian as Simonsig started with Ian as well. He has done nothing but please you at home as he was very well educated thanks to Ian.
 “He works great and jumps so well, that’s why I didn’t bother with a bumper. Nico said he was fantastic. For his first run of his life he knew his job well.”

 "Claressa Shields doesn’t want none of me. She doesn’t. I’ll tell you that now."
 Marshall v Shields promises to be a blockbuster in 2021, another fight which makes it all the more frustrating that fans are not returning to arenas up and down the UK or US any time soon.
 And while Marshall recognises that if the pandemic rumbles on she may have no choice but to take on Shields behind closed doors, realistically she feels there has to be a crowd.
 "I believe that fight is the biggest fight in female boxing history," she said. "And the fans need to be there."

 “All these years, we have been working towards improving the farm yield to feed the growing population of the country. The farm sector has come a long way from the food for all slogan to today’s nutritious food for all. However, we have forgotten about the farmers and about their profitability. It is time we thought about it,” said Mr. Nagi Reddy.
 The State government is doling out subsidies to the tune of ₹3,200 crore to farmers as input cost has been increasing.
 “Unless we concentrate on productivity and marketing, achieving profitability in the agriculture sector is not possible,” he pointed out.
 Speaking on the occasion, Agriculture Mission member and AF Ecology Director Y.V. Malla Reddy said the ARS, Rekulakunta must concentrate on farmer-oriented research in arid region.
 The ARS, Rekulakunta has the potential to become a specialised institution for the arid region crops and function as a university, he said.
 The ARS, Rekulakunta has set up a cold oil press unit, along with a bottling plant, on its premises with an investment of ₹7.5 lakh. The machine has the capacity to extract oil from 20 kg of pulses.
 ## ‘ANGRAU Gold’
 A kg of groundnut yields 400 ml of oil and 600 grams of oil-cake. The Acharya NG Ranga Agriculture University has proposed to market it on a commercial basis under the brand name of ‘ANGRAU Gold’. The machine can extract oil from sesame and safflower without needing any modifications, said ARS Rekulakuinta Director Sahadev Reddy. Joint Director Agriculture Ramakrishna was present on the occasion.

“It would be incredibly important if Lewis could speak out. However, the onus is not just on the star drivers but the whole industry to be aware of what is happening in Saudi Arabia.
 “If the right people are prepared to speak out and make those kind of interventions it can really throw Saudi Arabia’s human rights’ record back under the spotlight and hopefully increase pressure on them to do the right thing.
 “Formula One talks about diversification and inclusivity and appealing to LBGT people, so it needs to make a sustained effort on human rights ahead of this race.
 “If they can show that everything in their supply chain is free from human rights violations then that would be a big thing. But we also want them to speak out in support of those jailed women’s human rights defenders and, more generally, the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia.”
 In the past, F1 has also faced criticism for staging races in China, Russia, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan.
 In the lead-up to a race in Jeddah, we would urge all F1 drivers, owners and teams to consider speaking out about the human rights situation in the country
 An F1 spokesperson said: “For decades Formula One has worked hard be a positive force everywhere it races, including economic, social, and cultural benefits.

OCONOMOWOC — The Brownberry Bread Outlet Store, 1 Meadow Road, in Oconomowoc closed earlier in the spring when the pandemic started, but if and when it will open again is still up in the air.
 Nicole Lasorda with Buchanan Public Relations, who handles Bimbo Bakeries USA, said Bimbo is constantly evaluating when it can reopen the outlet store.
 “At this time the Oconomowoc store doesn’t have a set reopening date,” Lasorda said.
 Lasorda said she was unable to answer whether the outlet store anticipated opening in the future or if the reasoning behind it still being closed was driven by the pandemic circumstances.
 Bimbo Bakeries USA owns a Brownberry Bread bakery right next to the outlet in Oconomowoc.
