After getting to the top it wasn't too bad for a bit but then we were flying down near-vertical (possibly 20-degree) grassy slopes.
 I realised at that stage that I probably should have opted for actual trail- running shoes with claw-like grip rather than a regular running shoe that would slip on a piece of sandpaper.
 Miraculously, I didn't end up on my butt.
 But my knees were feeling it.
 And then we were confronted with 9km of sometimes steady, and sometimes tear- inducing, steep climbs.
 Just to add another element to the challenge, it was a Tassie "heatwave" that day too.
 28 deg or so - nuthin! So I thought.
 I was determined to keep running for as long as possible but the climbs up bare hills in the baking sun were taking their toll.
 I ended up walking through portions knowing I still had many km ahead.
 I got to the first spot of the crew rendezvous where I was to shoot a stand-up and was over the moon because it meant I could stop jogging.
 This is only 5km in!
 I pulled myself together for the stand-up, reapplied the sunscreen and then headed off into the fields of pain amid the stunning backdrop.
 The next rendezvous point with the crew was 16km in, after all the climbing had been been done.
 200m before that point, at the top of a huge climb, my calves started seizing up.
 I had put too much crazy effort in going up the hills and not been sucking up enough sustenance in the days before through electrolytes (someone later told me).
 I had nine days of this shoot left to go and I didn't want to be hobbling around in pain so I was thinking of leaving it at that.
 I tripped at the key point where the crew was getting a shot of me and nearly died of embarrassment.

But because Baldessari was based in California and not New York, where many of the other Conceptualists worked, he was considered an outsider--an artist who could not take his work seriously enough to matter. Kosuth, for one, famously dismissed Baldessari's art as "'conceptual' cartoons." Yet Baldessari kept abreast of what was taking place halfway across the world, and in 1972, for a video called _Baldessari Sings LeWitt_ , he intoned pieces of artist Sol LeWitt's "Sentences on Conceptual Art" to the tune of the "Star Spangled Banner" and other popular ditties. Baldessari once told _New Yorker_ critic Calvin Tomkins, "The Conceptualists thought I was just doing joke art, and I thought theirs was boring."

Not surprisingly, _Rise of Skywalker_ was the winner for the third weekend in a row, bringing in an estimated $33.7 million and bringing the total for the final installment in the Skywalker Saga to $450.8 million so far. That reflects an okay 53% hold from last weekend and puts the film 15% behind the pace of 2017’s _The Last Jedi_ , which had $517.2 million by the same point in its run. Despite boasting a favorable 86% Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes—exactly double _The Last Jedi_ ’s 43%—the film continues to perform on the more conservative end of expectations and may well fall short of its predecessor by the end of its North American run. The film is nonetheless doing brisk business all things considered, having now become the eighth- fastest title to hit the $450 million mark domestically.

It\u2019s not often that you get to merge personal passions into a professional life, but that\u2019s what Kellen did when he launched Droid Life in 2009. After working years of unsatisfying jobs in the medical and property management fields, he took a risk to try and create an online community while playing with the coolest gadgets on the planet each day, a risk that has turned out to be incredibly rewarding. Outside of Droid Life, Kellen is your typical Portlander who drinks way too much good beer, complains often about the Trail Blazers, and can be found out on the streets for a run, rain or shine.
