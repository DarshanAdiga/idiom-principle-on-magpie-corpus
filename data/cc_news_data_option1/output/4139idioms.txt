"I think it has since moved on (from an underdog) into a team that is an incredibly good team that's in a very much win-now mode," Schmidt said, "and there are casualties to that."

“He's doubtful,” Orgeron said on the Southeastern Conference's weekly coaches' teleconference Wednesday. "Maybe by Friday he'll come around. I think he's going to practice toward the end of the week."
 Orgeron added that LSU “may have to” have a freshman quarterback — either Max Johnson or TJ Finley — make his first-career start on the road against the Gators.
 “Max and T.J. both had great practices" this week, Orgeron said. "They are both equal right now. Both of those young men are doing a great job, and if we have to start one of them, we're going to do it and I'm going to believe in them.”
 LSU's quarterback situation could become moot because of questions surrounding whether the game will be played this weekend. That depends on how Florida's program comes through a recent spike in positive COVID-19 tests that led the program to announce it was pausing team activities on Tuesday. Coach Dan Mullen said the team was awaiting results from another round of testing on Wednesday and didn't want to speculate on prospects for keeping Saturday's game on schedule.
 Orgeron said Brennan's injury occurred when he kept the ball along the right sidelined and took a big upper-body hit from two Missouri defenders near the goal line late in the first quarter of last Saturday's 45-41 loss to Mizzou. Brennan never came out of the game, however.
 “He was pretty bruised up," Orgeron said. “He went in at halftime. He was very sore. It was hard for him to rotate to throw the ball, but he went out in the second half and he didn’t blink, so I was very proud of him.”
 As for Brennan's backups, Johnson was a top recruit out of Georgia. His father is former NFL QB Brad Johnson, who won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
 Finley is from southeast Louisiana and was rated by recruiting analysts as the state's top high school quarterback in 2019.
 “Max is probably more of a runner a little bit. TJ has a strong arm," Orgeron said. "Both of them are phenomenal young players.”

In the early months of the U.S. pandemic, banks set aside tens of billions of dollars to cover losses that could come from loans that were suddenly going bad. Millions of Americans and store owners, who were reliable borrowers before the pandemic, now found themselves out of work or their businesses temporarily shuttered. Bank executives said in April that they were taking "everything but the kitchen sink" approach to these loans since they were unsure how long the pandemic was going to last.

They also said they would like to see the city and county work together more.                                                                                                                                                                          After the candidates' closing statements, the forum turned to the Northern District race between Thompson, the incumbent Democrat, and Asbury.                                                                                                                                                                           Asbury, small business owner and director of strategic communications for the Missouri Association of Realtors, said he would push for greater transparency in the commission. He added that he would advocate for the use of some of the city’s practices — making virtual public attendance and recordings of meetings available online.                                                                                                                                                                           Thompson responded that the commission was already quite transparent. She added that these were ideas that had been considered, but the commission is on the fence about finding the funding to implement them.                                                                                                                                                                           She also said that she didn’t differ much from Asbury on the issues, but her experience elevated her ability to follow through effectively.                                                                                                                                                                           Generally, the two candidates agreed when it came to the question of how the county should respond to COVID-19. They both stressed the importance of masks and abiding by health ordinances.                                                                                                                                                                           But daylight found its way through the cracks in the candidates' stances on CARES Act funding distribution.                                                                                                                                                                           Thompson argued that the criticized delay in the funding’s distribution was a justifiable choice.                                                                                                                                                                          “I think that the delay that’s happened has allowed us to be more attuned to the real needs of our community, rather than willy-nilly sending the money out in some pro forma way,” she said.

Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg on Wednesday urged EU leaders to "do as much as possible" to step up the bloc's ambitions to reduce carbon output at this week's summit.
 "Of course none of what has been proposed or pushed is in line with the science, but we are still demanding them to do as much as possible... to commit to what they had promised to do" in the 2015 Paris Agreement, Thunberg told AFP in a video interview.
 "It is odd how words and actions don't add up," German Fridays for Future activist Lisa Neubauer said of European leaders' climate commitments.
 "It appears like the ones who have made the most claims are the ones who back up the most," she added, singling out French President Emmanuel Macron in particular.
 Leaders must agree by the end of this year on their 2030 targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the European Commission has proposed a goal of slashing them 55 percent compared with 1990 levels -- up from 40 percent under earlier plans.
 The ultimate aim under Brussels' timetable would be carbon neutrality by 2050.
 Now heads of government will have their say, and must hammer out an option palatable to a European Parliament that has already criticised the Commission's plan as not ambitious enough.
 On Wednesday, 11 member states including France, Spain and the Netherlands backed reductions of "at least 55 percent" by 2030.
 But many countries in the EU's east, notably coal-intensive heavyweight Poland, are reluctant, and Germany -- which holds the EU's rotating presidency -- is keen to achieve unanimity.
 "There's a narrative that some countries are leading, and some countries are the bad guys. But what we need to shine a light on is that even those who are seen as leaders are so unbelievably far from doing what is enough," Thunberg said.
 Climate charities have warned that reductions of 55 or even 60 percent in EU greenhouse output would fall short of what's needed to keep global warming below the two-degrees-Celsius ceiling agreed in Paris.
 Leaders like Macron have "an incredible opportunity and responsibility to take," Thunberg said.
 "And if people like him can't take it, if not even countries like France can't take the responsibility, then how can we expect countries like China or India to live up to their commitments?"

I'm quite sad about it. I'll be completely honest. I am actually gutted for him that he missed that competition. He was arguably the best midfielder in the world at the time and he was going to a tournament that was actually wide open. I'm not saying we would have gone on to win it but we got knocked out on pens by Spain, we missed a pen in normal time and I just think having him on the pitch would have been that little bit more we needed to get through.

Millions of Americans and store owners, who were reliable borrowers before the pandemic, now found themselves out of work or their businesses temporarily shuttered.

Bottom-placed Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) will be under tremendous pressure as they now face a must-win situation when they take on the Virat Kohli-led Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Thursday.After losing six of their seven games, the KL Rahul-led KXIP are languishing at the bottom of the points table with two points. Despite having the top-two leading run-getters of the season in skipper Rahul (387 runs) and Mayank Agarwal (337), KXIP have failed in getting wins.Barring the duo, the other KXIP batters have failed to click and lack of an all-round effort has been clearly visible. Same is the condition of the bowling attack as except Mohammad Shami and Ravi Bishnoi, the others have been off-colour.However, KXIP can draw some confidence from the fact their solitary win in ongoing season had come against RCB.Moreover, Chris Gayle, who has warmed the bench in the previous games, is likely to get a game on Thursday.Looking at the perfect batting conditions here, Gayle could create an absolute carnage but remains to be seen how quickly the self-proclaimed 'Universe Boss' gets into the act.The KXIP think-tank might axe an out-of-form Glenn Maxwell in order to accommodate Gayle.Chris Gayle Back in Training After Recovering From Stomach BugRCB, which stand at the third place in points table with 10 points in their kitty, will aim to consolidate their position in the table.The RCB top-order comprising Aaron Finch, Devdutt Padikkal, Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers are in good touch and can destroy even the best bowling attack.Similarly, their bowlers have also stepped up whenever the team needed. The arrival of Chris Morris has further boosted the pace attack and the South African all-rounder can also prove to be handy with the bat if needed.Isuru Udana too has also been decent with the ball while Yuzvendra Chahal and Washington Sundar have executed their plans perfectly, creating trouble for the opposition batters.While Kohli and Co will look to avenge their last defeat, KXIP will certainly aim to spoil the party and in such a case, another thrilling contest is likely to be witnessed at a batting-friendly Sharjah wicket.

The special public prosecutor had argued that Kasim is a ‘Bad Character’ of the area and there are 10 cases against him due to which the constables knew Kasim and were able to identify him.                                                                                                                                                                                  The injured person who identified some of the rioters, including Kasim, stated that he was near Mr. Hussain’s house around 4 p.m. on February 25 and saw an angry mob on the terrace pelting stones, firing guns, throwing petrol bombs, and chanting communal slogans. During the violence, the person was allegedly shot in his shoulder.                                                                                                                                                                                   Around 4:00 pm, he came out of his house to purchase some household articles and when he reached near Lakhpat School, Chand Bagh, he found that riots broke out in the whole area.                                                                                                                                                                                  When he reached near Tahir Hussain’s house, he saw angry mob on the terrace of the said house, who were pelting stones, firing gun shots and throwing petrol bombs upon the houses of Hindu community.

When the HC asked the police about Kasim’s phone location, the special public prosecutor stated that Kasim’s phone was not in ‘active mode’ from February 17 to March 23 so phone location could not be done.                                                                                                                                                                                   “Without commenting on the merits of the case and in view of the aforesaid facts, this court is inclined to grant bail to the petitioner,” the High Court stated.

 The biopic will retell the "story for the first time through women's eyes, both behind and in front of the camera," Gadot tweeted.
 "Wonder Woman" director Patty Jenkins is on board, as is "Shutter Island" writer Laeta Kalogridis.
 But the announcement immediately prompted social media criticism of the white, Israel-born star's casting as an African queen.
 "Hollywood has always cast white American actresses as the Queen of the Nile. For once, can't they find an African actress?" tweeted author James Hall.
 The furor taps into wider criticism of Hollywood's history of casting white actors in non-white roles on the apparent assumption of higher box office appeal, a practice commonly referred to as "whitewashing."
 However, other social media users quickly noted that Cleopatra herself -- a 1st-century BC ruler descended from Alexander the Great's general Ptolemy -- was of Greek heritage, and may have been white.
 "Incredibly excited to get the chance to tell the story of Cleopatra, my favorite Ptolemaic Pharoah (sic) and arguably the most famous Macedonian Greek woman in history," tweeted Kalogridis, who will also executive produce the film and is of Greek heritage.
 Gadot, who has not commented on the row, retweeted the comment.
 Others accused the backlash against Gadot's casting of leaning on anti-Semitic tropes. Several social media users had drawn attention to Gadot's mandatory service in Israel's military.
 Gadot is no stranger to online criticism, having faced widespread mockery in March for spearheading a video montage of celebrities singing "Imagine" from their sprawling homes.
 The video, intended to provide hope for those affected by the Covid lockdown, was slammed as being out of touch with the lives of everyday people.
 Gadot's "Wonder Woman 1984" is due in theaters this December, although some analysts predict its release date could follow multiple other blockbusters in shifting to next year.

Lindsey Graham's days as a U.S. Senator from South Carolina could very well be numbered, as hard as that would have been to believe a few years ago. He seems to know he's out and recently pleaded with Fox News viewers to send him campaign donations. That spectacle was followed by his Democratic opponent, Jamie Harrison, raising $57 million (and in the process, breaking a congressional fundraising record) in an effort to unseat Graham, who's been under fire for his (arguably hypocritical) tactics to fill Ruth Bader Ginsberg's Supreme Court seat so swiftly and before the election.

"He has experienced no symptoms," Sidney said. "For the time being, the secretary will work from home while continuing to carry out the mission of the department and the president's agenda."
 The JWF event was held 17 days after the White House gathering – beyond the two-week point that the virus can incubate before symptoms appear – although Sabin said he was unable to say when Scalia's wife's latest tests were conducted.
 Scalia has been a touring Pennsylvania on behalf of Trump with the state pinpointed as a potential decider for the Nov. 3 election.
 Trump announced on Oct. 2 that he and first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19. He was treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
 How Trump's administration has handled the virus has been a hot-button issue on the campaign trail. Scalia is a member of Trump's Coronavirus Task Force, which was assembled earlier in the year to coordinate efforts to minimize the spread of the virus.
 During his Tuesday visit, Scalia addressed approximately 40 JWF workers, heralding their ability to keep fulfilling defense contract orders for the military's Ground Mobility Vehicle and other armored trucks during the pandemic.
 The Labor secretary wore a mask while other officials spoke to the press at a podium. But he removed it other times, including during a posed photo alongside dozens of JWF officials and employees.
 Surrounded by JWF executives Bill and John Polacek and rows of welders in light blue JWF masks, only Scalia and U.S. Rep John Joyce stood for the photo without face coverings.
 It was one of at least two group photos – one before the event and another after – with Scalia later donning his mask for TV cameras while standing underneath a banner that read "Faith. Family. Country."
