The University of Kentucky football team hit the ground running Tuesday.
 At their first official practice of the 2020 season, the Wildcats were finally able to get back on the field together for a few hours.
 According to UK head coach Mark Stoops, having the chance to practice felt like a reward for his players after spending the last several months working out and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “We’re excited about just getting started,” Stoops said during a Zoom teleconference Tuesday. “Our players have worked really hard this summer.
 “To date, our players have done everything we’ve asked them to do. They’ve worked exceptionally hard, they want more, they want to practice, they want to play. ... We will see where it goes from there.”
 According to senior running back A.J. Rose, it was a return to familiarity.
 “It was great to be back out there with all the guys,” he said. “It was weird having these masks on and trying to be socially distant out on the field ... but we are glad to be back and getting ready for Sept. 26.”
 Stoops and UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart have urged players to speak up if they have any concerns or hesitations about competing during the pandemic, but Stoops said Tuesday that nobody has opted out of the 2020 season just yet.
 It’s “nowhere near a normal fall camp,” Rose added, but opting out was never a thought in his mind.
 “It’s my last year here with the guys,” he said. “If we’re going to have a season, I was going to play regardless. That was never in my head. Going forward, I’m glad that we have a season and we can play.”
 Senior quarterback Terry Wilson, who returns after missing most of last season with a torn patellar tendon, had to think about his family — his girlfriend and a baby daughter on the way — before ultimately deciding to play.
 “Everybody on this team has worked hard every day, and we worked hard all summer,” he said. “I wanted to be around them and come back and finish strong with my guys.”
 Instead of anyone opting out, Stoops saw a veteran group ready to get back to football — a potential building block as the team begins practice during what he called “unprecedented times.”
 “I’d like to believe it helps,” Stoops said of his squad’s experience. “We’ve worked hard for the past seven years at developing leadership throughout our program. This is another example of an organization, a program, that I want to be player-led.”
 “This group of guys that are older have certainly set the tone, and hopefully that will continue to trickle down to the rest of our team. It does help that we have a veteran group and they’re anxious to play.”
 Having that kind of continuity can only help as UK heads into its 10-game conference-only schedule for 2020, Stoops continued, especially if crowd sizes are limited for health and safety reasons.
 “It’ll be different, there’s no question about that,” he said. “How it affects it one way or the other, we have no idea until we get into it and get playing.
 “We’re guaranteed 10 opportunities at this point, and we’re going to work around the clock and have relentless pursuit to have our team prepared each and every week.”
 As far as what UK expects when the SEC slate kicks off Sept. 26, the Cats hope a deep bench will help them improve on their 3-5 conference mark from a year ago. UK opens its season at Auburn.
 “I do feel like this is the deepest team since I’ve been here,” Stoops said. “We are a deep team with some experience — that has to help when you’re playing 10 conference games, because we all know how difficult that’ll be. It’ll be a real challenge, but we do have a deep team and a mature team. That has to help us.”
 More so than anything, though, Wilson just wants the Wildcats to appreciate being back at practice — especially since the Big Ten and Pac-12, among other conferences, have already postponed any sort of fall football activity.
 “We’re blessed, we’re really blessed to be able to continue doing this, to be able to come to practice and do what we love,” he said. “That’s what’s driving us the most — knowing that we’re some of the only guys who get to come out and do football things.
 “It doesn’t get any better than this. I feel like everybody wants to play football right now, but we’re fortunate enough to be out there taking advantage of it.”

 He’s been fascinated with shoes his whole life. The extra spending money he earned with his first high school job went toward building his sneaker collection.
 Sketching the shoes in his collection led to Mayhew coming up with his own designs — a first step in fulfilling his desire to be a footwear designer.
 “The right pair of shoes can make or break an outfit,” he said. “There’s something about well-designed shoes that demand one’s eye. People, whether they’re sneaker-heads or not, notice a cool pair of kicks.”

Two Leaders Under Fire for Touting Unproven COVID-19 'Preventatives'


--DocBreak--
Related to trout fishing, the Commission reminds anglers to take summer weather conditions into consideration when enjoying local waterways. In many cases during very hot and dry conditions, trout will seek out the closest source of cold water to provide thermal relief. This often results in many trout congregating at the mouths of cool-water tributaries or spring seeps. The Commission asks anglers to consider that while crowded and thermally stressed trout in a pool of water may look like an easy target, these fish are typically in poor condition and difficult to catch. Anglers should avoid fishing for trout during these conditions, as it can have lasting impacts on the population.
 In Huntingdon County, Commissioners approved the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend fishing regulations at Whipple Lake. Under the proposal, the 22-acre impoundment owned by the PA DCNR, located within Whipple Dam State Park, would be regulated under Miscellaneous Special Regulations allowing for harvest of trout but catch and release for all other species. Whipple Lake was drawn down in 2019 for dam structure improvements and sediment removal. With construction nearing completion, the Commission plans to initiate stocking the lake in spring 2021, or as soon as refilling conditions allow, with adult trout and fingerling plants of select fish species to establish a high-quality warm-water and cool-water fishery. This regulation would allow for the Commission to open the lake to fishing immediately upon refill under a special regulation that will allow for the harvest of trout under Commonwealth Inland Waters angling regulations but allow only catch-and-release fishing for all other fish species. Once the warm-water fishery is re-established, the lake will be recommended for removal from the Miscellaneous Special Regulation and inclusion in one of the Commission’s existing warm-water regulation programs. If approved on final rulemaking at a future meeting, the amendment will go into effect upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.
 Also, in Huntingdon County, Commissioners approved the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend fishing regulations at Lake Perez. Under the proposal, Lake Perez, a 72-acre impoundment owned by the Pennsylvania State University, would be removed from the list of waters managed under Miscellaneous Special Regulations allowing for the harvest of trout but catch and release for all other species. These special regulations have been in place since 2015, when a dam reconstruction project was completed at Lake Perez, and the lake was refilled and restocked and following a complete drawdown. PFBC surveys of the lake during 2019 and 2020 have revealed that warmwater species, including bass and panfish, have become abundant enough to sustain limited harvest. If the Miscellaneous Special Regulation is removed on final rulemaking, Lake Perez will be recommended for addition to the Panfish Enhancement program. All other species will be managed with Commonwealth Inland Waters angling regulations. If approved on final rulemaking at a future meeting, the amendment will go into effect upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.
 In Cumberland County, the Board approved the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend fishing regulations at Opossum Lake. Under the proposal, Opossum Lake, a 47-acre impoundment owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and managed by the PFBC, would be removed from the list of waters managed under Miscellaneous Special Regulations allowing for the harvest of trout but catch and release for all other species. These special regulations have been in place since 2012, when a dam reconstruction project was completed at Opossum Lake, and the lake was refilled and restocked following a complete drawdown. PFBC surveys of the lake from 2015-2020 have revealed that warmwater species, including bass and panfish, have become abundant enough to sustain limited harvest. If the Miscellaneous Special Regulation is removed on final rulemaking, Opossum Lake will be recommended for addition to the Big Bass and Panfish Enhancement programs. All other species will be managed with Commonwealth Inland Waters angling regulations. If approved on final rulemaking at a future meeting, the amendment will go into effect upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.
 The Board approved the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking pertaining to boating and waterskiing regulations at Blue Marsh Lake in Berks County. This 1,148-acre flood control project managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is a busy boating destination regulated by Title 58 of the Pennsylvania Code, specifically Section 111.6, Berks County. Blue Marsh Lake has three specific regulations that deviate from the statewide recreational boating regulations regarding exhausts, no wake zones, and water- skiers. Specifically, subsection (3) states that “a boat may not tow more than one water-skier.” This limitation deviates from the standard utilized throughout the Commonwealth where the number of skiers is determined by the boat’s persons capacity. Recently USACE leadership has changed their local policy/regulation adopting the standard skiing regulation. They have petitioned the Commission to make the same change in Title 58 so Waterways Conservation Officers can continue to assist in enforcement. If adopted on final rulemaking at a future meeting, this amendment would go into effect upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.
 In similar action, Commissioners approved the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking pertaining to boating regulations at Shenango River Lake in Mercer County. This 3,560-acre flood control project managed by the USACE has several boating regulations in place that vary from those enforced within Title 58 of the Pennsylvania Code. Specifically, subsection (1) states that “the use of motors in excess of 10 horsepower are prohibited in the area west of the Penn Central Railroad (Levittsburg) causeway to the Ohio line.” Recently USACE leadership has changed their local policy/regulation adopting a 20- horsepower restriction west of the causeway. They have petitioned the Commission to make the same change to Title 58 so Waterways Conservation Officers can continue to assist in enforcement. The proposed amendment was approved by the Boating Advisory Board at their June 23, 2020 meeting. If adopted on final rulemaking at a future Commission meeting, this amendment would go into effect upon publication in the Pennsylvania Bulletin.
 The Board adopted a resolution commending the efforts of PFBC staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. The resolution recognized the perseverance and teamwork of agency employees amid the challenges presented by the pandemic, including continuing to provide Pennsylvanians with safe, enjoyable outdoor recreation opportunities that greatly benefit mental and physical health during a time of considerable stress and uncertainty. The resolution also commended PFBC staff for completing annual spring stocking operations within hundreds of Pennsylvania waterways without the assistance of community volunteers due to ongoing public health concerns.
 PFBC Bureau of Law Enforcement Director Col. Corey Britcher provided the Board with a report related to enhanced Boating Under the Influence (BUI) enforcement surrounding the Independence Day holiday weekend. Britcher reported that from July 3-5, PFBC Waterways Conservation Officers (WCO) participated in Operation Dry Water, a nationally coordinated effort between to law enforcement agencies to prevent boating incidents related to impairment. Throughout the operations in Pennsylvania, WCOs and other officers came into contact with 2,490 boats, resulting in 298 boating infractions, 1,224 warnings, and 14 BUI arrests. One of the arrests was due to drug-related impairment. The highest recorded blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) was .237. Britcher noted that prior to the enhanced BUI enforcement period, the PFBC led a statewide media campaign to alert the public and stress the importance of staying sober while operating watercraft.
 In his report to the Board, Executive Director Schaeffer also stressed the importance of boating safety education. Schaeffer indicated that seven boating related fatalities have already occurred during 2020, and none of the victims were wearing life jackets. Schaeffer mentioned that sales of PFBC launch permits for unpowered boats such as kayaks, canoes, and paddleboards, have increased by approximately 50% amid the COVID-19 pandemic. With more new boaters on the water this season, Schaeffer urged the public to become familiar with basis boating safety steps, including wearing a life jacket, having a float plan, never drinking under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and monitoring weather conditions to avoid storms and high-water conditions.
 The next meeting of the PFBC Board of Commissioners is scheduled for October 19-20, 2020 in at PFBC Headquarters located at 1601 Elmerton Avenue, Harrisburg, PA. If an in-person meeting is not possible due to continued public health concerns, information regarding a virtual meeting will be announced later.

August 11, 1960 - August 5, 2020 Cindy Badell-Slaughter passed away in the early morning of August 5th at the age of 59 after a courageous battle with lung cancer.Cindy was born on August 11, 1960 in New York City and grew up in Bethesda, MD. After graduating from high school, she spent a year in England at the Hartwell House, a very prestigious women's business school. After coming back to the States, she moved out to California with a close friend to start their new adventure. Cindy always had a love for music and quickly found her niche. She started in the music licensing industry in the mid-1980s at Lorimar Productions, which was later bought out by Warner Bros., working on shows such as Dallas, Knots Landing, Falcon Crest, Full House, and Perfect Strangers. She moved on to be Director of Music Clearance for Evan M. Greenspan, handling their many syndicated and prime time series, feature films, and on-air promotion for Fox. She spent the next 10 years at CBS Television as Director of Music Operations West Coast, overseeing shows such as Touched by an Angel, Promised Land, Survivor, the CSI series, as well as movies for television, mini-series and on-air promotion for CBS and UPN. In October 2007, she and her husband acquired Heavy Hitters Music, an independent song catalog and music publisher serving the film, television and advertising industry. As president of the company she grew the business significantly by nurturing relationships with their artists and clients. Everyone in the business of licensing music knew and admired her. In an industry that can be unforgiving, she was a stand up professional who spread kindness and encouragement to all.Cindy's passion for music, working with artists, and the film and television music industry was matched only by her dedication to working with youth and mentoring the next generation in the music industry. She was also a highly dedicated and active member of Glendale's Church of the Brethren, a community she deeply loved. Cindy's faith was very strong. She is one with God now. This is just a comma in her life, not a period. She met her husband Bill in 1990 and married on February 13, 1993. They settled in Glendale. They had a wonderful life together with family and friends. They traveled the world together and spent a lot of time at their 2nd home in Cabo San Lucas. Cindy was the glue of the family, always making the plans for get togethers, especially holidays and birthdays. She was a gatherer and builder of human beings; a beautiful, kind and giving soul. She encouraged others to live every day as if it were the best day. She filled the world with a beautiful smile and a sweet spirit. Her last Facebook posts were about remembering all the fun times with good friends, celebrating her dear cat's birthday, and challenging people to donate to a cause. Family, friends and giving; that was the essence of this beautiful woman. She is survived by her husband Bill, her brother Philip, her dear Auntie Laurette, along with many nephews, nieces and cousins whom she loved and adored. A private funeral service is being scheduled in New York where she will be laid to rest with her family. A celebration of life event will be held at a later date when her life can be safely celebrated. In lieu of flowers, donations can be sent to Reaching Youth Through Music Opportunities www.rytmo.org/donate , an organization she cared deeply about.

“I was ahead in the first set, and in the second set I was kind of off to a bad start,” DeAngelis said. “(Cook) told me to go back to my backhand and try some drop shots, and that worked really well.”
 For Mellino, simply being able to start the season was enough for one day.
 “We were on and then we were off, and I didn’t really know what I was going to do (if the season was shut down),” Mellino said. “But today’s very exciting. I’m very happy, looking forward to the rest of the season.”
 Eagles coach Eric Hodge, now in his 21st year, has a lot of youth on his roster coming off of a fifth place finish in the SWC in 2019. Mellino is the team’s only senior.
 Due to COVID uncertainty, numbers are down this year for a program that usually hovers around 20 girls. This year’s team has 11.
 Also hurting the Eagles early on in the season is that they only recently were allowed to return to practice. The North Olmsted City School District followed the advice of the Cuyahoga County Board of Health just before the season’s official Aug. 1 start and postponed all extracurricular activities before allowing sports to resume Aug. 5.
 “It hasn’t even sunk in that we actually played the match,” Hodge said. “I don’t think we as coaches were expecting to be here today to play our first match. I think every girl out here was on cloud nine that they actually got to play a match.”

 After weeks of uncertainty about who will replace Dr Kizza Besigye as the FDC flag bearer in the next year’s presidential elections, three top leaders of the main Opposition party in the country have decided to run for party flag.
 The FDC chairperson, Mr Wasswa Biriggwa, picked expression of interest forms yesterday and marketed himself a leader with energy to mend the broken hearts of Ugandans who are currently disunited.
 The party president, Mr Patrick Oboi Amuriat, and the party secretary general, Mr Nandala Mafabi, confirmed that they will be picking nomination forms today to take on Mr Biriggwa in what is shaping up into a three-horse race. However, more people are expected to pick papers since nomination window closes today.
 The three FDC big wigs seek to replace Dr Besigye who has opted not to contest after holding the party flag in the previous four presidential elections.
 Dr Besigye, who is slated to return the party flag today, is also slated to give a keynote speak addresses and outline reasons why this time he is not contesting against President Museveni. Attempts by FDC leaders to persuade Dr Besigye to contest for the firth time were futile.
 To some disillusioned voters, Mr Biriggwa said it is important they rejuvenate their efforts.

So what does the recession mean for movers? Not a lot at the moment, according to local agents. In fact, Putterills think calling it a mini boom is downplaying what they say should rightly be referred to as a maxi boom.
 Managing director Mark Shearing said the company had notched up record levels of sales in their offices across Herts since lockdown restrictions were loosened, and news of a recession doesn’t seem to be deterring buyers so far. “Our phones have been practically ringing off the hook and the numbers of visitors to our website and social media pages have skyrocketed,” he said.
 Our Secret Estate Agent agrees that the recession is having no effect on the current “white hot” St Albans market, and it’s a similar story from Rightmove, which has recorded the most sales agreed in a month in over a decade of tracking this data, up by 38 per cent on a year ago.
 Another consequence of COVID is the rise of the staycation, meaning many of us are able to prioritise house hunting ahead of lounging about somewhere sunny - thus avoiding the usual summer slowdown. A down side of all this is that even agents don’t seem sure how to value properties in such an ever-changing market, with countless local examples of very similar homes being marketed at wildly different prices.

The Secret Estate Agent calls the current market a "moving target" and says comparable properties that have already sold are now obsolete due to the speed at which market conditions are changing, hence agents' issues with consistent pricing. And while many of these properties are under offer within a week, others are hanging around long after their asking prices have been slashed. So what's a buyer to do? Well, offer what you think it's worth and you can't go wrong, right...?

If social distancing was helpful then, it would have been made easier by the fact that absenteeism in schools soared during the pandemic, perhaps because of what one Chicago public health official called "fluphobia" among parents.
 "The absentee rate was so great, it really didn't matter" that schools were open, Markel said.
 Part of Chicago's strategy was to ensure that fresh air was circulated. School rooms were overheated during the winter so that windows could remain open at all times, according to a 1918 paper by the Chicago Department of Health.
 The paper concluded that an analysis of data showed that "the decision of keeping the schools of this city open during the recent influenza epidemic was justified."
 And in New York, then Health Commissioner Copeland told the New York Times: "How much better it has been to have the children under the constant observation of qualified persons than to close the schools."
 Markel, who with other researchers pored over data and historical records in looking at the response of 43 cities to the 1918 pandemic, isn't as convinced.
 New York "didn't do the worst, but it didn't do the best, either," Markel said, adding Chicago was slightly better.
 Research showed that cities who implemented quarantining and isolation, school closures and bans on public gatherings fared the best, he said.
 "The cities that did more than one" of these measures "did better. School closures were part of that contribution," Markel said.
 Public health experts, including Markel, are quick to point out that Covid-19 is not influenza, which was a well-known disease in 1918. There is still a lot to learn about the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19.
 The right decision today, Markel said, is school closure.
 "It's better," he said, "to be safe than sorry."

Such is the nature of trap shooting, one of the nation’s fastest-growing high school sports. North Ridgeville, the only team of its kind in the region, features some of the best marksmen–regardless of age or gender–in the state.
 “The coaches were very generous (the first time I came out) and let me use a dedicated trap gun, and I did decently for my first time,” said Hogue, who’s only prior experience was shooting his father’s shotgun at a still target before his eighth grade year. “I was just kind of hooked from there. As soon as you crest the little hill on the way in (to the range), the worries of the world melt away and you can just focus on the clays.”
 The Rangers program, created by Cleveland Clinic doctor Grant Comnick in 2017 after he saw a team operate during a trip to Minnesota with his son, Isaiah, has become a state powerhouse in the years since, attracting an increasing number of students in grades 8-12 and racking up victories while playing two seasons per year–one in the fall and another in the spring. The team has grown thanks to a combination of word of mouth and advertising in and around the school.
 They compete in the Ohio State High School Clay Target League, consisting of 15 schools, and have three consecutive first-place finishes, the most recent coming in July. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the spring schedule being moved to the summer, and some schools opted not to participate. The state championship, annually held in Columbus, was canceled.
 Just 10 years ago, there were a total of 13 teams, all in Minnesota, that comprised the sport’s national body, the USA Clay Target League. As of 2019, 25 states had trap teams, with more than 1,000 teams and 30,000 students participating.
 “I started with just me and my son, then got approval from the school (to start a team),” said Comnick, who also serves as a coach and administrator for the program. “Then we had to get the word out there. You have to have five kids to start a team, and we ended up with 19. We’ve just gotten lots of interest.”
 With the 2020 fall season set to begin Sept. 14, the Rangers marksmen have been hard at work preparing, showing improvement at a sport that takes a lot of patience, as well as a lot of ammo, to master.
 “I probably practice out here about six hours a week”, said sophomore Vanessa Donato, who took up trap shooting in eighth grade. “It probably takes about 1,000 shots (to feel comfortable). I know that sounds like a lot, but it honestly isn’t. After awhile you just get used to it, and the more you shoot the better you’ll get.”
 The Ranger roster is young, with many of the team’s top shooters entering the year as sophomores or younger. And experience varies.

 # Peach festival another victim to COVID-19
 Amanda Parrish
 Middletown Transcript
 MIDDLETOWN -- For more than 20 years, hundreds of people have filled Main Street for the Middletown Historical Society’s Olde-Tyme Peach Festival in August to celebrate the town’s history and mark the end of summer. Patrons will have to wait until at least 2021 to get their peaches.
 The Peach Festival that was scheduled for Saturday, Aug. 15 was canceled in May due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, with hopes of selling peaches, peach desserts and T-shirts throughout August.
 But that won’t happen either. Brian Rickards, festival chairman, said he was looking into other ways to celebrate the festival, including a smaller event at the Historical Society building, but the ever-changing landscape of the pandemic made trying to plan something difficult.
 “It was very upsetting that we had to pull the plug,” he said. “We were trying [to plan an event] up until about three weeks ago, but then we realized there was no way we were going to be able to do it.”
 David Matsen, historical society chairman, said in an email it was a difficult decision for the Peach Festival leaders.
 “When this year's festival was called off, it had become apparent that keeping the vendors, entertainers, parade and town on hold was not an option,” he said.
 Rickards said they had sold out most of Main Street and part of Cass Street to vendors by the beginning of March. A few weeks later, the pandemic hit.
 “[I’m glad] we didn’t say, ‘Let's do it,’ because we still can't do it. What I didn't want was to come up to the day or couple weeks prior and cancel it,” he said. “Vendors do all of their bookings for the summer late in March, and they are feeling the pain too.”
 The festival has been a family day of entertainment focused on the fruit that farmers in and around Middletown grew in the 1800s that made the town prosper.
 “This is usually the big festival before kids start going back to school. Everyone sees their friends and neighbors who they haven't seen. I am sure people are very upset [with the cancellation,” he said. “Everyone understands it was a decision that had to be made. It's for the safety of everybody.”
 Rickards said the cancellation is a lost opportunity for them to recruit new volunteers for the next year.
 There is no plan to hold the 2020 festival at a later date, Rickards said, because of the months of planning needed. He said they normally start planning the August festival in either December or January.
 “There is also talk that there won't be one next year, depending on what goes on,” he said.
 Although it’s one of the largest events the historical society puts on, it doesn’t support the organization financially. Rickards said the revenue from the festival supports the budget for putting on the event every year.

 # Whether you are a night owl or early bird may affect how much you move
 By Gretchen Reynolds
 The New York Times |
 Aug 18, 2020  at 12:28 PM
 People who are evening types go to bed later and wake up later than morning types. They also tend to move around far less throughout the day, according to a new study of how our innate body clocks may be linked to our physical activity habits. The study, one of the first to objectively track daily movements of a large sample of early birds and night owls, suggests that knowing our chronotype might be important for our health.
 In recent years, a wealth of new science has begun explicating the complex roles of cellular clocks and chronotypes in our health and lifestyles. Thanks to this research, we know that each of us contains a master internal body clock, located in our brains, that tracks and absorbs outside clues, such as ambient light, to determine what time it is and how our bodies should react. This master clock directs the rhythmic release of hormones, such as melatonin, and other chemicals that affect sleep, wakefulness, hunger and many other physiological systems.

 # Maney advances to general election bid for state rep. seat
 Tony Judnich
 Republican Patt Maney will face Democrat John Plante and write-in candidate Lance Lawrence in the Nov. 3 general election as they each vie to serve as the next District 4 state representative.
 In Tuesday’s primary election, Maney received almost 38 % of the vote while topping challengers and fellow Republicans Jeff Hinkle, Jonathan Tallman and Sandra Atkinson.
 Hinkle received more than 34% of the vote to come in second, Tallman received more than 17% and Atkinson received more than 10%.
 Maney, who is an Army veteran and retired Okaloosa County Judge, will seek to replace Mel Ponder as the District 4 state rep.
 Ponder decided not to pursue re-election to that seat so he could run for the District 5 Okaloosa County Commission seat. According to Tuesday’s unofficial results, he squeezed past candidate and current Destin City Councilman Parker Destin to win the commission seat.
 “I’m very grateful for the win and for the confidence of the public,” Maney said of his primary election victory. “Of course, it’s only the first step, but I’m very hopeful we’ll do well” in the general election.
 “I’m going to take Northwest Florida values and Northwest Florida courtesy to Tallahassee,” he added.
 On Jan. 31, 2016, Maney became the longest serving county or circuit judge in Florida’s First Judicial Circuit. As state representative, he said he would work to pass a balanced state budget and then get the infrastructure in place to prepare the workforce for the 21st century.

August 11, 1960 - August 5, 2020 Cindy Badell-Slaughter passed away in the early morning of August 5th at the age of 59 after a courageous battle with lung cancer.Cindy was born on August 11, 1960 in New York City and grew up in Bethesda, MD. After graduating from high school, she spent a year in England at the Hartwell House, a very prestigious women's business school. After coming back to the States, she moved out to California with a close friend to start their new adventure. Cindy always had a love for music and quickly found her niche. She started in the music licensing industry in the mid-1980s at Lorimar Productions, which was later bought out by Warner Bros., working on shows such as Dallas, Knots Landing, Falcon Crest, Full House, and Perfect Strangers. She moved on to be Director of Music Clearance for Evan M. Greenspan, handling their many syndicated and prime time series, feature films, and on-air promotion for Fox. She spent the next 10 years at CBS Television as Director of Music Operations West Coast, overseeing shows such as Touched by an Angel, Promised Land, Survivor, the CSI series, as well as movies for television, mini-series and on-air promotion for CBS and UPN. In October 2007, she and her husband acquired Heavy Hitters Music, an independent song catalog and music publisher serving the film, television and advertising industry. As president of the company she grew the business significantly by nurturing relationships with their artists and clients. Everyone in the business of licensing music knew and admired her. In an industry that can be unforgiving, she was a stand up professional who spread kindness and encouragement to all.Cindy's passion for music, working with artists, and the film and television music industry was matched only by her dedication to working with youth and mentoring the next generation in the music industry. She was also a highly dedicated and active member of Glendale's Church of the Brethren, a community she deeply loved. Cindy's faith was very strong. She is one with God now. This is just a comma in her life, not a period. She met her husband Bill in 1990 and married on February 13, 1993. They settled in Glendale. They had a wonderful life together with family and friends. They traveled the world together and spent a lot of time at their 2nd home in Cabo San Lucas. Cindy was the glue of the family, always making the plans for get togethers, especially holidays and birthdays. She was a gatherer and builder of human beings; a beautiful, kind and giving soul. She encouraged others to live every day as if it were the best day. She filled the world with a beautiful smile and a sweet spirit. Her last Facebook posts were about remembering all the fun times with good friends, celebrating her dear cat's birthday, and challenging people to donate to a cause. Family, friends and giving; that was the essence of this beautiful woman. She is survived by her husband Bill, her brother Philip, her dear Auntie Laurette, along with many nephews, nieces and cousins whom she loved and adored. A private funeral service is being scheduled in New York where she will be laid to rest with her family. A celebration of life event will be held at a later date when her life can be safely celebrated. In lieu of flowers, donations can be sent to Reaching Youth Through Music Opportunities www.rytmo.org/donate , an organization she cared deeply about.

In normal times, walking into a bathroom, looking down at an odd dark spot on the tile floor and realizing that “spot” was a tiny green frog would have caused an epic meltdown. But these are not normal times. When I encountered said frog last week, I simply paused, calculated whether I was going to live- and-let-live with the slimy green creature and decided that answering nature’s call was more urgent than freaking out about, well, nature.
 The same could be said the following morning, when I turned on the shower in the same bathroom and had a panicked moth fly right into my face. I barely cringed.
