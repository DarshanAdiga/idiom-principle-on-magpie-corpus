In the last few years, global brands, from Apple and Coke to Nike, have all invested in Chinese New Year-specific marketing. Building campaigns around the festive season is not new. (While the top limited-edition products this year are from brands like Gucci, Burberry, and Disney, back in 1997, Häagen-Dazs took the Chinese market by storm with its ice cream-based spin on mooncakes.) But as WeChat demonstrated, the potential extends far beyond physical goods. In this post, we explore how major Chinese consumer apps are using AR, games, memes, and cash giveaways to celebrate the new year—and how US companies might follow suit.

"Spags has done a great job with that group," Reid said. "He has guys with him on the defensive side that he was familiar with. He'll be the first to tell you, that is such a big part of it. He didn't have to teach the coaches -- the coaches just hit the ground running and already knew what was expected of them. So the players go, 'Man, all these guys believe this, they can teach it, they're all tied in.' With that, there was a confidence that was built in. Even when things start off slow, the guys are going, 'We're this close to turning things around again to the way we want it.' And they just keep at it."

So far, around 50 businesses have registered for the fair, according to executive director Connie Kreikemeier. She said the fair gives employers a chance build a rapport with students.
 “It’s an opportunity to build employer brand on campus,” Kreikemeier said. “So many times when students think of organizations, they think of just one thing. This way, it broadens students idea of what organizations need, whether it’s HR or communications or whatever it may be.”
 Last year, 400 students attended the fair, the highest turnout since the program was first introduced. Kreikemeier said while there is an opportunity for students to come out of the fair with a path to a full-time job or internship, the fair serves a more important purpose.
 “In the bigger scheme of things, it’s all about building relationships for down the road,” she said. “Getting them connected is a big thing. One thing I tell employers is when you get a chance to come and network with our students, you should.”
