Examining the character of a political leader is something that voters and candidates alike are always willing to do, in the name of determining whether or not a particular person should hold an office as important as that of President. While that exact office isn’t up for grabs in Rod Lurie’s _The Contender_ , it’s the role of the Vice President that’s looking to be filled. Though that distinction doesn’t lessen the ante, as the game at stake is pretty rough.

Not only does this research highlight the importance of getting quality sleep on a consistent basis, but it also suggests poor sleep and intrusive thoughts can become cyclical.
 "The onset of intrusive thoughts and emotional disturbances following bouts of poor sleep could create a vicious cycle, whereby upsetting intrusions and emotional distress exacerbate sleep problems, inhibiting the sleep needed to support recovery," says senior author of the study, Scott Cairney, Ph.D.
 All the more reason to focus on sleep hygiene, get to bed early, or take a sleep-promoting supplement—particularly if you suffer from unwanted thoughts or have a psychiatric condition like PTSD or depression.
 At the end of the day, there isn't one of us out there who can go without sleep and feel our best. And if you're experiencing negative or unwanted thoughts, catching up on your zzz's might be just what you're missing.

SOUTHBOROUGH -- While an alleged drug dealer remains on the run, police announced they have received more than $11,500 in forfeiture money from the arrest.
 The funds represent half of the money Southborough police seized ($23,102) on Jan. 5 while arresting Adonis Ruiz, 26, of Mattapan, according to a press release.
 The Worcester District Attorney's Office had a hearing in Worcester Superior Court recently to get the money released. The money was available because it represented a drug forfeiture. However, the suspect, Ruiz, has been on the run since shortly after his arrest, necessitating the hearing.
 The other half of the money goes to the District Attorney's Office and will be used for education, prevention, investigation and prosecution of drug-related cases.
 According to state law, police must deposit the money into a special trust fund. It can be used to "defray" the costs of long investigations; purchase technical equipment or training; or to provide matching funds for federal grants.
 The money cannot be considered a source of revenue to be used for standard operating needs of a department.
 On Jan. 5, Southborough police pulled over Ruiz's SUV over on Rte. 9 because of an expired inspection sticker. Ruiz had a suspended license and officers took him into custody.
 Police conducted an inventory search and found a "large amount" of marijuana, marijuana edibles and marijuana oils, as well as the money.
 After Ruiz was arrested, he posted $5,000 bail but skipped out on his arraignment at Westborough District Court. He has not been seen since, and there is a warrant for his arrest, police said in the press release.

When LBC's Iain Dale asked Pastor Mark Burns what he was hoping would happen during the US Election the instant reply was a "landslide" for the sitting US President.
 He said it was a "build-up to two years of working behind the scenes and getting the message of President Trump to the people."
 He said the campaign was about "reminding the people we have a champion in the White House."
 Earlier on Tuesday US President Donald Trump and Joe Biden handed their fate to voters, who will decide which man will steer the country through the surging pandemic that has killed more than 231,000 people, destroyed jobs and reshaped nearly every aspect of American life.
 With almost 102 million Americans voting early and millions more waiting in lines on election day, the rancorous campaign across a polarised nation clearly struck a nerve with the electorate.
 But the Pastor also said that what Donald Trump had said he would do "he has done."
 Mr Burns said the sitting US President has "put three Supreme Court Justices on the bench," adding this would mean "hopefully we can overturn Roe V. Wade."
 "To make it illegal or put more restrictions on killing innocent unborn babies."

WASHINGTON — Control of the Senate is a razor-close proposition in Tuesday's election, as Republicans fight to retain their majority against a surge of Democratic candidates confronting the president's allies across a vast political map.
 Both parties see paths to victory, and the outcome might not be known on election night.
 From New England to the Deep South, the Midwest to the Mountain West, Republican senators are defending seats in states once considered long shots for Democrats. Washington’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis, the economic fallout and the nation's uneasy mood are all on the ballot. Stunning amounts of cash have been flowing to Democrats from millions of Americans apparently voting with their pocketbooks; Republicans are tapping deep-pocketed donors to shore up GOP senators.
 President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden swooped in on key states important to the Senate as they propelled their own campaigns in a final stretch.
 Securing the Senate majority will be vital for the winner of the presidency. Senators confirm administration nominees, including the Cabinet, and can propel or stall the White House agenda. With Republicans now controlling the chamber, 53-47, three or four seats will determine party control, depending on who wins the presidency because the vice president can break a tie.
 “Let’s run through the tape,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, making a final campaign swing Monday in Kentucky as he faces Democratic former fighter pilot Amy McGrath.
 McConnell said he hoped to remain the Republican majority leader alongside Trump. But he acknowledged the tough Senate races could flip control to the Democrats. “Obviously, that depends on what happens,” he said.
 The campaigns are competing across an expansive Senate map as Democrats put Republicans on defense deep into Trump country.
 What started as a lopsided election cycle with Republicans defending 23 Senate seats, compared with 12 for Democrats, quickly became a starker referendum on the president and his party.
 Some of the nation’s most well-known senators are in the fights of their political lives.
 In South Carolina, Democrat Jaime Harrison is trying to topple GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president's top allies.
 The two crisscrossed the state in a rush of final campaigning, Graham acknowledging the tight contest after Harrison raised a whopping $100 million by October, an unheard-of sum for the state. The senator, making TV appeals for cash, said he, too, hit the $100 million mark over the weekend.
 Stuck in Washington to confirm Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett a week before Election Day, senators quickly fanned out — some alongside the president — for last-ditch tours, often socially distanced in the pandemic, to shore up votes.
 GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina joined Trump’s rally in Fayetteville on Monday as he struggled to fend off Democrat Cal Cunningham despite the married challenger’s sexting scandal with a public relations strategist.
 In one of the most-watched races in the nation, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins made a final campaign stop in Aroostook County near her hometown, visiting workers in a sawmill. Democratic challenger Sara Gideon met voters at the Whistle Stop cafe for breakfast Monday.
 The Maine race is one of several that could push past Election Day if no candidate breaks the 50% threshold. Collins has typically rallied support as a centrist with an independent streak, but the tight contest shows the difficulty GOP senators have appealing to Trump's most ardent backers while also retaining support from more moderate voters.
 Democrats have more than one route to secure the three or four seats needed to capture the majority, and GOP strategists privately conceded the incumbents will almost certainly suffer defeats in some key races.
 Younger voters and more minorities are pushing some states toward Democrats. In Colorado, the parties have essentially stopped spending money for or against GOP Sen. Cory Gardner because it seems he is heading toward defeat by Democrat John Hickenlooper, a former governor.
 Arizona could see two Democratic senators for the first time since last century if former astronaut Mark Kelly maintains his advantage over GOP Sen. Martha McSally for the seat once held by the late Republican John McCain.
 Even the open seat in Kansas, which hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932, is being contested.
 “The better President Trump does in a state, the easier it is to win any race,” said Corry Bliss, a GOP strategist.
 The biggest risks to Democrats come in Alabama and Michigan.
 Republicans are expecting to reclaim the seat in Alabama, where Democratic Sen. Doug Jones pulled off a rare 2017 special election win in the Trump stronghold but now wages an uphill campaign against Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn football coach.
 In the presidential battleground of Michigan, Republicans have made an aggressive push for John James, a Black Republican businessman, as he rakes in cash to take on Democratic Sen. Gary Peters.
 “We think the numbers are moving,” said Senate Leadership Fund president Steven Law.
 Still, voter turnout during the COVID-19 crisis remains key, and volatile, as more Americans than ever — nearing 100 million — cast early ballots.
 Both Biden and Trump touched down in Georgia, where the state is seeing a boost of new voters. Georgia's two Senate seats are at stake and could very well push to a Jan. 5 runoff if no candidate reaches beyond the 50% threshold.
 GOP Sen. David Perdue, the former business executive Trump calls his favorite senator, is working to fend off Democrat Jon Ossoff, another candidate who has benefited from the “green wave” of donations.
 Separately, GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Republican Rep. Doug Collins, as well as Democrat Raphael Warnock, in a special election for the seat she was appointed to fill with the retirement of GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson.
 It’s expected to be a long count in races across the country.
 The political landscape is quickly changing from six years ago, when most of these senators last faced voters. It’s a reminder of how sharply the political climate has shifted in the Trump era.
 In Montana, Republican Sen. Steve Daines is trying to brush back Democrat Steve Bullock, the governor, in a state where Trump was popular. Democrats created an opening by working hard to recruit a well-known candidate in Bullock, who also ran in the party's primary for president.
 Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst is fighting for a second term against Democrat Theresa Greenfield. Texas Sen. John Cornyn faces an upstart Democrat, MJ Hegar, in the once solidly Republican state.
 And in Alaska, newcomer Al Gross, a doctor, has broken state fundraising records in part with viral campaign ads as he challenges GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan.

With Florida's death penalty law in limbo due to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Emilee Cope on Wednesday described in chilling detail how her father, Keith, was hog-tied and left for dead back in 2009 when she was a teenager.
 Cope recalled how her father suffered a stroke while he was left bound with rope and duct tape for days and then later died. She pleaded with state legislators to reject a proposal to require that juries unanimously recommend the death penalty because her own father's killer did not receive a unanimous recommendation. The role of juries in death cases has become the central focus of lawmakers scrambling to pass a bill that could help the state resume executions.
 But while legislators are hearing from the families of murder victims Gov. Rick Scott has remained mum.
 Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled nearly a month ago Scott has not made any recommendations and on Wednesday the governor said that he won't weigh in until state legislators send him a bill.
 "The Legislature has not gotten me a bill yet," said Scott, who has conducted the most executions under a single governor since the death penalty was reinstated in Florida in 1979. "When the Legislature gets me a bill I'll be glad to review it."
 Scott's decision to let legislators work out the details contrasts sharply with former Gov. Jeb Bush. After botched executions threatened Florida's death penalty, Bush called a special session in early 2000. The governor recommended changes that included the state's switch to lethal injection from the electric chair.
 The Legislature is tasked with rewriting how to sentence someone to death after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Jan. 12 that the current method is unconstitutional. The high court in an 8-1 ruling found that the state's sentencing procedure is flawed because it allows judges to reach a different decision than juries. Juries play only an advisory role in recommending death in Florida.
 The Florida Supreme Court last week delayed the pending execution of inmate Michael Lambrix after his attorneys argued that the ruling should apply to all 389 people on Florida's death row. Other judges across the state have also said they lack the authority to impose the death penalty in light of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
 Legislators have responded by quickly writing up a bill to overhaul the death penalty, but the House and Senate remain divided on what it takes for a jury to agree to the death penalty. The Senate bill requires a unanimous decision of all 12 jurors, but the House measure requires only nine. Current Florida law requires a simple majority of seven. Senators say they are pushing for the change to avoid future legal scrutiny of the state's death penalty.
 According to data compiled by the Florida Supreme Court's Clerk's office, only 69 of 330 death penalty cases- 21 percent - in the past 15 years had unanimous jury recommendations. Florida's prosecutors remain solidly opposed to requiring juries to reach a unanimous decision which is why Scott's position on the issue could wind up being crucial.
 "I think particularly given the veto pen it would be important for the governor to weigh in," said Rep. Jose Javier Rodriguez, a Miami Democrat who tried unsuccessfully to change the House proposal to mirror the Senate one.
 Before the vote Cope told legislators that her father's killer - Joseph Jordan - was sentenced to death in 2013 after a 10-2 jury recommendation. Jordan is currently imprisoned at Florida State Prison in north Florida.
 "The death penalty to me is equivalent to euthanizing an animal," Cope said. "They're given peace and they don't have to suffer anymore meanwhile my father suffered horribly and I wish he could have traded places with his defendant."
 This story has been changed from an earlier version to correct the first name of Emilee Cope.

America's fight over masks has reached a new front: polling places.
 On Election Day, voters across the country will face varying rules about mask- wearing when they cast a ballot as officials try to balance public safety precautions amid a global pandemic with the constitutional right to vote.
 Most states, even ones with broad mask mandates, are stopping short of forcing voters to use a face covering. Instead, they're opting for recommendations to wear them while providing options for voters who refuse.
 “We are asking everyone at the polls to observe social distancing inside and outside of polling places, and not to create disturbances about wearing or not wearing face coverings,” said Meagan Wolfe, chief elections official in Wisconsin, where a state mask mandate applies to poll workers but not voters.
 During the early voting period, disagreements over masks occasionally led to long voting lines and had election officials clearing polling sites for the mask-less or directing them to stations away from other machines.
 Still, due to the decentralized nature of the country's voting systems, rules are different depending on where ballots are cast. Some places are taking harder stances than others.
 In one case that caught national attention, a Maryland man was arrested after refusing to wear a mask while trying to vote last month. He has since sued his local election board over the incident.
 In Texas, the issue has wound up in court.
 First, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott carved out an exception for voting locations in his statewide mask mandate issued earlier this year. Then, in response to a challenge from voting rights groups, a federal judge ordered that masks must be worn inside polling sites. That decision was quickly reversed by an appeals court.
 Despite the legal back and forth, at least some Texas elections administrators had chosen not to enforce the short-lived polling station mask mandate.
 Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said governments should be able to require masks at polling places during the coronavirus pandemic.
 "Despite the few attempts to challenge mask requirements in court, there is no question that it is well within the legal authority of states and localities to require masks to be worn at polling places — both as a matter of public health and as a reasonable regulation of the election process,” she said.
 With Election Day looming, most places have settled on a strategy of strongly encouraging voters to wear masks. Their message is that abiding by widely accepted health guidelines will protect poll workers and other voters.
 In Atlanta, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms over the weekend signed an extension of measures designed to limit the spread of the virus, including a mask mandate in the city. But her order specifically says “no individual shall be denied ingress or egress to or from a polling place for failure to wear a facial covering or mask.”
 Gabriel Sterling, statewide voting system implementation manager for the secretary of state’s office, said during a news conference Monday that individual poll managers will have to decide how to accommodate people who have tested positive or are in quarantine. He suggested that one way to handle them might be pulling them aside and having them vote a hand-marked paper ballot away from everyone else, rather than having them use one of the touchscreen voting machines.
 But he stressed that no additional barriers to voting can be put in place.
 “You can’t turn away somebody because they’re not wearing a mask,” Sterling said.
 Meanwhile, election officials across the country have scrambled to shore up polling place safety precautions to make it easier to recruit poll workers. Many of them have traditionally been older retirees — the type of people who are at greater risk of getting a severe case of the coronavirus.
 The idea of staffing a polling place where voters aren't wearing masks was one reason Richard Baus decided to break over a decade of tradition and not work the election in his hometown of Dublin, Pennsylvania, this year. Even at 90-years-old during a global pandemic, Baus said he was considering returning as a poll worker but ultimately decided against it.
 “Being a poll worker, you do come into contact with people, very close contact,” he said. “I would have been more inclined to work if they had a mask mandate.”
 Virginia Elections Commissioner Chris Piper said voters who walk into polling places without wearing face coverings will be offered masks by poll workers. If they refuse to wear them, the voters will be asked to return to their cars and vote curbside. If they refuse to do that, they will be allowed to vote inside the polling location.
 “Obviously, the goal is to mitigate that, to encourage the health and safety of everybody," Piper said. "But certainly if they refuse, they have to be offered a ballot.”
 In Florida's Broward County, where there is a mask ordinance, elections spokesman Steve Vancore said just four out of 364,000 early voters refused to wear masks. They were allowed to cast ballots after they were separated from other voters.
 “We tell them ’Sir or ma’am – it is mostly sir – you are not supposed to be in here without a mask. There is a county ordinance,” he said. “They mostly obey.”

A capacity to target and control infection risks without disrupting social interaction more generally is a key theme for Africa as well as Europe. It is crucial to assessing how well Africa is prepared for a potential second wave. The prediction that Covid-19 would hit Africa even harder than Europe or North America, due to general levels of poverty and the inadequacies of health care, has not been borne out. Up until 12 October 2020 there have been just under 1.6 million cases of Covid-19 in Africa, with 38,396 deaths, with a large proportion of cases associated with just three countries - Egypt, Morocco and South Africa. For comparison, the fifteen countries of West Africa have experienced only 181,600 cases and 2,662 deaths. The figures for eastern Africa are similarly low. Perhaps because of a prompt response, or perhaps because of factors not yet fully appreciated, such as a greater proportion of activity taking place out of doors, African countries succeeded in damping an initial wave.

 "We are not going to control the pandemic," the White House chief of staff said on Oct. 25, admitting the Trump administration's failure to perform its most urgent job. This is timely, relevant information for Americans now going to the polls. But it's also terribly dangerous thinking. Even as the country waits to find out if there will be a change in leadership, the U.S. government can't simply give up trying to control COVID-19; far too many lives and livelihoods are at stake.
 Without strenuous efforts to monitor outbreaks by testing and tracing, and leadership to persuade people to take basic protective measures -- covering their faces, keeping their distance from others, washing their hands -- all countries may soon face a "tsunami of cases," as a World Health Organization official put it, that will overwhelm health care systems.
 "We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigation areas," Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said, explaining the White House's alternative thinking. But counting on pharmaceutical rescue alone, as Meadows suggests, would prolong the pandemic, possibly for years.
 The fact is, vaccines and drug treatments are needed in concert with basic control measures, not instead of them. Although there is great hope that at least one of the many vaccines in development will be effective, there's no guarantee. And even a successful vaccine can't be expected to make COVID-19 go away. Shots may very well provide less than total protection -- and many people will decline to be inoculated.
 Meanwhile, the basic COVID-19 control strategies are easy to practice and plainly effective. Masks block the transmission of the virus from one person to another via droplets expelled when breathing or talking. This explains why mask mandates in many cities and states have saved hundreds of thousands of lives already. An estimated 130,000 more could be spared by March if everyone in the U.S. were to mask up, according to one new analysis. Otherwise, the American death toll stands to reach half a million by the end of February.
 Even after an effective vaccine is developed, mask wearing, distancing, hand washing, crowd limitations and testing and tracing will still be needed. As Anthony Fauci put it in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week, "Even if one or more vaccines have high efficacy and uptake in the population, it will take at least several months for enough people to be vaccinated to confer herd immunity on a population basis."
 It is pointless to hope that President Donald Trump will come to grips with the coronavirus challenge. He rarely wears a mask himself, and he has falsely claimed that most people who do wear them contract COVID-19. He listens to the advice of someone who lacks expertise in infectious diseases and is willing to let the virus spread unchecked through the population. The president hasn't met with the experts on his own coronavirus task force for months.
 Yet Americans can't wait for a change of leadership in Washington to control COVID-19. For now, state and local leaders need to help people better understand the need to protect themselves. As new and worsening outbreaks fill hospitals nationwide, starkly demonstrating the danger of allowing the virus to spread, the message should become easier to impart: Just wear a mask.

NEW YORK (AP) — Two of Fox News Channel's three prime-time opinion hosts — Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham — reached their biggest weekly audiences ever during the week leading up to Election Day. The third host, Sean Hannity, had his second-best week, with only his coverage of the 2020 Republican national convention topping it, the Nielsen company said. With news ratings up overall, President Donald Trump could take heart that Fox News, the network that most appeals to his fans, outdrew MSNBC and CNN combined in prime time as Election Day drew near. The president did not seem particularly grateful. During an appearance on “Fox & Friends” Tuesday morning, he criticized the network. He suggested they showed his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, too much on the air; Fox's Brian Kilmeade said Fox was trying to show both sides. “I'm not complaining,” Trump said. “I'm just telling people. It's one of the biggest differences of this season compared to last.” Trump specifically exempted Carlson, Hannity, Ingraham and the “Fox & Friends” cast from his criticism, however. With two football games and the conclusion of the World Series dominating its schedule, the Fox broadcasting network was the most-watched network in prime time, reaching an average of 7 million viewers. NBC had 5.6 million, ABC had 4.1 million, CBS had 3 million, Ion Television had 1.2 million, Univision had 1.1 million and Univision had 910,000. Fox News averaged 5.03 million viewers for the week, easily topping the cable networks. MSNBC had 2.36 million, ESPN had 2.15 million, CNN had 1.95 million and Hallmark had 1.56 million.

The Brazilian's last Champions League goal came almost a year ago, in December 2019, and his last strike in any competition was back in February, in a Copa del Rey defeat by Real Sociedad.
 The young winger burst onto the scene with a hat-trick against Galatasaray in the Champions League last season, but that quickly became a peak which he failed to get close to reach again during the remainder of the 2019-20 campaign.
 Zidane relied on him for his impressive maturity – certainly relative to his compatriot Vinicius Junior – but Rodrygo lacked the dynamism and offensive spark to help Madrid emerge from their creativity slump at the end of last season and start of this.
 Marco Asensio, Vinicius, and even Lucas Vazquez had worked their way ahead of Rodrygo in the pecking order, so his brilliant strike not only revived Madrid’s troubled Champions League campaign but also his own prospects at the capital club.
 There are still places up for grabs in this Madrid team, with Zidane searching for a starting XI he can rely on.
 Defeat by Shakhtar Donetsk on matchday one and last week’s draw with Borussia Monchengladbach exposed Madrid’s fragility and meant that they badly needed a win against Antonio Conte’s own struggling side.
 Having seen Hazard score spectacularly against Huesca on the weekend – his first goal in over a year for the club – Zidane unsurprisingly stuck with the Belgian in attack.
 Even though he has rarely been fit enough to start, his presence is felt every time Madrid play – they have been missing an attacking talent of his description.
 Madrid have scraped by, winning the title last season thanks to blood, sweat and Barcelona’s VAR tears, all the while screaming out for someone who can give them a chance to play in a different way. Hazard’s return to fitness – hopefully for a sustained period of time – could be crucial.
 As well as offering his own threat, his presence means defenders can’t focus only on locking down Karim Benzema, Madrid’s best player for the past two years, bar captain Sergio Ramos.
 Indeed, Achraf Hakimi forgot all about the French striker as he played a shocking back-pass that left his former Madrid team-mate one on one with goalkeeper Samir Handanovic.
 Benzema skipped around the Slovenian and slid the ball into the empty net for his second goal of the European campaign, and fourth in three games across all competitions.
 Ramos doubled Madrid’s lead with a perfectly placed header from Toni Kroos’s corner, angling his effort down and into the far corner, leaving Handanovic rooted to the spot. Madrid’s skipper has 100 goals now and such flawless finishing illustrates why.

Managing second waves, however, requires improved understanding of the causal mechanisms involved in infection chains - what, for example, are the relative risks of infection associated with working in a packing plant or clothing factory, compared to drinking in a bar or taking part in a church service? Much of this understanding is situation-specific. For Africa, a factor on which currently we have too little comparative information is the importance of ventilation. The virus is carried in fine particles in the air and dispersed by breeze. Many daily activities in poorer tropical Africa take place in the open air, or in well-ventilated environments such as open-aided sheds providing shade, and this may be a factor in lower transmission rates for SARS Cov-2 virus.

GREEN BAY, Wis. — This hasn’t been an ideal start to a busy week for the Green Bay Packers.
 They lost 28-22 to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday in a game that revealed how they need to shore up their run defense and get more production from wide receivers other than Davante Adams. Then they had a player test positive for COVID-19 for the first time this season.
 All this comes as Green Bay (5-2) prepares to visit the San Francisco 49ers (4-4) on Thursday in a rematch of the NFC championship game that the Packers lost 37-20 last season. Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Monday he’s preparing for the game to go on as scheduled even after the positive test.
 “It’s the situation that we’re presented with, and we’re going to make the best of it,” LaFleur said. “It’s not an excuse to go out there and play bad or anything like that. It is what it is, man. You’ve got to adapt and adjust.”
 This short week wouldn’t have given the Packers much time to get ready for the 49ers game even without the positive COVID-19 test.
 The Packers haven’t announced who tested positive, but they did place rookie running back A.J. Dillon on the COVID-19 reserve list Monday. That list is for players who either test positive for COVID-19 or who have been in close contact with an infected person.
 Green Bay has plenty to work on.
 The Packers lost to the Vikings by allowing Dalvin Cook to rush for 163 yards, catch two passes for 63 more yards and score four touchdowns.
 “We had too many missed tackles,” LaFleur said. “We have to make sure we have 11 hats rolling to the football, playing relentlessly with that intent on every play. If a guy’s tired, we have a lot of confidence in the guys that are on the sideline to go in there and replace one of those guys.”
 Adams scored three touchdowns for Green Bay, but no other Packers wideout caught more than one pass.
 With Tuesday’s trade deadline approaching, the Packers must decide whether to add firepower on either side of the ball or hope they can shore up their weaknesses by getting healthier.
 Wide receiver Allen Lazard and linebacker Christian Kirksey are eligible to come off injured reserve at any time after missing Green Bay’s last four games. Lazard had six catches for 146 yards and a touchdown in a 37-30 victory at New Orleans before a core injury sidelined him. Kirksey’s 27 tackles rank fourth on the team.
 WHAT’S WORKING
 The Packers miss the injured Aaron Jones but have continued running the ball pretty effectively without him. Jamaal Williams led the way with 75 yards Sunday as the Packers gained 109 yards on the ground and picked up 4.5 yards per carry. … Green Bay’s running backs and tight ends are doing a nice job of getting involved in the passing game. Williams and tight ends Robert Tonyan and Jace Sternberger combined to catch 14 passes for 152 yards. … The offense overall moved the ball well, as the Packers punted just once all day.
 WHAT NEEDS WORK
 Green Bay must improve its tackling and upgrade a run defense that allowed the Vikings to gain 5.1 yards per carry. … The Packers must cash in on drives better after having four scoreless trips to Vikings territory in the second half.
 STOCK UP
 Adams has five touchdown catches in his last two games. He’s tied for the NFL lead with seven touchdown catches despite missing two games with a hamstring injury.
 STOCK DOWN
 Pick just about any Packers on defense. They all played a part in allowing Cook to score touchdowns on each of the Vikings’ first four possessions. There were missed tackles all over the field.
 INJURED
 Cornerback Kevin King (quadriceps) missed a third straight game. Jones (calf) and offensive tackle David Bakhtiari (chest) have missed two straight. The Packers' injury report says offensive tackle Rick Wagner (knee), tight end Marcedes Lewis (knee) and safeties Will Redmond (shoulder) and Vernon Scott (shoulder) wouldn't have been available if the team had practiced Monday. The Packers also said running back Jamaal Williams and linebacker Kamal Martin wouldn't have been able to practice Monday for reasons that the team described as “not injury related.”
 KEY NUMBERS
 4 – The Packers have forced only four turnovers all season and didn’t have any takeaways Sunday. Their four takeaways match Dallas and Las Vegas for the lowest total of any NFL team.
 NEXT STEPS
 The Packers will decide whether to make a move before Tuesday’s trade deadline as they get ready to visit San Francisco on Thursday.

 # How to run a race in a time of surging coronavirus
 By Gretchen Reynolds

 Competitive runners could soon face a familiar 2020 dilemma, as some race directors tiptoe forward with plans for in-person events, even as coronavirus cases climb again nationwide. Runners registered for these races, including me, must now decide whether we feel comfortable racing in person and, if so, how we can best protect ourselves and the runners loping past us (or, for the speedy, vice versa).
 To learn more, I spoke with race officials and infection-control researchers about starting lines, masks, the politesse of spitting, how to socially distance on the run and what other race modifications runners should expect — or demand — at in-person events now. This is what they had to say.

Those who did vote on Election Day included some who wanted to vote by mail but waited too long to request a ballot or didn't receive their ballots in time.
 Kaal Ferguson, 26, planned to vote by mail but was concerned he hadn't left enough time to send his ballot back. So he voted in person in Atlanta, despite worries he could be exposed to COVID-19 by fellow voters.
 "Obviously everybody has their right to vote," he said. "But it's kind of scary knowing that there's not a place just for them to vote if they'd had it, so you could easily be exposed."
 Others were likely persuaded by the president's rhetoric attacking mail voting or simply preferred to vote in person after reports surfaced over the summer of mail delivery delays following a series of policy changes implemented by the U.S. Postal Service's new leader, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a major GOP donor.
 "I don't want to see no mailman. I like to stand here, see my own people, wait in the line and do my civil duty," said James "Sekou" Jenkins, a 68 year-old retired carpenter and mechanic who waited about 15 minutes before polls opened in West Philadelphia and voted for Biden about an hour later.
 On Tuesday afternoon, a federal judge in Washington D.C. ordered U.S. Postal Service inspectors to sweep 27 mail processing facilities for lingering mail- in ballots and send out those votes immediately. The order, which includes centers in central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Detroit, Atlanta, south Florida and parts of Wisconsin, followed concerns the agency wouldn't be able to deliver ballots on time. Postal data has shown service in some battleground areas severely lagging.
 "The slowdown and compromising of the U.S. Postal Service was a concern," said Rebecca Kraft, a 41-year-old Milwaukee resident who voted in person. "So I said 'All right, if I'm feeling healthy, I am going to go do it at the polls just to make sure.'"
 Misinformation about election procedures and threats of foreign interference also clouded the run-up to Election Day. States hammered out plans for protecting against cyberattacks, countering misinformation and strengthening an election infrastructure tested by massive early voting and pandemic precautions.
 The cybersecurity agency at the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that it had seen no apparent signs of any malicious cyber activity, at least not yet. But officials with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency also said it was too early to declare victory.
 "It has been quiet and we take some confidence in that but we are not out of the woods yet," said a senior CISA official, speaking on condition of anonymity to brief reporters about ongoing nationwide election monitoring efforts ahead of an official evaluation.

WEST BEND — A site plan for a Dairy Queen location will be brought before the Plan Commission Wednesday at 6 p.m. at the West Bend Common Council Chambers, 1115 S. Main St.
 The 0.88-acre site at 1043 S. Main St. is the site of the former Mutual Mall. That building will be razed and the site will be redeveloped with altered street access and site grades, according to meeting documents.
 In its place, a 6,334-square-foot Dairy Queen restaurant will be constructed.
 The applicant and owner of the Dairy Queen location is Kevin Scheunemann, who also owns Dairy Queen locations in Kewaskum and Jackson. Nate Groff of Kimley- Horn and Associates based in Warrenville, Ill., is the agent.
 The site will have two driveway: one on the south side and the other on the north side to access South Main Street. There will be 40 parking stalls.
 Sanitary sewer and water laterals exist on the site. A stormwater management plan is under review by staff. The site grades were designed to drain to the north around the building to various catch basins and discharge to the storm sewer on Main Street.
 City staff has recommended approval of the site under the conditions that an erosion plan be submitted and approved, a landscape bid be provided, a stormwater management plan be approved and the site plan is revised to incorporate technical corrections as identified during the city review.
 The commission will also hold a public hearing for separate approval of an oversized electronic message center. No hearing date is listed.
 Developers have proposed a 62-square-foot monument sign at the corner of the site with an electronic message center. The size exceeds the permitted sign code of 16 square feet. The Plan Commission can grant an exception after the public hearing and if the exception is desired, staff would recommend a ground sign exception before issuing a building permit. Two more signs, measuring 76.4 square feet and 57.6 square feet, are proposed on the north and west sides of the building.

Toronto Wolfpack fans are familiar with the sight of giant forward Adam Sidlow running with the ball, dragging would-be tacklers with him.
 The six-foot-four 251-pounder left a mark, either as a starter or impact player off the bench.
 "All successful teams need players like Adam," said Wolfpack coach Brian McDermott. "Professional to the core. Unconditionally willing to do whatever the team needs from him. Tough and resilient. And a great leader.
 "He’s been more than a significant part of the Toronto Wolfpack journey."
 Sadly that road ended Monday when Super League rejected the financially troubled franchise's bid for reinstatement in 2021 under new ownership.
 Sidlow, an original member of the Wolfpack, had been hoping the Toronto team would get a reprieve.
 "It's been one of the best experiences in rugby league I've had," the 33-year- old said from Wigan, England.
 But after three years of success on the field that resulted in promotion to the top-tier Super League, the franchise ground to a halt. First it was the pandemic in March. And then, in July, it was majority owner David Argyle running out of money.
 Having already seen past clubs Bradford and Salford endure financial uncertainty, Sidlow tried to remain realistic during the months in limbo. Still, Monday's negative vote still hit him hard.
 "My first initial reaction was just shock, anger ... and a bit of confusion as well," he said. "The first thing I said to my wife was 'I don't know if I'm relieved because we've been waiting so long, because we've got a decision finally.'"
 "It wasn't meant to be and I hope it's not to the detriment to the sport," he added.
 The Wolfpack last played March 11, defeating Huddersfield Giants 18-0 in Coral Challenge Cup play. The last paycheques were issued June 10 with the club standing down July 20 saying it could not afford to resume play this season.
 Sidlow's contract with the Wolfpack runs through 2021. Does he think he will ever see that money?
 "I live in hope," he said after a pause. "A lot of guys are struggling. We'll have to see what the future holds. We'll try to get the money. We'll have to speak to David and see what the situation is now."
 Sidlow was a constant in Wolfpack colours. He played 50 or 51 straight games — he couldn't remember which at the time — until a minor hamstring tear suffered in March 2019 sidelined him briefly.
 Hard to stop with ball in hand, Sidlow is adept at keeping attacks alive by offloading the ball to teammates in the tackle. On defence, he hits like a hammer.
 McDermott says whichever club lands Sidlow will benefit from the move. "A valuable addition to any team's roster right now," he said.
 Sidlow believes there is more rugby in him. But he held off joining another club, hopeful the Wolfpack might return and knowing that any offers out there would not be that generous given Toronto's status.
 "It's been an eye-opener," said Sidlow. "In one sense, I'm in a privileged position in that I've got a lot of good family around me who help me out."
 He has been working the last few months with his father-in-law's groundworks company — operating a dumper.
 "I thought I'll go out, get a job, earn some money. Everybody's got to do that for the family," said Sidlow, who has sons aged six and 11 and a nine-year-old daughter. "But mentally it's been a struggle."
 The hardest part was waiting word on the Wolfpack's future, with decisions being delayed again and again.
 "And then It gets dragged out to a decision that in my view is the wrong decision for the sport. But it can't be helped now," he said. "I feel for a lot of other people who aren't in as privileged a position as me. I know some lads have struggled and I just hope someone steps in and helps with the mental side of it. Because rugby lads do find it hard to come forward and say that they are struggling. But anyone can see this could cause some mental issues."
 He didn't have any problems with the front office during his time with Toronto "other than the odd late payment."
 "But up until this year, we did get our money so that wasn't a problem."
 And he knows people put in long hours off the pitch to try to make the franchise a success.
 "We know that it doesn't just take us running out on the rugby field to create a team or a brand. They made mistakes obviously, but they said they wanted to get into Super League and they did. It took a lot of hard work but I thought they were on the right track.
 "But for a global pandemic, we might not be having this conversation now."
 Sidlow calls Argyle "a good chairman, to a degree, up to the end."
 "What he's done to these people and families, not paying them, I totally disagree with. He's brought a lot of misery in what he did by just stepping down and stopping paying. But I can have a look on the other side of the fence and say there's been a global pandemic. And the guy has put a lot of money into it and just run out of money. I can't bad mouth him too much because I've really enjoyed these past few years that I've been there (in Toronto).
 "it must be a struggle (for Argyle). I hope we can come to an agreement and get it sorted with everyone's money," he added.
 While leaving his family to play in Toronto wasn't fun, Sidlow says the chance to see and play in North America was special. As was the fan response.
 "The actual amount of energy that they bring when they come to the game and the passion that they show as fans was brilliant."
 It also gave him a chance to bring his family over to Canada "which I possibly may never have done but for the Wolfpack."
 In a 2019 interview with The Canadian Press, he credited his wife for giving him the green light to come to Canada.
 "She said 'You'll regret it if you don't jump at it with two hands and take that opportunity,''' he recalled. "So I've got a big thank you to say to her for that really. It's one of the best things I've done.''

Minor problems occur every election, and Tuesday was no different given the level of voter enthusiasm, the decentralized nature of U.S elections and last- minute voting changes brought on by the global pandemic. But the stakes were high with so much scrutiny on voting this year and the potential for further litigation.
 President Donald Trump has already threatened legal action to prevent the counting of ballots that arrive after Election Day, which some states allow. Meanwhile, concerns about mail delivery delays prompted a federal judge to order postal workers in major cities to sweep processing facilities for any remaining ballots before the end of the day.
 Officials have already warned that counting ballots could take days due to the avalanche of mail votes, which take more time to process and could result in another round of court battles.
 On Tuesday, there were long lines and sporadic reports of polling places opening late, along with equipment issues in counties in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas and Georgia.
 There were also reports, as there are every election, of efforts to discourage people from voting that surfaced in robocalls in a few states. The FBI was investigating.
 But there were no signs of large-scale voter intimidation or clashes at the polls as some had feared given the level of political rancor this year.
 "I would say it is blissfully uneventful," Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel told reporters. "We've had virtually no disturbances of any kind."
 In the months leading up to Election Day, election officials had to deal with a pandemic that has infected more than 9 million Americans and killed more than 230,000, forcing them to make systemic changes largely on the fly and with limited federal money. Meanwhile, Trump repeatedly sought to undermine the election with unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.
 He has particularly targeted the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed — at least for now — a three-day extension for receiving and counting absentee ballots. Over the weekend, Trump said that as soon as the polls close there on Tuesday, "We're going in with our lawyers."
 Election officials had hoped that if enough people voted early, it would ease some of the problems that states experienced during the primaries, when voters waited hours in line to cast ballots. That appeared to be what transpired Tuesday, although some problems seemed inevitable.
 Hand sanitizer on voters' hands caused a ballot scanner to jam at a polling place in Des Moines, Iowa. The machine was fixed in about an hour, and poll workers moved the sanitizing station farther back in the line so voters' hands would be dry when they first touched the ballots.
 In Pennsylvania, a judge in Democrat Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton extended voting at two precincts inside an elementary school for 45 minutes past the normal 8 p.m. close of voting, because machines had been down earlier in the day, said Lackawanna County spokesman Joe D'Arienzo.
 There were also a few other issues with voting technology. Electronic pollbooks from the vendor KnowInk failed in Ohio's second-largest county and in a small Texas county, forcing voting delays as officials replaced them with paper pollbooks.
 Even though problems were expected, voters were still frustrated.
 "We've had four years to prepare for this," said Jenny Harris, who encountered problems with touchscreen voting machines at her polling place in Atlanta. "And the fact that we're still having issues on the day that we go to the polls, it blows my mind."

The Florida House is expected to vote Wednesday to allow people with concealed-weapons licenses to openly carry sidearms in most public places.      And in preparing the bill late Tuesday for a final vote, the House voted 72-43 to tack on an amendment that would let lawmakers with concealed-carry licenses pack heat during legislative meetings and on the House floor.   "I think it really applies to the fact that we allow the judiciary, a co-equal branch of government, to have that privilege, and I think it should be enjoyed by duly elected officials such as ourselves," said Rep. John Wood, a Winter Haven Republican who proposed the amendment.      State law prohibits people from carrying guns during legislative committee meetings.      The amendment would allow lawmakers to carry concealed weapons at the meetings. Wood added he was willing to consider expanding his amendment to let lawmakers open-carry and for legislative staff members with concealed-weapons licenses to carry guns during meetings.      Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Fort Walton Beach Republican who is sponsoring the overall open-carry bill (HB 163), called the amendment a "provocative concept."      Another bill (HB 4001) expected to go before the House for a vote Wednesday would allow people with concealed-weapons licenses to keep carrying guns while strolling on college and university campuses.
 However, while the House on Tuesday prepared the bills for final votes, it doesn't appear the campus-carry measure will get unholstered in the Senate.
 And the open-carry measure, which Democrats sought unsuccessfully to amend Tuesday, also has an uncertain future in the Senate.      The Senate version of open-carry (SB 300) may be heard by the Judiciary Committee next week.
 Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, said Tuesday he expects the Judiciary Committee to consider amendments that would match a number of suggestions offered by the Florida Sheriffs Association. Those suggestions are related to inadvertent or accidental displays of firearms. The sheriffs' proposals wouldn't allow open-carry and have been opposed by gun-rights groups.      Gaetz said the intent of the bill is to "vindicate" the rights of concealed- weapons license holders, as Florida has banned open-carry since establishing concealed-weapons rules in 1987.      "We know a few things today that we didn't know in 1987," said Gaetz. "Now, 45 states in this great country allow for some version of open-carry."      The proposal would require people who openly carry to maintain the guns in holsters, cases or bags. The bill would also acknowledge that private employers can display written notices stating that possession of a firearm on their property is prohibited.      "We do have businesses that have very large quantities of land," Gaetz said. "I can't imagine a circumstance, for example at Disney World, where Disney World would have to post every 40 feet what the firearms policy is on their property."
 Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Coral Springs, proposed a number of amendments Tuesday, including separate proposals that would have prohibited openly carrying weapons within 500 feet of polling places, movie theaters, school safety zones, churches or bars.

Lloyd Mason likely wouldn’t have been able to vote on Tuesday if not for a free bus ride to his voting precinct.
 “It was valuable to me,” said Mason, 74. “I didn’t have any transportation to get here.”
 Mason was among area residents taking advantage of the Souls to the Polls bus service offered by the Pasquotank County chapter of the NAACP.
 The non-partisan service provided residents free rides to and from their voting precinct, said Keith Rivers, president of the local NAACP chapter.
 Rivers, who was driving the bus, was speaking during a bus stop at the West precinct at Pasquotank Elementary School around 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday. While Rivers was out and about in the bus Tuesday, the bus also was used to provide free rides to the K.E. White Graduate Center during the early voting period. The center was the county’s designated in-person early voting site.
 Rivers estimated the number of voters who used the free bus from the start of the early voting period on Oct. 15 to Tuesday at anywhere between 85 to 100. Anyone in need of a ride to their precinct could request service.
 “We are operating along non-partisan lines,” Rivers said.
   
 The bus resembled the small white buses used by the Inter-County Public Transportation Authority, but was decorated in red, white and blue and featured Souls to the Polls written prominently across the side.
 The bus also included the phone number to request a ride posted in several exterior locations, and was equipped to host residents confined to a wheelchair. That was a feature that came in handy at least once this voting period, Rivers said.
 News of the free bus service was spread by word of mouth, Rivers said. Photos of the bus that included the contact information were posted on Facebook to get the message out.
 The idea for the bus service was built around Sunday voting, Rivers said. In September 2019 during early voting in the 3rd Congressional District special election, the Pasquotank Board of Election extended the early voting period to Sunday.
 That election was held to determine a successor to Congressman Walter B. Jones Jr., who had died in office. Rivers said the bus was also used to transport voters to the one-stop site during Sunday voting in Pasquotank on Oct. 25.
 “It’s all about engagement, to get people out to vote,” he said.

Vancouver's council is being asked to consider taking the first small steps toward hosting another Olympic Games.
 Council will consider a motion Wednesday to write letters to the Canadian Olympic Committee, Canadian Paralympic Committee and four local First Nations seeking input on a possible bid for the 2030 Winter Games.
 Coun. Melissa De Genova said she put the motion forward early this year but the meeting was derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 She was "a little surprised" to see it back on the agenda but still thinks it's worth considering, she said.
 "I was in no hurry to bring it back myself after the pandemic, we certainly have priorities as we move into our budget," she said.
 "That being said, I'm starting to see the benefits this may have, you know, as we look toward COVID-19 economic recovery for the city."
 The motion is not a vote on whether to make a bid, she emphasized, only to explore the option.
 "It's a cautious step forward to consider this and it all starts with engaging with the four host nations and our regional partners that were part of the 2010 Olympics," she said.
 If the motion passes, Mayor Kennedy Stewart would also pen letters on behalf of council to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier John Horgan asking if the federal and provincial governments would contribute funding for the bid, including money for potential infrastructure projects.
 De Genova said part of the momentum for the motion came from the "nostalgia" generated by the 10th anniversary celebrations of the 2010 Games in Vancouver.
 As a recent host, Vancouver already has much of the infrastructure required for the Olympics.
 Hosting another Games could help leverage funding for things like more affordable housing and transit expansion. If it creates another 2,500 jobs, as the 2010 Olympics did, that could be a significant economic driver, De Genova said.
 "It's our job to make sure that we leave no stone unturned when looking for opportunities for economic recovery," she said.
 De Genova also noted that 2030 was selected as a date for consideration before the pandemic and that might change. There are many unknowns without a vaccine yet for COVID-19.
 If both senior levels of government agree to consider providing funding, council would direct city staff to do further study on the costs and other factors. They would also be asked to report on recommendations to council, including on whether a referendum should be held to gauge local support.

 The proposal died not with a bang but a whimper,  tabled indefinitely without ever coming to a vote in the House Subcommittee on Rulemaking Oversight and Repeal .
 That panel reviews proposed state rules that would have significant cost to the public. The increase was approved by the Florida Board of Medicine a year ago and affirmed by a hearing officer in December.
 “It became apparent the votes were not there,” said the board’s legal advisor, Ed Tellechea. “We hope to bring it back next year, when it’s not an election year.”
 Inaction by the Legislature means that even if the state prevails in an appeal of the rule to the courts, the price hike cannot go into effect in 2016.
 Doctors and companies that specialize in copying medical records have been pushing for the price increase for years. They say that federal privacy laws make it more time-consuming and costly to copy records than it used to be. Even without that complication, they say, costs have risen since the current price cap for doctors’ copies was set in 1988.
 “The medical community is not looking to make money off this; we’re looking to minimize the amount of money we lose,” doctors’ lobbyist Chris Nuland testified at a subcommittee hearing in January.
 Noting that hospitals are allowed to charge $1 a page, “we’re just looking for fairness,” said Alan Pillersdorf, past president of the Florida Medical Association.
 The current cap on doctors’ copying charges is $1 a page for the first 25 pages, and a quarter a page after that.  The fee is the same whether records are kept on paper or in a computer.
 Proponents of a higher cap for doctors’ copies say the record for an average patient would have only about three dozen pages. That would make the price hike less than $10.
 But opponents – including AARP and lawyers who help clients apply for disability or injury claims – say those who have the fattest files are those least able to pay the higher fee: the elderly, disabled, sick and injured.
 A 100-page file would cost less than half as much to copy under the current price structure as it would in the one the medical board proposed.

HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Republican Greg Gianforte faces Democrat Mike Cooney in the race to become Montana's next governor. The seat is up for grabs as Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was termed out and instead ran for the U.S. Senate. Cooney, the current lieutenant governor, highlighted his four decades of public service, including two terms as secretary of state, and promised to defend access to health care and public lands. Gianforte, who serves as Montana’s lone representative in the U.S. House, promised to fix the economy using his business experience, which includes founding a start-up technology company in his hometown of Bozeman. This is the second run at the governorship for both candidates. Gianforte lost his run against incumbent Gov. Steve Bullock in 2016. Cooney ran unsuccessfully for the seat in 2000. Gianforte, known for assaulting a reporter on the eve of a special election to the U.S. House in 2017, won that election and was reelected to the seat in 2018. The assault incident drew praise from President Trump, who endorsed Gianforte in 2020. The candidates exchanged barbs throughout the campaign, with Cooney calling Gianforte a “New Jersey millionaire” and Gianforte calling Cooney a “career politician.” But both candidates embraced their identities, as Gianforte promised his business experience would position him to improve the state’s economy, and Cooney said his experience holding public office meant he could hit the ground running. Gianforte’s career in the tech industry began in New Jersey, before he moved to Bozeman in 1995 and founded RightNow technologies, a company that was eventually sold to Oracle for nearly $2 billion. Gianforte, a devout Christian who subscribes to creationist views, has donated millions of dollars through the Gianforte Family Foundation to various...

But there’s far more Plum Nelly than meets the eye. It began in 1947 at an outdoor art show held at Fannie Mennen’s house on the back of Lookout Mountain, Georgia. Ms. Mennen’s property had years earlier been named Plum Nelly when her brother-in-law, Louis Marks, after driving, what to him seemed a long way from Chattanooga, remarked, “Fannie, your place is plum out of Tennessee and nearly out of Georgia.” (Louis’s Virginia Tidewater accent was responsible for the change from nearly to nelly.)

Currently, women represent only 20% of the judges on the bench of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). As the ICJ is poised to celebrate its 75th Anniversary in April 2021, it is noteworthy that historically, out of the 108 judges since the court was established, only four have been women. This editorial argues that gender parity at the ICJ should be of concern not only for Africa but also for the world. To date, the United Nations' principal judicial organ remains one of the most imbalanced international courts when it comes to gender parity. This imbalance has prompted scholars and advocacy groups such as the Gender Equality Campaign (GQUAL) to engage in advocacy for diversifying the ICJ bench.

There are two points for Africa. First, a lot of what is known from Europe and elsewhere may not be relevant to understanding Covid-19 infection risks in Africa. Crowded markets and public transport may be much more important sources of infection than factories or residential homes for the elderly.

Las Vegas Raiders tackle Trent Brown remains in Cleveland undergoing tests after being hospitalized following an IV mishap before a game against the Browns.
 Brown was sent to the hospital shortly before the game between the Raiders and Browns started on Sunday. NFL Network reported that a pregame IV caused air to enter Brown’s bloodstream.
 “I’m very glad to report he’s up and seems to be doing well,” coach Jon Gruden said Monday. “We’re awaiting some of the results of some of the extensive tests that they did today and yesterday. I don’t have anything to report other than he had an issue. I want to really thank our medical staff, what a job they did in an emergency situation. We’re just happy he’s up and around. Once we get the official word as to what is wrong with Trent, we’ll let you know.”
 Brown was supposed to return to action this week after missing one game following a positive test for the coronavirus. He was activated off the COVID-19 list on Friday and practiced that day. He was set to play before the team said he “felt ill” before the game and was deactivated.
 Gruden said he doesn’t know when Brown will be able to return to Las Vegas or what his playing status will be.
 “The most important thing is that we find out what went wrong,” Gruden said. “Our prayers are with Trent, certainly. He’s in the best possible hands he could be right now. His availability and his status are really not up for discussion right now as far as we’re concerned.”
 Brown signed a four-year, $66 million contract with the Raiders before the 2019 season. He has dealt with several injuries, the positive coronavirus test and this latest mishap and has been able to play at least 10 snaps in only 11 of 23 games with the team.
 Quarterback Derek Carr said he and his teammates were “a little scared” after seeing Brown get wheeled out of the locker room before the game.
 The Raiders managed to regroup and won the game 16-6. Third-string tackle Brandon Parker, who was supposed to be inactive, ended up playing most of the game after Sam Young left with a knee injury in the first half.
 “I think the big thing is we were all shaken up pretty good,” Gruden said. “You get shook up when you see one of your own go down and you don’t know what’s wrong with him. We were able to assure our players that he was in good hands and his signs were vital and he was doing good. We said a prayer for Trent before the game and then we went out and tried to win the game for him. It’s something that’s on our mind, weighing heavily on us right now. We hope he’s OK.”

 It used to be easy. The domestic racing season would be over by September, and a month later contracts would expire. Bam! On October 1, you'd see the old faces in new places, with team press releases and social media announcements hitting the wire.
 Well, this year is all jacked up. The racing schedule got pushed back, so we no longer have a road map to silly season. Turns out several big things randomly happened in the last few days. Here's a roundup!
 Barcia to GasGas: This was brewing for a while, but the news is so big that you have to stop what you're doing when you hear about it. Justin Barcia will be racing a Troy Lee Designs/Red Bull/GasGas MC 450F in 2021, which is ostensibly a factory KTM. This Barcia brand switch could have as much impact as any other news in the paddock for 2021.
 Barcia rode Yamahas for five of the last six years (with one forgettable Suzuki year with JGR in between) and issues with the bike were always lurking. He'd have some good races, even some wins, and everything would appear fine. Then a month later you'd hear things weren't so good. Is it Barcia or the bike? Look, although the stock YZ450F is well-received, Barcia isn't the only one who couldn't get on with the machine every weekend at the top level. Meanwhile, the KTM platform has had a lot of success, especially in supercross. So that's where the intrigue comes from with this scenario. Will this make an impact?
 Hard to believe Barcia has been around for so long but we still don't have complete data here. He was dynamite at times in his rookie year on a Honda all the way back in 2013. He, um, didn't like the bike in 2014 and his sophomore 450 season wasn't so good. Then he moved to JGR and a Yamaha for 2015, and then came all these seasons on Yamahas (and one with Suzuki). That's a lot of seasons of "Is it the bike or is it Justin?" This team switch might shed real light on this subject. What will it look like?
