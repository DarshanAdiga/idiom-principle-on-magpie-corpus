Technical chart claims that Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC) would settle between $4.06/share to $4.52/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $3.36 mark, then the market for Kinross Gold Corporation becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $3.12 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.27. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

 Commissioner President Kyle Conrad was the only commissioner physically present at the meeting but Mickey Read and Tim Drenth joined him via phone conference, as were EMA Director Ray Chambers and Newton County Public Health Nurse Kim Durham.
 The commissioners voted to approve three policies stating that any employee full-time or part-time working from home will be paid, any employee that is required to be quarantined by the county, a medical professional, or showing symptoms will also be paid, and any employee who has left or leaves the state for vacation or leisure will be required to stay home for a 14-day self isolation period. Those employees can use sick days and or vacation time, but if those are not sufficient then the days off will not be paid.

You’re not alone in wondering about the possibility of the Bears taking a running back. I understand what you are saying about Montgomery, who was underutilized at times during his rookie season and disappointing at others. When you consider the Bears traded up to draft him, I don’t think they are ready to pull the plug on him. I agree: a potentially exciting back could be on the board when the Bears go on the clock at No. 43. I will not rule it out because they have to find ways to make this offense more explosive, and Montgomery does, as you point out, lack speed. With a better offense and new coaching, the organization believes Montgomery will have some success. If I am wrong and they go after a back in Round 2, you will have been ahead of the curve on this one, Bob.

Free agency is a two-way street, and no one can convince me Brady would find anything about the Bears attractive. The Buccaneers had two 1,000-yard receivers last season — Mike Evans and Chris Godwin — and a productive vertical threat in Breshad Perriman whom they might re-sign. Add in a pair of tight ends in O.J. Howard and Cameron Brate who can produce, and it’s not even close. If you’ve been following the script with Brady, one of the things he wanted was to be around more skill-position talent after things eroded somewhat in New England, especially after the retirement of tight end Rob Gronkowski. The Bears have wide receiver Allen Robinson, and who else is proven and durable? Pace could have put his best pitch together for Brady, but it would have been an impossible sell. The Bears were one of the worst offenses in the league last season, and franchise history is never a selling point in free agency. It’s something players mention after they sign in order to appease the fan base. Free agency is about dollars and opportunity, and even with more dollars, the Bears could not have sold opportunity to Brady with their offense.

 Unable to travel to Italy, Foreign Correspondent used Skype interviews and mobile phone video to go inside the nation's coronavirus lockdown to see how Italians are adjusting.
 Overlooking the peaceful Lake Maggiore in the village of Sesto Calende, about 50 kilometres north of Milan, Catriona's home might have felt safely removed from the chaos of Italy's coronavirus frontline.
 But the virus has struck a little too close for comfort. There is a random element to the infection that has unsettled everyone.

Senior International Olympic Committee (IOC) official Dick Pound said Monday a postponement of this year's Tokyo Olympics is now inevitable as the world reels from the coronavirus pandemic.
 The IOC said on Sunday the body would wait four more weeks before announcing its decision on the fate of the July 24-August 9 Games, amid mounting calls for them to be rescheduled.
 Pound however believes the IOC -- which ruled out a cancellation of the Games -- is now laying the groundwork for a postponement.
 "My interpretation of the IOC's communications is they don't want to cancel, and they don't think they can continue with the July 24 date," Pound told AFP. "So you're looking at the 'P' word - postponement.

 "And then in four weeks they're going to try and come out with a plan B and make it as specific as they can make it in that time period."
 Pound, who is Canadian, said the "astonishing" spread of COVID-19 across the globe left the IOC with no other choice.
 "This is not something that's going to clear up by July 24," Pound said.
 "And this thing isn't going to go away by September or October. A lot of the biggest countries in the world are just about overwhelmed, and it's just starting to take root in Africa. It's a no-go in my view."
 A one-year postponement to 2021 remained the most likely option, Pound added.
 "I think the one-year postponement is the most feasible because it gives you the most time to organise," he said.
 A number of Olympic committees and sports federations have already indicated unwillingness to participate in Tokyo if the games are held in July as planned.
 On Sunday the Canadian Olympic Committee became the first national olympic committee to declare they would not participate if the Games took place in July.
 In the United States, both the governing bodies of track and field and swimming have called for the Games to be postponed.

In the days after 9/11, life as I knew it began to return to normal by the following Sunday.
 Yes, there were some drastic changes. Major League Soccer canceled the final two weeks of '01 season. The playoffs, whose spots were already clinched by that point, were played as scheduled beginning Sept. 20.
 Major League Baseball and the NFL backed up their schedules as well.
 Some high school teams elected not to play on Friday, Sept. 14, 2001; others went ahead as usual.
 I drove to Clarksville three days after hijackers plowed jets into the World Trade Center to cover former Panthers coach Michael Banning in a nonconference game with visiting Lonoke. The country was still a little shaken up, but life soon returned to normal not long after the 9/11 attacks.
 But the bottom line was far simpler than what we're about to experience with the coronavirus.
 We weren't segregated from one another the way we are now -- or the way we'll be for the foreseeable future.
 How was your week that was? Complicated?
 I learned a new word I'd never really thought much about -- quarantine.
 When exactly this will end is anybody's guess.
 I've seen anywhere from two months to 18 months until things resume to our normal pace of life. Maybe longer.
 The next few weeks will really be important as we seek our normal lives. The most important thing for all of us is to understand the severity of the situation.
 Isolation is the only way.
 We've experienced widespread seasonal flu activity this winter. According to the Centers for Disease Control, there were 34,200 influenza deaths in the United States between 2018-19.
 And, while that number may sound big, there are many steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza, such as an annual flu shot.
 Common sense wins, too, when you wash your hands and cover your mouth. This year's influenza will also die out with spring giving way to summer.
 There are far more serious challenges with COVID-19 that we're behind the eight ball on. It's hard to know how really prepared we are or we'll need to be.
 Hopefully, the warm summer temps will slow the coronavirus epidemic the same way it does for influenza. But we need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually.
 I can attest as a parent that my own kids will be stronger for it. Then again, I discovered a long time ago that kids can be far more resilient than adults.
 I've always tried to portray a carefree approach when it comes to the sporting events I've covered over the years. When you've covered sports as long as I have, you're either in or out.
 I'm all in.
 But I have to admit, except for the 418 passes I heaved with my younger son Landon's football this week, rain and cold weather notwithstanding, it's been hard on this 58-year-old.
 Will it get better in the weeks to come?
 I sure hope so.

The national meteorologists are harmonizing and even the woodchuck concurred, that the winter of 2019-2020 was not only a mild one, but appears to be creating an early spring.
 If the weather patterns of the recent mild winter hold true to form through the spring, snow and cold will be gone earlier than usual.
 And if the expert's prognostications run true, May-like temperatures in April are going to make the turkey woods "green-up" quickly here in the Northeast.
 And that is not necessarily good for spring gobbler hunters.
 Sure, we all look forward to those warm spring hunts in May, cool dawns and maybe with a frost and quickly spreading sunshine and warmth by midday.
 But early springs in the past have shown us that the toms tend to hook up with their gal-friends weeks ahead of normal.
 And by the time hunting season opens May 1, here in New York state, the gobbler's breeding cycle has actually progressed a lot further along than usual.
 Spring gobbler season is timed by state game agencies to hit at the end of the first main breeding cycle of the wild turkey. That way, most of the hens will have been bred and on their nests by the time the season rolls around.
 And the theory in practice has worked well for the most part.
 Similarly, southern states start turkey hunting earlier; Florida in March, Virginia and Maryland in mid-April, and New York, May 1 as springtime and the gobble of the wild turkey moves northward.
 But one can't help but wonder if these same game agencies that are charged with regulating the wild turkey hunting seasons won't soon shift the dates, depending on latitude, to correspond with the changing climate.
 Here, hunters have to be out of the woods and quit hunting by noon for the first two weeks of the New York season to allow the nesting hens to incubate their clutches of eggs undisturbed by human intrusion.
 But this could be a non-issue this spring if most of the hens are setting weeks ahead of time.
 In what we used to call a normal year, as May progresses, toms typically become more difficult to call in, especially at the tail-end of their breeding season.
 Traditionally, if hunters had not been successful early, as the days of May ticked on towards June, filling a gobbler tag became increasingly problematical.
 Difficult, but not impossible.
 Turkey behavior is usually consistent and runs through the same basic patterns every year, certainly to a degree, weather-dependent.
 But turkeys do not go by our calendars.
 Last year, April and May here were extremely wet, inundating fields making it impossible for grasshoppers and early insects to hatch. Bugs are necessary food for turkey poults as they all hatch together.
 Many of the earliest turkey clutches failed last spring.
 But June warmed up.
 Hens were bred and nested again, as we noticed tiny turkey poults in mid- summer, the size of quail in late July and no larger than pigeons by August.
 Could they survive a harsh winter?
 Turkeys are resilient and certainly lucky because a mild fall has in 2019 has been followed by this record-setting mild winter.
 Throughout most of the year, from early summer through the fall and winter, gobblers will hang together in a brotherhood. They rarely interact with hens and poults (youngsters) unless at a preferred food source such as a heavy crop of mast in a beech grove or oak stand in the fall, or a freshly "manured" field in late winter. And sometimes hens and toms will roost near each other.
 Toms, like mature buck whitetails, are true bachelors, having nothing to do with rearing the young.
 But as spring arrives, this all-male behavior changes.
 Gobblers begin reinforcing their pecking order and shake the leafless woodlands with those raucous gobbles we so anticipate and seek.
 The tom's calls work on two levels. One, they challenge each other with vocal expressions of territoriality and two, the sound brings in the gals.
 But if the spring season is accelerated by a mild early spring as it appears set to happen this year, the toms will break up their bachelor groups quicker than usual and scatter, each tom or two carving out their preferred hillsides and woodlots.
 And if this year continues to warm early, then by the time the actual hunting season arrives a higher percentage of hens will already have been bred and the toms will not be as excited and callable as we would like or expect.
 Hoping for a cold March and April might seem harsh to many, but if it slows down the spring, it will bode well for gobbler hunters by structuring the wild turkey breeding season and hunting season to fall in line with our old normality.

As someone who has written about the Bears’ inability to produce compensatory draft picks longer than anyone else, I won’t dismiss their significance. Good teams have a way of producing them regularly, and when they do that year after year, those picks help. You raise some valid questions, but the Bears couldn’t keep Floyd, not at $13.2 million for 2020. Perhaps landing a fourth-round compensatory pick in the 2022 draft for losing Floyd in free agency a year from now was not a legitimate reason to keep him around. In two full seasons teamed with Khalil Mack, Floyd was unable to develop as a complementary pass rusher, and that failure canceled out the things he did well, such as drop in coverage and set the edge in the running game. You can’t perpetuate a draft miss — and that is what Floyd is when considering the team traded up to get him at No. 9 in 2016 — with the idea of a comp pick in 2022.

Virginia will keep schools closed through the rest of the school year, Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday afternoon.
 Most area schools had previously announced they would be closed through Easter due to the coronavirus outbreak.
 Northam said Monday school division leaders will decide how students will learn through the rest of the school year.
 On Tuesday, the state’s Department of Education will issue guidance to help school divisions work through those issues and address equitability, Northam said.
 Over the past few days, school divisions in Prince William, Loudoun, Fairfax and Stafford counties have alerted communities to staff, administrators or students who have tested positive for coronavirus.
 Riley O'Casey, president of the Prince William Education Association, told InsideNoVa on Monday that teachers are absolutely devastated to not be able to say goodbye to their students.
 "I'm just shocked," O'Casey said.
 She said it is an unprecedented situation.
 Prince William County Public Schools closed its schools from Saturday, March 14, to at least April 14. Now, administrators, teachers and staff, students and families are dealing with a new reality.
 O'Casey said there are many questions that come to mind after hearing Northam's decision, including if teachers will continue to get paid.
 Another issue she's mindful of is some students may not have access to the internet and have a digital device to access optional academic resources online. Prince William schools have issued some digital devices to some students, but not to all.
 On Friday, Prince William County Public Schools announced staff will not provide required instruction or give grades until at least April 14.

En un contexto de pandemia, las fake news tambien se propagan como un virus mortal. Desde la declaratoria de emergencia sanitaria, los temores sobre los efectos del Covid-19 incrementaron a la par de la diseminacion de rumores acerca de la nueva enfermedad. La Organizacion Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y autoridades sanitarias en los paises han advertido sobre los efectos nocivos de esparcir falsedades en torno al nuevo virus que ha cobrado la vida de alrededor de 13 mil personas a nivel global. Para contrarrestar la desinformacion, la OMS, incluso, activo un servicio de alertas por WhatsApp para enviar datos acerca de como evitar la expansion del virus y sobre la naturaleza de la nueva enfermedad, ademas de que publico informacion sobre mitos alrededor del coronavirus. De acuerdo con el Reporte de Noticias Digitales 2019 del Instituto Reuters para el Estudio del Periodismo, 67 por ciento de los usuarios de internet en Mexico se informan principalmente a traves de Facebook; 42 por ciento a traves de YouTube y 41 por ciento por WhatsApp. Manuel Alejandro Guerrero, director del departamento de Comunicacion de la Universidad Iberoamericana, dijo que la diseminacion de noticias falsas en el contexto de la pandemia representante un riesgo "muy alto" para la poblacion.

Estamos presenciando un escenario mundial complejo. Atravesamos la mayor crisis humana en la historia del mundo reciente y por ello tenemos que estar a la altura de las circunstancias. Este es un momento para cuidarnos todos, pero sobre todo, para ser solidarios.
 La presencia del coronavirus, Covid-19, en nuestro país es una realidad, y depende de cada uno de nosotros, de todos, la gravedad del impacto que está crisis tendrá en nuestra comunidad.
 Nos enfrentamos a una situación sin precedentes, que ha mostrado cómo países europeos han sufrido el colapso en sus sistemas de salud, e incluso han tenido que cerrar por completo todas sus actividades para evitar la propagación de la enfermedad.
 Esto debe generar conciencia en nosotros, de que para evitar el contagio, la responsabilidad es personalísima. Cada quien debe tomar las medidas para protegerse a sí mismo y a sus familias. Nadie nos puede sustituir en esta importante tarea. Hay que evitar ponernos en riesgo, especialmente a nuestros niños, adultos mayores y personas con padecimientos crónicos.
 Por otra parte, la recomendación realizada por la OMS, de promover el aislamiento social y quedarse en casa, también nos preocupa a todos en el ámbito local. Tan importante es proteger nuestra economía en tiempos de crisis, como lo es protegernos para evitar el contagio.
 Este panorama preocupa a miles de personas que diariamente salen a trabajar en los comercios locales para llevar el sustento a sus familias. Es en ese sentido, en el que éste también es un momento para la solidaridad, pues Chihuahua es nuestra casa común y debemos cuidarnos entre nosotros.
 Por eso invito a toda la comunidad chihuahuense a que no los dejemos solos. Si bien es fundamental seguir las medidas de protección y quedarse en casa, debemos encontrar alternativas para seguir consumiendo en los negocios locales. Podemos hacer uso de los diversos servicios de entrega a domicilio o hacer pedidos para llevar.
 Los representantes del sector restaurantero se han comprometido con los chihuahuenses para seguir de manera responsable las medidas de higiene y control, y así evitar la propagación de la enfermedad.
 Este es un momento para cuidarnos todos, pero sobre todo es un momento para la unidad como sociedad chihuahuense. Quienes gozan de seguridad financiera, ayuden a mantener viva la economía chihuahuense. Miles de familias en la ciudad lo necesitan. Que las grandes empresas ayuden a cobijar a los desamparados, pues son ellos quienes necesitan nuestro apoyo más que nadie.
 Debemos protegernos del coronavirus, cada quien con sus medidas en sus hogares, pero sobre todo debemos unirnos en solidaridad para enfrentar la crisis económica ocasionada por esta pandemia.
 Sí, el panorama es adverso, pero los chihuahuenses hemos demostrado históricamente que sí podemos.
 En nuestras venas corre la sangre de aquellos que enfrentaron situaciones de mayor complejidad en el pasado, así lo hicieron en emergencias como la batalla de Sacramento, y así lo hicieron de manera permanente con la lucha por la supervivencia en esta tierra árida e inhóspita.
 Los chihuahuenses hemos demostrado una y otra vez que somos gente trabajadora, gente solidaria, que se une cuando la adversidad golpea a nuestra puerta, y ahora nos toca a todos demostrar de qué estamos hechos.
 Con nuestra característica valentía, nuestra nobleza y nuestra lealtad a Chihuahua, vamos enfrentar esta contingencia, y como siempre, juntos vamos a salir adelante.

“What I'm really upset about is he's a physician, and he ought to know best in the whole Senate,” Emanuel told MSNBC.Paul defended his actions in a statement Monday. Since most senators travel frequently by plane and attend "lots of large gatherings, I believed my risk factor for exposure to the virus to be similar to that of my colleagues, especially since multiple congressional staffers on the Hill had already tested positive weeks ago,'' he said.“For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine, realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee, I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol,'' Paul added. Current federal guidelines would not have called for him to get tested or quarantined, Paul said."It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested,'' he said.Paul, 57, had surgery last year to remove part of a lung damaged in a 2017 assault by a neighbor who attacked him over a long-standing landscaping dispute. Paul broke several ribs in the incident and was later awarded $580,000 in damages and medical expenses.Paul said his decision to get tested was not related to his attendance at a Mar. 7 fundraiser for a Louisville art museum. Two event attendees have tested positive for COVID-19, but Paul said he "never interacted with the two individuals even from a distance.''“Perhaps it is too much to ask that we simply have compassion for our fellow Americans who are sick or fearful of becoming so.'' he said in the statement released by his office. "Thousands of people want testing. Many ... are sick with flu symptoms and are being denied testing. This makes no sense.''Paul went into quarantine Sunday after learning his results.His announcement led Utah’s two GOP senators — Mike Lee and Mitt Romney — to place themselves into quarantine, stepping away from negotiations as the Senate worked on a $1.4 trillion economic rescue package for the coronavirus crisis. At least five senators, including Paul, are in self-quarantine.Paul was on Capitol Hill this past week, including at a luncheon Friday among GOP senators. He spoke on the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon, addressing the cornonavirus and a failed amendment he sponsored that would have paid for virus relief efforts by withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan.A spokesman for Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said Moran briefly saw Paul at the Senate gym Sunday morning and shared that information with GOP colleagues. Moran “followed CDC guidelines and kept a safe distance between him and Sen. Paul,″ spokesman Tom Brandt said. Moran has spoken with the attending physician at the Capitol and has been told he does not need to self- quarantine, Brandt said.In a tweet Sunday, Sinema said Paul acted irresponsibly: "You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results. It endangers others &amp; likely increases the spread of the virus.″Other senators, including Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, had gone into self-quarantine while they awaited the results of a coronavirus test. Both were negative.A day after Paul’s announcement, calls grew among senators for remote voting. Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted that “I totally support” the idea and said the change should be made before the Senate leaves town. First-term Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., tweeted that “extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. It is time to bring the Senate into the 21st century.”Sens.

Anthony Fauci, the United States' top infectious disease expert, has led the country's response to every major epidemic since the outbreak of AIDS in the 1980s, long striving to ensure the science conveyed to the public is clear and accurate.
 As millions of Americans turn to him during the coronavirus pandemic, the physician-scientist has had to acquire a new skill: The art of delicately pushing back against the bluster of his boss, President Donald Trump, without saying he's wrong.
 Both men are in their seventies and both are proud of their New York upbringing -- but that's about where the similarities end.
 With his calm, professorial demeanor, pint-sized Fauci is fast becoming a household name as the evidence-driven straight shooter in the administration's coronavirus taskforce.
 During a televised meeting with pharmaceutical executives in early March, Trump -- who before he became president was famously skeptical of vaccines -- appeared to suggest one could be delivered to start immunizing the public against the virus in "three to four months."
 "You won't have a vaccine, you'll have a vaccine to go into testing," replied Fauci in the gravelly Brooklyn accent now familiar to the US public.
 "Like I've been telling you, Mr. President, a year to a year and a half," he added, spelling out a more realistic timeline for clinical trials to determine a vaccine has a sound scientific basis, is safe, and can be scaled.
 More recently Fauci has been tempering expectations about the prospects of antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, which Trump last week hailed as a "game changer" after the medicines showed early promise in small- scale studies in France and China.
 Asked a day later whether he agreed, Fauci stressed it was too early to say and that any "anecdotal evidence" still needs validation in randomized clinical trials.
 Fauci, for his part, has consistently downplayed these public yet polite disagreements, telling the respected Science magazine that he and Trump were largely in agreement on substance but mainly differed in emphasis.
 "The next time they sit down with him and talk about what he's going to say, they will say, by the way, Mr. President, be careful about this and don't say that," he said. "But I can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down."
 \- HIV pioneer -
 Born to Italian-American parents in Brooklyn, Fauci was drawn to health care because of his father, who was a pharmacist.
 He joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) -- the taxpayer-funded steward of medical and behavioral research -- in 1968, two years after receiving his medical degree from Cornell University, and began his career working on immune diseases.
 Over the summer of 1981, a flurry of reports landed on his desk about gay men suffering from immuno-compromised forms of pneumonia and cancer -- and he was struck with a shocking realization.
 "I actually remember getting goose pimples about it, because I'm saying, 'Oh my goodness, this is a new disease,'" he said in a 2011 interview.
 Fauci knew then it was urgent he shift his work's focus.
 In 1984, he was appointed director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAD), a position he holds to this day, having refused the role of NIH director four times under different presidents.
 During the 1980s, he became a lightning rod for criticism that the government was not doing enough to stem the rise of HIV-AIDS -- but rather than run from activists he took their views on board, a collaboration he told The Lancet was key.
 His accomplishments include implementing a fast-track system that widened access to antiretroviral medicines, and working with former president George H.W. Bush to plough in more resources.
 Under president George W. Bush, Fauci was the architect of the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), credited with saving millions of lives in sub-Saharan Africa.
 \- Just the facts -
 He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his work on AIDS in 2008 and more recently has overseen the US response to the Zika virus and Ebola.
 Fauci is credited with developing effective treatments for formerly fatal inflammatory diseases, as well as for contributions into understanding how HIV destroys the body's defenses.
 And in addition to overseeing his own lab, the 79-year-old continues to treat patients at the NIH's Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.
 For his current efforts, Fauci has been widely hailed as an "American hero" and a "national treasure," even as he refuses, as many Democrats might like, to criticize Trump more forcefully over what they see as the president's early reluctance to take major actions.
 Instead he likens the current scenario to a "fog of war" and consistently discourages Monday morning quarterbacking, or unfair criticism with the benefit of hindsight.
 "I don't want to act like a tough guy, like I stood up to the president," he told New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.
 "I just want to get the facts out. And instead of saying, 'You're wrong,' all you need to do is continually talk about what the data are and what the evidence is."

The youth were both at the same residential program, though OYA is not specifying which one. OYA has about 41 residential programs that are contracted out and provide services for youth who are on probation or parole in the community. Youth live onsite, but sometimes go into the community for school or work depending on the program. Some of the work programs have already been canceled, and Evans said they will evaluate the rest in light of Governor Kate Brown's newest executive order.

Before the regional emergence of coronavirus, more than 85,000 Yemenis had died from treatable diseases and malnutrition. Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the stalemated war, would lose face if he ended it without victory.

I don’t know that an extension for Robinson would affect this. The forecast strength of the draft at wide receiver has put a damper on action for the position in free agency. Smart agents probably did what they could to take care of their clients anticipating this. If the Bears see a speedy player who could fit into what they’re doing, maybe it’s worth kicking around. It’s a better idea to hit on one in the draft and have a player on a cost-controlled deal. The problem is the Bears haven’t done well at drafting wide receivers.

 In the days after 9/11, life as I knew it began to return to normal by the following Sunday.
 Yes, there were some drastic changes. Major League Soccer canceled the final two weeks of '01 season. The playoffs, whose spots were already clinched by that point, were played as scheduled beginning Sept. 20.
 Major League Baseball and the NFL backed up their schedules as well.
 Some high school teams elected not to play on Friday, Sept. 14, 2001; others went ahead as usual.
 I drove to Clarksville three days after hijackers plowed jets into the World Trade Center to cover former Panthers coach Michael Banning in a nonconference game with visiting Lonoke. The country was still a little shaken up, but life soon returned to normal not long after the 9/11 attacks.
 But the bottom line was far simpler than what we're about to experience with the coronavirus.
 We weren't segregated from one another the way we are now -- or the way we'll be for the foreseeable future.
 How was your week that was? Complicated?
 I learned a new word I'd never really thought much about -- quarantine.
 When exactly this will end is anybody's guess.
 I've seen anywhere from two months to 18 months until things resume to our normal pace of life. Maybe longer.
 The next few weeks will really be important as we seek our normal lives. The most important thing for all of us is to understand the severity of the situation.
 Isolation is the only way.
 We've experienced widespread seasonal flu activity this winter. According to the Centers for Disease Control, there were 34,200 influenza deaths in the United States between 2018-19.
 And, while that number may sound big, there are many steps you can take to protect yourself from influenza, such as an annual flu shot.
 Common sense wins, too, when you wash your hands and cover your mouth. This year's influenza will also die out with spring giving way to summer.
 There are far more serious challenges with COVID-19 that we're behind the eight ball on. It's hard to know how really prepared we are or we'll need to be.
 Hopefully, the warm summer temps will slow the coronavirus epidemic the same way it does for influenza. But we need to be as ready as we can for whatever comes our way and know that we will get through it eventually.
 I can attest as a parent that my own kids will be stronger for it. Then again, I discovered a long time ago that kids can be far more resilient than adults.
 I've always tried to portray a carefree approach when it comes to the sporting events I've covered over the years. When you've covered sports as long as I have, you're either in or out.
 I'm all in.
 But I have to admit, except for the 418 passes I heaved with my younger son Landon's football this week, rain and cold weather notwithstanding, it's been hard on this 58-year-old.
 Will it get better in the weeks to come?
 I sure hope so.
