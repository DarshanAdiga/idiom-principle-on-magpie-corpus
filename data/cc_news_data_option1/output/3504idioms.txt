Tom Terrific arrived in Port St. Lucie late, and he toured the camp in a chauffeured golf cart as though he were riding in a chariot. He reveled and waved the way Roman gods do and he was clearly pleased that he was Tom Seaver. At the end of the day, we newspaper writers waited in the dugout for our audience. He was late for that, too. I turned to Mike Vaccaro of the New York Post, who shared my age and Mets breeding, and I said, "I don't care who he is, I'm going to rip him." Vac nodded.
 When Seaver did finally take his seat on the dugout bench, he apologized. He was engaging and charming, but I knew with the insight of a now-jaded 29-year- old sportswriter that this was just the act that legends trot out for those on the outside.
 I wish I remembered what I said, but at one point I cracked a little joke and Tom Seaver broke up. Fully and loudly. I blushed. Vac leaned over and whispered, "That was awesome." I whispered back, "I know."
 No other living person could have made me feel that way. Batman could not have made me feel that way. The 8-year-old who had cried over a baseball trade was still there and couldn't wait to get to a phone to tell his parents, even if I had to make separate calls to do it.
 Tom Seaver thought I was funny. Tom Seaver would come to know my name. Tom Seaver would take my calls in the offseason. He told me about something funny his wife, Nancy, had said, about how his grapes had come in that summer, about how my son had to learn to slap that front foot down if he wanted to throw a great slider.
 Yes, Tom Seaver knew exactly how great he was, but he also knew his greatness was not his to keep to himself because it meant a considerable deal to people like me. He tended to his legend as he would his grapes, and I knew that he rode around the golf cart like Caesar because that's who the citizens of the Mets empire needed him to be, the greatest player from their greatest team.

 # A party for people would reform our broken system
 Roxanne Gihl, Bremerton
 On August 30th, something historic (hopefully!) happened. The Movement for a People's Party held their online convention, it went for five straight hours and was engrossing. If people and planet centered policies move you, and you're fed up with politics marinated with money, money, money -- their may be an alternative to the duopoly of Republicans and Democrats by 2024.
 I am sick of voting for the lesser of two evils, as both parties fail to rise to the occasion of a pandemic, millions lacking health care, mass unemployment, small businesses in peril, the alarm bells ringing on climate change non-stop. I don't hear any answers from the major parties to meet these challenges, and they only seem really interested in the donor and upper classes. This is an economic and moral dilemma as both parties seem to care less and less for the average person's welfare, and we are being conditioned to ignore lies, expecting less and less of our government. We have become numb from the daily shocks and distractions from a master manipulator.
 Government can do real good, if people with ethics and moral values take charge again. The People's Party may be just the beginning!

The biggest challenges in documenting how this targeting works is that neither the victims nor the perpetrators fit conventional categories for armed conflicts. I have served as an expert witness in nearly 100 asylum cases from Mexico in recent years. In some, there’s a public record of persecution — a federal law enforcement agent who had helped to arrest dozens of drug traffickers and survived an assassination attempt, or political activists who refused to be co-opted by organized crime in a region where dozens of their colleagues had been threatened and murdered. Other cases depend much more on the testimony of the asylum seeker and circumstantial evidence of the violence they describe — a woman held as a sex slave by a drug cartel, who witnessed dozens of rapes and murders, or a married couple who fled their hometown after the local crime boss decided to take the woman as personal property.
 The drafters of the Refugee Convention (1952), the Refugee Act (1980) and the Torture Convention (1984) surely didn’t imagine these exact scenarios. But our federal courts have repeatedly shown that the grounds for protection they defined apply in many situations they didn’t anticipate, and persecution need not be at the hands of a military dictatorship or a caricature of the Soviet Union.
 Taking these cases seriously would not open the floodgates. Undocumented immigration from Mexico is net zero since 2005 and net negative since 2009. More important, most victims of violence in Mexico do not want to leave — even when they have been chased out of their villages and had their houses burned down, when they’ve been kidnapped and tortured, or their spouses and children forcibly disappeared. In more than 250 long-form interviews with victims of violence and their surviving family members, I’ve heard exactly two mentions of seeking protection in the United States. When victims do leave, it’s generally a last resort and often an emergency.
 A man in Tijuana who had refused recruitment by a drug cartel was in the middle of being handed over by the police to organized crime when he escaped by jumping off of a pedestrian bridge into traffic, throwing himself at the mercy of a Department of Homeland Security security guard. Protection in the U.S. was a lifeline for a person who was specifically targeted, not a floodgate for anyone who wants to come.

 # Democracy is on the ballot
 June Cotner Graves, Poulsbo
 In regard to Dr. Slyter’s excellent letter published Sept. 1, I have a few more questions to add:
 Do you prefer a man who bullies others or one who treats others with respect? A man who incites racial division or one who works for racial justice?
 Do you prefer a man who disregards science regarding the coronavirus or a man who pledges to use science to overcome COVID-19? A man who calls climate change a “hoax” or one who regards global warming as an era-defining challenge and combating it as an economic opportunity?
 Do you prefer a man who is mocked by world leaders or a man who brings seasoned credentials to the world stage? An autocrat who states, “I alone can fix it” or a leader who says, “We’re all in this together”?
 Do you prefer a man who has filed for six bankruptcies and destroyed the U.S. economy or one who has a solid plan to make our economy stronger? A man who trusts a Russian dictator over his own country’s intelligence agencies or one who calls for immediate action to stop Russia from paying bounties on U.S. soldiers?
 Do you prefer a man who can only offer us the vastly diminished country we have now or a leader who will implement changes so we can feel healthy and safe again, go to work, attend school, worship, eat out with friends, raise our families; and lastly, a country in which we can enjoy peace, calm, and prosperity?

 # Tight-knit Tigers determined to kick off season with win over Ada
 Beau Bearden
 bbearden@gannett.com
 In such uncertain times, there’s no guarantee that athletes have enough time to become a tight-knit group as they did in previous seasons. But don’t tell that to the Ardmore High School football team, which has taken strides to be ready for its 2020 season opener at 7:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 4 against Ada at Noble Stadium.
 “Overall, the entire team has had a tremendous summer,” said Ardmore head coach Josh Newby. “We had great attendance, great effort and attitude. I like our locker room right now as far as the chemistry goes. We have a lot of good things going, we just have to execute on the field.”
 Only time will tell how Ardmore fares when it steps on the field, but it has extra motivation on its side after losing a close one to the Cougars in 2019.
 “Ada is very well coached, coach (Chris) Berus does a tremendous job,” Newby said. “Last year they beat us 7-0. We couldn’t score and they earned every bit of it. We’re excited about this year. We just know we have to execute offensively, play really good defense and hopefully we can get it done.”
 However, the Tigers will have a different signal caller under center in 2020 as Cal Swanson takes over the starting role. And the sophomore should have plenty of time to make plays with an experienced offensive line blocking for him.
 “The whole staff is excited about Cal,” Newby said. “He gives an opportunity to do things offensively that we haven’t been able to do around here in a long time. And he wants to play quarterback, which is half the battle. We’re very excited about him and his development.”
 Swanson’s progress will no doubt play a large role in Ardmore’s overall success, but that shouldn’t be an issue with a coaching staff that is prepared for whatever the opponent has planned.
 “Ada has a very good offensive scheme — they execute it very well,” Newby said. “And then defensively, coach (Mart) Leming, who runs their defense, always has those kids playing hard and in position. We have our hands full — our kids know it. But we’re excited and I know their kids will be excited, too.”
 And that excitement level is at an all-time high considering there could easily have been no 2020 football season for Oklahoma high schools. A number of other states have moved the sport to the spring, but not in the Sooner State.
 “With COVID going on, we’re just excited to have a ball game,” Newby said. “We’re going to appreciate every moment that we have. We all know that this could be taken away from us at any point in time, so we’re going to enjoy and cherish it. We’re only given 10 ball games a year and we work year-round for them, so every Friday night is special to our kids.”

The bones of “Mulan” remain familiar, though. We first see the character as a playful, acrobatic young girl (played by Crystal Rao), climbing up and leaping across rooftops in her village to chase a chicken in a bit of foreshadowing of the action to come. Her father (Ma, as warm a presence here as he was in “The Farewell”) seems proud of his daughter’s plucky nature, but her mother (Rosalind Chao) reminds her that “a daughter brings honor through marriage.” A meeting with a matchmaker (the veteran Pei-Pei Cheng) that goes comically wrong is one of many indications that a traditionally servile, female path is not in Mulan’s future.
 When invaders led by the villainous Bori Khan (Jason Scott Lee) threaten the emperor (Jet Li) years later, the imperial army fans out across China to amass soldiers to protect the palace, gathering one man from each family. Mulan’s family has no sons, so her father—a wounded warrior himself—must join to maintain honor. Instead, Mulan grabs his sword and rides her horse under cover of darkness, reporting for duty to the stern commander (Yen) with her hair tucked under a cap and her voice slightly lowered. In the tradition of gender- bending movies ranging from “Yentl” to “Just One of the Guys,” Mulan must find convoluted ways to avoid changing clothes and showering in front of her fellow soldiers, including the handsome Honghui (Yoson An), with whom she enjoys a verbal and physical spark. She also struggles to avoid the shapeshifting sorceress Xianniang (Gong Li), Bori Khan’s menacing right-hand woman who keeps finding her. Despite her malevolent nature, she and Mulan have more in common than the young woman would like to admit, and the complicated and uncomfortably honest nature of their relationship gives the film an intriguing, feminist spark. (Li also gets to wear the most fabulously ornate costumes, including ones inspired by Xianniang’s ability to transform herself into a hawk.)
 But the movie loses some momentum when it’s about the actual nuts and bolts of the plot against the emperor. Sure, it’s the narrative machinery that drives Mulan’s transformation, but it gets bogged-down and talky, and it’s not nearly as compelling as the character’s ultimate acceptance of her undeniable inner strength. The regal and fierce Xianniang has her number early on, and when they finally meet each other for battle, she wisely tells Mulan: “Your deceit weakens you. It poisons your qi.” There’s a bit of a Darth Vader-Luke Skywalker, love-hate dynamic to this showdown, but the underlying truth of that statement resonates. Her feminine strength has made her an outcast in this male-dominated world, but she recognizes that Mulan can’t achieve her own full potential until she’s fully honest about her identity.

LeVert has shown that he can be the third star the Nets are looking for, but his readiness, fit and injury history (he's only played more than 57 games once in four seasons) are all question marks for the Nets as they look to become a true championship contender. He is mostly effective with the ball in his hands, which could limit his ceiling playing alongside Durant and Irving. He's a good 3-point shooter, but has been better off the dribble than in catch-and-shoot situations.
 LeVert's trade value is at an all-time high, but the health issues are certainly on the radar of any team interested in acquiring him, which means the Nets may have to dig deeper into their treasure chest in any prospective deals. Maybe they have to part ways with promising young big man Jarrett Allen or eliminate some of their depth by including wings like Garrett Temple and/or Taurean Prince.
 Durant and Irving are slated to make over $73 million combined next season. Does bringing in another large salary mean they can't match the expected high price tag for unrestricted free agent Joe Harris, a sharpshooter who's a perfect fit alongside the two superstars? With Durant coming off an Achilles injury and Irving having missed significant time in six of his nine NBA seasons, the Nets have to think long and hard about whether sacrificing their depth for another star is a prudent move.

The coronavirus pandemic has shut down most of our country and, along with it, our asylum system. With a March 20 order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention restricting crossing at our southern border, almost all individuals fleeing violence and persecution have been prevented from seeking safe haven in the United States. But the reshaping of our asylum system was in the works long before the pandemic.
 Since 2017, an onslaught of anti-immigrant policies has chipped away at the legally enshrined right to apply for asylum. One of these policies clandestinely changed the very first step of the asylum process: the “credible fear” interview, which determines whether people seeking asylum can continue in their journey to access life-saving protection in the United States or instead be turned away.
 For many people, the “credible fear” interview marks the beginning of the lengthy process to seek asylum in the U.S. Only those who pass the interview can present their full claims to an immigration judge. The standard is intentionally low, so that people with a genuine fear are not summarily deported back to persecution or death. In the interview, people seeking asylum must often provide painful details of the persecution they have experienced. These threshold screenings are meant to be conducted in a non-adversarial and safe setting by asylum officers who are experts in asylum law and specially trained to work with victims of trauma. And for decades, that is how these interviews were conducted.
 Last year, however, the federal government — acting through officials who were unlawfully appointed — started to allow some U.S. Border Patrol agents to conduct these sensitive interviews. Although it is not clear yet whether Border Patrol agents have conducted “credible fear” interviews everywhere, “pilot programs” like this often expand to become the norm throughout the border region.

And it's that Nets roster that promises to be one of the more intriguing storylines of the offseason. In January, Irving said that the Nets had "glaring" personnel issues that needed to be addressed in the summer (now the fall or winter). The comment only reinforced the theory that general manager Sean Marks and the Nets would go big-game hunting at some point in an effort to add another star next to Irving and Durant.
 It remains to be seen who will be on the market, but Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal, who averaged a career-high 30.5 points this season, has been brought up as a possible Brooklyn target. Another name mentioned is New Orleans Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday. But acquiring either of them will come at a cost, one that most likely involves parting ways with budding star Caris LeVert.
 There have been a few breakout performances in the bubble, but LeVert's might have been the most exciting to watch. Not only did he improve his scoring from 17.7 points to 25 points per game as the team's top offensive option in the seeding games, but he also displayed adept playmaking ability, bumping his assists from 4.1 per game to 6.7. In the first-round sweep at the hands of a tenacious Toronto Raptors defense, LeVert averaged 20.3 points and 9.5 assists per game on 43 percent 3-point shooting.

 # Comets looking to bounce back on the road at Comanche
 Beau Bearden
 bbearden@gannett.com
 One of the toughest feelings in any sport is losing your final game of the season and missing the playoffs. The Dickson High School football team experienced that anguish in 2019, but it will have a chance at redemption at 7:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 4 when it travels to Comanche.
 “You take it week by week, but for me (Comanche is) one of the games that I kind of had circled on my schedule just because they knocked us out of the playoffs last year,” said Dickson head coach Steve Day. “I have a little bit of a chip on my shoulder as far as that goes. You like to think we’ll be fired up for this one. If we’re not, there’s probably something wrong with us.”
 But it’s not likely that Day needs to provide any extra motivation for this group, especially after a tough 22-2 loss last Friday at Hugo. Dickson gave itself a number of opportunities to put points on the scoreboard, but couldn’t find paydirt.
 “The defense played well — they played about as well as they could,” Day said of last Friday. “Offensively, we had three touchdown passes that were dropped. So obviously if you score those, it’s a different ball game and maybe we wear them down a little bit more or we play with a little bit more momentum — however you want to view it. But it is what it is. You don’t always make every play. You have to learn from it and move on.”
 The Comets have no choice but to look ahead, as the Indians are also looking to get their first win of 2020 in their season opener.
 Dickson may have a small advantage though.
 “Our first game jitters are out of the way and maybe they have some of that and maybe they don’t,” Day said. “But at the end of the day, after a few plays, you’re playing. I’m hoping that we can just play well and execute both game plans on offense and defense and be solid on special teams.”
 If the Comets excel in all three phases of the game, they should be in good shape for a victory. That is not guaranteed, especially against a gritty Comanche defense.
 “They’re not huge up front on the defensive line, they’re very, very aggressive,” Day said. “They have two athletic linebackers that play well. And their secondary is pretty quick. They’re pretty ball savvy and they have good technique.”
 However, Dickson doesn’t expect to see many trick plays or complex schemes as the Indians are focused on the basics.
 “On offense and defense, they don’t run a whole lot of stuff,” Day said. “They just run what they do, and they just do it really, really well. We know what they’re going to do, it’s just a matter of executing our game plan versus theirs.”

At the center is the lovely Yifei Liu, who’s called upon to show a great deal of range as Mulan transforms herself from brazen, impetuous rebel to mature, commanding leader. Just as important is the fact that she finds her voice over the course of this journey—a phenomenon specific to this character and this story, but one that couldn’t be more resonant for women of all ages watching all over the world, right now. Liu’s performance might have been more powerful if she’d been a bit more emotive, but the steeliness and physicality she displays make her a convincing fighter.
 Caro is a perfect choice to helm this live-action “Mulan,” having made her name nearly two decades ago with another story of a determined girl who dared to buck the patriarchy, 2002’s “Whale Rider.” Working from a script by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver and Elizabeth Martin & Lauren Hynek, Caro interweaves the story’s ancient poetic roots with Easter eggs from the 1998 animated film—although there’s no wacky dragon sidekick, alas—but it’s very much its own artistic endeavor, and is by far the most effective and necessary of all the live-action remakes of Disney’s animated catalog that we’ve seen in recent years.
 Caro’s take on the tale, as mainstream and family-friendly as it is, also carries the unmistakable spirit of the #MeToo movement: women standing up for themselves and each other and demanding that men hear and believe them. One particular moment of solidarity and validation caused my heart to get caught in my throat, and it’s one of many instances that made me wish I was watching “Mulan” in a packed theater. As gorgeous as the film is—the work of countless talented women behind the scenes, including cinematographer Mandy Walker and costume designer Bina Daigeler—it’s not quite the same watching it at home, even on a giant TV, even with an enthusiastic, movie-loving kid on the couch next to you.

"Being in the clubhouse, it's a lot different. Really don't spend that much time together," Trout said. "The team chemistry plays a big part in all this. Not being able to do things together in the clubhouse, play cards or have a little group setting, it's tough."

I have returned with some regularity over the years to compare what is going on in our country today to what was going on in the 1850s, the years preceding the Civil War.
 America has always been about freedom of expression. And that freedom has often led to protests and tension. Generally, we've gotten through these tough and challenging times and moved on.
 But what caused everything to break down in the 1850s, leading to a horrible Civil War?
 The answer, I think, is to understand the distinction between plurality of opinions and plurality of values.
 Plurality of opinion is natural and vital to human reality and why freedom and democracy are so important. Each individual is unique and sees the world in his or her unique way. Each must be able to bring his or her own unique perspective, his or her own opinion, to the table.
 But plurality of values is different altogether. In order to have the dialogue necessary to tolerate plurality of opinion, we must be on the same page. We must have the same core values.
 When we no longer have any common ground in our most basic beliefs, in our most basic values, we lose all basis of being able to communicate and conduct civil discourse.
 We may have different opinions about health care, education, foreign policy and climate change.
 But in the 1850s, the differences were about the nature of man, whether blacks were human beings and whether slavery should be tolerated.
 This is a breakdown in common values, not in opinion. Once the most common values were gone, the basis for civil discourse was gone, and the country broke into war, with brother killing brother.
 Current tensions are supposedly about police brutality, though I think this is a smoke screen.
 Police brutality is indeed a problem. And it is possible to have civil discourse about how to deal with this problem.
 I have written about it. One issue is police unions. The unions make it almost impossible to take meaningful punitive action against officers with a track record of poor behavior.

Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy and his assistant coaches will put on a few pots of coffee and work into the night behind closed doors.
 The Bears are finally on the verge of a quarterback decision between Nick Foles and Mitchell Trubisky. They will be watching loads of training camp film, with a decision coming possibly Sunday or even sooner on who starts the season opener against the Detroit Lions.
 “I would say this: It is not easy,” Nagy said. “It’s not clear cut.”
 If the idea was to produce a lopsided winner, the Bears have come up short.

The AAV with 16 service members on board wouldn't have traveled off the sand before a standard "pre-water ops" checklist was completed, which would include inspections by a launch team to make sure the vehicle was watertight and that anything mechanical and essential to staying afloat was operational. Typically checked are whether plenum doors, which control airflow, are secure, if bilge pumps are functioning, if hull plugs are in place and if the big propellers that move the track are working.

“You’re also meeting a lot of new people and trying to build those relationships and learn their names while also learning the area, so all that pulls from your energy. It’s not the first time that I’ve done it, but it’s most expedited, I would say.”
 Trubisky had a long way to go after a passer rating of 83.0 last year, 12.4 points below his mark in 2018 when the Bears won the NFC North. He thinks he made his improvement apparent.
 “I think overall, just showing that I’ve improved throwing the ball downfield in situations with the team and one-on-one (drills) and routes, just showing that I could make better decisions with the football for the offense ... and being more accurate, especially out and to the left and outside the numbers,” Trubisky said. “I think I’ve shown that I can make those throws and I’ve done better with my footwork, and just being able to lead and run this offense.”
 NOTES: Defensive end Akiem Hicks returned to practice Thursday for the first time since Aug. 20 after getting past a quad muscle injury. ... The Bears have wide receiver Allen Robinson available now after an ankle sprain earlier in camp, but starting running back David Montgomery remains out with a groin strain and his name is likely to show up on the injury report next week.

So if the Brooklyn Nets, who recently brought in Nash to coach Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, are earnestly looking to add another star to the mix, they need look no further than their recent hire for the ultimate cautionary tale.
 Nash, who has no head-coaching experience and limited NBA coaching under his belt (he was a consultant with the Golden State Warriors, where he built a relationship with Durant), will be given the nearly unattainable task of leading a team to a title in his first season. The parallels to Steve Kerr, who was able to accomplish the feat, are obvious: They were both hired without previous assistant coaching experience. They were both great shooters. They're about the same height. They have the same first name.
 Their rosters, however, couldn't be more different. While Kerr inherited a young team with homegrown stars on the cusp of greatness, Nash signed on with two veteran superstars who have already won titles but have combined to play only 20 games with the organization.

“You get these boxes with 15,000 bees in them,” said Paul Butler of Macon, who has four hives. “The bees will stay with their queen. You take her out of the box and put her in the hive. You basically dump the bees in the hive and put the lid on and wait.”
 Bees don't want to sting people, Butler said. The one time they get annoyed is when someone is taking their honey. He's been stung enough times that he's developed an allergy to the stings, so he takes precautions when he has to work with the hives — taping down his pant legs, heavy gloves, a hood.
 “I'm pretty allergic to bees, but I like them a lot,” he said.

 # Don't tolerate the divisive voices destroying our nation
 Sandy Mori, Amakusa, Japan
 Have we lost our way, America? Are we being played by media moguls and advertisers who are competing for our attention? Is divisiveness a tactic that is being exploited by these giants to create a sense of urgency, insecurity and helplessness as it seductively holds us captive?
 I suggest that entertainment being sold as news has been disruptive by challenging us to doubt our solidarity. Have we been too tolerant of the mud- slinging by news outlets and their advertisers whose coverage of their perceived political rivals tends to be biased and one-sided. As one who is presently overseas, I can see the toll that a polarized press has had on our nation. I have a plea.
 During this election season, America, please reclaim our common story -- our history, our dignity, our integrity and resolve to work together.
 At the end of the day, in the absence of us saying, “NO!” to the divisiveness, “NO” to the cynicism, “NO” to the contempt, America will cease to be America. This may offend some, but it is central to my point. Our tolerance of vitriol especially when it comes out of the mouth of our president is a concern. Vitriol begets hostility and if we continue to engage each other with hate, our dreams die.
 Use your voices and cast your ballots now. Our challenge is whether we will we say “No” to what destroys a nation and work to rebuild.
