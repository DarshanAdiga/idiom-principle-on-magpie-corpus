You look at Max Guenther, who became the youngest ever Formula E race winner last time out for BMW i Andretti Motorsport, could he continue his transition into looking a pretty special driver we all hope he can become.
 But on the other hand, you’ll have a few characters heading into this race with a bead or two of sweat on their head after having a bit of a nightmare last year.
 I love Pascal Wehrlein, he’s one of my top-five favourite lads on the track – he’s young, he’s funky and I think he could be a real poster boy for Formula E and I was as gutted as anyone by his last second loss of the race win to Di Grassi last year after running out of usable energy on the line.
 It was just a misjudgement, but it shows the fine margins in Formula E and he’ll want to be spot-on this year. Same goes for Nissan e.dams who ran out of usable energy with a whole lap to go. It was a huge miscalculation and Sebastien Buemi was absolutely mortified; I saw him afterwards and he couldn’t believe it.

CARVER - Monday's 4-1 victory over Dennis-Yarmouth delivered Wareham/Carver hockey's third trip to the tournament in Coach Rich Valatkevicz's five-year tenure. The 10-6-1 Vikings have three regular season games left to sharpen their step heading into postseason play.
 "It's been great to have the chance to get back there again. It's been a great run. It was a team effort and it feels great to get back there again this year," Valatkevicz said coming off the Dennis-Yarmouth win.
 A big moment came earlier in the week for junior Tyler Lovendale, who scored his 100th career point in the Vikings' 7-6 loss to Somerset Berkley. He became the third player in Carver school history to do so, and Valatkevicz recognized how he has impacted the program.
 "He's been absolutely huge for the program. He's a great kid. The last three years I've given him the sportsmanship award. He's a quiet kid and he doesn't say a lot, but he goes out and does his job every night, (he) never complains. He'll do whatever I ask him to do. If I asked him to go down to the second line, he's like 'whatever it takes, coach, to win a hockey game'. That's the type of player you want. Very coachable, no question about it."
 As the tournament approaches, the Vikings have won four of their last five games, and it has been due to stifling play on the defensive side of the puck, both by the defensemen and senior goaltender Alex DeMarco. In their last three victories, they have given up three total goals, one per contest, showing off their defensive prowess in the latter half of the regular season.
 "It's probably (been) a combination (of defensemen and DeMarco). Alex has had some great games again this year, some shaky starts. I think the team overall has had some shaky starts, but we turn it on through the second and third. I think recently, finally, like I told them, put 45 minutes in. Not 15, not 30, but just go out and play hard and I think we have in the past three or four games or so. Again, it's good timing as the season is coming closer to an end and we need this run to play as hard as we can," he said.
 The team had a bit of an up and down start to the season, hanging around the .500 mark at the beginning and turning it up as the season dwindles to its end at this point of the year, but overall, it's been nothing short of yet another successful season for the team as a whole, but the job isn't done.
 Wareham/Carver finds itself in the midst of a battle in the South Coast League standings with teams like Apponequet and Seekonk as Somerset Berkley looks overhead, perched at a league best 14-3. Seekonk, Apponoquet, and Wareham/Carver are all within a game of each other in the standings, but the Vikings have done their part to put up a fight, even if the head-to-head record doesn't indicate it. The Vikings are 1-5 against those three teams this season, but it's been close on the scoreboard. The team has been one goal short against each of those squads this season, suffering a 5-4 loss to Seekonk early in the year, a 4-3 loss to Apponequet, and most recently, a 7-6 loss to Somerset Berkley earlier this week. A couple of bad breaks, and slow starts as Valatkevicz mentioned, could've flipped those one goal losses in the other direction.
 Although the team is making its way to the tournament once again, some pressure is surely applied based off the group out there on the ice. Many of the top players will leave the team at season's end, so capitalizing on the opportunity at hand is vital for the players and coaching staff. Making the most of veteran pieces will be the key to moving on throughout each round. DeMarco, along with one of the team's high-volume scorers Quirino doCanto, and a key member of the team's trusted defensive lines, Brian Gallagher, are all seniors and will graduate this spring, making this playoff run even more important to cap off their careers on a high note.
 "Absolutely (there is some pressure), losing Q, Alex, and Gallagher, on defense, they're three key players that definitely make an impact on the team. All three of them are huge parts to the team. It's going to be hard to replace all three. When one of your top scorers (is) going, your top goaltender, and top defensemen, they will be hard to replace. I'm just hoping these kids, the ones coming up, (will) be able to step into a good role in the next year or so. I lose them, but I'll have some good players. I should be able to have some good lines, I think goaltending will be the question."
 To close out the regular season, the Vikings square off against the league's surprise team, Bourne, followed by a two-game homestand against Monomoy and Upper Cape Tech. Valatkevicz commented on what it's going to take to finish off the regular season on top.
 "An overall team effort, that's the biggest thing. I think they need to come together as a team. They need to realize what they're going to face. I think, the way I'm looking at it, Bourne, for the first time, they're in the heart of the tournament for the first time in years, but they're going to give us a hard time. They're going to want to beat us, they're going to come after us."

The Indian rupee on Friday fell by 6 paise to close at 71.37 (provisional) against the US dollar tracking heavy selling in domestic equities and strengthening of the American currency in the overseas market.
 Forex traders said the rupee consolidated in a narrow range as strengthening of the US dollar, rise in crude oil prices and heavy selling in domestic equities weighed on the local unit.
 At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened on a positive note at 71.29. During the day, it lost ground and touched a low of 71.41 and finally settled 6 paise lower at 71.37 against the US currency.
 The domestic unit had settled at 71.31 against US dollar on Thursday.
 On a weekly basis, the rupee has gained 3 paise.
 “Along with stronger American dollar, series of weak domestic economic data and higher crude oil prices weighed on Indian rupee in today’s session,” said V.K. Sharma, Head PCG and Capital Markets Strategy, HDFC Securities.
 Sharma further noted that “spot USDINR has been consolidating in the range of 70.70 to 71.12, the high and low of January months. We believe rupee can hold the same range this month in absence of new triggers”.

“We’ve been decent at it,” McDonald said. “It’s been a little while. The three games we had last week weren’t close games. It’ll be interesting to see how we respond to that, with the fact that we’re on the road, against a physical opponent, who will come after us.
 “They want to get some momentum as they head into the middle of February.”
 The last game Hibbing closed out was Orono, which it won by 15. All three games last week were blowouts.
 “I don’t think we’ve had a game that’s come down to the wire in a long time,” McDonald said. “You always think about those one- or two-possession games are the ones you have to close out. There’s no question that’s the case.
 “It’s also difficult to take anything away from our guys because they have done some good things in this stretch to avoid having that tight game.”
 One of those games was the Greenway game. The Raiders were hanging around, but Hibbing pulled away and won by 30.
 “You’re under the misconception that closing out games means you win a nail- biter,” McDonald said. “Closing out games can also mean making an eight-game a 15-point game, or a 10-point game a 20-point game.
 “When you look at it from that perspective, we’ve done a good job with that.”
 The Bluejackets enter the game on a five-game winning streak, and they’ve won 7-of-their-last-9-games, but they haven’t hit the court since Feb. 6.
 “It’s been awhile since we played, so hopefully, we’re ready to go,” McDonald said. “We can’t think about Saturday too much and not concentrate on enough on this one, which is first in line.”

Riding a seven-game winning streak and alone atop the conference standings, No. 9 Maryland (20-4, 10-3) seeks to keep the momentum going at Michigan State (17-8, 9-5) on Saturday night. The Terrapins were winless on the road and mired in a two-game skid before getting on a roll behind sophomore forward Jalen Smith, who's had a double-double in seven straight outings to help Maryland become the first Big Ten team to reach the 20-win plateau. Maryland's streak includes victories at Northwestern, Indiana and Illinois. The Spartans ended a three-game slide with a last-second 70-69 victory at Illinois on Tuesday night, and now have the opportunity to get within a game of the first- place Terps. The teams meet again on Feb. 29 at Maryland, where the Terrapins are undefeated. So this is pretty much a must-win situation for the Spartans if they hope to have a shot at top seed in the Big Ten Tournament.

 In a major speech in her hometown Ms Long-Bailey told how she was “devastated watching the results come in across the Red Wall” - constituencies in Labour’s traditional heartlands which fell to the Tories.

 Claiming she has “great respect and admiration for the other candidates”, she said while backbench hopeful Lisa Nandy “has laid out a solid analysis of why we lost ... I’ve not heard from her yet what the answer is”.
 She hailed Mr Starmer’s “rigorous and detailed at the Despatch Box”.

Papa Massata Diack, the son of former world athletics supremo Lamine Diack, has denied corruption linked to the Russian doping scandal, saying he is too rich to bribe.
 Diack has been indicted by French prosecutors for allegedly accepting millions of dollars along with his father, Lamine Diack, in return for covering up positive Russian doping tests.
 Diack junior is a former marketing consultant for the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), now renamed World Athletics, which was run by his father from 1999 to 2015.
 He was due to go on trial in Paris from mid-January along with his father but has refused to cooperate with French authorities and remains in Senegal.
 Despite two international arrest warrants issued by France, the Senegalese authorities have said they will not extradite Diack junior.
 In testimony to an investigating magistrate in Senegal in November, seen by AFP, Papa Massata Diack said he was too wealthy to need to take bribes and denied covering up positive Russian doping tests from 2011.
 "In all the years I worked with the IAAF and Dentsu-AMS (the IAAF marketing rights holders), I earned around 10 millions dollars (nine million euros) from sponsoring contracts and TV rights," he testified.
 "So I had no need to ask athletes to pay money for doping cases."
 The testimony, given on November 7, was sent by Senegal authorities to Paris along with other documents related to the case, but arrived too late to permit the trial to go ahead on the original date.
 The presiding magistrate in the trial said more time was needed to examine that testimony. The trial is now set to start in June.
 \- Unauthorised payments -
 In his testimony, Diack, 54, denied all allegations against him including taking unauthorised payments to the tune of millions of dollars for TV contracts.
 Separately, father and son are also being investigated by French authorities in a related case concerning the allocation of major athletics events and two Olympic Games.
 Diack senior, 86, acknowledged during the investigation over Russian doping that sanctions against Russian athletes had been put on hold to allow them to compete at the 2012 London Olympics and the 2013 world athletics championships in Moscow.
 Russia has been suspended from international competition since 2015 after proof emerged of a vast state-backed doping conspiracy.
 Diack senior said that in exchange for help covering up doping, Moscow paid more for TV and sponsorship rights and also paid out 1.5 million euros to the Senegalese opposition to help defeat then-Senegal president Abdoulaye Wade when he stood for re-election in 2012.
 Diack junior, however, denied knowledge of the political donation.
 The French justice system considers that it has jurisdiction in the cases because it suspects the son, Papa Massata Diack, of laundering money Paris.

 Last season there were the usual complaints about the qualifying format, which sends out the top of the Championship first, but I feel this year the really good teams and drivers might prove themselves with a bit more regularity on the podium.

Olympic chiefs admitted Friday they face a “very big communications job” to soothe concerns over the coronavirus epidemic in the run-up to this summer’s Tokyo Games.
 The head of the International Olympic Committee coordination commission insisted there was no danger of Tokyo 2020 being cancelled or moved, despite fears over the fast-spreading virus which has killed nearly 1,400 and infected around 64,000 – most of them in China.
 But he said the IOC will send out information packs to reassure athletes that it’s safe to come into contact with competitors from China.
 “The advice we have received from the World Health Organization is that there is no case for a contingency plan to cancel or move the Games,” John Coates told reporters after a project review meeting.
 “Certainly it’s a very big communications job that needs to be undertaken,” he added, noting that China is set to send more than 600 athletes to Tokyo.
 “But we hear that most of the Chinese athletes are now out of China. I don’t know how many were to be involved in test events here, but I don’t see a problem if they’re coming from another country.”
 Coates promised lessons would be learned from Rio four years ago, when concerns over the mosquito-born Zika virus led to several top athletes pulling out of the Olympics, including golfers Jason Day and Rory McIlroy.
 “The WHO pointed out the likelihood of Zika being a problem at the time of the Games was very low,” he said. “But we did lose some athletes – Jason Day’s wife was pregnant. We didn’t communicate the information well enough.”
 Tokyo organisers have slammed “fake news” and scare-mongering over the coronavirus outbreak for causing panic ahead of the Games, which open on July 24.
 More than 25 countries have confirmed cases of the flu-like disease, which the WHO has declared a global health emergency.
 ## ‘Tokyo 2020 on track’
 Japan, which registered its first fatality on Thursday of someone who had tested positive for the virus, is one of the worst-hit countries outside of mainland China.
 There have been 33 cases on land and more than 200 positive tests of people quarantined on a cruise ship floating off Yokohama since last week.
 Coates conceded that there could be fear among athletes about facing competitors from China.
 “We did talk about that,” said the Australian.
 “The IOC is going to ensure (information) kits are sent to all national committees to explain what’s happening around the world where Chinese athletes are competing,” he added.
 “But I can confirm Tokyo 2020 remains on track,” insisted Coates, who revealed IOC president Thomas Bach will lay a wreath at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park on the sidelines of the May 19-20 executive project review.
 The virus has already impacted sporting events in Asia, including Olympic qualifiers for boxing and basketball – both in China.
 Formula One’s Shanghai Grand Prix, scheduled to take place in April, has been postponed with the inaugural Vietnamese Grand Prix also under threat.
 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government has come under fire for its handling of the infection, especially quarantine measures seen as too lax in the early stages of the epidemic.
 “We don’t yet know who will be competing at test events so we can’t say anything for sure,” said Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto, when pressed to specify measures being taken to tackle the epidemic.
 “But we will have information from the qualifiers that are under way and take the necessary steps.”

The Montrose Regional Library recently hosted the annual book unveiling of the Libraries of Montrose County Foundation. This year had the most books ever funded by the Foundation. The party was excellent with music provided by Emily Johannessen and catering from the Stone House.
 This year the generous donors to the Libraries of Montrose County Permanent Book Funds provided more than $19,000 worth of items for libraries in Montrose County. This money allowed us to provide 1,160 items for library users that they would not have had without the willingness to give by the donors. I want to thank them for their support, support that will continue providing much needed resources for many years to come.
 In the past year we have added five new permanent book funds. The balance in the endowment fund stands at $543,000. Montrose is a generous community when they believe in the cause, and there is a lot of support for the library. Those of us working with the foundation strive to prove to you the worth of our cause.
 When I envisioned creating the foundation over 16 years ago, it was with tight budgets in mind. In good years, the foundation provides more items for our book budget that are like frosting on the cake. In hard times, the foundation helps make the cake. In fact, last year the foundation provided almost 10% of our entire materials budget. Lets face it, if we don’t have stuff to lend out, we aren’t much of a library. The foundation has been a huge help. The foundation is long term thinking and a long-term solution.
 You can help long term by supporting the Libraries of Montrose County Foundation. One way to support the Foundation is through a Permanent Book Fund. A Book Fund donation goes into the Libraries of Montrose County Foundation's endowment fund and provides money for books and materials in perpetuity. A donation of $2,500 sets up a book fund. The foundation is set up to spread this donation over five years and can do so through automatic withdrawals, which makes it a payment of less than $42 per month.
 Many people have gotten creative with Permanent Book Funds over the years. Groups of individuals have banded together for a common cause to create a fund. One subdivision holds a fundraiser like a neighborhood cookout every year to raise money for their fund. Another group donates money in honor of a man who touched all of their lives.
 Another way to help is through the foundation’s new scholarship program. The Board of Directors of the Libraries of Montrose County Foundation believe that reading opens up a lifetime of information, inspiration, and pleasure to those who make reading a lifelong habit. To encourage reading, the foundation is offering a college scholarship based on reading great literature and thinking seriously about its content.
 The foundation will award one $5,000 scholarship per year for up to four years of a college career, so it is possible to be awarded a total of $20,000 for your entire collegiate journey. Applicants must read three books from the Literature for Life Scholarship Reading Lists and submit three essays, two of which will demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the books read and the last will describe the applicant’s educational goals and needs for financial aid. Applications will be evaluated by readers with an academic background. Awards will be made by the foundation board from a group of finalists recommended by the application readers.
 If you would like more information about either of these programs, please do not hesitate to contact me at the library.

Stamani alle verso le 5 i Vigili del Fuoco di Bracciano, sono intervenuti presso il comune di Cerveteri in via Doganale altezza del civico 236 per un incidente stradale. Una ragazza a bordo di uno scooter, per cause da accertare, ha perso il controllo del mezzo ed è caduta. Alcuni automobilisti di passaggio hanno prestato i primi soccorsi in attesa dell'ambulanza. Sul posto è giunto il personale sanitario che ha provveduto a trasportare l'infortunata in ospedale, e una pattuglia dei carabinieri di Civitavecchia.

 I was catching up with Sam Bird this week and he said a race of this length and in this the heat could mean it could end up being all about energy preservation.

When senior government officials abuse their power by wielding law enforcement for private ends, whether to attack their enemies or protect their allies, they strike at the heart of constitutional democracy. They make a mockery of "equal justice under law," the central animating principle of the American experiment.
   
 That principle distinguishes liberal democracies based on the rule of law from autocracies in countries like Egypt, Russia and Venezuela -- or from crumbling democracies in places like Hungary.
   
 President Donald Trump, with his authoritarian nature, does not respect any of this. From basking in "lock her up" chants during the 2016 campaign to attacking his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from the Russia investigation to pardoning the former Arizona sheriff, Joe Arpaio, Trump has treated the justice system and the Justice Department as his personal protection and vendetta machine.
   
 Early Tuesday, he did it again, weighing in on the impending criminal sentencing of Roger Stone, his longtime political adviser and fixer. A jury convicted Stone last year of obstructing justice, lying to Congress and threatening a witness with bodily harm. Federal prosecutors handling the case had sought a prison sentence of seven to nine years, which was within the sentencing guidelines range.
   
 But guidelines aren't for Trump. "This is a horrible and very unfair situation," the president said in a middle-of-the-night tweet.
   
 Hours later, top Justice Department officials overruled Stone's prosecutors, asking the court to sentence Stone to "far less" time, due to his "advanced age" (67) and to the fact that the witness he threatened said he did not take the threat seriously.
   
 Within hours, all four of Stone's prosecutors withdrew from the case; one resigned from the department.
   
 Trump was exultant. On Wednesday morning, he wrote, "Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought." He later said the prosecutors had treated Stone "very badly" and "ought to apologize" to him.
   
 This is alarming behavior, even by the debased standards of this president.
   
 A spokeswoman denied that the Justice Department was taking orders from the president in recommending the lower sentence, a claim Trump undermines every time he opens his mouth. On Tuesday, he announced that he has an "absolute right" to tell the Justice Department what to do.
   
 No, in fact, he does not. The Constitution compels the president, among other things, to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed." Since Trump has described that document as "like a foreign language," we'll take this opportunity to inform him that this clause does not give him the authority to run the Justice Department like a goon squad at one of his failed casinos.
   
 Republicans in Congress tried once again to rationalize the president's irrational behavior.
   
 An aspiring autocrat is only as powerful as his enablers, and Trump hit the jackpot in Barr, who is now taking control of all cases involving the president, including Stone's conviction.
   
 The departure of four respected prosecutors under these circumstances should worry all Americans. As Republicans in Congress abdicate their responsibility to act as a check on the executive and Trump packs the Justice Department with loyalists like Barr, the nonpolitical administration of justice depends all the more on career civil servants who have dedicated themselves to upholding the law and not to helping a president abuse his office.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife biologists have received notification from a genetics lab confirming that four scat samples collected near a scavenged elk carcass in Moffat County in early January came from wolves. This is the first official documentation of a pack of wolves in the state since the 1940s.
 Of the four samples, DNA results indicate three are female and one is male. The testing was also able to determine that all the wolves were related, likely as full siblings.
 “The DNA doesn’t tell us the age,” said CPW Species Conservation Program Manager Eric Odell. “We don’t know where or when they were born. We can’t say. But that there are closely related wolves is a pretty significant finding.”
 Odell also noted that “although previous reports had mentioned sightings of up to six wolves, this doesn’t do anything to alter that estimate. Just because we only collected four scat samples doesn’t mean there were only four animals.”
 CPW is still waiting to receive results back from scat samples collected at a potential wolf sighting in Moffat County on Jan. 19.
 CPW would like to remind the public that wolves are a federally endangered species and fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, killing a wolf can result in federal charges, including a $100,000 fine and a year in prison, per offense.
 The public is urged to contact CPW immediately if they see or hear wolves or find evidence of any wolf activity. The Wolf Sighting Form can be found on the CPW website, cpw.state.co.us.

Donald Trump the candidate said a lot of things in 2015 and 2016 that resonated with voters tired of politicians who seemed to have lost touch with those they were supposed to represent.
   
 "Drain the swamp" was a favorite -- Trump's shorthand for getting rid of self- serving Washington D.C. power brokers, or so supporters were supposed to believe.
   
 Another popular theme was attacking all things Obama, such as criticizing the term-limited president for taking time off to play golf or flying Air Force One to political events.
   
 "I would rarely leave the White House because there's so much work to be done. I would not be a president who took vacations," Trump was quoted by The Hill in a June 2015 interview.
   
 Countless contradictions to Trump's claims as a candidate and his behavior as president have been documented since then, with the latest being a Feb. 7 report by the Washington Post detailing at least part of the exorbitant fees taxpayers have been charged by Trump's resorts for putting up Secret Service agents while the president visits his clubs in Palm Beach, Florida, and Bedminster, New Jersey.
   
 The report documents room charges of $650 a night at Mar-a-Lago in 2017, while normal federal spending for a hotel room in the area was less than a third of that at $182. It cites a similarly excessive tab for a three-bedroom cottage at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, where the Secret Service was charged $17,000 a month in 2017, which The Post reported was "unusually high" for nearby properties.
   
 And the pricey visits are quite frequent. The Post found Trump has visited his private clubs and hotels more than 342 days -- a third of his presidency -- though he says he works on such visits.
   
 Especially galling in this latest swamp-drainage failure is that the 103 payments The Post found from the Secret Service to the Trump Organization are not a complete accounting but had to be gathered piecemeal in multiple public record requests by news and watchdog organizations. The Secret Service is supposed to report to Congress twice a year what it spends to protect the president but has filed only two of six required reports, and the two it did file did not disclose payments to Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster that should have been listed.
   
 Also repugnant is that Eric Trump, the president's son and family business executive vice president, has claimed wrongly that the Trump Organization is legally required to charge the Secret Service for the president's visits and said the company charges a minimal fee "like 50 bucks." The Secret Service stayed free when it had duty at George H.W. Bush's Maine compound, Bill Clinton's home in suburban New York and George W. Bush's Texas ranch.
   
 Earlier reports about Trump personally benefitting from visits by foreign officials seeking to do business with his administration were bad enough -- whether they stayed at Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. or he tried to boost business by pitching Trump National Doral Miami resort in Florida to host a G-7 summit of global leaders.
   
 And then there is his whining, as reported in a new book, that American companies are prohibited from bribing foreign officials to win business deals.
   
 Drain the swamp? It's more like Trump is dragging our rule of law into the swamp with him.

The top four teams in Spain qualify for the Champions League. Getafe's best ever finish is fifth, achieved last season under Bordalas
 Getafe rank joint 14th in terms of average shots per game in La Liga (10.6), 15th in average possession (43.1%) and bottom in terms of passing accuracy average (61.7%).
 But their real strength comes from being a tremendous unit who depend more on the collective than any one star. They have conceded just 20 goals all season. Only Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Athletic Bilbao have let in fewer.
 They play in their opponent's half more often than any other side, have the highest defensive line, play long more often than others, and also have the fifth best attack. They are more than a long-ball team.
 They are not, however, everyone's cup of sangria. Nobody has conceded more free-kicks (416) and no team has received more yellow cards (71). Quique Setien, who faces Bordalas this weekend in Barcelona, has been a particularly harsh critic going back to his time as coach of Lugo when Bordalas was at Alcorcon.
 "This isn't football," Setien said. "It's something else and it makes my blood boil."
 Bordalas is unapologetic about a style of play many feel runs contrary to the archetypal 'Spanish way'.
 "You must never forget that we are a humble side, a side not equipped to sit among the very best and that just two and a half years ago we were in the second division," he says.
 "We are a side that financially cannot compete with many teams and, as a result, I believe that things are going quite well here."
 The financial reality that affects clubs like Getafe on a regular basis is summed up by Leandro Cabrera leaving in January for bottom of the table Espanyol, who asked the Uruguayan defender what he was earning and, at a stroke, doubled it.
 Bordalas is learning English and, when asked if he can picture himself working in the Premier League in future, replies without hesititation: "Yes. It's something I have always had in mind and, as a professional, I would love it.
 "It would match well with my understanding of football and I am absolutely sure that I would enjoy it very much indeed."
 Bordalas is indeed a breath of fresh air. With Getafe or another team, it is safe to assume we have not heard the last of him - not by a long chalk.

The board exams are just round the corner and it brings with it tremendous stress both for the students and parents. Psychologist Shweta Khurana shares tips on coping with exam-related stress and maintaining good health before exams. Khurana states that in Psychology there is a saying that Eustress and distress kills . A little bit of anxiety can be good if it is kept under control as it can enhance the childs performance. A tip while prepping for exams is to divide the course syllabus into smaller parts for the day. Khurana says that when children think that there is too much to do they stress over it and worry that they will not be able to cover even a small bit, so dividing the course into smaller parts will help in the long run as the student realises that they have covered a major portion of the course over a period time. The feeling will give a lot of satisfaction and will build confidence. Another advice is to start doing the test papers between the time of 9.30 am and 1.30 pm, which is the usual time when the board exams are held. It will help in adjusting the body clock to that time and build a writing pattern and there will not be much difficulty on the first day of the exams. Long periods of study time without breaks can make students lethargic and stress them out. Khurana suggests to take a break, go to a nearby park or lie down on the bed for a little while. One mistake people make is that they start using their phone, but that is not a part of the break. Looking at the mobile screen will stimulate the brain further and make the brian tired. Therefore, it is better to go for a walk or do some relaxation exercises. Lying down or resting also gives some peace. Studying for long hours can make children, especially teenagers hungry. When children get bored they tend to eat things which are unhealthy. What happens is that unhealhty food makes you sluggish and tired. It makes people sleepy therefore the energy goes into a different zone. It is advisable to have a quick healthy bite, which also gives more energy to continue further with the studies. One more thing to keep in mind is to try to not be a night owl. When we sleep at night the brain restores all the information and keeps it in the memory which helps to retain all the information. So get the minimum eight hours of sleep. Get up early in the morning and study, she says.

It was supposed to be an educational meeting. It was supposed to preach the gospel of the Rocky Mountain Wolf Project to the unwashed masses of Montrose. The “masses” Monday of this week, were made up of 21 attendees, at least a quarter of whom were livestock producers. And then there was anti-wolf biologist and friend Glen Hinshaw, a CPW staffer, and me. The meeting was the best kept secret on the Western Slope.
 I found out about it after the meeting had already started when a friend who heard about it from a someone else called me. One familiar face belonged to sheepman Ernie Etchart, who told me that a friend from the Forest Service had called him, otherwise he would not have known.
 I wandered in over two hours late and during the second act of the show in which a young lady named Hillary was explaining to Western Slope ranchers (99.999% of whom were not there) how to manage their range land to avoid having their stock killed by wolves. Seriously.
 She was telling us how to manage for a sustainable ranch and to be proactive and not reactive in our management style. Most producers that I know, know that and do it. Then she seemed to suggest that ranchers need to rotate their grazing to avoid the wolves. At one point she explained that, yes, wolves kill livestock. And, she said, they (wolves) are very smart, they learn what habitat produces prey and they go there and kill it.
 That begs the question, why rotate away from them, if the predator is just going to learn again where the beef is.
 She told us wolves look for prey that is vulnerable or degraded – you know they are naturally thinning the herd or maybe it was picking “low hanging fruit.” That sounds good until the slide when she showed us about eight wolves who had just brought down a, royal, healthy bull elk. Another slide showed us a calf kill. But she didn’t mention that the rancher had just lost $600 worth of his herd.
 The message that I came away with was, we are going to put wolves in the mountains and you stock people need to adjust. If a cowman loses money because of the wolves, it is his fault because he didn’t manage his herd with the wolves in mind.
 The lecture lady also told us that having wolves would improve the rangeland — it was some sort of a rising ecology feeds all species kind of thing.
 Of course, the wolf project is one of dozens of organizations whose sole bent it to take cattle off public land and, in some cases, stop bovine production altogether. Impossible burgers for everyone, on the house.
 I have been told that if a stockman can’t manage the situation, he can always shut down. So let’s talk Ernie Etchart and the Etchart family. And, talk shut down, when they can’t handle the number of sheep being taken down by wolves. What do we lose? Ernie gave me the facts and numbers.
 The Etcharts have been running sheep in the Uncompahgre Valley and the San Juans since Basque sheepherder Martin Etchart came here from Europe in the late 1940s. They now husband something in excess of 4000 animals. Their summer range is permit land in the San Juans, exactly where the project wants to loose the wolves in a couple of years. During fall and spring, the sheep move to the middle ranges.
 Now, if that nice lady with the PowerPoint clicker was correct, the wolves will figure that out and the Etchart lambs are still in harm’s way.
 There are eight members of the family involved in running Etchart Livestock. They have children. There are about eight employees and their families. That group is an integral part of the Montrose area economic community. Shut down the income for that business and it ripples through the local economy. And no, that is not scare talk. Now, they are not as high profile as, say a Stovers, but you damage the business of 10 livestock producers and you have a Stovers.
 After listening to the morning presentations, Ernie told me that they sure as heck had not changed his mind.
 Why did they bother?
 The last date when the USDA would accept comments on its hemp regulations has come and gone. Turns out that there were about 4,600 comments sent to the USDA headquarters. Almost none were attaboys. Most were highly critical, to the point of raising some hackles of some of the desk jockeys who came up with the tripe they called hemp rules.
 The Colorado Legislature took the time to answer emasse:
 “Colorado continues to see tremendous growth in this industry and we are excited for the economic potential of this new crop,” the state’s congressional delegation wrote in a letter sent on Tuesday. “Therefore, it is critical the USDA establish a regulatory structure that allows our farmers to succeed.
 “While the [interim final rule} begins to formulate a much needed regulatory structure, there are key provisions that are unnecessary, burdensome, and could hurt Colorado’s hemp industry,” they said.
 Virtually every hemp growing state, hundreds of individual growers, and everybody else in the hemp production chain provided comment to the federal agency which has been given regulatory power over hemp farmers. As I have said before, the feds need not be involved. States like Colorado and a half dozen others are light years ahead of the bureaucracy. The GMO chemists are already producing hemp that has no THC, which would easily put hemp in the cornstalk category.
 GenCanna, a Kentucky firm, announced a year ago that they had already produced a non-THC hemp and the seeds are already on the market. With this leap, it makes no sense for the USDA to even begin to set up the bureaucracy and enforcement rules for hemp farming. Hemp is not now, nor will it ever be, a Schedule I Drug.
 It makes more sense for Colorado and other hemp-solid states to let the USDA know in no uncertain terms that “Up with your rules we will not put.”

Bisogna prima intendersi sul significato di ‘populista’: in politica tutto quanto è ‘populismo’ non foss’altro perché ogni partito, alle elezioni successive, deve farsi eleggere. Quindi l’elemento del ‘populismo’ è insito a tutti i partiti politici come dimostrano i conservatori inglesi che hanno comunque cavalcato la Brexit. Nel caso dell’AAP, il populismo è più proiettato verso una dimensione ‘liberal’ sia negli appelli sia nelle azioni politiche. Si candidano in pochi posti anche perché il loro messaggio, di fatto, non è poi così populista da avere un appeal globale indiano, tuttavia nell’Uttah Pradesh hanno candidato il primo transessuale della storia politica indiana. Ecco perché ‘populismo’ sì, ma un ‘populismo progressista’.

“Forgetting Sarah Marshall” is far and away the funniest breakup film of all time (apologies to Vince Vaughn’s “The Break-Up”). Kunis carries the film with endearing, sarcastic wit, and Bell supplies far more nuance than the usually vapid rom-com antagonist, which actually sets up the rare, compelling love triangle.
 But the film truly stands above because of its absolutely stacked supporting cast. Appearances by Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, and Bill Hader fill out the comedic lineup with a list of veritable A-listers that would go on to lead their own spectacular projects.
 So, in honor of St. Valentine, check out a film suited for love’s endings and its beginnings.

Si vous avez déjà voulu dîner à Gotham City sans craindre d’être attaqué par un clown non lavé et / ou M. Freeze, votre heure est venue. Londres se prépare à dévoiler un restaurant sur le thème de Batman qui regorge de plusieurs zones thématiques autour du Caped Crusader. Les chambres du restaurant seront conçues pour ressembler à la Batcave, à l'Iceberg Lounge du Pingouin, etc. Mais vous voudrez peut-être commencer à économiser des bat-bucks maintenant, car certains des prix des repas pourraient même faire rougir Bruce Wayne.
 Selon Forbes, Londres coupera le ruban sur un restaurant Batman ce printemps. Le joint s'appelle Park Row, qui est un autre nom pour Crime Alley, alias le lieu où les parents de Bruce Wayne ont été assassinés (je suppose qu'appeler un endroit pour manger "Crime Alley" n'a pas été dépassé les premières étapes de la planification). Le restaurant est situé à l'intérieur d'un «lieu de 18 000 pieds carrés qui se trouvera à l'intérieur du sous-sol d'un immeuble Art Déco en plein cœur de Londres» et espère offrir une «expérience qui ressemble plus à un dîner-spectacle qu'à un voyage dans un restaurant typique. "
 Vous entrez par une pièce conçue pour ressembler à la Batcave, et vous êtes alors confronté à "trois bars et cinq environnements de restauration très différents". Le prix sur chaque zone est différent, avec la moyenne du lowball autour de 58 $ (45 £) par personne. Un domaine est appelé Pennyworth, après le majordome de confiance de Batman. Il propose «des plats britanniques traditionnels dans une atmosphère de bibliothèque».
 Un autre encore est Old Gotham City, un «speakeasy méchant» servant des cocktails et des sushis dans une zone sur le thème de Harley Quinn. Il y a aussi le salon Iceberg, sur le thème du pingouin, et le Monarch Theatre, le quartier le plus cher, qui propose un «menu de dégustation à un prix moyen de 155 $ (120 £) par tête». Le Monarch Theatre, soit dit en passant, est le même théâtre que les Waynes fréquentaient juste avant d'être abattu, donc ce restaurant est vraiment all-in sur le truc "tuer les parents de Bruce Wayne". Peut-être qu'ils recréeront même les meurtres pour les invités - après tout, vous ne pouvez apparemment pas raconter une histoire de Batman sans un flash- back sur la disparition de ses parents.

America faces a worsening -- and largely untreated -- mental health crisis. One in five American adults lives with mental illness. And nearly 60% of those patients didn't receive any medical care for their condition in the past year.
   
 In Ohio alone, nearly 1.8 million adults suffer from a mental illness. Sadly, many of them struggle with drug abuse, alcohol dependence and suicidal thoughts.
   
 People go without care for several reasons, including a lack of nearby providers and a fear of social stigma. Fortunately, new "telehealth" technologies can overcome these hurdles. Doctors and insurers could help millions of suffering Americans by using these technologies to provide mental health care remotely.
   
 Our country doesn't have nearly enough mental health professionals to treat all the people who need their services. Almost 4 of 5 U.S. counties report a severe psychiatrist shortage, according to research from Merritt Hawkins. In the Buckeye State, more than 2.3 million residents live in federally designated mental health shortage areas. Just half of Ohio adults with a mental health issue received care for their condition between 2010 and 2014, according to a report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
   
 The figures for young Ohioans are worrying too. That same report found that nearly 60% of youth ages 12-17 who struggled with depression didn't receive care. The median wait time for an adolescent seeking a new appointment with a psychiatrist is 50 days, according to a study of more than 100 providers in the state.
   
 These gaps will grow in the coming years. By 2025, the United States will face a shortage of up to 15,600 psychiatrists, according to a report from the National Council for Behavioral Health.
   
 Telehealth can alleviate these coverage gaps by virtually connecting patients with specialists many miles away. That's important in Ohio, given that nearly 2.4 million people live in rural parts of the state.
   
 Consider how Carter Health Psychiatry and Wellness, a Texas-based clinic, uses telehealth to treat patients who may live hours away. It checks in on patients every day via text messaging or video conferencing to ensure they follow simple self-care routines, such as taking medication, sleeping, exercising and eating healthy.
   
 Carter's telehealth program has proved to be a resounding success. In an analysis of patients with depressive or anxiety disorders, up to 95% of patients complied with prescribed medication regimens, 90% used the platform three times a week to connect with their physician and 91% feel more engaged with providers.
   
 Telehealth also makes it easier for busy patients to see a doctor. Americans ranked difficulty scheduling appointments and lack of time third and fourth, respectively, in a survey explaining why they failed to visit a health provider. With telehealth, a doctor is on call around the clock. Many apps enable people to connect with a mental health professional 24/7.
   
 Equally important, telehealth enables people to dodge the social stigma of mental illness. Often, this stigma prevents people from seeking the treatment they need, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In North Carolina, for example, faculty at Wake Forest School of Medicine surveyed adults aged 60 and older in rural communities to see why they didn't seek treatment for mental health. The most common response was, "I should not need help."
   
 Telehealth offers a discreet, confidential way to receive care. No longer do people need to risk bumping into colleagues or neighbors at a psychiatrist's office; they can consult with a professional virtually.
   
 People are clamoring to use telehealth. Roughly three-quarters of patients age 18 to 44 are willing to receive care remotely, according to a survey from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Approximately 40% of Americans aged 18-34 would regularly use telehealth for behavioral health management, according to a survey from telehealth company American Well.
   
 Deploying telehealth widely could save lives -- in Ohio and nationwide. That's why it's crucial for health care providers, philanthropic organizations and even the government to fund telehealth initiatives and educate at-risk groups about their options. Meanwhile, insurers could expand coverage for telehealth options -- particularly for people who lack access to a brick-and-mortar provider.
   
 Telehealth can improve the lives of millions of Americans who suffer from mental illness. The faster we adopt it, the better off those patients will be.

Se una massa ripete lo stesso pensiero, il singolo è portato ad adeguare il proprio giudizio a quello generalista, anche se palesemente assurdo, assumendo la stessa posizione degli altri componenti. Il professor Asch formò un gruppo di 8 persone di cui 7 erano ‘complici’ e uno la cavia; a tutti furono mostrate sequenze di linee rette di diversa altezza, con misure nettamente differenziate. Fu chiesto a tutti i componenti quale fosse la linea più lunga e tutti indicarono quella che effettivamente era la maggiore. Dopo alcune prove ‘corrette’, i 7 complici iniziarono a indicare come maggiore una linea retta chiaramente più corta delle altre, il soggetto cavia era stata designato a rispondere all’ultimo o penultimo posto, e si conformò al resto del gruppo indicando anche lui la linea sbagliata.

New Alexandria Borough Council’s meeting Wednesday was light on voting, but not on drama.
 Two council members abruptly left the night’s meeting before it adjourned, with one verbally announcing his resignation as he headed for the door.
 The fireworks started after borough resident and former council president the Rev. Bryan Werner questioned council regarding projects within the borough made possible by the 1-mill property tax increase approved in November and how those projects are reflected in the borough’s 2020 budget, which was approved in December.
 Council president Tim Ruane said Main Street is set for resurfacing when weather permits after council in July awarded the project for a double layer of seal coating over the entire length of Main Street to Russell Standard for $60,060. The company was unable to complete the work during the 2019 paving season and is set to resurface the street this spring.
 Work on cleaning out storm drains throughout the borough is also planned for spring, Ruane said.
 “That’s normal maintenance,” Werner said. “So are you increasing the maintenance budget?”
 Councilman Henry Snyder said storm drain work isn’t specifically outlined in the spending plan.
 “The storm drains are something we knew we had problems, but we didn’t know we had the problems we’ve got,” Snyder said. “So that’s not in the budget. You don’t plan, you don’t budget for unforeseen stuff.”
 “It’s a $5,000 increase,” Snyder said of the added revenue generated by the tax increase.
 Councilwoman Jennifer Graham, who had served as council president prior to Ruane being elected to the position during council’s annual reorganization meeting in January, said the tax increase could bolster a fund balance that has been reduced as council worked to catch up on projects and maintenance that had been ignored over the years.
 “You have to understand that councils of the last few years have done a lot of doing truck maintenance that was never done, doing maintenance on storm drains and sewers that was not kept up on,” Graham said. “There’s been a lot that’s gone on that has depleted funds because routine maintenance, for years, was not done… If they were maintained, there were no maintenance records to be found. We dug high and low to see when the last time hydraulic lines were changed and brake lines were changed, things like that. They were unable to be found.”
 The talk of the budget and tax increase prompted new council vice president Beverly King to lobby for changes to the budget drafting process this year.
 Council discussed a tax increase publicly during its Sept. 11 meeting and voted to advertise the tax hike the following month.
 “It’s been quite a few years since the borough has raised taxes,” Graham said in September. “...We have depleted a lot of funds with the improvements that this council has done for the borough and put into the borough, so it’s time for us to start making a little bit more money so we can continue to improve things in the borough.”
 The 1-mill tax increase, which was formally approved at council’s Nov. 13 meeting, generates about $5,000 in additional tax revenue for the borough by raising the average property owner’s annual tax bill by $22.14.
 At the same Nov. 13 meeting, council unanimously approved advertising a 2020 budget with revenues and expenditures balanced at $126,853, an increase of $4,688 over the 2019 budget. Council granted final approval to the budget with no changes to the tentative spending plan during its December meeting.
 “You had a month and a half to look at the budget,” Snyder told King following her request for more meeting time this year devoted to crafting the 2021 budget. “You didn’t say one darn thing.”
 King said the budget should have been laid out and discussed during a meeting, “so we can talk about it; reading it doesn’t help.”
 “That’s it,” Snyder said as he left the table and walked out. “I quit. I resign. I cannot work with this lady… You’re backstabbing and you’re dishonest. I don’t want anything to do with you.”
 Council did not take action on Snyder’s resignation announcement Wednesday.
 After Snyder’s departure, Graham also left the meeting, accusing King of approaching borough employees after last month’s reorganization to “badmouth the former president.”
 “Henry’s right. We had a budget meeting, we got the budget in advance,” Graham added. “Everybody could talk about it at the prep sessions that happened a week before the meetings. Everything is open to the public. This act and this ridiculousness is an embarrassment and it is very unprofessional.”
 Councilman Herb Morrow, after Snyder and Graham left the meeting, disputed the claims that a budget meeting was held.
 “There was always a budget meeting a month or two before and we’d get together and sit down,” Morrow said of previous years. “I’ll be honest, I missed most of them because I knew you guys would do a wonderful job. That didn’t happen. It didn’t happen this time and it didn’t happen last time. I’m not saying that’s wrong, but if they’re saying there was a budget meeting, no, there in fact was not. There was this thing they’re calling a prep meeting, which we never really used to have.”
 “The budget was handed to us the week before the meeting,” King said.
 “Just like raising taxes,” King said after the meeting. “Those two (Snyder and Graham) knew about it and we didn’t know. We’ve got to work together.”
 Prior to the public comment period to close out the meeting, council only voted on two items of note, both related to the proposed trail and sanitary sewer project between Keystone State Park and New Alexandria Borough.
 Council approved amending a lease agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pertaining to borough property that is to be part of the project, and in a related item approved an agreement with Derry Township Municipal Authority (DTMA) for the same purpose. The items open the door for DTMA to perform work for the project, with the borough being released from any liability associated with the work.
 There were several items listed on the agenda that were tabled to allow for further review or additional information, including the potential attempt to sell a Steiner zero-turn lawn mower the borough no longer uses. Council also discussed collection of the per capita tax, two-thirds of which goes to Derry Area School District. No action was taken regarding the per capita tax, as council is awaiting additional review of the matter by the borough’s solicitor.
 Council also tabled action on approving a new emergency management director until members have had an opportunity to review the resumes and applications of two candidates, Andrew Kolano and Shawn Buzzard.

 The FIGC says it is "convinced that, by continuing the path already undertaken, football can be brought into a dimension ever closer to the millions of fans, without affecting the referee's authority but rather by providing him with concrete tools".
 It has informally put the idea to Fifa's rule-making body, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), and says it is ready to experiment with the use of challenges.

Im Unterschied zu etablierten CI/CD- Frameworks sei die Wind-River-Variante speziell auf die Anforderungen von Edge-Geräten mit ihren überdurchschnittlich langen Lebenszyklen und der Beschränkung auf möglichst kompakte Softwarepakete zugeschnitten. Neben der grundlegenden Unterstützung für Kubernetes, Docker & Co. ist die CD-Plattform auf getrennte asynchrone Updates von Containern und dem darunterliegenden Betriebssystem ausgelegt. Dadurch können Anwender auch verschiedene Applikationen, die jeweils in eigenen Containern auf Wind River Linux laufen, unabhängig vom Update oder eines Neustarts des Host-OS aktualisieren.
