There is a short story called Chhuti that Rabindranath Tagore had written in 1892, which captures the existential travails of adolescent boys in a heartbreaking manner. In it, the Bengali literary icon writes about how Phatik mdash the 14 year old protagonist mdash is caught in that awkward age when he is not a baby anymore that his childishness will be laughed away, and nor is he an adult yet whose opinions will be taken seriously. All he needs in this in between phase is to be loved, but his foster parents deny him that reassurance. The story ends in tragedy. But the inherent sadness that lies at its core emanates from society s unwillingness to empathise with adolescents like Phatik, leaving them starved of a sense of acceptance, and a gaping hole in their conscience. Around 50 years after Tagore penned Chhuti, Pakistani scholar Muhammad Hassan Ansari explored the same theme of conflict through an Urdu lens, with a story called Phislan. Except that Ansari explored another crisis that teenage boys face mdash coming to grips with hitherto unexplored feelings of sexuality. That story has now been adapted for the stage, with the group Afsana Theatre retaining its essential elements. Pre recorded versions of the physical play will be screened online this week, and director Jitender Singh tells us that the plot is set in the era of nawabs, in the early 20th century. The premise revolves around a teenager named Jameel, a nawab s son who is effeminate by nature. His friends thus poke regular fun at him, but Jameel doesn t resent that since he secretly enjoys the resultant attention he gets. Remember that this was a time when boys and girls weren t allowed to mingle. It was almost as if the elders built a brick wall between the two genders. So, though Ansari didn t say it outright, it s construable that the attention that Jameel enjoyed from his bullying peers came from an unfulfilled sexual desire that mdash given his post puberty age mdash the youngster had started craving. Matters then come to a head when a male domestic help his age joins the household. This character is called Nazru, and he is a playful youngster who is an absolute joy to be around. Jameel s friends thus start gravitating towards him, meaning he has to give up on his share of their attention. The teenager starts resenting Nazru as a consequence, till one day, he realises that this resentment is starting to turn into a feeling of love. Is this love sexual in nature It could be, but the plot leaves that bit open ended. It s up to the audience to gauge if there are indeed any homosexual overtones in the way Jameel feels. Jitender Singh The point is that adolescents mdash even to this day mdash find it incredibly difficult to explain the inner turmoil they feel because of the hormonal changes taking place within. Their physical appearances often start turning gangly or obese. Their voice develops a gruffness that s unpleasant to the ears. They are usually too shy to talk about any sexual desires, because an adult who will lend them an empathetic ear is as rare as a girl who s allowed into an all boys school. Singh says, The story is about the relationship between a newly assigned help and his teenage master, but it depicts the rawness of teenagers and their unexplored sexuality. This denial of desire sometimes leads to boys mdash and indeed girls as well mdash to explore each other s bodies. But does that necessarily mean that they are gay or lesbian Or is it that an indifferent society leaves them with no other avenue to find the answers they seek, possibly leaving them with an irreparable sense of guilt later in life That s the question that Phislan explores. It s an age old subject that Tagore laid the foundations for with Chhuti. But Ansari explored it a step further. And as people who can make a difference in the real world, we should also take a leaf out their books, trying to understand the existential travails of adolescent youngsters instead of brushing them off, be it a Phatik or a Jameel.

Since the distinction between objectivity and subjectivity – or between high and low art – is usually non-existent in Vodou, the _Primitif_ approach is as much in sync with this belief-system as it is with the workings of local crafts. Thus, _Primitif_ art, from any generation (much like the earliest insurrections propelled by mostly kidnapped West Africans as if without entrenched leadership or a standard play book, so to say, and that nevertheless in great part led to Haiti’s independence in 1804) has much to do with the can-do attitude of creators, both as individuals and as embodiments of an uncodified and embryonic social or collective mind. To a great extent this explains why _Primitif_ art often seems to exist as if unchanged by history.

Gov. Gavin Newsom publicly encouraged Uber, Lyft and labor to negotiate a compromise that could have created a unique classification allowing the companies to treat their workers as independent contractors and giving unions some ability to organize them, but that deal never materialized.
 As talks stalled, Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates turned to the ballot. The companies say that if the measure fails, drivers would lose the flexibility to determine their own schedules, customers could face higher prices, and service could be limited in some areas. Newsom, who signed AB 5, has remained neutral on Proposition 22.
 The California Legislative Analyst’s Office found that paying for standard benefits and protections makes up about 20% of total employee costs for companies, suggesting a significant increase in business costs if app-based companies must adhere to state law.

Clark County had 13,365 straight party Republican tickets, 8,312 straight party Democrat tickets and 257 straight party Libertarian tickets. Across the board, there were more Democrats who voted early and more Republicans who voted on Election Day.
 "I think it's pretty apparent that Republicans came out on droves," said Clark County GOP Party Chair Jamey Noel after results were released Tuesday. He also attributed the big wins to straight party tickets. Not long after polls closed, Indiana was called for the re-election of Republican President Donald Trump.
 "I think here in Clark County, there's a lot of energetic red-wave voters," Noel said. "Years ago it was a big swing vote in the other direction."
 He added that the overall turnout itself was not surprising, since "there's a lot of people engaged," he said. Noel added that he feels the Republican Party is well balanced by having locally elected two women and what he believes is the first Republican African-American candidate to be elected in Clark County with John Miller on the Clark County council.
 "I'm very excited about the diverse Republican Party and who we elected," he said, adding that "I know its no fun to lose races but hats off to everyone who ran."
 But Clark County Democratic Party Chair Kate Miller said the straight party tickets can be damaging to local candidates.
 "It's pretty discouraging," she said of the Election Day results. "It's really more than people putting their name up for a position...you spend your time, you put your heart and soul, and then you get knocked off by obvious straight party ticket.
 "It doesn't matter the quality of candidates on the down ballots."
 She also pointed out that some candidates have recently switched parties to run as Republicans.
 "We have folks who have no problem switching parties to have an 'R' behind their name in order to win a race," she said. "It creates a lot of races that are filled by opportunists. You miss out on folks who are giving to the community now and will continue to give to the community," outside of an elected office.

The Foyer insurgents’ and Merisier’s stated need to distinguish themselves from the practice of the _Primitif_ artists has more to do with an unstated wish to transmute mere art talent and energy – as, for instance, in Cédor’s case – into a more lasting form of power that could be (socio-economically) instrumentalized at will. Conceivably, it’s a wish for power that supersedes, analogously, the ostensibly improvised maneuvers of the (early) rank and file insurrectionists of the Haitian revolution so as to end up with, say, the more codified precepts in Jean-Jacques Dessalines’ 1805 constitution.

“That old flag to me represented a lot of rebelism, you know, the good old boys,” said Roberts, who is Black. “It never bothered me. ... But is time for a different flag so our new generation can see that all that is in the past, and they don’t have to deal with that. We were brought up to just live with it. But I’m glad that now it’s time for a change.”
 The public submitted nearly 3,000 flag designs. A nine-person commission — with members appointed by the governor, lieutenant governor and House speaker — chose the magnolia flag to go on the ballot.
 If voters had rejected the magnolia flag, the commission would have designed another flag that still could not include the Confederate symbol and must include “In God We Trust.” That design would have gone on the ballot in November 2021.
 Separately, supporters of the old Mississippi flag are starting an initiative that could revive the old flag by putting the Confederate-themed banner and some other designs up for a statewide vote. But they face big hurdles in gathering enough signatures to get their ideas on the ballot, and their efforts could be complicated by limited public interaction during the coronavirus pandemic.

It was clear for some time that the Hennepin County Board was in store for a new look following this year's election, and now, voters know how that makeover will take shape.
 The seven-member board will see three new faces after three incumbents chose not to seek another term; only one incumbent with a seat on the ballot, Debbie Goettel, sought to remain. Goettel handily defeated challenger Boni Njenga.
 With all 55 precincts reporting in District 1, Brooklyn Park Mayor Jeff Lunde took 51% of the vote to defeat De'Vonna Pittman by about 1,500 votes. Lunde will replace Mike Opat, who did not seek re-election after serving on the County Board for 28 years.
 District 1 covers Brooklyn Park, Brooklyn Center, Crystal, Robbinsdale, New Hope and Osseo.
 The race with the widest margin came in District 5. There, Goettel defeated Njenga by taking about 73% of the vote, with all 56 precincts reporting. District 5 represents Richfield, Bloomington and part of Eden Prairie.
 The race was far closer in District 6, where Chris LaTondresse received 53% of the vote to defeat Dario Anselmo, with all 76 precincts reporting.
 District 6 includes the western suburbs of Edina, Excelsior, Hopkins, Minnetonka and part of Eden Prairie.
 District 7 brought another close race, with Kevin Anderson topping Danny Nadeau 51% to 48%, with all 63 precincts reporting.
 In all, the three newcomers will be replacing 49 years of combined County Board experience.

Rachel Robichaud, 28, juggled busy shifts last spring at Whole Foods Market in Framingham with her class schedule.
 When she wasn't trying to enforce rapidly changing guidelines and control anxious crowds, Robichaud was settling into remote courses toward her liberal arts degree at Massachusetts Bay Community College. Some interactions with customers could get nasty, said Robichaud, and distance learning meant a lot more responsibility on her as a student.
 Performing the balancing act again in the fall felt too overwhelming, said Robichaud. The 28-year-old with a 4.0 GPA is opting to take this semester off, and return when she feels ready.
 "Working in a grocery store, you encounter emotional stress, people on edge every single day," said Robichaud, who is a customer service supervisor. "To enforce mask-wearing and social distancing for 8 hours a day and then go home and try to focus -- it takes a toll."
    Salve Regina has the fewest COVID-19 cases among R.I. colleges. Why?  
 Robichaud is far from alone. MassBay's enrollment of 3,751 undergraduate students for the fall semester represents a 7% dip compared with its 2019 numbers. Contributing to that drop are about 225 students who chose to not return.
 Meanwhile, Framingham State University, which has 3,467 undergraduate students this fall, saw a 10% decline, according to data released by the state Department of Higher Education.
 Overall, 160,430 undergraduate students are enrolled within the Massachusetts public higher education system this fall, compared to last fall when 172,568 students were enrolled. It's the largest single-year decrease in fall undergraduate, according to the department, since its data collection began. This fall's overall enrollment level is comparable to the level of early 2000s.

 Representatives from Dean College in Franklin did not respond to messages asking for enrollment figures. Enrollment numbers from Regis College in Weston were not received by press time. Both are private institutions.
 Usually, community colleges see a bump in enrollment during economic slowdowns, as people choose to return to school to learn a new skill. But a pandemic-triggered recession brings a host of new challenges for students, said MassBay President David Podell.
 For example, many community college students are parents, said Podell. With most districts in a hybrid or remote model, he said he believes that many did not return or enroll because they would have had to balance childcare with studies.
 "Their family lives have been disrupted," said Podell.
 In other cases, students may have lost their jobs or need to pick up more hours, said Podell, saying "we're competing with their basic needs."
 To try to make things easier, the college has made more courses asynchronous so students can participate at any time, though he noted that does not work for all subjects.
    UMass to bring more students back for spring semester; more virus testing planned  
 For Framingham State, President Javier Cevallos said students are likely missing the on-campus aspect.
 "Our students want to be on campus, they don't want to be in front of a computer," said Cevallos. "They want to have the campus experience, athletic events, and clubs ... We have a number of students who just postponed for one year or deferred their admissions. They're waiting to see what happens."
 Though Framingham State's enrollment has declined compared to 2019, Cevallos estimated the university's enrollment of undergraduate students is likely back its 2010 numbers. Then, the institution experienced a large increase of students.
 College and university officials worry the trend has the potential to disrupt the education plans for some students. Podell said he's concerned about the students "who stop, who may not come back."
    'There are universities and colleges in New England who won't survive this': Pandemic impacts rippling across higher education  
 A 2013 study by Florida State University professor Toby J. Park tracked 38,000 community college students as they navigated school in Texas. He found that 94% of them had at least one "period of non-enrollment."
 More than 20,000 eventually returned to school, and 30% of those went on to receive their bachelor's degree.
 But those who dropped out two or more times struggle to graduate, Park found. Fewer than 5% of those students earned a four-year degree.
 "The biggest concern is that students lose their momentum in college," said Podell.
 Podell also noted that usually there's a lag between a recession and when enrollment picks up. For example, when the 2008 recession hit, enrollment at MassBay began to creep up until its peak in 2011.
 Cevallos said the university will continue to reach out to students to learn what barriers they're facing and then determine how best to help.
 "A bachelor's degree is really a ticket to a more productive life" and better wages, said Cevallos.
    Framingham State campus police reported not wearing masks  
 Robichaud, the MassBay student taking a temporary break, said she has four courses left before finishing her degree.
 Initially, she felt discouraged, saying it felt like she "was giving up."
 "I had to remind myself that I'm just doing the best I can with what I have and remember not to overwhelm myself either. I do feel like I made the right decision. As much as I'd hoped that things would have lightened up at work, they haven't. In that way I feel like I made the right decision."
 "School will still be there. You're not a failure for taking some time off," said Robichaud.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — With a little more than half of precincts reporting, Illinois appears to be rejecting a graduated income tax.
 The measure had 1,533,253 no votes, or 52%, to 1,429,890 yes votes, or 48% with 54% of precincts reporting.
 The measure would switch from a flat tax to a graduated income tax that takes a larger percentage from wealthy residents.
 The switch would give Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker and lawmakers a roadmap to paying down the state's billions of dollars in debt.
 The question on the ballot would amend the Illinois Constitution, which requires that income be taxed at a flat rate. It's currently at 4.95% for individual payers. Pritzker campaigned on switching to a graduated rate, contending he could raise $3 billion extra a year while not imposing higher taxes on 97% of taxpayers. The federal government and 32 other states use a graduated structure.

BROCKTON -- Typically, when the last name Colombo is mentioned in Brockton circles, it's about the legendary Boxers football coach and others from the Italian family who were known for their exploits on the gridiron.
 But for Jack Colombo, sports was never his forte, instead applying his creative skills in the field of music.
 Jack Colombo, 61, recalled going to a physical education class in high school led by his father's cousin, Armond Colombo, the late, renowned Brockton High School coach whose football teams won nine Eastern Mass. Division 1 Super Bowl championships.
 "I went to gym and Armond used to say, 'Go to the Fine Arts Building,'" Jack Colombo said. "My claim to fame is I'm the only Colombo who existed with no athletic ability."

 Colombo, a full-time musician and lifelong Brocktonian, was named a KORG USA- endorsed artist this year, as the keyboard company recognizes him for a career of accomplishments, including performances with 140 different acts with top 50 hit songs.
 Colombo, as a multi-keyboard performer, pianist, arranger and producer, has played with award-winning groups like The Drifters, featuring Charlie Thomas, serving as the group's music director for 23 years. He's also played concerts around the country and arranged music for The Lettermen, Al Jardine of The Beach Boys, The O'Jays, Bowzer of Sha Na Na, Ben E. King, Mary Wilson of The Supremes, The Manhattan Transfer and many others.
 Colombo is joining a long list of KORG artists that is highlighted by legends of the music industry like Phil Collins and Herbie Hancock.
 "I'm in good company," said Colombo, speaking recently by phone. "I'm humbly happy about it. It's a godsend. The opportunity doesn't come along people's way a lot. The keyboards are difficult endorsements. The products are a lot of money. It's different than drumsticks or guitar sponsorships. Those are more easy to come by."
 Colombo is founder, co-owner and an instructor at the Southeast School of Music in Easton.
 And Colombo has directed oldies music specials for PBS, made music for television commercials, served as music director for a Boston City Hall Plaza concert series, directed ballet pop concern series, provided a soundtrack for a Pittsburgh Steelers pre-game show, orchestrated a private Super Bowl celebration for the New England Patriots, directed music for the Catholic Tri- Parishes of Brockton and led national artist shows for Caribbean and Alaskan cruise companies. He also worked for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as a musical director for three years. And he put together the The Drifters vocalists reunion in 2005 that aired on PBS.
 Colombo has shared his love of music with his daughter, Tori Colombo, a seventh grader at West Middle School, who has joined him on stage, including once with The Drifters playing percussion at just nine years old in 2017 at Stadium Theatre in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Jack Colombo said he started playing organ and piano at age 9, first playing professionally as a 16-year- old at local function halls and family parties, calling the rock organ his "first love."
 "It was really cool as a dad to see her on stage," Colombo said. "And it was really cool for them, too. She was the youngest person to ever perform with The Drifters. It was awesome."
 Colombo said his daughter also brought her percussion rig on stage to join him and Bowzer from Sha Na NA in front of an audience of 16,000 people at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut during an oldies rock concert in 2018.
 "I think it is crazy to have a dad that has played in front of thousands of people," Tori Colombo said, during a break from remote learning classes, congratulating her father on the Korg artist endorsement. "I'm really happy. He always works hard no matter what. I'm glad this happened for him. It's amazing how he gets recognized everywhere and how he's so talented on the piano. It really is a blessing to have a dad that amazing."
 Colombo said another cool moment in his career was when he was complimented by singer and songwriter Paul Simon, who was in the audience for a 60s music show headlined by The Drifters at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in New Jersey around five years ago or so.
 "I was in disbelief," said Colombo, adding that he would have been a lot more nervous performing had he known Simon was in the crowd. "He said, 'You know, I'm not a fan of four-piece groups, but you guys really pulled it off and it sounded amazing.' I thought that was an awesome compliment."
 When Colombo became a musical director for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002, it opened up a new world for him, as he began to work with great singers, musicians and nationally renowned bands who made so many top hit songs.
 "I played with like 18 groups the first time around who had top hits, including Mary Wilson, The Manhattan Transfer and Al Jardine," Colombo said. "That kind of opened up that whole world and got me really involved in that circuit. Then everything became wide open. The floodgates opened up."
