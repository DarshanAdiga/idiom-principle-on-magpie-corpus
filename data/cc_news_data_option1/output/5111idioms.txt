 ## What is _Tiny Pretty Things_ about?
 When a star student at the Archer School for ballet training falls off a rooftop four stories to her death, a spot in the prestigious school opens up. It's offered to Neveah, who says in the trailer "they said they didn't want me," but as her ballet teacher mysteriously puts it, "something changed their mind." That leads Neveah to Chicago, where the Archer School, which is the sister school for the famous professional dance company, City Works Ballet, is based.
 Instantly, she can tell that something isn't quite right. Students are on edge from the death of their contemporary, and some even think that one of their other classmates is to blame; they spread rumors that he pushed her off the roof. Add sidelong glances from students across the room, forbidden romance between dancers, choreography that has the ballerinas on the tippiest of their toes, and a soundtrack that will get your heart thumping, and _Tiny Pretty Things_ is sure to be a show that will be hard to pause after one episode. __

Masculinity is treated as a burden; becoming a sissy, on the other hand, is liberating.  In light of the skyrocketing suicide rates and mental health disorders among young adults in the U.S., this dichotomization of gender roles offering promised relief from the burdens of life may be one of the most effective appeals of the sissy hypno "movement."
