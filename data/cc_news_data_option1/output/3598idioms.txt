The pellets are fed into a heated metal extruder, and jets of hot air force the liquefied plastic through an array of extremely small holes, producing fine plastic fibers. As the fibers cool, they overlap and stick together, forming a dense mesh.

Netflix hasn't officially announced anything about season 4 of Free Rein that's quite worrying for used fans and viewers. So, however, given that the Netflix show is among the most popular and famous teen-drama web series and, we'd expect the streaming giant not to give it up so instantaneously. The series is still a significant following, and there is room for progress in the storyline.

India’s GDP growth for Q1FY021 showed a sharp contraction of 23.9 percent y-o-y, the result of the deep impact of COVID-19 across sectors, barring agriculture that remained a sole silver lining. The steep cut in Q1 GDP prompted economists and ratings agencies to further reduce the GDP growth estimates for the full year. In the past few days, the consensus estimates on India’s GDP growth has been downgraded to an average of negative 9-10 percent from the negative 6-6.5 percent earlier.
 Certainly, the headline numbers aren’t reassuring at all. However, it is also a matter of perspective.
 For an optimist, the estimate of 9-10 percent contraction in GDP for the full year on the back of a 23.9 percent decline in Q1 essentially means an implied contraction of 3-3.5 percent (roughly) for the remaining nine months of the year. It also means an improving trend in quarterly GDP growth data from Q2 to Q4 this fiscal with perhaps positive growth in Q4. Well, an improving trend from the nadir of economic activity would certainly sound positive in the backdrop of a liquidity-driven global rally in equities.

Ma la pioggia d'odio non si esaurisce qui. Già perché ogni accadimento sembra consono a stimolare accuse e diffamazioni che una certa sinistra, da anni oramai riversa contro il centrodestra, arricchendo di storie fatti di cronaca per seminare odio e fomentare lo scontro politico. E in questi ultimi giorni arrivando anche a utilizzare falsamente entrambi i due accusati dell'omicidio di Willy Monteiro Duarte a Colleferro, tutti e due con precedenti penali. A tal proposito il partito di Fratelli d'Italia ha dato mandato ai propri legali di procedere alla querela del sottosegretario piddino Alessia Morani per i ripetuti atti diffamatori ai danni del movimento e dei suoi iscritti. Tra le numerose falsità diffuse dal sottosegretario c'è la presunta candidatura nel comune di Fondi, in provincia di Latina, tra le file del partito della Meloni di un estremista candidato in altra lista e la diffusione di falsi profili Facebook di presunti simpatizzanti di Fratelli d'Italia inneggianti alla morte del giovane Willy Monteiro Duarte. «Risulta di estrema gravità che un membro del governo diffonda falsità e menzogne ai danni delle forze di opposizione, un atteggiamento che in qualsiasi democrazia avanzata porterebbe a un duro richiamo politico da parte del premier e dei vertici istituzionali. Purtroppo riporta la nota di Fdi - constatato l'assenza di qualsivoglia intervento istituzionale di richiamo, il movimento politico Fratelli d'Italia si trova costretto a tutelare la propria immagine in sede giudiziaria». Non si esclude che fino al giorno del silenzio elettorale i cittadini assisteranno a una escalation di calunnie e discrediti riprovevoli.
