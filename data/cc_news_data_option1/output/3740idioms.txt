I use quotation marks for "free speech" above because many such debates are not truly First Amendment or constitutional issues, however the rhetoric and discussion around them is often framed by a guaranteed right to free speech. While many believe freedom of speech is a natural right -- not one that can be given or taken away by a government -- confusion about what is and what is not protected by the constitution has produced a rise in free speech absolutism, or the ideology that speech of any kind -- hateful, derogatory, or even violence inciting -- should never be censored. Proponents use compelling language like "marketplace of ideas" to imply that only the "best" and "good" ideas will multiply and take root. Ignoring the obvious question -- "'good' and 'best' for whom?" -- any cursory look at your social media feeds will quickly show that often divisive, angry voices win out over calls for understanding and peace.

BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) ‚Äî Rookie of the year Crystal Dangerfield scored 15 of her 17 points in the second half and Minnesota beat Phoenix 80-79 to advance to the semifinals of the WNBA playoffs.
 Damiris Dantas led Minnesota with 22 points although she missed a pair of free throws with 6.1 seconds left giving Phoenix the chance to pull off another last-second postseason victory. With no timeouts left, the Mercury got the ball up the court bur Skylar Diggins-Smith‚Äôs shot was off the mark at the buzzer.
 Two nights earlier, Shey Peddy made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer in an 85-84 win over Washington in a first-round victory.
 The loss was the first in eight career single-elimination playoff games for Diana Taurasi, She had 28 points and nine assists to lead the Mercury.
 Fourth-seeded Minnesota had been eliminated in the first round of the playoffs the previous two seasons.
 ‚ÄúWhen you think about the odds of beating a Diana Taurasi team in single elimination games ‚Äî you can tell me what her record is ‚Äî we knew we had our work cut out for us,‚Äù said Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve, who earned the league‚Äôs coach of the year honors earlier in the day. ‚ÄúA lot of effort went into guarding her and she still had 28 points and nine assists. A lot of things need to go your way.‚Äù
 Dangerfield was a big reason why that streak ended. She scored seven points in a 10-3 run to give Minnesota the lead for good, 74-67. Taurasi converted consecutive four-point plays to get the Mercury within one before Odyssey Sims‚Äô basket made it 80-77 with 2:31 to go.
 Sims finished with 14 points and Rachel Banham 11 for fourth-seeded Minnesota, which will play No. 2 Seattle in a best-of-5 semifinal series that begins Sunday.
 Minnesota‚Äôs 6-foot-6 Sylvia Fowles, the league‚Äôs all-time leading rebounder and 2017 league MVP, was playing for the first time after aggravating a right calf injury on Aug. 13. She played 18 minutes, scoring six points with four rebounds.
 The Lynx made up a nine-point halftime deficit to head into the final period tied at 60-all.
 Brianna Turner added 13 points and 14 rebounds and Kia Vaughn 10 points for the fifth-seeded Mercury, who have been hampered by injuries and Brittney Griner leaving the bubble for personal reasons for most of the second half of the season..
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sport isn‚Äôt it. It‚Äôs great when you win and terrible when you lose,‚Äù Mercury coach Sandy Brondello said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disappointing, rather be looking forward to that next round in the semifinals. I‚Äôll be sad in a few days and plan for the future. We got a lot of great pieces and keep adding to it. Put ourselves in a better position to win a championship next year.‚Äù

West Virginia football looks to improve in the red zone


--DocBreak--
West Virginia wants to get better in the red zone ‚Äì on all fronts.
 Offensively, the Mountaineers were one of the worst teams in the nation in that department scoring only 25 times on the 34 attempts between the 20‚Äôs. That put the program at 118th nationally as West Virginia only was able to score 16 touchdowns on those 25 scores. A total of five of those touchdowns came against N.C. State.
 Those struggles aren‚Äôt lost on head coach Neal Brown either.
 ‚ÄúThe focus is making sure we score touchdowns. We have to do a better job of that,‚Äù Brown said.
 Those missed opportunities were a combination of turnovers and missed field goals, as the Mountaineers struggled to find consistency on the offensive side of the ball.
 Things weren‚Äôt much better on the defensive side either as the Mountaineers allowed 42 scores in a total of 47 trips, putting the program at 114th in red zone efficiency. Of those scores, the Mountaineers allowed 30 touchdowns and 12 field goals resulting in opponents scoring 89.36-percent of the time.
 That means almost 72-percent of those scores resulted in touchdowns bolstered by the fact that according to Brown the Mountaineers did not force a single deep red zone turnover.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to force more takeaways. We have to try to make them kick,‚Äù he said.
 The good news for West Virginia is that it's a new year and so far so good as the Mountaineers converted seven of their eight red zone attempts into touchdowns. The only misfire was a missed field goal. Still, the program can't leave points on the field.
 It was going to be one of the focuses of the spring before things were canceled with a priority on all three sides of the ball to become a better team in that department. It remained that way once fall camp resumed and the results are showing.
 If West Virginia is going to become more consistent in 2020, it‚Äôs going to have to get better where it matters the most and that is in the red zone. That isn‚Äôt lost on the coaches and is one of the primary goals of the club.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) ‚Äî Mikko Koivu‚Äôs extraordinary career with the Minnesota Wild is over.
 General manager Bill Guerin said Friday the team will not resign the 37-year- old Finn, whose contract is expiring.
 Koivu is the only full-time captain the club has had ‚Äî he was appointed in 2009 after the role was rotated monthly over the first nine years of the franchise. He is the all-time Wild leader in games, assists, points and several other categories,
 Koivu returned from reconstructive right knee surgery for a 15th season and had four goals and 17 assists in 55 games while playing mostly on the fourth line.
 ‚ÄúHis hard work, dedication and team-first mentality will be extremely difficult to replace in our lineup,‚Äô Guerin said. ‚ÄúOff the ice, Mikko‚Äôs impact in the State of Hockey was immeasurable as he went out of his way to make a positive impact on so many people in our community, including his charitable contributions to Children‚Äôs Minnesota.‚Äù
 Koivu was drafted sixth overall in 2001 and made his NHL debut on Nov. 11, 2005. He is the first player to play all 1,000 NHL games with Minnesota.
 Earlier this month, the Wild acquired center Nick Bjugstad from Pittsburgh for a conditional selection in the 2021 draft. The 28-year-old Bjugstad, who has 97 goals, 110 assists and 681 hits in 439 career NHL games, will be asked to fill the role of a checking center.
 Guerin followed that move by this week trading 35-year-old veteran Eric Staal to Buffalo after he spent the last four seasons with the Wild. Speaking with reporters Friday, Staal said the makeover caught him by surprise.
 ‚ÄúI just thought that the year would start and we‚Äôll see how the year goes and if they wanted to move on maybe it would be a deadline-type thing,‚Äù Staal said. ‚ÄúSo I guess that‚Äôs more along the lines of why it felt a little bit out of the blue.‚Äù
 Staal, who spent the first 12 years of his NHL career with Carolina, was asked about his move to Minnesota in 2016 and what he will cherish the most.
 ‚ÄúWell, I think coming here initially the first year it was shoveling off the pond behind my house and having an outdoor rink for my kids,‚Äù said Staal, who is Canadian. ‚ÄúAnd then obviously just on-ice was awesome with the types of teams that we had here and the guys that kind of let me be me and I fit in nice and obviously found success, went to a couple All-Star Games. A lot of milestones. There‚Äôs a lot of memories that I‚Äôll keep for a long time.
 ‚ÄúBut I think the biggest thing was just that excitement and that passion that maybe had faltered a little bit,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI got that back just shoveling the outdoor rink.‚Äù

 And then everything changed.
 On Sept. 3, the Pac-12 announced an agreement with diagnostic health care manufacturer Quidel Corporation to implement daily rapid-results COVID-19 testing for close-contact sports across all of its campuses.
 And this week, after the Big Ten unveiled a fall season starting Oct. 23, the Pac-12 quickly received permissions from public health authorities in California and Oregon to move forward with contact practices.
 Which is how we arrived at a meeting with the conference‚Äôs presidents and chancellors Friday, to discuss a possible resumption of the fall football season.
 ‚ÄúOur medical advisory committee is much more comfortable with us going forward and it looks like the hurdles have been cleared in terms of the public health authorities in the states of California and Oregon,‚Äù Scott said in an interview with "The Dan Patrick Show" before the meeting Friday morning. ‚ÄúSo things are looking a lot more promising.

It's been a long, hot, dry summer and that's been great for restaurants trying to get back on their feet following a nearly 3-month shutdown.
 Open for take-out or delivery only during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, restaurants were able to offer outdoor dining June 8, and could begin serving customers indoors (at limited capacity) June 22.
 Sunshine and fair weather made it perfect for al fresco dining on patios, in parking lots and even on the street at restaurants, some that had never previously offered outdoor dining.
 And that's where many diners wanted to be, preferring to wait for a table outside, to one immediately available in the dining room.
 But the weather is starting to turn. The days are shorter, the evenings chillier and for those who have eaten up a summer of fresh air dining, the prospect of eating outside when the temperatures fall, is far less appealing.
 And restaurant owners know it.
 "People want to dine outside, and people will cancel when the weather is not conducive," said Peter Troutman, co-owner of the Scargo Cafe in Dennis. "I expect when the weather changes, we will see a downturn in business."
 Janet Demetri, the owner of the Friendly Fisherman in North Eastham agrees. In the spring, people will put up with cold and clouds to dine outside in 50-degree weather, because it's comparably warmer than winter, she said. The same hardiness does not apply to late summer and fall.
 "September with 55 degrees, no one will sit outside," she said.
 To help extend the crucial outdoor dining season, Gov. Charlie Baker recently announced doubling to $10 million the Shared Streets and Spaces grant program, which made pivoting to patio and parking lot dinning possible for many businesses by improving sidewalks, curbs, streets and parking.
 To date the program has given out $7.7 million to fund 91 different projects in 78 cities and towns. Funds used for things like jersey barriers to block off patio space earlier in the summer, may now be used for erecting tents and putting in outdoor heaters and lights.
 "These grants can help businesses invest in items to help create more space and follow safety guidance during this pandemic," Baker said during a visit to Bistro 5 in Medford last week.   "We hope this eases the burden on restaurants and extends their season for outdoor dining as well."
 Will you continue dining out at restaurants heading into the fall and winter? Let us know by voting in our poll below.

QUINCY -- Joseph LaRaia, whose career in the city's politics spanned decades and served as mayor from 1976 to 1978, has died. He was 88.
 A Korean War veteran, LaRaia won a seat on the city council in 1959 while he was still a student at Boston College, one of three political newcomers in their 20s elected that year. He was elected mayor in 1975 after a recount overturned the election night result. He lost his bid for re-election, and was defeated three other times he sought the office.
 His tenure as mayor was controversial, marked by clashes with the city council and two of his appointees being found guilty of corruption charges. Among his accomplishments was the construction of the new section of city hall and the Ruth Gordon Amphitheater in Merrymount.
 LaRaia wrote a book that was published in 1979 "City Under the Influence," about a mayor of a city named Quarry which "bears amazing similarities to Quincy and its cast of political characters," the Ledger wrote at the time.

The United Way campaign is closing in on the $400,000 level of its campaign and has so far raised $385,000.
 "We have reached 20 per cent of the $1,900,000 Needs Target," said 2020 campaign chair Vicky Ducharme. "We are just into the first week of the campaign and, while we are behind last year's level, there are some encouraging signs."
 As a result of the direct mail program and the agricultural mailer focused on Sarnia-Lambton's farming community, Ducharme said several first-time donors have already contributed to the campaign, and many others have increased their contributions this year over last year.
 Ducharme said the Nova Chemicals retiree letters were mailed this week, and additional letters are scheduled for later in the month.
 Imperial Oil has started its fundraising, and dozens of Imperial employees made their contributions during the first few hours after receiving their digital pledge card through email.
 Imperial employees are also planning three grab-and-go lunches, with the first being next week, said Ducharme.
 Shell Canada employees just launched their annual campaign and held a socially distanced pancake breakfast for the first time to get their drive off to a good start.
 Nova Chemicals is likely to begin their fundraising in the coming days.
 Both Nova Chemicals and Shell Canada will match all employee and retiree donations again this year.
 Other employee campaigns that are running include Cabot Canada, INEOS Styrolution and CF Industries.
 Ducharme said the campaign got off to a quiet start as the annual Day of Caring, originally planned for Tuesday, was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "The volunteers during the Day of Caring made unbelievable impacts on the lives of seniors and people with disabilities in our community and, unfortunately, we are just not able to offer that this year," she said. "I know the office has received several calls from disappointed volunteers who look forward to the event to lend a hand every year."
 Ducharme also pointed out the Day of Caring was also a great way to show people where and how their United Way contributions are used in our community. The United Way looked forward to sharing the many photos following each event.
 Ducharme said some of the federal government employees in Sarnia-Lambton are also well into the planning stages of their campaigns, and she was hopeful they can match other year's successes.
 The United Way of Sarnia-Lambton funds 36 programs and services offered by 18 regularly funded agencies. In addition to those agencies, the United Way is currently also funding the Income Tax program at the Inn of the Good Shepherd and Bluewater Health Withdrawal Management Residential Facility in Sarnia.
 The United Way campaign will run until the end of the year, and all donations are eligible for a charitable tax credit.

A correction is in order to the letter to the editor from Dwight Hunter. He keeps referring to Nevada Senate districts, those senators and the Electoral College. The Senate District 19 that he refers to is the state Legislature Senate, NOT the Senate in Washington, D.C. The Electoral College has nothing to do with the state legislatures. We, and every other state, only have two senators in Congress and that's where the Electoral College comes into play. To use our state Senate as an example is apples to oranges.

 Strength in our lower bodies is not only good for us but is a necessity for everyday life. In addition to walking, we sit and stand, bend and squat, lean and lunge, and everything else in between. All of those motions require leg strength, and to attain that, variety is key.
 Our move today is a step back lunge. This exercise will be working your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes and calves. All you need is a smooth surface for lunging.
 To begin this exercise, start by standing tall with your feet placed about hip-width. Holding your chest up, and engaging your abdominals for added balance, step back with your right foot.
 Keeping the weight on the ball of your foot; proceed to sit into the extended leg by bending in that knee. Your front knee will be bending as well but be mindful to keep the positioning behind the front foot.
 Continue to bend and sit into this step back lunge as low as you are comfortable doing then proceed to push back up to your starting position. Stand tall, with both feet returned to level ground. Then repeat the same movement on the left side.
 Keeping your hands positioned just on your hips, shoot for at least eight to 10 lunges on each side for three sets each.
 If you need intensity, you can hold a set of hand weights in each hand. And if you need a little help with balance, you can hold a broomstick just in front of you.
 If you have issues with knee pain, you can keep the lunge shallow. Just be mindful to engage the muscles you are focusing on.
 This step back lunge is great added into any lower body routine, and is also a great move to help with balance and stability.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) ‚Äî Xavier Rhodes and Adam Thielen came to training camp together as rookies in 2013, one of them the Vikings‚Äô first-round draft pick from Florida State, the other an undrafted rookie from Minnesota State.
 Over the next seven years, the cornerback and the receiver followed similar scripts.
 They fought to win roster spots and survived a coaching change. They traded jabs in practice and challenged one another to improve. They graduated from being part-time starters to full-time starters and eventually celebrated Pro Bowl experiences together, too.
 Then in March, the Vikings let Rhodes leave in free agency, splitting up the longtime friends. On Sunday, at Lucas Oil Stadium, they‚Äôll be reunited when Minnesota visits Indianapolis.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably been a big part of who I am today because he‚Äôs challenged me, he‚Äôs pushed me, he‚Äôs made things very difficult on me,‚Äù Thielen said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what helps you become a better football player. When you have a challenge like that, you‚Äôre constantly having to perform your best and having to get better, so I give him a lot of credit for helping me become the player I am.‚Äù
 Rhodes understands the sentiment and feels the same way about many of those who will be standing on the opposite sideline Sunday.
 He‚Äôll see Vikings coach Mike Zimmer, who taught the three-time Pro Bowler how to use his hands properly. Rhodes will see safety Harrison Smith, who was kind enough to take him under his wing eight seasons ago. He‚Äôll also see the two young, starting cornerbacks he mentored ‚Äî Mike Hughes, the Vikings‚Äô first- round pick in 2018, and Holton Hill, who made the team that season as an undrafted rookie.
 Even though the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions shorten the conversations, limit the contact and create an unusual environment with attendance limited to 2,500 fans, Rhodes is embracing the opportunity to catch up with old pals and former coaches.
 ‚ÄúIt was a brotherhood when I was there, and it‚Äôs still a brotherhood to this day,‚Äù Rhodes said, pointing out he holds no grudge against the Vikings. ‚ÄúWhen I was practicing against those guys, we were competing each and every play so it‚Äôs going to be the same there on the field. But I‚Äôm going to be able to tackle them this time.‚Äù
 The Vikings still hold Rhodes in high regard, too.
 ‚ÄúI love Xavier. He‚Äôs a great kid, a good competitor,‚Äù Zimmer said. ‚ÄúWe had a lot of good times together. We worked really close for a number of years, I guess it was. I hope he has a good year and is staying safe and healthy.‚Äù
 The pleasantries don‚Äôt mean Minnesota won‚Äôt take some shots at Rhodes on Sunday, though.
 Despite making last year‚Äôs Pro Bowl as an alternate, by most accounts Rhodes had a subpar season. And while Colts coaches generally praised Rhodes‚Äô play last weekend, they also acknowledged he‚Äôd like a do-over on two plays ‚Äî the touchdown he gave up and a critical pass interference call.
 Yes, Rhodes understands it‚Äôs not personal.
 Besides he has a job to do too, and it may include providing some key intelligence to his new teammates and coaches about tendencies, personnel and preferences about his old team ‚Äî one the Colts only see every four years.
 It‚Äôs just business.
 And if Rhodes and Thielen get another chance to go head-to-head, well, it promises to be every bit as competitive as it was in practice all those years ‚Äî and a matchup worth watching.
 ‚ÄúHe knows me just like I know him, so it definitely creates another challenge because he knows what I like to do, how I like to run routes, how I do certain things, and vice versa,‚Äù Thielen said. ‚ÄúSo it creates a challenge, that‚Äôs for sure. But that‚Äôs just how this league works. You figure it out on the fly, and you go against who you got to go against.‚Äù

 # Former Notre Dame tackle and St. Joseph football star Olmstead announces transfer
 Greg Tufaro
 Bridgewater Courier News
 A month after entering the NCAA transfer portal, former University of Notre Dame offensive lineman John Olmstead has found a new home.
 Olmstead, who was an All-State tackle at St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, where he was among the nation‚Äôs most heavily recruited players, has committed to Lafayette College.
 The North Brunswick native, citing personal reasons that he ‚Äúwould prefer to keep private,‚Äù announced Aug. 19 on social media that he entered the transfer portal.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thankful to Coach (Brian) Kelly and for my experiences at Notre Dame,‚Äù Olmstead said in a phone interview with USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey on Friday.
 ‚ÄúHe gave me the chance to play at the highest level and get a great academic experience. I spent two years out there and it will always be part of my journey.‚Äù
 Olmstead‚Äôs journey now takes him roughly 90 minutes from home and reunites him with longtime friend and former high school teammate Brian Reilly, a sophomore linebacker who also graduated from St. Joseph two years ago.
 Olmstead, who stands 6-foot-5 and weighs 283 pounds, held 35 scholarship offers, the second most nationwide at the time of his commitment among uncommitted offensive linemen in the class of 2019, according to 247Sports.
 New Jersey‚Äôs top-ranked college prospect as a high school senior, Olmstead selected Notre Dame over finalists Michigan, Minnesota, Ole Miss and Rutgers.
 Some of the other schools that offered Olmstead include Arkansas, Arizona State, Florida, Florida State, LSU, Mississippi State, Nebraska, N.C. State, Missouri, Northwestern, Oklahoma, Oregon, Penn State, Wisconsin, Virginia Tech and UCLA.
 Of selecting a college in the Patriot League, whose member schools are often called the ‚ÄúLittle Ivies,‚Äù Olmstead said he will be afforded an outstanding education and the chance to be closer to his family.
 ‚ÄúI definitely wanted to be closer to home this time around and I was still looking for a great academic school,‚Äù Olmstead said. ‚ÄúI really fell in love with the coaches there, and the campus is beautiful. It just felt right there.
 ‚ÄúThe biggest thing for me is I‚Äôve got to be happy where I‚Äôm at and mentally focused, and I think being at Lafayette and going to the Patriot League will be the best for me academically and football-wise.‚Äù
 247Sports national recruiting analyst Brian Dohn said in a phone interview last month that Olmstead has size, length and plays with power and a tenacity that belies his off-field demeanor.
 ‚ÄúBefore you look at what he does on the field, you realize he is one of the greatest kids you will ever come across, and I think that‚Äôs important,‚Äù Dohn said. ‚ÄúHe has a great heart, and that‚Äôs a great starting point. So, he builds character into any program he will go to.
 ‚ÄúSeeing him play,‚Äù Dohn said, ‚ÄúI was able to really understand what a tough competitor he also is.‚Äù
 Olmstead did not see action as a true freshman last season for Norte Dame, which defeated Duke in its season-opener. He has his full NCAA eligibility remaining.
 An excellent student with an outstanding pedigree, Olmstead‚Äôs parents, Pat and John, played college basketball and football, respectively, while his four sisters all played college lacrosse, two at the Division I level.
 Olmstead was arguably the most coveted player from Middlesex County since East Brunswick quarterback Bryan Fortay signed with Miami in 1989, and was the most highly touted offensive lineman from Middlesex County since J.P. Stevens‚Äô Jeremy Zuttah (2003) and Piscataway‚Äôs Anthony Davis (2006) signed with Rutgers.
 Both went on to play in the NFL, which is where St. Joseph head coach Rich Hilliard said in 2018 he expects Olmstead will eventually land.
 ‚ÄúEvery coach that comes into this building that wants him to play for his university says that John will probably be in the NFL," Hilliard said two years ago. "They all have high hopes for him.‚Äù
 Prior to Olmstead‚Äôs arrival, St. Joseph was renowned as a national basketball power with the school‚Äôs big men on campus being future first-round NBA Draft picks Karl-Anthony Towns, Jay Williams, Andrew Bynum and Wade Baldwin.
 Olmstead helped put St. Joseph‚Äôs football program on the map. With him leading the way, the school compiled an 18-2 record over his junior and senior seasons and amassed more than 3,400 yards from scrimmage in his final campaign.
 Olmstead is enrolling at Lafayette for the spring semester and looks forward to reuniting with Reilly, who was one of the state‚Äôs best linebackers as a high school senior and who played in every Lafayette game last season as a true freshman.
 ‚ÄúHe and I are very close,‚Äù Olmstead said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been great friends all throughout St. Joe‚Äôs. It‚Äôs going to be an awesome experience to be with him again and to play the game we both love and be on the same team.‚Äù
 Alyssa Davis, director of communications at St. Joseph, said Olmstead remained grounded throughout the recruiting process.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs somebody who has the ability to take his academics and athletics seriously, yet at the same time can joke around and make light of certain situations,‚Äù Davis said in 2018.
 "John is the complete package. He‚Äôs a well-rounded individual with personality and very respectful, which is a credit to his family."

A hallmark of repressive regimes is their "secret" police, unaccountable to anyone but despots and operating out of sight and without accountability. The thousands of police officers who deserve our respect and admiration should not be tarnished by those who would act in violation of laws out of anger, disrespect or baser instincts.
