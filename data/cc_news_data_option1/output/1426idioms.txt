MADRID, 11 abr (Reuters) - El número de muertos por coronavirus en España se elevó el sábado a 16.353 desde los 15.843 del día anterior, lo que supone un incremento del 3,22%, según los últimos datos del Ministerio de Sanidad.


  Un total de 510 personas murieron a causa de la enfermedad en la última jornada, por debajo de las 605 notificadas el día anterior. El porcentaje de incremento siguió desacelerándose el sábado tras la ralentización del viernes con respecto al día anterior (+3,97%).


  Por su parte, el número total de casos registrados ascendió el sábado a 161.852, frente a los 157.022 del viernes, una cifra un 3,08% más alta, lo cual supone una tasa ligeramente por encima al incremento del 3% del viernes.


  La desaceleración es una señal alentadora para el país, que ha sufrido el tercer mayor número de víctimas por el virus después de Italia y Estados Unidos.


  A principios de abril, el número de muertes alcanzó los 950 en un día, desbordando al servicio nacional de salud y obligando a las autoridades regionales a establecer morgues temporales en pistas de hielo y en edificios públicos en desuso.


  Sin embargo, a medida que disminuye la tasa de nuevas infecciones y muertes, el gobierno ha empezado a contemplar la posibilidad de una retirada gradual de las medidas de confinamiento, que han mantenido a la mayoría de las personas encerradas en sus casas desde mediados de marzo.


  A partir del lunes, se permitirá a los trabajadores de sectores como la construcción y la industria volver a trabajar, pese a las restricciones de movimiento a través de las fronteras terrestres de España con Francia y Portugal que el gobierno extendió por dos semanas más.


  Las medidas de aislamiento han causado una interrupción en las tradicionales celebraciones de Semana Santa, obligando al clero y a los fieles a idear formas creativas de participación.


  En la ciudad de Villar del Arzobispo, cerca de Valencia, el cura Raúl García celebró una misa con fotografías de sus feligreses colocadas en los bancos, y los invitó a ver el servicio en línea desde su casa.


  "Es una forma de no estar solo en la iglesia y que la gente sienta que me está acompañando", dijo a Reuters Television.

A new study from Chinese scientists on 130 recovered COVID-19 patients is raising questions about the extent to which people develop immunity to the virus.
 The paper -- a pre-print that has not been peer-reviewed yet -- found that patients produced differing levels of antibodies . Having identifiable coronavirus antibodies in your bloodstream means you've probably built up immunity. But roughly 8% of the patients studied didn't develop any detectable antibodies at all.
 "What this will mean to herd immunity will require more data from other parts of the world," Huang Jinghe, the leader of the research team behind the report, said, according to the South China Morning Post.
 Interestingly, the levels of antibodies patients produced seemed to correlate with their ages: Middle-aged and elderly recovered patients had higher levels of antibodies. Nine of the 10 of the patients who did not develop detectable levels of coronavirus antibodies were 40 years old or younger.
 Finding out more about how antibodies to the virus work will have major implications for both vaccine development and the potential for herd immunity.

Jeffrey M. Matyas, 45, of Hazleton passed away peacefully early Thursday morning at his home, surrounded by his family.      Jeff was born in New York City, the son of Joan (Takach) Brugger and stepfather, Michael N. Brugger, Hazleton, and the late John M. Matyas, who passed away in 1989.      Jeff was a graduate of Bloomsburg University with a degree in business administration and was currently working in sales with BB&T; Bank.      He was a member of Holy Rosary Roman Catholic Church, Hazleton.      Jeff was a wonderful son, loving husband, dedicated father, the best brother, the kindest, most generous uncle and a genuine friend. He will be greatly missed by anyone who knew him.      Jeffrey battled esophageal cancer for the past 4½ years. They say God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers. A truer statement was never made.      He had a love of sports, especially watching his sons, Evan and Ryan, on the street hockey court, Little League field and football field. He also loved watching his daughter, Hannah, play basketball and softball.      Jeff was past president of the Hazleton Area Football League (Youth Football) and also the Hazleton Street Hockey League. He had a love of the outdoors, enjoying hunting and fishing and belonged to several clubs, including Big Buck Lodge, Heights Rod and Gun Club, and Paradise Hunting & Fishing Club.      Jeff loved to listen to music and entertain. Every sunny weekend in the summer you could find him grilling or using his smoker to host a crowd by the pool. He had a "heart of gold" and everyone was welcomed with open arms.      Preceding him in death, in addition to his father, were his paternal grandparents, George and Bernice Matyas, and his maternal grandparents, Steve and Sue Takach.      Surviving are his wife, the former Kristen Strack Matyas; his mother, Joan (Takach) Brugger; stepfather, Michael N. Brugger, Hazleton; four children, Evan Matyas, at home; Ryan Matyas, at home; Hannah Matyas, at home; and Mason Matyas, at home; one sister, Katie Britten, Bermuda; several aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews.      Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, private funeral services will be held at the convenience of the family.      Internment will be held in Calvary Cemetery, Drums.      Arrangements are under the direction of Frank J. Bonin Funeral Home Inc., 542 N. Wyoming St., Hazleton.

I’ll simply describe the _National Treasure_ as Disney’s answer to _Indiana Jones_ , this time set in the United States and starring Nicholas Cage. You can make your own judgments on how good this is. I personally love these movies (yes, they made more than one and they are both on Disney+). Cage plays Ben Gates, a historian who is told of a family legend dating back to the 1820s involvings the Freemasons, the Knights Templar and of course, some treasure. What’s the catch you may ask? The treasure map is on the back of the Declaration of Independence, one of the most protected documents in the United States. Not only is this a fun movie to watch, but I’d say that this is one of Nick Cage’s better performances.

During my many years of researching the subject of Henry Beston, I had the opportunity to meet several family members and friends of the "Outermost Householder." One who had particularly close ties to Beston was none other than Eastham's own George Rongner.


  "After meeting Henry Beston my life changed; he was a magnificent person and he talked so glowingly about nature and about history that I too became interested in that sort of thing," Rongner wrote in one of his many letters to me. "I think probably Henry Beston had more influence on my life as a youngster than any other single person."


  A veteran of 32 years with the U.S. Coast Guard, Rongner was a dear friend of Beston since Rongner was a child and Beston was staying at the Fo'castle on the beach of Eastham, the setting for Beston's book "The Outermost House."


  The two met in 1925, when Beston arrived at the Rongner home on Nauset Road in Eastham for dinner, a moment that Rongner said he was "captivated," and "enraptured with the way he spoke and with his vast experiences and knowledge."


  Rongner's father, Yngve, was a surfman with the Coast Guard at the Nauset station. Rongner, who died in 2010, often referred to Beston as his "quasi- uncle."


  Beston would tell the young Rongner of the exotic places he had visited and gave him his first lessons on birds, encouraged him to read and write, and how to identify constellations in the night sky. Whenever Beston left the beach (the writer actually stayed there on and off for a few years, not one consecutive year), he would get a ride to the train station and wave wildly from the car as he passed the Rongner house. Beston would always return with a book or two for his young friend.


  Beston's influence stuck with Rongner for the rest of his life. He authored a book, "Life Aboard a Coast Guard Lightship," and his Coast Guard uniform has been on display in the Lightship Room at the Coast Guard Heritage Museum in Barnstable.


  According to the book, "The Military of World Wars," Rongner enlisted in the Coast Guard in 1937, and was assigned to the USN American Legion, an attack transport, in 1941. That same year, he also participated in the initial landings at Guadalcanal.


  He later became a chief warrant officer, and was commanding officer of the Buzzards lightship and two buoy tenders. He was also commended for leading a boarding party aboard two Soviet vessels in 1965. He retired from the Coast Guard in 1970.


  He also recalled the reaction Beston, who served as an ambulance driver and naval correspondent in World War I, had to war: "He hated war with a vengeance, and the political world that caused such conflicts. 'Brutal. Destructive. Innocent women and children being killed.' He frowned as he uttered such descriptions."


  With everything that Rongner experienced, his last meeting with Beston in 1966, two years prior to the authors' passing, ranked as heart-wrenching as any. Rongner was in Maine and arranged to stop by Beston's "Chimney Farm" house in Nobleboro, but soon found that his hero was bound to a wheelchair. After a short visit and several long bear hugs from Beston, he said good-bye for the last time.


  As Rongner recalled, "My eyes become moist whenever my thoughts drift back to that final meeting with my hero."

Jackie Lynn is the fictional pseudonym (or is it the other way round …?) of singer/songwriter Haley Fohr who is also known for her indie folk project Circuit des Yeux. With this mature follow-up Jacqueline, Lynn returns with her continuing story narrated by Fohr and ably assisted by Bitchin Bajas crew Cooper Crain, Rob Frye and Dan Quinlivan.      ‘Lynn’s’ self-titled debut in 2016 a ‘fried cocaine country record’ told the story of the enigmatic ‘Jackie' and her ‘life’ to date which included a former existence as a ‘drug dispenser’ in Chicago. She ain’t no chemist, though. Ever since those illicit times she’s been on the run to the outside of everything. On this analogue-monologue-travelogue these new songs are her missives to the world.      This alter-ego has not yet landed. Jackie’s now committed to a a peripatetic existence, forever on the go and never on the slow (lest her past catches up) the lost highways are her only sanctuaries. Each track details nine days of ups, downs, trials and travails. Snapshots of place to place, town to town, a stranger in a strange land, a life on the margins sticks out like a sore thumb to prying eyes so discretion is paramount. Nature is her compass (as ordnance and moral), the ‘moon her incubator’ on the meditative stock-taking ‘Traveller’s code of conduct’.      Like Orville Peck, another masked sigh plains drifter with a chequered backstory, Lynn is a cipher, a filter for noirish escapades and western visions of frontier existentialism. Remembering who you were and who you are now is a constant dialectic, a daily battle to avoid becoming unstuck.      On ‘Casino Queen and ‘Odessa’ ‘Jackie’ sounds like a techno Tanita Tikaram shaking some action to Giorgio Moroder, administering deep guttural mysticisms from the dancefloor’s edge. The looping ‘Odessa’ in particular is a 9 minute robo-groove, C3P-Oh-yeah! It’s like being lost in the maze in The Shining. It’s snowing and Jack’s got his axe. Everywhere and nowhere to run.      There’s also a scent of Kraftwerk’s electretro-futurism (‘Control’ and its Morse Code like emissions) and Brian Eno’s ambientscapes (‘Lenexa’), Ricky Nelson’s alone-some pining and at times Annie Lennox’s Eurhythmically spoken stare-glare (the slo-mo space-disco funk of Diamond Glue’).      ‘Shugar Water’ lifts liberally from Sparks’s ‘Amateur Hour’ with her soaring intonation also evocative of Russel Mael’s orch-poptones.   The somnambulant moonlit traipse down ‘Dream St.’ features string-driven swing from Julie Pomerleau and enfant provocateur ‘Bobby Conn’.      Rumours of a concept album, regarding the life and times of retired English golfer Tony Jacklin are yet to be denied.      This is Jackie Lynn. Catch her while she’s still in sight.

SOLVANG, Calif. (KEYT/CNN) - What started off as a small token of gratitude evolved into more than 500 cases of wine donated to medical facilities along the California coast. It began with a request for one case of wine to thank front line COVID-19 medical workers at a local hospital."My son drew on every bottle of wine little hearts and put a couple of nice notes in there,” Michael Speakman of Westerly Wines said. From the request, a sweeping donation plan emerged. The Santa Barbara County wine community poured itself into the project without hesitation. “We had people dropping off wine left and right. Twenty cases, 10 cases, five cases, one case,” Speakman said. “It’s pretty remarkable, amazing how our wine community came together in such a fast way. And they’re just all excited and happy to help out.”In just three days, more than 500 cases of wine were donated. Even U-Haul joined the cause, donating vans to help transport the cases. The cases will be dropped off at medical facilities from Santa Barbara, California to San Diego. "They are giving it to the front line first responders, nurses, doctors and all the people that are on the front line of this virus,” Speakman said. Each bottle was personally handled and tagged with a message of thanks from the wine community. Winemakers at all levels were part of the shipment as local wine industry and close friends help pack the cases. Vintners also invited the recipients to come up when the crisis is over.Copyright 2020 KEYT via CNN. All rights reserved.

 What the country needs right now is a plan.
 Actually it needs lots of plans for how things are going to work if COVID-19 sticks around for months or more. What are we going to do with schools? With businesses? With elections?
 Many of our elected officials, especially on the federal level, seem incapable of anticipating what's ahead. They're more focused on finding someone to blame for all the awful news.
 We would be better served if they also looked ahead and planned for what's to come.
 That includes what we should do about elections.
 Many are proposing that states adopt vote-by-mail systems for upcoming elections.
 It's a good idea and should be pursued, but not as the only option.
 Expanding use of vote centers and advanced voting, for example, would help spread voting out, making it easier to comply with social distancing requirements and stay-at-home orders.
 Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab refused to implement a state law that would have given counties those tools. Although legislators approved the use of vote centers about a year ago, Schwab said he didn't have time to write the rules and ensure all counties were informed, trained and equipped.
 That's not a response that bodes well for Kansas in its current health crisis.
 Of course, all might be fine by the Aug. 4 primary. People might not be worried about a coronavirus that has killed thousands and for which there is no vaccine.
 Perhaps President Donald Trump was right when he advised Americans that COVID-19 would just \"disappear\" one day soon.
 But it might be wise to have a plan in case that doesn't happen, in case the experts are right that the coronavirus will be a threat at some level until we have a vaccine, which is probably about a year away.
 The plan for how to hold elections should be taking shape now, and it should be ready to go by July 1, giving officials time to educate voters about changes.
 Michael Smith, a political science professor at Emporia State University, has proposed going to voting by mail.
 Such states as Washington, Oregon, Utah and Colorado use mail systems, which involve mailing ballots automatically to registered voters. Many of those states also offer other options as well.
 Given the present situation, Kansas might also want to set up lots of advance voting centers over at least a three-week period. Some should be near or at senior residential areas to facilitate voting among older voters.
 Officials also need to figure out how to provide opportunities to vote for those whose housing situation is changing or will change because of job losses and other circumstances.
 The plan could be adjustable, depending on the level of threat. Kansas voters would have more or fewer options, depending on the health advisories in effect, with specific elected and health officials making that determination.
 The aim should be to ensure that every eligible citizen is able to vote safely and is encouraged to do so.
 No Kansan should accept lack of time as an excuse for failing to develop and execute a plan.
 Holding fair and secure elections is a vital function of government. Those unable to fulfill that basic job function should resign now.
 In times such as these, real leaders don't look for excuses or people to blame. They look for answers.

The type of PPE required depends on the level of risk.
 Guidelines recommend that anyone working within two metres of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection.
 Clinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection, including disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors.
 For example, that would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing.

The forecast for the cruise line industry is even worse, said David Yaffe- Bellany at _The New York Times_.

The biggest cruise lines might have "enough money to survive another six months," but they were left out of the $2 trillion economic stimulus package because they're incorporated outside the U.S. Nightmarishly, several cruise ships are stranded at sea — including one off the coast of Uruguay on which 60 percent of passengers are sick.

It is likely that a number of proposed hotels could take longer to open than originally planned and some may be cancelled altogether. It is more probable, in any case, that Madrid will see a faster recovery of its occupancy levels once the domestic corporate base returns, as Barcelona needs to wait longer for the full re-establishment of international travel routes after the pandemic in order to enjoy normal occupancy levels. An additional ‘unknown quantity’ this time around, however, is that some of the currently closed hotels in both cities may never reopen, either because of the bankruptcy of their owners or an alternative use being preferred. The time taken for closed hotels to reopen will also need to be factored into the recovery of each city’s hotel market and will serve to prolong the time this takes.

The numbers came "as a relief to China's economic managers" — and a promising sign for travel executives around the globe.

Yes, it’s grown children now saying to their parents, “Get back in that house!” It’s graduating seniors in high schools and colleges who could well have already seen many friends for the last time. For others, it’s the lost job and the endangered mortgage. In degree, it’s all of us.
 Already, however, we are learning things about ourselves. Some of those things are bad, some good. Not for a long time have Americans used the word “we” as much as we are using it now. “We the people” are now we the locked in and locked out, locked in our homes and locked out of our workplaces. But in it all we are being educated and somewhat united. Anyone who has lived life for, say, 20 years should understand how America works. In America you can chase your dream, but sometimes that dream is stymied and one has to wait, re-coup, and try again.
 Another positive is that we have seen once more the neighborliness of Americans, and not just from next-door neighbors. Individuals, families, service clubs and even corporations are all extending themselves to help meet the needs of others.
 We are also learning a great deal about learning. Just when, why and by whose counsel did we begin lining students up in rows of desks with the teacher standing authoritatively before them? It wasn’t done that way in the beginning (Socrates held a disdain for it) and it’s not done that way now in homeschooling. When Jefferson in 1779 proposed a public “two track education for the laboring and the learned,” and when in the 1830s Horace Mann promoted “age grading,” surely neither visionary wished for a school with hundreds of children or youths together in one place. Today, though, we crowd them together in “comprehensive” schools and then wonder where our child’s bad influences come from.
 If we didn’t know already, we’re learning that high tech is also low touch. Parents are reporting that their children and teens are yearning to see their teachers, not just their friends. Technology, a blessing and a curse, cannot give love or encouragement as well as a human being can. Could our current isolation be pointing us toward consideration of, say, three days at school and two days at home with distinct assignments for the home days? With so many parents doing online work at home anyhow, schools don’t really have to be the babysitters they used to be. Are we about to experience “back to the future” and to understand there is nothing new under the sun, particularly when it comes to our emotional needs?
 The bad thing, maybe the worst, about our isolation is its political and sociological implications, particularly our docile acceptance of the government’s actions. Why aren’t governors seeking the wisdom of the electorate, the will of the people, before they declare their closures? Why are we relying on arguably overeducated experts and their significantly overstated “models” instead of on simple arithmetic, namely the comparison of cases, recoveries, and deaths to population? Why haven’t governors sought more counsel from state legislators who represent the people, particularly since freedom of assembly and freedom of worship are now being affected?
 Regarding arithmetic, as of this writing Georgia has 10,189 cases of coronavirus, 369 deaths, and 10 million people. The United States has 434,861 cases, 14,814 deaths, and 330 million people. Sorrow and gravity? Yes. A need for the panic pushed on us? No. Given China mischief on one side and Trump- hate on the other, it’s no longer conspiratorial, crazy, or premature to feel like something is fishy.
 There is simply too little concern for the economy. The economy is not an abstraction. It’s people working, buying and selling, providing jobs, and paying for mortgages and food. Yet, instead of hearing from the practitioner/producers of our economy, we are obeying professors and social scientists who tell us to close our stores. Social science is not a science and neither is political science. Both are studies of socio-political ideas and practices, not of hard facts. But if you have a doctor’s degree we’ll take your word for just about anything.
 Our economy — that means livelihood — is crumbling. If we’re all about saving lives, we had better save people’s livelihoods and homes. Let’s not let social scientists determine what gives us meaning or what risks we should or should not take. We’ve behaved mighty well. Let’s unlock our stores. Europe is already doing so.
 Small business needs a ventilator that costs nothing: an open front door. It’s needed while there’s still something to ventilate.

According to information from the Census Bureau, about 64 million households across the nation will receive paper questionnaires in the mail within the next week.
 Households that have not yet responded either online at 2020census.gov, by phone at (844) 330-2020 or by returning their census forms by mail should receive the paper questionnaires between now and Tuesday, but they can still respond in either of the three ways, regardless. later
 Census Bureau director Dr. Steven Dillingham said the response is easy without having to meet a census taker face to face.
 "It’s something everyone can do while practicing social distancing at home," he said.
 The Census Bureau, meanwhile, is continuing to hire field personnel who will go door-to-door later this summer at homes that have not yet responded. Their work will remain on hold, however, until the pandemic restrictions are lifted.
 "We continue to hire," Susan L. Licate, media specialist, wrote in an email on Friday. "We want to ensure we are ready to go once we get the OK to resume."
 The field operations are postponed, but will resume once the bureau receives the approval with guidance from the CDC and the census bureau headquarters to proceed, she said, adding, "We are still encouraging folks to apply (for the census jobs)."
 Licate noted that the rate of pay for Lawrence County census workers is $16 per hour, plus mileage reimbursement and paid training.
 The census is important because data from it drives federal funding every year for the next 10 years, Licate explained. "That is funding that supports our hospitals, schools, and libraries, emergency services, and community programs such as WIC, Head Start, Meals on Wheels, SNAP, the National School Lunch program, free and reduced lunches, subsidized housing, public transportation, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Medicaid, to name a few."
 This 10-year count marks the 24th census, counting every resident in the United States under a mandate by Article I, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.
 Lawrence County Commissioner Loretta Spielvogel at recent meetings of the commissioners has encouraged county residents to participate in the census, emphasizing its importance in determining funding for various local programs in community.

In a development that would fast track manufacture of coveralls for frontline medical staff fighting the COVID-19, two Ordnance factories were on Saturday granted accreditation by the NABL for conducting "Test for Blood Penetration Resistance", an OFB official said here. The two units of the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) - Small Arms Factory (SAF), Kanpur, in Uttar Pradesh and the Heavy Vehicle Factory (HVF), Avadi, in Tamil Nadu, were granted accreditation by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration (NABL) for conducting the test as the test equipment manufactured by them met the required standards, OFB deputy director general Gagan Chaturvedi said.
 The equipment was developed by a number of ordnance factories of the OFB in a competitive mission mode in a record time of a fortnight, he said. The basic principle of the test is to expose the fabric, used as a raw material to manufacture coveralls, to 'synthetic blood' at different pressure levels for specified periods of time, Chaturvedi said.
 "The test is essentially required to facilitate bulk manufacture of coveralls by manufacturers all over the country in large numbers for health workers and first responders dealing with patients afflicted with the corona virus," he said. Chaturvedi said that till now, this test was available only with SITRA, Coimbatore in the entire country and testing of the fabric for manufacture of coveralls had emerged as a critical bottleneck specially during the nationwide lockdown and in the absence of logistics.
 With this development, a second test facility has been created in South India and the first such facility has been established in North India, the DDG said. "This will not only enable the OFB to ramp up production of coveralls in its own clothing factories, four of which are in Uttar Pradesh and one in Tamil Nadu, but will also enable other agencies engaged in the manufacture of coveralls to avail themselves of this crucial testing facility," Chaturvedi said.

“We’re getting them tremendous amounts of supplies,” he said of health care workers. “Incredible. It’s a beautiful thing to watch.” This was when Americans were watching something else entirely — doctors wearing garbage bags for makeshift protection.

  MASKS, GLOVES, GOWNS


  In hospitals, masks, gloves and other protective garb come with the territory. But doctors, nurses, flight attendants and other front-line workers have had to go begging for such basics, even before public health leaders flipped and recommended facial coverings for everyone outside the home.


  The mere scale of the pandemic stretched supplies even in better prepared countries. Yet the enduring shortages in the U.S. are not just from a lack of foresight, but also from hesitancy as the pandemic started to sicken and kill Americans.


  It was not until mid-March, when some hospitals were already treating thousands of infected patients without enough equipment and pleading for help, that the government placed bulk orders for N95 masks and other basic necessities of medical care for its stockpile, The Associated Press reported. Washington dithered on supplies for two months after global alarm bells rang about a coming pandemic in January.


  And the Strategic National Stockpile, it turns out, is not the supply fortress you might have thought from its formidable name.


  It maxed out days ago, before the pandemic's peak in the U.S., and never filled its purpose of plugging the most essential and immediate gaps in supplies, though it helped.

For investors in liquid and other short-term debt funds, the sudden, the interim fall in NAV of these funds about two weeks ago had caused anxiety.
 While the performance of the funds has stabilised since then, there are still concerns on whether excess funds or surplus can be parked in these debt funds for the short term.
 Returns in both debt and equity markets have been volatile over the past month owing to fund outflows. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pulling out of corporate bonds also had a spill-over effect on the money market and other short-term debt instruments. In liquid and other ultra-short term debt funds, the sudden fall in NAV was led by a spike in yields across money market and debt papers; the thin volumes traded only compounded the problem. While returns have stabilised since then, such gyrations and volatility in the coming months cannot be ruled out, in view of the turmoil caused by Covid-19.
 In normal situations, investorswilling to take the market risk, are advised to park a portion of their surplus in liquid funds to earn higher returns than what bank savings accounts offer.
 At the current juncture, however, there are other factors that need to be noted.
 One, cash in hand and excess surplus in easily accessible bank accounts are now the need of the hour. Amid the ongoing turmoil, it is imperative for people to set aside ample funds to meet exigencies.
 Hence, invest in liquid funds only after you have set aside enough funds for emergency purposes.
 Two, given that there could be knee-jerk movements in the yields of short- term debt papers, returns of your existing liquid funds could get impacted in a short time-frame. If you have a fairly longish view of over one year, don’t rush to redeem the money in these funds.
 Three, given the RBI’s recent moves — cut in repo/reverse repo rate and targeted long-term repo (TLTRO) — yields could soften, lowering returns from liquid funds. With the repo rate at 4.4 per cent and the reverse repo rate at 4 per cent, liquid fund returns could be sub-5 per cent in the medium term.

If you’re skeptical or curious about this pandemic, how is what you’re hearing from the official Texas sources supposed to be reassuring?
 The information Texans are working with is too damn thin.
 Where to start? Not enough tests have been completed, or taken, to really know who has or doesn’t have the disease, where the Texas hotspots are, or whether people who have died of respiratory problems had COVID-19. The relatively small number of test results also means we don’t know which people had the disease and recovered (and how many people have recovered) and whether the projections being made with that skimpy data are accurate enough to guide our public health decisions.
 It’s not enough to say that the testing is getting better, that we know more than we knew just a few days ago. What we still don’t know overshadows what we do know.
 We’re like pilots flying in clouds without instruments. We know a little bit, but not enough to make really solid decisions or to figure out what’s next. We’re learning as we go. As of Thursday, Texas was reporting 10,230 cases and 199 deaths, 1,439 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 106,134 tests conducted.
 Given the level of testing right now, it’s hard to know how many cases Texas really has. Because the best way to get tested for the new coronavirus is to show symptoms that a medical professional finds troublesome, it’s probably safe to say we’re not testing many people who are carrying the virus but don’t have symptoms.
 t’s easier — because it’s more obvious — to map the institutional cases. When someone in a nursing home or a state supported living center or a prison tests positive, testing everyone in that location is simple and smart. It’s simple to figure out that everyone in a given building or campus might have been exposed.
 Even that data isn’t always available. The state of Texas initially wasn’t sharing details about the data it has collected from nursing homes where COVID-19 cases have been found. But a few days after The Texas Tribune’s Edgar Walters and Carla Astudillo wrote about it, the state revealed 13% of nursing homes have at least one confirmed case.
 Tracking cases is harder to do out in the world, particularly without robust and widespread testing. Unconfined Texans, even with stay-at-home directives, might not be in close contact like the residents and staff of a nursing home, but they are hardly in isolation.
 Plenty of people have jobs that can’t be done from home. They have to go out into the world every day to earn their livings.
 Some are still worshipping in person with fellow congregants, an activity expressly allowed in the governor’s stay-home proclamation. That has proved to be an effective way to spread the disease.
 Lots of us are doing essential shopping for groceries and other provisions — excursions that put us back, in a limited way, into the very social streams we’re all trying to avoid.The list of things we don’t know is a long one. You would expect that with a new disease. But you might also expect the pubic officials trying to lead us through this to gather all of the information possible, the better to solve the riddles of this new virus ravaging the world, the country and the state.
 Dr. David Persse with the Houston Health Department has said the disease disproportionately affects African Americans, but that city hasn’t released a demographic breakdown of cases. And it’s impossible to know whether that’s true in Houston or elsewhere in the state because of gaps in the data collected by the state. Or whether it’s also true for Hispanics in Texas.
 At the beginning of the week, the Texas Department of State Health Services had compiled data on race and ethnicity for less than a quarter of the confirmed cases.
 If you don’t collect it, you can’t use it as you decide the best policy responses to the disease.
 Texas, like every state, is trying to flatten the curve. But when it comes to data about the disease, the state appears to be behind the curve.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan announced last month that the military was mobilizing up to 24,000 troops so it would be able to respond to COVID-19 as well as floods and forest fires that have become commonplace in the spring in recent years.
 Equipment is being gathered at key military bases such CFB Borden in Ontario, but the majority of troops have been ordered to self-isolate to ensure they are clean of COVID-19 — to preserve their own health and so they don't infect those they are tasked with helping.
 Warships have also been ordered to wait off each coast until called into action for the same reason: to ensure their crews remain clean of COVID-19. And while aircrew continue to transport equipment and supplies here and to missions overseas, only essential staff are working.
 The Forces is expected to largely play a support role when it comes to COVID-19. While that may include helping enforce quarantines, it is more likely to entail helping with transportation, building shelters and facilities, setting up communications and some medical support.
 "We have limited medical capabilities," said retired lieutenant-general Guy Thibault. "The capabilities we have in the Canadian Forces are designed for the Canadian Forces. They are not designed for providing significant augmentation to the medical services of the country."
 It remains unclear exactly how many troops will be pulled into the fight against COVID-19. Sajjan indicated last week that the level of support will be based on individual requests from provinces and territories for assistance.
 Where military commanders are expecting to need large numbers of troops is to deal with spring floods and wildfires. Such disasters have been increasing in size and scope, and COVID-19 makes dealing with them especially hard this year.
 Not only will communities be hard-pressed to respond while practising physical distancing, military insiders say senior commanders worry that once troops are committed to a certain mission, they could be unavailable for other tasks for a significant period of time.
 Retired lieutenant-general and former Liberal MP Andrew Leslie says the reality is that the current situation has many similarities to a traditional war — including the need for military commanders to account for a certain number of casualties that will affect a unit's future ability to conduct operations.
 "This is a war," Leslie said. "Don't kid yourself. This is a war. There's a silent, unseen enemy that's trying to kill us. And you have to think clearly, you have to organize yourself."

It proved his final game for the club and sadly, The Blues weren't able to reach their second FA Cup final as the game went into extra-time and Paul Power settled the result as he scored a free-kick to send his side to Wembley. By then, years of problems with Beattie's knees had taken their toll, ending his England career in 1977 and increasingly interfering with his club availability. After the fifth in a series of unsuccessful operations in 1981 Beattie was forced to call time with Ipswich at the end of the year.

 As one of the few perennial vegetables in Kansas, fresh asparagus is a treat best eaten fresh from the garden. As with peaches, strawberries and tomatoes, fresh asparagus has a flavor unlike what you can typically find in the grocery store.
 Asparagus crowns should be planted between March 15 and April 15 in Kansas. Planted in a trench, asparagus crowns should be planted about 8 inches deep and between 18-24 inches apart in the row. Only cover the crowns to a depth half that of the trench, allowing the plants to adjust. As the plant begins to grow, gradually re-add soil until the trench is full by the end of the first season.
 The first season after planting, avoid any harvest. In the second season, you can harvest for three to four weeks or until the spear size begins to drop off. Every year thereafter, the asparagus can be harvested for six to eight weeks. A well cared-for asparagus crown will last 15 years or more without replanting. Once harvest has ended, leaf the asparagus growth, called ferns, for the remainder of the season. This is how the plants create and store energy for next year's spears.
 For established asparagus beds, harvest often begins in April. These first spears always seem to take a long time to reach harvest size. Asparagus growth is temperature dependent, so if cooler weather lingers, growth is at a snail's pace. As spears get longer, they will grow faster, so it's important to regularly check your patch, especially in warmer weather.
 Harvesting asparagus can be achieved by snapping or cutting the spears with a sharp knife. Snapping is quick and easy. Simply bend the stalk near the base until it breaks. Snapped ends dry quickly, so refrigerate or use the spears soon after harvest. In the fridge, keep the ends in water as you would a cut flower. If you cut asparagus, use a sharp knife to detach the spears slightly below ground level. This base is woodier than snapped asparagus, so it doesn't lose water as quickly. These woody ends are tough, so make sure to cut them off before cooking.
 The best time to control weeds in asparagus is early spring before the asparagus emerges. A light tilling (or hoeing) that is shallow enough to avoid the crowns eliminates existing weeds. This is also a good time to mix in organic matter and fertilizer. Fertilize according to a soil test or add 1 to 2 pounds of a 10-20-10 fertilizer per 20 feet of row before growth starts. If a soil test shows that only nitrogen is needed, apply 1 pound of a 16-0-0 product or ½ pound of a 30-4-5, 27-3-3 or similar fertilizer per 20 feet of row. Fertilize again at the same rate after the last harvest.
 For chemical weed control, herbicides can be used, but only before the asparagus emerges. Glyphosate (Roundup, Killzall) will kill weeds that are actively growing, and the preemergence herbicide trifluralin can be used to kill weed seeds as they germinate. Trifluralin is found in several products, but not all of them list asparagus on the label. Those that do have asparagus on the label include Miracle-Gro Weed Preventer Granules and Monterey Vegetable and Ornamental Weeder. Mulch, as with all our plants, is an excellent barrier to control weeds.
 During the harvest period, no herbicides can be used, although the end of harvest presents another weed control opportunity. Remove all ferns and spears and apply Roundup to control virtually all of the weeds present. After the application, allow ferns to regrow for the remainder of the season.
 Past the harvest season and after regrowth of the asparagus, weed control options are limited. Products that contain sethoxydim can be applied to asparagus to kill grassy weeds. Sethoxydim has no effect on broadleaves, so it will not affect asparagus. Two sethoxydim products available to homeowners and labeled for asparagus are Monterey Grass Getter and Hi-Yield Grass Killer. For broadleaves weed control at this time, the only option is to pull them and look forward to next year.
 Asparagus is, generally, the first fresh vegetable to be harvested in the spring, which makes it a welcome addition to the garden. For more information on asparagus, including major pests and diseases, visit our website, www.shawnee.k-state.edu.

As CBD markets continue to expand, farmers, researchers and businesses are looking at other industrial hemp plants -- cannabinoids.
   
 Last year, during their first year of production, 90% of Kansas' more than 200 industrial hemp farmers grew CBD hemp. The other 10% focused on grain and fiber varieties. By trying to grow CBD, these farmers were opting for a higher-yield hemp crop.
   
 "Hemp has hundreds of other cannabinoids," said Andrea Holmes, biochemistry professor at Doane University in Nebraska. "CBN, CBG, CBC, CBT, CBL, THCV, all of these are non-psychotropic, minor and rare cannabinoids. Every other week someone is isolating a new substance."
   
 CBDA, once processed, becomes CBD, a well-known major cannabinoid. This non- hallucinogenic hemp substance was part of numerous clinical trials that showed health benefits.
   
 Research is starting on minor cannabinoids, including CBN and CBG. Kansas farmers, processors and retailers are looking into these two hemp plants.
   
 Sheldon Coleman, co-owner of Sunnyland Kansas, is excited about CBG and CBN. This father/son operation grows the plants in Butler County and dries them in McPherson. Last year, they successfully grew and harvested CBD hemp. This year, they are looking into growing both CBN and CBG.
   
 CBN
   
 CBN - cannabinol -- is noted for its calming effects.
   
 According to Holmes, CBN has been shown to help with sleep disorders. She said it is usually mixed with CBD.
   
 CBD American Shaman, a Kansas City based company, which has 400 retail stores nationwide and more than 40 in Kansas, introduced CBNight in March. This water-soluble tincture is the first American Shaman item to focus on CBN and can be found in their Garden City, Hays, Hutchinson and Topeka stores.
   
 CBG
   
 "The new thing is CBG. It's bigger than CBD," Coleman said. "With CBG, you're getting twice the yield for the same weight. CBG has very little THC. One of the big deals is that it doesn't grow hot (meaning it does not surpass the less than 0.3% THC legal level)."
   
 Holmes said CBG - cannabigerol -- has shown on trial research anti- inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. Cosmetic companies are interested because this product may help with acne and sunburns.
   
 American Shaman already sells a CBG flower product. By summer, the company plans to release a new CBG product.
   
 "More is known of CBG," said Joel Mackey, a spokesman for CBD American Shaman. "It's kind of like your morning coffee."
   
 Along with buying from other producers, American Shaman partners with two hemp farms in Alma.
   
 "The market is opening up," said Jason Griffin, the director of Kansas State University's John C. Pair Horticulture Center and an ornamental tree and shrub specialist. But, he warned, farmers need to do their research on what they should plant.
   
 "A little bit of homework is prudent to consider what is best for you," he said. "CBD is not the only player in the game anymore."
   
 Griffin is hoping to plant CBG along with CBD plants on his test plots.
   
 Learning how to grow and market
   
 Holmes teaches several hemp classes at Doane University. She not only holds a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but has studied all forms of the hemp plant extensively. Her courses examine seed genetics, cultivation, processing and compliance.
   
 Sunnyland Kansas and America's Hemp Academy in De Soto teach producers about the cultivation, farming and harvesting techniques of industrial hemp.
   
 "We teach on grain fiber and floral variety from seed to sale," said Shelli Hornberger, the director of operations at America's Hemp Academy. "That would include CBD and CBG and all other cannabinoids.
   
 Time will tell
   
 "The CBD market got so completely flooded last year," said Erica Stark, the executive director of the National Hemp Association in Washington, D.C. "It remains to be seen how long that market (CBG) will hold or if those markets will get flooded."
   
 As for CBL and CBT, Stark said, we're only just beginning to touch the surface on what the benefits are.
   
 "It's a treasure trove," Holmes said. "But we will find out what these gems will do."

Easter, which is Sunday, April 12, and spring holidays are a traditional time of family gatherings, celebrations and observances. Like many other events and activities, Page County Public Health advises residents that these observances should be different this year.
 “We know many families gather together over Easter and Passover,” said Page County Public Health Director Jessica Erdman. “But, like school, shopping and most other activities, we’re asking residents to modify their plans in light of COVID-19.”
 Gatherings of family and friends, whether in Page County, or by travel to other states, is discouraged. When people come together, the chances of spreading the COVID-19 virus grow. Although people with symptoms of the virus (coughing, fever and shortness of breath) obviously should not be around other people, even those who are seemingly well should do the same.
 “We are learning that some people with coronavirus don’t have any symptoms, and that even those who later develop symptoms can pass the virus to others before showing symptoms. This is why even people who do not feel ill should stay home,” said Erdman.

Jeffrey M. Matyas, 45, of Hazleton passed away peacefully early Thursday morning at his home, surrounded by his family. Jeff was born in New York City, the son of Joan (Takach) Brugger and stepfather, Michael N. Brugger, Hazleton, and the late John M. Matyas, who passed away in 1989. Jeff was a graduate of Bloomsburg University with a degree in business administration and was currently working in sales with BB&T; Bank. He was a member of Holy Rosary Roman Catholic Church, Hazleton. Jeff was a wonderful son, loving husband, dedicated father, the best brother, the kindest, most generous uncle and a genuine friend. He will be greatly missed by anyone who knew him. Jeffrey battled esophageal cancer for the past 4½ years. They say God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers. A truer statement was never made. He had a love of sports, especially watching his sons, Evan and Ryan, on the street hockey court, Little League field and football field. He also loved watching his daughter, Hannah, play basketball and softball. Jeff was past president of the Hazleton Area Football League (Youth Football) and also the Hazleton Street Hockey League. He had a love of the outdoors, enjoying hunting and fishing and belonged to several clubs, including Big Buck Lodge, Heights Rod and Gun Club, and Paradise Hunting & Fishing Club. Jeff loved to listen to music and entertain. Every sunny weekend in the summer you could find him grilling or using his smoker to host a crowd by the pool. He had a heart of gold and everyone was welcomed with open arms. Preceding him in death, in addition to his father, were his paternal grandparents, George and Bernice Matyas, and his maternal grandparents, Steve and Sue Takach. Surviving are his wife, the former Kristen Strack Matyas; his mother, Joan (Takach) Brugger; stepfather, Michael N. Brugger, Hazleton; four children, Evan Matyas, at home; Ryan Matyas, at home; Hannah Matyas, at home; and Mason Matyas, at home; one sister, Katie Britten, Bermuda; several aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews. Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, private funeral services will be held at the convenience of the family. Internment will be held in Calvary Cemetery, Drums. Arrangements are under the direction of Frank J. Bonin Funeral Home Inc., 542 N. Wyoming St., Hazleton.

When it comes to deciding who the best third baseman is in Texas Rangers history, there are once again several names that stand come to my mind.


  The first is Michael Young. and Hank Blalock was fun to watch. Then there are guys like Steve Buechele and Dean Palmer.


  Don’t worry, Young’s time will come. How can it not since he is the all-time hits leader in franchise history?


  However, Adrian Beltre left a major mark at third base and, in my opinion, is the best to have ever played the position for the Rangers, and one of the best to play the position for any team.


  When he retired in 2018, he was ranked in the top 10 for third basemen for games played, assists, putouts as well as double plays. He’s the record holder for most hits, most runs and most RBIs by a player at his position.


  I’ll never forget watching history as Beltre chased his 3,000th hit, and when he accomplished it, it made me as a fan feel like I accomplished something as well.


  His retirement press conference was unlike any I’ve ever seen. It was humorous and upbeat, not emotional like they usually tend to be.


  I have no doubt that Beltre will one day find his way to Cooperstown. He finished his career with a batting average of .286, 3,166 hits, 1,524 runs, 1,707 RBIs and 211 stolen bases.


  He’s also a five-time Gold Glove winner and also won the Silver Slugger Award four times.


  As a Ranger, he had a batting average of .304 with 1,277 hits, 612 runs, and 699 RBIs.


  Beltre played the last eight years of his career in a Texas Rangers uniform. Before coming to Texas, there were rumors that he was a bad teammate but that couldn’t have been further from the truth.


  It was always fun to watch him and Elvis Andrus race for popups and ground balls. It always made me laugh too when Andrus removed Beltre’s hat to touch the third baseman’s head.


  He was just flat-out entertaining.


  I can still see that swing as he goes down on one knee.


  I hate the fact that for his sake, he never had the opportunity to hoist the Commissioner’s Trophy. Of course, it would have been especially sweet if he had done just that in a Texas Rangers uniform.


  One thing is for sure in my mind – Beltre is a true Hall of Famer, on and off the field.

Today, the Marietta Daily Journal begins a new publishing schedule. While this is Saturday, you are looking at the Sunday edition, too. It is now called the Weekend Edition, which looks pretty much like the Sunday edition to me. After that, the product will come to you on a five-day-per-week schedule, Tuesday through Saturday. The world is not coming to an end. A bunch of smart people are adapting to a changing business environment.
 While I didn’t have an oar in the water on the decision, I can tell you what is not going to change. Whether you read the MDJ in its traditional print format or online, this will still be the place to go for in-depth news about what is happening in Cobb County that you can’t get anywhere else.
 For example, the MDJ has done a tremendous job in keeping us up-to-the-minute on the personal impact the coronavirus is having on our lives and those of our neighbors, as well as what businesses are opened or closed, the various restrictions in place and the innate kindnesses that we are showing to one another.
 I will put the MDJ’s sports pages up against anyone. I’m not alone in that assessment. The Associated Press Sports Editors recently cited MDJ sports editor John Bednarowski as one of the national winners for best column writing in the country.
 Bednarowski has scored a coup with his Senior Night series featuring Cobb County high school student-athletes who have lost their chance to finish out their season this spring due to the cancellation of school — and sports — because of the pandemic. Most are headed off to college where some will continue their athletic careers, but many will not. Bednarowski’s series hopefully has helped ease the disappointment for these young people who will miss a last opportunity to compete in a sport they love on behalf of their school.
 So, what else hasn’t changed? You are looking at him. (Pause for applause and groans.) With permission from the editors, I will continue to amaze you with my linguistic legerdemain and in the spirit of 20th-century journalist, satirist, and social critic H.L. Mencken, I will seek to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable.
 I will also remain unpredictable. Humor-impaired wingnuts on both ends of the political spectrum are fair game. I will gleefully take equal aim at pettish pagans who proclaim there is no God (Boy, do they have a surprise awaiting them!) and gun-toting Bible-thumpers who think women are qualified to do anything in this world but preach in their pulpit.
 And before you ask: Yes, I will still be in touch with Jack and Jill, the two mules kicked out of Cobb County a few years ago and banished to Montana or Canada. I get those two places mixed up. It galls me to admit that when I speak to various groups across the county and give them the benefit of my unique perspective on world events, the first thing that usually comes up in the question-and-answer session is not further edification of the economic health of Kazakhstan but a request for an update on the two mules. Sometimes, I could just cry.
 Jack is still angry with not only being unceremoniously banished from Cobb County but being referred to by the county’s PR guy as “fictional.” I agree with Jack on that one. I know the two mules are real. I’m just not sure about the county’s PR guy. He’s been on the job for more than two years and I’ve never seen him. I did see a potted plant in Chairman Mike Boyce’s office once. It could have been the PR guy.
 I will remain a hawk in support of public education and the hard-working souls who labor in the classroom. I find it incongruous that so many of Cobb County’s Republican legislators as well as those in Cherokee County give our local school systems the back of their hand with private school voucher schemes. If there was ever a time not to be sucking money out of the state budget, it is now. Will that stop them? Not likely. Only the voters can do that.
 If that wasn’t bad enough, there are the self-absorbed newbie members on the Board of Education who seem more interested in raising their personal profiles than in looking out for the interests of those they were elected to serve. They need to shut their yaps. All they are doing is encouraging a racial divide in the county and giving voucher-smitten legislators another reason to encourage parents to cut and run from our public schools. I’m not sure they care. An ego is a terrible thing to waste.
 By now, I think you have figured out that the more things change, the more they remain the same. The Marietta Daily Journal has been around a long time as Cobb’s local news source and in its new format plans be around for a long time to come. And I’m certainly not going anywhere. Don’t you, either. You and I are a team. Nothing will change that.

If social distancing is the norm for the foreseeable future, then we must face the facts; there are just so many things a human being can do confined inside a house alone, or with his/her partner, and only so many things a human can do outside the home without coming in contact with other humans.
 Everything we hear today says refrain from social contact. That's easier said than done. It's not within our nature to lock ourselves away or shun social interaction. Moreover, the sheer size of the world population makes not encountering someone impossible. That is, unless you live in some remote cabin in Alaska, or in an igloo at the North Pole, even Antarctica, or perhaps a thatched hut on some deserted island somewhere in the South Pacific wearing vegetation for clothing.
 Consider for a moment that at the dawn of agriculture, about 8000 B.C., the population of the world was approximately 5 million. Then, over the next 8,000 years up to 1 A.D., the population grew to 200 million. After the industrial revolution, a tremendous change occurred. Whereas, it had taken all of human history until around 1800 for the world population to reach one billion, the second billion was achieved in only 130 years (1930), the third billion in 30 years (1960), the fourth billion in 15 years (1974), and the fifth billion in only 13 years (1987).
 On March 20, 2020, the world population stood at 7,772,166,446 and counting, and on the same day, there were 171,347 births, 71,949 deaths and the population grew another 99,398. Good heaven, that's almost 50 percent of the population of Cape Cod, in only one day.
 These are the questions I ask myself. After you do a four-mile walk, or take a hike, ride a bike on the rail trail, play a round of golf, but only one at a time allowed on the tees and greens, and drive by the beach and watch the surf, what else is there to do outside during the Cape's early spring?
 We even had our hike through the dunes of Provincetown canceled by the Harwich Conservation Trust.
 Now I ask you, what about inside? How many books can you read before you go bug eyed? How many puzzles can an individual put together before you go stir crazy? How long can you sit in front of a TV binge watching Peaky Blinders? How many card games can a person play with his or her partner before you get on each other's nerves? How many cakes and cookies can someone bake without gaining weight?
 And, how many times can I watch Steve Harvey and Family Feud before Steve and his screaming contestants drive me nuts? Finally, you know you're bored when you plan your evening dinner chopping onions, carrots, celery and garlic at 9:30 in the morning because that's all there is to do and the excitement for the day is, what can we make for dinner?
 The next time someone asks what are you making for dinner I'd much rather say, "Reservations."
 We are explorers, and we get itchy when cooped up inside. However, we are also responsible, we listen to the experts and we do our part by staying home to protect ourselves and others around us. So goes these times we live in.
 Aristotle was right. "Man is by nature a social animal; an individual who is unsocial naturally and not accidentally is either beneath our notice or more than human. Society is something that precedes the individual. Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of society, is either a beast or a god."
 Stay safe, remain healthy and continue practicing social distancing.
 Together, we will see this through.

Wilfried Zaha believes he would have to suffer a broken leg for one of his opponents to be sent off four a foul on him.
 The Crystal Palace forward's wonderful individual effort earned Palace a 1-0 win at Huddersfield Town on Saturday, another game in which he made his frustration clear at challenges he was on the receiving end of.
 Mathias Jorgensen angered Zaha by pulling him down in the contest at the John Smith's Stadium, the Dane receiving a yellow card.
 Zaha has drawn 11 fouls so far this season, only Chelsea star Eden Hazard, Leicester's James Maddison and Will Hughes of Watford have been fouled more.
 Speaking to BBC Sport, Zaha said: "I feel like before anyone gets a red I'd have to get my leg broken or something. That's why I lose my head.
 "Some of the yellow cards, against Watford, the guy [Etienne Capoue] stood on the back of my calf and still a yellow card. It's like, 'why am I getting different treatment to other players?'
 "I just don't understand it and it's every week, every referee.
 "I tried to speak to referees but I don't know maybe tell my captain to get around him before the game or let him know or something because there's nothing I can do anymore.
 "It's hard because obviously, it doesn't make you want to go on a run because you feel like someone will come through the back of you or do whatever and you'll get injured.
 "It doesn't allow you to express yourself the way you normally want to express yourself, that's a difficulty but obviously at the same time I have to let my feet talk as well."

_Kevin Beattie comes out of the tunnel for the last time for the Blues in April 1981_
 Kevin Beattie, widely acknowledged as the greatest player in Town’s history, played in what turned out to be his last match for Ipswich which was a big one as the Blues faced Manchester City in the semi-final of the FA Cup at Villa Park in April 1981.
 He suffered a broken arm in the game and had to be helped off the pitch with the game goaless. It proved his final game for the club and sadly, The Blues weren’t able to reach their second FA Cup final as the game went into extra- time and Paul Power settled the result as he scored a free-kick to send his side to Wembley.
 _Kevin Beattie suffered a broken arm in his final game for the Blues against Man City in April 1981_
 By then, years of problems with Beattie’s knees had taken their toll, ending his England career in 1977 and increasingly interfering with his club availability. After the fifth in a series of unsuccessful operations in 1981 Beattie was forced to call time with Ipswich at the end of the year.

WASHINGTON (AP) — For several months, President Donald Trump and his officials have cast a fog of promises meant to reassure a country in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump and his team haven't delivered on critical ones.


  They talk numbers. Bewildering numbers about masks on the way. About tests being taken. About ships sailing to the rescue, breathing machines being built and shipped, field hospitals popping up, aircraft laden with supplies from abroad, dollars flowing to crippled businesses.


  Piercing that fog is the bottom-line reality that Americans are going without the medical supplies and much of the financial help they most need from the government at the very time they need it most — and were told they would have it.


  The U.S. now is at or near the height of COVID-19 sickness and death, experts believe.


  There's no question that on major fronts — masks, gowns, diagnostic tests, ventilators and more —- the federal government is pushing hard now to get up to speed. Impressive numbers are being floated for equipment and testing procedures in the pipeline.


  But in large measure they will arrive on the down slope of the pandemic, putting the U.S. in a better position should the same virus strike again but landing too late for this outbreak's lethal curve.

If you're sick with presumed COVID-19 but riding it out at home, chances are you haven't been tested. If you worry that you've been exposed and might be carrying and spreading the virus but so far feel fine, you're generally off the radar as well.


  Trump tries to assure people who need to fly that passengers are tested getting on and off flights. He is wrong. Instead, some major airports do screenings, which means asking passengers questions and checking their temperature, not swabbing their nasal passages to find out for sure.


  Many people with the virus will never get sick from it. Others who have it will get sick eventually. Both groups are contagious. But there is no capacity in the days of greatest danger to test apparently healthy people in large numbers, so precautionary distancing remains the best defense, like in ancient times.


  Within three weeks of China's New Year's Eve notification to global health authorities about a mysterious cluster of pneumonia cases, China had sequenced the genetic makeup of the virus, German scientists had developed a test for detecting it and the World Health Organization had adopted the test and was moving toward global distribution.


  Ten days behind, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bypassed the WHO test and sponsored their own, which was flawed out of the gate. Trump said the WHO test was flawed, but it wasn't.


  Precious time was lost as the U.S. test was corrected, distributed narrowly, then more broadly but still not up to par with the countries most on top of the crisis. Testing most lagged during the critical month of February as the virus took root in the U.S. population.

Juventus have assembled a squad worthy of being considered Champions League favourites, according to Federico Bernardeschi.


  The arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo, the competition's all-time leading scorer, has boosted the Bianconeri's hopes of lifting the trophy for the first time since 1996.


  Superstar forward Ronaldo was instrumental to Juve's exit in each of the previous two campaigns, scoring twice for Real Madrid in the 2017 final and then converting a controversial late penalty in last season's quarter-finals.


  Massimiliano Allegri's men must first survive a tough group containing Manchester United, Valencia and Young Boys if they are to deliver on Bernardeschi's confidence, but the Italy forward is adamant he and his team- mates can go all the way.


  "I feel this year we have a strong, complete squad with great players," the 24-year-old told Sky Sport Italy.


  "We are perhaps the favourite to win the Champions League, even if it will not be easy because it remains a very special competition and things can change at any moment.


  "It will be a great challenge. We feel strong enough to do the best we can, but obviously we have to prove it on the field."

 What the country needs right now is a plan.
   
 Actually it needs lots of plans for how things are going to work if COVID-19 sticks around for months or more. What are we going to do with schools? With businesses? With elections?
   
 Many of our elected officials, especially on the federal level, seem incapable of anticipating what's ahead. They're more focused on finding someone to blame for all the awful news.
   
 We would be better served if they also looked ahead and planned for what's to come.
   
 That includes what we should do about elections.
   
 Many are proposing that states adopt vote-by-mail systems for upcoming elections.
   
 It's a good idea and should be pursued, but not as the only option.
   
 Expanding use of vote centers and advanced voting, for example, would help spread voting out, making it easier to comply with social distancing requirements and stay-at-home orders.
   
 Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab refused to implement a state law that would have given counties those tools. Although legislators approved the use of vote centers about a year ago, Schwab said he didn't have time to write the rules and ensure all counties were informed, trained and equipped.
   
 That's not a response that bodes well for Kansas in its current health crisis.
   
 Of course, all might be fine by the Aug. 4 primary. People might not be worried about a coronavirus that has killed thousands and for which there is no vaccine.
   
 Perhaps President Donald Trump was right when he advised Americans that COVID-19 would just "disappear" one day soon.
   
 But it might be wise to have a plan in case that doesn't happen, in case the experts are right that the coronavirus will be a threat at some level until we have a vaccine, which is probably about a year away.
   
 The plan for how to hold elections should be taking shape now, and it should be ready to go by July 1, giving officials time to educate voters about changes.
   
 Michael Smith, a political science professor at Emporia State University, has proposed going to voting by mail.
   
 Such states as Washington, Oregon, Utah and Colorado use mail systems, which involve mailing ballots automatically to registered voters. Many of those states also offer other options as well.
   
 Given the present situation, Kansas might also want to set up lots of advance voting centers over at least a three-week period. Some should be near or at senior residential areas to facilitate voting among older voters.
   
 Officials also need to figure out how to provide opportunities to vote for those whose housing situation is changing or will change because of job losses and other circumstances.
   
 The plan could be adjustable, depending on the level of threat. Kansas voters would have more or fewer options, depending on the health advisories in effect, with specific elected and health officials making that determination.
   
 The aim should be to ensure that every eligible citizen is able to vote safely and is encouraged to do so.
   
 No Kansan should accept lack of time as an excuse for failing to develop and execute a plan.
   
 Holding fair and secure elections is a vital function of government. Those unable to fulfill that basic job function should resign now.
   
 In times such as these, real leaders don't look for excuses or people to blame. They look for answers.

During my many years of researching the subject of Henry Beston, I had the opportunity to meet several family members and friends of the "Outermost Householder." One who had particularly close ties to Beston was none other than Eastham's own George Rongner.
 "After meeting Henry Beston my life changed; he was a magnificent person and he talked so glowingly about nature and about history that I too became interested in that sort of thing," Rongner wrote in one of his many letters to me. "I think probably Henry Beston had more influence on my life as a youngster than any other single person."
 A veteran of 32 years with the U.S. Coast Guard, Rongner was a dear friend of Beston since Rongner was a child and Beston was staying at the Fo'castle on the beach of Eastham, the setting for Beston's book "The Outermost House."
 The two met in 1925, when Beston arrived at the Rongner home on Nauset Road in Eastham for dinner, a moment that Rongner said he was "captivated," and "enraptured with the way he spoke and with his vast experiences and knowledge."
 Rongner's father, Yngve, was a surfman with the Coast Guard at the Nauset station. Rongner, who died in 2010, often referred to Beston as his "quasi- uncle."
 Beston would tell the young Rongner of the exotic places he had visited and gave him his first lessons on birds, encouraged him to read and write, and how to identify constellations in the night sky. Whenever Beston left the beach (the writer actually stayed there on and off for a few years, not one consecutive year), he would get a ride to the train station and wave wildly from the car as he passed the Rongner house. Beston would always return with a book or two for his young friend.
 Beston's influence stuck with Rongner for the rest of his life. He authored a book, "Life Aboard a Coast Guard Lightship," and his Coast Guard uniform has been on display in the Lightship Room at the Coast Guard Heritage Museum in Barnstable.
 According to the book, "The Military of World Wars," Rongner enlisted in the Coast Guard in 1937, and was assigned to the USN American Legion, an attack transport, in 1941. That same year, he also participated in the initial landings at Guadalcanal.
 He later became a chief warrant officer, and was commanding officer of the Buzzards lightship and two buoy tenders. He was also commended for leading a boarding party aboard two Soviet vessels in 1965. He retired from the Coast Guard in 1970.
 He also recalled the reaction Beston, who served as an ambulance driver and naval correspondent in World War I, had to war: "He hated war with a vengeance, and the political world that caused such conflicts. 'Brutal. Destructive. Innocent women and children being killed.' He frowned as he uttered such descriptions."
 With everything that Rongner experienced, his last meeting with Beston in 1966, two years prior to the authors' passing, ranked as heart-wrenching as any. Rongner was in Maine and arranged to stop by Beston's "Chimney Farm" house in Nobleboro, but soon found that his hero was bound to a wheelchair. After a short visit and several long bear hugs from Beston, he said good-bye for the last time.
 As Rongner recalled, "My eyes become moist whenever my thoughts drift back to that final meeting with my hero."

If social distancing is the norm for the foreseeable future, then we must face the facts; there are just so many things a human being can do confined inside a house alone, or with his/her partner, and only so many things a human can do outside the home without coming in contact with other humans.


  Everything we hear today says refrain from social contact. That's easier said than done. It's not within our nature to lock ourselves away or shun social interaction. Moreover, the sheer size of the world population makes not encountering someone impossible. That is, unless you live in some remote cabin in Alaska, or in an igloo at the North Pole, even Antarctica, or perhaps a thatched hut on some deserted island somewhere in the South Pacific wearing vegetation for clothing.


  Consider for a moment that at the dawn of agriculture, about 8000 B.C., the population of the world was approximately 5 million. Then, over the next 8,000 years up to 1 A.D., the population grew to 200 million. After the industrial revolution, a tremendous change occurred. Whereas, it had taken all of human history until around 1800 for the world population to reach one billion, the second billion was achieved in only 130 years (1930), the third billion in 30 years (1960), the fourth billion in 15 years (1974), and the fifth billion in only 13 years (1987).


  On March 20, 2020, the world population stood at 7,772,166,446 and counting, and on the same day, there were 171,347 births, 71,949 deaths and the population grew another 99,398. Good heaven, that's almost 50 percent of the population of Cape Cod, in only one day.


  These are the questions I ask myself. After you do a four-mile walk, or take a hike, ride a bike on the rail trail, play a round of golf, but only one at a time allowed on the tees and greens, and drive by the beach and watch the surf, what else is there to do outside during the Cape's early spring?


  We even had our hike through the dunes of Provincetown canceled by the Harwich Conservation Trust.


  Now I ask you, what about inside? How many books can you read before you go bug eyed? How many puzzles can an individual put together before you go stir crazy? How long can you sit in front of a TV binge watching Peaky Blinders? How many card games can a person play with his or her partner before you get on each other's nerves? How many cakes and cookies can someone bake without gaining weight?


  And, how many times can I watch Steve Harvey and Family Feud before Steve and his screaming contestants drive me nuts? Finally, you know you're bored when you plan your evening dinner chopping onions, carrots, celery and garlic at 9:30 in the morning because that's all there is to do and the excitement for the day is, what can we make for dinner?


  The next time someone asks what are you making for dinner I'd much rather say, "Reservations."


  We are explorers, and we get itchy when cooped up inside. However, we are also responsible, we listen to the experts and we do our part by staying home to protect ourselves and others around us. So goes these times we live in.


  Aristotle was right. "Man is by nature a social animal; an individual who is unsocial naturally and not accidentally is either beneath our notice or more than human. Society is something that precedes the individual. Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of society, is either a beast or a god."


  Stay safe, remain healthy and continue practicing social distancing.


  Together, we will see this through.

Bloomberg) -- The $1.2 trillion U.S. junk-bond market has staged a marked recovery in recent days. But pull back the curtain and it's clear not all borrowers are reaping the benefits equally.
 For many of the riskiest credits, the situation remains as dire as ever, leaving them with little chance to access the financing they desperately need -- at least, not anytime soon. Risk premiums on bonds rated CCC remain near the widest since 2009 relative to securities a few notches higher in the B and BB buckets. The Federal Reserve's announcement Thursday that it will start buying debt recently downgraded to the highest junk tier could ultimately exacerbate the divergence, according to analysts, even as the broader market rallies.
 The growing disparity between speculative-grade issuers may signal that a wave of restructurings among the most leveraged companies is largely unavoidable, even if the global economy is able to turn the corner in the coming months. Barclays Plc said last week it expects high-yield defaults to reach 9% to 10% in 2020, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s forecast was even more bleak, predicting a trailing 12-month average of 13% later this year.
 "In periods of economic uncertainty or market uncertainty, as well as expectations of earnings declines, there is generally going to be a flight to quality overall because that uncertainty is magnified the further you go down the risk spectrum," said Steven Oh, global head of credit and fixed-income at PineBridge Investments.
 Oh said he's underweight CCC rated debt and is avoiding adding energy-sector risk in particular.
 Of all the measures used to gauge the strength of U.S. credit, the gap between investment-grade and high-yield risk premiums is among the most closely followed. U.S. junk bonds on average pay 5.52 percentage points more than investment-grade notes, down from a high of 7.27 percentage points late last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 But some market watchers now say the metric is concealing dangers lurking beneath the surface. Bonds in the CCC tier are trading at an average spread of 16.4 percentage points relative to Treasuries. Not only that, but the gap relative to B rated notes has ballooned to 8.62 percentage points, barely off last month's highs and near the widest since the depths of the financial crisis.
 Just as concerning, the spread between B rated and BB rated securities -- at 2.44 percentage points -- remains the widest since 2016.
 Shut Out
 As a consequence, the primary market has remained virtually shut for all but the highest-rated, most liquid speculative-grade issuers. BB rated Yum! Brands Inc. last week was the first company to raise funds in nearly a month when it sold $600 million of debt.
 Since then, companies including similarly-rated Restaurant Brands International Inc. and Wynn Resorts Ltd. have priced deals, while split-rated Ferrellgas has been the only credit with at least one CCC rating to tap the market.
 To make matters worse, investment-grade companies directly impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak such as Carnival Corp. and Nordstrom Inc. are turning to junk-bond buyers for financing. Even when transactions aren't being conducted off of bank high-yield desks, funds dedicated to the asset class are increasingly buying blue-chip deals amid attractive rates and a record spurt of supply, limiting market access for lower-rated issuers.
 Still, the biggest rally in high-yield debt in over two decades Thursday after the Fed's historic move to begin buying some speculative-grade corporate debt may be just the spark needed to unleash riskier deals.
 Bankers are talking to large corporations that have been waiting for the market to improve, according to people familiar with the matter. They're also engaged with private equity firms about options for their portfolio companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
 For their part, analysts at Barclays led by Bradley Rogoff called Thursday's market rally "extreme," saying in a note to clients that the additional Fed measures will provide strong support to the potentially hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bonds that are expected to fall into the BB tier in the coming months, but that for the rest of high yield, the stimulus "disappoints."
 Survival Prospects
 The Fed's decision may ultimately prompt money mangers who get crowded out of the BB space to reach for riskier credits, narrowing the yield gap, according to John McClain, a portfolio manager for Diamond Hill Capital Management.
 Others aren't so sure.
 "Your truly distressed credits may benefit at the margin as capital continues to flood into high yield, but the survival prospects are basically unchanged," said Noel Hebert, director of credit research at Bloomberg Intelligence. "The economy is still deteriorating and the Fed's program, while a temporary balm for asset prices, isn't altering demand for oil or the urge to hit the mall."

COVID-19 is caused by the novel SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it is resulting in many deaths. However, a large number of infected people are also recovering despite not having any specific treatment. This is because of antibodies produced within the body in response to the virus invasion.
 Over the years, passive transfer of antibodies obtained from the plasma of convalescent patients cured of infection has been used for treatment of numerous disease conditions such as Diphtheria, Tetanus, Rabies, and Ebola. Today such therapeutic antibodies can be produced in the laboratory by DNA- based recombinant technologies. Efforts are in full swing globally to produce therapeutic antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
 In India, one such effort is being led by Professor Vijay Chaudhary at the University of Delhi South Campus-Centre for Innovation in Infectious Disease Research, Education and Training (UDSC-CIIDRET), with the support of the Department of Biotechnology in the Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India.
 Professor Chaudhary’s group is isolating genes encoding antibodies, which can neutralise the SARS-CoV-2, using a large antibody library already available in-house as well as a library made from cells of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection.
 These antibody genes will be used to produce recombinant antibodies in the laboratory, which, if successful in neutralising the virus, will become a perennial source of antibodies against this virus, both for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes.
 This work is being undertaken as part of an Anti-COVID consortium under the leadership of Prof. Chaudhary and involving Dr. Amulya Panda at National Institute of Immunology and Dr. Sanjay Singh at Gennova Biopharmaceutical Limited, Pune (GBL).

The worldwide number of fatalities from the novel coronavirus pandemic rose to 103,141 on Saturday, according to a tally compiled by AFP at 1100 GMT from official sources. More than 1,700,760 declared cases have been registered in 193 countries and territories since the epidemic first emerged in China in December. Of these cases, at least 341,100 are now considered recovered.
 The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are only testing the most serious cases.
 Italy, which recorded its first death in late February, has had the most fatalities with 18,849 from 147,577 infections. The toll in the United States is not far behind with 18,777 deaths, and it has most infections in the world with 501,615.
 Spain has recorded 16,353 fatalities from 161,852 infections. France has reported 13,197 deaths and 124,869 infections followed by Britain with 8,958 deaths and 73,758 cases. China \-- excluding Hong Kong and Macau \-- has to date declared 3,339 deaths and 81,953 cases, with 77,525 recoveries. It reported just three new deaths and 46 new cases since 1900 GMT Friday.
 Europe has listed 871,047 cases and 71,335 deaths to date, the US and Canada together have 523,661 cases with 19,356 deaths, Asia 133,597 cases and 4,718 deaths, the Middle East 95,005 cases and 4,632 deaths, Latin America and the Caribbean 56,888 cases with 2,344 deaths, Africa 12,884 cases with 692 deaths and Oceania 7,687 cases with 64 deaths..
