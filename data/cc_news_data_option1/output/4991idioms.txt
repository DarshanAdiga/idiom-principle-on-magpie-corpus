Ford isn't giving up any details on the Megazilla project, but based on what we know about the standard version, we can guess how the engineers at Ford Performance will improve upon it. The first area we'd expect to see changed would be the cast-iron block. Sure, that's great for longevity, but it also weighs a lot (the engine by itself is a porcine 580 pounds).
 An aluminum-blocked Megazilla makes more sense from a performance perspective and would certainly give GM's LS-series of engines a run for their money. We wouldn't be surprised to see Ford add forced induction in the form of a supercharger to the motor. This would be a great answer to FCA's wild Hellephant crate engine and its 1,000 horsepower out of the box.
 Aside from the Megazilla news, Ford is also working on a manual transmission version of Godzilla's control pack that would allow you to run whatever transmission you saw fit behind the engine, rather than be stuck with the truck's automatic transmission, as it is now.
 We asked Ford Performance for more details but didn't hear back in time for publication.
 Ford's standard Godzilla engine is available for sale now from Ford Performance for a surprisingly reasonable $8,150 (not including the control pack that makes all the electronics work).
 What would you put a Godzilla engine in if you had your druthers?

 # 170 show up to donate blood at annual Thanksgiving blood drive
 Sean Ellertson
 St. James Plaindealer
 At the 16th annual Thanksgiving day blood drive, a total of 170 donors from the surrounding areas gave blood inside in the St. James Armory.
 A total of 127 whole blood units and 58 power red (double units) were donated, for a total of 185 units.
 "Every unit of blood collected can be separated and used by up to three different recipients," said Amanda Reinarts, Collections Specialist II with the American Red Cross. "We like to tell our donors, 'You just saved up to 3 lives with your one donation.' We saved so many lives today."
 Despite COVID-19 cases rising throughout the area, Reinarts says that the pandemic hasn't affected blood drives in a major way.
 "Thankfully, we haven't seen it affect our blood drives that much. Donors continue to come out. There was definitely a little bit of a lull when the pandemic first started happening, but since then we're as busy as we've ever been. People continue to donate because they know how important it is and we're doing the safety measures and precautions."
 Reinarts says she's not surprised by the continued support even through the pandemic.
 "I grew up in this area, and this is just how these people are," said Reinarts. "It doesn't surprise me at all knowing that we're the biggest region in the Red Cross as far as blood donations go. I know a lot of these people and I see them every year and they know how important this is."
 "The need for blood doesn't stop during a pandemic or during the holidays. So it's very significant that we don't stop collecting blood. We continue to need the blood. Every two seconds somebody needs blood. So regardless of what day it is, or the holiday, or the day of the week, blood collection is always going to be important and essential. Being that we are basically the only one in the Midwest that has this blood drive, we're doing a lot to keep the hospitals full."
 In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, facemasks were required by everyone in attendance, and staff members were required to wear gloves. Every surface that donors touched was wiped down immediately.

Much of the automotive industry is focusing on downsizing its engines for better fuel economy and packaging. However, Ford is flying in the face of that idea with the 7.3-liter truck engine that it's fitted to the current Super Duty trucks.
 The engine -- nicknamed Godzilla -- is also available from Ford Performance as a crate engine. This is exciting for performance enthusiasts for several reasons, but the Godzilla is still a standard truck engine at the end of the day. Ford's working on something that could change that, and it's called Megazilla, according to a video published by Performance Racing Industry in November.

The delays have added to the unprecedented tensions surrounding the transition, fueled by a president who refuses to concede that he lost the election and spent much of his tenure accusing the nation's spy agencies of disloyalty to him.
 A spokesman for the Biden transition team declined to comment, as did officials from the NSA and DIA.
 Current and former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said the delays have impaired the Biden team's ability to get up to speed on espionage operations against Russia, China, Iran and other U.S. adversaries.
 The inability to meet with the NSA was described as particularly worrisome. The agency is the largest U.S. intelligence service, and its eavesdropping capabilities have been a critical source of intelligence on threats as varied as weapons proliferation and foreign interference in U.S. elections.
 Officials said that rejections relayed this week to the Biden team cited seemingly petty procedural barriers.
 One person said the Pentagon had asked repeatedly for rosters of those who would take part in a visit, lists of topics, and estimates of time to be allotted — information that in some cases had been provided at the outset.

California certified its presidential election Friday and appointed 55 electors pledged to vote for Democrat Joe Biden, officially handing him the Electoral College majority needed to win the White House.
 Secretary of State Alex Padilla's formal approval of Biden's win in the state brought his tally of pledged electors so far to 279, according to a tally by The Associated Press. That’s just over the 270 threshold for victory.
 These steps in the election are often ignored formalities. But the hidden mechanics of electing a U.S. president have drawn new scrutiny this year as President Donald Trump continues to deny Biden's victory and pursues increasingly specious legal strategies aimed at overturning the results before they are finalized.
 Although it’s been apparent for weeks that Biden won the presidential election, his accrual of more than 270 electors is the first step toward the White House, said Edward B. Foley, a law professor at Ohio State University.
 “It is a legal milestone and the first milestone that has that status,” Foley said. “Everything prior to that was premised on what we call projections.”
 The electors named Friday will meet Dec. 14, along with counterparts in each state, to formally vote for the next president. Most states have laws binding their electors to the winner of the popular vote in their state, measures that were upheld by a Supreme Court decision this year. There have been no suggestions that any of Biden's pledged electors would contemplate not voting for him.

The West Indies crumbled in the face of a Tim Southee-led masterclass of swing, losing five wickets in the first session on day three of the first Test against New Zealand in Hamilton on Saturday.
 The visitors resumed the day at 49 without loss in reply to New Zealand's imposing 519 for seven, and by lunch they had been reduced to 114 for five.
 Jermaine Blackwood and Jason Holder were attempting to rebuild the innings with Blackwood on 18 and Holder on 14.
 In a dramatic two-hour period, Southee inspired the New Zealand pace pack with prodigious swing in the overcast conditions.
 The morning started positively for the West Indies when John Campbell clipped the first ball from Southee to the fine leg boundary.
 He advanced to 26 and gave the West Indies their first 50 opening stand in 13 innings since February last year.
 But that one scoring shot was Campbell's lot. Four balls later, he scooped a full-length delivery to Kane Williamson at mid-off and his innings was over.
 In Southee's following over, he produced a ball that swung late, caught the edge of Shamarh Brooks' bat and Ross Taylor completed the dismissal at first slip.
 West Indies dangerman Kraigg Brathwaite added one to his overnight 20 before he was caught behind.
 Brathwaite came into the Test on the back of a double century in the West Indies warm-up game against New Zealand A but he could not handle a Trent Boult delivery that pitched on the leg stump and jagged across the batsman.
 Darren Bravo had an early life when rapped on the pads by Southee but on review it showed the ball would have missed the leg stump by a wafer.
 But when New Zealand brought on the 2.03 metre (6ft 8in) Kyle Jamieson, he rattled Bravo with a rising ball that smacked him on the gloves and then bowled him two balls later with a full-length inswinger.
 Roston Chase followed immediately for 11, bowled by another good-length inswinger from Neil Wagner, who put away his notorious short-ball to make the most of the conditions.

EUGENE, Ore. (AP) — Nyara Sabally waited two years to take the floor for Oregon.
 The redshirt sophomore had 20 points and 10 rebounds in her first collegiate start and No. 10 Oregon set a school-record for consecutive victories with 22, opening Pac-12 Conference play with a 82-53 romp over Colorado on Friday.
 Oregon (3-0) broke the mark set in 1978-79. The Ducks also set a school record with their 21st straight home victory, topping the mark set from 1998-2000.
 Sabally — a 6-foot-5 sophomore whose sister, Satou, was an All-American last season for the Ducks — made all nine of her shots from the field, including one 3-pointer.
 “That’s definitely a first,” Sabally said about not missing a shot. “It’s fun to start the game, but at the same time, it doesn’t really bother me to come off the bench. It’s not any different. It just happened to be a good game today.”
 Sabally missed each of the last two seasons due to knee injuries. She's clearly happy to be back after the layoff. She played in the Ducks' first two games this season, but Friday marked her first start.

The James Bond movie franchise is a juggernaut, with 26 films to date (24 canonical, plus two rogues). Starting with Sean Connery, it's featured six different actors in the lead role, going up against countless power-mad villains. Along the way, the 007 franchise has delivered both gems and clunkers.
 It'll be a while longer before we can see how the next Bond movie, No Time to Die, stacks up against its predecessors. That film, likely the final one to star Daniel Craig, has been pushed back more than once by coronavirus concerns, and now it's scheduled to hit theaters on April 2.
 While you're waiting, you can satisfy your Bond cravings by revisiting the older 007 movies. Right now, for instance, you could go to YouTube, which is streaming most of the movies for free (with ads), from Connery's debut in Dr. No all the way to the third of Pierce Brosnan's outings, The World Is Not Enough. On cable TV, Epix and MTV have been showing various Bond films in spurts.
 If you're not sure where to start, check out our recommendations and full rundown on big-screen Bond. With the recent death of Connery at 90, you might well be inclined to start out with one of his seven turns as 007. (You could maybe also play a vintage Bond video game, or ponder the upcoming "Project 007" from IO Interactive.)
 You can also take a run through this ranking of James Bond movies, from worst to best. It's not arbitrary or one person's whim -- it's based on an aggregate of movie reviews as compiled by Metacritic.

DIRECT PAYMENTS
 President Trump has long supported another $1,200 round of direct payments to most Americans, subject to income limits that make upper-bracket taxpayers ineligible. House Democrats support the idea, but it is unpopular with many Senate Republicans and was left out of a scaled-back Senate GOP plan. A bipartisan bill by Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and others, leaves out the direct payments as well, and their up to $300 billion cost could render them too expensive for inclusion in the year-end package, though lawmakers ranging from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-Maine, to Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., are pushing to retain them.
 ___
 STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
 This is one of the trickiest issues in the talks — another round of aid to states and local governments to follow a $150 billion this spring. It's a top priority of Pelosi and other Democrats but is opposed by many Republicans, who warn it would bail out states run by Democrats like California and New York. Trump doesn't like the idea as well, but Pelosi's demands for the money have been slashed from earlier amounts approaching $1 trillion. Revenue losses due to COVID-19 haven't been as large as feared. But smaller localities left out of the first tranche of payments are eager for funding. A plan endorsed by moderates would provide $160 billion.
 ___
 LIABILITY SHIELD
 Businesses reopening during the pandemic have for months been seeking a shield against lawsuits claiming negligence for COVID-19 outbreaks. McConnell is the most potent backer of the idea and he's drafted sweeping protections against lawsuits for businesses, universities, and other organizations. The powerful trial lawyers lobby — which still holds great influence with Democrats — is opposed, and McConnell's fears of a wave of COVID-related lawsuits haven't materialized. Veteran Senate Judiciary Committee members Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, have been deputized to negotiate the issue, a sign the talks are at a serious stage.
 ___
 ODDS AND ENDS
 Numerous smaller items are ripe for inclusion, including $10 billion for the Postal Service, a $20 billion-plus deal adding food aid sought by Democrats and farm subsidies favored by Republicans, more than $100 billion in funding for schools seeking to reopen, along with funding for child care, Amtrak, transit systems, and health care providers.

Syracuse coach Dino Babers won't ever forget this most unusual season, even though he'd certainly like to with only one win and one game to play. And he most assuredly won't forget the contributions of senior Chris Elmore, who has taken the meaning of the word selflessness to a rare level.
 "Chris Elmore is so unselfish," Babers said. "We would not have been able to finish the season without him. It would have been 11 no-contests without Chris. I can't thank him enough for the unselfish act he did in keeping us afloat and keeping us running through these games."
 Syracuse has played every game on its schedule without a disruption. It's a testament to the athletic department's aggressive approach in combating the novel coronavirus, but keeping the season intact hasn't translated to success on the field. Syracuse (1-9, 1-8 Atlantic Coast Conference) has lost seven straight and is last in the conference with a date at No. 2 Notre Dame looming in Saturday's season finale.

THE COLONY, Texas (AP) — Jessica Korda was prepared for another bone-chilling round at Old American Golf Club. Maybe, a bit too prepared.
 “My immediate regret when I was on the front nine my kneecaps started to sweat and I didn’t have pants I could take off," Korda said. “What a beautiful day today was. I know it was really cold this morning, but way less wind than we could have imagined having, so spectacular day.”
 At the end of the day Friday, the 27-year-old Floridian had a share of the lead in the Volunteers of America Classic with Anna Nordqvist and 19-year-old Yealimi Noh.
 After the temperature never made it out of the 40s on Thursday, it was in the high 50s on Friday in the final tuneup before the U.S. Women’s Open next week at Champions Golf Club in Houston.
 “I kept telling my caddie,`Today would have been so nice to go on a hike with your dog, a cup of coffee, say how grateful you are for everything in your life,'" Korda said.
 Korda shot her second straight 2-under 69. The five-time LPGA Tour winner played the first 12 holes in 4 under, then dropped a stroke on the par-5 13th and parred the final five.

Si tratta di un percorso, il “Rehberger-Weg” (tradotto, sempicemente "via, sentiero Rehrberger"), che di fatto è un progetto artistico di arte pubblica, aperto a tutti, senza bisogno di pagare biglietti e godibile per sempre, seguendo i “24 Stops” disegnati dall’artista. Sono oggetti più o meno grandi e sempre colorati come è nello stile di Rehberger, famoso anche per il cangiante bar che ha riprogettato all’interno dei giardini della Biennale di Venezia per la sua 53° edizione. Anche in quel caso, per la caffetteria, Rehberger lavorò, come ora, ad un luogo “pubblico”, usando diversi metodi e mezzi stilistici, dalla pittura al design. Così come per il bar di Venezia anche per il Rehberger-Weg, il lavoro non è soltanto di tipo estetico, ma anche funzionale, con invito aperto alle persone ad interagire.
