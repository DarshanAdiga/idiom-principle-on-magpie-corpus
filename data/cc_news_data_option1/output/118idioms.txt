"If AAP leaders are guilty and murder accused then it is a matter of shame, the BJP should be in shame why they are roaming freely. For six years, BJP is in power at the Centre. Why don't they arrest them?" he told reporters in a press conference here.   "They are saying that he (Iqbal) is roaming freely for six years and today they are speaking about him only because he joined AAP. If they are not able to run the Delhi Police, then give them under our control. We will throw every guilty behind bars," the AAP leader said.   Iqbal, who joined AAP on Thursday has a stronghold in the Matia Mahal constituency in Delhi. He contested and won the 2013 assembly elections from JD(U).   Replying to Patra's allegations of appeasement politics, Sisodia said that everyone knows who does polarisation politics.   When being asked to comment on the controversy around ''Chhapaak'' movie, the AAP leader said: "It is very disgraceful to see people getting intimidated by films based on a social issue. How can they be scared of a movie which is based on an acid attack victim?"

Thus wrote Bernard Narokobi about putting down on paper the "History of Wautogik Village" in Papua New Guinea. Narokobi, an important late-20th- century political and cultural figure in that country, told Dobrin when he sent her the manuscript about his village that he could not claim ownership and publish it. He would've wanted to show his written account to elders‚Äî"knowledge holders"‚Äîso they could review it and make corrections, but the people he thought could do that had all died, he told Dobrin.

There are many ways to make a bearish technical argument for this market, but the most important thing to keep in mind is that, at this time, the trend is still upward.

GOSHEN ‚Äî An Elkhart man received a 20-year sentence Thursday after admitting he dealt cocaine in April.
 Julio Aguilar-Reyes, 25, was sentenced to the maximum allowed by the plea agreement he entered in Elkhart County Circuit Court in November. He was charged with the Level 2 felony following an investigation by the Elkhart County Intelligence and Covert Enforcement unit last spring.
 Additional counts were dismissed as part of his plea, including dealing methamphetamine as a Level 2 felony and a Level 6 felony as well as two counts of unlawful possession of a firearm, another Level 6 felony. Several pending misdemeanor cases were also dismissed and other potential charges that could have been filed were withdrawn.

Houseplants can have us gardening year-round. They add a decorative touch to a home, and they emit oxygen and help remove toxins to purify the air.      Shopping for your first houseplant or adding more to your collection can be an exciting experience. How does one choose a houseplant? I look for ones with interesting texture, foliage and form. More importantly does it appear healthy. Here are some tips when shopping for a houseplant and for maintaining it.      ‚Ä¢ CHOOSING A PLANT - Look for plants with healthy green foliage and dense, bushy growth. One with an abundance of closed buds is a better choice than one in full bloom. Always check for insects at the tips of new branches, at the places where the leaves join the stems and on the underside of the leaves.   ‚Ä¢ LIGHT - Plants grown only for attractive foliage require less light. Succulents or cacti and flowering plants require direct sunlight. Succulents and cacti do make ideal houseplants since indoors the humidity is dry, and they prefer that kind of environment.   ‚Ä¢ SPACE - Plants grow at different rates. For immediate gratification in a small area, Norfolk Pine, Dracena Marginata, Fiddle Leaf Fig tree, Schefflera and Rubber Tree are some serious contenders for making a statement in a small space.   ‚Ä¢ INDOOR TEMPERATURE - Many houseplants are tropical in origin, so they prefer high humidity. If you are in a climate where humidity is low indoors, you can raise the humidity several ways. Misting plants, keeping pots on water-filled trays or grouping plants near one another to trap existing moisture can help raise the humidity for houseplants.   ‚Ä¢ WATERING - The biggest problem is overwatering houseplants. Choose a container with good drainage. Add water to the top of the soil surface until water comes out the drainage holes. Or watering can be done by placing the pot into a container filled with water and leave it remain in the container for fifteen minutes. Tepid water is best for watering to avoid shocking plants and causing them to wilt.   ‚Ä¢ FEEDING - Read the care tag on the plant for fertilizing and keeping your plant healthy. If you are unsure about the feeding of a particular houseplant, experts at your local garden center or floral shop should be able to provide answers to your questions.   ‚Ä¢ MAINTENANCE - Plant foliage should be rinsed under a gentle stream of tepid water about every two weeks to remove dust or dirt. Larger plants may be harder to rinse, so with a soft, clean cloth, gently wipe the foliage. As you wipe the leaves, use your other hand to support the undersides of the leaves.   Keeping me company in my home are a variety of houseplants. They all have interesting foliage, texture and some even flower. A mini cactus, a dracaena, an English ivy, a bromeliad, an orchid, a kalanchoe and a bird's nest fern comprise my indoor garden.      Maybe you too will find a spot on your kitchen windowsill for a small succulent or an empty space for a beautiful orchid beside your bedside. Houseplants will reward you daily.

Researchers in the Marine Genomics Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), in collaboration with scientists from Mie Prefecture, Japan, have, using genome-wide genetic data from specimens collected across the western Pacific, elucidated how pearl oyster populations vary genetically and geographically. Their analyses provide insight into how these pearl oysters have adapted to environmental changes over time. Understanding the genetic structure of these populations will be crucial for developing effective and targeted conservation strategies for the species in light of climate change, the researchers said.

Eldredge seemed to blame men for not appreciating female-centric stories and framed it as some sort of character flaw that society needed to address: ‚ÄúIf many men haven‚Äôt wanted to give it a chance because they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs meant for them, we still have a way to go in considering all kinds of narratives about women to be deserving of thoughtful attention.‚Äù
 It‚Äôs not surprising that a story about the relationship between four Civil War-era sisters written over 150 years ago and with absolutely no battlefield scenes is not a favorite with the Xbox set.
 While there has always been some cross-gender interest in young adult literature like ‚ÄúA Separate Peace‚Äù and ‚ÄúCatcher in the Rye‚Äù that have strong male characters, there is a universality of message in those books. In other words, Holden Caulfield‚Äôs existential angst and the rough contours of Gene and Phinny‚Äôs tragic friendship have resonance beyond their masculinity.
