Third, the U.S. and Europe should work in tandem with other democracies to regain ground in standard setting and digital development—areas that were ceded to authoritarian states like China partially by the leadership vacuum left by the Trump administration. Together, EU leaders and the Biden administration should form democratic caucuses with other like-minded actors in multilateral organizations to promote technical standards based on openness, interoperability and competition. The U.S. and Europe should also work in a panoply of informal groupings aimed at good governance in the digital world. The U.K.’s D-10 initiative of democratic tech powers, the OECD and the G-7 will offer some markers to coordinate rules and provide guidelines in the democratic space. Finally, the U.S., EU and like-minded states should link connectivity, digital infrastructure and development in a way that provides a democratic answer to China’s Belt and Road Initiative and gives local communities more ownership of their digital futures. The EU remains a development powerhouse while the U.S. could leverage its technological advantages to engage developing economies.

PEARL RIVER COUNTY, Miss. (WLOX) - A Pearl River County man will spend at least 40 years in prison for the murder of his wife in the summer of 2018.Charles Bowman was sentenced Monday after being found guilty last month of second-degree murder and tampering with evidence in the death of his wife Kathleen. Judge Prentiss G. Harrell sentenced Bowman to 40 years in prison, with a minimum of 30 years to serve, on the second-degree murder charge; and ten years on the tampering with evidence charge to be served consecutively.Kathleen Bowman’s skeletal remains were found on their shared property on Owl Hoot Road. Deputies visited the home to perform a welfare check on Kathleen after receiving a call from concerned family members but only found her husband there.When they returned with a search warrant, Bowman was gone.That’s when authorities found Kathleen’s skeletal remains. Following his wife’s death, Bowman fled across the country and was later captured in Utah. According to U.S. Marshals, the alleged killer was spotted on the campground at a state park called Bear Lake after two weeks on the run.Pearl River County District Attorney Hal Kitrell said Kathleen Bowman’s two sons attended the sentencing, her daughter watched the proceedings via Zoom. Kitrell said Bowman did not speak when the judge asked if he wanted to address the court.Kitrell said this case was one of the most bizarre and challenging ever prosecuted by his office due to the many legal issues and witnesses from several states. Immediately after sentencing, Bowman was taken to the Central Mississippi Correctional Center in Rankin County for processing and to begin serving his sentence.Copyright 2020 WLOX.

In an interview, Walz explained he's trying to give people permission to say they disagree with him while still actually wearing a mask.
 He said when people complain to him about the mask mandate in his state (which happens all the time) he asks, "Why would you think I enjoy this at all?" He said he hates masks as much as everybody else.
 "None of these decisions is politically popular," Walz said. "I feel like John Lithgow in _Footloose_ — 'can't dance, can't do this, gotta do this' — and I just am that guy all the time."
 He knows pandemic fatigue is real, he knows people are tired of being bombarded with the data and the science, and he's convinced they are tired of hearing it from him. So he's trying to bring new faces to his press conferences, like hospital directors, who can talk directly about what they are seeing.
 But Walz remains hopeful. He said with vaccine progress putting a real light at the end of the tunnel, and COVID-19 raging out of control in frightening ways, he thinks there is a new receptiveness to masks — or at least he hopes there is.
 For his part, Biden has consistently worn a mask and has stuck to a consistent message. He tweeted last week: "Wearing a mask isn't a political statement — it's a patriotic duty."

 "Potential projects such as further irrigation options for the Special Areas; red tape reduction for our communities to aid the development process; a community development project for both Hanna and Youngstown; and a marketing program to attract both residents and businesses to the region, are just a few of the projects Cactus Corridor is pursuing," said Cactus Corridor Economic Development Corporation Manager Mark Nikota.
 "With the recent announcement of funding support from the federal government, we are embarking on an exciting array of projects that build on the past 4 years of planning done by the Climate Change Taskforce."
 "The hard work done by the task force and residents of our region, including the Community Action Team process, has been building to this point, where we can now put plans into action and work on tangible outcomes," Nikota explained.
 He said the goal of the group is to bring the community together to promote a "positive attitude and outlook" as well as get everyone on the same page "which is vital if our region is going to be successful."
 "What Cactus is asking to make the projects a success is for residents and businesses to be open and ready to be involved in the work that is being done," Nikota said.
 "Each of the projects has a community engagement piece which is designed to get feedback and support from a variety of stakeholders," he added.
 Community engagement, Nikota said, would be in the form of surveys, community town halls and one-on-one interviews.
 "Watch for the opportunity to be involved and take action with us to move the region forward," Nikota said.
 The CCEDC is a non-profit organization founded in 2012 by the Special Areas Board, the Town of Hanna, the Village of Youngstown and the Hanna Learning Centre with the purpose to identify, pursue and attract business and investments.

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The coronavirus pandemic has hurt the U.S. seafood industry due to a precipitous fall in imports and exports and a drop in catch of some species.Those are the findings of a group of scientists who sought to quantify the damage of the pandemic on America’s seafood business, which has also suffered in part because of its reliance on restaurant sales. Consumer demand for seafood at restaurants dropped by more than 70% during the early months of the pandemic, according to the scientists, who published their findings recently in the scientific journal Fish and Fisheries.Imports fell about 37% and exports about 43% over the first nine months of the year compared to 2019, the study said. The economic impact has been felt most severely in states that rely heavily on the seafood sector, such as Maine, Alaska and Louisiana, said Easton White, a University of Vermont biologist and the study’s lead author.FILE - In this Wednesday, March 25, 2020 photo, a fishing boat unloads its catch including just two grey sole at the Portland Fish Exchange in Portland, Maine. The Fish Exchange usually moves 60,000 pounds per week but has seen numbers drop by a third since the coronavirus outbreak.It hasn’t all been doom and gloom for the industry, as seafood delivery and home cooking have helped businesses weather the pandemic, White said. The industry will be in a better position to rebound after the pandemic if domestic consumers take more of an interest in fresh seafood, he said.“Shifting to these local markets is something that could be really helpful for recovery purposes,” White said. “The way forward is to focus on shortening the supply chain a little bit.”The study found that Alaska’s catch of halibut, a high-value fish, declined by 40% compared to the previous year through June. Statistics for many U.S. fisheries won’t be available until next year, but those findings dovetail with what many fishermen are seeing on the water.Maine’s catch of monkfish has dried up because of the lack of access to foreign markets such as Korea, said Ben Martens, executive director of the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association.“The prices just went so low, they couldn’t build a business doing that this year,” Martens said.The study confirms what members of the seafood industry have been hearing for months, said Kyle Foley, senior program manager for the seafood program at Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Foley, who was not involved in the study, said the findings make clear that the seafood industry needs more help from the federal government.The federal government allocated $300 million in CARES Act dollars to the seafood industry in May. The government announced $16 billion for farmers and ranchers that same month.“It helps to make the case for why there’s a need for more relief, which I think is our industry’s biggest concern across the supply chain in seafood,” Foley said.The study concludes that “only time will tell the full extent of COVID-19 on US fishing and seafood industries.” Gavin Gibbons, a spokesman for the National Fisheries Institute in McLean, Virginia, said the short-term findings reflect the difficulties the industry has experienced this year.“The closure of restaurant dinning has had a disproportionate effect on seafood and a pivot to retail has not made up for all of the lost sales,” Gibbons said.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

GULFPORT, Miss. (WLOX) - When Shayne Baca noticed foot traffic slowing down at his store, 1 Stop Vitamin Shop, he knew something had to change. With technology progressing, Baca quickly searched for ways to make money- coming across an app, that has helped him stay afloat during these challenging times.“Shipt is like my side hustle,” Baca said. A side hustle to make ends meet during COVID-19. “I started looking online, just Googling what apps can I make money and that was legit and Shipt was one of those,” said Baca. “So I applied. You don’t just sign up, you have to apply. You do videos, interviews, then a background check.”After the virtual interview process, he was hired and has been on the move ever since. Making his own schedule, he chooses to work seven days a week. “Normally my day starts, I get up about 5 or 6 a.m.,” he said. “I’ll just start listening for the app to say, ‘Hi, there’s something out there.’” Shipt delivers to more than 80 million households across the country. And while online grocery apps may have started out as a luxury service, Baca quickly learned they’re now a necessity for many.“It’s become essential because I’ve delivered to nursing homes to older people, people with health risk,” Baca said. “The amount of gratitude you get I think is 50 percent of the job, if you actually care about the customer themselves.”Baca said you can make anywhere from $10 a week with one delivery up to $1,000. It’s all up to you.“If you’re open with yourself and you actually get up early and you’re willing to go as late as the day will take you, you’re going to earn it. It’s not given to you. A lot of driving. A lot of detail work. You got to read, you got to pay attention,” said Baca.Baca said if he had to choose, his most favorite thing to shop for is baby food because it’s something that the family actually needs. “I guess because it’s like this is a child and they need it,” Baca said. “It’s nutrition and it’s so important and I just get a big kick out of doing a big baby order,” he said.He said he recently shopped an order that was more than $400 in baby clothes and items at Target. He said it took him awhile, but the family was so thankful because he was their eyes and ears inside the store. Copyright 2020 WLOX. All rights reserved.

The policy directive responds to previous calls to further secure space systems against cyber threats, in anticipation of the Trump administration’s establishment of the United States Space Force last year. Space systems have already suffered cyberattacks from both nation-states and criminal enterprises, and the Space Force will have a primary role to play in their defense. For example, in 2014 a Russian cyber espionage group known as Turla hacked a satellite internet provider to disguise cyber espionage operations against several countries, including the United States. A 2017 cyberattack targeted GPS satellites, spoofing the reported GPS positions for multiple ships in the Black Sea. The directive places cybersecurity at the forefront of space systems development. Existing U.S. policy on cybersecurity may shed light on just how the relevant government stakeholders may implement this new directive.

This letter concerns the creation of a task force mentioned at a meeting on September 2, 2020, when the board voted to hire five unarmed security monitors for our schools. Before the vote, President Karen Young announced that a task force would be created to gain public input about these positions and other security issues.
 We thank members of the board for understanding the importance of gathering ideas from the community as they forge policies to protect the physical and emotional safety of our students. We are confident in the board's ability to address community concerns, and we send this letter in a spirit of mutual trust and respect.
 Ideally, the new task force can serve as an open forum for addressing safety in our schools. It has come to our attention that the task force may have started to operate already, yet we have not heard about any efforts to recruit members from the community. This is startling, especially in light of the current climate of social injustice in Lockport.
 We have several recommendations about who should serve on an unbiased task force: They should include parents, teachers, and community members who live in Lockport. Members must be diverse in gender and ethnicity. They should be sensitive to the development and needs of students from across a wide range of backgrounds. Student representatives also should serve. And, in our opinion, no member should be a current or former law enforcement officer.
 As stated by board members, the main goal of the task force should be the physical and emotional security of students. To that end, we are concerned that the presence of even unarmed law enforcement officers (or former officers) may intimidate or appear to pose a threat to students, especially those of color.
 Unfortunately, studies have shown there is a disproportionate tendency of minors from disadvantaged backgrounds to fall into the school-to-prison pipeline. This stems from increasingly harsh school and municipal policies. We are concerned that Lockport seems to be following the trend of employing "resource officers" to patrol school hallways, often with little or no training in working with young people.
 Given the rise of social injustice across the nation, including police brutality and unfair treatment of people of color, we hope the task force will do everything in its power to stop systems of oppression in our own community.

WILMINGTON, Del. — Declaring “America is back,” President-elect Joe Biden introduced his national security team Tuesday, his first substantive offering of how he’ll shift from Trump-era “America First” policies by relying on experts from the Democratic establishment to be some of his most important advisers.
 “Together, these public servants will restore America globally, its global leadership and its moral leadership,” Biden said from a theater in his longtime home of Wilmington, Del. “It’s a team that reflects the fact that America is back, ready to lead the world, not retreat from it.”
 The nominees are all Washington veterans with ties to former President Barack Obama’s administration, a sign of Biden’s effort to resume some form of normalcy after the tumult of President Donald Trump’s four years in office. There are risks to the approach as Republicans plan attacks and progressives fret that Biden is tapping some officials who were too cautious and incremental the last time they held power.
 Still, Biden’s nominees were a clear departure from Trump, whose Cabinet has largely consisted of men, almost all of them white. Biden’s picks included several women and people of color, some of whom would break barriers if confirmed to their new positions.
 They stood behind Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris spaced apart and wearing masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, a contrast with Trump and many of his top aides who have largely eschewed facial coverings.
 The president-elect’s team includes Antony Blinken, a veteran foreign policy hand well-regarded on Capitol Hill whose ties to Biden go back about 20 years, for secretary of state; lawyer Alejandro Mayorkas to be homeland security secretary; veteran diplomat Linda Thomas-Greenfield to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; and Obama White House alumnus Jake Sullivan as national security adviser.
 Avril Haines, a former deputy director of the CIA, was picked to serve as director of national intelligence, the first woman to hold that post, and former Secretary of State John Kerry will make a curtain call as a special envoy on climate change. Kerry and Sullivan’s position will not require Senate confirmation.
 With the Senate’s balance of power hinging on two runoff races in Georgia that will be decided in January, some Senate Republicans have already expressed antipathy to Biden’s picks as little more than Obama world retreads.
 Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and potential 2024 presidential candidate, argued that Biden is surrounding himself with people who will go soft on China.
 Sen. Marco Rubio, another potential White House hopeful, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will consider Blinken’s nomination, broadly wrote off the early selections.
 “Biden’s cabinet picks went to Ivy League schools, have strong resumes, attend all the right conferences & will be polite & orderly caretakers of America’s decline,” Rubio tweeted.
 Biden said his choices “reflect the idea that we cannot meet these challenges with old thinking and unchanged habits.” He said he tasked them with reasserting global and moral leadership, a clear swipe at Trump, who has resisted many traditional foreign alliances.
 The president-elect said he was “struck” by how world leaders have repeatedly told him during congratulatory calls that they look forward to the U.S. “reasserting its historic role as a global leader” under his administration.
 Trump, who has debated recently whether to mount another presidential campaign in 2024, appeared to defend his worldview on Tuesday.
 “We shouldn’t go away from that — America First,” he said at the annual turkey pardon, a lighthearted pre-Thanksgiving White House tradition.
 While Trump expected total loyalty from his Cabinet and chafed at pushback from advisers, Biden said he expected advisers to tell me “what I need to know, not what I want to know.”
 Further drawing a contrast with Trump, Haines said she accepted Biden’s nomination knowing that “you value the perspective of the intelligence community, and that you will do so even when what I have to say may be inconvenient or difficult.”
 Haines said she has “never shied away from speaking truth to power” and added “that will be my charge as director of national intelligence.”
 Biden celebrated the diversity of his picks, offering a particularly poignant tribute to Thomas-Greenfield. The eldest of eight children who grew up in segregated Louisiana, she was the first to graduate from high school and college in her family. The diplomat, in turn, said that with his selections, Biden is achieving much more than a changing of the guard.
 “My fellow career diplomats and public servants around the world, I want to say to you, ‘America is back, multilateralism is back, diplomacy is back,’” Thomas-Greenfield said.
 Mayorkas, who is Cuban American, also offered a nod to his immigrant upbringing.
 “My father and mother brought me to this country to escape communism,” he said. “They cherished our democracy, and were intensely proud to become United States citizens, as was I.”
 But Mayorkas might pose the most difficult confirmation challenge from Biden’s early round of nominees.
 The Senate previously confirmed him in December 2013 by a party-line vote to be the deputy secretary of Homeland Security. The Senate was controlled by Democrats then, and all of the chamber’s Republicans voted against his confirmation mainly because he was then under investigation by the Obama- appointed inspector general in that department. At the time, the Senate historian’s office said it was unprecedented for the Senate to vote on a nominee who was under investigation.
 The inspector general, John Roth, found in March 2015 that Mayorkas, as director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, appeared to give special treatment to certain people as part of the visa program that gives residency preference to immigrants who agree to invest in the U.S. economy.
 Meanwhile, there were signs Tuesday that the stalled formal transition of power is now underway. Biden’s team now is in contact with all federal agencies, according to a transition official who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe developments that have not been announced.
 At the Pentagon, Kash Patel, chief of staff to the acting secretary of defense, is heading the department’s transition work. A transition task force has been assembled, led by Tom Muir, head of the Pentagon office that provides administrative and management services to all Defense Department facilities in the Washington area.
 Muir said the first meeting with Biden’s team was held virtually Tuesday morning and that he expected daily meetings to come — some virtually and some in person. He said normal accommodations for the Biden team have been made, including provision of briefing materials, video-teleconferencing capabilities, and office space inside the Pentagon.
 Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also said his agency is working to get briefing materials to Biden’s aides immediately and pledged a “professional, cooperative and collaborative” transition.
 The moves came a day after the head of the General Services Administration wrote the necessary letter of “ascertainment” acknowledging Biden as the apparent winner of the election, triggering the transition process.
 Trump, who continues to press a legal challenge to overturn the election results, again on Tuesday refused to concede his election loss.
 Trump tweeted that “the GSA does not determine who the next President of the United States will be.”

EL PASO, Texas (KFOX) - As El Paso’s healthcare workers give their all in the struggle against COVID-19, hospitals are getting some much- needed help from the military.“We are dealing with a pandemic unlike any other,” Air Force Staff Sgt. Blake Pfaff said.With El Paso hospitals and ICUs over capacity since last month due to one of the worst COVID-19 surges in the country, three Air Force medical teams have spent the past two weeks deployed to aid in the fight.“We came over here to University Medical Center. We onboarded here with medical staff who showed us around the hospital. After that, we hit the ground running and started working in some of the critical care sections and emergency medicine rooms,” Pfaff said.He is a member of the team at UMC, where the COVID-19 ICU is drawing comparisons to a war zone.“A lot of the people I work with have described it similar to Afghanistan, Iraq. There’s just a large amount of patients that were taking care of and a lot of critically sick patients,” Pfaff said.El Paso has seen a wave of deaths among COVID-19 patients that has overwhelmed the county morgue, with the county having to call in the National Guard to work through a backlog of nearly 240 bodies.The Air Force teams say they’re taking pride in the patients they have been able to save.“We do have some patients unfortunately losing their lives,” Pfaff said. “But I’d rather focus on the patients we are taking care of, the ones that we are able to take off the emergency ventilators.”Although members of the military are often called heroes for their service, the medical teams say the spotlight belongs on the healthcare workers who have been saving lives in El Paso since the pandemic began.“They’re the real heroes. Were just here in support of them,” Pfaff said.Copyright 2020 KFOX via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

POPLARVILLE, Miss. (WLOX) - A Pearl River County man accused of capital murder will stay behind bars, despite telling a judge this week that he fears for his safety.Dustin Gray appeared before Judge Prentiss Harrell on Monday for a bond reduction hearing. The judge heard arguments from both Gray and the prosecution on whether the bond should be reduced for the capital murder suspect or not.Willie Ray Q. Jones was last seen on July 6, 2020, around 3 a.m. in the Ponderosa area of Picayune.The judge ultimately ended up ruling against Gray, siding with the prosecution against a bond reduction.Gray and his 18-year-old brother Austin Brookshire are accused of robbing and murdering 28-year-old Willie Jones in July. Investigators say sometime during an eight-hour window on July 6-7, Dustin Gray and Brookshire shot Jones multiple times in the chest.In a motion filed earlier this month, Gray said he has concerns for his safety after recently being transferred from Marion Walthall Correctional Facility to the Pearl River County Jail. Since arriving in Pearl River County, Gray said he has been held in solitary confinement with minimal contact with the environment and other people.He also claimed that his calls and commissary privileges have been limited as is typically seen in prisoners who have already been convicted of a crime.The isolation is having a significant and substantial negative impact upon his mental and physical condition, states Gray’s motion to the court. The document goes on to say that Gray’s treatment amounts to “cruel and unusual punishment” and amounts to punishment rather than just holding while awaiting trial.18-year-old Austin Brookshire of Rankin CountyIn asking the court for a bond reduction, the motion also notes that Gray has lived his entire life in Pearl River County and is not a flight risk, and that bail should be granted because the proof that he is guilty is not evidence.“Since this defendant is facing a potential death sentence, or life in prison, when he is convicted, he would likely flee the jurisdiction as he has done once before,” states the prosecution in its answer to Gray’s original motion.The State of Mississippi successfully argued to the court on Monday that Gray is seen as a flight risk, reminding the judge that Gray and his wife Erica left the state after the murder of Willie Jones. The couple were apprehended in Colorado and later extradited back to Mississippi to face charges connected to Jones’ murder.Gray made that request despite a signed affidavit he reportedly gave the investigators that admitted to robbing and killing Jones, then led authorities to where Jones was buried.Dustin and Eric Gray were extradited back to Mississippi from Colorado, arriving by private plane in Pearl River County.Prosecutors also disputed Gray’s motion that there is not enough proof of his guilt, saying both Gray and his co-conspirator Austin Brookshier confessed to murdering Jones and stealing a large sum of money from him. Prosecutors went on to point out what they say is a wealth of physical evidence against Gray, namely that the victim’s blood was found in the defendant’s vehicle, as well as projectiles and ammunition matching the bullets used to kill Jones.“Simply put, the proof is overwhelming and the presumption great that this defendant is guilty of capital murder,” wrote the prosecution.Blackwell is also charged with capital murder in the death of Willie Jones, whose body was found in Hancock County two weeks after he went missing.Dustin Gray’s wife Erica and an unnamed teen are also charged with accessory after the fact in the capital murder case.Copyright 2020 WLOX.

Colin Kaepernick has no formal affiliation with TCU, nor did he ever play the Horned Frogs in a game, but he made a tangible impact on the university that extends deep into the mortar, and the success, of the school.
 This year is the 10th year anniversary of TCU's Rose Bowl season, which would not have been possible without the contributions of the ousted NFL quarterback, Mr. Kaepernick, and his Nevada Wolfpack.
 On Nov. 26, 2010, Kaepernick "led TCU" to the Rose Bowl when Nevada upset No. 3 Boise State. That upset ultimately changed the trajectory of a team, a school and a city.
 "I mean, just look at what TCU is today as a result of all that," former Nevada starting offensive lineman John Bender said.
 Just look at it. TCU is in the Big 12, its applications, enrollment and the property value of the surrounding neighborhoods all increased, in part, because of that season.

The treaty provides a framework that is crucial for understanding the policy directive in light of the defending forward cybersecurity posture. Article I dictates that the exploration and use of space must be “carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries” and that space must “be free for exploration and use by all States ... in accordance with international law.” Article III explains that applicable international law includes the U.N.

State activities in the exploration and use of outer space must be carried out “in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international co- operation and understanding.”

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Monday was not the first time doctors around the state have sounded the alarm. But this time, they’re concerned about the intensity of the spike and what will happen if nothing is changed.Nearly 2,000 COVID-19 cases were reported in Mississippi on Saturday. Those are the kinds of records healthcare leaders never wanted to see the state break.“What went through my mind was, it’s happening,” said Dr. Jennifer Bryan, Mississippi State Medical Association Board of Trustees Chair. “And this is the thing that we didn’t want to see happen but it is.”This go-around, it’s different because it’s not the unknown. Nurses like Lacey Ward know all too well what an increase in COVID-19 patients looks and feels like.“I’ve never questioned my job or being a nurse until this summer when the numbers were so bad,” explained UMMC ER nurse Lacey Ward. “It made me question if this is what I’m really meant to do because it was so defeating to come in and have so many people that were so sick and they were dying and couldn’t be with their loved ones.”UMMC is operating at capacity. It’s not all COVID patients but there are more of them than they had last week.“Here at this medical center, in this hospital, we could not handle a surge of a whole lot more patients coming at us,” noted UMMC vice chancellor for health affairs and dean of the school of medicine Dr. LouAnn Woodward.Meanwhile, a holiday that’s usually marked by family gatherings looms.“People are getting tired, just weary of all of the difficulties within their social realm and they’re letting their guard down,” said Dr. Alan Jones, UMMC assistant vice chancellor for clinical affairs.As cases rise and the holiday nears, testing is on the rise.“We were seeing about maybe 200 a day and Friday we did almost 450 test in our system,” explained Dr. Amy Hollman, medical director at MEA Medical Clinics Spillway location. “So, it’s more than doubled in the last few weeks.”But don’t mistake a negative test for an all clear for a family gathering.“Just because they test negative today doesn’t mean that they would test negative two days from now, especially if they’ve been out in the community,” noted Hollman.Dr. Woodward is also renewing a call for the governor to put a statewide mask mandate back in place.“Even with a statewide mask mandate, not 100 percent of the people are going to comply,” said Woodward. “You’ll still have people who don’t comply. But I think we have some reasonable evidence to believe that the county-by-county approach is not working. It’s maybe helping but it’s certainly not doing what we need it to do.”Copyright 2020 WLBT.

The _Morning Edition_ Song Project, in which musicians compose an original song about the COVID-19 era, returns this week with singer-songwriter Sarah Jarosz, Americana artist and one-third of the band I'm with Her. Jarosz had big plans for 2020: She recorded her first solo album in four years and had a new band and a big tour in the works. Naturally, it was tough when the pandemic shut everything down.
 "I made this record that I just believe in so much and had the best time making," Jarosz says. "And then everything changed, of course,"
 When she wrote her last album, Jarosz says tried to get out of her head and be more of a storyteller; her characters were people from small towns who dreamed of something more. At first, she tried to write a couple of songs like that for this project, but it didn't work.
 "I kind of realized, why I was hacking away at those [when] my experience this year has been my inner monologue, being in my head?" she says. "Once I realized that ... this song just poured out of me."

The song challenges the listener to rearrange their perspective to look at those feelings objectively and deal with them without becoming possessed by it.

The flight-tracking website FlightRadar24.com showed a Gulfstream IV private jet took off from Tel Aviv on Sunday night and flew south along the edge of Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula before turning toward Neom and landing. The flight took off from Neom over three hours later and followed the same route back to Tel Aviv. Pompeo, who was in Israel last week, traveled with a small group of American reporters on his trip throughout the Mideast, but left them at the Neom airport when he went into his visit with the crown prince.While Bahrain, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates have reached deals under the Trump administration to normalize ties with Israel, Saudi Arabia so far has remained out of reach. The Trump administration, as well as Netanyahu, would love to add the Saudis to that list before it leaves office in January. Israel’s Channel 12 TV, citing an anonymous diplomatic official, said the Saudis told Netanyahu and Pompeo that they are not ready to normalize ties with Israel.In Sudan, a military official said an Israeli delegation was in the country on Monday to discuss the normalization efforts. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the visit with the media.King Salman long has supported the Palestinians in their effort to secure an independent state as a condition for recognizing Israel. However, analysts and insiders suggest his 35-year-old son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, likely is more open to the idea of normalizing relations without major progress in the moribund peace process.Israel and Saudi Arabia have a shared interest in countering archrival Iran, and they have welcomed the Trump administration’s pressure campaign on the Iranians, which included withdrawing from the international nuclear deal with Iran and imposing tough economic sanctions on the Tehran government.The reported meeting puts even more pressure on Iran ahead of an incoming Biden administration that has signaled a potential willingness to return to the 2015 nuclear deal.“I think there’s a message to Iran. Look, there’s a front against you. There’s two months to go to the new administration. Beware. We are on the same page,” said Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, a prestigious Israeli think tank.In an apparent message to President-elect Joe Biden, Netanyahu said in a speech Sunday evening, shortly before the reported trip to Saudi Arabia: “We must not return to the previous nuclear deal.”In the same speech, Netanyahu also praised “trailblazing Arab leaders who understand the benefits of peace” and predicted “we will see other states that widen the circle of peace.”In another possible reference to the Saudi meeting, a Netanyahu aide, Topaz Luk, accused Netanyahu’s rival and coalition partner, Defense Minister Benny Gantz, of “playing politics at the same time that the prime minister is making peace.” Gantz on Sunday launched an investigation into Israel’s purchase of German submarines — a scandal that has turned several close Netanyahu confidants into criminal suspects. Netanyahu himself is not a suspect.Gantz, who also holds the title of alternate prime minister, said he had not been notified of the meeting and angrily said Netanyahu behaved irresponsibly by allowing such a sensitive trip to be leaked to the media.The reported visit Sunday night to Neom, still a largely undeveloped desert region alongside the north end of the Red Sea, also reflected Prince Mohammed’s ambitions. It brought two world leaders to Neom, which he hopes will become a futuristic, skyline-studded Saudi version of Dubai that will offer the kingdom jobs and cement a future beyond its vast crude oil reserves. It also would reframe a rule so far colored by the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the kingdom’s grinding war in Yemen. It was unclear where the three men met, though the Saudi royal family has massive mansions along the turquoise waters of the Red Sea, with a major golf course. Netanyahu has long signaled back-channel relations with the Saudis, though the nations have never officially confirmed a meeting between their leaders. But Saudi Arabia appears to have given its blessing to the decisions of its Gulf neighbors, the UAE and Bahrain, to establish ties with Israel. The kingdom approved the use of Saudi airspace for Israeli flights to the UAE. Bahrain normalizing ties also suggest at least a Saudi acquiescence to the idea, as the island kingdom relies on Riyadh.___Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
