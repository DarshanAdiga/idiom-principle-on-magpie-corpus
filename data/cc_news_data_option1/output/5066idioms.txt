Arizona Cardinals Defense. There is something wrong with the redbirds from Phoenix. The Cardinals are on a three-game losing streak and are on the brink of missing the playoffs. Even though the Cardinals are continuing to watch the playoff hopes flush down the drain, their defense should be able to help them bounce back. This week, the Cardinals will face a Giants offense that has scored the second-least points in the league. With Colt McCoy still leading the offense for the G-Men, the Budda Baker and the Cardinals defense could be a sleeper waiver wire pick up for fantasy managers in need of a replacement.

Segundo o portal, o clube paulista está disposto a trocar Tellez e tem vantagem na negociação. Além disso, uma das maiores esperanças do Fluminense era o fato do ex-técnico Odair Hellmann já ter trabalhado com o atacante no Internacional. Com a saída do comandante, a situação ficou mais complicada. Na atual temporada, Nico López tem seis gols em 11 jogos disputados pelo Tigres, no Campeonato Mexicano, mas amarga a reserva no time comandado pelo técnico brasileiro Tuca Ferretti.

The NFL's medical director says all procedures followed before the Baltimore Ravens' game Tuesday night when receiver Dez Bryant tested positive for COVID-19 were done properly and in the same manner as for every case. Bryant had an inconclusive test result after he was active for the game. He was removed from the field during warmups and tested again. The league and the Ravens then conducted contact tracing, but found no close contacts that would have caused an interruption in playing the game against Dallas, nor the removal of other players or team personnel. “I made the final determination that there were no high-risk close contacts to the case, so there was no need to remove anyone else,” Dr. Allen Sills said Wednesday. “I would say it was a very straightforward review simply because there were very few contacts identified by the data. I think that’s a reflection of the fact that this club has been under our intensive protocol and certainly has done a tremendous job with compliance around their facility leading up to the game ... \"So there were simply very few contacts to be reviewed, and with the cooperation of the player involved, we did not identify any other worrisome contacts. “But the same exact process was followed in this case as we do in every case. We made that determination using the same group of people and the same process, and the fact that we were able to do it fairly quickly is not reflective a lack of thoroughness in the process. It’s just simply the amount of data to be sorted through that allowed us to do that.” Baltimore, which won the game 34-17, couldn't replace Bryant on the roster. “That was a big challenge. The timing of this thing, it’s a crazy kind of a deal,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \"But we had already...

As a flatlander from Nebraska, she also adapted quickly to loving the mountains and accompanied her husband during the summers on many horseback rides to the backcountry. She even looked forward to the rides in the fall during the elk hunting season.
 When her husband passed away in December of 1991, Irene did not quit living. She continued playing music with the Old Time Fiddlers Association and also became a strong member of the Park County Historical Society. Loving history as she did, she became a strong right arm for her daughter Phyllis, who for 20 years organized and directed historical Pony Express reenactment events.
 During this time, Irene adopted the name of “Prairie Rose” and dressed in boots, leather and fringes, played her fiddle at all Pony Express events. Prairie Rose along with her lively fiddle often graced the front pages of Wyoming newspapers.
 In her later years, she became known as “Foxy” to many. She constantly found places to lend a hand to her friends and to the community. She loved driving her Subaru, so off she and her weenie dog would go to escort her elderly friends around that could no longer drive. She also joined the team of “Rolling Meals,” where a happy smile always accompanied the meal. She never met a stranger. Irene, still known as “Foxy,” spent the last three years of her life on earth at the Cedarwood Care Center in Red Lodge.
 She loved Red Lodge. It always reminded her of the small towns in Nebraska that she came from, and because of her love for animals, she was always thrilled when the wild turkeys walked past her windows. Once one even looked in at her.
 Irene will live on in the memories of all who knew her. No services are planned at this time. Cremation has taken place and as she had wished, she will be allowed to float away on the winds of Wyoming alongside her husband with only a small family ceremony.
 Condolences to Irene's family can be sent on her memorial page at BallardFH.com.

So I’m roofing when from my boom box I hear, “Everyone considered him the coward of the County …” I was no milquetoast, but the stanza, “There’s someone for everyone, and Tommy’s love was Becky …” infected my very being.
 In a nutshell, Tommy’s inmate father made him swear he’d always walk away from a fight … “Son, you don’t have to fight to be a man.” And Tommy always _did_ turn the other cheek, till that day he came home to find Becky sobbing in her torn dress. He knew the three Gatlin boys had come a-callin’.
 Tommy put dad’s picture down and headed to the local bar (the Tic Toc, if you will). When he turned away from an approaching Gatlin, the bully sneered, “Hey look! Ol’ Yellas’s leavin’, but you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy locked the door.”
 Twenty years of crawlin’ bottled up inside him, he wasn’t holding nothing back; he let ‘em have it all. When finished, not a Gatlin boy was standing, his final right cross words, “This one’s for Becky.”
 That day, I _became_ that coward of the county, ready to avenge any disrespect to my Becky (providing they weren’t _too_ tough). Point is: that was my song that particular summer. It wasn’t till a year later when she turned psycho and I couldn’t get her out of my house, this coward of the county became the village idiot again.
 I’ve since adopted many songs as my legacy. “The tears of a clown where there’s no one around” is a tragic plight indeed.

America Movil has reacted strongly to the latest attempt by Mexican telecommunications regulator IFT to curb its dominance of the sector, vowing to challenge the new rules in accordance with applicable law. In its delayed review of the 2014 ruling declaring America Movil a "dominant agent" in the telecommunications sector, the IFT ordered the company's Telcel, Telnor and Telmex units to limit a number of charges, above all the fees payable for unlocking smartphones if customers cancel their postpay contract. Such fees can no longer be charged to customers who have been with the operator for at least 6 months.
 Additional new rules include notifying customers when a promotional period ends, ending surcharges for out-of-network roaming and providing further details and reports for the watchdog’s regular economic replicability analysis. In a previous review of the dominance provisions, the IFT ordered a “functional separation” of Telmex’s fixed line retail and wholesale divisions with a view to boosting competition in the sector, a decision America Movil is still challenging.
 In a statement, America Movil said the IFT’s latest decision “is not based on an integral evaluation in terms of competition of the different markets in the Mexican telecommunications sector,” adding that the new rules do not take into account “the profound changes in the Mexican telecommunications sector within six years from the imposition of the asymmetric regulations and the effective competition that exists in fixed and mobile services”.
 However, six years after the imposition of the first antitrust curbs, the company’s Telcel unit still continues to dominate the Mexican mobile market, accounting for over 70 percent of the country’s revenues, ahead of rivals AT&T Mexico with 19 percent and Telefonica’s Movistar unit with 9 percent. In terms of customers, Telcel had 77.2 million at the end of Q1, compared to Movistar’s 25.5 million and AT&T’s 19.2 million.

NEW DELHI: The Center has enabled nine states to raise more than Rs 23.5 billion through market loans after completing required reform on the 'One Nation Ration Card, One' to be eligible for additional fundraising .   Those eligible for additional loans after completing the Public Distribution System reforms are Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, Tripura and UP. UP is the largest beneficiary and can raise about Rs 5,000 crore through the loan window, followed by Karnataka with Rs 4,500 crore. To be eligible for additional loans, states must complete stipulated reforms by the end of December and the Center expects more states to follow suit.   The implementation of the 'One Nation One Ration Card' scheme was one of the areas identified for the reforms to be eligible for additional market loans of 2% of the state's gross domestic product during 2020-21, with others related to steps to facilitate the business reform, reforms of local urban agencies / public services and reforms of the electricity sector. These had been pointed out by the Finance Commission.   The Center decided to prioritize the portability scheme of the ration card after the national shutdown due to the massive movement of migrants from large urban centers to their homes in UP and other states.

NEW YORK (AP) — Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs are No. 1 again. At least for this week. After holding off the Denver Broncos, the Chiefs moved up a spot and regained the top place in the latest AP Pro32 poll. The defending champs received 11 of the 12 first-place votes for 383 points in balloting Wednesday by media members who regularly cover the NFL. “Patrick Mahomes continues to solidify his case for a second regular-season MVP,” Newsday's Bob Glauber said. “In fact, it’s getting to the point where it’s not even close for second.” The Chiefs head to Florida on Sunday to take on the improving Miami Dolphins. “The 2020 Dolphins have already exceeded expectations, but have only one victory (the Los Angeles Rams) against a team currently above .500,” Sirius XM's Alex Marvez said. “That’s what makes Sunday’s matchup against visiting Kansas City such an interesting measuring stick of how legitimate Miami is heading into a tough four-game stretch to end the season.” The surging New Orleans Saints, who have won nine in a row, also gained a spot to No. 2 in the poll.

The problem with the pharma industry is that success with blockbuster drugs is uncertain and often finds quick competition even with successes. Experts can place probabilities on drug pipelines but I don't feel able to do that and I'm pretty sure Buffett doesn't either, so he just fired a scatter at a cluster of them. Perhaps the pandemic brought them to his attention. The sizes in which he bought were interesting - more than $1.8 billion for Bristol Myers, Abbvie, and Merck, but only $136 million of Pfizer. I suspect that his reasons accord with my own view that COVID vaccines will provide a nice one-time pop and some good PR for the successful companies but probably nothing transformative in the long run despite having driven up the stock prices a bit.
 Both the Japanese trading companies and the pharmaceuticals are bond-like stocks with much of the return likely to come from dividends along with the possibility that one or two in each category will produce moderate growth or an upgrade of PE. Buffett explained his airline purchases in more or less the same terms - dividends and buybacks even without passenger and revenue growth. In buying on this basis, Buffett reveals that for some of Buffett's cash the time has come to accept that time is up for deploying cash and a moderate improvement on the zero return of short T-Bills, maybe 4-5% after taxes, does not have to equal Berkshire's own internal return of 9% or so.
 The third major purchase so far in 2020 was a gas transmission and storage asset bought from Dominion Energy (D). This was a $10 billion deal ($4 billion cash plus assumption of debt) announced on July 5. It followed a series of similar bolt-on additions to Berkshire Energy - very much a typical Buffett/Greg Abel deal. Gas is out of favor, of course, but this has the upside that it's going to be hard to build new pipelines. An insider in the area of clean energy informs me that as gas usage recedes, the pipeline structure will have an important and profitable role in carbon capture by moving CO2 to storage. Berkshire had information and knowledge of the sector at least equal to that of the seller - a motivated seller in any event. Statistical examination of the deal from the perspective of both buyer and seller suggests that Berkshire had much the better of it.

 PEORIA - With service suspended since May, Delta Airlines has decided to permanently discontinue service in Peoria.
 In May, Delta petitioned the US Department of Transportation to suspend service at Gen. Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport beginning in June. Last week Delta informed the airport that they were changing the suspension to a termination, according to a news release issued by the airport Wednesday.
 Across the nation the airline industry has been hit hard by decreasing air travel caused by the pandemic. After widespread quarantines were instituted in March, traffic dropped 96 percent at the Peoria airport, with a total of just 2,928 travelers in May compared to 59,321 travelers the previous year.
 “We will have to work hard with the business community to attract Delta back to PIA,” said airport director Gene Olson in a prepared statement “The community recently showed great support to help us attract Nashville service on Allegiant. We will need to see that same type of community backing in order to entice Delta back in the future.”
 American Airlines, United, and Allegiant still provide service at the Peoria Airport, with direct flights to Dallas, Charlotte, Chicago, Ft. Myers, Orlando, Tampa, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. Flights to Nashville and Destin are offered seasonally.

A milestone in science was achieved in 2001 when the U.S. and British governments announced completion of the human genome sequence. Even though this detailed description of our genes, and the technologies that were created to achieve it, have helped pinpoint the causes of many diseases, it has failed to explain the root causes of others. What has become clear is that human health depends not only on the genome but also on proteins, the products of genes which do the work of cells, tissues and organs and which constitute the structural form of all living things.
 Proteins are elegant and intricate molecular machines with 3D structures that create energy to power our bodies, transmit signals to tell us when we are hungry, and create thoughts and memories; almost every physiological process is performed or regulated by a protein. Proteins are synthesized as a single strand of amino acids that is folded into a three-dimensional structure, but what tells the protein how and when to fold has remained a mystery. Christian Anfinsen was awarded the 1972 Nobel Prize in chemistry for showing that the amino acid sequence of a protein influences the specific way it folds. Experimentally determining the 3D fold of a protein is a difficult and tedious process requiring expensive instruments and often years of work, and many Nobel Prizes have been awarded for the determination of the structure of a single protein.
 An even more elusive goal in science has been to accurately predict a 3D structure of a protein solely from its amino acid sequence, and the 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to pioneers in the field of protein folding predictions. As academic scientists labored on this challenge over the years, their methods have improved with experience and improvements in computing power. Since 1994 a biennial competition has been held for scientists to test new methods to predict the structures of unknown proteins based simply on the amino acid sequence, and this competition has helped drive advances in the field.
 When private companies are developing new technologies, they often join academic scientists to tackle big challenges such as protein folding. Thus, in 2018, a Google company (DeepMind) with deep pockets, algorithmic learning and powerful computing stepped into the protein folding competition and has since dominated it. In the recently completed 2020 protein folding competition, DeepMind’s artificial intelligence-based program AlphaFold did so well — with some near perfect predictions — that scientists consider the protein folding problem essentially solved with only details to fill in.

Tyler Higbee, Los Angeles Rams. The Rams on paper have one of the most well- rounded teams in the league. They have the third-ranked offense and second- ranked defense in total yards per game in the league this season. While the Rams offense has seen a growth in success, Higbee has been surprisingly silent, surpassing double-digit points in fantasy only once since Week 3. Higbee’s performance isn’t looking good as this week, the Rams will be up against a Patriots defense that has given up the least points to tight ends in the league. Higbee is no longer a fantasy reliable tight end until proven otherwise.

MEDICINE PARK, Okla. (TNN) - The Medicine Park Fire Department is building a second fire station that will drastically cut down on response times.Currently, the Medicine Park Fire Station sits in the heart of downtown Medicine Park.“We cover a lot of area out here and the fire station we have is in the center of town. Sometimes when we have festivals and events it gets really crowded and gets really hard to get out. We’ve been working on this thing for actually a couple of years trying to put it together,” said Medicine Park Fire Chief David McCoy. That station will remain active but the new one, right off of Highway 58 by Lake Lawtonka, will help cut down on response times for calls by the lake.“We have three or four firefighters that live within a half a mile of here. They have to go back around to Medicine Park, you’re talking 5 or 10 minutes to get there and then 5 to 10 minutes to get back,” McCoy said. Cutting those response times also reduces the station’s ISO rating, saving residents money on their insurance.“It’s kind of a stimulus for everybody. It’s a few hundred dollars a year that lives in this area that has insurance on their homes. We started as a ten but were down to a five/five. Hopefully, we can get another point or two shaved off of that, which would really benefit everyone in the area,” McCoy said. Chief McCoy said this station has been in the works for years and wouldn’t have been possible without the landowners donating the land, The Comanche County Industrial Development Authority, lots of volunteers and the Comanche County Commissioners. He hopes to have the building finished by Christmas and have their equipment stored there in the next 6 to 8 weeks. Copyright 2020 Texoma News Network. All rights reserved.

I assume some of you will have noticed that Floodgap was down for a couple of days -- though I wouldn't know, since it wasn't receiving E-mail during the downtime. Being 2020 the problem turned out to be a cavalcade of simultaneous major failures including the complete loss of the main network backbone's power supply. Thus is the occasional "joy" of running a home server room. It is now on a backup rerouted supply while new parts are ordered and all services including TenFourFox and `gopher.floodgap.com` should be back up and running. Note that there will be some reduced redundancy until I can effect definitive repairs but most users shouldn't be affected.

More than a third of Americans live in areas where hospitals are running critically short of intensive care beds, federal data show, revealing a newly detailed picture of the nation’s hospital crisis during the deadliest week of the Covid-19 epidemic.
   
 Hospitals serving more than 100 million Americans reported having fewer than 15 percent of intensive care beds still available as of last week, according to a Times analysis of data reported by hospitals and released by the Department of Health and Human Services.
   
 Many areas are even worse off: One in 10 Americans — across a large swath of the Midwest, South and Southwest — lives in an area where intensive care beds are either completely full, or fewer than 5 percent of beds are available. At these levels, experts say maintaining existing standards of care for the sickest patients may be difficult or impossible.

NEW YORK (AP) — Al Michaels refers to his lack of baseball for much of his career “the one regret I might have.” An absence from regular baseball broadcasts for the past quarter-century didn't prevent the 76-year- old from reaching the Hall of Fame. Michaels was voted the Ford C. Frick Award for broadcast excellence by the Hall on Wednesday and will be honored July 24 during the Hall's induction weekend. “This is able now to take me back to to the beginning, because I really feel in a way since it’s been so long since I have done baseball that it’s like an out-of-body experience, like somebody else did this,” he said. \"It’s like the circle is complete.” He broadcast for Hawaii in the Triple-A Pacific Coast League from 1968-70, the Cincinnati Reds from 1971-73 and the San Francisco Giants 1974-76. Michaels gained a national spotlight when ABC had MLB rights from 1976-89 and again in 1994 and ’95, coverage interrupted by the players’ strike. He didn’t broadcast baseball again until a game on the MLB Network in 2011. His best-remembered baseball telecast was when an earthquake struck at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park before Game 3 of the 1989 World Series. Michaels was broadcasting with Tim McCarver when the quake struck moments before the scheduled start. “Well, I don’t know if we’re on the air or not and I’m not sure I care at this particular moment but we are. Well folks, that’s the greatest open in the history of television, bar none,\" he said. “We're still here. We are still as we can well on the air, and I guess you are hearing us, even though we have no picture and no return audio. And we will be back, we hope, from San Francisco in just a moment.” “I just had to remain very calm,” he recalled Wednesday. “And I...

To help combat that issue, many offices are offering customers without an appointment a spot on a “standby” list. These customers are required to wait in the office and are assisted in the event of a cancelation or no-show. The number of standby appointments available is limited to ensure all customers who are placed on the list will be served by the end of the day.
