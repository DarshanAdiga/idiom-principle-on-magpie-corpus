These critical factors therefore present a deadly possible reality. Easing governmental restrictions and protection measures without a widely available testing and therapeutic solution may be the ultimate recipe for a second, or even multiple future deadly waves. Thus, local and national governments must continue to urge and enforce strict containment methods, as lack of doing so will only be more detrimental in the long run. This, in conjunction with an increased emphasis on testing and a widespread effort to develop a vaccine, is the only way that the world may be able to soften the blow of what is yet to come from this deadly pandemic.

According to _The Last Dance_ , Pippen began having problems regarding his contract as the 1997-98 NBA season began. Pippen had signed a seven-year contract with the Bulls which earned him $18 million. They showed that Pippen ultimately ended up missing a significant number of games due to his surgery so he did not miss the summer, along with demanding a trade as he was not being paid the right amount. As per _ESPN_ , Pippen was the sixth-highest- player in the Bulls roster that season and came in at 122 on the list of the highest-paid players in the NBA. Green, who talked about the contract 26 minutes into his interview with _Uninterrupted_ , called Pippen's contract 'horrible'.

It’s a fine lecture from people not missing a paycheck; people who view a day of hard work as when the “T” key on the computer gets stuck and they have to shake a crumb out of it before they’re able to type “racist” again without frustration. When your biggest concern for your physical wellbeing on the job is carpal tunnel syndrome you might not be an authority on the struggle to make ends meet. When doing your work involves an hourly reminder from your Apple Watch to stand up for a minute, maybe you aren’t an authority on anyone’s daily struggle to survive. And if your livelihood involves crying racism at the top of your lungs in a Pavlovian response to everything in blind loyalty to a political party, you aren’t worth the molecules that make up your body.

SLIDELL, La. (WVUE) - Family members welcomed home their 84-year-old matriarch after her last cancer treatment, while also practicing social distancing.Rosemary Cox was greeted by her large family after she was released from Slidell Memorial Hospital Tuesday morning."This is my life right here," Cox said, as she looked at her loved ones.“This is her second bout with cancer. She’s been in remission for a few years and then the b-cell lymphoma came back. She started her radiation treatments and today’s her last day,” Loretta Crocker said.She said her mother started radiation treatments in February."She went in the hospital and had a lung scan, and found out it was also in her lungs, and so she went through some major radiations with that, and then there was a spot elsewhere in her leg, and so this was her last treatment. Hopefully, we'll do another scan and we'll be all clear," Loretta Crocker said.After not being able to visit her at the hospital, Cox's family rushed to hug her, but through a protective barrier."It's great. It's the closest we've been in a while," Cox said."I want the real thing. I know that's what we have to do right now, but I want the real thing," Stephanie Bergeron said.Four generations were excited for their matriarch to be back home."It's all my kids, and their kids and their kids," Cox said.There's nine of us, plus nieces and nephews. We lost my dad a few years ago, so she is very special, and we've been trying not to, we've been trying to social distance but it's hard when you have a big family," Crocker said.As a tightknit family, they've found ways to still keep her in the loop."We had a Zoom Easter. Thats what it was. We had a lot of people on there," Bergeron said."It's just hard not to hug her. it's hard not to be there beside her," Crocker said.Family members said they can't wait to really celebrate once things are back to normal.“When I can, having a big ole’ party,” Cox said.Copyright 2020 WVUE.

Fortunato said that the scope of the session will have to be focused on specific issues, which he said would be on agreement or disagreement on Gov. Jay Inslee’s proclamations such as the “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order, and budget issues.
 “Washington state’s in a crisis mode right now, and I think that the people of Washington state expect their Legislature to go back to work to try to address many of the issues that can’t be addressed via an executive order,” Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, said, mentioning the tax burden on small businesses and the budget shortfall the state is likely to face at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “We have to protect the health of the people, but we also have to be taking steps right now to start bringing manufacturing jobs home from China, start looking at ways to cut our budgets in Olympia, and that really requires the Legislature coming back into session,” Ericksen said, adding he feels it is the responsible thing for lawmakers to take “immediate” action in a special session.
 “Small businesses are shutting their doors; they’re going bankrupt,” Ericksen said. Fortunato said constituents were “screaming that they want to go back to work.”
 “From my point of view, if a business has a safety protocol in place, they run it by the department of health, they get the nod, they get to go back to work,” Fortunato said. He gave the example of essential businesses such as Costco that have taken extensive measures to prevent COVID-19 spread as an example of what other businesses can do when re-opened.
 “They have a protocol in place to be dealing with this issue. Now, why can’t a car dealership do that? Why can’t the other little, local businesses do that?” Fortunato said.
 Regarding economic relief, State Rep. Jesse Young, R-Gig Harbor, said that the $200 million COVID-19 response passed at the end of this year’s regular session “was always meant to be the first start” for a full response.
 Young said that the amount of data available at the present was enough to take action, explaining that the “lag time” from more information will likely do more harm than good. With response funds drying up and a lack of options at the executive level, a special session is necessary to address the existing needs of the state for economic recovery, Young said.
 “To not do that is really shirking our responsibilities. There are people out there hurting,” Young said, adding that apart from economic impacts, those with non-emergency healthcare needs may see their ailments progress into emergency ones due to the restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 response focus.
 Rep. Vicki Kraft, R-Vancouver, said around the end of March she had called on House leaders for a special session due to the apparent impacts of COVID-19 even at that point. She mentioned that the existing legislative response wasn’t enough for PPE needs and testing, adding that from a financial perspective it is unreasonable to wait for the federal government to bail out the state.
 “We have some accountability to our people to try to get them funding quickly within the means that we have,” Kraft said. She said she feels a “tremendous amount of concern” from constituent small businesses on the need to get back to work as soon as possible.
 Kraft said she has heard concerns from some that a special session would open the door to legislation unfavorable to Republicans being pushed through by Democrats, mentioning a state income tax.
 “If they really, seriously are going to try to threaten something like that, then let them, because as a majority they will own that,” Kraft said. “There is not one person, not one business at all — small business especially — in our state, that I think at this time especially would welcome that.”
 “This should be a bipartisan effort. We all have constituents that are hurting on every level,” Kraft said.
 To embrace social distancing guidelines Fortunato said he addressed the possibility of a “virtual” special session, saying he had sent a letter to state Attorney General Bob Ferguson to ask about its constitutionality.
 Young noted that the only mandatory in-person responsibility will be on making a vote, explaining that all the other legislative work could be done remotely.
 “That is typical for most special sessions,” Young said.
 Fortunato said he’s heard frustration from already-established economic recovery task forces, both of industries and lawmakers, that their efforts weren’t being recognized by Inslee.
 “If the governor’s not going to move, how can we as legislators make him move, or move ourselves without him?” Fortunato said, adding that if Inslee himself made the call for a special session, “so be it.”

And so on. There was an osteopath pushing the Chinese lab theory, all directed toward getting you to fork over $450 for “the full story.” There’s the notion sprinkled throughout all these theories that the “mainstream media” is in cahoots with the conspirators, or is just interested in fearmongering. And THAT’s why the truth isn’t really coming out. Blah blah blah.
 As I said, the moment is ripe for this sort of thing. And there’s another force at work: Vladimir Putin. For several years, the Russians have used social media to exploit divisions in American politics and to create confusion.
 The U.S. State Department recently accused Russia of using thousands of social media accounts to spread coronavirus misinformation — including a conspiracy theory that the United States engineered the deadly pandemic.
 An investigation by The New York Times found that Mr. Putin’s agents “have repeatedly planted and spread the idea that viral epidemics — including flu outbreaks, Ebola and now the coronavirus — were sown by American scientists. The disinformers have also sought to undermine faith in the safety of vaccines...”

The notorious, armor-clad, 19th-century Australian bushranger (slang for rural outlaw) Ned Kelly had previously been portrayed onscreen by Mick Jagger ("Ned Kelly," 1970) and by Heath Ledger ("Ned Kelly," 2003). Neither of those films was particularly memorable. Now, here comes British rising star George MacKay, the long-faced lead actor in "1917," to sparklingly bring the character to life in what turns out to be the best, by far, of the three attempts to tell the story.      But let's start with an important point: The beautiful and occasionally brutal film, from Australian director Justin Kurzel, bearing the much longer title "True History of the Kelly Gang," is not a "true history." Based on the Booker Prize-winning 2000 novel by Peter Carey, it, like the book, is a dramatic mix of fact and fiction that tells a fanciful version of the short life of Kelly from the age of 12 (terrifically played by Australian newcomer Orlando Schwerdt) to his final date with destiny 13 years later.      I won't attempt to speculate what's true here and what isn't, because since the film is making no claims to it, it doesn't make any difference. Besides, what's up on the screen is both riveting and entertaining.      Young Ned is first met growing up in a tin shack in a rural town north of Melbourne, the oldest of his siblings, with his mum, Ellen (Essie Davis), and dad, Red, all of them just eking by. Red (Ben Corbett) was a no-count loser who didn't provide for his family. Ellen, much to Red's consternation, earned money by selling her body to various male visitors, including the strapping but dastardly Sgt. O'Neil (Charlie Hunnam).      After Red is removed from the story, Ellen, hoping to give Ned something of a future, works out a deal with an old friend, the smiling, rough and tumble scoundrel Harry Power (Russell Crowe in an extended, scene-stealing cameo), who takes the lad out on the road to teach him the ways of the world, which include keeping a journal "to write your own history" and how to kill people.      Every performance in the film's first 40 minutes is right on the mark (Crowe even gets to sing!). But it's at that point, 10 years later in the story, that MacKay appears, bent backward, his head disconcertingly upside down, his adult Ned Kelly preparing for a bare-knuckle barroom fight, just before heading back home to his mum and grown siblings with hopes of becoming a farmer.      But that hope doesn't materialize, and we know that part is true, that Ned will end up embracing a life of crime, due to a variety of reasons, people and circumstances. It's then that the film starts introducing many more characters. Of note are George King (the amazing Marlon Williams), the much- younger man - and cad - who is about to marry Ned's unbalanced mum, and who is training Ned's brothers to become thieves; the charming but heinous Constable Fitzpatrick (Nicholas Hoult), whose behavior eventually goes unhinged; and Mary Hearn (Thomasin McKenzie), a sweet young woman working at a local brothel.      It would be simplest to say that this is an Australian art house Western, but it's chock full of cinematic and storytelling ingredients that pull it up above that category. It's about bad things happening to good people, and the revenge being sought because it of; it gets into people who are so driven by their goals, they start losing their marbles; and it offers explanations of why the bushrangers who became known as the Kelly Gang started donning dresses and armor before going into action.      One outstanding visual highlight of the film occurs near the end, when the law is closing in on the gang, and the screen erupts in an eerie and bizarrely and beautifully photographed nighttime gunfight. But even that long sequence can't hold a candle to the bigger-than-life, make that gigantic, performance by George MacKay. He's been at his craft for quite a while, and he's now, finally, a star in the making.      "True History of the Kelly Gang" will be available on most digital and cable platforms beginning April 24.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

"Let's find out what they want to do before we do anything on this resolution," councilman Harold Worley said. "Those folks are going to be up in arms if they don't have an opportunity to speak on this resolution before we pass it."
 Councilman Tyler Servant said he has heard from multiple businesses involved in the Harley rallies and there is some disagreement about what to do.
 "They aren't all on the same page yet," he said. "You know it's tough for them to target a date this summer when we don't even know when we're going to be opening up our accommodations."
 Chad Fuller, an attorney with Tom McGrath’s Motorcycle Law Group, said he’s glad council members are willing to step back and hear from the business owners who depend on the rally.
 “This is a bad situation for everybody,” he said. “Let’s be honest, nobody is going to come out winning period with this virus situation. Tourism’s going to take an impact, the American economy’s already taking an impact, and events such as the spring or fall rallies are centered around disposable income. Disposable income is not going to be very easy to come by. … This is where the bikers can actually help out.”
 Fuller said a grassroots group of vendors, bars, restaurants and other businesses worked together to come up with the July 13-19 dates and they hope to hold the event then. They don't plan to make this change permanent — they want to keep the rally in the spring — but they see the July dates as mutually beneficial.
 Organizers know this will likely be a slower event with an economy still recovering from the COVID-19 shutdown and the departure from the normal schedule, but they think the rally could still be a shot in the arm for local businesses.
 “Tourism’s going to be down and the bike rally’s going to be down,” Fuller said. “If you’ve got two things that are 50-50, why not put them together and try to get somewhere towards 100?”

The likely causes behind the dramatically different rates are well-known to public health officials: black residents are more likely to be poor, have difficulty accessing health care and have more pre-existing conditions than those of other races. In addition, they are also more likely to have jobs in the service industry and other sectors that put them at greater risk of infection as the pandemic continues to spread across the state.
 "For those of us who have been sounding this alarm, it's not new," said New Orleans City Councilmember Jay H. Banks, who added that 17 people he knew personally have died of the virus, all but one of them black.
 "What’s new is the illustration of it. What’s new is that people can see it that couldn’t see it before. Now it's slapping people in the face and you still have people trying to ignore it."
 Banks said his one hope is that by putting the disparities into sharp relief, the pandemic could bring about real change in how the state handles race and poverty.
 "The one hope it that it will make people pay attention," he said. "What I’m hoping is this is not all for naught, that there isn’t just lip service and then when a vaccine is created we all go back to business as usual. That’s what I’m hoping we avoid."
 And the devastating impacts the virus continues to have in the black community should put into context the calls for lifting restrictions while the virus still rages. Well-heeled members of the community who have called for returning people to work are not those disproportionately black workers who will be risking infection and death on businesses' front lines, he said.
 "That’s people saying 'I’m OK with putting these other people at risk. I can sacrifice their lives,' " Banks said. "It's not affecting me."

 "We were beyond devastated because when we had the approval we were  already so excited, let all of our employees know," she said.

 "Do the right thing, follow Shake Shack's lead, give the money back. It's not right," she pleaded.
 On Monday, Shake Shack announced it had given back its $10 million PPP funding.
 Frieden said since COVID-19 hit, she's had to change her business model. She now has to deliver fresh juice to customers.
 "Now expanded to offering free groceries, farm baskets and free deliveries," she said.
 Nothing about it has been easy, especially the financial aspect. But one thing she has not resorted to is employee layoffs or furloughs.
 With sales down by 70%, the money had to come from somewhere.
 "It's incredibly difficult. My husband and I have foregone our salaries. Some of our key people have taken a reduction in salaries and still continue to work tirelessly," Frieden said.
 Frieden said that's why it was important to get the $250,000 PPP loan, for her nearly 50 employees at five Austin area stores.
 Now, her application is waiting for hopefully a second round of PPP.
