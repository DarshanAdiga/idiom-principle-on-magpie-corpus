It was Theodore Roosevelt who famously encouraged Americans to not be afraid to enter “the arena” of their time. When his crew’s well being was at stake, Captain Crozier was not afraid to enter the arena. He did not cower in fear of ambitious, heartless leaders. He acted at the time in what he felt was the best way he could for his crew. As the good skipper humbly pointed out the United States is not at war; it’s not necessary to keep steaming full speed ahead as you slide your dead off the fantail. He had the courage to decide he wasn't going to sacrifice any more of his crew to belligerently show the flag in the South China Sea.

If I only have five minutes, I close my eyes and try to relax my bod. I can’t necessarily take a nap in five minutes, but I try to calm down and put everything away and put ocean sounds on my phone. If I have more time for myself, I’ll play Mario Party on my DS or play with my dog or watch a movie. Lately, I’ve been watching old movies like _Gone With The Wind_ , _Casablanca_ and _My Fair Lady_. I recently discovered these movies in quarantine. My mom introduced them to me.

Let’s consider the 2020 leadership issue on board the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt in the light of these WWII Navy movies. The story of the Theodore Roosevelt represents no less a human drama with lessons on leadership than the two classic WWII dramas mentioned above. In fact, it’s not hard to imagine Captain Brett Crozier as the protagonist of a future Navy film full of conflict, courage, cowardice and moral ambiguity -- even comedy and tragedy. My choice to write and direct such a film would be Adam McCay, director of the caustically funny and entertaining Dick Cheney tragicomedy, _Vice._ Obtaining Navy support for such a film from today's Navy leadership- the use of one of their aircraft carriers! -- would be a bit of a challenge. But can we now CGI aircraft carriers? _

From the standpoint of holding police accountable, he said: "I think there's been widespread disappointment that with her as an African-American, the first who has been in that seat, that that has not happened to the degree that people think that it should have,"
 Lacey said Floyd's death has forced her to consider dusting off an idea she shelved to remove police departments from investigating their own officers in shootings, though she knows that will not be popular with chiefs.
 Lacey said she's tried to have discussions with Black Lives Matter, but the members want to meet in larger forums, where she has been heckled and shouted down.
 Protesters even showed up at her doorstep before dawn the day before the March primary, prompting Lacey's husband to pull a gun on Abdullah and threaten to shoot. The incident is under investigation by the state attorney general.
 Black Lives Matter does not endorse candidates and Abdullah won't say she will support Gascon.
 "We can't say that because we're going to have to protest him too, I'm sure," Abdullah said. "I just know that it's impossible to be worse than Lacey."

Considering the territory he covered every day in the city, I thought he would be the perfect person to operate a rolling vending cart to sell The Evening Capital.
 I caught him on the street one day, brought him into my office on the second floor, and explained how I thought he could make good money in his travels selling the paper. I remember him telling me: “Where the girls at” … and “Know what I do with girls? I put them on my back.” I was not sure what that meant, but knowing his reputation as a good guy, I was willing to take a chance.
 Long story short, Carlester worked for us one day. At the end of the day, when he reported back, he had sold less than five newspapers. You see, he never broke stride to sell a newspaper. He just kept on trucking.
 His memory motors on.

We're back in business! Well, kind of. Although the library buildings continue to be closed to the public, Westbank and Laura's libraries began reserve and pickup service on June 2. This means that for three hours a day (1-4 p.m. every day except Sundays), patrons can swing by either library location to pick up materials they've reserved online. At Westbank, folks can pick up their items from the covered front porch. At Laura's, they can come to the drive-thru window.
   
 Public Service Manager Kara Hoholik said there was a big rush the first week on books and movies patrons had waited months to read or watch, but "since then, our numbers have more or less gotten more manageable." At Laura's Library, the three-hour pickup window averages about 40 patrons a day, while at Westbank Library about 55 to 60 patrons stop by the front porch each day to pick up their reserved materials. Two weeks into reserve and pickup service, over 5,000 reserves had already been placed.
   
 Library Director Mary Jo Finch reminded patrons who are eager for more library materials that even though they can only reserve 10 items at a time, they can check out much more than this. "Once you have been contacted that your reserves are ready for pick up, you can go in and reserve your next batch. A family membership allows 50 items out at a time."
   
 Finch feels grateful for patrons who remember to wear masks when coming to the library. "We really appreciate that people are wearing their masks when they come to pick up their items, in the drive-thru at Laura's or on our front porch at Westbank. We really need our staff to stay healthy so we can continue to offer library services like this."
   
 When librarians aren't at the drive-thru or on the front porch interacting with patrons, they are chugging away behind the scenes. "All of us are working pretty much the whole day at circulation, checking in, shelving, and handling reserves," Hoholik said. "I definitely get a good workout on my onsite days. It's helping me appreciate our volunteers even more."
   
 Normally, the libraries have around 135 volunteers to help them with tasks such as checking books in and out, shelving items, pulling reserved materials and covering new books. However, since the pandemic began, the libraries have asked their volunteers to stay home and stay safe.
   
 As Finch said, "Successful reopening in a pandemic means really limiting your staff's exposure as much as you can. So we are working in small teams and without our volunteers, and, my, are we missing our volunteers. They do so much to keep the library running smoothly, covering new materials that come in and checking in and shelving thousands of materials each week. It's a lot of work, and it is keeping us running."
   
 Other librarians agree. "There has not been a single day when I have not missed our volunteers," Volunteer Coordinator Manisha Mehta said. "I end up being on my feet all day, and on average I walk about three miles. No complaints. This keeps me physically fit, and I don't get bored."
   
 To cover the three-hour pickup window outside, staff members take 30-minute shifts on Westbank's front porch. "Some days are really hot and humid," Mehta said, "but the pedestal fan helps. It is nice since sometimes our volunteers stop by, and we get a few minutes to chit chat."
   
 In addition to reserving library materials like books and movies, patrons can also register for a summer kit for their family. The summer kits contain a free copy of the community read, "James and the Giant Peach" by Roald Dahl. They also include a "weird summer" journal for each member of the family, craft supplies, peach recipes and more. The idea for the journal was prompted by the Austin History Center, which is currently sponsoring a pandemic journaling project to record people's experiences during this unusual time.
   
 The summer kits have been a huge hit, with over 350 families (totaling over 1,500 people) registering online.
   
 Stephanie Kelley, a mother of three, told the library, "We really appreciated the summer kit. Things have been hard for the kids the past couple of months, and it was a treat for them to get the kit at the drive-thru. They deserve a treat right now. When we got home, the kids were busy for at least an hour."
   
 Another family recently wrote Westbank a thank you email, expressing gratitude that the library's programs and services are providing a sense of normalcy right now. This may be a very "weird summer," but the library is doing what it can to keep it fun and continue connecting with the community.

The Theodore Roosevelt’s early March five-day, port-of-call visit to the Vietnam city of Da Nang was where its sailors picked up the virus that, then, swept through the huge ship’s close quarters. It was not the Vietnamese's fault; shit happens. The leadership's final decision makes it clear the huge warship’s 21st century gunboat-diplomacy mission in the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea trumped all concern for the lives and safety of the sailors on board. In the spirit of the ship's namesake -- Big Stick Teddy Roosevelt, the nation's beloved original imperialist -- the leadership's top priority is to show the flag to scare the Chinese, the health and welfare of our sons and daughters in uniform be damned. Maybe Captain Crozier should have slipped his dead crew members off the fantail wrapped in Old Glory -- like in the WWII war movies.
