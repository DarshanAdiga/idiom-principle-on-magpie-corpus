Financial market conditions continued to improve amid the new monetary policy decisions taken at end-May. Key interbank money market rates consolidated their decline and subsequently their lower levels, and yields on government securities extended their downward course, given the significant volume of liquidity provided by the NBR via bilateral repo operations and purchases of leu-denominated government securities on the secondary market, in the context of a sizeable liquidity deficit on the money market; the stock of repo operations posted a daily average of lei 4.8 billion June through July 2020 and the volume of government securities purchased by the central bank reached a similar figure, i.e. nearly lei 4.8 billion, at end-July. In turn, the average lending rate on new business followed a clear-cut downtrend in 2020 Q2, while the average remuneration of new time deposits fell only slightly, with the related spread narrowing considerably.

La agenda oficial de los Reyes, intercalada en sus vacaciones mallorquinas, arrancara el lunes y todo parece indicar que sera este dia cuando visitaran Petra, concretamente la casa solariega y el museo dedicado a san Junipero Serra. Nadie lo certifica, pero se trabaja sobre esta prevision.   Tummy Bestard, la persona que esta al frente de estos espacios, asegura que "no hay nada confirmado" y que "todo esta en el aire". Aun asi, por si acaso se confirmara la visita, estos dias se han estado ultimando algunos detalles para que todo este a punto de revista para los reyes. Tal y como comentaba Bestard, se han pintado algunas paredes, limpiado todo a fondo y repuesto algunas bombillas que no funcionaban. "Lo tipico, tampoco hemos hecho obra", apunta.
 Movimientos de limpieza tambien entre los vecinos. Margalida Mas es una petrera de la calle Barracar en la que se conserva la casa en la que paso su infancia el evangelizador de California y el museo dedicado a su obra. Se prepara, junto a otros residentes, para que este todo listo para recibir la visita de los Reyes. "Ha pasado el alcalde y nos ha dicho si lo tendriamos curioso pero no hacia falta que nos lo dijera porque ya estabamos en marcha", explica Margalida, que al igual que algunos de sus vecinos adecentaba las macetas que adornan la calle por la que el lunes esta previsto que trascurran don Felipe, doña Letizia y sus dos hijas. "Hay una buena expectacion", asegura esta petrera. Mientras, en el interior proximo del convento de Sant Bernardi, en el que se formo inicialmente Junipero, los trabajos son mas discretos. Los frailes franciscanos mexicanos que ahora residen en el se caracterizan por mantener la estetica, el significado liturgico y la ornamentacion del lugar. Si Felipe VI incluye el templo en su recorrido, no les pillara desprevenidos.
 Por su parte, el alcalde Salvador Femenias esta a la espera de que se cierre la hora exacta de la visita, algo que seguramente se sabra este sabado pero de momento Petra se prepara para que el pueblo quede listo para abrir sus puertas a los Reyes. El hecho es que la brigada municipal se ha puesto a trabajar con todos sus efectivos en los lugares juniperianos para dejar calles y edificios de la parte mas antigua del pueblo a punto de paseo real. Los rumores y comentarios se van incrementado a medida que avanzan los dias. Todo son cabalas y especulaciones sobre una visita estival de los Reyes a Petra que ya se tiene por segura, pero a la que falta concrecion, horario y detalle. Se ha programado como respaldo a la figura de Junipero Serra, despues de los ataques que ha recibido su figura -sus esculturas- en distintas partes del mundo. El acto de Petra puede ser tambien la primera aparicion publica, fuera de La Zarzuela, de Felipe VI, despues de que su padre hiciera publico su cambio de residencia fuera de España. El ahora rey emerito, la reina Sofia y las infantas Cristina y Elena ya estuvieron en el convento franciscano de Petra el 11 de octubre de 1984, con motivo del bicentenario del nacimiento de Junipero Serra. Aquel dia, el principe Felipe, el monarca actual, fue el unico miembro de la Familia Real que no estuvo presente en el acto petrer.
 La casa del misionero esta regentada por una fundacion ad hoc y el museo por la Asociacion de Amigos de Fray Junipero Serra. Esta ultima entidad mide sus exitos y objetivos por el rango de los vinculos institucionales que logra establecer. Por eso las paredes del museo estan forradas de placas conmemorativas de autoridades y visitantes ilustres. La apertura normalizada de las instalaciones y la difusion regular del legado juniperiano se mantienen en un plano muy inferior.
 Lograr la presencia de Felipe VI y Letizia en Petra era uno de los grandes objetivos de la asociacion. Se intento con insistencia su inclusion en la visita oficial de los reyes a Balears el pasado mes de junio. Se logra ahora. Sin embargo, el hecho ha pillado a los anfitriones con el pie cambiado.   Las instalaciones del museo han permanecido en estado de semiabandono durante los ultimos meses. La maleza se ha apoderado de los jardines y la humedad de las paredes, por eso, ha sido necesario practicar la operacion de limpieza y rehabilitacion general que se esta llevando a cabo.

The new scenario reconfirms the expected trajectory of the annual inflation rate highlighted in the previous forecast, with a slightly downward revision over the near-term horizon. Specifically, the annual inflation rate is anticipated to increase slightly in July as well, and thereafter to remain relatively stable in the upper half of the variation band of the target until the end of this year, before declining and hovering moderately around the mid- point of the target amid the lagged action of disinflationary effects from the aggregate demand deficit; this is expected to open up markedly in 2020 Q2, but then to narrow gradually and somewhat faster than in the previous forecast. The uncertainty surrounding the new macroeconomic projections continues to be extremely elevated in the current environment, triggering two-way risks to the inflation outlook over the projection horizon. Their major source remains, at least in the short run, the coronavirus pandemic – which has resurged of late – and the associated containment measures that weigh on the speed and path of economic recovery, the government’s support programmes and the NBR’s monetary policy measures notwithstanding.

Thus, we are facing a good science fiction graphic adventure, which is committed to a three-dimensional development with direct control. This decision is striking after the more than irregular result of this approach in both Broken Sword 3 and 4, even more considering that Revolution returned to the classic development with pointer and two-dimensional for the fantastic Broken Sword 5, much better and more enjoyable than the previous two. Therefore, the use of this approach instead of one similar to that of the 1994 classic is surprising, but the truth is that this time the study has saved the ballot very well in this regard, and the problems that the adventure. Faced with a title that is more than correct and very entertaining, this is very far both in terms of puzzles and the development of the story and characters that its predecessor boasted. Beneath a Steel Sky is a classic and one of the best exponents of the graphic adventure genre, which still retains all its charm today, and we remind you that it is completely free in GOG in case you have not played it. This continuation is a very brave and honest bet, which seeks to please a wide spectrum of players, who lags somewhat behind the best options available today in the genre, but still manages to offer an attractive and enjoyable title.

The future looks bright for Coach Amy Janutolo and the Lady Tiger golf team. With nearly each member just picking up the game within the last two years, this team is ready to compete for the foreseeable future. “This season we have 11 players,” says coach Janutolo. “I’m so glad that each year we have more girls interested in the game of golf. Our varsity team is deemed to be a top contender for region this year. COVID-19 really put us behind on practicing, but a lot of our girls continued to work, practice, and even compete on their own.”
 Coach Janutolo had plenty of high praise for her varsity squad, as they’ve improved in leaps and bounds over the past year. Their growth as golfers continues to show that Big Hickory is a talent producer. “Elivia Marcum has without a doubt put in the most time and work to improve her game,” said Janutolo. “You can see the most growth in her short game. She’s competed in several tournaments already this year, and our course staff always comments that she practices every single day.” “Avery Janutolo slowed down this spring due to COVID-19, but is now back in the grind,” says Janutolo. “As a very small in stature incoming freshman, people are often surprised at the power in Avery’s swing.”
 Increased practice time has helped Taylor Messer, Hallie Hooker, Adyson Hooker, and Lily Smith says Janutolo. “Taylor is showing more dedication to golf this year. She’s increased her practice time and continues to focus on improving. She has become more consistent in her good shots. Taylor’s long drives off the tee have always impressed us. I expect Taylor’s score to be a bigger contribution to team wins this season.”
 “Hallie Hooker puts a lot of practice time in,” said Janutolo. “She showed improvement as last season progressed and we expect that same improvement this year from her. Adyson Hooker grew in all aspects of golf last season. By season’s end she was showing more consistency and strength in her swing.”
 The team themselves had plenty to say as well, as the kids are simply excited to be back competing and striving to complete their goals. Elivia Marcum is beyond excited for the season. “I am so excited about this upcoming season,” says Marcum. “I have played in several tournaments throughout the summer to try and improve my game. Hopefully this will help me be a better player this upcoming season and help put us in position to win the region as a team.”
 Avery Janutolo was ecstatic to finally be competing as a high school athlete, while chasing her one goal of winning a region title. “I’m excited that this season I’m finally competing as an actual high school student,” said Janutolo. “I didn’t get to practice or play much this spring because of Covid-19. One thing I did get to do was play in the Marion Miley Invitational. It was awesome because I actually got to compete with some college players that I look up to and admire. I even got to play with my favorite University of Kentucky player, Ryan Bender. My goal is for our team to win region this year.”
 COVID-19 has put a damper on most things, but Taylor Messer feels the team will be right on track for a great season. “I think the corona season has been a hinderance to our team due to the lack of practice that we never received,” said Messer. “However, I feel that we are on the right track to getting where we need to be. Sure, it may be different, but I would rather social distance and golf than to do away with the whole season. I love my team and I’m looking forward to a great season this year.”
 Lastly, Hallie Hooker is simply looking ahead as she’s anxious to join her teammates. “Although I’ve enjoyed spending time at home with my family during this pandemic, I’ve definitely missed being out on the golf course with my teammates,” said Hooker. “I can’t wait to see what the season has in store for us. I know it will look a little different, but I expect it to be one of the best.”
