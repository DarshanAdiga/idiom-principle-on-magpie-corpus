Parish President Gordy Dove announced during the Terrebonne Parish Council meeting Wednesday that he intends to require the wearing of face masks in public buildings in the parish.
   
 Next week, Dove said, the parish expects to receive 195,000 masks, and that the timing of the order depends on getting them in.
   
 "If we can distribute enough masks out there, I plan on making it mandatory, any public building you have to wear a mask," Dove said. "But first we have to make sure we have enough masks."
   
 Dove said he intends to pass his "Common Sense Mask Mandate" in about 2 weeks - contingent on distributing enough masks. He said it will apply to restaurants and retail outlets, but not to other normal functions. With businesses expected to open back up on May 15, in response to Governor John Bel Edwards' executive order, Dove said his concern was that he feared a sudden spike in cases would cause a return to quarantine measures.
   
 "My fear is that we go back to normal, and then we spike, and then we have to start putting everything back, so why not be careful at the beginning," said Dove. "I know some people believe that they shouldn't have to wear a mask, but it's not for them as much as for the neighbor."
   
 According to Dove, 64,000 masks have already been distributed, and he hopes that these 195,000 will give all 115,000 parish residents access to a mask. He said that with masks becoming more common, stores will carry them more regularly.
   
 The price of masks has fallen since the Parish began purchasing them, said Dove, but he expects the cost to the parish for the purchases to be entirely recouped. Originally his administration stocked up at $3.68 per mask, but the price has dropped to $0.74. To date, $70,000 has been spent on the masks, and the incoming masks will cost another $100,000. That price is expected to drop to $55,000 after FEMA reimburses the Parish, and with the Governor distributing $700,000,000 to the 64 parishes, Dove said he intends to use that money to cover the costs.
   
 "The masks will be free at the end of the day," he said.
   
 Some council members held reservations about potential overreach, and feared infringing on personal liberty. John Amedee was the first to question the need for such action.
   
 "At some point you have to be real and start easing off some of the more stricter mandates," he said.
   
 At first, the response to the virus was necessary because of the lack of information, Amedee said, but because the number of cases is in decline restrictions should begin to be removed.
   
 "It was necessary to an unknown - when you don't know what it is, you throw everything at it," he said. "And then you start peeling those away as you start to gain more knowledge of it."
   
 Mandates of this nature should be top-down, said Domangue, lest Terrebonne Parish start down a slippery slope. People have a right to self-determination, she said, and wearing a mask should be a personal choice.
   
 "I understand that this is kind of a moving target and it's been a moving target the whole time, and things are going to be constantly changing and evolving," Domangue said. "I just think us as a local government need to pump the breaks a little bit, and wait it out and see what's going to happen with the rest of the nation, and what's going to happen with the CDC, because right now it's just a recommendation by the CDC, it's not a mandate."
   
 Council member Gerald Michel was strongly behind the idea, arguing that it is not a right if it puts other's safety in jeopardy.
   
 "I totally disagree with what you are saying there. We don't have a right to go 80 mph through a subdivision because it jeopardizes others," Michel said. "We shouldn't have a right not to wear a mask for as long as it jeopardizes others."
   
 He argued that it was unnecessary to wait for outside mandates, that these were local issues.
   
 "We have to mandate that people have to wear masks, to whatever degree we possibly can, and we don't need to wait for the federal government or the state government," Michel said.
   
 Council member Daniel Babin, who has recovered from COVID-19, said the public needed to take the illness seriously. Unsure of the legal authority to mandate the wearing of masks, he said if the council had the authority, they should pass the rule.
   
 "I am for legally enforcing it, if we have that authority," Babin said. "The problem is, until we reach that number of giving away masks to the total number of people in Terrebonne Parish, it's hard to do something like that, because then some people can say, 'well I didn't get a mask.'
   
 "Well, if you have 110,000 people and you gave away 110,000 masks, that doesn't mean each one of them got it, but they had the opportunity to get it," said Babin.
   
 He said that while businesses may differ on whether they chose to bar customers who are unwilling to wear masks, officials could go to those who chose not to and request that they get on board.
   
 The pandemic has changed everyday life, said Babin.
   
 "This is a new time, we're going to have a new normal from here on out, and we need to learn to adapt to that," he said.

Louisiana's oil and gas industry needs substantial "life support" relief now or faces long-term problems if state leaders don't offer more help, industry advocates argue.
   
 Oil prices have ticked up slowly, closing at about $18.50 on Thursday, but they remain dangerously low for an industry challenged by high supply from production by Russia and Saudi Arabia and low demand during the coronavirus epidemic.
   
 As lawmakers return to Baton Rouge for the legislative session Monday, the industry still urges Louisiana leaders to suspend severance taxes and to provide relief from coastal lawsuits to help offset the financial crisis producers face, said Louisiana Oil and Gas Association President Gifford Briggs.
   
 In a meeting with The Courier and Daily Comet and The Lafayette Daily Advertiser, Briggs and other industry advocates said they are eager to work with Gov. John Bel Edwards and lawmakers to find a solution. Edwards has said it's up to the Legislature to make any changes to the state's severance tax, although he did authorize delayed collections to help oil and gas interests.
   
 Briggs said he couldn't estimate how many industry jobs would be impacted with relief from severance tax payments.
   
 "Anything we can do to continue to keep wells flowing in this state for as long as possible will help people stay at work and will keep revenues flowing throughout our communities," Briggs said.
   
 The oil and gas industry, both in Louisiana and across the nation, has been ravaged by an international trading war and massive decreases in demand. A battle between Saudi Arabia and Russia added millions of barrels to the market and the COVID-19 crisis drastically lowered global oil and gas usage, resulting in a historic glut of oil.
   
 The crisis came to a head last week when oil prices plunged below zero, falling to about -$37 per barrel.
   
 LOGA conducted a survey of Louisiana oil and gas producers to field possible solutions and determine the depth of the crisis. Producers said they needed oil prices to hit around $37 a barrel to break even and that, without improvement or relief, the industry could see widespread layoffs.
   
 Beta Land Services Owner Bryan Hanks said in the weeks since the original survey, oil producers have continued to be hit hard and have faced tough decisions.
   
 He said his land service company had between 120 and 130 workers at the end of 2019. Now, it's between 40 and 50. He said landmen are typically some of the first to get hit by layoffs.
   
 Hanks said one of the biggest concerns is that there are few projects being planned for after the crisis ends.
   
 "We continue to work on projects that are ongoing, but what we don't see, which is the scary part, are projects being lined up after this," Hanks said. "There's no talk of what's going to go on next."
   
 Briggs and other oil and gas industry advocates have been vocal in pushing for relief at the local, state and federal levels. Briggs said before the crisis hit, the industry was already pushing for a reduction in the state severance tax and relief from coastal lawsuits.
   
 But now, the industry is in need of "life support measures," he said. Whereas before the industry wanted changes like reductions in the severance tax, now they are seeking a suspension in the tax while oil is below a certain price point.
   
 "We certainly weren't talking about suspending severance taxes at the level that we're talking about now," Briggs said. "It is absolutely critical that every company have access to as much capital as possible, and so infusing them with the severance tax incentive and finally moving past some of these coastal lawsuits where important dollars that are being spent on defense lawyers could be used to help make payroll is more critical right now than ever before."
   
 The severance tax is a state tax put in place on any natural resource produced in the state. The majority of the revenue comes from oil and gas, and the industry has long been critical of the tax rate.
   
 The coastal lawsuits have also been a longstanding point of contention with the industry. The lawsuits target oil and gas companies and allege they contributed to the state's land loss problem, but critics of the lawsuits argue they've become cookie cutter and depress one of the state's most important industries.
   
 Hanks, who has worked with land services in 39 states, said the coastal lawsuits have led to the state developing a reputation for its litigious climate. He said Louisiana has some of the best resources in the nation, but the legal issues make it difficult for companies to operate in the state.
   
 He said Texas has about 200,000 active wells compared to Louisiana's 17,000.
   
 "We have the same, if not better, rock," Hanks said. "Do we really think there's that much disparity between our two states?"
   
 As the state -- and the nationwide oil and gas industry -- begin to recover, Louisiana will have to make changes to make itself more attractive to companies.
   
 Republican state Sen. Bob Hensgens of Abbeville, who has authored a bill to address the lawsuits, said Louisiana is currently one of the least appealing options for oil and gas companies.
   
 "When it starts coming back, and we all wait for that day, we know it's not going to rush open, we want to be attractive enough that they'll come to us first," Hensgens said.
   
 Hensgens' legislation, Senate Bill 359, would make the Louisiana Coastal Zone Management Program more streamlined and ensure the state has the sole authority to proceed with these lawsuits.
   
 The current law gives district attorneys and local governments the authority to bring legal orders for issues of state concern. The bill would only allow state officials to act on state concerns, and local officials could act on local concerns, according to the bill text.
   
 LOGA also is supporting House Bill 506 by Rep. Phillip DeVillier, R-Eunice, which would provide for severance tax relief. Because a portion of the severance tax revenue goes to local governments, Briggs said, it's important to balance the needs of the industry and local government finances.
   
 Briggs said that balance will be difficult to strike, especially because of the interrupted session. He mentioned reducing the tax by 80% as a possibility, leaving only the 20% that goes to local governments, though there is no guarantee all the remaining revenue would go to local entities.
   
 "They wouldn't necessarily automatically get that 20%, so we're going to have to figure out a legislative solution through the appropriations bill or some other mechanism to make it clear that that 20% is there to be shared with local government to make them as whole as they would be assuming there was no decrease," Briggs said.
   
 In addition to the severance tax relief and the coastal lawsuits, the industry is looking for local changes in the form of property tax assessments and federal changes like royalty relief.
   
 On the federal side, the industry is hoping to get some assistance in future stimulus packages. The original Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act included money for the federal government to buy oil to fill the strategic petroleum reserve, though that money did not make it in the final version that passed.
   
 Louisiana's congressional delegation has been vocal in advocating for federal relief, writing numerous letters asking President Donald Trump to address the royalty payments.
   
 State and local governments have received some funding from the federal government, though Hensgens said it came with "handcuffs." Lawmakers are hopeful they'll gain some flexibility in how to use the funding.
   
 "From a standpoint of direct impact to oil and gas... I haven't seen anything concrete," said state Rep. Jean-Paul Coussan, a Lafayette Republican and the chair of the House Natural Resources and Environment Committee.

"I think I write the way I do because of a vitamin deficiency. I don't eat any vegetables. I just eat meat and potatoes. I think I'm trying to make up in my songwriting what I lack in vitamins." - John Prine      If he didn't already know what a spring tonic is, John Prine was the kind of person who would have been disappointed to learn it isn't an alcoholic drink. But I bet he knew. With roots in western Kentucky, he was country to the bone.      A spring tonic is a mix of wild plant parts traditionally gathered at the end of winter in many rural parts of America. Back in the day, folk survived winter on a Prine-style diet of rations that had dwindled to the likes of flour, bacon, potatoes and sugar. After months indoors on a white, greasy diet, the first hunt of the year for green, vitamin-rich plants was an awakening for the mind, body and belly.      I don't know that Prine went foraging for wild plants in his spare time, but even if he didn't long for chlorophyll, he acknowledged vegetables as a path to salvation. His advice to "plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches, and try to find Jesus on your own" remains a three-line anthem to generations of back-to-the-landers.      Here in our first post-Prine spring we are largely stuck at home, or close to it, and there may not be a better time to forage the neighborhood for your own local spring tonic. I'm going to tell you how to serve it in the form of a gathered plant pesto. If you told him it was Weed Pesto, as I call it, the man with the twinkle in his songs might have used it.      Wild & edible   Every region will have its own list of edible, nutritious, ideally palatable spring greens. And there are some plants that are available nearly everywhere, like dandelion, lambsquarters, chickweed, purslane, dock, sorrel, cattails, nettles, watercress, asparagus and fiddlehead ferns. Even Johnny jump ups, also called violas, are edible, with a fresh, minty taste.      Each of these plants will have its own specifics for harvesting and cooking. Nettles, which have a fragrant, almost fishy taste, require scissors and a bag, and perhaps gloves, and should always be eaten cooked or blended unless you have the tongue of a bear. Dandelions, which are bitter as a good IPA beer, can be eaten raw or cooked; every single inch, from root to flower. Ditto for chickweed, which tastes a bit like parsley and licorice.      Many of the same principles for collecting wild plants also apply in your backyard. Every would-be forager must assess the grounds at their disposal and strategize accordingly.      The mentality involved in foraging is one to which any food shopper can relate. We go to the supermarket in search of one grocery item, but it's sold out and we have to improvise, and come home with another.      But the wild food we gather has not been vetted for edibility like grocery store food. Before you put anything in your mouth, find a trusted reference on the edible plants of your area. Search any piece of land that is legally available and clean of pesticides and other chemical and yellow animal fluids. Always do your harvesting away from any trail, and don't ever wipe out a location, so the patch can recover. And if you are lucky enough to have a backyard, explore every square inch.      How to enjoy   The easiest way to enjoy these plants might be in a saute pan, a handful of spring greens at a time, with salt, onions and olive oil. If you have a decent blender, this pesto recipe is thick with flavor, fat and chlorophyll. Toss it onto hot noodles. Scramble it into eggs or migas. Or just eat it off the spoon.      Pesto is one of the tastier ways to consume any green plant, especially those with strong flavors. It can incorporate essentially anything green, though some leaves, and combinations of leaves, will taste better than others. If not good enough, add more nuts, garlic, oil and cheese.      Our pesto will have a base of dandelion, since they are literally everywhere. In today's version I add nettles, as they are prolific right now where I live, and make a thick, aromatic pesto. But you could substitute any number of wild greens or weeds, like lambsquarter, watercress or chickweed, or a mixture of whatever you think will go well together. If these flavors are too strong, you could also substitute parsley or basil in place of some of the wild stuff.      Weed Pesto   8 servings   • 2 tablespoons chopped garlic   • 1 teaspoon salt   • 1 cup olive oil   • 1/2 cup almonds or pine nuts   • ½ cup grated parmesan or romano cheese   • Zest of a lemon, and 2 tablespoons of juice   • 4 cups chopped dandelion greens, loosely packed, spotlessly clean   • 5 three-inch nettle tips (or other greens)      Add the garlic, salt, oil, nuts, cheese, lemon juice and zest to the blender and turn them into a thin, homogenous solution. Carefully add the greens to the pesto, a few at a time, until they too are part of the smooth paste.   Serve tossed on piping hot noodles, which will cook the garlic just a tad. I like to stir in some sauteed greens, too.      Refrigerate the leftovers.

Daniel James Bosse, of Moscow, died Tuesday, April 28, 2020, at Gritman Medical Center in Moscow, after a courageous 15-year battle with Parkinson’s disease. He was 78.
 Dan was born April 19, 1942, in Moscow, to parents Richard and Martha (Breeden) Bosse. They moved to Spokane when Dan was a year old, where he grew up and attended several Catholic schools and Gonzaga Preparatory High School, until the family moved back to Moscow just before Dan’s senior year. He graduated from Moscow High School in 1960. Dan met his wife, Janice (Peterson) Bosse, while Dan’s sister, Jan, was dating Janice’s brother, Gary. The two were married at St. Mary’s Catholic Church on May 5, 1962.
 Dan began working for the U.S. Post Office shortly after high school, starting as a substitute mail clerk-carrier. He had a long, successful career with the post office and advanced to become Moscow’s first nonpolitical appointed postmaster. He served as postmaster for 16 years and continues to hold the title of Moscow’s longest serving postmaster. He retired from the post office in 1998 after a 37-year career. He began a second career testing various mail sorting systems in major cities across the United States, with Jan often traveling with him, until his retirement in 2011.
 Dan was very involved in his community and was the leader in nearly every organization he joined. He was actively involved in many causes and organizations, including the AARP Latah Chapter, National Association of Active and Retired Federal Employees, National Association of Postmasters of the United States, and Kihei Akahi Timeshare Owners’ Association Board of Directors. He was a member of local chapters of the Loyal Order of Moose, the Elks Lodge and Kiwanis Club, and was once honored as the Kiwanian of the Year. He was a strong supporter of St. Mary’s Catholic school and a member of the St. Mary’s School Board, where he served as president, started the annual Christmas tree sale and was the auctioneer for its inaugural auction. He was a longtime member of the Knights of Columbus and served as grand knight and faithful navigator. Throughout his life, he was known for his dedication and determination, and was never one to hesitate in sharing his opinion.
 Dan’s favorite interests included golfing, traveling, reading, and woodworking, and he was an avid University of Idaho Vandal fan. Dan and Janice enjoyed many summers boating and cruising on Lake Coeur d’Alene with their children and grandchildren. They often spent winter months in Maui, where they enjoyed lounging on the beaches, hiking the mountains and volcanoes, and could enjoy more golf.
 Dan was proud of his achievements and considered his greatest accomplishments to be his 58-year marriage and active involvement with their children as they matured into successful adults.
 Dan is survived by his wife, Janice, and their four children, Julie (Lee) Muller, of Spokane, Jerry (Laura Granato) Bosse, of McLean, Va., Jacqueline (Luke) Newcomb, of Houston, and Jami (Bryant) Gilbertson, of Falls Church, Va. He is also survived by his sisters, Jan Peterson, of Pullman, and Sharon Fletcher, of Spokane; and his brothers, Mike Bosse, of Walla Walla, and Rick (Nancy) Bosse, of Moscow. Dan and Janice have eight grandchildren, Leann (Jason) Boekel, Parker Newcomb, Cami (Bobby) Prochaska, Brooke (Michael) Nutter, Rylee Bosse, Brieana Gilbertson, Bryce Gilbertson and Dominic Granato. They have seven great-grandchildren, Neil and McKenzilee Boekel, Chase and Khloe Prochaska, Christopher and Reagan Nutter and Stanley Newcomb.
 He was preceded in death by an infant son, Douglas; and his parents.
 Dan will be laid to rest at the Moscow Cemetery. A memorial Mass will be celebrated at a later date.
 In lieu of flowers, the family asks donations be made to St. Mary’s School Foundation, P.O. Box 8485, Moscow, ID 83843.
 Arrangements have been entrusted to Short's Funeral Chapel of Moscow. Viewing is available between 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. today, and condolences may be left at www.shortsfuneralchapel.com.

During my training phase, I was injured and so I started the job with my right leg in a Velcro cast. Then we were informed that as new employees, we would be starting on the locked wards without keys as it would take time to have them made. I would have to depend on other staff to get me off and on the wards. This was potentially dangerous especially when I found myself, a young woman in my twenties, on a locked men’s ward with a bum leg, no key and a fight broke out; my music therapy guitar used by a patient as a weapon to hit another patient. Soon after, I found out I was pregnant which was reason enough to move on to a different job.
 When a job situation challenges my safety or my values, the cost is too high. My journey has taught me to choose jobs that bring joy. Listening to what fits me and fills me is now my priority. If a vocation feels like a fight, it’s not right.

BOISE — Three northern Idaho residents have filed a federal lawsuit challenging statewide restrictions ordered by Gov. Brad Little because of the coronavirus, saying it violates their religious freedoms.
 Two religious leaders and a churchgoer filed the lawsuit Thursday against Little and Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen.
 The lawsuit targets Little’s stay-at-home order as unconstitutional and specifically cites restrictions on religious gatherings. That order expired Thursday and was replaced by one that allows church gatherings, but still requires social distancing.
 But attorneys said Friday the remaining restrictions on churches remain unconstitutional and they plan to request a temporary restraining order to have them lifted.
 They also said they’re concerned Little could reinstate the stay-at-home order should Idaho see a spike in infections and deaths because of the virus.
 “To dictate that we may not worship by gathering together means we actually can’t worship,” said Nathan MacPherson, an attorney who filed the lawsuit and who also lives in northern Idaho.
 He said it wasn’t exactly clear how the lawsuit might affect other types of gatherings, such as in movie theaters. He said the lawsuit was filed specifically for religious gatherings.
 Scott Graf, spokesman for Attorney General Lawrence Wasden, said his office had no comment.
 Wasden has previously said Little’s stay-at-home order to limit the spread of the coronavirus is legal and clearly defined by law. In a release, he also said that both the director of the Department of Health and Welfare and local public health districts have authority to issue quarantine and isolation orders.
 Josh Jones, Michael Gulotta and Scott Herndon filed the lawsuit. Jones is a pastor at Laclede Community Church in Laclede. Gulotta is a pastor at the Christian Reformed Church in Grangeville. Herndon is a Sagle resident who attends church. Herndon in 2018 ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for a state Senate seat.
 MacPherson said worshipers will likely respect social distancing requirements as a matter of safety, but that the government shouldn’t be allowed to dictate such requirements to religious groups. He also took issue with churches not being considered essential under Little’s stay-at-home order.
 “How can something that is a fundamental constitutional right not be essential?” he said. “It’s just mind-blowing that a government official would make such a distinction.”
 Idaho had its first confirmed coronavirus infection March 13, and within three weeks another 1,000 people had been infected with the virus spreading through a community in central Idaho and highly populated southwestern Idaho. Little responded with an emergency declaration March 13 and, on March 25, issued a statewide stay-at-home order for Idaho’s 1.75 million residents that also shut down nonessential businesses.
 Little on Thursday allowed the five-week stay-at-home order to expire, and put in place Friday the first of his four-stage plan to recover from the economic damage caused by the virus. Each stage lifts restrictions as long as there isn’t a second wave of infections.
 On Friday, Idaho had more than 2,000 confirmed cases with at least 60 deaths due to the virus, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Los medios oficiales del régimen recogen la asistencia de Kim a una ceremonia que marcaba la finalización de la construcción de una planta de fertilizantes en Sunchon, en la provincia de Pyongan del Sur.
 Se trata de la primera aparición del líder norcoreano en unas tres semanas, una larga ausencia que, unida al hecho de que no asistió a varios eventos importantes del régimen, generó todo tipo de especulaciones sobre su estado de salud e incluso sobre su posible muerte.
 Kim asistió al acto celebrado el viernes en Sunchon y cortó una cinta inaugural en las instalaciones, según recoge la agencia estatal norcoreana KCNA, que por el momento no ha publicado imágenes del acto.
 La propaganda norcoreana llevaba desde el 12 de abril sin informar de una actividad sobre el terreno o publicar una imagen actual de Kim Jong-un, aunque sí había anunciado desde entonces del envío por parte del líder de mensajes de agradecimiento a trabajadores o cartas diplomáticas.
 En ese contexto, marcado a su vez por la pandemia de coronavirus, y ante la tradicional opacidad del régimen norcoreano, diferentes medios han publicado informaciones, citando siempre fuentes anónimas, en las que se dice que el estado de salud del mariscal es delicado, en muchos casos por una supuesta operación de corazón.
 El primer medio en publicar algo así fue el diario digital Daily NK (basado en Seúl y con extensos contactos en el Norte), que informó de que Kim habría sido trasladado a Hyangsan (110 kilómetros al noreste de Pionyang) para operarse del corazón.
 El Gobierno de Corea del Sur restó credibilidad a estas informaciones y señaló que la ausencia pública de Kim podía deberse a interés del régimen por reducir la escala de grandes eventos en el marco de sus esfuerzos por combatir el coronavirus. EFE

No matter, there was still time. In the 60th minute came the game’s pivotal moment. Clive Goodyear was wrongly deemed to have fouled Aldridge in the penalty area. With 29 goals that season, surely Aldridge couldn’t miss from the spot. But Beasant dived to his left to become the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in a Wembley FA Cup final. He would later tell how he had studied Aldridge’s technique. From nowhere, people leapt up in front of me. Disguised Wimbledon fans? I’m not sure, but Aldridge fell to his knees with his head in his hands, the stadium quietened and Wimbledon held on.

ATLANTA -- Dan Quinn says the NFC South has earned a new moniker.
   
 The Atlanta Falcons coach notes the division "is turning into Quarterback South."
   
 Tom Brady's arrival has raised the stakes.
   
 "I think in this division, you had better be ready to bring it," Quinn said.
   
 The priority to "bring it" on defense was evident in the NFL draft, as shock waves from Brady's move from New England to Tampa Bay were felt throughout the division. The quarterback standards in the division are exceptionally high.
   
 When Brady signed with the Buccaneers, the NFC South owned three of the top 10 passing leaders in NFL history. Drew Brees of three-time defending division champion New Orleans is No. 1. Brady has the second-most yards. Atlanta's Matt Ryan is No. 10.
   
 "I think it makes the whole division even more competitive than it already is," Quinn said. "... I think it just adds to a strength of what I already thought was a strong division."
   
 Carolina became the first team in the common draft era to use all of its draft picks on defensive players. Atlanta added defensive help with four of its six picks. After Carolina took Auburn defensive tackle Derrick Brown in the first round, Atlanta grabbed Brown's partner on the defensive front, Marlon Davidson, in the second round. Each will be chasing Brady and Brees.
   
 Saints coach Sean Payton says Brady, a six-time Super Bowl champion, has brought "a big change" to the South.
   
 "Obviously you defend his talent ... which is outstanding, but it's also what he brings to the rest of the team," Payton said. "One of the great strengths a player like Tom has is those others around him get better, and I'm sure we will see an entirely different type of Tampa Bay team because of his presence. He was a great sign by Tampa. This division has gotten a lot stronger."
   
 Tampa Bay also traded for Brady's longtime tight end in New England, Rob Gronkowski.
   
 Gronkowski's return from a one-year retirement gives Brady a familiar target. If healthy, Gronkowski's value on third downs and in the red zone could be crucial for a team without a playoff appearance since 2007.
   
 SUPER BOWL DREAMS
   
 Suddenly the Buccaneers, 7-9 last season, are viewed as Super Bowl contenders. Vegasinsider.com rates Tampa Bay and New Orleans as co-favorites in the division. Among NFC teams, only San Francisco is given better odds to win the Super Bowl.
   
 Asked if his team can reach the Super Bowl, Tampa Bay coach Bruce Arians said "I think so."
   
 "I don't think talent will be the issue whether we make the playoffs or not," Arians said. "Now the Super Bowl, there's some luck that comes with that, like staying healthy and some other things. But talent will not be an issue to keep us out the playoffs, no."
   
 NEW KID IN TOWN
   
 After 20 seasons with the Patriots, Brady, 42, is a newcomer to the NFC South and has much to learn about his new division rivals.
   
 "These teams know each other so well and I didn't play this division but once every four years, so I've got to learn the players, I've got to learn the schemes," Brady said. "There's a lot of things I have to learn and get up to speed on. That's where all my time and energy will be focused on, and also learning my teammates.''
   
 REPLACING CAM
   
 New Carolina quarterback Teddy Bridgewater replaces Cam Newton, who was released. Bridgewater has the unenviable task of meeting the standards set by Quarterback South members.
   
 Brees and Brady have won Super Bowls. Ryan and Brady have been league MVP. Bridgewater, 27, started a combined six games the last two seasons as Brees' backup in New Orleans.
   
 "I feel like I am the only one who hasn't proved himself in this league," Bridgewater said. "I feel like there is an opportunity for me. Being in a division with two guys who won MVPs and two guys who won Super Bowls, that is a great feeling to be among those guys. I just have to work hard to try to get up to those guys' level."
   
 NEW HOME FOR WINSTON
   
 Brady is replacing Jameis Winston, who agreed to a one-year deal with New Orleans. Winston will play behind Brees in the role formerly held by Bridgewater. The Saints already have re-signed versatile backup Taysom Hill.
   
 YOUNG SECONDARY
   
 Falcons first-rounder A.J. Terrell of Clemson will be expected to contribute at cornerback. He'll join Isaiah Oliver and Kendall Sheffield, who were added in the last two drafts, and Blidi Wreh-Wilson, in his third season, to form a young cast at cornerback -- a group that will be tested by Brees and Brady.
   
 "Those are two great quarterbacks, and they're going to get my best out there when I'm on the field," Terrell said, adding he must "earn my respect."

PORTLAND, Ore. — A top Oregon parole board official said Thursday the agency is reviewing seven inmates for early release because of their severe medical conditions and has asked corrections staff to evaluate an additional 60 inmates for possible release.
 The board decided to consider the cases after receiving an estimated 1,000 requests from inmates since the coronavirus emerged in Oregon, said Dylan Arthur, executive director of the Oregon Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision.
 Some of those requests were for the same inmates; Arthur estimated that about 500 inmates had sought early release because of medical conditions, the Oregonian/OregonLive reported.
 By law, the board may consider releasing inmates before the end of their sentences only if they fall under a limited set of circumstances: They must have a severe medical condition, including terminal illness, or be elderly and permanently incapacitated.
 The first seven are severely ill. The other 60 are older than 60 and incapacitated.
 Arthur said chronic conditions such as heart disease or asthma won’t solely qualify someone for release.
 Regardless of a person’s medical status, age or disability, prisoners serving mandatory minimum sentences under Oregon’s Measure 11 law are not eligible to get out early.
 Arthur said the parole board will review each case and will consider what resources and support the person has if they were to get out.
 Early releases by the parole board are rare. He said the process will include notifying victims if an offender is released ahead of schedule.

The answer, generally, is no, said Robb Engen, a fee-only financial planner based in Lethbridge, Alta. and author of the popular personal finance blog _Boomer and Echo_.
 If you are investing for a long-term savings goal, have put your money in a wide variety of investments and can stomach the ups and downs of your portfolio, then riding out a market crash like the one we just saw is the name of the game, Engen said.
 Whenever stocks take a dive like the one markets experienced in the first three weeks of March 2020, there is always the impulse to cut one's losses and cash out, said David Dyck, chartered investment manager at WealthBar, a Vancouver-based robo advisor.
 The problem with that, though, is that it's very difficult to know when to get back into the market — and according to Dyck, history shows missing out on some of the days when stocks are rallying generally costs investors more, in the long run, than whatever they saved by avoiding part of the stock plunge.
 An investor who missed just five of the best days of the S&P 500 stock market index between 1980 and 2018 would have ended up with 35 per cent lower returns, according to research by Fidelity Investments.
 And the trouble is, "you just don't know when the good days are going to happen," Dyck said. In fact, he added, the good days are "often surrounded by the bad ones."

Now let's clarify a few things about these numbers. First, retirement portfolios are generally down due to COVID-19's battering of the stock market earlier this year. Prior to the crisis, the average IRA balance was $115,400, while the average 401(k) balance was $112,300. In other words, retirement savers are looking at serious losses right now, at least on paper or on screen, so the fact that average balances are below $100,000 isn't necessarily a function of poor saving habits but rather, the toll of the pandemic on the stock market.

Ultimately, another phase of geopolitical détente prevailed, and a different form of global war has commenced. This pandemic has attacked not only the health of seafarers but also their dignity and well-being. The International Labor Organization (ILO) and other international institutions have called on their member states to treat seafarers as ‘key workers,’ fearing that donors and suppliers in several parts of the world be prohibited from delivering medical supplies, fuel, water, and provisions to ships amid fear that crews inside the ship are infected with COVID-19.

But there's very clearly going to be a negative impact on Social Security from the coronavirus. In a four-week span, more than 26 million people have filed for initial unemployment benefits, with no definitive time frame as to how long they'll be out of work. That's bad news for Social Security, given that nearly 89% of the $1.06 trillion in revenue collected in 2019 was derived from the 12.4% payroll tax on earned income (wages and salary, but not investment income). If people aren't generating earned income -- unemployment benefits are exempt from the payroll tax -- Social Security's revenue collection goes down the tubes very quickly.

Owners of more than 120 of Georgia's most popular restaurants announced this week they won't be reopening their doors just yet, despite getting a green light to do so from the governor.
 Gov. Brian Kemp said customers could again go to restaurants for dine-in service starting April 27 as long as eateries put in place measures to mitigate staff and guest exposure to coronavirus. The state has, so far, had more than 27,490 infections and at least 1,169 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
 In a full-page advertisement in a local newspaper, more than 50 restaurateurs said they would hunker down a little longer.
