With all the talk ahead of England's Euro 2012 Group D opener against France being of how vastly inferior Roy Hodgson's squad was to that of Laurent Blanc's France, the nature of the match that unfolded should have come as no surprise. England were generally happy to sit men behind the ball and let France have possession 30 yards from their goal. Although it may not have made for a great spectacle, it seemed to do the trick, and England nabbed a point which should stand them in good…

 Nearly one in three renters in the U.S. failed to pay their April rent at the beginning of the month, a landlord industry group warned Wednesday.
 That's a big increase in missed payments, compared with even one month before. In March, 81% of households paid the rent within the first days of the month. By April, on-time payments dropped to 69% of households.
 It's not really surprising that so many tenants couldn't make the rent this month, considering that 16.6 million people _ roughly one in 10 workers - have filed for unemployment in the last three weeks.
 But it's still shocking to see how quickly so many renters sank into financial distress. It's another reminder that too many people live paycheck to paycheck, and teeter on the edge of losing their home even in normal times.
 California and other states have halted evictions during the coronavirus emergency. That will keep people housed during the pandemic. When the cash payments of $1,200 or more per family and the extra unemployment benefits in the federal rescue package begin to arrive, that will help some tenants cover their rent. Homeowners are getting a hand too; Congress and federal regulators have told mortgage lenders to let borrowers delay mortgage payments without penalty if they're affected by the pandemic.
 Still, there are many people who will lose income during the social distancing driven shutdowns and the recession they are causing. No state has yet figured out what to do when the emergency is over and how cash-strapped renters will manage when all that delayed rent comes due.
 That's a huge problem that could set off a chain reaction of distress.
 Tenants who can't pay their rent debt will face eviction, which can damage their credit and make it more difficult to rent another home. Many will likely have a hard time finding stable housing they can afford. California had a homelessness crisis before the pandemic. If evictions skyrocket after the emergency has passed, that will only add to the misery.
 To avoid the kind of suffering and economic devastation that played out after the last recession, struggling renters will need a bailout. They will need some kind of rental assistance now to help avoid building up a debt that they can't pay. Or they'll need some kind of rent debt forgiveness down the road.
 A growing number of housing advocates and local elected officials are calling on governors in California, New York, Washington and other states to use their emergency powers to cancel rent and put a moratorium on landlords' mortgage payments during the coronavirus emergency. It looks like no governor has yet taken up the call to action, which is understandable because there are all kinds of complexities and ramifications that come from canceling rent.
 One of the biggest questions is who should pay the cost of the rescue.
 Landlords? No. That's not fair. There are lots of landlords who are small business owners and rely on rent payments for their income or their retirement. We want landlords to stay in business. They provide an essential service: a roof over one's head.
 Besides, they've got problems of their own. Denied much-needed rent payments during the emergency, they risk foreclosure if their lenders don't give them the option to delay mortgage payments. They face other penalties too if they can't pay their property taxes or properly maintain their buildings. And they need to pay the employees who manage the day-to-day operations of properties.
 Worse, the financial toll caused by lost rental income could prompt landlords to sell their properties in droves, which could trigger a real estate market crash. Or it could also hasten the ongoing shift from mom-and-pop landlords to investment firms. Advocates say that shift, which accelerated after the last recession, has already resulted in the loss of older, more affordable apartments as investors buy up properties to remodel and raise the rents.
 Well, then, how about making mortgage lenders provide a cushion? Maybe. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are offering landlords forbearance if they do not evict tenants who can't pay the rent during the coronavirus emergency. Landlords without government-backed loans don't automatically get that relief, so a housing industry group is lobbying Congress to require forbearance for all multifamily mortgages. It's somewhat easier for the banks that make mortgage loans to abide delayed payments. The lenders will eventually get most of their money when the loans are paid off.
 How about sticking Wall Street and big investors with the bill? That's what some tenant groups have advocated. They want large corporate owners of rental housing and big banks that were bailed out after the last financial crisis to eat some or all of the cost of rent forgiveness. Yet some experts warn that could create problems, too. Lenders typically sell mortgages to the financial industry, which then bundles them into securities and resells them to investors. The buyers often are pension funds and insurance companies. When landlords default on the mortgages, that decreases the value of the bonds and, ultimately, the public employee pension funds that invested in them. So taxpayers have an interest in making sure Wall Street gets paid too.
 Ultimately, the federal government is going to have to provide the policy direction and a lot more money to keep tenants housed, keep landlords whole and to stabilize the real estate market. The simplest solution would be for Congress to create an emergency coronavirus housing voucher to help struggling tenants cover the rent. Or perhaps Congress could direct mortgage companies to offer forbearance for, say, three to six months, with the federal government picking up the incremental costs associated with delayed payments.
 There's simply too much at stake for Congress and the Trump administration to be passive observers of any eviction tidal wave. They have a moral obligation to save the U.S. from another housing crisis.

Still other Making Masks 4 Burke group members have taken on the task of making masks while maintaining their day jobs.
 Traci Greenwood is a registered nurse at Carolinas HealthCare System Blue Ridge Morganton. Greenwood has made more than 340 masks as of Wednesday, including more than 100 for Autumn Care of Drexel, a local retirement community.
 “I like doing a lot of different charity projects,” Greenwood said. “I love to sew, so this was one thing that I knew that I could do. I do a lot of sewing for animal rescues, so I have a lot of spare material. As a nurse, I know how important it is to go to work and feel safe. There’s a need, and it’s just a way I can give back.”
 Greenwood, who first began making masks in early March when she crafted two masks for her elderly parents, said she has also had people reach out to her through her private Facebook page to have her make them masks. She charges $3 per mask for community members, while the masks she makes for health care workers are free of charge.
 “The beauty of having (Denise) run the group is that she has more time to coordinate,” Greenwood said. “Literally, all I do is sew. Like today, I finished work at 4 p.m. and I’ve cut masks out, I’ve been ironing. I’ll sit in front of the TV tonight with my husband and cut more masks out. So, that’s just what I do.
 “We’re proud of Burke County. We’re proud of first responders. We’ll do anything to help them.”
 Like Greenwood, Tom and Wendy Wise, employees at EJ Victor, work during the day and make masks at night and on weekends.
 The group has made orders for people at hospice centers, hospitals, post offices, a cancer center, nursing homes, grocery stores and Navy ships, among other organizations and businesses, Brank said.
 “It’s just an overwhelming event,” Brank said. “We’re probably not even making a tiny dent in any of that, but at least we’re all out here trying. It’s been a community-wide effort – a county-wide effort of people trying to get all this stuff together.”
 “These wonderful ladies, gentlemen and children have all worked so tirelessly,” Brank said. “It is truly a labor of love. It is a community coming together for one common denominator: keeping our communities and loved ones safe.
 “Burke County is a wonderful bunch of people, “Brank said. “Thank you to those that donated to our cause and to each seamstress who spent out of pocket as well. When you get right down to it, we are all family in a crisis.”

 Mail-in voting is the best way to ensure that the November 2020 election can proceed safely despite the coronavirus pandemic. It's all too likely we'll still be dealing with outbreaks then, and it's well before we'll have a vaccine. The U.S. needs to start making plans for mail-in ballots now; and yet President Donald Trump has begun to make it clear he intends to stymie any large-scale vote-by-mail efforts.
 Mail-in voting will become the key battleground because it's essentially the only realistic option for holding an election during a pandemic. Donald Trump can't delay the Nov. 3 vote _ that's beyond his constitutional power. In fact, the Constitution doesn't provide any option for suspending or delaying a presidential or congressional election.
 Congress "may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes," according to the Constitution, but precedent makes it pretty certain that Congress won't delay the presidential election either; it didn't even do so in 1864, when the Civil War was in full swing.
 What about the states? Well, technically, individual states could choose their presidential electors themselves, without holding a popular vote. That's the way states did it in the early decades of the Republic. That history has led some fretful folks to ask me whether some state legislatures might call off the 2020 vote and just let their electors decide how to allocate the states electoral votes. In practice, though, it seems unlikely to the point of impossibility that governors and state legislatures would steal the election from the public.
 Hence the dispute over mail-in ballots. Conventional wisdom is that mail-in voting would be good for Democrats and bad for Republicans. I am far from certain that the conventional wisdom will prove to be true, since mail-in voting under pandemic conditions may actually disadvantage some key Democratic constituencies (like young voters, or poor ones, or elderly African-Americans) more than it disadvantages Republican voting blocs. But President Trump seems to be inclined to accept the conventional wisdom.
 The upshot is that we are seeing the emergence of a partisan struggle over mail-in voting. As Wisconsin held its own coronavirus-constrained primary, President Trump discouraged the state from creating the extensive mail-in ballot options that alone can solve the problem of voting during a pandemic. Democrats have proposed a bill in Congress, known as the Resilient Elections During Quarantines and Natural Disasters Act of 2020, that would provide financial incentives to push the states to allow absentee, mail-in voting for any reason.
 Trump in turn denounced previous Democratic bills in nakedly self-interested terms: "They had things, levels of voting," he said, "that if you'd ever agreed to it, you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again."
 It's a hard lift to find a valid reason to oppose letting people vote by mail, considering the broad availability of absentee voting (already available in at least 34 states), not to mention the realities of a global pandemic. Trump's solution is to point to the threat of voter fraud that he associates with mail-in ballots.
 Republicans in recent years have passed voter ID laws aimed to check identification and, in theory, make fraudulent voting more difficult. But as experts have repeatedly pointed out in court battles over these voter ID laws, the actual instances of voter fraud are tiny relative to the pervasiveness and effect of the laws. It's an open secret that voter ID laws are intended to disproportionately discourage people from groups who tend to vote Democratic from casting ballots.
 Naive as it is to imagine that anything is outside the bounds of partisanship in an election year, it's still worth making the point that elections are supposed to give effect to the preferences of the voters. No one should have to risk his or her life to go to the polls. If states either constrain absentee voting or lack the resources to enable it to function effectively, the consequences for our democracy could be disastrous. Enabling a free and fair vote even under pandemic conditions should be the very epitome of a nonpartisan objective.
 It's time for responsible Republicans to stand up and say that there is no other choice but mail-in voting. In the spirit of 1864, we must hold the election by any means necessary.
