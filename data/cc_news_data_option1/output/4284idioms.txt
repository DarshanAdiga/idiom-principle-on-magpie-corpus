But Arizona law still does not explicitly protect LGBTQ Arizonans from discrimination or the dangerous, discredited practice of so-called “conversion therapy.” In these and so many other aspects of life, LGBTQ Arizonans are vulnerable to discrimination. Kelly can change that by helping to pass a range of protections on the federal level, and by helping to block the appointment of judges that have no regard for basic human rights.
 The Human Rights Campaign has invested deeply in Arizona to help make these protections and this transformation possible, with a staff working around the clock to mobilize voters, and we have endorsed pro-equality leaders up and down the ballot. These are the leaders we must elect, from the halls of Congress, to the statehouse, to local governments across the state, in order to protect our community.

A drink and drug-addled man who slashed a night worker in the head with a large blade has been jailed.
 Gabriel Brzezik was trying to sleep but remonstrated with a neighbour about being disturbed.
 Bristol Crown Court heard that, shortly after, there was a knock at his door in Victoria Park Flats, Weston-super-Mare.
 As the door was opened the neighbour's friend, Kurt Jordan, used a large blade to stab Brzezik in the side of his head.
 Jordan, 41, of Upper Church Road in Weston-super-Mare, pleaded guilty to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in August last year.
 Judge Euan Blair jailed him for five years.
 He told Jordan: "It was a blow struck with a knife to the victim's head which caused a significant wound above the hairline.
 "The effect on him is ongoing, you were under the influence of alcohol and you have previous convictions for violence."

One of the heavier standouts on a record that explores several socially conscious themes as well as personal emotions as we navigate through our daily lives, "Culture War" takes the good fight to nearly societal ill you can shake double devil horns at. Musically, the track is a blast of Iron Maiden's laser- precise picking and dynamics, mixed with just enough of Cornell's highs to drive the song's many points home. The punk protests in the lyrics may be catchy as all get out, but according to Maged, "I had a lot to get out on this record. It was a two-year therapy session." Uneasy topics don't come easy when your music does more than go through the motions. Maged self-produced the record, and the serrated edge of "Culture War" is a raw, emotional intro to a triumphant, cathartic album born of one man's pain laid bare.

An ABC's political director Rick Klein joins me now for more on this rich and Rick what's your take overall last night. It was so nice wanted to be and be able to free speech it was just such a striking difference from the nudity we saw three weeks ago. I think both candidates can feel good about how they landed their closing arguments and it really is the contents of the campaign now it's not now. Undecided voters or mystical way it's about persuading your base acting. I'm neither candidate I I think what it's found a better way Europe. A better better than 92 just laid out there and I BT you're watching this in conjunction with the other ends of the last couple weeks you know pretty good sense of these candidates are really aren't people what they wanted to. Yet the moderator Kristen Welker and O'Dowd did a great job the muted Mike's thing seems to be getting some positive feedback to conducting the way forward for debates and other races now. You don't actually work. I think just because they need more money Wilson he's rusty each other that submitted its home that was just give for a I was surprised I was skeptical of the rules change I thought the candidates get hijacked however they like. And I was wrong the commission being. I need a Smart change and a lot of heat order but in the end I duty contributed to a more civil tone down and they are probably. It's a with corona virus cases on the right the pandemic front and center for so many people that either of them do enough to persuade Americans that and they are the right person to lead us through this. Well you just because they have such disparate messaging. Are you really depend. Hands on how you see this because on the issue of the corona virus you heard it all how they are you heard. Joseph I didn't say. Did you densities Americans repeated this president he cannot be reelected he saw and you heard. Presidential say rallied quarter are the optimism Becky brought to is the Portuguese are. The country wants to have some hope that once a bite him. With the economy. We did with the recovery they're gonna TG's. His vision or so. Fundamentally different argument in July and he says people who lived their lives and he's waste and it they're ready for different arguments. All of them can feel good job and your ability Nazi voters over the. And Rick they didn't step on each other in terms of talking too much but they didn't pull any punches either president trump attacks hunter Biden's business dealings but an accused trump of hiding payments from foreign countries. Did those attacks at their integrity to those punches lands. We think you have to think about it is not necessarily persuading voters to stay with needy. Diminishing enthusiasm for the other other acting. You Donald comes goal is to meet Joseph Biden into just another member of the Washington establishment Clinton 2.0. The strategy is probably less I think he's ever wore it wouldn't be and the you done a good job Joseph Biden. I don't think Biden reminding people of the noise of the barrel up some of the audience you know corruption allegations that it in our minds forever. Back out. Might remind voters that are not every day you know the last three and happier and smoltz out with their favorite candidate. I do think it. You look kind of relevant enthusiasm questions like this and sometimes it is about when he someone knoller is much it is it is it is persuading someone else he's not there oh. And in the final question of the night they were asked what they would say their inaugural address to help unify the country so mean that many people are craving unity right now. Do you think they said that they needed to and that moment. Well I don't like his message is so much more geared toward unity that I beekeeper and more from him out of debt that really isn't the core message of Donald complex. All of them wearable clothes with a little bit of optimism and again. Despite or because this debate with so much easier to watch a little more optimistic than everybody did it. The yell at each other they didn't talk over it didn't call it aims to lay out very clear differences on policy. Overall what does this do for the race moving forward just eleven days left. Keep in mind almost fifty million Americans are worried about it so there's a limit to what anything you do to race. I think don't. Beat the truck campaign you've got a little bit extra Walesa now supporters in pointed this out and how rallying cries that some of the answers a July game on energy issues for instance. And that a new attacks and I think provide inside. You're using it will show extending his rounds the bases and a lot of by supporters who worried about. What televised debates like they're happy be on the other side of the ideal candidate I'm relieved to get back to their normally regularly scheduled. Right Rick Klein thank you Rick. And you can find out how to vote in your state at 538 dot com again the election just eleven days when.

ST. ALBANS — It took stops in New York City, Boston, France and Louisiana, but St. Albans native Derek Hoy has returned home to a position as the new chief financial officer (CFO) for Northwestern Counseling & Support Services (NCSS).
 “I’m glad to be back here,” said Hoy, who started his work at NCSS this week.
 After growing up on Smith Street and graduating from Bellows Free Academy, Hoy left to attend college in New York City. He then spent two years living and working in France before earning master’s degrees in business administration and educational administration from Boston College.
 It was in graduate school that he met his wife, a Louisiana native, and the pair moved to Louisiana before coming to Vermont.
 “This is an amazing state,” said Hoy, and the way people live here is “how we wanted to raise our kids.”
 “It took being out of state to realize how good things are,” he added.
 But the attraction Vermont holds for Hoy isn’t simply skiing, hiking and beautiful vistas, it’s also the resources Vermont puts toward health care.
 When his family moved to Louisiana, he shifted from working on education administration to a job for a company that provides home health and hospice care. “It sparked a deep interest in me,” Hoy said.
 It was his first exposure to health care and the continuum of care that connects hospitals, specialists, primary care doctors, mental health providers and organizations that provide in-home and hospice care.
 “As a state, Vermont is very in tune with partnerships and the continuum of care,” Hoy said. Vermont has also made support for mental health and well- being a priority, in his view.
 He also believes in the importance of mental health care. NCSS, Hoy said, is a perfect fit “in terms of my values and our family’s values.”
 Working at NCSS also connects his two interests: education and health care. NCSS operates the Soar Learning Center for students with special needs, while also working with students in the area’s public schools.
 Although as CFO he is focused on the numbers, Hoy said “you still have to have a passion and a personal connection.”
 “I very much see my role as making sure that all of the mission-centric things can happen,” he said. That includes making sure clients can count on the resources they need and employees are taken care of, Hoy explained. NCSS is one of Franklin County’s largest employers.
 “If I’m doing my job right, I’m worried every day about our clients, our employees,” he said.
 How health care is paid for is continually changing and part of his role is to stay on top of those changes and how they impact NCSS, according to Hoy.
 Growing up in St. Albans, “I was aware of [NCSS], but they didn’t have the amazing resources they have now,” said Hoy, explaining he was excited to be “part of something bigger than myself.”
 He is also excited to be working with NCSS’s many partners, citing in particular the close physical proximity of NCSS, Northwestern Medical Center, and Franklin County Home Health Agency, and the ways in which they work together and with other agencies. “We’re all connected and working together,” Hoy said.
 “We have a lot of caring and compassionate people.”

The debate, moderated by NBC's Kristen Welker, was a final chance for each man to make his case to a television audience of tens of millions. And questions swirled beforehand as to how Trump, whose hectoring performance at the first debate was viewed by aides as a mistake that turned off viewers, would perform amid a stretch of the campaign in which he has taken angry aim at the news media and unleashed deeply personal attacks on Biden and his adult son.

“It is important to note that is the best-case scenario, but is not likely,” Chau said via email. “There is no evidence that our metrics are moving substantially enough to achieve meeting the requirements in that timeframe. Orange County metrics have been quite consistent over the past month in the red tier range, but not qualifying for orange. The difference between our current metrics and the requirements for the yellow tier require a substantial decrease in disease burden, which is difficult to achieve during the best-case scenario timeframe.”

DEARBORN HEIGHTS, Mich. (WJRT/Gray News) - A Dearborn Heights man accidentally purchased two Mega Millions tickets for the June 9 drawing.That accident turned into a stroke of good luck, as both tickets matched the five white balls -- 01-05-09-10-23 -- and each brought him a separate $1 million prize.Samir Mazahem, 56, bought the tickets online from the Michigan Lottery. He played numbers that correspond to birthdays in his family.“I forgot to save the numbers as favorites in the app, so I went back in and set them up as favorites so I could easily play them in the future,” Mazahem said. “What I didn’t realize, is that meant I would be buying a second ticket with the same numbers.”He was “a little bummed” after he discovered he actually bought two tickets costing $2 apiece for the same drawing and didn’t give it much thought. Then Mazahem logged onto the Michigan Lottery website and discovered there are not one -- but two -- separate $1 million prizes waiting.Once I figured out I had bought two tickets with identical numbers, I was a little bummed but didn’t think much about it.“Saying that I was stunned is an understatement,” he said. “I couldn’t believe it was real. It took several days for the reality to set in that my mistake had paid off to the tune of $2 million.”Mazahem recently visited Michigan Lottery headquarters in Lansing to claim his prizes. He plans to buy a home with his winnings and save the rest for a comfortable retirement.“Winning is exciting and gives me some comfort knowing that when I retire, I will have money in the bank,” Mazahem said.Copyright 2020 WJRT via Gray Media Group, Inc.

But the presence of militia groups at polls could pose real safety concerns in light of a new Amnesty International report that said U.S. law enforcement failed to protect peaceful protesters from violent attacks by armed vigilante groups and counter-protesters in nearly 200 cases from May to September. The report, released Friday, said law enforcement often neglected to deploy an adequate amount of trained officers, separate or de-escalate tensions between opposing groups and often harmed peaceful protesters while dealing with violent ones.

This doesn't cut it for me. And, it shouldn't for you, either. In my mind, it's one thing for social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook to ban viral content that is obviously false or hateful. It's another thing altogether for these outlets to essentially make themselves the standard and guardians of what they subjectively consider real journalism, i.e., not left- leaning enough for them. It's a double standard. Pure and simple.
