Hulk Hogan has his own thoughts on the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that it's an act of God similar to the 10 plagues of Egypt and that people need Jesus more than a vaccine.

"We can all help slow the spread by covering our faces," he said. "It's imporant to understand that covering does not protect you from infection. Physical distancing is still one hundred percent necessary. You need to keep at least six feet away from other people even when you are wearing a face covering, but face coverings will help slow the spread of the virus. That's because up to about 25 percent of the people who are infected are not showing symptoms right now. Many are still out and about because they don't feel sick."

Denise said "I'm the wardrobe supervisor at the Barn Theatre, and as my work there has ceased for the time being, I have time on my hands. When I saw the appeal to make scrubs for the NHS I jumped at the chance to help. This is extremely important to me as my daughter works for NHS Scotland and several other close family members are also working on the front line for NHS England. In a small way I feel I can support them by doing what I love most - sewing, and am grateful to be able to help."

To the editor:
 In response to the editorial "We need wartime leaders" published March 30.
 The job Trump has done is disastrously inadequate? Your editorial is totally wrong and is a disservice to the community you serve. Maybe you should focus your efforts closer to the City of Champions and look for a solution to the daily gun fire on the streets of Brockton.
 And if you have any time left, visit a Brockton courthouse and try and make sense out the way the court systems are allowing the felons to walk freely out the door after numerous arrests, on the same charges!
 As your opinion editorial opening statement says, "we need wartime leaders."
 Please look out your backdoor, the war is moving in closer than you realize.
 Help the local police now.
