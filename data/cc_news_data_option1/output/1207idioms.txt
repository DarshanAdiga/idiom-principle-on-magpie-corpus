Johannesburg, Mar 26 (AFP) South Africa braced for a nationwide lockdown Thursday, joining other African countries imposing strict curfews and shutdowns in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus across the continent.
 Some 57 million people will be restricted to their homes during South Africa's three-week total lockdown which begins at midnight.
 Kenya, Rwanda and Mali are some of the African countries that have imposed restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus with the continent recording 2,748 cases and 73 deaths so far.
 Although Africa's toll is far lower than in Europe, the United States and the Middle East, health experts say the world's poorest continent is especially vulnerable and the figures likely fall far short of the reality.
 During South Africa's 21-day shutdown there will be no jogging, dog-walking or sale of alcohol across the country, which has so far recorded 709 cases, the highest number of detected infections in sub-Saharan Africa.
 Nigeria's government warned Thursday that Africa's most populous nation could soon see an "exponential" increase in coronavirus infections unless contacts of confirmed cases are tracked down quicker.
 Hours before the start of the lockdown, panicky residents in South Africa's economic hub Johannesburg stocked up on food and other supplies with some large supermarkets running out of eggs and the staple maize meal powder.
 Queues formed outside food shops across the country as people stocked up for the 21-day shutdown.
 At a popular chain of grocery shop in Johannesburg's Douglasdale suburb some customers were loading trolleys full of lagers and wines.
 One man tried to jump the queue saying he was only going to the liquor store and did not consider it necessary for him to join the long queue of other shoppers. He was politely told to be patient by a face-masked marshal who carried a jar of hand sanitiser to spray trolley handles.
 Elsewhere, thousands of people crammed long-distance bus terminals to escape to the countryside to be with families, raising fears they would export the virus to the most vulnerable old who normally reside or retire to farms and villages.
 President Cyril Ramaphosa has called for half-an-hour of national prayers on the eve of the lockdown.
 He requested South Africans observe two minutes of "prayer, reflection or silent meditation" between 6pm (1600 GMT) and 6:30pm (1630 GMT) wherever they will be.
 "These are challenging times. We are traversing a path we have never travelled before. There are many amongst us who are fearful, uncertain and vulnerable," he said.
 "I call on our people to offer a prayer and a thought for the protection and healing of our land and its people from this disease." As with other African countries, South Africa's lockdown will be patrolled by the military and the police.
 Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula warned "if people are not complying, they (the military) may be forced to take extraordinary measures." Violation of any of the regulations will carry a six-month jail sentence or fine.
 Two men have already been charged with attempted murder for defying a quarantine order and allegedly going out after they tested positive for the coronavirus, exposing others to the infection.
 "It's not a fairytale to say the law will act and act very harsh on you," Police Minister Bheki Cele said.
 Moody's Investors Service warned Friday that the effect of border closures, commodity price declines and financial market volatility due to the pandemic will have "severe macroeconomic and financial impact on African sovereigns".
 In one early indication of the likely impact of the pandemic on Africa's economy, rubber processors in Ivory Coast -- the continent's largest producer -- said they were bracing for losses of around $100 million a month.
 "Right now, our biggest clients, in Asia, Europe and America, have closed down. The progressive impact of this will be a slowdown in rubber processing activity, even a closedown," said Eugene Kremien, president of industry association Apromac.
 "Our industry is already suffering, and it's just the start. We are going to lose 60 billion CFA francs ($100 million, 91 million euros) each month, which compares with the 600 billion CFA (in income) we were expecting this year." (AFP)

This puts undue stress on officers and the families to find accommodation when everything is locked down and everyone is competing for the same few spaces.'
 Sharon Chambers' 20-year-old daughter was moved into a Travelodge in Bromley, south-east London, in March, after she lost the use of both legs.
 The family home was not suitable for a wheelchair, and the hospital ward she had been on was to be used to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.
 Ms Chambers, 58, said her daughter was given less than an hour's notice to leave, and added that Lewisham Council was initially not made aware of Travelodge's plans, which the council confirmed.
 Later, the hotel informed Ms Chambers' daughter that she would be allowed to stay the night, and on Wednesday morning she was moved to a nearby branch.
 'The whole situation, the way it was handled, is just absolutely disgusting,' Ms Chambers told PA.
 'The only reason it got resolved was that we stood our ground. For people who didn't have someone to give them the backing, they ended up in far different circumstances.'
 James Yalden, from Guildford, Surrey, was told he had to leave a Travelodge in the town on Tuesday.
 The 55-year-old had been staying in the hotel with his partner while they waited for builders to complete work on his flat, and was left with nowhere to go upon being told to leave.
 'I went down to reception to redo my car parking and the receptionist very offhandedly said 'Oh, just to let you know, you need to move out today',' Mr Yalden told PA. 'I wasn't expecting that.
 'I literally had nowhere else to go. I couldn't move to the new flat because there were no utilities working. I literally would have had to sleep in the car.'
 Mr Yalden said a tearful receptionist had been on the phone with the council to tell them she was about to ask those they had temporarily homed there to leave.
 He managed to get a place at a nearby Holiday Inn because his partner is a key worker at a supermarket.
 'I hope we remember after (coronavirus) those people that behaved well during it and those people that behaved badly, because I'll never stay in a Travelodge again,' he said.
 Travelodge said in a statement: 'Travelodge has been obliged to commence the temporary closure of its hotels in line with the instructions from the Government on 24 March 2020.
 'We do expect to remain open in selected critical locations across the country to support accommodation for emergency workers and other groups.
 'We are reviewing daily which hotels are best positioned to support the needs that arise with the government while ensuring we comply with the new restrictions in place to protect the public.'

The memo did not make it to Obama. According to Noam Scheiber’s book _The Escape Artists_, when Romer showed her estimate to fellow Obama adviser Larry Summers, he dismissed the number as too high. She then prepared a memo where the most expensive option was $1.2 trillion. Summers still thought it too high, telling her, per Scheiber, “$1.2 trillion is nonplanetary.” That was his way of saying “ridiculous” or “out of this world.” Congress eventually passed, and Obama signed, a $787 billion package.

 The board is trying to curb this year’s spending with only three months left in the budget year, cutting into a deficit of several hundred thousand dollars. It’s also trying to get a handle on the town’s construction projects.
 On March 9, as the board met for the first time since town elections, new board member Dick Charland — who’d been on the board during Tropical Storm Irene in 2011 — led an effort to get all documents associated with those projects in one place and have the select board assistant, Jonathan DeLaBruere — who was primarily managing those projects — walk the board through each one so it could prioritize what work was needed most.

GuideStar, an organization that tracks nonprofits around the country, estimates that there are 1.8 million charities and other nonprofit organizations in the United States.  
 TaxExemptWorld, another tracker of nonprofits, estimates that there are 927 in Wayne County and 287 in Holmes County, with assets totaling $896 million and $316 million, respectively.  
 These organizations -- all designed to help the community -- focus on everything from education to arts and culture to animals to health to religion. They identify problems, provide solutions and offer assistance where gaps exist.  
 We likely either benefit from one of them or contribute to them, hoping to better our surroundings and our neighbors.  
 "Nonprofits play a vital role in building a healthy and thriving community," Stacy Schiemann, executive director of the United Way of Ashland County, told correspondent Linda Hall as she researched the topic.  
 They often do this behind the scenes and without the recognition that they truly deserve.  
 This year, we designed our annual Progress Edition to celebrate nonprofit organizations. It's a challenge to choose a theme for the Progress Edition, which is our largest special section of the year in terms of advertising. From a newsroom perspective, the Progress Edition has evolved over the years into a major enterprise reporting effort.  
 The trick is finding a theme that will generate good stories that tell our readers something about our community they likely don't already know. We hope you find that is the case with nonprofits.  
 Earlier this year -- and well before the coronavirus pandemic hit home -- we asked the community to make suggestions and reached out to major nonprofits such as the Wayne County Community Foundation and United Way of Wayne and Holmes Counties for their recommendations.  
 Within this section, you will find profiles on fewer than 20 nonprofits in the county. In other words, there are an overwhelming number of worthwhile organizations not represented on these pages. That doesn't mean they don't deserve to be highlighted by The Daily Record.  
 If you are aware of a nonprofit not featured here that should be, please let us know. Feel free to reach out to me at 330-287-1636 or rarmon@the-daily- record.com.  
 Another traditional component of Progress Editions are the profiles -- produced by our advertising department -- of businesses that are advertising in the section. These are local businesses that are making valuable contributions every day in our community. I'd encourage you to spend some time reading these.  
 Enjoy and thanks for reading The Daily Record.

NEW YORK (AP) — Robert Englund, the actor who turned Freddy Krueger into a fearsome household name, say he’s looking forward to someone else taking a stab at reviving the “Nightmare on Elm Street” franchise.


  Englund said it's time for Krueger’s razor-fingered glove to permanently pass to another actor.


  “I’m too old,” said the 72-year-old. “I know that everything gets remade eventually.”


  Englund played Krueger, a murderous villain who stalks his victims through their dreams, in eight films and occasionally on TV. He acknowledges a few years ago he thought he might've had the stamina for one more “Nightmare” movie, but compares the situation to “an athlete who can't get out of bed Monday morning.”


  He's eager to see someone else up the ante.


  “Now with the new technologies, films are gonna get remade because we can do special effects even better and more sophisticated, and I’m kind of looking forward to seeing a new ‘Nightmare’ film where they can really go crazy with a dream landscape, with the nightmare sequences, using some of the techniques used in ‘Inception’ or in that old Robin Williams film ‘What Dreams May Come.'”


  “A Nightmare on Elm Street” was revived in 2010 with Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy and also starring Rooney Mara, Katie Cassidy and Kellan Lutz. It received poor reviews but was a box office success, earning more than $115 million worldwide.

Following the combination of Alliance Boots and the legacy Walgreens, Walgreens Boots eliminated the three-month reporting lag and recast prior period results with no lag.As Walgreens Boots, management now reports results in three segments: Retail Pharmacy USA (176.43% of total revenues in fiscal 2019), Retail Pharmacy International (8.37%), and Pharmaceutical Wholesale (16.8%).

Moscow, Mar 26 (AFP) Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called for sanctions relief during the coronavirus pandemic, telling G20 leaders it was a matter "of life and death".
 The leader did not specify which countries should be earmarked for sanctions relief, speaking instead more broadly.
 "Ideally we should introduce a... joint moratorium on restrictions on essential goods as well as on financial transactions for their purchase," Putin said at a virtual meeting of G20 leaders on Thursday.
 "I am talking about the countries that are suffering the most from this pandemic. At the end of the day, it's a question of life and death, this is a purely humanitarian issue."
 "These matters should be freed of any politics," Putin added.
 Russia has been chafing under numerous rounds of Western sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its role in the Ukraine crisis. It is also an ally of a number other countries sanctioned by the West, namely Iran and North Korea.
 The Kremlin chief said it was important to establish "green corridors free of trade wars and sanctions" that would ensure supplies of medication, food, equipment and technology.
 Putin also predicted the current crisis would be tougher than the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and trade conflicts and sanctions would only exacerbate it.
 "undoubtedly cannot afford to act on the principle 'every man for himself'," the Russian president said, adding that countries needed to join forces in developing vaccines and drug treatments.
 The coronavirus and a steep drop in oil prices have caused a two-pronged crisis for the Russian economy, challenging Putin's promises to boost growth and raise living standards. (AFP)

Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) will not be declaring the 2020 10th class or Matriculation result any time soon. After the release of the 12th class result on March 24th, students from the 10th class were wondering if their result will also be declared soon.
 According to reports, the Chairman of BSEB Anand Kishor the result will be declared after April 15th. The evaluation process for the exam had been suspended until March 31st as a precautionary measure against Coronavirus pandemic. The evaluation process has been delayed further because of the complete lockdown announced by the Prime Minister and thus the result has been further delayed.
 According to a report by Hindustan Times, around 50% of the evaluation process has been completed for the 10th class in the state. Earlier, the result was supposed to be declared in the last week of March.
 BSEB announced the 12th class result a few days ago in which the students managed to score a pass percentage of 80.4%. This was slightly better than 2019 when the students had managed 79.6%.

The coronavirus crisis and the national lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 have brought to the fore the digital divide within the Indian equity and commodity markets. Right through this week while many brokers and a prominent brokers’ associations that have faced the brunt of the lockdown, have asked for equity and commodity markets to be closed, new-age brokerages that have a fully online business model and a young clientele have seen business grow by leaps and bounds. Apart from essential services like food, vegetables healthcare and media, the banks and the equity, commodities and bond markets in India are also operational during the lockdown, while most other commercial and manufacturing activities have been shut for 21-day period. The first problem for brokers have been getting to work, as the policemen on the streets have not been given clear instructions on allowing them to travel. Vijay Bhushan, president of the Association of National Stock Exchange Members of India, said in an interview with The Economic Times that many members of ANMI have complained of harassment by the police in Delhi, and his own staff members have been slapped on the way to work. Bhushan, based in Delhi, also owns a petrol pump, and says, he has been using his pump owner’s ID to move around as fuel as an essential service is better understood by policemen than financial markets. But even that did not cut ice with some policemen on Wednesday, Bhushan said. Apart from commuting to work, Bhushan’s staff also needs to stay in contact with his older clients, most of who still operate through physical modes that need to be ohysically handed over – like cheques and intimation slips. ANMI wrote to the markets regulator SEBI on March 25, asking it to close down the markets during the lockdown. Apart from brokers, stock exchange officials in Kolkata too faced commuting problems with the policemen, an official of Calcutta Stock Exchange said. Commodity traders face a different kind of problem, apart from the harassment. While the spot markets for agri-commodities are closed, the futures markets for commodities are open on commodity bourses. Narinder Wadhwa, the president of the Commodity Participants Association of India, explained how prices of chaana (gram) have shot up on the futures markets, while there is no spot trade happening. “These are delivery based contracts – and how will the delivery happen when the contract expires, if the spot markets are still closed?” Wadhwa batted for a shutdown of commodity exchanges if they close globally. However at the other end of the spectrum would be discount brokerages like Zerodha or Upstox that seem to have made the most of the predicament of the smaller mom and pop brokerages. Upstox is set to report a 35% jump in new demat accounts opening for the Jan-March 2020 quarter, compared to October-December 2019. December 2019 was its best month ever when it had opened one lakh new demat accounts. Also number of orders in March has been 55% higher than February, said Ravi Kumar, co-founder of Upstox. Kumar explained that as people found it difficult to operate through their usual brokers due to the lockdown and yet wanted to pick up cheap stocks as the indices plunged, enrolment of pure-play digital platforms like Upstox jumped. “We have a business continuity plan and our platform can operate even if none of our 200-member staff in Mumbai can go to office. This lockdown scenario is something we were fully prepared for,” Kumar said. He added that closing down markets in India now would be like downing a bank’s shutters, sending out a bad signal to the world. Even larger brokerage houses that do both physical as well as digital, batted for keeping markets open. Lav Chaturvedi, CEO of Reliance Securities said that India has the best technology stack when it comes to digital markets consumers and the markets should continue as usual. While access is one part of the problem, the lockdown has created other issues too. Quant and Algo-based trader Subhadip Nandy says the absence of volumes in the market is fairly notable. “We saw a stock like Indigo hitting the selling freeze in the morning and then the buying freeze in the evening. Something similar happened with Piramal. These kinds of wild fluctuations should not happen.” Nandy added that there were anomalous situations on the Nifty index futures too, which indicate something is broken in the markets. He further shared how while trading on ATM options he saw rapidly moving prices flashing on his screen. “The algorithm based trading provides a kind of parity and stability. This anomalies indicates the algos have been switched off as brokers are sitting at home, unable or unwilling to go to work. In its absence, anyone with a large order is being able to move the market,” Nandy said. Mumbai-based bonds trader Indradeep Khan said the bonds market is seeing a different problem as its participants are not as sophisticated as the equities market or the participants in terms of having backup strategies ready. “Because of Covid-19 people now want to hoard cash. Add to that aggressive selling of G-secs by foreign institutional investors, liquidity has dried up and corporate bonds are trading at weird levels.” Markets commentator and chairman of Inditrade Capital Sudip Bandyopadhyay feels this is an unprecedented situation but closing down markets can be an option only if New York Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange both close. “Otherwise if you close local markets with global markets operating, there will be huge trading in the grey markets, creating bigger problems.”

E.D. Hailey had a fashion tip for men in the event that they ever tied to a tree after having their cars hijacked.
 “It pays to wear an old rotten tie,” Hailey said, “or else I would still be where they left me.”
 Hailey was a Chevrolet auto dealer from Harrison, and in 1935, he survived such an ordeal.
 On the morning of October 24 of that year, Hailey was returning to Harrison from Berryville when he noticed two men walking along the highway. The Chevy dealer stopped and asked if they needed a ride.
 One of the men rode up front with Hailey, while the other sat in the back. Between Green Forest and Alpena, the man in the back seat placed a gun against Hailey’s head and told him to stop the car, while the other man grabbed the steering wheel.
 When Hailey asked the men what they were going to do to him, they replied that they were in a jam. They said they were going to go off the highway, tie him to a tree and take the car.
 Passing through Alpena, the car turned off onto Lick Branch road, upon Hailey’s suggestion, and went about a mile and a half. After Hailey stopped the car, the two men searched him for money.
 According to Hailey’s account, as told in the Harrison Daily Times, he told his abductors that they had picked the wrong man for money, but, ever the good car salesman, he told them they were getting a good car. The men took Hailey’s watch, but returned it when he said it was a keepsake.
 The men then tied Hailey’s hands behind him, used his handkerchief to gag him and used his necktie to bind his feet. They then took him into the woods and tied him to a tree. They told Hailey that they would tie him just tight enough to hold him until they got away.
 Five minutes after the men left with Hailey’s car, he managed to break the necktie around his feet, and walked to the road.
 Hailey came upon a woodchopper named Bliss, who released the car dealer’s hands. A Mr. Blasingame, who lived nearby, drove him into Alpena. Law enforcement was notified, and Hailey was taken back into Harrison.
 According to Hailey, his abductors were about 30 years old and well dressed. He believed them to be ex-convicts. They told Hailey that they were from Princeton, Missouri, and were on their way to New Orleans. They had shipped their luggage to Little Rock.
 Hailey told authorities that he had turned on the car’s radio to get the news, but when the two hitchhikers took over the car, they turned off the radio.
 Law enforcement officers from adjoining town were notified and a description of the men was broadcast on a Springfield, Missouri, radio station.
 In the newspaper account, it was said that Hailey’s car was a “Chevrolet Standard coach” that was owned by his son, Drexal. It had a National Guard license plate.

Moreover, it appears that the federal government will be lenient in the way that it interprets the law. For instance, the initial determination of whether you'll be eligible to get a coronavirus check will likely come from your 2018 or 2019 tax return, because the Treasury wants to get checks out as quickly as possible. Technically, eligibility for the credit depends on your income on your 2020 tax return. However, details in the bill give the IRS the latitude to look the other way for those who get checks but have higher 2020 income that would otherwise leave them ineligible. It's therefore likely that if your income meets the threshold either in previous years _or_ this year, you'll eventually get your $1,200.

 GuideStar, an organization that tracks nonprofits around the country, estimates that there are 1.8 million charities and other nonprofit organizations in the United States.  
 TaxExemptWorld, another tracker of nonprofits, estimates that there are 560 in Ashland County, with assets totaling $458 million.  
 These organizations -- all designed to help the community -- focus on everything from education to arts and culture to animals to health to religion. They identify problems, provide solutions and offer assistance where gaps exist.  
 We likely either benefit from one of them or contribute to them, hoping to better our surroundings and our neighbors.  
 \"Nonprofits play a vital role in building a healthy and thriving community,\" Stacy Schiemann, executive director of the United Way of Ashland County, told correspondent Linda Hall for our main story in this special section.  
 They often do this behind the scenes and without the recognition that they truly deserve.  
 This year, we designed our annual Progress Edition to celebrate nonprofit organizations. It's a challenge to choose a theme for the Progress Edition, which is our largest special section of the year in terms of advertising. From a newsroom perspective, the Progress Edition has evolved over the years into a major enterprise reporting effort.  
 The trick is finding a theme that will generate good stories that tell our readers something about our community they likely don't already know. We hope you find that is the case with nonprofits.  
 Earlier this year -- and well before the coronavirus pandemic hit home -- we asked the community to make suggestions and reached out to major nonprofits such as the Ashland County Community Foundation and individuals such as Ashland Mayor Matt Miller for their recommendations.  
 Within this section, you will find profiles on fewer than 20 nonprofits in the county. In other words, there are an overwhelming number of worthwhile organizations not represented on these pages. That doesn't mean they don't deserve to be highlighted by the Times-Gazette. (We even ran into a couple of situations where nonprofits preferred to avoid any publicity and not be showcased.)  
 If you are aware of a nonprofit not featured here that should be, please let us know. Feel free to reach out to me at 419-281-0581 ext. 211 or rarmon@times-gazette.com.  
 Another traditional component of Progress Editions are the profiles -- produced by our advertising department -- of businesses that are advertising in the section. These are local businesses that are making valuable contributions every day in our community. I'd encourage you to spend some time reading these.  
 Enjoy and thanks for reading the Ashland Times-Gazette.

New York, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 26th Mar, 2020 ) :Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred says the American pastime will help the nation recover from the coronavirus pandemic, but only after it becomes safe for sports to resume.
 Yells of "Play Ball" were supposed to signal the start of the 2020 MLB campaign on Thursday before sellout crowds with all 30 teams in action.
 Instead, the stadiums sat empty and silent as Americans stayed home and deaths and infections continued a steady rise nationwide.
 "The one thing I know for sure is baseball will be back," Manfred told ESPN. "Whenever it's safe to play, we'll be back. Our fans will be back.
 "Our players will be back and we will be part of the recovery, the healing in this country, from this particular pandemic." Manfred hopes for a May return and vows "nothing is off the table" when it comes to staging a season, which he admits is unlikely to include a full 162 games per club and could feature a start without spectators in stadiums.
 But he sees MLB's comeback as "a real milestone in the return to normalcy" much as the sport served to help the United States heal after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that also temporarily halted sport.
 "I think you saw it after 9-11 in terms of the resumption of play," Manfred said. "I was there in (New York's) Shea Stadium that night that we began playing -- it was one of the most memorable games I've ever attended.
 "It's an honor for our sport to be regarded in a way that we have been, part of our country coming back from some horrific events. We hope that we can play a similar role with respect to this one.

In our Pressure Cylinders business, net sales were $271 million, down 7% from the prior year quarter. Operating income, excluding impairment, restructuring, and the tank replacement program, was $12 million, down $9 million from the prior year quarter, due to lower volumes in our industrial and consumer products business, partially offset by an improvement in the oil and gas business. Softness in the industrial products business was largely driven by continued weakness in our European operations. In our consumer products business, we believe that volume decreases were a function of strong demand in Q2 and a warm winter, which reduced demand for heating applications. Moving forward, our Pressure Cylinders business has end-market diversity and in past downturns has not seen precipitous decreases in demand across the board. That said, supply chain, operational, or customer disruptions are all possible in the current environment.

Although the trading range stayed wider on the expected lines, the volatility reduced, as India VIX declined further by 7.85 per cent to 71.53. Nifty continuing the pullback or slipping into a broad consolidation zone will depend upon the index’s ability to keep its head above the 8,550 level. The domestic market is likely to see a quiet start, with 8,710 and 8,800 levels acting as resistance. On the lower side, support may come in at 8,550 and 8,365. In the event of any corrective move, the day’s range is expected to remain wider than usual. 74834981 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart stood at 35.74 and marked a fresh 14- period high, which is bullish. The RSI remained neutral, showing no divergence against the price. The daily MACD stayed bearish as it traded below its signal line. However, the downside momentum was decelerating, as evident from the Histogram, which appears to be narrowing its width. Nifty has surged over 1,100 points from the recent lows. However, it is evident from the F&O; data that the pullback has been solely on the back of massive short covering, and this remains a concern. Nifty remains vulnerable at current levels if the short covering is not replaced with fresh buying. There is no doubt that the market has attempted to find a bottom. However, a confirmation is awaited, and that would depend upon Nifty’s ability to keep its head above 8,550 in the near term. Rather than pre-empting the confirmation, we would strongly recommend traders to wait, as a slip below 8,550 will make the market to consolidate in a broad range.

Jack tries valiantly to cover his tracks, but those who know him who what he’s doing. I mean when you’re drinking a beer in the early morning hours in the shower, you have a problem people. What is enjoyable about “The Way Back” is that it’s a slow burn in terms of drama. We don’t see the typical alcohol tale. We know our protagonist has a problem; we seem him slightly on the mend after getting an opportunity to coach a failing basketball team. Jack is given the opportunity to impact lives of young athletes with his knowledge and wisdom, and it takes his mind off drowning his sorrows.

“Things are changing so rapidly that last week, all of a sudden this is paid for,” Ling said. “A couple of doctors here have been using this particular platform for a couple years now to get it up and running. It’s been at least a two-year project, it was ready and sitting there waiting for the insurance side and HIPAA side of things to be approved.
 “This coronavirus outbreak was the impetus for getting this technology approved and moving forward.”
 Ling noted earlier this week, he spent his entire day talking to patients either over the phone or via video over the computer.
 “A lot of our patients are elderly patients who are not necessarily technologically savvy,” Ling said. “The biggest challenge on the patient side is getting their system set up and the steps to get through. It’s not very difficult, but for some older people it may be difficult.”
 Ling said while the technology will not allow for emergency services, trauma or physical exams, it is ideal for medication reviews, counseling and triage functioning.
 “The message I want to get out is your doctors are available,” Ling said. “If you need to interact with your doctor, call the office and they’ll direct you with what’s available.”

GuideStar, an organization that tracks nonprofits around the country, estimates that there are 1.8 million charities and other nonprofit organizations in the United States.  
 TaxExemptWorld, another tracker of nonprofits, estimates that there are 560 in Ashland County, with assets totaling $458 million.  
 These organizations -- all designed to help the community -- focus on everything from education to arts and culture to animals to health to religion. They identify problems, provide solutions and offer assistance where gaps exist.  
 We likely either benefit from one of them or contribute to them, hoping to better our surroundings and our neighbors.  
 "Nonprofits play a vital role in building a healthy and thriving community," Stacy Schiemann, executive director of the United Way of Ashland County, told correspondent Linda Hall for our main story in this special section.  
 They often do this behind the scenes and without the recognition that they truly deserve.  
 This year, we designed our annual Progress Edition to celebrate nonprofit organizations. It's a challenge to choose a theme for the Progress Edition, which is our largest special section of the year in terms of advertising. From a newsroom perspective, the Progress Edition has evolved over the years into a major enterprise reporting effort.  
 The trick is finding a theme that will generate good stories that tell our readers something about our community they likely don't already know. We hope you find that is the case with nonprofits.  
 Earlier this year -- and well before the coronavirus pandemic hit home -- we asked the community to make suggestions and reached out to major nonprofits such as the Ashland County Community Foundation and individuals such as Ashland Mayor Matt Miller for their recommendations.  
 Within this section, you will find profiles on fewer than 20 nonprofits in the county. In other words, there are an overwhelming number of worthwhile organizations not represented on these pages. That doesn't mean they don't deserve to be highlighted by the Times-Gazette. (We even ran into a couple of situations where nonprofits preferred to avoid any publicity and not be showcased.)  
 If you are aware of a nonprofit not featured here that should be, please let us know. Feel free to reach out to me at 419-281-0581 ext. 211 or rarmon@times-gazette.com.  
 Another traditional component of Progress Editions are the profiles -- produced by our advertising department -- of businesses that are advertising in the section. These are local businesses that are making valuable contributions every day in our community. I'd encourage you to spend some time reading these.

Istanbul, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 26th Mar, 2020 ) :Turkey's boxing federation on Thursday slammed organisers of an Olympic qualifying tournament in London after three Turkish fighters and a coach tested positive for the coronavirus.
 The London competition featured around 350 male and female boxers from dozens of European nations and was the first opportunity for boxers from Europe to qualify for Tokyo 2020.
 "The International Olympic Committee Boxing Task Force and the local committee in London \-- responsible for the organisation -- acted as if nothing happened rather than postpone the tournament over coronavirus while every corner of the world has been on fire since December," Eyup Gozgec, president of the Turkish Boxing Federation, told AFP in a phone interview.
 The Boxing Road to Tokyo event started on Saturday March 14 and was scheduled to run until Tuesday Match 24 behind closed doors. But it was suspended after just three days over growing coronavirus fears.
 Gozgec, who is also the vice-president of the European Boxing Confederation, said his team went to London on March 11 to prepare for the tournament but found no protective measures in place at their hotel or elsewhere.
 "There were no protective measures in the hotels we were staying, whether it be hygenic disinfectants, gloves or a warning sign," he told AFP.
 "All the coaches and athletes ate in self-service style from the same kitchen. There was neither a warning nor any other measure as if the virus had not visited there." - 'Failed the test'- Gozgec said one more Turkish athlete tested positive on Thursday after they returned from London, bringing the number to four including one coach.

The City of Aragon took steps this past Monday to ensure that events don't repeat themselves. Pittman ordered all city parks, playgrounds, the mill pond and Pittman Field's walking track closed to the public. The council also joined in approval of a local emergency resolution closing restaurants and bars to public dining-in service, and put in place a measure to ensure there are no gatherings of more than 10 people at a time in one place.
 City hall was also closed, and office staff are now working from home for the time being. Payments for trash service can be made over the phone or online.
 Pittman promised greater control over the ball field in the future as well.
 "When everything gets back to normal, I am going to make sure that all tournaments have to go through the city," she stated.
