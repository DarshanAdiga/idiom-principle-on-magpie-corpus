_Washington, 24 gen 23:44 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Il dipartimento per il Commercio statunitense ha ritirato una norma per limitare la capacità delle aziende Usa di vendere prodotti a Huawei dopo lo stop arrivato dal Pentagono. Lo riferisce "The Hill" che sostiene come il Pentagono abbia espresso preoccupazione per l'effetto che la norma potrebbe avere sulle imprese americane. Il dipartimento del Commercio ha inserito Huawei nella lista nera delle società a maggio, impedendo alle imprese statunitensi di condurre affari con la compagnia a meno che non ottengano una licenza specifica, citando a giustificazione problemi di sicurezza nazionale con riferimento al colosso cinese delle telecomunicazioni. Ma alcune aziende Usa hanno cominciato a trovare soluzioni alternative per aggirare la regola e così continuare a vendere apparecchiature a Huawei senza cadere nella violazione delle sanzioni commerciali.

“I think it’s modeling some of their behaviors on and off the mat,” Ludwig said. “With some of the more successful older guys in the room, we’ve been able to get these guys to the right work ethic. They’re constantly getting better throughout the year and I think that’s what it takes.”
 Wrestlers like redshirt seniors McCoy Kent and Kenny Moore have played their part both in mentoring the younger wrestlers and giving the team value as long-time starters at 149 pounds and 174 pounds respectively.
 Wilson said upperclassmen like Kent and Moore has given the younger guys a better look at what tough competition will look like as they progress in their careers.
 “Those upperclassmen have been on the team for a few years now, and they know what it takes,” Wilson said. “It’s great to get a good look from them as to what we’ll get from competition.”
 The Huskies now have a four-dual road stretch ahead, starting with maybe their toughest competition Saturday against the nationally ranked University of Missouri Tigers. Coach Ludwig said the focus for NIU in their road stretch is to manage their bodies while also being well prepared.
 “It’s all about our preparation, our training, dieting, getting our sleep and focusing on our behaviors,” Ludwig said. “It’s onto Missouri, the returning Mid-American Conference champions, and we want to be as prepared as we can be to wrestle as well as we can. It’s more a focus on preparation and if we can focus on that, everything will take care of itself.”
 Olejnik said managing his body is a main focus for the late stretch of the regular season.
 “We’re just trying to maintain our strength with weight workouts and always working to get better in the wrestling room,” Olejnik said. “We just have to keep wrestling the way we’re wrestling. We want to put on some shows for our fans, make some statements and have fun doing it.”
 The Huskies meet the defending conference champions at 2 p.m. Saturday in Columbia, Missouri. The event will be aired on ESPN3.

ORLEANS -- Casting the clouds aside in his crystal ball Orleans Town Administrator John Kelly peered ahead to 2026, discerning expected town expenditures.
 He was reporting to selectmen last week about capital planning items, and with the sewer construction about to get under way (bid requests will soon be issued) there are multiple big ticket items in the offing. The sewer phases are under town control and others, such as the renovation of Nauset Regional High School, are not.
 Kelly said he wants non-school spending increases to stay under 4 percent (not including debt) for the coming year, and he hopes school increases will stay there as well. Currently the non-school estimated budget is up 4.7 percent but that will be trimmed.
 There is debt falling off the books so the property tax rate might drop slightly (before the sewer tab kicks in) and Orleans should have $1.48 million available in free cash.
 The downtown sewer and treatment plant has an estimated cost of $47,382,800, which was approved at the May 2019 Town Meeting. Orleans is applying for a loan from the State Revolving Fund for wastewater. That could include 10 percent loan forgiveness and zero percent interest.
 That's only the beginning of the sewer work, however. In addition to $1.6 million in adaptive management planning design and construction for 2020 Orleans is looking at $23,184,100 to construct sewers around Meetinghouse Pond in East Orleans in FY2023 as well as assorted planning and design expenses for the work prior to that, adding up to another $1.8 million.
 The town is also planning for close to $33 million in spending on permeable reactive barriers, with $14 million of that slated for FY2026. If the barriers work after testing the town will spend $7.8 million in FY2022 and six figure sums in the following years.
 "There's a lot (of PRB expense) over the next five years," Kelly admitted.
 The barriers are to intercept nitrogen migrating toward Orleans salt water, thus lessening potential sewer costs - although they themselves aren't cheap. The Meetinghouse Pond and PRB portions of sewer spending have yet to be approved at Town Meeting.
 Orleans is still working on a Nauset Beach retreat plan to create parking away from the eroding beach for when the artificial dune is washed away. The town will move beach operations and food services to safer ground. They've slated $5.6 million in 2022 for that along with $400,000 to improve the road into the Hubler property (where parking will be). The retreat plans were pushed back a tad when Orleans opted to build the artificial dunes last year instead of implementing the full retreat.
 Nauset High could be renovated if the funding article passes all four district town meetings this spring. Orleans has budgeted $25.7 million for that in the coming year but all four towns will have to decide on a debt schedule. The expectation is the district will receive about $37 million from the state for the $132 million project.
 Based on this year's enrollment Orleans is responsible for 19.5 percent of the Nauset budget, which could reduce its contribution to the renovation (last year the town contributed 20 percent) but final numbers are still unknown.
 Other projects
 Orleans is looking at $6.5 million or so to repair the Rock Harbor loading dock over 2021 and 2022 in a two-year project. There is also a $3.6 million repair and replacement of the bulkhead at the town landing next to the Goose Hummock Shop.
 The long contemplated Nauset Estuary dredging project is pegged at $3 million by 2022. That awaits permits.
 The Orleans Elementary School needs new windows ($1.6 million in FY2023) and the there are other smaller, less costly tasks there.
 Snow Library will need improvements including a new roof ($700,000 this year) and there are annual maintenance budgets for vehicles, buildings, etc., along with $1.6 million in water department work. Kelly said Orleans will probably do a study of the Snow Library in 2022 that could result in renovation/new construction.
 He said the town capital plan will be discussed Feb. 12, and with the finance committee on Feb. 20. It also was on the Jan. 22 selectmen's agenda (after The Cape Codder's print deadline).

A week into Operation Citadel the Tiger force was badly depleted, with only a handful of operational tanks left in each company. Only superhuman efforts by repair crews, who night after night ventured onto the battlefield to get the damaged tanks working again, kept the Tiger force in action. The tank crews were worn out and exhausted after continuous action. The offensive was fully defeated on 12 July after the Soviets committed their strategic reserves during the Battle of Prokhorovka. In the largest tank engagement of the war, more than 850 Soviet tanks surged forward in huge waves against II SS Panzer Corps. Across a flat open steppe, the brunt of the attack fell on the Leibstandarte’s panzer regiment. With barely 70 tanks and assault guns, including only four Tigers, the regiment fought a desperate action throughout the day, taking on and defeating wave after wave of Soviet tanks. The Tigers’ 88mm cannons gave the Leibstandarte a huge range advantage, allowing Soviet tank brigades to be decimated before they got to within firing range of the German lines. Almost 200 Soviet tanks lay burning in front of the division at the end of the day. One Waffen-SS Tiger commander, Michael Wittmann, established his reputation as one of the war’s best tank commanders during the fighting at Kursk. His kill total by the end of the battle was 30 tanks and 28 anti-tank guns.

The Trump administration may be a mixed bag on deregulation that leaves some conservatives disappointed, but it’s not like the Republicans have fundamentally changed their beliefs about the harm of red tape or the efficiency of the federal bureaucracy. The perceived leniency in criminal- justice reform proposals are a reflection that the past tough-on-crime policies worked so well that they’re probably outdated and no longer needed. The GOP is still, by and large, the party of cops. Trump has made the party’s rhetoric more enthusiastic about “infrastructure” in the most general sense, but this is largely an updated version of the longstanding bipartisan tradition of spending taxpayer money to build big stuff in their districts. Remember Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska and Representative Bud Schuster of Pennsylvania?

The current news across the country has been dotted recently with stories of people having dangerous encounters with coyotes.
 A New Hampshire father killed a coyote with his bare hands after the beast grabbed his two-year-old son by the jacket.
 Earlier that day, the same coyote attacked a 62-year-old woman with her three dogs on their porch.
 Both the man and the woman fought the coyote off and were bitten in the process. Both are being treated for rabies.
 In Ohio, a police officer who was assisting with traffic control on the interstate was attacked and bitten by a coyote. The officer used mace to fend the coyote off, and another officer used his taser during the attack. The coyote was later shot by police to prevent any further attacks.
 In Chicago, a six-year-old boy was hospitalized after being bitten on the head by a coyote outside of a museum, and a man showed up at another hospital on the same day saying that a coyote had attacked him from behind.
 From the 1990's to the mid-2000's, Ohio State University researchers found a 20-fold increase in news reports of "human-coyote conflicts" just in the Chicago metropolitan area alone.
 In our neck of the woods, coyotes are just as abundant as they are everywhere else. In recent years, it has become commonplace to see coyotes even within the city limits of Kewanee. At first the reports were from folks on the edge of town, but now it isn't unusual to hear of coyotes being sighted at Windmont or Liberty Parks.
 By now, most folks are familiar with how to do to discourage coyotes from your property; don't leave pet food outside, keep trash cans secured, don't put meat or bones on the compost pile, etc.
 But suppose you are out walking and turn to discover that you are being followed by a coyote. What should you do?
 First of all, DON'T RUN. Coyotes are predators and running will only encourage their instinct to chase you.
 Secondly, turn to face them and use "hazing tactics".
 Hazing tactics are designed to startle a wild animal and scare them away. Be assured that hazing works on even bigger wild animals than coyotes, such as bears.
 Stand tall and wave your arms up and down in wide arcs at your sides as if you were signalling an airplane to land on a runway and YELL FIERCELY in the lowest tones you can muster. Get mad and let that coyote see it. Take a few stomping steps toward them as you are yelling.
 If there are any rocks or sticks that you can throw at the coyote, do it. Some people carry a personal alarm that emits an ear-piercing shriek for close encounters with coyotes. Others carry a loud whistle or a small tin canister of marbles that can be shaken.
 The idea is to be "large and loud" and in no way look or act like prey.

RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT) - Twenty states, including Virginia, have filed a lawsuit challenging regulation that would allow for blueprints for making 3D-printed guns available online.Right now, anyone with a 3D printer could make their own guns if they had the right blueprints. Attorney General Mark Herring says those weapons would be unregistered and untraceable assault- style weapons that could be difficult to detect. That’s why Virginia is one of 20 states suing to keep those blueprints off the internet, but a local gun expert says prohibiting that information could be violating your rights. A Texas-based company pioneered the idea and the Trump Administration attempted 2018 to make those blueprints available over the internet for anyone to access but faced opposition from the states - now they are trying again. “We have filed suit once against the administration to block it and we’re doing it again,” Herring said. Herring and over 20 other state attorney generals are filing suit against the current administration for the second time to block these files “3D guns are sometimes known as ghost guns because they are virtually untraceable and undetectable even with a metal detector, so they are very dangerous,” Herring said. Herring is worried about where these weapons could end up.“Someone who has access to a commercial 3D printer means that they could print these guns put them out on the streets,” Herring said. Firearms expert Jim Reynolds says information on how to build a traditional firearm is available over the web now.“There are companies that sell parts that are not completely finished, they are partially completed. The ATF does not consider those parts to be a firearm and somebody with basic skills can go in their garage and finish these parts and make a firearm for their own use,” Reynolds said. Not only is finding that information simple, but he says it’s also constitutionally protected.“Communicating that information is constitutionally protected speech. It’s your First Amendment right to be able to transfer that information to somebody and teach them to do that,” Reynolds said. Reynolds says firearms should be used safely and legally, but fears what limitations could be placed on similar information in the future if the blueprints for 3D guns are restricted.“I understand why they think they should but I don’t agree with it because that brings us down a slippery slope,” Reynolds said.“The administration will have an opportunity to tell its side of the story, but we feel confident that this step is not only dangerous and reckless but also illegal and we’ll be successful again,” Herring said. The administration is trying to get around those challenges by transferring the regulation of 3D-printed guns from the State Department to the Department of Commerce.Copyright 2020 WWBT.

Following a new wave of publicity — in which Brignac told a reporter he had touched boys but never for “immoral purposes" — Brignac was indicted last month on a rape charge that could land him behind bars for the rest of his life. The prosecution came more than a year after a former altar boy told police that Brignac repeatedly raped him beginning in the late 1970s. Police said the abuse began when the boy was 7 and continued until he was 11.

After rescuing Nick (Gavin Leatherwood) from Hell, Sabrina (Kiernan Shipka) winds up becoming its queen. However, she finds her reign threatened by the clay prince Caliban (Sam Corlett), and the duo compete in a series of challenges to win the throne. When Sabrina isn't hunting down the items that make up the Unholy Regalia as part of this competition, she's cheering for Baxter High, fighting with her boyfriend, and — oh yeah — facing off with a pagan carnival that wants to sacrifice a virgin to resurrect their god, The Green Man, and slaughter the coven.
 Chilling Adventures of Sabrina Boss the Time Paradox Will Go 'Catastrophically Wrong' in Season 4
 To make matters tricker, the coven can't even fight back, since the Dark Lord (Luke Cook) stopped bestowing their magical gifts upon them after they betrayed him in Season 2. But Zelda (Miranda Otto) has an epiphany and transforms the coven into The Order of Hecate, instructing the young witches and warlocks to begin praying to the goddess of witchcraft and magic, who does restore their powers. Thanks to this — and the fact that Sabrina TIME TRAVELS to undo the apocalypse (more on that below) — they're able to defeat the pagans and save the day. However, Sabrina decides to ignore all the rules of time travel and allows both her past and future selves to live so she can live two lives: one as Queen of Hell and one as a high school student. Plus, there's also that whole cliffhanger where Father Blackwood (Richard Coyle) hatches an eldritch terror that has the potential to destroy the world.

It was the first time Clippers guard Rodney McGruder played against the Heat, the team with whom he spent his first three NBA seasons. "It's nice. It's weird," McGruder said of facing Miami and many of his friends. He was waived by the Heat late last season in a luxury-tax-related move, and picked up by the Clippers -- who signed him to a three-year deal this past summer.

La buena imagen en Copa del Rey y la clasificacion para los octavos de final del torneo del KO, tras vencer de forma contundente al Girona (0-3), deben servir de rampa de lanzamiento para reencontrarse con el triunfo en la Liga. Tras la derrota en La Ceramica ante el colista, el Espanyol, el Villarreal CF es consciente de que debe recuperar su mejor version en la competicion domestica, y que mejor forma de hacerlo que logrando una victoria a domicilio en un estadio siempre complicado como es Mendizorroza, donde los de Javi Calleja se miden esta tarde al Alaves (18.30 horas).
 Ambos contendientes afrontan este atractivo duelo de estilos con objetivos diferenciados, pero con la idea de dar un paso importante en cuanto a temas clasificatorios. Mientras que los vitorianos quiera alejarse del descenso, los amarillos pretenden reengancharse a la zona noble.
 MEJORES SENSACIONES / El Submarino no quiere perder la estela de las plazas europeas, por lo que tras la derrota en casa con el Espanyol del pasado fin de semana, el equipo groguet es consciente de que debe sumar en un campo como Mendizorroza.
 La victoria en Copa del Rey frente al Girona ha hecho que se recuperen las buenas sensaciones de la racha anterior de resultados, por lo que tanto Calleja como sus futbolistas esperan poder reducir el tropiezo frente a Espanyol a solo un accidente.
 IMPORTANTES AUSENCIAS / Sin embargo, la acumulacion de partidos ha provocado que algunos jugadores tengan problemas musculares asi como algunas bajas. Gerard Moreno ya suma dos semanas fuera del equipo y que seguira de baja para este encuentro. A esta ausencia del goleador barcelones se suma la del defensa Pau Francisco Torres, que con una microrrotura en el recto anterior de su pierna derecha, estara fuera de las convocatorias como minimo un mes.
 Es, por tanto, turno para que Javi Calleja recomponga las piezas de un Submarino que no puede permitirse mas errores si quiere escalar posiciones. Respecto al posible once para este partido, parece claro que el tecnico dara entrada a los jugadores que descansaron o jugaron poco el pasado miercoles en Girona.
 BACCA Y EL SEGUNDO CENTRAL / Todo a punta a que Bacca ejercera de '9', mientras que la principal incognita es saber si acompañara a Albiol en el eje de la zaga, para cubrir la baja de Pau, Funes Mori o recolocara a Mario, dando entrada a Ruben Peña. Por ello, el posible once podria estar formado por Sergio Asenjo en la porteria, acompañado en defensa por Mario (o Ruben Peña si el noveldense es central), Raul Albiol, Funes Mori y Alberto Moreno.
 Si finalmente se decanta por el central argentino, se trataria de su primera titularidad en Liga.
 En el centro del campo, estaran otra vez Vicente Iborra, Zambo Anguissa y Manu Trigueros, fijos de hace algunas semanas. Mientras que en ataque Cazorla y Chukwueze se moverian por los extremos, aunque el tecnico puede barajar la opcion de apostar por Moi Gomez en vez del asturiano, mientras que la referencia en ataque corresponderia al colombiano Carlos Bacca.
