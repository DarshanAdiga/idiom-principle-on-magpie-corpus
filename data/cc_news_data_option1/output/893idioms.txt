Over the past year, Patz has sent threatening messages through social media to numerous professional athletes, investigators said. After losing $10,000 by betting on the Los Angeles Rams to win last year's Super Bowl, Patz sent messages to two players on the game's winning team, the New England Patriots, claiming that he would rape and murder their families, the indictment said.
 The complaint also lists threats against players for the Atlanta Braves, the San Diego Padres, the Oakland Athletics, the Cleveland Indians, the Baltimore Orioles and the Kansas City Royals. One of Patz's accounts also threatened a player for the Swedish women's soccer team after they beat Germany in the Women's World Cup Quarter-Final, instigators said.
 U.S. Attorney's Office spokeswoman Amy Filjones said Patz was charged in Florida's Middle District because the Rays players were there when the threats were made. It wasn't immediately clear if Patz would face charges in other districts for the other threats.
 Patz had arranged to turn himself in but wasn't yet in custody Wednesday evening, Filjones said. It wasn't known if he had an attorney.
 Rays spokesman Dave Haller said the team didn't immediately have a comment about the case.

UW will have a similar capacity up and running soon, and the state has asked labs across the state to be prepared to process coronavirus tests as well.

“We didn’t have the most athletic kids or none of that; we just knew exactly what we needed to do,” Sharnesha said. “You had kids that came every single day and worked hard. Even as a freshman, I remember being challenged every single day; not just by my sister, but other girls that didn’t go on to play college basketball, but they had a goal in mind.
 “We knew we wanted to be a part of something, and we just came together and made it happen. To fall short, that was a heartbreaking thing, but we learned so much about each other during that whole season. It was great.”
 Shayla went on to play four years at UCF, where her name can still be found among the program’s all-time leaders in assists and 3-pointers. A few years later, Sharnesha closed out her Camden career as the record holder for assists and steals before committing to Stetson, where she became one of just 11 players in program history to tally at least 1,000 points and 250 assists.
 Still looking to be a part of the game, Sharnesha joined the coaching ranks when her playing career came to an end, serving two years at Augusta State and three years at Flagler before getting her first shot as a head coach at Glynn Academy ahead of the 2017-18 season.
 “I got the experience of being an assistant at Division II for five years, I had two different college jobs, I played Division I basketball,” Sharnesha said. “The lessons I learned as a player, and then as an assistant, picking up on some things and then learning from those head coaches…
 “You never feel that you’re ready to step in, but with the support system that I have, I had a lot of people, mentors, and other colleagues that are coaching now were telling me, ‘You’re ready. You’ve got to step out there. People need to know that you’re beneficial. You have a lot to prove to people,’ and then of course to impact our young ladies today. So I thought about it, and then I applied, and then I got the job as soon as I applied. So this is where I am. It’s been three years, and we’ve had an unbelievable run.”
 Glynn Academy has also provided Shayla with her first coaching experience of any kind outside of summer ball. Shayla served as a community coach for the Terrors the past two seasons before fully dedicating herself to the job this year as a coach and in the school system.
 In the Smiths’ first year, Glynn Academy went 14-13, dropping back-to-back games in the region championship game and the first round of the state playoffs to end the season. In the second, the Terrors improved to 26-5, won their first region title since 1995, and advanced to the quarterfinal round in the postseason.
 Now, Glynn Academy is just one win away from capturing the first state championship in the history of the girls basketball program, and Sharnesha credits her team’s success to all the players and coaches that came before.
 “The success in the program, that goes back to the foundation that was laid even before I got here,” Sharnesha said. “This is for all those girls that gave everything they had to this program, past and present. That’s what it’s about for us.”
 The Terrors have been on a warpath over the last two months, winning 14 straight games since the calendar flipped to 2020, including four playoff games by an average margin of just under 21 points per contest.
 It’s truly been a historic season for Glynn Academy, one that is certain to be remembered, win or lose Saturday against an equally-dominant Forest Park. But if Ellis has learned anything from his storied career, it’s been to take advantage of these kind of moments because you’re not guaranteed to get another.
 “If I had to give a message to them it’d be, ‘win it,’ because you never know when you’re going to get back,” Ellis said. “We had some great teams where we went to the Elite 8, and your teams are rolling. We had a 2007 team that made it to the Elite 8, but we never got back to that opportunity to get to that championship.
 “So my message to them is to win it now.”
 As former players of Ellis, it’s no shock Sharnesha and Shayla have the same mindset.
 “With this unbelievable senior class that we have, I tell them all the time, ‘This is your final week of practice, this is your final week of preparation, this is your final opportunity. You’ll never play in a state championship ever again, so what are you going to do? How do you want your journey to end? What’s your story? What do you want people to say about you?’” Sharnesha said. “We’ve been preaching that all season long, you’re in control of your own destiny. Are you giving it all you got? That’s kind of been the spiel this whole playoff run…
 “I always keep that in their minds, you’ve got to take advantage of every opportunity. You don’t take any opportunity for granted.”
 Shayla added: “I always tell them, you never know when you’re going to get it again. Some of these girls, the only opportunity you’re going to have to go to another Final Four is if you end up in one of those big Power 5 conferences in college and have that opportunity.
 “I was like, ‘Live in the moment. Don’t think ahead. We’re just one game away. It’s only one game, leave it all on the floor.’”

Like elsewhere, Democratic voters in Texas were driven by beating Trump, with more than 8 in 10 voters saying they considered it highly important, according to an AP VoteCast survey. But it's in the Texas Capitol where Democrats feel they have their best shot, needing just nine seats to claim a majority in the House chamber for the first time since 2001.
 The stakes to win control of statehouses is high across the country, with the ability to redraw voting maps next year on the line in November.
 State Rep. Celia Israel, who is leading the efforts by Texas House Democrats to flip the chamber next year, expressed optimism Wednesday that the national party and presidential nominee would spend money this year to boost candidates further down on the ballot.
 “The message I'm getting is they're not going to gloss over Texas like they have in the past," she said. “They're not just going to come and drag the bag, fill it with money and take that money to the Midwest."
 Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak, who also suspects the GOP is facing a rare but real threat in the Texas Capitol, doesn't see it.
 “Trump is going to win Texas," he said. “There's going to be a lot more other places where they need to deploy resources."

Last month my wife and I went to see the movie "1917." We understood that it was a good World War I story, with excellent cinematography. We were correct on both counts.
 What we didn't expect is that it would trigger memories from my tour of duty in Vietnam. I just never know when something lurking in the dark recesses of my mind will resurface, especially from that seminal time in my life.
 After the movie ended, as I sat in the rear of the theater regaining my composure and waiting for everyone else to leave, I realized that God gave me all I could handle back in 1970/1971 - no more and no less. With my wife sitting there beside me, I simply felt grateful to have survived myself and the war.
 The experience prompted me to write about Valentines Day 1971 in my February Food for Thought piece. Like other special days back on the home front, Valentines Day in the city of Qui Nhon was just another day in the 'Nam.
 I was one of the fortunate ones, blessed to come home in good health, raise a family and enjoy grandchildren. Others were not so lucky - so many sacrificed their lives and limbs.
 Although 1971 was towards the end of the war, the number of Americans killed or wounded in action that year was greater than in 1965, the first year of ground combat for U.S. infantry units.
 In the city of Qui Nhon, Operation Keystone - U.S. troop reduction and withdrawal - had begun. The more our military presence diminished, the more dangerous the city became.
 In that environment, despite having a wife and four little ones at home, I was more concerned with proving my courage than playing it safe. What was I thinking?
 Fortunately, God had other plans for me. I swear His hand reached down into the quagmire that was Qui Nhon and kept me safe from harm.
 He protected my body, but my mind was another thing entirely. The adrenaline rush experienced as a Military Police duty officer impacted me for years after the war, as did the survivor guilt which ate away at my soul. Now, in my 70s, I am finally at peace thanks to my loving wife and family, our Vet to Vet sessions at the Brockton VA and my association with a group of Plymouth Vietnam veterans and their Welcome Home Huey Helicopter float.
 I share this with you for two reasons. First, I'm quite sure my experience is not dissimilar to many of my comrades who returned home to an ungrateful nation after the war. Vietnam Veterans Day is celebrated on March 29th and my hope is that you will take some time this month to reflect upon their honorable service, during such a turbulent time in our nation's history.
 Second - there will be a fundraiser on April 25 at VFW Post 1822, located on 22 Seven Hills Road in Plymouth, to help our ad hoc Vietnam veterans group make repairs to our Huey Helicopter float. The Huey is the iconic symbol of the Vietnam War. Our float has been well received at parades and static displays throughout the South Shore for a number of years, but is now in need of an upgrade, particularly with Plymouth's 400th celebration just around the corner.
 The Northern Poker League will conduct a Texas Hold 'Em tournament at the Plymouth VFW on April 25. There will be a 1st, 2nd, 3rd and high hand pay out, plus a 50/50 raffle and a silent auction. Light refreshments will be served with a pay as you go bar. A good time should be had by all. Hope to see you there.
 Despite being in the middle of repairs to our Huey, we are being pressed into service once again on March 15, when we'll be marching in Scituate's St. Patrick's Day Parade. It would be great to see you on the Irish Riviera. Happy St. Patrick's Day!

Athletic directors for two of the state's Division I universities cautioned lawmakers Wednesday about the perils of a nationwide march toward paying college sports stars.
   
 Jeff Long, of the University of Kansas, and Gene Taylor, of Kansas State University, testified before a Senate panel considering a proposal that would allow student athletes to receive compensation from their name, image and likeness.
   
 Long and Taylor offered cautious support for the plan, which levels the playing field if other states unlock restrictions. The proposed legislation requires 15 other states to pass similar measures before athletes at Kansas colleges and universities would be free to negotiate deals.
   
 California already has given a green light to compensation for name, image and likeness.
   
 Long said the California model, which takes effect in 2023, alters the landscape of college sports and places other states at a disadvantage. Kansas universities need to compete, he said, but can't lose focus of the services they provide to students who won't make the cut as professional athletes.
   
 "We're keeping that base educational core for that 98% who don't have a name, image and likeness they can sell," Long said, "so they still have their tuition, room, board, books and fees and get to compete for the Jayhawks and love the experience and learn from all those wonderful things that athletics teaches people. That's where we're focused."
   
 Taylor said K-State will have to invest more resources into investigating relationships between athletes and agents to ensure the school is complying with NCAA rules.
   
 He expressed concern that the Kansas law could take effect quickly because 30 states already are considering similar legislation. He asked lawmakers to hold off on adopting legislation until next year, when a coalition of colleges will produce their own proposal.
   
 "Just allow us some time," Taylor said. "If we come up with something and then states still don't agree with it, they have the opportunity to move forward with their legislation."
   
 Emporia State University president Allison Garrett also testified in support of the proposal in front of the Senate Commerce Committee while highlighting a number of concerns.
   
 The monitoring of deals arranged between athletes and other interests will be "a very complex area," she said. She asked for assurance that the new model won't be used to incentive recruiting. And like her peers at bigger universities, she wants to avoid turning college athletes into employees.
   
 Garrett said it would be better to have congress provide a single, nationwide standard.
   
 Matt Lindsey, president of the Kansas Independent College Association, said schools in his organization are worried about conflicts with their values.
   
 The legislation would allow college athletes at faith-based schools to allow their image to be used in marketing campaigns that tolerate premarital sex or promote the sale of alcohol, he said.
   
 He proposed installing a way for independent schools to opt out of the compensation plan or veto third-party contracts.

It's been almost two decades since actor Steve Coogan and director Michael Winterbottom - both Brits - first teamed up to make the eccentric, based-on- fact comedy "24 Party People," in which Coogan starred as music entrepreneur Tony Wilson. Though both men have had stellar careers on their own - a glance at their resumes on IMDB.com is quite impressive - something just clicks when they work together. (Check out "Tristram Shandy" or any of their films in the "Trip" series.)      With "Greed," Winterbottom has written and directed a sharp, smart, and biting satire that takes serious issues, turns them on their heads by infusing a dark comedic element, and provides an opportunity for Coogan to sink his teeth into the role of a despicable individual who it's fun to root against.      He plays Sir Richard McCreadie, a successful, ridiculously wealthy British fashion industry businessman who is facing two major milestones. He's about to turn 60, and he realizes he needs to do something about his well-earned and extremely tarnished public image. How about throwing a big party in his own honor? How about making it a huge party? Let's build a seaside amphitheater in Greece and recreate some gladiator games - a lion in a cage would be a nice touch - and invite everyone he knows that he wants to impress, and pepper the crowd with celebrities, or at least celebrity lookalikes. Well, now, that should celebrate 60 with style and make everyone think that he's a good guy, not a jerk.      The problem is that he is, indeed, a jerk. That's made clear from how he makes demands of and talks down to the men who are constructing his amphitheater. It's shown that he insists on always having his way and is used to ordering people around. A flashback to a courtroom hearing concerning his business practices a few months earlier has him being rude and smarmy to his questioners. Asked about his possibly illegal history of opening businesses that soon go out of business, he dismisses the accusation with "I'm an entrepreneur. I take risks." Flashing back further to his early days in clothing retail, he's seen as a stubborn, hard-driving dealmaker who is full of himself. Going back even further in time, to his school days, it's no surprise to discover that he was a jerk then, too.      Everything is seen through the eyes of this terrible man, as well as through those of two other characters - his unhappy assistant Amanda (Dinita Gohil), who knows all of his nasty tricks, and his easily flustered official biographer Nick (David Mitchell) who, after checking into McCreadie's past and interviewing former employees, is beginning to get a picture of just how awful this guy is.      Yet, jumping all over the place in locations and time, and featuring an oddball cast of characters - his control freak mom (Shirley Henderson) is very protective of him; his ex-wife (Isla Fisher) loves money more than he does - the film is quite funny, often looking at the absurdities surrounding McCreadie. For instance, it brutally and comically bursts the bubble of TV reality shows. One frustrated "contestant" on an episode being filmed near the partially built amphitheater blurts out, "I forgot my line!"      The film moves along at a breezy clip, but slowly, almost imperceptibly, grows darker. Not just concerning problems with the impending party - construction grinds to a halt, guests start sending in regrets - but also in addressing issues of racism, rampant capitalism and resulting wealth inequality. Don't worry, the party does happen, but it morphs into a sort of bad dream, with threats of it turning into a nightmare. And it's still darkly funny! "Greed" gives us another great Coogan performance and another complete original from Winterbottom.      Ed Symkus writes about movies for More Content Now. He can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

Booker Prize-winning author Anne Enright comes to the Music Hall Loft, 131 Congress St., as part of the Writers in the Loft series at 7 p.m. Wednesday, March 11.
 Enright will share details about her new novel, “Actress,” a mother-daughter love story and a wry valentine to the theatrical life, from small-town Ireland to Broadway and then Hollywood.
 Enright conjures two generations of women with difficult sexual histories, both assaulted and silenced, both finding — or failing to find — their powers of recovery.
 Norah O’Dell’s mother Katherine is a brilliant theater legend and a hopelessly needy and evasive parent. As she sorts through her mother’s belongings, Norah, now middle-aged, conjures scenes from her mother’s tragicomic life.
 Born into a theater family, Katherine O’Dell ascends from Ireland’s version of the bus-and-truck circuit, to London’s West End to a brief stint in Hollywood as a Maureen O’Hara-like Irish rose.
 Every moment of Katherine’s life is a performance, with young Norah standing at the wings. With age, alcohol, and dimming stardom, Katherine’s grip on reality grows fitful and fueled by an interior monologue that reads like a casting-couch nightmare as told by Molly Bloom, Katherine ultimately commits the crime of shooting a pompous agent in the foot.
 As her role changes to Katherine’s protector, caregiver, and finally legacy- keeper, Norah comes to understand her mother’s fierce commitment to the love that binds an actress and her audience.
 The upcoming program will include a presentation and an onstage interview with Kristen Bulger, digital marketing associate at The Music Hall, followed by a Q&A and post-event book signing and meet-and-greet.
 Tickets are $41, which includes a copy of "Actress" and a bar beverage. For information, visit themusichall.org or call 436-2400.
 Enright, who lives and works in Dublin, has published three volumes of stories, one book of nonfiction and five novels. In 2015, she was named the inaugural Laureate for Irish Fiction.
 Enright’s novel “The Gathering” won the Man Booker Prize and “The Forgotten Waltz” garnered her the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction.

Every five years, Steve Deller, UW-Extension community development economist and professor in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at UW–Madison, updates his study, "Contribution of Agriculture to the Wisconsin Economy."
 In the five years since results from the last study were released, the contribution to Wisconsin's economy generated by farms and agricultural businesses jumped from $88.3 billion to $104.8 billion, and the number of jobs in agriculture jumped from 413,500 to 437,700.
 "There is always a demand for agriculture," Chippewa Valley Technical College President Bruce Barker said Wednesday during the Wisconsin Technical College System's National Ag Day 2020 celebration at CVTC's Energy Education Center. "For anyone looking at an ag career, there is a future there. Today's agriculture is high-tech, it's nutrition, it's science, it's production. It's big business."
 About 300 area high school agriculture students took part in CVTC's Ag Skills Competition Wednesday at the Energy Education Center, where teams and individuals tested their knowledge and skills with activities like identifying ag equipment and distinguishing between different types of animal rations and plants.
 During a break in the competition, the students listened to speeches from agriculture industry representatives including the state's 72nd Alice in Dairyland Abigail Martin; Wisconsin FFA officers Curtis Weltzien, Daniel Clark and Joe Schlies; Wisconsin Farm Technology Days board member Mel Pittman; and Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection interim Secretary Randy Romanski.
 Becky Levzow, president of the Wisconsin Technical College System Board and a dairy farmer in Columbia County, said there are numerous opportunities for students looking to pursue a career in agriculture. Levzow said within a 10-mile radius of her farm she has counted at least 28 ag-related businesses including produce stands, wedding barns, wineries wind turbines and ethanol plants.
 "You get an idea of how important agriculture and these businesses are to our county and state economy," Levzow said. "They provide a strong and diverse group of occupations for agriculture."
 Romanski said one in nine people working in the state of Wisconsin holds a job relating to agriculture. The southeastern part of the state, including Milwaukee, is a big part of that, he said, with a number of production, processing and manufacturing jobs.
 "Agriculture touches every part of our state," he said. "There's opportunities everywhere."
 Wisconsin’s technical colleges offer about 60 degree and certificate programs in agriculture, food and natural resources, and the number of degrees handed out in those fields has nearly doubled in the past 10 years.
 "This is the next generation of agriculture in Wisconsin, so we need to support that," Romanski said. "There's opportunity in agriculture, no matter what path students choose."
 Despite well-documented struggles in the agriculture industry in recent years, Romanski said students can feel confident in the industry's future.
 "There's no question the last few years have been a challenge for agriculture," Romanski said. "But there's optimism for the years ahead. Prices seem to be rebounding. There are trade agreements that hopefully mean more Wisconsin products are getting out onto the international marketplace. It's important that we continue to invest in the future of agriculture.
 "Students talk to their friends, family and neighbors, and they know there are some challenges out there in agriculture right now. But it's important that they see there's something down the road, and we're starting to see some good things happen."
 Tessa Pilgrim, who grew up on a dairy farm near Boyd, is in her second year at CVTC studying animal science management and will graduate in May. Pilgrim is hoping to find work as a herd manager or calf specialist after graduation. She said her time at CVTC has given her the experience of working with cows and calves on different farms, and in some cases those farms are looking for herd managers.
 "I grew up on a small dairy farm and have worked on a couple different farms, so I know what's going on out there," Pilgrim said. "I want to be able to work hands-on with the animals but not necessarily on my own farm. This has given me the opportunity to go see what else there actually is out there."

I performed at the bone marrow transplant conference across the country two years in a row so my audience was primarily people who've actually had a transplant, possibly different cancers, some of them incurable, and I've had a number of people come up and go "You know, I try to _forget_ I have cancer. Why would you do this?" [laughs] but they [also] say "Thank you, it was wonderful." I notice that there is at least one place in every show where the emotion, the vulnerability comes forth. It can be in different places, and it becomes this way of connecting with the audience that's so beautiful, and I can feel the energy going back and forth. At the end of the show, a woman came up to me in Santa Cruz and said, "I cared for my mother and there was a lot of issues between us. I had all this guilt and I just feel resolved after your show." and she broke down crying.

In piu occasioni, in una settimana, partendo dalla prima seduta di insediamento dell'assemblea legislativa, il 28 febbraio scorso, gia all'interno di una decretata emergenza, all'interno del luogo dove le leggi regionali e decreti nascono e vengono approvati (compreso il primo relativo al Coronavirus, scritto in tandem con il governo che con l'emergenza diventata nazionale e diventato unico titolare), quelle stesse norme (o cosiddette buona prassi tese al prevenire e contrastare la diffusione del coronavorus), sono state disattese. Elementi tornati alla mente, con preoccupazione, alla notizia, giunta come un fulmine a ciel sereno in assemblea legislativa, che l'Assessore alla sanita Raffaele Donini, che proprio qualche ora prima si era passato un microfono a clip di mano in mano con i giornalisti intervenuti alla conferenza stampa per aggiornare sulla diffusione del virus, era risultato positivo al tampone, cosi come la neo-assessore Barbara Lori. Due assessori regionali, du cui uno alla sanita, colpiti dal contagio. Cosa che ha fatto sbottare, oltre a diversi giornalisti presenti all'incontro ravvicinato in sala stampa con Donini, dove non era stata adottata nessuna precauzione e piu di un consigliere. 'Abbiamo avuto tutti contatti con loro' - afferma un eletto.   L'ex sindaco di Felino, new entry nella giunta di Stefano Bonaccini, e' stata trovata positiva al coronavirus insieme al 'vicino di banco' in giunta Raffaele Donini, risultato tra i contagiati. E la comunicazione arrivata a tutti i dipendenti dal direttore dell'assemblea Leonardo Draghetti ha per forza di cose riproposto il tema della seduta di Assemblea legislativa di venerdi' 28, gia' oggetto di un braccio di ferro tra il presidente della Regione Stefano Bonaccini e la ora ex presidente dell'Assemblea Simonetta Saliera, secondo la quale quella seduta in piena emergenza non era opportuna.      Perche' quel giorno, nella seduta a porte chiuse, a emergenza conclamata e con il decreto del 23 febbraio in vigore, e successo un po di tutto di cio che non doveva succedere. Parecchi consiglieri di tutte le parti politiche si sono felicitati con Lori, Donini e altri. Bonaccini ha baciato e stretto la nuova presidente, che a sua volta ha stretto le mani a tutto il tavolo della presidenza. Nessuna remora, nessuna di quelle cautele richiamate dal governo a dalla stessa Regione. Come se quell'aula fosse zona franca, che in realta non era. Tanto piu nella buvette del parlamentino regionale, dove c'erano collaboratori, giornalisti, qualche 'sponsor' politico. Dove baci, abbracci e strette di mano, vista la rilevanza politica del momento, non sono mancati. Gli inviti a ridurre i contatti, emanati anche dalla Regione e spinti al punto da vietare l'accesso al pubblico, li, paradossalmente, non erano conteplato. Un atteggiamento che e continuato nei giorni successivi nel modo in cui sono state gestite, a porte molto aperte, le conferenze stampa a distanza ravvicinata (pur essendo trasmesse in diretta via web) con gli assessori alla sanita Venturi e, negli ultimi giorni dopo il passaggio del 28 febbraio, del suo successore Donini. Protagonista ieri, immaginiamo non per sua volonta, di un gesto che fuori sarebbe stato condannato e quantomeno evitato. Il ripetuto e continuo passaggio di mano in mano, di un unico microfono, portato di volta in volta a pochi centimetri dalla bocca, tra lui e i giornalisti intervenuti. Una scena ricordata oggi con preoccupazione da molti presenti, una volta informati del contagio dell'assessore.      Ed anche alla luce di quanto successo ci sarebbe sul tavolo regionale l'ipotesi di rinviare anche la prossima seduta dell'assemblea. Una decisione che spettra alla neo presidente valutare e decidere

The recent postponement of GDC and other community and developer events due to concerns about the ongoing Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak led some to wonder whether E3, which is scheduled for June, could also be halted. The Entertainment Software Association, which organizes E3, said earlier this week that it was "moving full speed ahead" with planning for the show despite the concerns.
 But today the city of Los Angeles declared a state of emergency, prompting the ESA to release an updated statement saying that it is continuing to monitor the situation.
 "The health and safety of our attendees, exhibitors, partners, and staff is our top priority. While the ESA continues to plan for a safe and successful E3 show June 9-11, 2020—we are monitoring and evaluating the situation daily," the ESA said.
 "Our E3 team and partners continue to monitor Covid-19 via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). We are actively assessing the latest information and will continue to develop measures to further reduce health risks at the show."
 LA's coronavirus website states that there are only a few known cases in the region, and the ESA clarified, as did Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti earlier today, that the declaration of local emergency "allows the city and county to qualify for additional funding needed to prepare for Covid-19 in the future, if such funds are needed at all." The city is currently emphasizing "healthy hygiene practices," including regularly washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands, and also recommends having "extra food, water, medical supplies, and emergency kits," although given how prone the area is to earthquakes that's probably a good idea anyway.
 E3 is still three months away, which is lots of time for things to change, but the statement bears a strong resemblance to those released by GDC prior to its decision to pull the plug. If the coronavirus continues unabated through April and into May, it's very possible that the ESA will be forced to make the same decision.

The Washington state primary is March 10. Meanwhile, Pete Buttigieg canceled his campaign on March 1. Had I voted for Buttigieg, my vote would have been thrown away. There were 13 people on the ballot when it was mailed it to me, but by March 10, most had dropped out of the race.
 Now, after Super Tuesday, two thirds of the country still will have not voted, while candidates are dropping like flies. This is a ridiculous system where most people don’t get to support their candidates.

A 79-year-old Londonderry man recently acquitted in a child sexual abuse case is trying to move on and rebuild his life, according to his defense attorney.
 A jury in Rockingham County found Anthony Donovan not guilty of nine counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault and two counts of prostitution that alleged he had offered a girl money in exchange for sexual acts.
 “It’s going to take him a while to put his life back together. He lost his job when this happened. He lost friends. He lost relationships. Being accused of something like this takes a great deal of time to overcome,” William Korman, his Boston lawyer, said Wednesday.
 Donovan was arrested early last year on charges that he had sexually assaulted a girl younger than 16 on multiple occasions beginning in 2012.
 Donovan testified in his own defense during the January trial in Rockingham County Superior Court.
 “Mr. Donovan maintained his innocence from the moment he was questioned by police ... and once he took the witness stand he continued to maintain his innocence. We’re over the moon that the jury believed that the state didn’t prove their case. Mr. Donovan was found not guilty because he was, in fact, not guilty,” Korman said.
 But the acquittal was disappointing to Rockingham County Attorney Patricia Conway and former Deputy County Attorney Jennifer Haggar, who prosecuted the case.
 “Although we certainly respect the jury and the criminal justice process, the outcome was not what we expected,” Conway said.
 Conway said that, in general, child sexual assault cases are difficult to prove because “perpetrators rape their victims behind closed doors where no one else can witness the abuse.”
 She said it becomes a case of the alleged perpetrator’s word against the child’s word.
 “It is difficult for the average person to believe that another human being could be capable of harming a child in such a horrible and violent manner ... Quite frankly, it’s easier to believe that the child is dishonest or imagining the abuse,” Conway said.
 She added that children who are vulnerable are often targeted and that child and adult victims generally don’t disclose the abuse right away.
 “This can be difficult for the average person to understand. Victims of sexual abuse do not disclose for a number of reasons, to include the severe emotional trauma inflicted upon the victim by his/her abuser, fear of retaliation and the feelings of embarrassment and humiliation,” Conway said.
