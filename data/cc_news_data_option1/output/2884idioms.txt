“What is happening now in Portland should concern everyone in the United States,” said Jann Carson, interim executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, which successfully sued local police over the use of tear gas to disrupt protests. “Usually when we see people in unmarked cars forcibly grab someone off the street we call it kidnapping. The actions of the militarized federal officers are flat-out unconstitutional and will not go unanswered.”
 Carson argued that “under the direction of the Trump administration, militarized federal agents have flouted court orders protecting the rights of protesters, used sharpshooters to deliberately maim people, and deployed indiscriminate weapons of war — including sonic weapons and dangerous tear gas formulations.”
 Portland has been marked by demonstrations for weeks, sometimes involving tense standoffs between protesters and police. And authorities there have struggled to keep the peace — the ACLU won an injunction after police allegedly targeted journalists and legal observers. But Oregon Gov. Kate Brown joined other state and local officials in denouncing the federal actions, arguing that the federal agents had made the situation worse and have acted as provocateurs.
 “Trump is looking for a confrontation in Oregon in the hopes of winning political points in Ohio or Iowa,” she said.
 The LA Times editorial board warned this month that the nation is facing a potentially dangerous period in the Trump administration, as the flailing president sees his political support flagging. The only way he knows how to campaign is through disruption, destruction of norms, and exploiting racial, regional and class divides.
 Add to that strong-arm tactics and deploying federal agents to patrol city streets — not their job and against the wishes of local officials — and apparently willy-nilly violating the constitutional rights of people they encounter.
 Perversely, Trump’s actions play into the dystopian fantasies of Second Amendment hard-liners and “boogaloos” who say they need their weapons to defend against a tyrannical government.
 I’m not sure how many political points such egregious behavior scores for Trump “in Ohio or Iowa,” because even conservatives — in fact, especially conservatives — should blanch over this blatant misuse of government power.

A Delhi court on Wednesday sentenced Sonu Punjaban to 24 years imprisonment for immoral trafficking of a 12-year old girl, saying a person who does such horrific and terrible acts has no right to live in a civilized society. Additional Sessions Judge Pritam Singh sentenced Geeta Arora alias Sonu Punjaban to jail terms of 14 years for offenses under the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act and 10 years for other offenses under the Indian Penal Code, including selling and buying of a minor girl for prostitution and criminal conspiracy, which will run separately. ldquoThe convict Geeta Arora alias Sonu Punjaban shall first undergo 14 years rigorous imprisonment for offense under sections of Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, thereafter to undergo 10 years rigorous imprisonment for offenses under sections 366A procuration of minor girl, 372 selling minor for purpose of prostitution, 373 buying minor for purpose of prostitution, 328 causing hurt by means of poison, 342 wrongful confinement, 120B criminal conspiracy of IPC. ldquoHence, the convict shall remain in custody jail for a total of 24 years as substantive sentence,rdquo the court said. The court also sentenced co-accused Sandeep Bedwal to 20 years rigorous imprisonment for kidnapping, raping and selling the minor girl for prostitution. It added that Bedwal shall undergo 10 years rigorous imprisonment for offence under section 363 kidnapping, 366 kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, 366A, 372, 120B of IPC and thereafter, he will undergo 10 years rigorous imprisonment for commission of offense under section 376 rape IPC. ldquoHence, the convict Sandeep Bedwal shall remain in custody jail for a total period of 20 years as substantive sentence,rdquo the court said. The court further imposed fines of Rs 64,000 and Rs 65,000 on Punjaban and Bedwal, respectively. It also directed the Delhi Legal Services Authority to pay a compensation of Rs 7 lakh to the girl. ldquoIt is well known that the victim of sexual offenses not only faces mental and physical trauma but also subjected to social stigma and in most cases, they have to change their residence which also causes financial losses to the victim or her family,rdquo it said in its order. The court said that children were the future of a country and the future of a country depended on how it treated its children. In India, thousands of children are kidnapped every year. Very few of them are recovered. Minor girls are kidnapped on the pretext of marriage to be sold in the flesh trade industry where they are sexually exploited on a daily basis. The subject case was also one of those cases where a minor innocent girl was trapped in the name of love and kidnapped in a pre-planned manner to force her into flesh trade, the court said. It further said that Punjaban had not only purchased the victim for prostitution but also brutalized her to make her surrender to her demands and had forcibly administered drugs to her. ldquoThe modesty of a woman is next to her soul. How a woman can outrage and brutalize the modesty of another woman, who is minor, in such a horrific way. The shameful deeds of convict Punjaban deprived her of any leniency from the courts. ldquoA person, irrespective of gender, who does such horrific and terrible acts, has no right to live in civilized society and for her the best place to live is the four boundaries of the jail. Punjaban crossed all the limits to be called a woman and deserved the severest punishment provided under the law,rdquo the court noted. The court had on July 16 convicted Punjaban for the offenses under IPC sections 366A, 372, 373, 328, 370, 342, 120B, and relevant sections of the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act. It had also convicted Bedwal under sections 363, 366, 366A, 372, 120B, 376, and 370 buying or disposing of any person as a slave of IPC. According to the prosecution, Bedwal had kidnapped the minor girl in 2009 on the pretext of marriage and raped her. After that he sold her to a woman who forced the victim for prostitution and even gave drugs to her, the complaint said. It further said that the girl was then sold several times to different people for the purpose of prostitution. Finally, in 2014, she managed to escape from the house of a man who had bought her and married her. She went to a police station and on her statement, the FIR was registered. During the trial, Punjaban and Bedwal had claimed they were falsely implicated in the case.

Advertising                  In the absence of discussions, the proposed motions in the meeting have been postponed to the next meeting.

At the corporation office, 249 persons, including a large number of councillors, had undergone the test, and the results were all negative. However, five out of the 201 persons tested at Puthiyara turned positive for the infection. Corporation Secretary Binu Francis said they were all primary contacts of a person who had tested positive earlier. Puthiyara is one of the 16 containment zones in the city. The remaining councillors underwent the test on Wednesday.

For drownings that occur in public pools or at beaches, lifeguards usually have access to a bag-valve mask or positive-pressure ventilator, with special HEPA or N95 filters. These devices force air into the breathing passages and avoid the need for direct mouth-to-mouth contact.
 “Although it’s OK for family members to do, physical mouth-to-mouth is no longer encouraged,” says Thomas Gill, vice president of the United States Lifesaving Association. “It’s not something recommended for the person on the street if you see a stranger lying there.”
 Drowning is different from cardiac arrest in that lack of oxygen results from water submersion, so the first response should be to initiate breathing, Gill says. “But if a person is walking down the road and sees [a] neighbor cutting the grass who suddenly is grasping his chest, something else in the body is causing that to happen, and it’s not submersion underwater.”
 In a choking emergency, if you see a stranger who seems to be choking on a piece of food, again, don’t hesitate. Ask the person whether he or she is choking. If the person can speak, the airway is not totally blocked, and the person can cough out the object. Otherwise, perform the Heimlich maneuver, applying strong thrusts from behind to the abdomen, between the navel and the rib cage, which should dislodge it from the windpipe.
 “Ask ‘are you choking?’ Somehow despite all the languages, it’s universal to clutch our throat when we are as a signal,” Goodloe says. “If they can speak, their airway is not fully occluded, so encourage them to keep coughing to expel the food. Today, we might stand in front of them, but stand to the side a few feet away, and you’ll avoid the mainstream spray of droplets and anything else being coughed out. If they can’t speak, a good Heimlich thrust or two or more can absolutely save a life. Do it. And call 911 or direct someone else to do so.”
 He adds one more important piece of advice: “If you direct someone else to call 911, make firm eye contact and look to see they are dialing quickly. You’d be surprised the tragic results from just screaming, ‘Somebody call an ambulance. Call 911,’ and everyone assumes someone else is doing it.”
 Heart attacks up
 The numbers of non-hospital cardiac arrests are almost certainly higher now because experts say many people are delaying or avoiding care, afraid they will become infected with the novel coronavirus if they go to an emergency room. One recent study, for example, found that out-of-hospital cardiac arrests among New Yorkers rose from 1,336 patients in 2019 to nearly 4,000 this year during the height of the pandemic.
 “The most tragic deaths in this era of COVID-19 are the ones in patients reluctant to seek care or the reluctance of others to provide care because of their concerns about COVID-19,” Goodloe says.
 Most out-of-hospital attacks occur in the home or in long-term care facilities, with only 18.8 percent happening in public, according to the AHA. With the former, family members or staff in the facility often are available to help. With the latter — especially with the worrisome reluctance to seek care — people are even more vulnerable, and bystander help more crucial than ever.
 “We are concerned,” says Goodloe, who also serves on the board of the American College of Emergency Physicians. “We want to maintain — even grow — the levels of bystander CPR. We do not want COVID-19 to negatively impact the willingness of people to provide CPR. If it does, we will assuredly lose saveable lives.”
 As scientists continue to study the virus that causes COVID-19, emergency medicine specialists agree that there is more to learn. But current evidence suggests the transmission danger to rescuers of delivering CPR or responding to choking remains low, including for those whose protective gear may not go beyond that of a face mask.
 “I think there are unanswered questions, but we don’t get the opportunity to take a time out,” Goodloe says. “Each and every day, over 1,000 Americans are dying from sudden cardiac arrest, most outside the hospital. We have to provide the best care possible as we seek answers to questions that have arisen as a result of this pandemic.”

Despite the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has presented to small businesses across the nation, Lindale has experienced economic growth in recent months.
 Since the virus broke out and shut down many establishments, Lindale has seen small businesses band together to support one another, several new businesses open and is looking forward to two new hotels being built.
 The growth can be attributed to varying factors, Shelbie Glover, president and CEO of the Lindale Chamber of Commerce, said.
 “Lindale is absolutely growing despite the pandemic,” Glover said. “One of the largest reasons is we have an exceptional school district, people are moving here in order to attend our schools. Employment opportunities have grown and brought in numerous new residents due to the FedEx plant, and as new residents came in, local retail services grew.”
 Some of the latest businesses that have made their way to Lindale have established themselves at the Lindale Cannery, a venue that hosts restaurants, a new ice cream shop and a new coffee shop. It has also welcomed Wing Dingers, a restaurant that has experienced great success since its opening in June.
 Chris and Michelle Fischer are the owners of Wing Dingers.
 Chris Fischer said the amount of customers that have filtered through their establishment has wowed them.
 “It’s done really well,” he said. “What’s awesome is we opened a new location during this thing and it’s doing even better in this current situation than what we had expected. We had planned to open before the pandemic and due to difficulty in getting supplies, our opening was delayed by eight weeks. It’s been a great response and now we are excited for what’s to come.”
 Like many restaurants, Wing Dingers adapted to the needs of customers through the pandemic, which has helped their business thrive.
 Other small town businesses in the area have made efforts to promote one another by encouraging their clients to check out neighboring locally owned businesses, Glover said.
 “The small businesses have been flourishing despite the pandemic,” Glover said. “The small businesses have been standing together. For example, Lindale Candy has featured the Pink Pistol, encouraging their clients to shop at other locations.”
 The chamber has also taken initiatives to support the local businesses of Lindale.
 “We’ve been working really hard as a chamber to make sure that all businesses that are members had what they needed,” Glover said. “We took time to call the businesses and see what they needed and to ask them about their plans. We helped launch $15,000 worth of gift cards to boost the local economy, knowing that for every gift card bought someone will go back in the future to redeem it. We also gave businesses social media spotlights, each three times.”
 According to Glover, the local businesses did an excellent job of reinventing themselves during the pandemic, and she believes they will be stronger for it in the long run as a result of those adaptations.
 Above all, Glover stressed that the pandemic has not ended and those who wish to see the local economy thrive should make an effort to continue shopping local.
 “The main focus people need to remember is this pandemic isn’t over and we don’t know how long it will last,” Glover said. “It might be easier to hit the purchase button online but that doesn’t put money back into the local economy. Our consumers need to band together and shop local.”

The initiative forms part of the “Far Ban Bo” project, being funded by the European Union (EU) and implemented by a consortium of non-governmental organisations namely Friends of the National (FoN), CARE and Oxfam as a step to protect fishing livelihoods of fishers in Ghana.      The information gathered would be sent to the Fisheries Commission, Fisheries Enforcement Unit as well as partners of the “Far Ban Bo” Project database through the IUU monitoring mobile app.      Mr Philip Prah, Project Officer of FoN, a non-governmental organisation concerned with natural resource management and an implementing partner of the “Far Ban Bo” project, explained that the idea was to get enough evidence to prosecute illegal activities of fishermen, especially saiko fishers.      “With the provision of the smart phones, local fishermen can take videos and pictures of illegal fishing activities such as illegal trans-shipment, known as “saiko”, dumping of fish, light fishing and other prohibited fishing methods in the Section 88 of the Fisheries Act 625, during their fishing expedition and send them through the app for the prosecution of offenders,” he said.      He said as part of the project, IUU Community Monitoring Groups (CMG) had been established with the fishermen given relevant training on how to gather real evidence on illegal activities at sea in the beneficiary communities.      Fishermen across the country have largely accused “Saiko” fishing mostly done by foreign vessels managed by the Chinese and other foreign nationals for the illegal trans-shipment of fish thereby depleting fish stock.

Few high school coaches get to spend five years with a group of players, but that does not make saying goodbye any easier when the end finally comes.
 Phillip Rogers began coaching Marietta’s class of 2020 as their junior varsity coach when they were in eighth grade. Now, those players are set to graduate Friday inside Northcuttt Stadium.
 “This class is pretty special to me,” Rogers said. “It’s a really close-knit group. We’re really comfortable with each other. We’re pretty open and honest with each other. They understand my expectations and what I want from them. It’s like I tell them all the time; I care about them like they’re my own sons.”
 Rogers’ time with Ty Halliburton, Ben Edwards, Bowen Mayfield, William Underwood, Carlson Reed and Peter Warrick was cut short when the coronavirus pandemic forced schools to close in March, truncating the baseball season.
 “I hung onto hope for a long time that we would come back for the team’s sake, but, in the back of my mind, you realized what direction everything was going,” Rogers said. “You play every game like it’s your last. Unfortunately, for those guys, it became their reality.”
 Rogers, who also teaches U.S. history, was working on his computer at home when he received an email from the Georgia High School Association about the cancellation of spring sports. He called all six seniors in an attempt to break the news before they saw it elsewhere.
 “There were some tears shed, for sure, when we were talking on the phone,” Rogers said. “It wasn’t a shock to hear that it ended, but it was just a punch in the gut. Those guys won’t play high school baseball anymore.”
 However, the end of high school baseball does not mean the end of the student- athlete experience for the Marietta seniors,.
 Underwood will play baseball at Western Kentucky, while Reed will pitch at West Virginia. Warrick, the son of the former Florida State football star of the same name, will join the Florida Atlantic football team as a cornerback.
 Rogers discussed the players’ plans for the future when he live-streamed a senior night from the Marietta field for his players on the night that the original event was supposed to be held. The group will return to the field Tuesday so Rogers can honor his players one last time by giving them a certificate and their letters.
 Despite the unexpected end to the Blue Devils’ season, Rogers sees the cancellation as a learning opportunity for him and his players.
 “‘Fortunately, life goes our way sometimes. Unfortunately, sometimes, it doesn't,’” Rogers told one of his players. “‘You’re going to have to learn to roll with the punches, make the best out of it and learn from these experiences.’”

The mass exodus instantly clobbered our boat with deep wakes attacking from every direction. Already short on freeboard because of my terrible mistake of overloading my boat, we were on the verge of swamping in the middle of the lake in zero visibility.
 As I frantically sawed at the wheel in a desperate attempt to face into each wave and trough, all sense of direction was lost.
 When the water quieted at last I had no clue where to find the safety and shelter of Lakeview Acres. Six kids, all in whining need of bladder relief by now, were stranded afloat with their parents.
 I would have given my underwhelming kingdom at that moment for an illuminated lighthouse standing sentinel to guide me.
 A plea, “Which way to Lakeview Acres?” I shouted to some folks still relaxing on their lawn after the show bailed me out.
 I wonder how many other poor souls found themselves in similar tight spots during the decades since our close call.
 Families of the future, though, are why I am going to do what I can to help. Will you join me?

WEST BURLINGTON -- Southeastern Community College will resume in-person classes Aug. 19 when students return to its West Burlington and Keokuk campuses for the fall semester.
   
 As with most things in the pandemic world, however, college won't look quite the same as it did before as SCC has pulled out all the stops in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on its campuses while providing face-to-face instruction and support.
   
 "Our goal is that we're providing a safe college both in action as well as in perception," SCC President Michael Ash said Tuesday.
   
 The college closed its sites to the general public March 24 due to COVID-19 concerns, transitioned in-person credit classes to online courses, and canceled non-credit classes.
   
 While summer classes continued to be offered online, the bulk of faculty and staff were able to return to SCC June 1. Since then, staff from numerous departments began working with college administrators to plan for every aspect of the fall semester.
   
 They came up with four plans involving various levels of in-person instruction. The first was a full return. The second -- and current -- plan was to have students in class with appropriate safety measures in place. The third, which was put forward when Iowa Gov. Kim Reynold's proclamation allowing no more than 10 people to gather in one place was still in effect, called for a ratio of nine students to one instructor. The fourth, and least desirable, was for another semester of online instruction.
   
 While online programming still will to be offered, it isn't everyone's cup of tea, so SCC is working to make in-person instruction as safe as possible.
   
 Those wanting to enroll may do so up until the first week of classes.
   
 Required masks
   
 At the forefront of the precautions the college has adopted is masks, which will be mandatory for anyone on campus effective Aug. 10.
   
 "Students, faculty, staff, even community members, will be required to where a mask when they come on campus," Ash said.
   
 Students will be required to provide their own face covering, though disposable masks will be available on the first day of class should anyone forget theirs.
   
 Faculty and staff also wil be required to wear face coverings. SCC has provided fabric masks to everyone on its payroll. Face shields have been made available to faculty and staff who work directly with students.
   
 "The mask has a tendency to muffle the voice," Ash explained. "It also is difficult for some people to understand or hear if they can't read the lips."
   
 Ash acknowledged some people may take issue with having to wear a face covering.
   
 "It certainly runs deep in a lot of people as far as 'you can't tell me what to do, I have rights,'" Ash said." I would anticipate that we'll probably have faculty, staff, students, and perhaps some community members, who would object to wearing them, so we're working on a protocol of how to sit and chat with them about the importance of this and why this is necessary and asking for their compliance."
   
 Ash said the college has not yet decided what action to take next should those individuals continue to not comply.
   
 Cleaning
   
 While individuals are asked to do their part to protect themselves and others, SCC isn't cutting any corners.
   
 The college has amped up its cleaning efforts, having moved all but two of its custodial staff to morning and day shifts. Hand sanitizing stations have been installed throughout the campus and in every classroom.
   
 SCC also has three Hydrostat 360 Clorox machines, each one capable of sanitizing an entire room in mere minutes, that will be used frequently throughout the campuses.
   
 Social distancing
   
 While many classes will be able to accommodate social distancing with no more than 20 students, others typically have higher enrollment.
   
 Courses with more students may be split into two sections, with only half of students in front of an instructor on alternating days, though live stream of the class will be made available on off days. Student sections also may be paired with support staff on alternating days.
   
 Chairs and tables have been rearranged and removed from classrooms to allow for adequate social distancing.
   
 Signage also has been placed on floors in student service areas to mark where people should stand when waiting to be seen.
   
 Cafeteria
   
 Food also will be served differently. Self-service stations will not be available. Instead, students must request their desired food items from a food service worker, who will provide it to them in a disposable to-go box.
   
 Extra trash cans will be set up to accommodate for the anticipated increase in waste.
   
 The Little Theater has been set up to accommodate diners should there not be enough room for social distancing in the cafeteria.
   
 Residence halls and student athletes
   
 Residence hall students, the bulk of whom are student athletes, will begin moving in Aug. 10 with the help of sports teams.
   
 Upon arrival, they will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms and have their temperatures taken.
   
 After they get settled in, they will be tested for COVID-19. Those students then will be quarantined until their test results come back. During that quarantine time, they will not be able to go anywhere else on campus.
   
 "I know it's going to be tough for young people to kind of be stuck someplace, but better a few days of that than some serious stuff down the road," Ash said. "Hopefully we won't see any issues, but if we do, we want to be on top of it."
   
 If a student tests positive for COVID-19, they will be housed in an isolation room, where they will be supplied with food, water and other basic necessities. They also will have internet access and academic materials.
   
 Student athletes not living in the residence halls also must test negative for COVID-19 before they can participate in any campus activities or athletics.

ICARD — A man has been indicted after a crossbow shooting in May led to a teen’s death in June.                          Cameron Wayne Dellinger, 18, died June 14, according to an obituary published in the Hickory Daily Record.                          His death came just more than a month after he was shot in the head with a crossbow May 13 at 2138 Hunterwood Drive, a home that has a Hickory address but is in Burke County, according to previous News Herald articles.                          Siegfred Albert “Ziggy” Jackson, 28, of the Hunterwood Drive address, was identified as a suspect. Law enforcement officers spent several hours searching for him before finding him on the back porch of a home on Cape Hickory Road the afternoon of the shooting.

Hayden, executive director of Keene’s Doorway program, said insurance companies already don’t reimburse substance-use treatment at very high rates, so this sharp of a decline in billed revenue could lead to providers cutting services or shutting their doors altogether.
 The Doorway — a grant-funded service opened in January 2019 and run by Cheshire Medical Center — is part of the state’s “hub and spoke” system to screen, assess and refer people to substance-use treatment and support services in the community.
 And as a referral service, Hayden said, The Doorway has actually seen its numbers increase amid the pandemic, highlighting the need for drug treatment in the Monadnock Region.
 But, since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, he said, it has been drastically more difficult for The Doorway to find places to refer clients.
 “Our mission of facilitating access to treatment for those suffering from substance use disorder has been greatly hampered by the closures, reductions in census, and inability to meet face to face with clients,” he said in an email. “Our ability to place clients in an appropriate level of care is impacted by the reduced availability.”
 The New Futures report also found that more than 70 percent of organizations surveyed invested in new technology to keep clients safe during the pandemic, such as telehealth support, as well as glass barriers and cleaning supplies.
 These investments had an average cost of $6,324.
 Only nine of the 23 respondents said they spent money on personal protective equipment (PPE) by mid-May, likely due to many providers using telehealth services. The average amount those nine providers spent on PPE was about $3,000.
 But as more entities reopen for in-person services, the survey says, New Futures expects the number of providers purchasing PPE to rise.
 The loss of revenue and increased overhead costs due to COVID-19 left most respondents unable to hire staff from January to April.
 Six of the providers had to lay off staff following the emergency order, two had to furlough staff, and one had to cut staff hours.
 To survive through October, 12 of the 23 organizations surveyed said they will need to lay off or furlough additional staff.
 Hayden, of The Doorway, said if the financial strain documented in the report continues at this rate, it could cause the state’s progress against the opioid crisis to backslide.
 New Hampshire’s number of fatal overdoses skyrocketed starting in 2013 and 2014 as part of a nationwide epidemic and peaked in 2017 with a confirmed total of 490. Last year — with 415 reported by the state — marked the second year in a row that drug death numbers had dropped.
 “This decrease was in part due to enhanced efforts to coordinate and implement various levels of treatment,” Hayden said via email. “If these services experience a 10-15-percent decline, how many more individuals may die?”

Regional Joint Director of Collegiate Education R. Ravanan on Wednesday instructed a self-financing women’s college in Chennai not to ask teachers to come to the institution for admission work.
 The college had mandated teachers to come to the campus though the Directorate of College Education had issued a communication advising colleges to follow the admission guidelines it had issued.
 Last Saturday, several professors from the college represented to a teachers’ association that took up their case. A retired professor said, “I got distress calls from known staff at the institution compelling them to come for admission duty and meet parents for sale of applications, admission work and the like. The government has decided on online admissions for aided and self- financing colleges too. But it is not clear why some colleges insist on personal interaction.”

BOSTON -- It looks more and more as if the Bruins will have to wait for Stage 2 of Phase 3 of the NHL's Return to Play plan to truly start preparing for Phase 4: Playing meaningful hockey games.
 That's the best guess of team president Cam Neely, at least. Speaking Wednesday morning on a video conference with local reporters, Neely didn't seem all that optimistic that wingers David Pastrnak and Ondrej Kase would be allowed to join any full-team practices before Sunday's departure for the NHL's Eastern Conference hub in Toronto. The B's are scheduled to play an exhibition game against the Blue Jackets next Thursday, July 30, before starting round-robin play against the Flyers on Sunday, Aug. 2.
 "It's hard to say right now," Neely replied when asked if he thought Pastrnak and/or Kase could practice locally by the end of the week. "My best guess would be Toronto. There's hopes that before we leave (they'll skate with the team), but my best guess would be Toronto."
 Pastrnak, the Bruins' top scorer (95 points, fourth in the NHL) who tied for the NHL lead with 48 goals, and Kase, acquired in a Feb. 21 trade with the Ducks, had only been on the ice at Warrior Arena once through Wednesday. Believed to still be in the process of satisfying league and local testing and quarantine regulations for persons traveling from Europe (Pastrnak and Kase, both Czech Republic natives, returned home when the NHL paused its season due to COVID-19 concerns on March 12), each skated in a small group on Wednesday, July 15, but haven't been seen at Warrior since then.
 Per regulations negotiated as part of the Return to Play plan between the NHL and NHL Players Association, teams are only allowed to say that players absent from practice sessions are "unfit to participate."
 Neely couldn't say if recent photos which surfaced of Pastrnak and Kase in Boston's North End, and skating at a local rink, were factors in their being unable to participate in team practices. He did admit he wished both players had returned to the U.S. sooner than they did.
 "Of course," Neely said. "When we had the date for when camp started (Monday, July 13), and knew some players may need to quarantine when they get here, you kind of hope they would get here a little earlier. But we didn't really have much say in that. That was really left up to the players.
 "Obviously, with what's played out and transpired, you certainly would have hoped there were some (different) decisions made, but in the long run, I don't know if it's going to really affect us once we get into Toronto. I think we'll be fine."
 That thinking makes sense in the case of Pastrnak, who is expected to quickly re-establish chemistry with Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand, his linemates for the last two seasons.
 Kase, however, is a different story. Coming off an injury when the Bruins obtained him, he only got into six games as second-line center David Krejci's right wing, and managed just a single assist.
 "It takes time to get adjusted," Neely said. "We got (Kase) at the (trade) deadline, then we hit the pause not long after. He's still got to get adjusted to our team, our system, his teammates.
 "So it's been a little disappointing that we haven't been able to get him on the ice, because we did get him for that reason -- helping out with the secondary scoring."
 Otherwise pleased by what he'd seen over a week-plus of practices, Neely sympathized with head coach Bruce Cassidy and his staff's inability to prepare as much as planned. Cassidy has usually replaced Pastrnak with Anders Bjork, a third-year pro with only 14 goals and 108 games on his NHL resume, although rookie pro Jack Studnicka took shifts with Bergeron and Marchand on Tuesday. Kase has generally been replaced by Karson Kuhlman.
 "We'll see, once we get to Toronto, what happens with the lineup," Neely said. "Right now, as everybody's seen, it's been a little bit challenging for the coaching staff to put the groups and lines together the way they want.
 "Hopefully, when we get into Toronto, there's a good chance we'll be able to do that. If we're not, then some guys are going to have to step up, and I'm sure will relish the opportunities."

 There are countless instances where federal, state and local governments restrict or mandate activities for public health and safety, and we don’t think twice about complying with them.

A lifelong Bartlesville resident was remembered Saturday in the best way her family could imagine: through her quilts.
   
 The life of Phyllis Jane Walker, 81, was celebrated at the Rose Hill Community Baptist Church in Dewey with 70 of her quilts on display. She died July 11 in Creede, Colorado.
   
 According to daughter Donna Metcalf, Walker learned to sew at an early age and then took up quilting in the 1980s.
   
 "She always had a project or two going," Metcalf said.
   
 "It could have been several, machine-pieced quilt tops or a hand-quilted quilt on a frame, she was never idle. She was one of the best in her handwork."
   
 Metcalf said she and her siblings grew up watching their mother sew, crochet and knit before she began quilting.
   
 "She and a friend took some lessons at the local shops and continued to teach herself. Her work was beautiful," she said.
   
 Walker was not only creative but generous, as Metcalf said she gave away countless numbers of quilts to family and friends.
   
 "She loved making quilts for special occasions," Metcalf said, adding that family members received them for birthdays, graduations, weddings and the birth of a new baby.
   
 "Personally, I have five," she said.
   
 Metcalf estimates her mother created close to 200 quilts.
   
 "She was content to sew by herself but mostly enjoyed sewing with her daughters, close friends and several woman quilting groups," she said.
   
 "Every quilt had its unique story … fabric bought here, tried this new pattern, or made as a gift.
   
 "She was always excited to take you in her quilting room and show off the latest project, or might need fabric for your project. The quilt stash was always growing."
   
 Metcalf said she and her sister, Susan Powers, grew up learning her mother's skills. Metcalf quilts and her sister sews.
   
 Walker graduated from College High School and earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from Oklahoma Wesleyan College. She worked many years as a credit manager for Reda Pump until she retired. She married Kenneth Walker in 1998.

White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that the White House is seeking “targeted” money for testing, and that “we’re willing to put in money for targeted testing that makes sense, not just dumping money into a pot that contains $10 billion.”
 Some experts said lawmakers should approve more money and have the administration send it out quicker.
 “States have been using some of this money, but the problem is that it’s not enough and easy for the states to draw down,” said Sam Hammond, a policy expert at the Niskanen Center, a think tank that has been working with Senate Republicans on bolstering testing. “The scale of the problem will require a lot more money than they have so far.”
 These programs are just one part of what the administration and McConnell had envisioned as a $1 trillion package that is likely to be the last major coronavirus relief bill before the election.
 After attending the Senate Republican conference lunch, the White House envoys met with Pelosi and Schumer.
 “We will begin our conversations today. It is my hope that we can resolve our differences and have a bill by the end of next week,” Pelosi told fellow Democrats on a conference call Tuesday morning, according to a person on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss internal conversations.
 There has been little GOP enthusiasm for the payroll tax cut plan, even though Trump has said he might not sign a bill that does not include it. And GOP leaders are expecting a hard sell Tuesday but appear unwavering. A few Senate Republicans — including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Steve Daines of Montana — have endorsed the payroll tax cut as a sound policy.
 But senators and aides said Mnuchin did not talk about the payroll tax cut during the Senate GOP lunch. Instead he was confronted by complaints about the size of the emerging package, with some lawmakers who had voted for the $2 trillion Cares Act in March saying they could not support the new package if it exceeds $1 trillion.
 During the lunch, GOP senators voiced discontent over several components of the emerging aid package, whether it involved provisions pushed by the administration and the apparently ballooning size of the plan, according to officials directly familiar with the private gathering. All of the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the closed-door discussion.
 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, argued against the payroll tax cut, making the case that no voters would notice the tax relief and that he was skeptical that the policy changes could even be implemented before October.
 Although the payroll tax cut remains a top priority for Trump, his top lieutenants inside the meeting made little apparent effort to sell the policy to Republican senators, who largely remain opposed to the proposal.
 Electoral politics were also in consideration. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., urged other GOP senators to be attentive to what Republicans in competitive reelection bids are hearing on the ground from voters, and he made the case that if the GOP loses the majority, Democrats in control will implement policies that are much more costly to the national debt. So spending a bit more money now in a rescue bill that would aid Republicans in their races would be cheaper in the long run, he argued. Cotton is also up for reelection in November but is not considered to be in a competitive race.
 His viewpoint appeared to clash with that of Cruz, who vigorously warned against spending too much money on the package.
 Cruz said the GOP should be focused on a safe restart of the economy and warned that if the economy remains shuttered in November, Democrats will win both the White House and the Senate, and that Republican senators, who usually meet in the ornate Mansfield room in the Capitol, will “be meeting in a much smaller lunch room.”
 Mnuchin, who met with Republican senators before he was to huddle with the Democratic leaders, stressed to the GOP lawmakers that he will not launch into negotiations Tuesday afternoon with Democrats and that he would be in more of a listening mode with them.
 Earlier Tuesday, McConnell gave some details of the emerging GOP plan in remarks on the Senate floor.
 He said it would include $105 billion to help schools reopen, another round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, more stimulus checks to individual Americans, incentives for hiring and retaining workers, and reimbursement for businesses to establish safety measures.
 “The American job market needs another shot of adrenaline,” McConnell said. “Senate Republicans are laser-focused on getting American workers their jobs back.”
 Trump has enacted four laws that provided close to $3 trillion in new tax cuts and spending to try to help the economy and the health-care industry navigate the coronavirus pandemic. The economy remains weak, however, with an unemployment rate of 11.1 percent and about 20 million people collecting unemployment benefits. Lawmakers are split over what to do next. When he was heading into a meeting with Senate appropriators, Meadows was asked about the highest price tag they could agree to.
 “Obviously everybody looks at a trillion-dollar stimulus plan as the goal, but that’s going to be up to the senators and the House,” Meadows said. “It’s going to be a Senate- and House-led process.”
 Mnuchin said he would be there to see the talks through, having been through numerous rounds of frantic negotiations in the past.
 “We’re shooting to get something done by the end of next week,” Mnuchin told reporters as he entered his first meeting. “I’ll be here for the next two weeks until we get this done.”

A new survey shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has been costly for drug treatment providers in New Hampshire.
 The report, recently released by the nonprofit organization New Futures, surveyed 23 substance-use treatment providers statewide about how the pandemic has affected them in areas such as revenue and staffing.
 Substantial financial losses were found across the board due to fewer patients coming in during the public health crisis, as well as canceled fundraising or income-driven events, according to President and CEO Michele Merritt.

Nwangwu joined more than 100 experts who signed a letter, spearheaded by Greenpeace in June, saying the science shows reusable bags are safe as long as they’re cleaned between uses.
 The letter says it would be safer regardless to have customers handle and bag their own groceries during the pandemic.
 And Nwangwu says the best protection is one some stores are now requiring: workers and shoppers wearing face masks.
 “With the reusable bags not being primary source of infection but rather secondary, I wouldn’t spend my time worrying too much about that,” he says. “However, mask is primary. It’s important.”
 Like many states, New Hampshire has had a complete ban on reusable bags since the start of the pandemic but only a recommendation, not a requirement, for people to wear masks.
 Judith Enck is a former regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, and the founder of the Vermont-based group Beyond Plastics. She sees politics in that.
 “The plastics lobbyists did not miss a beat in exploiting the coronavirus to their financial benefit,” Enck says.
 At the start of the pandemic, the plastic sector was already fighting a rising number of local and state bans on single-use plastic bags. On March 18, the industry trade group asked federal regulators to speak out against these bans in light of new fears about coronavirus.
 On March 21, Governor Chris Sununu banned the use of reusable bags for as long as New Hampshire remains in a state of emergency.
 He’s pushed back on calls to lift that ban even as other states have done so, saying it’s important to move slowly as we “flex” open the economy.
 “I think there’s a value in being cautious about what we do,” Sununu said at a press conference in late June.
 Environmental advocates say they see the value in caution around coronavirus, but they don’t want to lose the awareness that’s grown recently around plastic as a climate-change issue.
 Plastic comes from crude oil, so demand for it drives more extraction — in particular, gas fracking, which generates a byproduct called ethane used in many plastics. More new facilities that process this chemical are being sited near low-income neighborhoods and communities of color.

WAREHAM - A resident told Selectmen Tuesday night the town went too far when it recently removed the hoops and backboards from town-owned outdoor basketball courts because popular pickup games were violating COVID-19 regulations.
 Pat Lester said he understood that crowds had to be discouraged but by making it impossible to play on the courts the town had penalized other folks who might want to use them while maintaining social distancing.
 He said perhaps signage could be added to advise people using the court to maintain social distancing if some of the rims and backboards were returned.
 "I would urge a more thoughtful and comprehensive approach," he said.
 Assistant Town Administrator Dorene Allen-England said town officials had been receiving complaints of "hundreds of people" playing at the Hammond basketball courts and that the events were featuring DJs, and food trucks, and full-on tournament play.
 There were no masks in sight, she said. It was a clear violation.
 There was no maintaining social distancing under the circumstances, she said, adding that town officials met with event organizers Aaron Strothers and Jordan Rezendes, and they agreed that it couldn't be done.
 Selectmen Chairman Peter Teitelbaum said, "basketball is a group activity," and that the town didn't have the resources to patrol all the courts to see that social distancing was being maintained at all times.
 He said the move was made "out of an abundance of caution, not to punish anyone."
 It's ultimately the Board of Health's purview and the town courts are the town administration's purview. "I support what they've done," Teitelbaum said.
 Allen-England said the events were otherwise well orchestrated and growing ever more popular. She said she was 100 percent on board with supporting them once relaxed COVID-19 guidelines made that possible.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — Boise State and San Diego State have been picked to win their divisions in the Mountain West preseason poll.
 The Broncos are the defending Mountain West champions. They received 20 of 21 first-place votes in the Mountain Division, with Wyoming garnering the other vote.
 The Aztecs had 19 first-place votes on the West side. Nevada earned the other two votes.
 The divisional winners are scheduled to meet in the conference’s title game on Dec. 5 at the home of the champion with the highest winning percentage in conference games.
 It marks the eighth season for the league’s divisional format. The Mountain Division predicted order of finish went Boise State, Wyoming, Air Force, Utah State, Colorado State and New Mexico.
 The West side was San Diego State, Nevada, Hawaii, Fresno State, San Jose State and UNLV.
 On Monday, the Mountain West announced a postponement of its football virtual media days, which were scheduled for July 27-29. Several Mountain West teams had scheduled strong Power-5 opponents to kick off the nonconference portion of their schedules only to see those games get canceled.
 Earlier this month, league Commissioner Craig Thompson said in regard to the conference’s fall sports campaign: “We are fully engaged with our membership and advisors on a nearly daily basis exploring the myriad of potential scenarios around returning to competition.”

A group of STR owners called the Community Host Network hired a lawyer who sent a letter to the council that argued the proposed ordinance was both unconstitutional and violated vested property rights of future property buyers who may not be guaranteed an automatic license.          Keenan Delaney, who owns a short-term rental at 119 Traverse St., argued during Monday’s public hearing that the proposed rule is not legally defensible. Furthermore, the village does not have data to prove such existing businesses are problematic to the community, he said.          “Doing it for the sake of doing it doesn’t make sense,” Delaney said.          Those arguments didn’t hold water with all village leaders, though.          “Just because they say it’s unconstitutional doesn’t mean it’s true,” said Barb Mullaly, council president pro-tem.          She said she considers the village attorney’s legal opinion more trustworthy than the opponents’ lawyer’s.          Mullaly said there’s nothing outlandish in the village’s proposed ordinance because “we haven’t created a new wheel.”          Village officials have for more than a year pursued the issue to balance the economic benefit of the stock of local rentals against negative impacts on housing availability for year-round residents.

Aam Aadmi Party councillors blocked a discussion on desilting of drains in Delhi and consequent waterlogging at a House meeting of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Wednesday, the BJP and Congress have alleged.                  Discussions were to be held over waterlogging and the COVID-19 situation, but none could take place as a result of a ruckus created by members of AAP, said Mayor Jai Prakash. He added that the responsibility to stop waterlogging laid with the Irrigation and Flood Control Department, the Public Works Department, the DSIIDC, and the civic body. However, lack of desilting at most major drains falling under the Delhi government’s jurisdiction is why waterlogging is taking place, he said.                  Congress leader Mukesh Goel said that his request to allow discussion over desilting of drains and COVID-19 situation was accepted, but AAP “did not allow the subject to be raised” leading to a temporary suspension of the meeting, despite which discussions were blocked.

“Governor Walz’s five-point battle plan helped enhance testing in long-term care settings and we are thankful for the support we received from the State of Minnesota,” said Annette Greely, president and CEO of Jones-Harrison Residence in Minneapolis. “Testing our residents and staff in partnership with the National Guard was a game changer in our ability to contain the spread of COVID-19 and take the necessary measures to ensure the safety, health, and wellness of our residents and staff. We appreciate the collaborative partnership with the Minnesota Department of Health and know through this plan we are better prepared in our ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19.”
 “We are forever grateful for how our employees, community, and the State of Minnesota rallied around our location when we experienced an outbreak,” said Michelle Solwold, campus administrator at Good Samaritan Society-Bethany in Brainerd. “It was always about collaboration and the well-being of residents. That’s how we got through the hard days, and that’s what long-term care facilities across the state will continue to need as we move through the pandemic. The team’s support means so much.”
 Walz and the Minnesota Department of Health announced a five-point battle plan to limit the spread of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities on May 7. In the months leading up to that announcement, state officials had been working with long-term care providers to help them implement and maintain strict infection control measures to help reduce the risk of introduction and spread of COVID-19 in facilities.
 On July 10, MDH released guidance providing expanded access to people designated as essential caregivers. On June 17, MDH began allowing window visits and outdoor visits with some limitations. The continued updated guidance helps facilities balance COVID-19 prevention with the general well- being of residents to limit the harms of social isolation.

Rask, who was seen wearing a splint on the ring and middle fingers of his glove hand on Friday’s Zoom call for Vezina Trophy finalists, revealed he had broken one of his fingers a couple of weeks ago while doing a box-jumping workout. During a practice last week, he left mid-session and did not return. He also missed Saturday’s practice for an undisclosed reason, though that was possibly because of something to do with coronavirus testing protocols.
 The netminder has been putting in his regular work the last two days at practice. In fact, all four goalies did some extra work before Tuesday’s practice. He said he doesn’t expect it to be a problem, though he didn’t downplay it as much as Cassidy, who joked it was due to “maybe too much drums.”
 “It’s getting better and I’m not worried about it. It’ll be all set once we start playing,” said Rask. “I slammed my finger at the edge of the box and the ligament fractured my finger. It’s a small fracture, nothing major. But like you can imagine, not great to catch a puck with that ... it’s one of those things that’ll linger a little bit. It’s been two or three weeks now and it already feels a lot better, so I’m optimistic that, within a week, I’ll have my normal glove on.”
 As for backup Jaroslav Halak, he had some issues with his glove hand in Tuesday’s practice. He took a shot that seemed to bother it, then took another that brought him to his knees in pain before he skated to the bench and shatter his stick in anger. He eventually made his way back onto the ice and finished practice. Fortunately for Halak, there were no fractured appendages.
 “I’m fine,” said Halak later on Zoom. “We had a goalie session before (practice) and the gloves were a little bit wet and I just got one of those stingers off the palm. Didn’t catch it quite in the pocket, so I just have to work on it.”

The number of COVID-19 patients at Lancaster County’s largest hospital continues to decline, falling to a dozen Wednesday morning, the fewest since the early days of the pandemic over four months ago.                          Only three of the 12 patients were receiving critical care, and only one was on a respirator at Penn Medicine Lancaster General Hospital, according to data updated daily on the hospital’s website. The hospital peaked at 56 patients in late April.                          Meanwhile, WellSpan Ephrata Community Hospital on Wednesday reported 10 positive and seven suspected cases with test results pending, for a total of 17. That compared to a total of 10 on July 16.                          County Commissioner Josh Parsons in a Tweet called the Lancaster General Hospital data “continued great news and more support for our position – deal with virus AND economy.”

People are testing positive for COVID-19 in clinical settings at twice the rate as those tested at walk-up mobile testing sites, the leader of the Northeast Texas Public Health District told Smith County commissioners Tuesday.
 Northeast Texas Public Health District CEO George Roberts said of those tested for COVID-19 at walk-up mobile testing sites there is about a 10-15% positive rate, while in clinical settings the positive rate is 30%.
 Roberts and Smith County Health Authority Dr. Jeffrey Levin provided an in- depth coronavirus briefing, laying out the latest statistics on the virus and explaining what the numbers mean.
 Roberts said the first three cases of coronavirus in Smith County were reported on March 13.
 Roberts said about 13,000 tests have been given in the Smith County and as of Tuesday morning, 1,907 county residents have tested positive for the virus, which shows roughly a 15% positive rate. In the afternoon, 53 new cases were announced for a current total of 1,960, which includes 511 recoveries, 11 deaths and 1,438 active cases, according to NET Health.
 He noted most people going to the walk-up sites are asymptomatic, while those visiting a hospital, emergency room or other medical facility are experiencing COVID-19 related symptoms.
 Roberts noted that NET Health statistics only reflect the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which is the most accurate testing available. Rapid test results from antigen tests are not included, as their results have been found to be less reliable than PCR tests.
 Roberts also addressed the social media rumors saying that someone, usually a friend of a friend, went to a walk-up testing site, registered to be tested, got tired of waiting and left, and were then called and told they tested positive. He said officials from the joint emergency operations center, which includes Smith County, the city of Tyler and NET Health, said these claims have been unfounded.
 People who have actually had this experience should contact the EOC to connect them on how to receive proper testing and clear up any misinformation.
 Smith County Judge Nathaniel Moran said the most relevant statistic to the public is the hospital capacity, as “flattening the curve” and ensuring the hospitals are able to keep up with the number of cases resulting in hospitalization has been a primary concern since the start of the pandemic.
 According to NET Health, as of Tuesday afternoon, 144 patients from East Texas are receiving treatment for the coronavirus at Tyler hospitals, which is up by seven since Monday.
 “Let’s watch the number of patients in Tyler hospitals,” said Moran. “It’s a critical number. Right now it’s still manageable.That’s the number that really is going to drive a lot of concern for how we treat people in the long term, that’s an important trend to watch.”
 Roberts said the age group of 11-60 seem to be the primary group that has been exposed to infection, while those 65 and older or individuals who suffer other serious medical ailments are those who become the most ill.
 The age range of 21-30 continues to be the range of the highest rate of infection, while those who are 60 and older have experienced the least amount of cases.
 Moran said that statistic is due to choices each age range has made, and suggested that the public “act more like 60-year-olds and less like 21-year- olds” when making decisions about being in social settings and large groups of people.
 “Treat everyone as though you have COVID-19, because it’s one of those things that may inform your behavior to respect and love your neighbor,” Moran said. “A large degree of people are asymptomatic and haven’t been tested. Be really concerned about vulnerable population.”
 In regards to asymptomatic individuals that have been infected with the virus, Levin said while symptoms may have never been manifested, a level of cellular damage may still take place. He said it’s unknown if that cellular damage leaves behind a lasting effect.
 “By the time we show symptoms, often there is an effect in our body,” said Levin. “A cellular level of damage is going on. Most viruses’ damage is short lived and the body repairs itself. With this virus, there are some underlying problems being left behind. Whether that occurs with asymptomatic people, we don’t know by this point. For now the focus is on prevention and treatment.”
 Roberts said as time has gone on, symptoms of the virus have become more clear, as have effective measures of prevention.
 The list of symptoms includes fever, chills, fatigue, headache, loss of taste or smell, loss of appetite, nasal congestion, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea, he said.
 “I get especially concerned when I hear a patient has lost their sense of taste or smell,” Roberts said.
 In addition to the methods of prevention that have been recommended since the beginning of the pandemic, including hand washing, social distancing, mask wearing and disinfecting surfaces, Roberts stressed the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle through monitoring diet and partaking in physical activity.
 “Eating and exercising patterns are important,” Roberts said. “Watch what you eat, and that will help if you do get COVID-19. We will all get it, it’s a matter of what happens when you do get it. A good diet, good walking habits, and weight training will help you get healthier. If and when we get COVID-19 we will be better when we get it. The virus is still with us, take the proper measures.”

HOUSTON (AP) — The Trump administration is detaining immigrant children as young as 1 in hotels, sometimes for weeks, before deporting them to their home countries under policies that have effectively shut down the nation’s asylum system during the coronavirus pandemic, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press.A private contractor for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is taking children to three Hampton Inn &amp; Suites hotels in Arizona and at the Texas-Mexico border, where they are typically detained for several days, the records show. The hotels have been used nearly 200 times, while more than 10,000 beds for children sit empty at government shelters.Federal anti-trafficking laws and a two-decade-old court settlement that governs the treatment of migrant children require that most kids be sent to the shelters for eventual placement with family sponsors. But President Donald Trump's administration is now immediately expelling people seeking asylum in the U.S., relying on a public health declaration to set aside those rules.Lawyers and advocates say housing unaccompanied migrant children in hotels exposes them to the risk of trauma as they're detained in places not designed to hold them and cared for by contractors with unclear credentials. They are challenging the use of hotels as detention spaces under the Flores court settlement."They've created a shadow system in which there's no accountability for expelling very young children," said Leecia Welch, an attorney at the nonprofit National Center for Youth Law. "There really aren't enough words to describe what a disgraceful example of sacrificing children this is to advance heartless immigration policies."ICE largely declined to answer questions but referred to the contractors as "transportation specialists" who are "non-law enforcement staff members trained to work with minors and to ensure that all aspects of the transport or stay are compliant" with the court settlement. It wouldn't say whether they're licensed child care professionals or have received FBI background checks.In McAllen, Texas, people in scrubs went room to room on the fourth and fifth floors of the Hampton Inn caring for children, according to Roberto Lopez of the nonprofit Texas Civil Rights Project. He walked through the hotel Friday, spotting a small child holding on to a gate in a doorway as an adult on the other side played with him. Lopez said he could hear the cries of at least one child in the hallway.Parked outside were unmarked white vans with the silhouettes of adults and children visible through the windows, Lopez said. He didn't see logos or insignia for any government agencies on the vans or in the hotel.The records obtained by AP show the Hampton Inn in McAllen was used most often to detain children — 123 times over two months. The other hotels are in Phoenix and El Paso.Hilton, which owns the Hampton Inn brand, said in a statement Tuesday that all three hotels were franchises and it believed rooms were booked directly with those owners. Hilton wouldn't say how many rooms had been used to detain children or how much the rooms cost."We understand these properties have been used for their intended purpose — temporary accommodation for guests traveling between locations," the statement said.Castle Hospitality, which operates the McAllen hotel, said it didn't know its rooms would be used to detain children until they arrived."We are not making any political statements one way or the other by taking in this group and we feel that anyone, especially children in such difficult circumstances, is entitled to safe and clean accommodations and that's what we aim to provide," a company statement said. "In our conversations with the group contact, we have been assured that all state and federal regulations are being followed."At least 2,000 unaccompanied children have been expelled since March, when the Trump administration announced it would broadly refuse entry to people seeking protection in the U.S. The administration has cited the threat of the coronavirus in saying it doesn't have the resources to allow migrants to stay.The U.S. has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in the world, and the virus is ravaging much of the West and South, including Texas' Rio Grande Valley, where McAllen is located.Before March, Central American children who crossed into the U.S. alone were generally sent to facilities overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS facilities have bedrooms and schooling, and children are given access to lawyers and generally placed with family sponsors. The facilities also are licensed by the states where they're located. Federal anti-trafficking law requires the government to promptly refer most children to HHS.While U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it made 1,564 apprehensions of unaccompanied children at the southern border in June, HHS says it received just 61. CBP wouldn't say how many children are expelled right away, how many are sent to hotels or how border agents decide between those options or referral to HHS. The agency referred questions about hotels to ICE.ICE said it uses contractor MVM Inc. "to transport single minors to hotels and to ensure each minor remains safe and secure while in this temporary housing." MVM had a contract with ICE for "transportation services" extended for $49 million on March 31, according to federal contracting data. The company declined to answer questions.According to MVM's hiring website, it's looking for "bilingual travel youth care workers" based in Phoenix and McAllen to provide "humble care and service to unaccompanied children and teens." The posting doesn't require a child care background but says selected applicants will be given a "government background investigation."The border agencies and MVM have been criticized for their treatment of immigrant children during the Trump administration, including wide-scale family separations in 2018 and the detention of children in squalid border stations in Texas last year.The government provided records on the detention of children and teenagers expelled in April and June to a team of lawyers representing the interests of immigrant children under the Flores agreement, reached in 1997. Records for May weren't available.The Hampton Inns in McAllen, El Paso and Phoenix were used 186 times. No other hotels appear in the records, which indicate that 169 children were detained at the hotels, some with multiple stays.At least two 1-year-olds were held for three days. But some young children, including 3- to 5-year-olds, were detained for two weeks or longer. One 5-year-old was detained for 19 days in the McAllen hotel.The records indicate the children were not accompanied by a parent but don't say more about the circumstances of their crossing the border. In the past, some very young children have been brought by older siblings or other relatives. Others have been sent by parents waiting for their court dates in refugee camps on the U.S.-Mexico border with hopes they will be placed with relatives.Karla Vargas, a Texas Civil Rights Project lawyer, represented a 13-year-old girl who was detained in a hotel and later expelled to El Salvador. Vargas said border agents didn't tell the girl's mother in the U.S. that they had detained her daughter. A person who crossed the border with the girl called her mother.“The children with whom we’ve spoken say there are other children in the hotels,” Vargas said. “We know that there are masses of children.”Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

WEYMOUTH -- On May 22, the modern American eatery True North Kitchen and Bar reopened its doors after being closed since March 15 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Unlike some other restaurants, True North stayed closed, even for takeout, so that the owners could quarantine together and spend time with their 18-month- old granddaughter.
 "It was so unknown what was going on. There was panic in people's eyes and I didn't want to put my people at risk," said owner Joe Campbell, who runs the restaurant with his wife Janet.
 Their two children also work at the restaurant, one of whom is pregnant and the other, Ben, who is the chef.
 During those two months, Campbell said he took the time to reflect on how the industry will inevitably change, and how True North can adapt to this "new normal."

 "I spent that time coming up with different ways to improve the business. Technology-wise with a new website that offered online ordering and payment. I must've watched dozens of different webinars on other things that could help the business such as best loan programs and PPE loans," he said.
 Meanwhile, his son did a lot of recipe testing and was cooking "all day, every day" in their home kitchen. One week it was doughnuts, another it was bagels.
 "People asked me how long I was in quarantine for. I was in quarantine for 10 pounds," said Campbell, joking. "That's how much I gained."
 Upon reopening for takeout in May, Campbell says a lot has changed, not only in how they operate, but also for how he views future restaurant endeavors.
 Right now, he is the only one in his family coming in to work. When he gets home, he quarantines in a separate part of the house and enjoys a glass of wine with his wife on the porch.
 Typically takeout was 10 percent of their business, but now it is 50 percent, even with indoor and outdoor dining allowed. As a result, Campbell started looking into improving presentation in the portable containers, as well as more eco-friendly packaging.
 For outdoor dining, they've created a space in the back parking lot under a tent with new furniture, rugs, lighting and plants.
 "It's a little oasis on Route 3A, where cars go whizzing by but you don't even know they're there from the back of the building," he said.
 The veteran restaurateur has also begun reconsidering future ventures. What once was going to be another restaurant might instead be a limited service eatery, in which people grab the food and go.
 Campbell says counter service businesses have done well during the pandemic as they have social distancing built into their model.
 "People are reluctant to expose themselves, especially now as we see other parts of the country blowing up," he said.
 Since reopening, True North has stopped offering lunch service and brunch on weekends, doing roughly 60 percent of business they used to, said Campbell. He understands why people are still hesitant to dine out and appreciates those who are coming out in support -- be it for takeout or dining out.
 "When we reopened, it was like seeing a long lost friend walk through the door. They were excited about us, but also about their chicken parmesan or carrot cake," he said, laughing.
 Campbell says True North might be best known for their Mongolian chicken tenders, served with coconut creme fraiche, grilled pineapple and a sweet and spicy sauce.
 "Even though we're a small neighborhood restaurant, everything is done with a lot of care, everything from scratch," he said. "I think that's what we're known for. The care that goes into every dish."
 He is happy to be up and running again and ready to adapt for what comes next, something he's always had to do in his nearly five decades in the industry.
 "I don't think things will really go back to what used to be normal. People's habits have changed, society has changed. There are things we all have to adapt to to survive. It's kind of always been that way, but even more so now."
