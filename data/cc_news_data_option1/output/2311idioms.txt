Edward Nelson Madison died Saturday, June 6, 2020 in his home in Boulder, Colorado. Born in Devonshire Parish, Bermuda on October 10, 1927, Edward grew up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens. He entered the US Merchant Marine Academy in 1945 as a midshipman, studying marine engineering for two years and serving a year at sea. Edward graduated from Cornell University in 1952, where he studied mechanical engineering for three years and industrial and labor relations for two years. He served as a finance officer in the US Army from 1952 to 1955, where he met his wife, Nancy. Nancy and Ed settled in Port Washington, New York and for the next 40 years Ed was president of Prest-O-Sales &amp; Service, an industrial distribution business in Long Island City, NY. During his tenure, Ed served as president of his industry trade association and gave his time to numerous advisory boards, including the first hospice pilot program in New York. He also received his MBA in finance from Long Island University. Edward's strong sense of volunteerism prompted him to become involved in local government where he served as two term Mayor of the Village of Sands Point. Ed, Nancy and their children were active members of Manhasset Bay Yacht Club and spent many hours sailing on Long Island Sound, as well as enjoying tennis in local leagues and golf at Sands Point Golf Club. Edward retired in 1993 and he and Nancy relocated to Boulder, Colorado. They spent the next 20 years traveling extensively with friends. He was a volunteer at Boulder Community Health for many years. Ed took genuine interest in every person he met and found the greatest satisfaction in listening to people. He was a great orator himself and always conveyed a message of diplomacy and fairness and let each person know how important they were to him. Ed loved many wonderful family dogs and had a special way with all animals. Ed spent his last months under the compassionate care of Trail Winds Hospice in Boulder. He is preceded in death by his parents, Edward Madison of Skien, Norway; his mother, Charlotte Wilson Madison of Devonshire, Bermuda; and his sister, Charlotte Devers Wallace. He is survived by his wife, Nancy and his children Douglas, James, Sherry and Susan, as well as four grandchildren.

BENTON, Ill. (AP) — In 1995, the year after Gage Peach was born, his hometown of Benton was the site of a KKK rally on the square in front of the historical Franklin County Courthouse. Peach said it’s shocking that happened in his lifetime. On June 6, Peach, now of West Frankfort, along with Kiersten Owens, of Benton, both of whom are white, organized a demonstration that drew about 60 people to that same location to call for justice and equality for black Americans. For nearly three hours, they held signs, chanted and paid respect to George Floyd, whose death in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day has sparked demonstrations across the nation in cities big and small. With the courthouse slated to be demolished and replaced, Peach said he felt that it was important “that we leave it with a good mark on history, that we’re all for equality. We don’t want Franklin County to be known for its racism. This is more about bringing the community together more than anything else.” Joining people across the nation, hundreds have gathered across Southern Illinois in recent days to protest the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Not unexpectedly, the largest regional demonstrations have taken place in Carbondale, which is relatively diverse — about 40% of its population is people of color. Carbondale is no stranger to hosting large marches and protests, dating back to the civil rights and Vietnam War era. And it has hosted several Black Lives Matters marches and rallies over the past few years. What seems to distinguish this moment’s push for racial justice in Southern Illinois is the number of gatherings that are taking place beyond the borders of the liberal-leaning university town. Familiar rally chants of “I can’t breathe,”...

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) — The entire “Game of Thrones” series on DVD. Iconic Soundgarden albums. And oh yeah, literary classics like “Pride and Prejudice.” The Huntsville Madison County Public Library system is comprised of nearly 500,000 physical items. And that number doesn’t include digital resources, such as e-books. Huntsville libraries will reopen June 15, with coronavirus safety measures in place. The system’s 12 branches were last open to the public on March 15. While libraries may not be as hip as a streaming app, they play a huge role in making a community livable, says HMCPL director of public relations Melanie Thornton. “When families move here, one of the first places they seek is the library,” Thornton says. After Huntsville’s libraries powered down mid-March, the system reconfigured. Initially most of the 135-person staff, including full- and part-time employees, worked from home. (Around 200 volunteers also help make the library system go.) From home, staff focused on tasks like renewing and issuing library cards via email, managing the collection, writing blog posts and recommendations, recording material for the library’s “storytime” program, etc. Some staff entered branches to conduct inventory and empty book drops. HMCPL began offering curbside pickup for their items holds May 6. “The first three days of curbside, we checked out around 16,000 items,” Thornton says. “The service has been so well received that we are keeping it for the time being.” Once items are available, curbside pickup at the library works quite similar to how it does form local restaurants. Except instead of burritos or burgers you’re picking up Dostoevsky or “Daredevil.” Upon arrival, cardholders call a number displayed outside the library, to let staff know they’re here. Then, a...
