Sean Stewart and his father Rod are both facing a charge of Simple Battery stemming from a New Year's celebration. According to the arrest report filed in Palm Beach County, the confrontation happened at a hotel called the Breakers around 11 p.m. on December 31, 2019.
 The security guard involved, who is an employee of the Breakers, told the police that he was working a private event that night. The event was situated in a children's area of the hotel. The guard said that he observed a group of people near the check-in table, which later turned out to include Sean and Rod Stewart. They were not permitted inside the private event. The guard said the "group began to get loud and cause a scene" and refused to leave.
 The arrest report states that Sean Stewart got "about nose to nose" with the security guard. The guard says he put his hand on Stewart's chest and told him to back up. Stewart then shoved the man backward. The guard told police that Rod Stewart then stepped forward and punched him in the ribs with a closed fist.

The lack of shock-absorbing material means it won't be as protective against drops as other cases, but the additional grip offered by the gravel-like textures of this Gravel Green option should mean you're less likely to drop it anyway. It's sleek and thin, and comes in a variety of colors to fit your style -- but be aware it doesn't cover all of your phone's sides, so you're risking scratches in those areas.

Real Madrid made an impressive start to the year as they picked apart a robust Getafe side to win 3-0 in La Liga on Saturday. Raphael Varane was the instigator of two goals at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez, first pressuring Getafe David Soria into a missed punch and an own-goal before himself heading home a cross from Toni Kroos. Luka Modric then added a third deep into injury-time after a brilliant first-time pass by Gareth Bale had set Madrid away on the counter-attack.
 Victory sends Zinedine Zidane's side top of the table briefly at least, one point above Barcelona, who play later on Saturday against Catalan rivals Espanyol.
 Getafe remain seventh and very much in the race for Champions League qualification. Another excellent season under coach Jose Bordalas is proving last year's remarkable top-four challenge was far from a fluke.
 But their usually stubborn defence was overly-generous as Soria's mistake and then a free header put Madrid in charge before Modric complete what was, in the end, a comfortable win.
 Without either Sergio Ramos, who was suspended, or Eden Hazard, who continues to nurse an ankle injury, this looked an awkward fixture for Zidane's team on the back of a two-week winter break.
 Instead, they keep the pressure on Barcelona before travelling to Saudi Arabia next week, where they could be set for a Clasico final in the Spanish Super Cup, with Valencia up first on Wednesday in the last four.
 Hazard will stay at home after Zidane confirmed on Friday the Belgian will not return until later this month at the earliest.
 His worryingly extended absence has offered a reprieve for Isco, who started again, and Bale, who twice should have scored in the second half, only to tee up Modric via substitute Fede Valverde.
 At the other end, Thibaut Courtois appears finally to be finding his best form after a rocky start since his summer move from Chelsea. Courtois made three strong saves before Varane's second gave Madrid breathing space.
 Getafe's success under Bordalas has been built upon tenacity as well as discipline and hard work, with right-back Allan Nyom particularly eager to make his presence felt on Bale early on.
 Yet one late challenge too many earned Nyom a yellow card and Madrid a dangerous free-kick that led to the opener shortly after the half-hour mark.
 Kroos' cross was put back in by Ferland Mendy on the opposite side and while Soria sprung out to punch, he failed to connect and only succeeded in sending the ball bobbling into his own net.
 Karim Benzema tested Soria at his near post but Courtois was the busier of the two keepers. He palmed away a stinging volley from Mauro Arambarri, pushed out a drive from Faycal Fajr and then blocked a close-range header from Leandro Cabrera.
 Getafe's frustration was compounded eight minutes into the second half when an unmarked Varane nodded in Kroos' whipped cross and the home side never looked like being revived thereafter.
 Bale tried to chip Soria and then go round him but made amends for his misses in injury-time.
 Mendy twisted free before feeding Bale, who curled the ball beautifully, first time and on the turn, into the path of the sprinting Valverde. He could have scored himself but instead set up Modric, who finished into an open net.

 At the age of three months, Florida's texting-while-driving law has grown its teeth.
 The law, (HB 107) passed in the last session of the Legislature, went into effect in baby steps. From October to Jan. 1, texting was not allowed, but law enforcement officers were supposed to issue texting drivers written or verbal warnings.
 The law also banned the use of handheld cellphones entirely in designated school crossing areas, school zones or highway construction areas. But again, just warnings until the start of 2020.
 As of Wednesday, things got real. Drivers can get traffic citations, punishable as a moving violation, with three points going against their license for driving while texting. Or for having their phone up to their ears in school and work zones. (And if you drive around Bay County on any given day it's almost hard to avoid driving through a construction zone, particularly around the Hathaway Bridge and Front Beach Road and Hwy. 390, which always seem to be in some state of work). Tickets issued for a first offense carry a $30 fine plus court costs
 This doubles if you get a second violation within five years.
 Florida was late to the game doing this. Lawmakers passed a weak, unenforceable law in 2013. By 2019, when the Legislature passed the new law, 47 other states already had similar laws or stricter ones.
 And with good reason. According to the National Highway Transportation and Safety Association, texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. Anecdotally, wrecks that used to lead to the question, \"I wonder if they were drinking?\", now have people wondering if the driver was texting.
 A study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that about 3% of drivers are using their phones while driving at any given time, which is actually an improvement over past years. Still, that's a frightening thing to contemplate on a busy highway. People are not good at multi-tasking, especially at high speeds where a moment's inattention can have frightening results.
 Florida had 3,174 traffic crash deaths in 2018, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, It's difficult to know how many were caused by distracted driving, but the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles estimates at least 233 were caused by distracted driving, including three each in Santa Rosa and Bay counties, and one in Okaloosa County. The three counties combined for about 2,760 distracted driving wrecks in 2019 that left about 140 people with incapacitating injuries. (For county-by-county statistics, click here)
 Scary numbers. Which is why it's gratifying to see the Legislature finally take action after years of seeing similar bills die without a hearing.
 The Florida Highway Patrol says it has issued about 800 warnings during this interim period. As with seatbelt use, it will take some time for word to reach the average Florida driver that the law has changed. This will no doubt be an unwelcome surprise to many.
 But as the public becomes more aware of the law, we can only expect safer driving in the year ahead.

No matter where you live, there are bound to be weather challenges this winter. Your home may suffer damage, minor or major, from the onslaught of colder weather, along with wind, heavy rain, ice storms or even major snow systems. This can affect not only the integrity and value of your home, but may lead to costly repairs down the road. That’s why it’s smart to prep now, to prevent bigger problems in the future. It’s also a good idea to make sure that your home is prepped for spending more time indoors.
 Here are basic tasks to prepare for wintry weather, and to ensure your family stays healthy and safe inside.
 Are your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in good working order? Make monthly testing of these safety features a regular part of your seasonal household chores. For battery-operated units keep up-to-date with battery changes as per manufacturer instructions. Also be aware and take action if you hear any low battery alarms. Also, do you have a home fire extinguisher in your kitchen?
 Make sure your home’s heating and air conditioning units are in good condition, and schedule regular tune-ups to avoid unpleasant surprises. Change your furnace filter frequently, so your air quality stays clean indoors, where you’re likely to spend more time as temps get cooler. Also, consider setting up a schedule with a professional to have your ductwork cleaned on a regular basis.
 Check weatherstripping around exterior doors, replacing where necessary, then seal and caulk exterior wood, since wood trim can rot around windows and outside doors. Walk around the outside of your home with spray foam gap sealer and caulk to plug gaps, cracks and holes in siding and around windows. Find and seal air leaks where you may be losing valuable heat and letting in the cold. Many energy companies offer an energy audit to discover where you may be losing both heat and money — and advise you on ways to improve your insulation. Making sure your gutters are cleaned out and in good condition helps protect your home’s exterior from exposure to moisture due to rain, ice or snow melt.
 Power outages occur for many reasons, usually outside your control. In major storms, outages can last for days or even weeks when a large area is affected. To protect your home and family, an automatic standby generator gives you peace of mind — even when you’re not at home.
 Look for a unit that comes in a durable aluminum enclosure with options that can withstand up to 181 mph winds and can be installed as close as 18 inches from your home (important for areas with tight lot lines and strict building codes), such as select models of KOHLER standby home generators. They will automatically start and restore your power in seconds, whether you’re home or away.
 Units can be monitored remotely from your smartphone or laptop. The unit is permanently installed near your home, and provides high-quality power that can run your sump pump, furnace or air conditioner, and major appliances — plus delicate electronics. KOHLER generators feature commercial-grade engines built to withstand extreme workloads over many years, and they come with a five-year warranty. This is not a do-it-yourself job; you will need to work with a professionally licensed and insured generator installer.
 Now is a great time to get your trees trimmed, while it’s easier to access branches without all the extra foliage. Trimming dead branches helps prevent problems that can occur due to wind or ice storms, when a falling branch could endanger a power line, car or home. Like all professional contractors, work with tree service companies that have proper credentials and insurance.
 Whether you inspect your roof yourself or hire a professional, it’s a good idea to take care of repairs before winter wind, hail, snow and ice do their worst. Look for blistering, curling, buckling — or missing — shingles. Moss or lichen growing can indicate decay underneath. Any visible sagging of your roof, rust or cracks around flashing or vent pipes should also be repaired promptly to avoid later problems like leaks.
 Don’t let the calamities of winter take you and your family by surprise. Doing prep work and maintenance on your home now, with a focus on safety, will ensure that you’re ready for anything that may come your way — even if it’s just hunkering down in your home for the season.

Act now to protect resources
   
 It's been five years since 75% of Florida voters approved the Water and Land Conservation Amendment.
   
 According to the Trust for Public Land, between the years 1998-2019: 93 of the 113 (82%) state or local land conservation ballot measures that have been placed on the ballot have been approved by the voters.
   
 Yet, our legislators have failed to use the funding as intended. Funding that comes from 33% of documentary stamp taxes, applied to real estate transfers, to go toward the land acquisition trust fund. It is estimated that the documentary stamp tax for 2019-2020 to be $2.78 billion; 33% of that is over $900 million.
   
 In the 2019-2020 budget $319 million was spent on Everglades protection, a reservoir project, springs protection and Lake Apopka. An additional $34.5 million was spent on traditional Florida Forever projects. This leaves approximately $500 million that should have been allocated to the land acquisition trust fund unaccounted for.
   
 We are calling on our legislators to use the funding as it was intended - for the conservation and restoration of our waterways and natural resources. We must act now to protect Florida's unique and diverse natural resources.

It's a difficult one this year..the FA cup should still be a top priority, best moment of me watching the reds was winning the FA cup at the old Wembley vs Everton in '86.   With us in the driving seat for the league this year changes everything..including my attitude towards the FA cup priority.   We want the league..simple.   We don't want injuries to key players which may undermine that & that's why I understand why JK will field an understrength side.      My guess would be something like..

Trump immediately wanted to target Soleimani. It was a decision his predecessors had avoided and one that risked inflaming tensions with Tehran. Some advisers voiced concern about the legal justification for a strike without evidence of an imminent attack in the works against Americans. So other options were discussed in the coming days with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and national security adviser Robert O'Brien, including bombing the base of the group blamed for killing the U.S. contractor.

WASHINGTON - Since the day Donald Trump opened his presidential campaign, he made it clear that military operations in the Middle East are not his cup of tea. "We spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice," he told Hillary Clinton in one of the presidential debates leading to the 2016 presidential elections.
 He made it clear on many occasions that his focus is going to be on adding jobs and strengthening the US economy. He spoke more than once about the military presence in the Middle East being an impediment to that goal. "Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years," he said in his 2019 State of the Union Address. "In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives ... As a candidate for president, I loudly pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars," he added.
 Trump cited the same approach when he addressed the nation regarding his decision to withdraw from Syria. "We're talking about sand and death," he said.
 So how did Trump, a leader that was so cautious with using military force, take such a bold step to kill Soleimani? Some experts are arguing that by taking that action, Trump avoided a broader confrontation between Iran and the US.
 "One way to stop sending Americans to Iraq to deal with existential threats like al-Qaeda and ISIS is to kill Qasem Soleimani," Mike Pregent, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute and former US intelligence officer in Iraq told The Jerusalem Post. "This is intelligence, strategically-driven decapitation of Qasem Soleimani's grip on Iraq. It's the only way Iraq has a chance. Iraqi protesters now have a chance to take their country back," he added.
 "Thursday night was likely the most consequential night in Trump's presidency, from a foreign policy perspective," Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) told the Post. "I don't think that's a loss on his base, and even the isolationists have to concede that eliminating Solemani was a major moment for the president."
 According to Schanzer, Trump's policy never approved Iran's activities, but in the past week, when the Iranians started to target US personnel directly, they left the US president no choice.
 "When Iran struck the Saudi oil fields, it was Saudi, not American," he said. "Even when Iran harassed ships on Hormuz, they were other countries - Naval vessels, not American. And as long as Iran steered clear of the United States in its provocations, Iran seemed to have not a green light, but maybe a yellow light."
 He continued, "At the moment that Qasem Soleimani and his militias began to target the United States directly, that was when the light switch turned on for US strike," he continued. "And it became clear that Trump was not trying to deliver a modest message. He delivered a forceful one, about as forceful as one could imagine short of striking Iran itself."
 Schanzer emphasized that the answer to the question of what comes next relies entirely upon Iran's decision-making."They have a few choices," he said. "One is they could directly challenge the United States. This would be disastrous for the regime. But it's a possibility given the anger and the emotion that has stemmed from the United States eliminating a man who Khamenei saw almost as a son."
 Ilan Goldenberg is Senior Fellow and Director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. "This seems to have been an entirely impulsive move," he told the Post. "It's not even clear he understands the consequences. According to some reporting, his advisers put the idea on a power point slide along with a number of other options, and he surprised them by choosing it."
 Asked if he believes that a full-scale war is possible, he said that it's an option. "Neither side wants all-out war, but that hasn't stopped them from getting all the way to the precipice," he said. "Iran will retaliate certainly in Iraq possibly with attacks elsewhere in the region. It may also seek to target senior US government officials. If it is successful, that could absolutely trigger a US response that brings us to a war nobody wants."

When Houston Texans' star JJ Watt proposed to girlfriend Kealia Ohai back in May, he was still looking ahead to having a record year during the 2019 NFL season. However, the 29-year-old MVP defensive player suffered a torn pectoral muscle on October 27, which required immediate surgery to repair. Many believed, including Watt, that his season was over.
 As Houston prepares to take on the Buffalo Bills for the AFC Wild Card game on Saturday, it was a huge surprise for many when head coach Bill O'Brien announced that Watt, 30, would be coming off the injured reserve to help his team in their playoff run.
 O'Brien said that fans can expect him to play "quite a bit" on January 4, which means fans can also expect to see Ohai cheering Watt on at NRG Stadium on game day. While a torn chest muscle would typically sideline an athlete four months, Watt's quick comeback is considered nothing short of "superhuman" as reported by the Houston Chronicle, and Ohai deserves at least some of the credit for keeping the defensive end's spirits up while he was sidelined.

 It's clear the Watt is absolutely in love with his fiancee, and having her around to support him during his recovery seemed to work wonders. When he posted pictures of himself working out, Ohai kept things light by commenting, "You are so cute."

In February 1966 I was asked by the editor of the Orrville Courier Crescent, to start writing a column "like the letters I used to send him when he was in college." He had been an intern at the paper the previous year before returning to Kent State University to finish his degree in journalism.  
 And that is how it all began. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that I would still be writing it almost 54 years later, outlasting numerous editors, and three weekly newspapers, along the way.  
 When I first started out the type was set by hand in the back of the Courier building. I loved the smell of the printer's ink. Now it is all electronic.  
 I don't know about you, but it has been very therapeutic for me. We have been through many good times - some bad times, and some sad times. You have gone along with me on my travels and adventures over the years.  
 I was born and raised in Holmes County, never out of Ohio until age 16 when the kids who finished their 4-H projects got to take a train ride to Pittsburgh. So, it was quite exciting to visit a lot of the United States and need a passport in my 30s to travel to places like Italy, Yugoslavia, Russia and Brazil.  
 I have appreciated the letters you sent, the face to face contact, and all those recipes you shared. I know you tried some of the dishes. One time I got a phone call from a reader who was making something and had a question about the ingredients. I was on an extension ladder painting the side of a building when the call came but I got down and looked up the recipe to answer her question.  
 You have suffered through child rearing with me from toddlers through college. When it all began Alan was almost 6, Valerie 4 and Robyn was a year and a half. You were there two years later when we learned Robyn had a brain tumor. It turned out to be benign, but she spent a month in the hospital in Cleveland. I stayed with her while Alan stayed with a neighbor and Valerie was farmed out to the grandparents.  
 You were there when the kids went off to college, got married and produced our soon-to-be 14 grandchildren. And now there are three great-grandchildren. It has required a lot of travel to other states over the years to keep in touch.  
 There was the period when Robyn and her family of six (ages 10 years down to seven months) moved in with us in Winesburg. We had invited them for two to three months while they were making the transition from Alabama back to Ohio. Through a series of circumstances, it turned into three years.  
 There were the deaths of our parents, and all the aunts and uncles. And now here we are at the top of the family heap - in the "back nine" of life.  
 There was a divorce and remarriage thus adding a stepson. And there were the moves from Ohio - first to South Carolina in August of 2013, following daughter Robyn and her family, and finally to North Carolina in 2018.  
 By my calculation that amounts to something like 2,802 columns. And that is enough. Now it's time to write letters to my children and grandchildren.  
 It has been my pleasure over these many decades.  
 Thanks for listening.

Going into 2020, a slew of different types of regulations could make abortion more difficult to access in several states. In Michigan, a measure to ban dilation and evacuation abortions, a common type of second trimester abortions, could appear on the ballot -- organizers said last month that they had submitted more than the necessary number of signatures to be authenticated. In Pennsylvania, legislators introduced a bill in November requiring health care facilities to "cremate or inter the fetal remains" from miscarriages or abortions.
