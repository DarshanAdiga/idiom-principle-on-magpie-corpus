Any concerns depend on an individual's definition of surveillance, a word that carries a nefarious connotation in some corners. In some countries, the effort this year to stem the outbreak of COVID-19 with contact tracing has included citizen consent to location registration.
 Activity at a sporting event in the U.S. would likely only be collected in aggregate, like an elevated skin temperature flagged during a walk through a thermal scanner. That's not a piece of data tied to someone's actual identity that could run afoul of federal privacy laws. Perhaps QR codes will be used for patrons to self-report current health conditions.
 Carrying a smartphone and using it to shop already opens a user to some form of location tracking and direct marketing. Team-sponsored apps allowing fans to order burgers and beers directly to their seats and receive push notifications for merchandise already provide a framework for what could be next.
 “I think the stadiums could probably say, ‘Hey, we’ve got 50 people in the bathroom right now,’ in the aggregate because you already downloaded that app," said Nerissa Coyle McGinn, a Chicago attorney with a practice in advertising, technology and privacy who has worked with sports teams including the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Red Wings and New York Giants. “You’ve agreed to their privacy policy, and sharing aggregate information isn’t considered sharing personal information."
 The algorithms caused a bit of controversy at Alabama, where football coach Nick Saban's frustration with students leaving blowout games early and a nationwide attendance decline prompted establishment of the "Tide Loyalty Points" program that rewarded fans for their fourth quarter presence with prizes and priority purchasing for in-demand events. Bluetooth technology is used in that case for tracking; it's only functional inside Bryant-Denny Stadium.
 “The more information you can give to somebody, the more likely they’re willing to consent to the question of this type of data,” said Nan Sato, a Philadelphia attorney with a focus on the intersection of technology and sports. "Who’s getting the data? How is it being stored and used, how long is the data going to be retained, and how the privacy of the fans is going to be protected?”
 Screening technology that scans a user’s eyes, face or fingerprint has multiplied in recent years, particularly in airports to speed up security lines. Two years ago, Major League Baseball struck a deal with a biometric identification system, Clear, to accelerate ballpark entry by body part — fingerprints, for now, but perhaps one day a fan’s face will serve as his or her ticket.
 “When you kind of pull back the layers, people aren’t fearful of the facial recognition technology itself. They’re fearful of what happens to that data after. It’s more a matter of transparency on our clients’ front: ’Hey, we’re not going to sell this data to a third party. It’s maintained in an encrypted way,” said Shaun Moore, a former SMU football player and the co-founder of Trueface, a software startup with customers in a variety of sectors including sports. “We never see any of the data. We don’t know who’s in the database. So that’s one way we keep privacy in mind when developing these tools. There needs to be transparency in how the data flows and who has access to it, how long it stays in the system. Is it 30 days? Is it two days? Where is it being used?”

Another contemporary example is Arnault's dedication to Marc Jacobs whose own label has underperformed financially for years and is largely propped up by successful fragrances and its relatively new cosmetics line.

D.J. Smith has let his mind wander, if ever so slightly.
 Coming off his first season as an NHL head coach — one cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic — the Ottawa Senators' bench boss has already turned most of his attention to the 2020-21 campaign, whenever it gets off the ground.
 Before that, however, Smith will also be watching with keen interest where the balls bounce at the NHL draft lottery on June 26.
 Ottawa, which has gone through a well-documented period of on- and off-ice turmoil since getting within a double-overtime goal of making the 2017 Stanley Cup final, owns the second- and third-best odds.
 The Senators ranked 30th out of 31 teams when the league paused its season because of the novel coronavirus pandemic March 12, but also possesses the Sharks' first-round selection after dealing captain and star defenceman Erik Karlsson to San Jose in September 2018.
 Detroit has the best singular odds of drafting first at 18.5 per cent, but Ottawa's chances sit at a combined 25 per cent.
 In a perfect world from a Senators' perspective, they would pick first and second, and take winger Alexis Lafreniere followed by centre Quinton Byfield.
 Other combinations are much more likely — hockey Twitter account @IneffectiveMath recently calculated Ottawa's best chances are picking No. 4 and No. 5 — but Smith is really hoping at least one selection falls in the first three.
 "They're saying anyone in the top-3 would be a No. 1 in most other years," the coach said in a phone interview this week. "If you end up with one of them great, you're up and running. If you end up with two of the top-3, they're game-changers."
 The worst case scenario for Ottawa would be picking fifth or sixth, still pretty good in a deep draft class.
 Smith, however, points to the Vancouver Canucks getting Daniel and Henrik at No. 2 and No. 3 in 1999 to illustrate what this lottery could mean in the nation's capital.
 "They changed that franchise," he said.
 Ottawa also owns the New York Islanders' first-round pick — as long as it doesn't fall in the top-3 — and four selections in the second to go along with defenceman Thomas Chabot, winger Brady Tkachuk, centre Colin White and a host of other prospects knocking on the door.
 And while Smith knows there will likely be growing pains with the youngsters the Senators get in a draft that doesn't yet have a firm date, he's excited at the prospect of securing some top-end talent up front.
 "When you can get a couple game-changers on your team, you find ways to win," Smith said. "Those guys have another gear. There's a reason they're rated one, two or three. They do things other people can't do. If you can get one of those guys, great.
 "If you can get two, that makes you a heck of a coach."
 When he isn't dreaming about the draft possibilities, Smith has had plenty of time to look back on his first year as an NHL head coach. He's examined what worked, what didn't and where he can improve heading into Year 2.

“Posting a picture and just taking the day off was like the easiest cop out to show that you are a part of a situation or problem going on in the world,” Porter said.
 It also felt like convenient timing since the COVID-19 pandemic has already disrupted the music industry. Besides touring being on hold, streaming numbers have been down and Porter questions whether fans really want to hear party music from major-label pop stars and mainstream rappers during a period of intense civil unrest on top of a global pandemic.
 “If it's going to be a blackout Tuesday, why not have it be a day where you guys push more prolific or radical black artists?” Porter said, pointing to artists like critically acclaimed rapper/poet Noname. “Why doesn't Spotify for that day make a playlist of black artists present right now who are trying to make a change? I feel like that could've gone so much further than just the blackout.”
 In an Instagram post, New York-via-Seattle jazz progressive Kassa Overall noted how, as a jazz musician, his “life's work is sold beneath the mantle of white ownership on almost every organizational level.” He questioned how substantive the Tuesday blackout really was.
 “It is a nice gesture for music industry partners and well-off white musicians to say that they stand with the black community, but what does that mean?” he wrote. “Are black faces there to add color, used for the optics, for balance and symmetry? Are they only there for the song and dance? Will the people who make the most money off black music correct the artistic and intellectual colonialism that they thrive on? Will they help black people become stakeholders? And why do these issues only seem to matter when white America shows its ass?”
 After doing a little research on #BlackoutTuesday's origins, the statement from #TheShowMustBePaused's organizers resonated with local Americana artist Paula Boggs. The former Starbucks executive and leader of her namesake Paula Boggs Band says she isn't so Pollyannish as to believe all of the black-box posters are sincere. But overall, it felt like a positive step.
 “We are living in one of the most divisive periods in our country's history,” Boggs said. “So a movement that unifies us — even if it's in some ways superficial — is better than not doing it, it seems to me.”
 For Porter, the bigger question is what comes next.
 “The protest and everything's cool right now, but as a Black man, when the dust settles I'm still going to be Black and the issue's still there,” he said. “So what are you going to do after all of this?

The way Cindy Corbett sees it, Gov. Tim Walz gave her a birthday present.
 How else can she explain the fact that she was able to celebrate her 60th birthday at the Monticello VFW with a group of her closest girlfriends- and have adult beverages and hot appetizers to boot!
 Corbett and her husband Gary came across the river from Big Lake to meet with Cindy’s Monticello girlfriends on an afternoon when temperatures reached the mid-90s and the beer on the VFW’s patio was in the 30s.
 For the first time in 11 weeks, Minnesota restaurants were allowed to open on Monday- even if only for outdoor seating and with restrictions.
 The VFW in Monticello was one of the restaurants that chose to open.
 “It went better than expected,” said Christina Lincoln, manager of the VFW.
 “We had good crowds, especially early in the evening,” she said.
 Not every day will be like Monday, Lincoln acknowledges. For example, the 90 degree temperatures on Tuesday, June 2 were met with severe thunderstorms that brought outdoor dining to a halt.
 “We’re going to have to go day by day,” Lincoln said.
 There is also a learning curve going on at many restaurants that opened. For example, many restaurants and bars are not used to having to take reservations, one of the restrictions imposed by the Governor that is designed to help maintain social distancing regulations.
 “It will take a while to learn what works out best for everyone,” Lincoln said.
 Service at the VFW was just fine, as far as Cindy Corbett was concerned.
 A friend of hers in Monticello made reservations and before long, the ladies were catching up like old times.

TORONTO - Ontario Premier Doug Ford says the NHL plans to use private labs to process the COVID-19 tests of players and staff should the league resume play this summer.
 Ford was asked Wednesday whether the burden of testing hockey players would mean less testing capacity for Ontarians if the league resumed with Toronto as one of its hub cities.
 Ford said the NHL has made it clear to him that the league does not want to affect health care for the general populace wherever it resumes play.
 The NHL is working toward a plan to resume the 2019-20 season with 24 teams playing out of two hub cities. Toronto is one of 10 cities shortlisted to act as a hub, along with Vancouver and Edmonton.
 The league has said it plans to test players on a daily basis if play resumes.
 Ford was also asked about an exemption for players from the mandatory 14-day quarantine at the international border, but he said that falls under federal jurisdiction.
 NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly has said the quarantine would take Canadian cities out of the running as hubs if it remained in force during future phases of its return to play plan.
