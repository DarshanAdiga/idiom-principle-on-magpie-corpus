SPRINGFIELD - Last week, I visited seven Springfield stores trying to buy a gallon of milk before finding the last one at a Walgreens.
 Over the weekend, I visited my favorite supermarket and they were out of toilet paper. And Monday, I went to the grocery store near my house and couldn't find an ounce of flour or sugar on the shelves.
 Bleach wipes and hand sanitizer are beginning to feel like items available during a bygone era.
 Beyond a scarcity of hot dog buns on July 4, Americans aren't accustomed to these types of shortages.
 Our free enterprise system is an extraordinarily efficient way of delivering goods and services.
 The shortages we are experiencing today are the result of panic buying created when customers began hoarding goods because they fear the coronavirus pandemic will disrupt supplies of these goods.
 The best way to combat shortages is to ration goods.
 Some stores I shop at post signs limiting how much milk or cleaning supplies a customer can purchase. Unfortunately, such limits can be easily circumvented by making purchases at several stores or having a friend or family member make a separate purchase on your behalf.
 Of course, there are more formal ways of rationing goods. Stuck away in my desk drawer I have ration stamps for sugar and gas that my grandmother saved from World War II. To hear her tell it, that rationing scheme didn't work well at all. And people hated the government telling them what they could or could not buy. And 60 years after the war, she was still complaining about how people would cheat.
 Of course, the normal way the marketplace "rations" is through price. When demand goes up, prices go up. When demand goes down, prices go down.
 When prices are higher people purchase less. When prices are lower people buy more.
 And if the things were working the way the usually do, that's exactly what would be happening now.
 Instead we have lots of empty shelves.
 What went wrong?
 One barrier to the marketplace regulating itself is government intervention.
 In a prepared statement Attorney General Kwame Raoul said, "Now more than ever, it is crucial to put people before profits, and I will not hesitate to use my office's authority to take decisive action against those that deliberately raise the prices of items that are crucial to stopping the spread of the coronavirus. I am committed to collaborating with partners in law enforcement and retail to ensure that businesses do not seize upon this crisis to make money," Raoul said.
 Illinois has weak "price gouging" laws. In fact, only fuel is covered by the state's price gouging statute, Rob Karr, president of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, said.
 Karr added that price increases often are made by wholesalers supplying retailers. But retailers often are blamed by customers for the price jump.
 An executive order filed this month by Gov. JB Pritzker further expanded enforcement of price gouging to include medical and sanitary items used in the fight against the coronavirus said Tori Joseph, a spokesperson for the attorney general. She added the attorney general also can use his civil powers to fine retailers he believes have unfairly increased the prices of other items.
 For the time being, his office is calling retailers, whom customers have complained about unfairly raising prices, and asking them to cut prices.
 But raising and lowering prices is one of the only ways stores can respond to demand.
 One could reasonably argue that stores should have increased prices to reduce demand. For example, a store could charge $14.75 for an 18-roll-pack of toilet paper. But then increase the price to $25 for a second pack and $30 for a third.
 Such a pricing scheme would deter people from hoarding valuable supplies.
 Or instead of charging $3.50 for a gallon of milk, a store could temporarily raise the price to $5 to deter panic buying.
 But would such pricing moves be considered "price gouging?" Who knows? The definition is ambiguous. Here is one internet definition: "Price gouging occurs when a seller increases the prices of goods, services or commodities to a level much higher than is considered reasonable or fair. Usually, this event occurs after a demand or supply shock."
 What's reasonable? What's fair? There really isn't a precise definition.
 "'Price gouging' infers that they are deliberately hurting people. I think a better term for this would be 'scarcity pricing.'" said Joe Lehman, president of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. "Too often sellers are presented as the problem. When hoarders may actually be the cause."
 Lehman's remark rang true to me.
 But won't temporarily increasing prices during a panic create a hardship for some on the fringes? Perhaps. That's why its important to have a safety net of churches, food pantries and government services that can step into the gap.
 No rationing scheme is perfect.
 But one thing is certain, no one is served when stores have empty shelves.

Now that spring has arrived, delightful thoughts come to mind as I think of the magnificent plants that illuminate the garden. I love large shrubs that take center stage but I also adore those early perennials and minor bulbs that brighten smaller spaces. These are ones that are not grown as often, those rarer jewels that need to be lauded. I do not have as many as I would like but some of those that I do grow, I want to sing their praises.      One of the first to break the ground is Ranunculus ficaria "Brazen Hussy," a plant I first saw when visiting a garden in eastern Virginia. This deer- resistant spring perennial emerges with glossy dark burgundy foliage that contrasts well with the cheerful daffodil-yellow flowers. The stark contrast between the foliage and the flowers sets this plant apart and makes it stand out from a distance. I have had it for about 10 years and it comes back each February like clockwork and then it disappears, as the temperatures get warmer. I have read it is invasive but I still have the two plants that I purchased from Plants Delights and it is not invasive where I have them growing.      Bloodroot, (Sanguinaria) is a charming woodland plant that emerges and quickly shows off white flowers that stand out against the brown leaf litter. I also am attracted to the shape of the leaves and find them to be quite attractive and interesting. The leaves grow larger as the summer progresses, sporting deeply cut lobes that are quite eye-catching. This is a North American woodland perennial that is called bloodroot because it has a red sap that oozes from the roots when cut. Native American basket makers used the sap as a source of red dye. However, they did not use it as face paint because it is toxic if rubbed onto the skin.      Many of my gardening friends grow Virginia Bluebells, (Mertensia virginica), a cherished native that delights us in spring with nodding clusters of pink buds that open to sky blue flowers. These charming bell-shaped flowers have cool, soft green foliage making a beautiful display in a shaded area of the garden. You need to enjoy them quickly because as the flowers fade, so does the foliage and, before you know it, they disappear and go dormant until the following spring.      Brunnera has also become a favorite of mine for the shade garden. This trouble-free plant has dainty blue flowers that resemble forget-me-nots. The flowers stand high above the foliage on thin stems that sway in a gentle breeze. The one I grow is called Brunnera "Jack Frost" and was chosen the perennial of the year in 2012 by the Perennial Plant Association. This hardy plant is grown not only for the flowers but also for the veined heart-shaped leaves that are green and white and, if it does not get too hot and dry, they look pretty all summer long. My husband thinks these leaves are caladiums leaves in the summer, a plant he wants me to grow. I do not tell him that those variegated showy leaves are not what he thinks. What he does not know will not hurt him.      Phlox divaricata, a perennial with delightful blue or white flowers, is another woodland native which forms mats of foliage with stems that typically reach 12 inches tall. My friend Pat Burton introduced me to this plant and told me to be sure and purchase the variety called "Blue Moon." It is a lovely native phlox groundcover featuring clouds of rich violet-blue blooms that float above green foliage. It has a slight fragrance to wake up one's senses, and it flowers in March and April where I live. It is a perfect addition to a rock garden or any shady spot where it can slowly naturalize. I have it by a stream and I am hoping that one day, the mats will become large enough that they drape over the rocks lining the stream.      If you like to plant bulbs or corms, you should try planting Erythronium, which is also called Trout Lilies or Dogtooth Violet. I grow one called "Pagoda" which bears graceful sulfur yellow flowers with a reddish-brown ring at the center. The flower is shaped like a tiny lily and the leaves are a beautiful bright green. I grow mine in part shade with rich woodsy soil. These deer and rodent resistant plants only last for a short time because, by late May, the Dogtooth Lilies have gone dormant for the summer.   Think about planting some to brighten up a small space where you want a little something extra. Many of them are called spring ephemerals because the plants last only a brief time. They bloom and die back and go dormant and disappear from view shortly after they stop flowering. I enjoy them and I hope I always have a place for a few in the garden. These early charmers are a joy to grow.      Betty Montgomery is a master gardener and author of "Hydrangeas: How To Grow, Cultivate & Enjoy," and "A Four-Season Southern Garden."

Where To Take A Hike


--DocBreak--
PEOPLE working in the property market are having to get creative on how they can continue the buying, selling and renting of homes with strict new government enforcements to flatten the COVID-19 curve.
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison last night named onsite auctions and house inspections among the list of activities that would be banned from midnight tonight.
 LJ Hooker Byron Bay agent Liam Annesley said his team has been prepping for the past week: “We already put approaches in place asking people the right questions around the virus whether they’ve been travelling, social distancing,” he said.
 “You can do video auctions you can do over the phone (and) … online auctions.”
 He said any meetings and inspections were being carried out on a one-on-one basis and LJ Hooker Byron Bay were following protocols such as social distancing and keeping hands clean.
 “If any (parties) answer yes to any of the questions in regards to the virus, flu or travel it’s immediately no, there is no inspection.”
 Mr Annesley said the phones were steadily ringing about property owners wanting to lease out their homes previously used as short term holiday letting, but this trend had already began when the bushfires started and holiday rentals were affected.
 “They were already down roughly 15 per cent occupancy across the board.
 “Then in the Byron Shire we had a flood not long after that. That was a very short but it had an impact on a lot of properties that were also holiday letting at that peak time.
 “A lot of the (STA) providers are trying to get permanent tenants in a property for a short period of time. I think a lot of them will be coming around to the fact that they may have to currently let their property for 12 months to be able to get through this period of uncertainty.”
 Mr Annesley also gave his “best advice” to homeowners thinking of selling.
 “People selling their property are asking, ‘What’s the silver bullet at the moment?’.
 “There is none. But what you are looking at is just creating a situation for yourself that you’ve got at least a choice if you want to sell or not.
 “That is talking to the banks about what can they can do to help you defer a mortgage.
 “If you have to forward plan to sell your property, look at doing it now – speak to somebody, speak to a professional or a real estate agent and speak to a broker about, ‘What do we have to do in the next six months to make sure that we’ve got the strongest position to sell our home?”.

Even before I looked in the mirror, I knew my face was puffy. It might have had something to do with the fact that I could feel my cheeks touching my eyebrows or maybe that my lips felt like they were the size of eggplants. I knew some women paid good money for lips that looked like mine, but at that moment, I suspected it was probably not a good look for me.      When I finally did take a peak in the mirror, I realized it wasn't just regular old, "I probably slept on my face" puffy. It was more like, "I look like the Pillsbury Doughboy" puffy. It was clear, something dramatic had happened while I slept. It was like the Tooth Fairy had taken out a hit on me.      "What happened to your face?" said my husband when I emerged from the bathroom.      "What do you mean?" I said, feigning ignorance.      "You're all, um, puffy."      "Oh?" I said. "I hadn't noticed."      "Really?" he said.      "OF COURSE NOT," I boomed. "How could I not notice that I woke up looking like a popover?"      He backed up slowly out of the bedroom, realizing this was one land mine he did not want to step on.      "Call the doctor," he shouted from the other room.      I should mention that this wasn't the first time I've had a puffy face. I experienced something similar years ago when I had my kids. When most women get pregnant, their feet swell. For me, it was my face. Of course, this may have had more to do with all the donuts I ate while I was pregnant than the pregnancy itself, but for arguments sake we'll just say it was pregnancy.      However, I was not pregnant now, and unless, by some miracle of middle age magic, wouldn't ever be again, so it clearly wasn't a hormonal thing. I also didn't recall eating anything the day before that I might have had a reaction to, such as blowfish poison, which could leave you looking like an actual blowfish, assuming you didn't die first.      Realizing I couldn't figure this out myself, I scheduled a televisit with my doctor.      "Your face is very puffy," my doctor said to me when she came on screen.      "See, that's why I chose you as my doctor," I said. "Because of your keen observational skills and masterful assessments."      "It's my superpower," she said. "So, what did you eat last night?"      "Nothing out of the ordinary."      "New cosmetics?" she said.      "Nope."      "Well, I'd say it definitely looks like an allergic reaction." She stared at my face in silence for a few moments.      "What did you wear yesterday?" she said.      "Um, a new wool sweater. A Turtleneck."   "Is your neck itchy?"      "Yes, actually, it is." I said. I had been so busy fretting about my puffy face that I hadn't noticed my itchy neck.      "You had an allergic reaction to the wool," she concluded.      "Wow. Okay," I said, recalling how uncomfortable I'd been at the end of the day. "So, that's something new. Are you sure?"      "Did you snore last night?" she asked.      "Actually, I did."      "Well, that's that," she said. "You either had a reaction to the sweater or your husband tried to smother you with a pillow."

Gov. Roy Cooper's announcement Monday that school buildings won't be open until at least May 15 has parents, students and the school system settling in for the long haul.
   
 While schools may be closed for in-person instruction, students have been learning from home, with plans to pick up instructional materials for the next two weeks on Monday.
   
 Henderson County Public Schools also expanded its mobile lunch program, Meals on the Bus, from two to six routes.
   
 The Meals on the Bus mobile food site now operates six buses, and includes additions to existing routes based on needs the school system continues to identify in the community.
   
 The grab-and-go meals are available at no cost to children ages 2 to 18.
   
 The routes are mostly in low-income neighborhoods, but the expansion now adds stops at notable locations such as the Boys and Girls Club of Henderson County, the N.C. Justice Academy in Edneyville and some churches.
   
 Renee Shipley, a child nutrition assistant, was helping hand out food on Bus 1, which largely covers neighborhoods in East Flat Rock. When the bus driver honks, children and parents come out to pick up their meals.
   
 Shipley explained the new route and times to parents, periodically checking in to see how they are holding up.
   
 "I know that the kids are anxious to get back to school," Shipley said. "They tell us every day that they want to go back; I guess more for structure than anything. I haven't got any kids saying they're excited about being at home."
   
 Parent Teresa Penley in Dodd Meadows said the meals have helped tremendously since one of her children is normally in school.
   
 "We're good," Penley said when asked how her family was holding up, "minus having to home school."
   
 That's the biggest concern Shipley has heard on her route from parents - that they are not teachers.
   
 "They don't know how to be a teacher to the kids and it's hard in that aspect for the parents to try and teach their kids and then work, if they are able to work, at the same time," Shipley said. "They would like for the kids to go back to school as well."
   
 "My generation, I know I've never had to go through anything like this before," Shipley added. "It's just a shock for everybody."
   
 Bianca Gonzalez was with her son picking up a lunch in King Creek. Gonzalez works two jobs, one in the nursing field. Because of that Gonzalez said she has been cut off from her other job while her nursing job is trying to ask her to work more hours.

 Gonzalez said the meals help give her son a little extra to eat.
   
 "We don't get food stamps or anything like that and nothing else, really, so it helps us out quite a lot," she said. "It kind of keeps us able to stay at home or at least close to home so we don't have to go to big stores and get him sick."

 Staying at home is the prudent course of action to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
 Yet we Americans are not used to responding to a national emergency by doing nothing. It's in our nature to act and act decisively when things are not going well.
 People around the state have found a way to act and at the same time minimize their risk of contracting COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. Their hearts are big and they want to help as many people as they can as we shelter in place.
 The Northwest Illinois Community Action Coalition, formed to help people in Rockford, Loves Park, Freeport, Roscoe, Rockton and East Dubuque, assists those who need help shopping, walking pets and taking them to the veterinarian, and picking up medication.
 The group is led by Freeport residents Carl Utt, Ed Klein and Jody Coss.
 In Springfield, the Springfield Families Helping Families Facebook page was started by Scott McFarland. McFarland, a member of the Springfield District 186 School Board and director of Illinois' Commission on Volunteerism, saw Facebook as a way to connect people who wanted to help and those who need help.
 You don't have to belong to an organized group to help. Rockford Register Star carrier Ken Bragg put notes in newspapers offering to shop and pick up food for the customers on his route. That's an especially helpful service for elderly people who are not very mobile and fear getting sick.
 Many of you are understandably nervous about leaving the house no matter how good the intention. You don't have to and you can still make a difference.
 A simple phone call to an elderly neighbor or a family member who is confined to a nursing home or an assisted living center can do wonders for their morale and yours. Let them know they are not alone.
 Another gesture you can offer from the safety of your home: Write thank-you notes. Remember those who deliver your mail, your packages and your newspaper. They are out there every day.
 If you are willing to venture out, offer to buy groceries for those who are shut in. Remember to wash your hands before and after your excursion. It's also recommended that you wash the clothes you wore while you were shopping.
 It's also a good time to reconnect with someone you haven't talked to in a while. Friendship can continue even when we can't interact on a face-to-face basis. Facetime, Zoom and other technologies can help you see the person you're talking to and make it feel like a more intimate experience.
 Small businesses operate on tight profit margins in the best of times and these, obviously, are not the best of times.
 Consider ordering takeout or delivery from your favorite local restaurant. The Food and Drug Administration says there is no evidence that the virus can spread through food or food packaging. Please tip the delivery person well; it is a tough job.
 Still, we understand if you consider that a risk. Instead, order a gift card from one of those businesses that can be used once things return to normal. You can do that by phone or online and never have to leave the house. You'll be helping local businesses when they need the business most and you'll have something to look forward to so you can treat yourself.

Yolanda Ogunbowale was born too soon.
 In her high school days, you knew her as Yolanda or "Londy" Block, who remains one of the greatest all-around athletes in NIC-10 history.
 At Harlem High School in the fall, she was a first-team all-conference volleyball player her senior year, leading the Huskies to a tie for first place. In the winter, she was a second-team all-conference basketball player as a junior and first-teamer as a senior, leading Harlem to second-place finishes behind Freeport both years.
 But she dominated the most in the spring. From 1978 through 1980, Block was the star pitcher for a Harlem program that went 61-5 in that span. The Huskies finished second in the state in Block's junior year and then rolled to the first softball state title in conference history her senior year with a 25-0 record.
 Block was 37-3 over those three years with at least 417 strikeouts in 238 innings -- high school baseball and softball records are notoriously difficult to find. She also led Harlem in hitting as a sophomore and senior.
 The dominance continued in college. Yolanda went to DePaul, where she was North Star All-Conference in 1984 and 1985, including being the conference offensive MVP in 1985. In her senior year, she won 16 games, struck out 135 batters, hit .295 and drove in 35 runs.
 Then … her career was over.
 "There were no opportunities to keep playing back then," Ogunbowale said in a telephone interview from Milwaukee. "In basketball, you could maybe go play overseas, although the money wasn't that great. In softball, it really wasn't until Jennie Finch came along that opportunities started to open up."
 Finch was a two-time Olympian and her popularity helped the Women's Pro Fastpitch league establish itself in the United States.
 "The women from my era, we had to get jobs and raise families," Ogunbowale said.
 She proved to be pretty good at that, too.
 Ogunbowale moved to Milwaukee and became an elementary school teacher. That's where she met her husband, Greg, an elementary school principal. They had two sons and a daughter. One son, Mario, works in the catering industry. The other, Dare, is a running back for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
 "He just called me. 'Mom, we got Tom Brady,'" she said.
 Her daughter is her daily reminder of how much bigger the world is for female athletes.
 Arike Ogunbowale grew up playing soccer and basketball. She showed no interest in softball.
 She was heavily recruited by dozens of Division I colleges for both sports. She eventually settled on basketball and Notre Dame. In her junior year, she made a last-second, game-winning shot in the NCAA semifinals to beat the storied UConn Huskies and then followed it up with a last-second, game-winning shot to beat Mississippi State in the finals.
 Arike became an overnight, crossover sensation. She appeared on "Dancing With the Stars" and "The Ellen Show," where she was surprised by her childhood idol, Kobe Bryant.
 After Arike's senior year, she was the No. 5 pick in the WNBA draft. She played with the Dallas Wings last year, averaging 19.1 points in 32 games. She was playing a winter season in Turkey until her season was canceled.
 "There's so much more exposure now when it comes to women's sports," Yolanda said. "It's more than that. There's so much more support. When we were growing up, we didn't have personal trainers. Arike has trainers that follow her around. We just had our teammates. People didn't open the gym for us so we get could more shots up. People cater to her needs. We just played in local leagues. Every weekend, Arike was in a tournament out of state in basketball and soccer against the best players in the country.
 "We talk about this all the time. That Harlem team (in 1980) was really great. We had so many good players. If we had access to the training the girls have now, we would have been huge."

Staying at home is the prudent course of action to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
 Yet we Americans are not used to responding to a national emergency by doing nothing. It's in our nature to act and act decisively when things are not going well.
 People around the state have found a way to act and at the same time minimize their risk of contracting COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. Their hearts are big and they want to help as many people as they can as we shelter in place.
 The Northwest Illinois Community Action Coalition, formed to help people in Rockford, Loves Park, Freeport, Roscoe, Rockton and East Dubuque, assists those who need help shopping, walking pets and taking them to the veterinarian, and picking up medication.
 The group is led by Freeport residents Carl Utt, Ed Klein and Jody Coss.
 In Springfield, the Springfield Families Helping Families Facebook page was started by Scott McFarland. McFarland, a member of the Springfield District 186 School Board and director of Illinois' Commission on Volunteerism, saw Facebook as a way to connect people who wanted to help and those who need help.
 You don't have to belong to an organized group to help. Rockford Register Star carrier Ken Bragg put notes in newspapers offering to shop and pick up food for the customers on his route. That's an especially helpful service for elderly people who are not very mobile and fear getting sick.
 Many of you are understandably nervous about leaving the house no matter how good the intention. You don't have to and you can still make a difference.
 A simple phone call to an elderly neighbor or a family member who is confined to a nursing home or an assisted living center can do wonders for their morale and yours. Let them know they are not alone.
 Another gesture you can offer from the safety of your home: Write thank-you notes. Remember those who deliver your mail, your packages and your newspaper. They are out there every day.
 If you are willing to venture out, offer to buy groceries for those who are shut in. Remember to wash your hands before and after your excursion. It's also recommended that you wash the clothes you wore while you were shopping.
 It's also a good time to reconnect with someone you haven't talked to in a while. Friendship can continue even when we can't interact on a face-to-face basis. Facetime, Zoom and other technologies can help you see the person you're talking to and make it feel like a more intimate experience.
 Small businesses operate on tight profit margins in the best of times and these, obviously, are not the best of times.
 Consider ordering takeout or delivery from your favorite local restaurant. The Food and Drug Administration says there is no evidence that the virus can spread through food or food packaging. Please tip the delivery person well; it is a tough job.
 Still, we understand if you consider that a risk. Instead, order a gift card from one of those businesses that can be used once things return to normal. You can do that by phone or online and never have to leave the house. You'll be helping local businesses when they need the business most and you'll have something to look forward to so you can treat yourself.

Levinson disappeared on March 9, 2007, when he was scheduled to meet a source on the Iranian island of Kish. For years, U.S. officials would only say that Levinson was working independently on a private investigation.But a 2013 Associated Press investigation revealed that Levinson had in fact been sent on a mission by CIA analysts who had no authority to run such an operation.“Those who are responsible for what happened to Bob Levinson, including those in the U.S. government who for many years repeatedly left him behind, will ultimately receive justice for what they have done," the family statement said.The family received proof-of-life photos and a video in late 2010 and early 2011, but his whereabouts and fate were not known.In November, the Iranian government unexpectedly responded to a United Nations query by saying that Levinson was the subject of an “open case” in Iranian Revolutionary Court. Though the development gave the family a burst of hope, Iran clarified that the “open case” was an investigation into his disappearance.The announcement of his death comes just weeks after a federal judge in Washington held Iran liable for his disappearance, saying the country was “in no uncertain terms” responsible for Levinson’s “hostage taking and torture.”Copyright 2020 Associated Press.
