Keith found out about this at the last minute, 30 minutes before he was going to start the training. He told us he was going to cancel the training because it wouldn’t be right to go forward under the circumstances. He proceeded to address the group of 104 attendees and told them what had happened (not blaming or outing those of us that caused the problem) and that it was his fault for the mistake. He took on the burden of facing an angry group of men and taking responsibility as the leader to take it on the chin. He offered to give back $150,000 in training fees to the members as well as damages for time and travel costs. He said he would give the men what they felt was fair for damages, and he honored his promise.

This was the most humbling experience of my life to this point, to see someone stand up for a principle that I was too weak to uphold. It felt terrible and inspiring all at once. It truly transformed my life and how I would approach my goals in the future, to not cut corners, to keep my integrity and do the right thing regardless of the material cost.

This is in direct contradiction to the testimony of Mark Vicente, who testified that Keith walked out of that training and left us to take it on the chin. This event and Mark Vicente’s lie can be proven because the event was captured on video.
