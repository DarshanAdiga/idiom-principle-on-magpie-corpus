 # At least 13 people drown in migrant shipwreck off Libya
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Cairo_ ‚Äì Over a dozen migrants trying to reach Europe drowned in the Mediterranean Sea when their small dinghy capsized off the coast of Libya, the United Nations reported Friday, the latest shipwreck to underscore the deadly risks facing those who flee the war-afflicted North African country.
 Libyan fishermen spotted the sinking boat late Thursday, said the International Organization for Migration, and managed to pull 22 people from the water, including those from Egypt, Bangladesh, Syria, Somalia and Ghana.
 But at least 13 of the other passengers were missing and presumed drowned. Three dead bodies were found floating in the water, including one Syrian man and woman. The boat had set off from the town of Zliten, east of the Libyan capital of Tripoli, late on Wednesday.
 The Libyan Coast Guard said that it had ordered the rescue, and that search teams were scouring the area for more victims.
 ‚ÄúSo many boats are leaving these days, but autumn is a very difficult season,‚Äù said Commodore Masoud Abdal Samad. ‚ÄúWhen it gets windy, it‚Äôs deadly. It changes in an instant.‚Äù
 Following the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, Libya has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants hoping to get to Europe from Africa and the Middle East. Smugglers often pack desperate families into ill-equipped rubber boats that stall and founder along the perilous Central Mediterranean route. At least 20,000 people have died in those waters since 2014, according to the U.N.
 Those who survived Friday‚Äôs disaster were taken to the Tripoli port, where they received medical care for their burns, a common consequence of leaked engine fuel mixing with saltwater, said Safa Msehli, an IOM spokeswoman.
 Libyan authorities shepherded the survivors to the Zliten detention center, run by the Tripoli-based government‚Äôs Interior Ministry. Migrants rescued at sea and returned to Libya routinely land in detention centers notorious for torture, extortion and abuse. Amnesty International revealed in a report Thursday that thousands of migrants have been forcibly disappeared from unofficial militia-run detention centers.
 The shipwreck, the second to be recorded by the U.N. in as many weeks, ‚Äúsignals the need now more than ever for state-led search and rescue capacity to be redeployed and the need to support NGO vessels operating in a vacuum,‚Äù said Msehli.
 Since 2017, European countries, particularly Italy, have delegated most search-and-rescue responsibility to the Libyan Coast Guard, which intercepts migrant boats before they can reach European waters. Activists have lamented that European authorities are increasingly blocking the work of nongovernmental rescue organizations that patrol the Mediterranean and seek to disembark at European ports.

After 20 years, Stella and Simon are at a precipice in their relationship. She‚Äôs a respected nurse at a Manhattan hospital; he‚Äôs a musician who‚Äôs spent decades chasing fame. Now in their early 40s, they‚Äôre not sure if they‚Äôre still in love. In the first chapter of Caroline Leavitt‚Äôs ninth novel, _With or Without You_ , a night spent drinking wine and arguing about their future ends in disaster when Stella ‚Äî longing to recapture her heady youth ‚Äî pops an unidentified pill from Simon‚Äôs pocket and falls into a coma.
  _With or Without You_ (Algonquin Books, 2020, 288 pages, $26.95) is the story of what happens next, as Simon sits by Stella‚Äôs hospital bed, and Stella, from deep within the recesses of consciousness, struggles to make sense of her mysterious situation. It‚Äôs a redemption tale anchored in a medical chronicle, threaded with the finest filaments of magical realism. Starting from a point of stasis, Leavitt pushes her characters toward profound personal change.
 Even though its subject matter could be considered a bit depressing in any other summer, the novel might be included in lists of ‚Äúbeach reads.‚Äù In the chaos of 2020, however, the story of a coma patient and her bereft life partner has an unexpected lightness. Its release is perfectly timed for backyard reading during a global pandemic.
 Leavitt embraces this idea and is excited for people to read her book whether they‚Äôre looking for something to reflect their current emotional reality or as a means to mentally escape from it.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in how regular people handle it when terrible things happen,‚Äù Leavitt, 68, says from her home in Hoboken, New Jersey. ‚ÄúTo me, you always have a choice. You can curl up and withdraw from society, or you can fight.‚Äù
 During Stella‚Äôs ordeal, Simon must reevaluate his musical career, as well as his life. He‚Äôs mired in old hurts handed to him from his parents, and his relentless yearning for success as defined by a stadium full of screaming fans.
 Leavitt calls that an immature dream. As a writer whose books have sometimes been met with lukewarm sales and critical response, she‚Äôs learned that the only way to pursue her art is to forget about fame. ‚ÄúI think if you‚Äôre doing a creative career just to be successful, then you‚Äôre probably doing it for the wrong reasons. And that‚Äôs what I wanted to Simon [to learn].‚Äù
  _Star Tribune_ reviewer and author Marion Winik writes that in another novelist‚Äôs hands, ‚Äúthese bougie New York types might have been subject to a touch of satire,‚Äù but Leavitt approaches their troubles without irony. Winik follows this assertion with a cutting but apt observation about the book‚Äôs third main character, Stella‚Äôs best friend Libby, who ‚Äúwas planning never to recover from the childhood trauma she sublimated into her work as a doctor.‚Äù Libby is a hyper-grounded woman who nevertheless struggles for stability in her intimate relationships. She initially mistrusts Simon and assumes he won‚Äôt care for Stella when she needs him most. Stella is saddled with childhood baggage as well. All three find growth as they learn to look at the past with adult eyes.
 This is the second novel that Leavitt has written about a woman in a coma. The first, _Coming Back to Me_ (2001), was based more directly on Leavitt‚Äôs own experience of being put into a medically induced coma after giving birth to her son when she was in her early 40s. Though labor went smoothly, shortly afterward, her body began producing a protein that stopped her blood from clotting. At first, the doctors didn‚Äôt know what was happening, so the coma was induced for her safety. They brought her out after several weeks ‚Äî and full physical recovery took a year. Her memories of the time continued to haunt her. While in the coma, she says, ‚ÄúAll the colors were black and white. I was sure that I had gone into some sort of parallel world and that everything before in my life had been false, and this was real. And I had to get out, but I didn‚Äôt know how.‚Äù
 After the coma, Leavitt developed post-traumatic stress disorder. Random smells and sights, reminiscent of the hospital, triggered panic attacks. A psychiatrist advised her to write about it.
 ‚ÄúI wrote about a woman who was just like me. She has a baby, starts bleeding, goes into this coma. The book did okay, but I still had the problems. I decided I would have to learn to live with it,‚Äù Leavitt says. But the issues kept resurfacing. Five years ago, while her husband was away on a business trip, she stopped sleeping. A new therapist suggested she‚Äôd written the wrong book.
 ‚ÄúShe said I should write about someone who was totally different from me and relive it through her memories. She said I should think of it like hypnosis. So, in her coma, I had Stella remember everything. As I was writing it, I started to feel lighter, to feel this sense of wonder. Through Stella, I could have some control, and it wasn‚Äôt terrifying. And when she came out of the coma, she got to be a brand-new person.‚Äù
  _With or Without You_ offers an appealing resolution during a time when many of us are experiencing a complex mix of lockdown fatigue and mounting discomfort over social and political situations. Through trauma and its recovery, Leavitt says, it‚Äôs possible to remake one‚Äôs self. In Leavitt‚Äôs version of this path, Stella awakens with artistic talent that she didn‚Äôt have before ‚Äî a possibility Leavitt learned about by talking to a brain researcher. ‚ÄúHe told me about a woman who woke up speaking fluent Mandarin who hadn‚Äôt spoken any language other than English. Another guy woke up and asked for a violin and was playing like a virtuoso, even though he‚Äôd never played an instrument before. The scientist said they don‚Äôt know why this happens sometimes. They just know that it happens. Brains rewire.‚Äù ‚óÄ

Let's just say, there are some mighty big swings, in both directions. I'm not exactly sure how one could coherently account for all of them. I feel quite confident saying that Donald Trump will not get nearly 20% of the Black vote - every other poll tops him out at nine or ten percent, which I think is a tad high but plausible - and I have no idea how the 35 to 49 contingent could go from being a decent Biden plurality to a significant Trump majority. By the same token, Biden cutting a thirty-one point deficit among white women to ten points seems like a stretch. The most likely explanation in all this is some small sample size weirdness, and as such it's not worth putting too much energy into trying to figure it all out. It is what it is, and if we're lucky Quinnipiac will do an October poll, which will either see things revert back to what we have mostly seen before, or present us with more of a puzzle. I don't know what else to say.

Sponsorships are 30 percent of what they were last year, but we hope to maintain our level of income at our auctions,‚Äù says Greg O‚ÄôByrne, executive director of SFWCF. Even so, the Fiesta decided to push forward with the adjusted 2020 event. ‚ÄúThe real impetus for us was to keep our audience engaged with our wineries and our restaurants, even though this is a very unusual time.‚Äù
 Odd as they may sound, virtual tasting events are in vogue across the United States as safe ways to sample alcohol at home and not in a crowded bar or tasting room. David Ramey, owner of Ramey Wine Cellars in Healdsburg, California, has used virtual tastings as a lifeline during the pandemic. ‚ÄúThis is the way the wine business is being done. I hold two or three or four virtuals a week,‚Äù Ramey says. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a brand like ours, around 60 percent of our sales are on-premises.‚Äù With restaurants struggling, wineries have relied more on direct-to-consumer sales, Ramey added.
 This year, SFWCF has 24 partner wineries, only about a quarter the number of vintners that usually participate in the event. SFWCF runs its tastings over Zoom as webinars. Guests can register online and then pick up their wine at the Inn and Spa at Loretto. Tastings range in price from $50 to $295 and include enough wine samples for four to eight people. Each tasting kit comes with three bottles of wine selected for the seminar and a complimentary bottle of Champagne Palmer Brut. All told, the cost of the three bottles is a little less than retail. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really getting a really great deal here on the wine,‚Äù O‚ÄôByrne says. SFWCF is preparing 200 kits for the event, roughly eight kits per winery.
 Webinars are led by a winemaker and hosted by a guest sommelier. The chat function allows guests to ask questions in real-time. On the surface, these tastings may seem less personal, but there are some advantages. ‚ÄúIt is quite remarkable because although people are in different locations, it feels somehow intimate,‚Äù says Beth Novak Milliken, president & CEO of Spottswoode Estate Vineyard & Winery. ‚ÄúSuch nice connections are made through this format, you can feel everyone‚Äôs appreciation at the opportunity to come together and share wonderful wines and experiences.‚Äù
 Ramey enjoys the convenience and simplicity of virtual tastings. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to go anywhere, you don‚Äôt have to dress up,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou might put a nice top on, but if you‚Äôre wearing your undershorts down below, that‚Äôs OK, because people only see your face.‚Äù
 O‚ÄôByrne was also able to book a guest he‚Äôs wanted for years, thanks to the convenience of Zoom. ‚ÄúBobby Stuckey is the owner of Frasca Restaurant in Boulder, Colorado. He was the sommelier at French Laundry for 15 years prior to that.‚Äù French Laundry is one of the most awarded and recognized restaurants in California. ‚ÄúEvery year, I try to get him to come down to Wine & Chile, but he‚Äôs just too busy running his restaurant. This year as soon as I asked, he said, ‚ÄòYeah. I can do that.‚Äô ‚Äù Stuckey conducted a tasting of the wines of Friuli, a region of Northeastern Italy.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre encouraging people to get a little watch party at home. You get four bottles of wine and if you brought six friends to your house, you could all watch together and taste the wines,‚Äù O‚ÄôByrne says. He also hopes that people stay tuned after tastings on Friday, Sept. 25, at 6:45 p.m. for the live auction that includes 30 lots of items like rare wines, private meals with famed chefs, and wine tasting trips to the West Coast.
 SFWCF also uses Zoom webinars for cooking classes. On Saturday, Sept. 26, James Beard Award-winning writer Cheryl Alters Jamison addresses methods for making great brisket and appetizers. The class costs $35.
 For those who would much rather taste in person, participating restaurants offer a selection of wines from a single winemaker or winemaking region. Wines are introduced by a local vendor. Typically, meals include four courses, each of which is accompanied by a wine sampling. Some restaurants are playing around with the format. Izanami, for instance, is holding a wine vs. sake tasting.
 In some ways, the meals are the most integral part of the Fiesta, because they show off Santa Fe‚Äôs fine eateries. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to us, it‚Äôs a marketing event Wine & Chile,‚Äù O‚ÄôByrne says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a nonprofit and we‚Äôre really trying to promote Santa Fe as a culinary destination.‚Äù ‚óÄ

 (Boston, MA) -- A 54-year-old construction worker is dead and his love of black liquorice might be one of the causes. The unidentified Massachusetts man ate about one and a half bags of the candy each day. He went into cardiac arrest at a fast food restaurant and was rushed to the hospital. Tests there revealed he had dangerously low levels of potassium and a key acid that is part of the liquorice. Doctors said that acid can cause the body's mineral levels to get out of sync. Even a small amount of liquorice can raise blood pressure. Here's the complete story from the Press Herald.

It could also stop us from thinking about irritating odd jobs like figuring out how much powder or how many tablets to throw in to each wash or the panic of running out of detergent altogether. Yes, we will still have to load the clothes ourselves but everything else is handled in the background via the WashPass by Candy system: automatic and personalised reordering of detergent tanks, maintenance of the smart washing machine.
 Subscribing to your washing machine might sound a bit odd at first glance but it's where the smart home is heading. Candy sees it as a logical extension of its brand values of building smart and accessible technology for the home, with a bit of Italian flair thrown into the designs for good measure.

Foster City officials have struck a verbal agreement with the owner of an affordable housing complex that would allow tenants facing displacement to stay in their homes for one additional year.
 The tenants, which include low-income seniors with disabilities and families, faced displacement from their homes at Foster‚Äôs Landing Apartments by the end of this year. They may now be able to stay in their homes at least through December of 2021.
 ‚ÄúThe most important thing is to give peace of mind to these folks. I can‚Äôt imagine the stress they‚Äôre under,‚Äù said Councilman Sam Hindi. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very hard to move now with the pandemic and everything going on.‚Äù
 Hindi noted city staff are still vetting the terms of the agreement that would then need council approval before becoming a done deal.
 Located at 700 Bounty Drive, Foster‚Äôs Landing Apartments is owned by Essex Property Trust, which entered into agreement with the city in 1986 to rent 15% of the 490 units in the complex at below-market rates for a few decades.
 That deal is now expiring in phases, which means the below-market rental rates by the end of the year will rise to market rates. For some residents, that means a rent hike from as little as $500 per month to as much as $2,300 per month ‚Äî far more than they can afford.
 Several tenants spoke about their situation at a meeting Monday before they were aware of the potential one-year extension on the rent hike.
 ‚ÄúIf there is no solution, I‚Äôm going to find myself at the end of this year in the streets. This is the reality,‚Äù said tenant Abder Rahim, who said he suffers from a disability and lives in the complex with his three children and only Social Security income to support them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing my best to look for another place, but there is no way. I keep applying and there is no way.‚Äù
 Matt Cohen said his ‚Äúextremely low-income‚Äù 90-year-old grandparents who‚Äôve lived in the complex for 20 years are in a similar position.
 ‚ÄúAll they want to do is spend the rest of their lives in Foster City, but unfortunately it looks like it‚Äôs not going to happen at this point,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEveryone they know is there, their doctors are there, their caretakers are there. There‚Äôre no other options for them.‚Äù
 Hindi said the affordability covenant for the complex will still expire by the end of this year and rents will go to market rates, but Essex and the city will split the difference between the current and market rates. The residents for the next year will continue to pay exactly the same rent they‚Äôre paying now, he confirmed.
 The additional year will allow tenants more time to find a new home and staff more time to assist with the process.
 The city over the summer put out a request for proposals from tenant relocation providers to help the tenants, but a contract has not yet been signed.
 Staff expects the services to cost roughly $250,000 though Essex has agreed to cover half of the cost, bringing the city‚Äôs total to $125,000. The money will be allocated from affordable housing funds.
 The council will consider the extension on the below-market rate rents in October.
