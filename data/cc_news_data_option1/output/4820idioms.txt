Not only did the team use these tools to bring Monkey Island's various assets to life, but they even got some practice in for creating assets on a few other games, like Sam & Max Hit the Road.

In my Tumbuka people’s traditional Zambian cuisine, I was thinking, “We never eat raw, green leaves randomly picked from the bushes. I was not the village goats that grazed on grass and bushes. I herded goats as a boy! Every vegetable was cooked.”


  My hosts apologized and thought I would enjoy the rest of the dinner. Indeed, I enjoyed the delicious turkey, pumpkin pie and mashed potatoes, which were closest to my Zambian nshima staple meal that is cooked from corn meal.


  Back in my campus dorm room that night, I thanked my mother. The salad incident could have gone really badly, where I would have embarrassed myself and humiliated my hosts. But my mother had taught all nine siblings really well. She said when you are a guest of people with a different household, tribe or culture and, especially food, taste it a little if you can, or decline politely if you cannot bring yourself to take a small bite. My behavior that night went a long way in creating a good and warm relationship with the family from which I benefited in graduate school 10,000 miles away from my own home and family.


  Many decades later, surprisingly, I have accumulated numerous warm memories of family Thanksgiving dinners. One Thanksgiving, my wife had to be away to attend to a family emergency. Going to a restaurant for Thanksgiving with my three kids was out of the question. We were going to use my wife’s grandmother’s “Joy of Cooking” old, well-used cookbook to cook the turkey the way my wife, her mother and her grandmother had cooked it every Thanksgiving for decades.

Sweden is getting on board India's Venus orbiter mission 'Shukrayaan' with a scientific instrument to explore the planet. Ambassador of Sweden to India, Klas Molin said Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) is engaged in the venture, its second collaborative project with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).


  "IRF's satellite instrument Venusian Neutrals Analyzer (VNA) will study how the charged particles from the Sun interact with the atmosphere and exosphere of the planet", he told PTI. "The new Venus mission means that the collaboration between IRF and ISRO continues".


  The VNA would be the ninth generation of IRFs series of miniatured ion and ENA (Energetic Neutral Atoms) instruments, according to Swedish officials. The first generation was named SARA (Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer) and was launched on board the Indian spacecraft Chandrayaan-1 that explored the Moon in 2008-2009.

From steals to forcing backcourt violations and five-second calls, defense is the biggest source of pride for the Beaver Dam girls basketball team.
 The Golden Beavers have hung their hat on a sound, chaotic scheme that throws the best teams out of whack. The same well-oiled machine was again running on all cylinders on Tuesday night at Portage High School as they opened the 2020-21 season with a convincing 96-16 win over Portage.
 Beaver Dam forced 39 takeaways, including 26 in a near scoreless first half, to race past the Warriors and pick up where left off last season.
 “It’s just been a great start to the year for us. I think the kids just are looking for an opportunity to play. We have a great senior class and a bunch of young kids that want to do whatever they can to make their season special,” Beaver Dam coach Tim Chase said.

 Ugh.
 It appears some semblance of normalcy for area athletes will now return to COVID-19 hell as we brace ourselves for another potentially long shutdown.
 As someone who competed as a Redwood Valley Cardinal many moons ago, my heart goes out to the kids of this pandemic era who have had a lot taken away from them because of this deadly outbreak.
 Leaving the politics aside, again, this is just an unfortunate set of circumstances for a young group of kids who will never have this opportunity again.
 I feel for the Redwood Valley girls volleyball team, a group led by six talented seniors - Sydney Sommers, Hannah Schjenken, Haley Garman, Sydney Mertens, AJ Guggisberg and Aubree Hicks - who were 8-3 (two of those losses to unbeaten Marshall) this season as I write this and previously were 50-23 overall since their sophomore season.
 Could they have gotten past Marshall (9-0) or New London/Spicer (9-3) in the Section 3AA playoffs?
 We'll never get to know now.
 That group is also going to suffer the effects of possibly no winter sports season. The group would've returned a healthy Sommers, and Garman with a big year was in line to surpass Celestine Frank for number one all-time in career scoring.
 That almost undoubtedly will not happen now and that's a shame.
 The Redwood Valley football team put together a solid COVID shortened season but will not have the chance to compete at the state tournament.
 It will be the end of the line for veteran senior standouts like Carter Johnson, Logan Josephson, Jaxon Lang and others who won't get that chance to give Blue Earth Area another run and had to settle for a match-up with TMB to end the season Nov. 20.
 Don't get me wrong.
 For a fall sports season that seemed doomed in August, it was great to have any action at all, but it wasn't the same.
 Now, it appears the winter sports season is in serious jeopardy. It could be a long winter.

 Remarkably, the NFL season has managed to go forward with relatively little trouble.
 While COVID has definitely not spared the league, it has been able to manage it well enough to continue to play games weekly as we head into the final half of the season.
 The Vikings - left for dead a month ago - have quietly crept back into the playoff conversation thanks to three straight division wins.
 Rick Spielman was proven right by giving Dalvin Cook an extension before the season as he has lit up the league and has helped the Vikings get back on track.
 People forget, the Vikes lost one point games to Tennessee and Seattle.
 Win those and they would be 6-3 and right on track to potentially grab a top three seed.
 The NFC seems surprisingly feeble this year.
 Who is the best team? Green Bay? Seattle? Arizona? Tampa Bay?
 The Vikings beat Green Bay at Lambeau, and choked away a win at Seattle. Arizona should be 5-4, and Tampa Bay barely beat the Giants and lost to Chicago.
 Of any year I can remember in recent memory, this is the year you want to just get into the postseason and see what happens.
 Tank for Trevor?
 That was never gonna happen folks.
 The Jets might just go 0-16.

 Finally, it was a great year for golf all over the state but especially around here at the Redwood Falls Golf Club and Dacotah Ridge Golf Club.
 Ryan Fernelius did a great job of restoring the Redwood Falls Golf Club back to some normalcy and has it back on track while superintendent John \"Woody\" Wodash took advantage of a great summer weather wise to get a ton of stuff done on the course and had it looking amazing all year long.
 Tyler Pendleton does a great job out at Dacotah Ridge and has that track as one of the top public draws in the state.
 Speaking of Dacotah Ridge, late this summer, former Redwood Valley grad and now local teacher Logan Swann recorded an ace on the par-4, 369 yard first hole during a tournament held there.

Despite completely dismantling two undefeated prospects in his two UFC victories, Buckley has a way to go before being considered a contender in the world’s best MMA organization. Kasanganay and Wright were both ranked well outside the top 40 of current active UFC middleweights despite their respective undefeated records. To reach contender status, a UFC fighter should need multiple wins against the top 25 of a division’s roster while also showing consistent improvement with every performance. Thus far, Buckley has shown he has immense power and a wild willingness to engage in all-out brawls with the opponents he faces. While that may work when facing the lower tier of competition in the UFC, it will certainly not fly against the top 15 or even the top 25 of the roster, all of whom are vastly experienced and well-rounded fighters with numerous weapons in their arsenals. Thus, Buckley’s focus should now be on further developing his MMA well-roundedness as he prepares to face tougher competition in his future UFC bouts.

Out to get Arshad Warsi's activist leader, Mahie Gill's cop zeroes in on a prisoner, played by Bhumi Pednekar. To get her to toe the line, she is taken to the Durgamati haveli, only to find out that the palace has more secrets than earlier imagined.Watch Durgamati trailer here As Durgamati's ghost takes over, jump scares rule the roost in this latest offering from producers Akshay Kumar and Bhushan Kumar. Akshay recently headlined the horror film Laxmii with a similar theme.Durgamati underwent a name change recently. Earlier titled Durgavati, it has now been named Durgamati The Myth. No reason has been given for the name change. The film also stars Jisshu Sengupta and Karan Kapadia in prominent roles, and is written and directed by Ashok.Durgamati was earlier titled Durgavati.The new Durgamati poster and teaser had Bhumi looking dishevelled with partially rubbed off bindi and dressed in a period costume and jewellery. The shoot is set in a dilapidated haveli and a throne-like chair. "Aa rahi hai... Durgamati," the actor wrote with it, while Akshay's post teased the revenge theme of the film.In October, Bhumi had shared a poster in which she is sitting in front of a door with a pair of eyes on it. "What's behind that door? You will know soon, Durgavati releasing worldwide,11th December 2020 on @primevideoin," Bhumi wrote in the caption.Durgamati is the official remake of Telugu hit, starring Anushka Shetty in the lead. The actor played a female IAS officer who is possessed by the ghost of a dead queen in the film revolving around the theme of revenge. Talking about the film, Bhumi had said earlier, "It is the first time that I am helming a film alone and it is exciting as well as nerve-wrecking. There is a lot of responsibility on me. I have been very fortunate as an artiste and I'm proud of my journey in cinema so far. So, I'm grateful for this opportunity."Durgamati also stars Arshad Warsi.

"The actions we take today will show up in cases two weeks from now," Ferrer told the board, saying she hoped new restrictions cause the number of cases to level out in two to three weeks.
 "We can't really keep waiting to take action," Ferrer said. "It's not like without taking some additional steps we're likely to see ourselves back to a more reasonable case number."
 She warned that an increase in deaths was sure to follow the increase in cases.
 Dr. Christina Ghaly, who runs the county hospital system, reiterated the concern about hospital capacity and clarified that it is not based on the number of actual beds.
 "At this point, unless changes have been made in people's behavior ... to reduce transmission and unless steps continue to be made, then I do anticipate that we will use up those currently available beds," Ghaly said. "The problem ... is not physical beds... The challenge, as it has been throughout the pandemic, is with staffing."
 Hospitals can shift some staff, but have no ability to draw on other regions for medical personnel given the nationwide surge in cases, Ghaly explained.
 Ferrer and Public Health Officer Muntu Davis acknowledged that contact tracing cannot definitively point to outdoor dining as the cause of the surge, but stressed it is the only retail activity that allows customers to be mask-less for long periods of time.
 Supervisor Sheila Kuehl underlined the risk that poses to staff and other customers.
 "It's a bit of magical thinking on everyone's part to think that at any restaurant anywhere that the server keeps a six foot distance from the table," Kuehl said.
 "I sadly, but strongly, support moving our restaurants back to take-out and delivery," Kuehl said.
 Hahn suggested that the county simply crack down on the 20% of restaurants failing to comply with health orders. But Ferrer pointed out that health inspectors can only make weekly visits to about 1% of the 31,000 restaurants countywide.
 The city of Long Beach, which maintains its own health department separate from the county, announced that it will follow in the county's footsteps and also end in-person dining Wednesday night.
 Supervisor Hilda Solis said Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, who lost both his elderly parents to the coronavirus, had texted her to say, "I hope you do the right thing, Hilda."
 Barger said she believed Pasadena, which also has its own health agency, would not close restaurants. Some Pasadena City Council members indicated a desire Monday night to keep restaurants open for in-person dining. City officials said health officials will assess the situation day-by-day, but so far no move has been made to end in-person dining in Pasadena.
 The severity of the surge in COVID-19 cases was made evident later Tuesday, when the county Department of Public Health announced 51 new coronavirus- related deaths. That's the highest daily death total since Sept. 9. Health officials in Long Beach reported another four deaths Monday. The new fatalities increased the countywide death toll to 7,501.
 The county reported another 3,692 confirmed coronavirus cases, while Long Beach added 296 and Pasadena reported 49 more. The overall number of cases in the county stood at 374,479.
 There were 1,575 people hospitalized due to coronavirus as of today, according to health officials. That's up from 888 just two weeks ago.

 During the 1918 pandemic more than 10,000 Minnesotans died, the majority in the October-January time frame.
 We now face even worse in the 2020 pandemic if we cannot change our behaviors. The virus is airborne in tiny particles that can float for hours in homes, churches, restaurants and stores. A few minutes of breathing them can infect you. Follow Dr. Anthony Fauci’s example. Fauci heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci advices residents to go out only when critical, and wear a mask indoors and out.

 Let's all stay home as much as possible, and mask up when we go out. Unfortunately, there are masks of dubious quality online. Consider buying masks from reputable sources such as at BonaFideMasks.com.

Aside from the pandemic and turning to look outside, the birds are fueling up at the feeder as our weather seesaws between above and below average temps.

 People are putting up lights early this year. I sure look forward to the neighbor’s Leg Lamp. It makes you smile no matter the weather.

Buckley and Wright started off fast by meeting in the center of the Octagon and exchanging heavy blows for the majority of round one. With about 20 seconds left in the frame, Buckley hurt Wright with a short right hook that quickly sent Wright into survival mode before he was saved by the bell. Between rounds, Wright was still visibly hurt. Some people remarked afterwards that there was enough evidence to call an end to the bout before the start of the second round. However, the action continued. Buckley, picking up where he left off in round one, came out aggressively at the sound of the bell and landed another vicious right hand on Wright before the ref had seen enough and called an end to the contest. The result was another brutal knockout victory and another performance bonus for Buckley.

We prepared and put the 20-pounder in the oven at 11 a.m. for the next five hours. Since our entire extended family are big Detroit Lions fans, my kids and I watched the traditional Thanksgiving Lions football game as the slowly cooking turkey aroma filled the house.


  Once the Lions game had ended and the Cowboys football game was next, it was time to take the cooked turkey out to make gravy and perform other pre-meal culinary rituals, including making mashed potatoes. Once we took the turkey out, we were stunned. The turkey was sitting in a large swimming pool of juices. To my horror, the two drumsticks, which are my favorite pieces, were both submerged. The elevated turkey breast was the visible island. Some of the stuffing had burst and I swear I saw some of the stuffing pieces swimming laps around the turkey breast island. My kids saw my disappointed look and asked what we would do. I told them either the glass is half full or half empty. We had good, delicious, well-cooked turkey that had done a little swimming or was — let us say — a little soggy. We were going to have a good Thanksgiving meal and a family celebration performing all the rituals.


  My wife’s post-mortem diagnosis was that two hours before the turkey was to be removed from the oven, I should have removed the tin foil tent or dome that covers the turkey while it was roasting. That is what normally both browns the turkey and evaporates some of the excess juices.


  Many families might not travel and let alone get together for Thanksgiving dinner this year because of COVID-19. Some families will miss members who are among the more than 255,000 Americans who have died of the virus.


  Whatever the case might be, make the best of the situation. The glass is half full and count your blessings. Nothing can be worse than the swimming turkey in an oven.


  By the way, after the incident at my first American Thanksgiving dinner many decades ago, I now fiercely guard at the dinner table my large delicious fresh crunchy Caesar salad.

Buckley was given a second chance only three months later when he was tasked with facing undefeated UFC prospect Impa Kasanganay. Kasanganay entered the bout favored and on an eight-fight undefeated streak after a successful UFC debut of his own in August. Yet again, the odds seem stacked against Buckley. The first round primarily consisted of Buckley landing multiple flurries on Kasanganay in addition to a takedown in the latter half of the round, likely resulting in a 10-9 frame for Buckley. About two minutes into the second round, Buckley threw a powerful left kick that Kasanganay caught. Reacting swiftly, Buckley instinctively rotated his hips and threw a spinning right kick as Kasanganay continued to hold onto his leg. The kick landed flush to Kasanganay’s jaw and resulted in one of the most spectacular knockouts in UFC history as Kasanganay was out cold before his head even hit the canvas. The stunning knockout resulted in a performance bonus for Buckley and the first professional loss of Kasanganay’s career. The finish went viral and quickly became the most viewed UFC video in the company’s history, sending Buckley into a new wave of fame and stardom. The Missouri native had rebounded impressively in his sophomore UFC appearance while earning high praise from fans and UFC President Dana White. Many wondered what was next for this middleweight prospect.

The Amory Lady Panthers have a large basketball senior class of seven, and first-year coach Nathan Newell will be relying on their experience as they work towards another winning season.
 “My expectations are going to be high coming from four returning starters, working their way to a new season with a new coach,” Newell said. “It’s kind of different going from them looking to me as the assistant to transitioning to the head coach. I’m pleased with the way they have responded and the way their efforts have been throughout the quarantine type summer that we have had.”
 Amory’s four returning starters that are seniors are Amaya Trimble, Emma Kate Wright, Jatavia Smith and Kimiya Parks.
 “Amaya is going to be our floor general, the leader on the floor, and we need her to control the tempo of the game. I love the effort that Jatavia has been giving in practice, and I love her leadership,” Newell said. “She’s definitely one of our shooters, and hopefully we can get her some easy shots to get her going. Emma Kate is also our shooter, a good ball handler and she’s one of our taller, bigger guards, so I really look at her to use her size to her advantage and strength. Kimiya is very skilled in the post and has played a big role. She can shoot, drive, handle the ball but also score down low, and I look for her to do a lot of rebounding as well.”
 Jillian Cox, Amiya Robinson and Ashlyn Black are all seniors who have seen time coming off the bench in the past.
 “Jillian and Ashlyn are ones who will come in and mix it up inside and hopefully grab some rebounds because we need all the help we can get there,” Newell said. “Amiya is very tenacious on defense, and when I need someone to lock someone down, that’s who I’m going to call. She can score it as well, but we are really looking for her to set the tone on the defensive end.”
 Junior Laney Howell is another strong shooter for the Lady Panthers, while Sasha Burdine and Jayda Sims add to Amory’s guard depth.
 “Laney is probably our best shooter overall, so we will try to draw up some sets and work around her so that we can get her some easy looks,” Newell said. “Sasha is a really good passer and has that basketball IQ so that she knows when to pass it and when not to pass it and when to throw a bounce pass or a chest pass. We will be looking to Jayda to handle the ball, and she can get up and apply some defensive pressure as well. She can get up and down the floor very quick.”
 In the sophomore class, Newell hopes that Ashanti Smith can help in the post.
 “She can also get up and down the floor,” he said. “With the style that we are going to be playing this year, I’m going to be trying to utilize that quickness and speed as much as possible.”
 Between the large senior class and some depth in lower classes, Newell expects that to be a strength of his team.
 “We’re so interchangeable, and we have so many guards that can play any spot. I don’t really think we are going to lose much when we go from our starters to our bench,” he said. “It’s going to be hard for everybody not to get lost in the mix because we have so many girls who can do similar things. I’m just going to have to try my best to prove that I’m playing the ones that are giving me all they’ve got. We will be 9, 10, 11-deep for sure. The good thing if one of them has an off night, then I have someone else who can come in and be right on the same task.”
 That depth will aid Amory in a tough division that includes Belmont, Kossuth, Booneville, Nettleton and Alcorn Central.
 “We have had to rely on our athleticism a lot, and we are still going to rely on that some,” Newell said. “But I’m hoping that we can string together where if it does become a half court game, we can think basketball enough and make some basketball plays where we’re not going to have to solely rely on being bigger and faster and stronger.”

Jeddah (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 25th November, 2020) On the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of All Forms of Violence against Women (25 November), the Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Dr.


  Yousef A. Al-Othaimeen, urged the OIC Member States to continue taking the necessary measures and actions in this regard, especially in light of the global escalation of the phenomenon of domestic violence, as one of the social repercussions of the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19).


  As a result of the necessary precautionary measures taken by countries, including lockdown and home quarantine for long periods, families' income has been adversely affected and the economic situation has deteriorated, a matter that led to increased tension and psychological pressure.   Out of the need to address the growing cases of violence against women, the Secretary General called on Member States to pay attention to enacting laws necessary to protect women and to take the necessary procedural and security measures to eliminate such cases in the societies of the Muslim world because of their negative impact on the development and prosperity of society.


  Al-Othaimeen also stressed that this issue should be among the primary concerns of Member States through intensifying efforts to strengthen national policies and procedures against domestic violence and violence against women, and to strengthen the work of national community institutions working in this field in order to be able to play their role in eliminating cases of violence.

Emotions of losing the season aside, Jamison Gray understands the decision.
 “No matter when it came to an end, it would have been hard – especially with the number of seniors we have in the program,” he said. “I think it helps tremendously knowing that the amazing volleyball community behind our program, conference, and section moved mountains for these girls and they got the opportunity to play for a section title.”
 TIME TO FOCUS, IGNORE THE RUMORS
 Once rumors began circulating about the governor’s announcement last week, coach Gray told his team to shut off their cell phones and ignore social media to help them keep their focus. Before the Osseo match, Gray gathered his team and delivered a message that had a silver lining.
 “We were all expecting that he would tell us the season would be over after that match,” Skylar Gray said. “We were stunned when he told us that we would get to play for two more days in a section tournament. It took a little bit to sink in but all we could think about was how thankful we got to play for two more days.”
 “I thought (coach Gray) was going to give us a big speech about what a great season it has been and how grateful he was to coach us,” Cyr said. “So when he said we have the section tournament tomorrow we were stoked that we got to keep playing. We were so thankful for the opportunity.”
 For Skylar Gray, it was better than not having a season at all.
 “It has been an amazing season and we have been given so many opportunities to do things that we didn’t originally think would happen,” she said. “We are so thankful for the coaches in our conference and section for giving us a couple more days on the court.
 “We have talked a lot about the reality of this season and our coaching staff has always stressed the fact that nothing is a guarantee and that we need to live every rally, practice and match to the fullest. The hardest part about the sudden end of the season is knowing that we are almost out of time with our teammates. Friday was be the end of the high school volleyball journey for our seniors, but it has been one amazing ride.”
