_Yellowstone_ star Cole Hauser is showing off his love of nature. The actor, who portrays Rip Wheeler on the Paramount Network series, was featured in _PEOPLE_ 's "Sexiest Man Alive" issue for 2020, and things got extra steamy when he recreated the _Yellowstone_ bathtub scene, posing for photos in the same water trough Beth Dutton used.
 Shot for the "Change of Scenery" portfolio, the photoshoot took place on "JD's ranch" on the _Yellowstone_ set in Missoula, Montana. Images, which can be viewed on _PEOPLE_ by clicking here, show the actor, 45, posing in the water trough outdoors, Hauser quipping, "minus the champagne or wine that she was drinking." Hauser didn't hesitate for the outdoor dip, explaining that "I did a trip with a few buddies of mine in Costa Rica and we actually never went inside and had a proper shower." He said that bathing outside is something he is "accustomed," adding that "it's refreshing and especially if the water temperature is right, it's just beautiful."
 Hauser's love of nature goes all the way back to his childhood. The actor, who grew up in Santa Barbara and on a ranch in Oregon, told the outlet that his childhood was filled with horseback riding and "cruising around with cows and all kinds of different animals that we had." He recalled how his mother "would ring the dinner bell and the horse that I used to have, Cinnamon, he'd come up and drop his head and I'd just slide down his mane and ride into the house. So I've always been outdoors."
 Now, Hauser spends much of his time in Montana, where the critically acclaimed series _Yellowstone_ films. Hauser said that he spends much of his day "horseback riding at a very high level," which he admitted is "a hell of a workout for core and back and legs." He also does plenty of "roping and cutting." The actor does, however, manage to find calmer moments in the day.

 "My favorite time of day is sunset and sunrise. Especially up here," he said. "I don't know if you can see these mountains behind us, but the sun basically comes right over this and over the Yellowstone ranch. And it goes right behind these mountains here into Trapper Peak. And it's just to die for. I mean, the magic hour here is just stunning."
 When his time on _Yellowstone_ is up and many years in the future when he decides to retire, Hauser said he plans to keep close ties with nature. He told _PEOPLE_ that he hopes to be "sitting on a beach with my wife…we'll have a nice little island somewhere. We're just going to have our feet up, boat kind of out in the ocean, nothing too crazy. Just enjoying the second half of our life."

Boyd and Shilen are coordinators for the SAFER team at the University of Arizona. For 15 years, the Student Aid for Field Epidemiology Response program has trained students to investigate public health crises.
 Team members used to track local outbreaks of foodborne illnesses and monitor flu cases. Now they’re tackling a pandemic that has killed 1.5 million people across the globe.
 “In the beginning, it was like 10 cases … and then it was 100, and then it was 200. And then you really started to feel the growing pains,” said Erika Austhof, an UA epidemiologist who leads SAFER’s call center.
 Case investigations and contact tracing are key to fighting COVID-19. Investigations involve calling individuals who have tested positive to gather information about their illness, travel history and recent close contacts. Contact tracing is when exposed individuals are alerted and given guidance about how to get tested and potential self-isolation.
 SAFER does both, and it’s just one of a slew of groups nationwide helping underfunded public health agencies with what has become a colossal effort. Since January, more than 14 million people in the U.S. have been infected.
 Kristen Pogreba-Brown, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Arizona who leads SAFER, said volunteers who stepped up in the early days of the pandemic were vital in getting the work off the ground.
 “We were just kind of running around with our hair on fire … and just having people say, ‘Tell me what you need help with,’ ‘We can help make phone calls,’ ‘I can help do this’ – that was extremely important in the very beginning,” Pogreba-Brown said.
 In April, researchers at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimated that at least 100,000 new contact tracers would be needed in the U.S. to meet the demand caused by rising COVID-19 cases. But funding that many contact tracers would take billions of dollars.
 Using funding provided through the CARES Act, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded more than $600 million to 64 jurisdictions, including Arizona, to help with testing, contact tracing and containment.
 According to a survey conducted by Johns Hopkins and NPR, the United States had more than 50,000 contact tracers in October, the most since the pandemic was declared in March.
 A measure pending in Congress calls for the creation of a National Public Health Corps, similar to AmeriCorps, that would leverage existing national service structures to deploy volunteers to communities to help fight COVID-19 by doing contact tracing and other work.
 President-elect Joe Biden supports the idea. His transition plan calls for the hiring of at least 100,000 people to perform contact tracing, among other functions.
 A spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of Health Services said the agency has cross-trained about 600 people, both agency employees and employees of contractors, in case investigation and contact tracing. County public health departments employ staff for the same purposes.
 Those investigators work in tandem with programs such as SAFER, with an aim to find and contact everyone who is infected or has been exposed to the coronavirus.
 SAFER employs 46 people and has a team of more than 300 volunteers, all of whom are affiliated with the University of Arizona and the majority of whom are students. Faculty and staff at the university volunteer as well.
 “We call ourselves a mini health department because we’re so large,” Boyd said.
 The SAFER team launched its COVID-related efforts at the end of March. From April through September, volunteers put in almost 2,000 hours of unpaid time. The team has made about 9,000 case investigation calls and contacted over 1,000 people exposed to the virus.
 The team performs case investigations in Pima, Pinal, Yuma and Maricopa counties, as well as contact tracing when anyone connected to the university is exposed to COVID-19.

There's no doubt that the Q2 Monochrom is extremely expensive for a compact camera, albeit one with a 47.3MP full-frame sensor. And even by Leica standards, it's monochrome-only sensor makes it extremely niche. But it does give photographers who'd like to own a Leica camera a much more affordable option than an M10 or M10 Monochrom – and if you don't mind only shooting exclusively in black and white, and it produces stunning image quality, too.

United kept the pressure on with their shape fluid – and when they did get the ball in the net, from a close-range Hall header, it was ruled out because of a debatable foul on the goalkeeper. Hall shot inches wide with another chance from outside of the area on 36 minutes. A low Whitfield shot from the left was straight at Ashby-Hammond.
 Lemonheigh-Evans had a shot saved before MacDonald handled the ball a couple of times at the other end when Maidenhead had a couple of tame attacks.
 Torquay went in at half time 1-0 ahead, however, when Hall volleyed the ball back forward from a clearance and Whitfield ran onto it and brilliantly lobbed the onrushing goalkeeper.
 The second half began with Ashby-Hammond making a good double save from Lemonheigh-Evans and Wright on the rebound to deny the Gulls a quick second goal.
 Maidenhead’s first shot on goal came in the 49th minute – but the ball flew high over.
