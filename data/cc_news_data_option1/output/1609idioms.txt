The news out of the governor’s office on Wednesday – an executive order extending distance learning for the rest of the school year – came as no surprise to Mark Westpfahl and his students at Capitol Hill Magnet School in St. Paul. They’ve dealt with these less-than-ideal circumstances since March. At the same time, the official decision to shut down physical learning inside school buildings came as a somewhat of a gut punch. Teachers must now prepare for several more weeks of e-learning, which can be a great fall-back thanks to modern technology but can’t fully replace a classroom setting. Westpfahl is looking forward to a three-day period in early May – outlined specifically in the executive order – that will allow staff to plan for the remainder of the school year. In a news conference on Thursday, Gov. Walz – a former teacher and coach himself – empathized with both teachers and students, particularly the Class of 2020 that will miss graduation ceremonies, proms and spring activities. He also noted that the circumstances of distance learning can have an adverse effect on some families, which is why his executive order directed schools to “support communities disproportionately impacted” by e-learning.
