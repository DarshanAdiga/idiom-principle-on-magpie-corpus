Gov. Laura Kelly announced Monday she would again nominate longtime state and federal public defender Carl Folsom III for a seat on the Kansas Court of Appeals, despite the Senate rejecting him for a separate vacancy earlier this year.


   


  At a Statehouse news conference, Kelly praised Folsom's work as a public defender, saying that he rose above the other finalists put forth by the Court of Appeals Nominating Commission and was "without a doubt the most qualified person for the job."


   


  The move comes following the retirement of Judge Steve Leben in February to accept a teaching position at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law.


   


  "Carl proved during the interview process that he knows the struggle of Kansans who face economic insecurity," Kelly said. "He knows the challenges in our criminal justice system and as a public defender he was willing to go the extra mile to protect Kansans fundamental right to an attorney."


   


  Folsom had been previously nominated for a separate seat on the bench but fell three votes shy of being approved by the Senate during that body's special session in June.


   


  Some members cited Folsom's credentials as too narrow for the position. Others said his political beliefs would affect his partiality as a jurist.


   


  Seven Republicans joined Democrats in supporting Folsom's nomination, which passed on an 18-17 vote but fell three votes short of the 21-vote threshold to confirm.


   


  "I do believe we are maybe unfairly characterizing his experience as a public defender," said Sen. Jeff Longbine, R-Emporia. "If we do not recognize the value of public defenders in our justice system then I think we have no justice system."


   


  Kelly said that some members had privately told her they "regret" the way they voted and that Folsom's chances the second time around would be better.


   


  "I fully expect that the Senate will come back and do the right thing this time," she said.


   


  But Sen. Molly Baumgardner, R-Louisburg, a chief critic of Folsom's record, said that wasn't the case.


   


  "No means no and the vote of the Senate speaks for itself," she said in a phone interview.


   


  The governor was strident in her criticism of the Senate's actions, calling them "political games." Her ire was matched by the Kansas Bar Association, which said the vote came in "stark contrast" to the ideal of an independent judiciary.


   


  Folsom's work as a federal public defender in Oklahoma and Kansas in particular drew pushback from senators, including his work on behalf of a client seeking to appeal his child pornography conviction.


   


  In addition to his current federal work, Folsom worked for the Kansas Appellate Defender's Office and also presently serves as an adjunct professor at the University of Kansas School of Law.


   


  If Folsom is again rejected, the Court of Appeals Nominating Commission, which screens potential judicial nominees, will pick another candidate to be considered alongside the previous two finalists.


   


  All Kansas counties now reporting COVID-19 cases


   


  The state saw 1,545 new cases of COVID-19 since Friday, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment said Monday, in addition to seven new deaths attributed to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.


   


  Monday also brought the revelation that the two remaining counties in the state that hadn't yet announced cases -- Rawlins and Wallace counties -- were now reporting infections.


   


  The news wasn't welcome, Kelly said, especially with students in the state returning to school in the coming weeks.


   


  "It was a bad weekend," she said.


   


  The results include six clusters of cases at colleges and universities in the state, including over 80 students who tested positive at the University of Kansas. One college student in the state had been hospitalized with multi- system inflammatory syndrome, a rare condition that causes inflammation in vital organs.


   


  "As more schools begin to open we must be more diligent," Kelly said of mitigation tactics.

LAHORE, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 25th Aug, 2020 ) :The Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) has taken multiple steps during last two years to provide state of the art facilities to the visitors besides improving the condition of all public parks.
 PHA Director General Jawad Ahmed Qureshi said on Tuesday that PHA had planted around 2.3 million trees, saplings and plants in the provincial capital during last two years, adding that PHA was working on multiple projects to extend green belts, maintain the parks of the city and maintain playgrounds. He said that Authority was working on all the domains to make the city a center of recreation for its citizens and a pride for the country.
 He said that PHA had planted city's first urban forest inspired by miyawaki method in Shadman Market Park in which around 9,000 various types of plants and saplings were planted. He said that with this Japanese technique plant growth was 10 time faster than the normal plant and it would grow into trees in coming few months.
 He asserted that around 51 urban forest (Miyawaki) would be planted in the city to tackle environment challenges.
 While giving some details regarding last two years performance of the department, he said all the major parks of the provincial capital including Jillani Parks (Race Course Park), Bagh-e-Jinnah, Greater Iqbal Parks, Jallo Botanical Garden and Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park were equipped with latest recreational facilities for the families and visitors.

The Met Office has never had two named storms in August since the process started in 2015, but Francis comes on the back of Ellen which struck last week and caused power outages.


  Ellen also saw 15-year-old Nicola Williams swept to her death in the Rhymney River in Llanrumney, Cardiff, and a 50-year-old holidaymaker die in the sea near Helston, west Cornwall, after getting into difficulties.


  Alex Deakin from the Met Office said it will be “wet and windy for large chunks of the UK”.


  He added: “The bands of rain (will) move into Northern Ireland and stick around, move into Scotland and hang around for most of the day.”


  Forecasters said the winds were “unusual” for August, but would have to go some way to beat the current record wind gust speed of 87mph recorded at The Needles on the Isle of Wight in August 1996.

A veritable flood of thoughts ran through Justin Hughes' mind earlier this month when, for the first time in over a year, he stepped back on a football field as a serious participant.


   


  "A bunch of emotions," said Hughes, Kansas State's middle linebacker, who missed last season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. "Sadness that I missed last year. I just thought about it all the time that I missed last year.


   


  "Happiness, just being out there with my teammates laughing and playing ball again. Excited."


   


  And that wasn't all. Though Hughes, now a sixth-year senior, was granted a medical redshirt by the NCAA, a cloud of uncertainty remained.


   


  The ongoing coronavirus pandemic already wiped out spring practice, and when preseason camp started, there was no guarantee there would be a fall season, either.


   


  "It's a little difficult, but I'm a man of faith and I'm a man of God, and I know that God has a plan for me and my teammates," Hughes said during an Aug. 11 virtual press conference, one day before learning that the Big 12 would indeed play a 10-game schedule this fall. "I just handle (one) day at a time, take it one step at a time."


   


  Then there were the natural concerns about the injury itself.


   


  "Am I going to go out here and tank it and get hurt again?" Hughes said. "Those are emotions I always go through, but my trainers have done a good job helping me mentally as far as going out there and just being able to play.


   


  "Just go out there and do your very best and forget (that) you were ever hurt. Just go out there and play like you're normal, because your knee is fixed and everything is healed."


   


  Before he got hurt toward the end of spring practice in 2019, then first-year head coach Chris Klieman raved about Hughes, not only for his play on the field but also his leadership qualities and his grasp of a new defense.


   


  A rash of injuries at linebacker in 2018 had opened the door for Hughes, who started the last seven games and finished third on the team in tackles with 56, including seven for loss, with two forced fumbles.


   


  Steve Stanard, who took over as linebacker coach when defensive coordinator Scottie Hazelton left for Michigan State during the offseason, said the biggest challenge for Hughes so far is regaining his form on the field.


   


  "Justin is very communicative; he understands everything," Stanard said. "As he continues to come back from that knee, the issue for him is probably going to be the movement skills.


   


  "And as long as he understands his angles and puts himself in the right body position, Justin can be an effective player."


   


  Hughes rated his recovery at 96% after a week of practice.


   


  "Just trying to come back from my injury (and) getting healthy again, getting stronger by the day," he said. "It's just starting to feel more normal.


   


  "I know everything is out of whack right now with whether we're going to play or whether we're not going to play, but I can't focus on that. We just have to focus on getting better as a team and individually so we can help the team become better as a unit."


   


  While Hughes continues to improve with each practice, it's an ongoing process.


   


  "I think he's still probably dusting off some rust," Stanard said. "It's been a little while since he played some football. The last time he tackled someone was over a year ago.


   


  "He'll get there. But his mental part is what separates Justin -- understanding where he's supposed to be in the communication part of it with the rest of the defense."


   


  So as the Wildcats continue preparations for their Aug. 12 season opener against Arkansas State at Bill Snyder Family Stadium, it's all about repetitions for Hughes.


   


  "We've been through the training process, and we've been through the treatment process, rehab and everything," Hughes said. "We've done everything possible for me to go out there and be successful, so I just have to go out there and play."
