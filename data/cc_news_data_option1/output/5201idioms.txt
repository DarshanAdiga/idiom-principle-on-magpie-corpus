I am really excited for this weekend’s super middle weight showdown. No one can pick holes in Canelo for seeking out this fight. He is taking on "the man" in the super middle weight division who is naturally far bigger than him and in or very close to his peak. If he wins as most expect he will there is nothing to give him but credit.

Ethiopia on Friday offered a reward in exchange for information that could help locate leaders of the Tigray region's ruling party, who have been the target of a major military offensive.
 Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, last year's Nobel Peace Prize winner, announced the military campaign against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) on November 4, saying it came in response to TPLF-orchestrated attacks on federal army camps.
 Abiy declared victory after federal forces took the regional capital Mekele in late November, but the UN says clashes persist in the region and TPLF leaders remain on the run.
 The military will pay 10 million Ethiopian birr (roughly $250,000 / 205,000 euros) to "any person who knows the exact location of the TPLF junta leadership", the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation quoted Lieutenant General Asrat Denero, head of the military's community information department, as saying Friday.
 Asrat also provided a hotline where citizens could give tips.
 Two days after Mekele fell, Abiy told lawmakers that federal forces were monitoring TPLF leaders closely from "the situation room" and would apprehend them soon.
 He said TPLF leaders had fled west of the city, though Debretsion Gebremichael, president of Tigray when the conflict started, told AFP at the time that Abiy had the location wrong.
 Debretsion and other TPLF leaders have been unreachable for nearly two weeks.
 On November 13 federal police announced arrest warrants for Debretsion and 63 other TPLF leaders.
 It was not immediately clear Friday if the reward offer applied to all of them.
 The fighting in Tigray has left thousands dead, according to the International Crisis Group (ICG) think tank, and sent tens of thousands of refugees streaming across the border into Sudan.
 The UN has been lobbying -- so far unsuccessfully -- for unfettered access to the region to provide humanitarian assistance.
 On Thursday it announced a $35.6 million emergency aid package for civilians caught up in the conflict.

“I feel honored, and it’s taken a lot from the coaching staff, my teammates and my family and I’ve put a lot of work in,” Biser said. “As a whole, as a team, we came to make each other better and that’s what helped me get this accomplishment.”
 Adversity struck early for the Mohigans. Implementing a new offensive system, losing rising-star quarterback Gunner Lattimore and a spike in COVID-19 cases forcing Monongalia County to go dark for the first four weeks of the football season put the team in a tough spot. Opening up its season against two of the best teams in the state didn’t help, but Biser was there to lead his team — albeit silently and by example –— to awaken in Game 3 against Parkersburg South. The Mohigans (3-3) moved on finish the season 2-1 – defeating Linsly and rival University, and losing to Bridgeport – and establish Sean’s Wing-T offense. Through all of this, Biser’s mental toughness was at the forefront.
 “My dad has coached us and told us, ‘Control what you can control,’ “ Biser said. “There’s adversity in life and you have to keep driving and keep that engine going. You’re going to face troubles and you have to keep moving.”
 He also had to be physically ready to go whenever the metrics allowed Mon County teams to play again. Luckily, his dad, coaches and teammates were there to help guide him through that as well. Still, it came down to Biser whether he would let the adversity get the better of him. Instead of giving into it like some athletes, Biser rose above and, in turn, pushed his teammates to do the same.

The singer's cryptic posts came after he was spotted sporting platinum blonde hair while out and about in New York on Tuesday. It was his first public outing since he and Gigi Hadid welcomed their daughter in September. He was hard to miss as he dressed in a bright yellow quilted jacket paired with yellow sneakers.
 The 27-year-old "Icarus Falls" hitmaker could be teasing a live show if his past tweet about getting back on stage is anything to go by. He tweeted in January 2019 that he cannot wait to perform for his fans as he has "got tunes that bang for days." He wrote that he is "feelin ready."
 The public is privy to the fact that Malik has not toured his music because he has suffered from anxiety and stage fright since he left One Direction in 2015. Perhaps he wants to start fresh in 2021 and conquer his fears for the sake of the fans who have since been wanting to see him perform live.

In a recent interview with People magazine, the actor shared that the fans of the "upside-down" will "get to see an entirely other colour of him that has been hinted at."
 "One of the great things that you can see with Hopper is that he was a protector, he's a man of justice [and] he now has become a prisoner. He's trapped and he's isolated," Harbour said.

US President-elect Joe Biden has announced his climate and energy team, which the transition said is ready on day one to advance his agenda and lead the world to confront the undeniable, accelerating and punishing reality of climate change. The nominees are Congresswoman Deb Haaland as Secretary of Interior, Jennifer Granholm as Energy Secretary, Michael Regan as administrator for Environmental Protection Agency and Brenda Mallory as Chair of the Council of the Council on Environmental Quality.
 Biden on Thursday also announced the appointment of Gina McCarthy as his National Climate Advisor and Ali Zaidi as his Deputy National Climate Advisor. Zaidi is the highest-ranking Pakistani-American appointed by Biden in his administration. "This brilliant, tested, trailblazing team will be ready on day one to confront the existential threat of climate change with a unified national response rooted in science and equity. They share my belief that we have no time to waste to confront the climate crisis, protect our air and drinking water, and deliver justice to communities that have long shouldered the burdens of environmental harms, Biden said in a statement.
 Together, on behalf of all Americans, they will meet this moment with the urgency it demands and seize the opportunity to build back better with good- paying union jobs, climate-resilient infrastructure and a clean energy future that benefits every single community, he said. Biden is scheduled to be inaugurated as the 46th US President on January 20. He has vowed to rejoin the Paris climate deal on the first day of his presidency.
 The Trump administration last month formally withdrew from the Paris accord, a decision originally announced three years ago. The deal committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C above pre- industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. Trump argues that the agreement is disadvantageous for the US, while it gives benefits to countries like China, Russia and India. According to him, it could be economically detrimental and cost 2.5 million Americans their jobs by 2025.
 Observing that the undeniable, accelerating, punishing reality of climate change is exacting an incalculable toll on lives and livelihoods in every community across the country, the transition said the team knows that science demands they address climate change immediately and that the response must be grounded in science. The team will turn the climate crisis into an unprecedented opportunity to create millions of good-paying union jobs in communities across the country; powering the economy with clean energy and positioning the US as an exporter of 21st-century products, and making the economy stronger and more resilient.
 They will work closely with communities who bear the outsized burden of environmental injustice, including Tribal Nations and communities of colour, and young Americans who will live with the long-term consequences of climate change, the transition said. Haaland is currently serving as Vice-Chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources. If confirmed, she will make history as the first-ever Native American Cabinet secretary.
 Granholm is a two-term Governor of Michigan whose work during and after her tenure has centred on creating clean energy jobs in America. Her leadership was instrumental in rescuing the US auto industry, saving one million jobs, and preparing Detroit for a clean energy future. Nominated to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Regan is the current Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. He has served in the EPA under both Democratic and Republican presidents and has a distinguished track record of bringing people together across the public, private and non-profit sectors to advance environmental justice and seek solutions to environmental and climate challenges.
 An accomplished public servant and environmental lawyer, Mallory is former General Counsel to the Council on Environmental Quality and current Director of Regulatory Policy at the Southern Environmental Law Centre. If confirmed, she would be the first African American to hold the position since its creation more than half a century ago. McCarthy will serve as the first-ever National Climate Advisor, heading up the newly formed White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, where she will drive an all of the government approach to combating climate change.
 A leading voice on climate and environmental issues for more than 30 years, McCarthy was a driving force behind the Obama-Biden administration's groundbreaking Clean Power Plan during her tenure as EPA Administrator. Zaidi, a leading climate expert and longtime advisor to the president-elect, will serve as Deputy National Climate Advisor. He had helped draft and implement the Obama-Biden Administration's Climate Action Plan and negotiate the Paris accord. Zaidi immigrated from Pakistan and grew up in the Rust Belt outside Erie, Pennsylvania.
 …our climate crisis is a grave and growing threat to the American people and the planet…President-elect Biden and I proposed one of the most ambitious climate plans in history. The team we are announcing today will help make that plan a reality, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said. They are the team the American people need and deserve to help protect our communities and our planet for generations, she said.

“[It was] just the want to [be physically ready], wanting to win, to have as high a standard as possible,” he said. “I just wanted it that bad. Every day in practice, we tried to push ourselves to get better and get ready for Friday night.”
 To instill that mindset, Biser had to lead in some capacity – he was the only player on the team that knew his dad’s playbook in and out – but he’s not the stereotypical “coach’s son” you see in some programs. So how exactly did he do it? According to him, he knew his teammates “had it in them” to learn the book, so he took a mostly hands-off approach, rallying the team around a positive work ethic despite any and all adversity.
 “They are athletes by heart,” Biser said. “They knew what it took. Those first two games gave us a realization that we’ve got this, so we came together as a team and that’s what clicked [for the rest of the season].”
 Now, looking at playing in college, Biser has some time to decide what’s next. From playing for the Golden Tornado and establishing himself as a defensive threat, to finishing out his high school career with a brand new team, in a brand new town, during a downright crazy year, Biser has the chance to stay in Morgantown for four more years, garnering a preferred walk-on offer from WVU. Yet, it hasn’t been a cakewalk, he’s had to earn his spot on both sides of the ball, whether talking handoffs on offense or eating up running backs and quarterbacks at middle and outside linebacker.
 At the end of the day, with the chance to take the Biser name back to the Old Gold and Blue, he couldn’t be happier with his young career.
 “[My game] has developed really well. The experience helped in getting the technique down, just that muscle memory over the years, has made me into the player I am today,” he said.
 “It’s an honor [to be offered from WVU]. You know, just following your dad and filling those shoes from years ago, it’s really cool and an honor to get that opportunity.”

Vanessa Bryant has dubbed her mother Sofia Laine's lawsuit against her "absurd" and an attempt to "extort a financial windfall" from her family after her husband Kobe Bryant's untimely death.
 Sofia Laine filed a suit against her daughter Vanessa Bryant on Tuesday, seeking financial support on the grounds that she worked unpaid as a "longtime personal assistant and nanny" for the family for years. According to court documents obtained by People magazine, Laine has claimed that the late Kobe Bryant had "promised to take care of" his mother-in-law "for the rest of her life."
 "Unfortunately, Kobe Bryant's promises did not see the light of day as he is now deceased, and Vanessa Bryant took each and every step she could to void and cancel all of Kobe Bryant's promises made to [Laine]. Vanessa Bryant did not intend to honour any of the Bryants' representations, agreements and promises at any stage," it has been alleged in the court papers filed by the 68-year-old.

The European Union's chief negotiator said Friday that the bloc and the United Kingdom are starting a "last attempt" to clinch a post-Brexit trade deal, with EU fishing rights in British waters the most notable remaining obstacle to avoid a chaotic and costly changeover on New Year.Michel Barnier told the EU parliament he "can't say what will come out during this home straight of the negotiations," which have already come a long way in nine months of talks. He called it "a very serious and somber situation" with the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people at stake.The EU parliament has set a Sunday night deadline on the talks since it still will have to approve any deal ahead of year-end, when a transition period following the Jan. 31 departure of Britain from the bloc will expire."It's the moment of truth," said Barnier. "We have very little time remaining -- just a few hours."A failure to reach a post-Brexit deal would lead to more chaos on the borders at the start of 2021 as new tariffs would add to other impediments to trade that are enacted by both sides. The talks have got bogged down on two main issues over the past days -- the EU's access to U.K. fishing waters and assurances of fair competition between businesses."We have reached the hard nuts to crack," said Barnier.He said the EU understood and respected the U.K. desire to rule its own waves, but said that "a credible period of adjustment" had to be given, if EU boats are to be kicked out of British waters despite centuries of tradition of sharing them.On top of that, the more London denies access to its waters, the more the EU can impose duties and tariffs."The European Union also has to maintain its sovereign right to react or to compensate," Barnier said, highlighting that the U.K. seafood industry is extremely dependent on exports to the 27-nation bloc. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made fisheries and U.K. control over its waters a key demand in the long saga of Britain's departure from the EU.The European Parliament issued a three-day ultimatum to negotiators to strike a trade deal if it's to be in a position to ratify an agreement this year. European lawmakers said they will need to have the terms of any deal in front of them by late Sunday if they are to organize a special gathering before the end of the year.If a deal comes later, it could only be ratified in 2021, as the parliament wouldn't have enough time to debate the agreement before that.A trade deal would ensure there are no tariffs and quotas on trade in goods between the two sides, but there would still be technical costs, partly associated with customs checks and non-tariff barriers on services.Britain's Parliament must also approve any Brexit deal, and the Christmas break adds to the timing complications. Lawmakers are due to be on vacation from Friday until Jan. 5, but the government has said they can be called back on 48 hours' notice to approve an agreement if one is struck.Though both sides would suffer economically from a failure to secure a trade deal, most economists think the British economy would take a greater hit, at least in the near-term, as it is relatively more reliant on trade with the EU than vice versa.Both sides have said they would try to mitigate the impact of a no-deal, but most experts think that whatever short-term measures are put in place, the disruptions to trade will be immense.

 Michel Barnier told the EU parliament he "can't say what will come out during this home straight of the negotiations," which have already come a long way in nine months of talks. He called it "a very serious and somber situation" with the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people at stake.
 The EU parliament has set a Sunday night deadline on the talks since it still will have to approve any deal ahead of year-end, when a transition period following the Jan. 31 departure of Britain from the bloc will expire.
 "It's the moment of truth," said Barnier. "We have very little time remaining -- just a few hours."
 A failure to reach a post-Brexit deal would lead to more chaos on the borders at the start of 2021 as new tariffs would add to other impediments to trade that are enacted by both sides. The talks have got bogged down on two main issues over the past days -- the EU's access to U.K. fishing waters and assurances of fair competition between businesses.
 "We have reached the hard nuts to crack," said Barnier.
 He said the EU understood and respected the U.K. desire to rule its own waves, but said that "a credible period of adjustment" had to be given, if EU boats are to be kicked out of British waters despite centuries of tradition of sharing them.
 On top of that, the more London denies access to its waters, the more the EU can impose duties and tariffs.
 "The European Union also has to maintain its sovereign right to react or to compensate," Barnier said, highlighting that the U.K. seafood industry is extremely dependent on exports to the 27-nation bloc. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made fisheries and U.K. control over its waters a key demand in the long saga of Britain's departure from the EU.
 The European Parliament issued a three-day ultimatum to negotiators to strike a trade deal if it's to be in a position to ratify an agreement this year. European lawmakers said they will need to have the terms of any deal in front of them by late Sunday if they are to organize a special gathering before the end of the year.
 If a deal comes later, it could only be ratified in 2021, as the parliament wouldn't have enough time to debate the agreement before that.
 A trade deal would ensure there are no tariffs and quotas on trade in goods between the two sides, but there would still be technical costs, partly associated with customs checks and non-tariff barriers on services.
 Britain's Parliament must also approve any Brexit deal, and the Christmas break adds to the timing complications. Lawmakers are due to be on vacation from Friday until Jan. 5, but the government has said they can be called back on 48 hours' notice to approve an agreement if one is struck.
 Though both sides would suffer economically from a failure to secure a trade deal, most economists think the British economy would take a greater hit, at least in the near-term, as it is relatively more reliant on trade with the EU than vice versa.
 Both sides have said they would try to mitigate the impact of a no-deal, but most experts think that whatever short-term measures are put in place, the disruptions to trade will be immense.

As with many other health conditions, prevention is usually the best treatment for dandruff. So, if you're prone to the itchy scalp and telltale flakes of dandruff, learn how to keep them at bay with a few simple preventive measures. In no time, your luxurious locks and trendy threads will once again steal the show. Apple cider vinegar is also often used as a natural remedy to get rid of dandruff.

 The group eventually came to the conclusion that things should be left just the way they are, but it started a discussion and the law of inheritance was eventually changed four years later to allow first-born children to take the throne regardless of their gender. In changing its succession laws, the country was still 23 years ahead of the United Kingdom which introduced absolute primogeniture only before the birth of Prince George in 2013.
 "For me, I was like, 'Phew.' It is a lot of pressure, and it really is a life that you need to choose and be committed to 100%. So I'm very happy that my brother is next in line, and he's doing an amazing job. He's focused on all the right things," Princess Märtha Louise said about her decision. The mother- of-three also denounced her HRH title in 2002 and has been working as a private citizen since then.
 Norway is all set to see its first female monarch in the future, as Crown Prince Haakon's first-born is Princess Ingrid Alexandra, whom he shares with his wife Mette-Marit. However, Märtha notes that they have still a long way to go for equal rights for women, revealing that even her mother Queen Sonja had to face struggles within the royal household.
 "I've seen my mom struggle, because when she came into the palace they had to wait nine years to get married because she wasn't aristocracy or from any royal background," she said.
 The princess notes that the palace was "a military driven organization where the women had been gone for many years" back when her mother married into the family, and so she wasn't even allowed to have her own office and staff.
 "She wasn't even accepted in the building," Märtha added about Queen Sonja who was made Queen consort of Norway after Harald V became King in 1991. The princess shares that at least 50% of palace staff are now women "thanks to my mother."

A Google executive said on Friday that a proposed Australian law to make digital platforms pay for news was unworkable and its proposed arbitration model was biased toward media businesses.
 Google Australia and New Zealand Managing Director Mel Silva made her first public comments on the details of the proposed legislation since it was introduced to Parliament last week.
 The so-called News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code would force Google and Facebook to compensate Australian news media for the journalism that they link to.
 "It forces Google to pay to show links in an unprecedented intervention that would fundamentally break how search engines work," Silva said in a statement.
 If a platform and a news business couldn't agree on a price for news after three months of negotiations, a three-member arbitration panel would be appointed to make a binding decision for payment.
 Silva said "binding arbitration within the code could be a reasonable backstop -- so long as the arbitration model is fair."
 However, the proposed arbitration model was "skewed to the interests of one type of business only," Silva said, referring to media.
 Google said it had provided a better model with Google News Showcase. Google is paying participating publishers to provide paywalled content to News Showcase users through the model that it launched in October.
 "By imposing final-offer arbitration with biased criteria, it encourages publishers to go to arbitration rather than reaching an agreement," Silva said of the government's model.
 Swinburne University media lecturer Belinda Barnet said Google was pushing its own model because it wanted more power in negotiations than media businesses.
 "It's a cynical ploy by Google," Barnet said. "They tried the misinformation campaign, that didn't work, and now they're saying: 'We can do it better. We're already doing it better.'"
 News Showcase "benefits the major players," while the Australian government wanted payment for news to be "fair and across the board," Barnet said.
 Details of the draft legislation will be scrutinized by a Senate committee before lawmakers vote on it next year.
 Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who introduced the legislation to Parliament, said in a statement that Google could make a submission to that committee before it releases its finding in February.
 Breaches of the code, such as failure to negotiate in good faith, would be punishable by a fine of 10 million Australian dollars ($7.4 million) or the equivalent of 10% of annual turnover in Australia.

Billed as eastern India's first 'Glamping' festival or glamorous camping, the Marine Drive-Eco Retreat spread out on a kilometre-long stretch of Ramchandi Beach near Sun temple at Konark went on for almost 2 months between December 2019 and February 2020.
 The Eco-retreat camp, advertised as an attraction for high-end tourists, offered double occupancy tents priced between Rs 6,000 to Rs 22,000 per night that covered for private dining area, spa as well as non-alcoholic minibar facilities apart from several other water sports activities.
 Closely modelled on the annual Rann Utsav held at Rann of Kutch, where the Gujarat government organises tented accommodation for tourists, the Marine Drive-Eco Retreat plans to showcase the best of Odisha's food and culture for high-end tourists.
 However, an RTI application filed into the expenditure incurred on last year's eco-retreat festival has revealed that the government has not made any profit on its maiden eco-retreat venture. RTI activist Pradip Pradhan, who had filed an application seeking details of the expenditure on the first-ever eco- retreat camp, was told by the tourism department that the government spent at least Rs 4.5 crore on paying the event management company Lallooji & Sons while it got Rs 3.8 crore as revenue.
 The tourism department however, was silent on the total amount of money spent on the festival, though an amount of Rs 12.13 crore was sanctioned for the purpose. The RTI activist alleged that the government's loss from the festival is likely to be higher and that's why the tourism department did not specify how much more was spent apart from the money paid to the event management company.
 Though the tourism department did not make any profit from last year's eco retreat camp at Konark, similar camps are being held at 4 more places including at Konark, Satkosia, Bhitarkanika, Daringbadi and Hirakud this month.
 Director of Odisha tourism department, Sachin Ramchandra Jadhav, said not much should be read into the losses incurred by the government in holding such events. "While hotels in Puri last year did not see much occupancy, we saw more than 70% occupancy. These events are essentially promoting the state's tourism potential. It would take 7-8 years to break even and make money. Even in Gujarat, where the Rann of Kutch festival started, they did not make money for 7-8 years. After seeing our success, even Jharkhand has decided to hold similar eco-retreat camps," said Jadhav.

 Jadhav said the criticism that the government was spending money 'unnecessarily' in such festivals was a bit unwarranted as it was the responsibility of the government to promote the state's tourism potential.
 "How many tourists would come to places like Daringbadi and Satkosia and spend Rs 9,000 a day if such events are not organised? High-end tourists who visit such places would help the local economy as they would hire vehicles from local travel operators. Through such programmes, the interiors of Odisha are being promoted," he said.
 JK Mohanty, president of hotel and restaurant association of Odisha said it is important to make a noise in the tourism circuit and the government is taking the right step. "The pandemic has affected the tourism industry adversely. Through such events, the tourism and travel industry in Odisha would get a leg up," said Mohanty.
 In 2019-20, 15.5 lakh domestic tourists and a little more than 1 lakh foreigners had visited Odisha.

After several years in business Burgett bought McCoy out.
 The store is known for selling inexpensive groceries, mostly obtained from other businesses, for example buying out the stock of bankrupt stores, bidding on incomplete pallets from warehouses, salvaging recovered product from truck roll-offs and purchasing food from restaurants going out of business.
 The groceries and other items are picked up in truckloads and unloaded at the store, usually in the early morning.
 Doyle, who has developed eye problems, can’t drive anymore and pick up loads, but he still has a hand in the running of the business.
 Irene Renfro, the Burgetts’ adopted daughter, took over some of the driving responsibilities and helped run the store.
 Joan Burgett, Doyle’s wife, said they bought cheap to sell cheap to the public.
 She said many families have a history of coming in once a month and stocking up on pick-up truck loads of groceries.
 The Burgetts have had setbacks over the years.
 In 1982 the store burned down and was rebuilt.
 About seven years ago their home next door to the store burned down and they had to move to Howard because they couldn’t afford to rebuild their home in Salida.
 When the Decker fire took hold in fall 2019, they had to close down for a month and the Burgetts were evacuated along with 24 peacocks.
 The store was starting to come back from being closed for that month when COVID-19 hit in March.
 Joan said COVID-19 changed the way people shop, many preferring to order online or have items delivered to their home.
 Things came to a halt, she said.
 Although, she said, with a laugh, Burmac had toilet paper in the spring when other local stores didn’t.
 COVID-19 didn’t stop the Burgetts from taking care of their neighbors, however.
 In May they set up a “Burmac Brown Bag Special” pick up in Howard, where customers from Chaffee and Fremont counties could come and get a box of staples for $20 which included five pounds each of sugar, pinto beans, flour and potatoes, three pounds of onions, a pound of butter, salt, two rolls of toilet paper, napkins and ketchup.
 At the time Joan said, “We’re not getting rich, that’s for sure. We never got rich doing this store. It was always to help the underdog to sell cheap groceries at cheap prices and pass the good deals onto the consumer.”
 As the many licenses needed to keep the store open come up for renewal in January, the Burgetts decided it was time to wind things up at Burmac.
 Customers who have become friends through the years have been helping the Burgetts clean up and get ready to close.
 Today at 5 p.m. the store will shut its doors for the last time. Whatever is left over will be donated to food pantries in Cañon City and Salida.
 Joan said she didn’t know what they were going to do with the building.
 The timing is deliberate, however. Saturday is the Burgetts’ wedding anniversary and Christmas Day is Joan’s birthday.
 The couple plan to spend both relaxing, not working for a change and beginning a much deserved vacation.

In October, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said wearing masks "makes a difference" and that the politicization of masks should stop. "It almost becomes a political statement. We've got to get away from that," he said.
 A quarter of those surveyed by the KFF said the worst is over when it comes to the pandemic, while 51% said the worst is yet to come. While 19% said the coronavirus is or will not be a major problem in the US.
 Asked how much longer people are willing to follow social distancing rules, most -- 75% -- said they could tough it out another four to six months at least, with 70% saying they could wait until a vaccine was widely available, even if that means six more months of restrictions. Only 9% said they won't follow social distancing restrictions at all, according to the survey.
 Dr. Fauci had a similar message for people in the US. Earlier this week, he said despite the vaccines, the public won't be able to "throw the masks away" until the late fall or early winter of 2021.
 "It's not going to be like turning a light switch on and off. It's not going to be overnight. It's going to be gradual, and I think we will know when we see the level of infection in the country at a dramatically lower level than it is right now that we can start gradually tiptoeing towards normality," Dr. Fauci said during a Center for Strategic and International Studies virtual health event.
 "I don't believe we're going to be able to throw the masks away and forget about physical separation in congregate settings for a while, probably likely until we get into the late fall and early next winter, but I think we can do it," he added.
 People were more equally divided about media coverage of the pandemic. Just over a third said media coverage generally exaggerated the severity of the coronavirus, 36% said it was generally correct and a quarter said it was generally underestimated.
 About half of those polled said they want the incoming Biden administration and Congress to build on the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), while 14% want to keep it as it is. Another 29% want to scale it back or repeal it.
 The survey of more than 1,600 adults was conducted by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

Since then, the leg-spinner has made several attempts at making a comeback by writing to PCB and asking them to lift the ban. However, unlike Amir, who PCB welcomed with open arms after the southpaw served his five-year ban, Kaneria is yet to get any support which is why he was infuriated with the backing Amir got.

Norfolk-based NFU Mutual agent Patrick Verrell said the rise of rural retailers in 2020 has been "no mean feat".
 "Many farm shops have worked round the clock transforming their business model to meet demand, such as introducing click and collect services," he said. "Staff have adapted from serving in farm shop cafes to processing and delivering online orders, and stores have redesigned their layouts to offer Covid-safe shopping experiences.
 “Promisingly, 40pc of people say they will use farm shops and local producers more this Christmas and there are encouraging signs that these changes are here to stay.
 "There’s no better way to thank our farm shops and farmers for their hard work this year than by supporting them - not only over the festive season but into 2021 and beyond.”

Mannered Mutts Dog Training hosted Holiday Photos for pet families at The Animal Resource Cooperation in Hamburg to raise funds for Pawsitively Purrfect Rescue on Dec. 6.
 “(The purpose of this event) was to help bring some holiday cheer and remember all we have to be thankful for this holiday season while supporting a local rescue who has been devastated financially from a lack of fundraising events due to COVID. This time of year is all about giving, and we were so happy to be able to give,” said Dr. Pamela Kneass, co-owner of The Animal Resource Co- Op.
 “In this day and age, any reason to smile is a reason to celebrate,” she added. “All the pet parents had huge smiles on their faces, especially as they watched us try to get their dogs to sit and stay for photos! It's important to remember pets are part of the family, and rightfully deserve holiday photos of their own."
