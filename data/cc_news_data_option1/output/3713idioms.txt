“In Black and White” features two actors – a black man and a white man – the same age as George Floyd. As the white man lists all the similarities he has with Floyd, the black man reenacts Floyd’s final minutes. “A Deeper Look” features Buffalo filmmaker Isiah Gates in dual roles as a therapist and a patient. As the patient begins to describe the pain and fear he feels over Floyd’s death, a stopwatch runs next to the therapist’s notepad. By the time the patient is done talking, the stopwatch stops at 8 minutes and 46 seconds – the length of time that police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck.

“ _La Regione è un Ente Istituzionale che incide un po’ di più sulla vita del cittadino_ – ha detto - _E’ quindi importante che le persone vadano a votare, esercitando questo diritto e dovere in maniera convinta. Durante la campagna elettorale ho incontrato persone che hanno detto di aver smesso di votare, questa è una cosa sicuramente non positiva. Bisogna ridare la speranza a chi è deluso e non vuole più andare a votare. Io ci metto sempre la faccia perché se si è dentro le cose e si cerca di capirle, un cambiamento si riesce a fare. Questo è un mio invito a tutti ad impegnarsi e a fare la propria parte_ ”.

On Wednesday, the latest economic report seemed to support Powell's view of an economy on the mend but not fully healthy. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6% in August, the fourth straight gain but the slowest since sales started growing again in May. The figure suggests that the end of the extra $600 in unemployment benefits weighed on spending.

Christine Skeats, head teacher at Carrington Primary School, said: “We have an ongoing issue with cars parked inappropriately at the beginning and end of school days, restricting vision for children and their families crossing roads.                     “I have seen some close calls involving parents doing three point turns in large vehicles, narrowly missing children trying to enter school.                     "I hope the scheme will minimise these risks so children can walk to school safely.                     “Secondly, many families live within walking distance. Travelling to school using bike, scooter or simply two feet helps children keep fit and healthy and decreases emissions, which is good for the environment.”                     The scheme is one of several funded using a grant from the Government’s Emergency Active Travel Fund, helping towards a greener recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.

_Napoli, 17 set 12:03 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- "I due codardi ancora una volta in fuga. Negli studi Rai di Napoli è andata in scena la medesima gag di qualche giorno fa. Al confronto con tutti i candidati presidente neppure oggi si è presentato De Luca, fornendo il pretesto a Caldoro di scappare via a gambe levate e di sottrarsi dal confronto". Lo ha dichiarato la candidata alla presidenza della Regione Campania Valeria Ciarambino, a margine del confronto tra i candidati alla presidenza della Regione Campania nella sede Rai di Napoli. "Mai una campagna elettorale era scesa a livelli così bassi e infimi - ha proseguito Ciarambino - Mancando di rispetto ai candidati presenti, il comico De Luca e la comparsa Caldoro hanno mancato di rispetto a tutti i cittadini della Campania. Questo è il livello di chi ha già governato la nostra regione, fallendo miseramente ogni obiettivo e precipitandoci agli ultimi posti in tutti gli indici di vivibilità. A questi personaggi non dobbiamo più consentire di decidere delle nostre sorti e di quelle dei nostri figli. La maggioranza dei cittadini della Campania può ancora aiutarci a ribaltare qualunque risultato e a concederci la possibilità di dar vita al vero cambiamento per questa regione".
