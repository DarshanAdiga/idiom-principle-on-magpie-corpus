Sure, you can find them at hardware stores and online, but most likely you can't add a bag to your regular grocery order. Or, maybe you just prefer charcoal in general. Masterbuilt, a brand under the same umbrella as Kamado Joe, has designed a charcoal grill that offers the connectivity of modern pellet grills for a more familiar fuel source: the Gravity Series 560 ($500).

Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske told lawmakers Friday that she wasn’t aware of any fraud in the June primary, when Nevada mailed all active voters absentee ballots and only opened a limited number of polling places to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Limited polling places in Reno and Las Vegas resulted in lines of up to eight hours. The U.S. Center for Disease Control has issued election guidance to provide a wide variety of voting options and limit crowds at polling places.In the June primary, all Nevada counties had one polling place except for Clark County, which had three in the Las Vegas area. The bill requires at least 140 polling places throughout the state in November, including 100 in Clark County, which had 179 in the November 2018 election.Christine Saunders of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada said the long waits in the June primary demonstrated why Nevada needs both mail and in-person voting opportunities."No one should have to choose between their health and voting. No one should have to choose between staying in line to vote and making it to their job on time," she said.In states such as Colorado and Oregon, which have mailed all voters ballots for years, the procedure is cheaper than holding an in-person election. But Cegavske said the equipment, education, printing and postage would cost the Nevada Secretary of State's office an additional $3 million, not including costs to counties, which distribute and tabulate ballots. Nevada spent more than $4 million in federal relief dollars in the June primary, most of it funneled to counties. More than $1 million went toward leasing counting and sorting machines to accommodate a greater number of absentee ballots.Cegavske, the state's top election official and only Republican to hold statewide office, opposed the revised procedures. She blasted the Democratic-controlled Legislature for excluding her from discussions and said she saw a draft of the bill only a day before the vote in the state Assembly."We were not involved in this bill's writing at all ... I wish somebody would have asked us about because we could have told you what we had planned," she said Friday.To bypass Cegavske and enact the changes, the bill gives the governor the power to command the Secretary of State to adjust election procedures during a declared state of emergency. It passed on a party-line vote through both the state Senate and Assembly, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. Republicans were particularly distressed with provisions of the bill that expand who is allowed collect and hand in ballots. They warned it would enable a practice detractors call "ballot harvesting," in which volunteers working for political groups collect and turn in large quantities of ballots to tip the scales in elections."It's a safeguard that our state I believe we need ... I feel that taking it out — and it is in this bill — would be devastating, not only to us, but to our state," Cegavske said.Democrats argued allowing people other than family members to return ballots would help groups like members of Nevada’s 32 Native American tribes, who have historically faced difficulty voting and live far form polling places, and seniors who may need assistance with voting and fear venturing to the polls.In the June 2020 election, all voters were mailed ballots and 1.6% voted in-person on Election Day, a tiny share compared to the 34.2% in the state who voted in-person in the November 2018 election.___Sam Metz is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

As the demand for coal drastically declined due to the coronavirus crisis, the Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL)’s coal dispatches fell by little over 50% in the past four months in the current financial year (2020-2021).
 The SCCL recorded considerably low coal dispatches to the tune of 113.75 lakh tonnes during this period ending July 31 in the present fiscal, over 219.59 lakh tonnes of coal dispatches registered in the corresponding period last year, SCCL sources said.
 The SCCL’s coal dispatches were hit due to shutdown of several of its coal consuming units, including cement factories and scaled down power generation in various coal-based power plants in south India due to coronavirus crisis.
 The slump in demand for electricity due to the suspension of train services and closure of shopping malls, cinema theatres and other business establishments has led to sharp fall in demand for coal, sources added.
 The coal output also took a beating by over 45% in the SCCL’s Kothagudem coal mining area predominantly due to the coronavirus crisis and to some extent owing to the 72-hour strike by various Central trade unions against the Centre’s move to auction coal blocks for commercial mining last month.
 The Kothagudem Area comprising two each underground coal mines and OCPs achieved 22.5 lakh tonnes coal production as against the set target of 46 lakh tonnes in the past four months, sources added.
 The coronavirus scare continues to cast its shadow on the attendance of the workforce in the underground coal mines in the Kothagudem region, which recorded a couple of COVID-19 cases in recent weeks.
 However, the SCCL officials are hopeful that the production will be back on track once the coal consuming units restore their full operations in the next couple of weeks.

A third of all right-leaning academics say they've refrained from airing their views in teaching and research, compared to 15 percent of left-wingers.
 Academics lean further left than the general population. While less than one in ten Britons want increased immigration to the UK, nearly a third of academics support an increased influx. Conversely, while more than half of the population wants immigration lowered, only 16 percent of academics support this policy.
 However, the most divisive issue on campus appears to be Brexit. With only 17 percent of academics admitting that they voted leave, these leavers feel that the campus isn't the place to air their views. In fact, just over half of all respondents said they'd feel comfortable sitting in a meeting or taking lunch with a leave voter. _" [I've] been told leavers are fascists,"_ one leave voter who identifies as a _" centrist"_ said.
 Across the board, only three in ten academics think that a leave supporter would be comfortable expressing their views on campus. _" I told someone I had voted leave and they called me a racist,"_ one such supporter said. _" I voted leave but was scared to reveal this as my colleagues were so aggressive in their attitude,"_ another said.

The new phone is a further price cut for Google, whose previous midtier model -- last year's Pixel 3A -- cost $50 more. It also comes with reduced options. The 4A is available in just one size -- a 5.81-inch display -- and one color scheme, black with a pastel blue power button. The 3A came in two sizes and three color schemes.
 The device's screen stretches across the front surface of the device, covering all but a small "hole punch" camera at the top left corner of the display. The phone also does away with some of the high-end bells and whistles of the $800 Pixel 4, like Google's Soli chip, which uses radar to let people control apps by swiping and gesturing their hands through the air.
 The 4A's biggest draw, however, will likely be a feature shared with the Pixel 4: a premium camera that rivals those on Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S phones. (The 4A's camera doesn't include a second telephoto lens for extreme zooms that the Pixel 4 has onboard.) The phone is available for preorder on Google's online store, and will be sold on Aug. 20 through Verizon, US Cellular, Amazon and BestBuy.com.
 "We priced it aggressively," Brian Rokowski, Google vice president of product management, said in an interview. He added that the company made "trade-offs" with features so it could hit that price.

Once you're up and running, the Masterbuilt app keeps you updated on both grill and food temps. You can adjust both from your phone, in addition to setting any timers and alerts you might need. That covers the basics, and all of those are handy for any cooking session, especially longer low-and-slow methods for things like pork shoulder or ribs. And yes, you can keep tabs and adjust things away from home thanks to the 506's WiFi connectivity. But let's face it: leaving any grill unattended is a huge risk.
 The app does offer recipes, but there's not the deep integration I've seen on pellet grills from Traeger and Weber. There's no step-by-step guidance or even the ability to send temperature info to the grill. Of course, the 560 is around half the price of those smart grills, so it's no surprise.
 The app also allows you to turn the grill off remotely. However, you still need to manually insert a pair of metal slides to completely cut off the airflow to the hopper. Even then, the 560 takes a while to cool down enough to where you can put the cover on. Unlike Traeger or Weber, the app doesn't let you know when a shutdown cycle is complete as the controller turns off immediately. It's not a major issue, but it is something you'll want to keep in mind.

The World Health Organization warned Monday that there might never be a “silver bullet” for coronavirus (COVID-19), despite the rush to discover effective vaccines.
 The WHO urged governments and citizens to focus on doing the known basics, such as testing, contact tracing, maintaining physical distancing and wearing a mask in order to suppress the pandemic, which has upended normal life around the globe and triggered a devastating economic crisis. “We all hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from infection,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference.
 WHO says COVID-19 by far its worst global health emergency
 “However, there’s no silver bullet at the moment — and there might never be. “For now, stopping outbreaks comes down to the basics of public health and disease control. The virus has killed nearly 6,90,000 people and infected at least 18.1 million since the outbreak emerged in Wuhan in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.
 ## Probing virus’ origins
 The WHO began pressing China in early May to invite in its experts to help investigate the animal origins of COVID-19. The UN health agency sent an epidemiologist and an animal health specialist to Beijing on July 10 to lay the groundwork for a probe aimed at identifying how the virus entered the human species. Their scoping mission is now complete, said Mr. Tedros.
 “The WHO advance team that travelled to China has now concluded their mission to lay the groundwork for further joint efforts to identify the virus origins,” he said. “WHO and Chinese experts have drafted the terms of reference for the studies and programme of work for an international team, led by WHO. “The international team will include leading scientists and researchers from China and around the world.

 “Epidemiological studies will begin in Wuhan to identify the potential source of infection of the early cases. “Evidence and hypotheses generated through this work will lay the ground for further, longer-term studies.”

Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske told lawmakers Friday that she wasn’t aware of any fraud in the June primary, when Nevada mailed all active voters absentee ballots and only opened a limited number of polling places to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
 Limited polling places in Reno and Las Vegas resulted in lines of up to eight hours.
 The U.S. Center for Disease Control has issued election guidance to provide a wide variety of voting options and limit crowds at polling places.
 In the June primary, all Nevada counties had one polling place except for Clark County, which had three in the Las Vegas area. The bill requires at least 140 polling places throughout the state in November, including 100 in Clark County, which had 179 in the November 2018 election.
 Christine Saunders of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada said the long waits in the June primary demonstrated why Nevada needs both mail and in- person voting opportunities.
 "No one should have to choose between their health and voting. No one should have to choose between staying in line to vote and making it to their job on time," she said.
 In states such as Colorado and Oregon, which have mailed all voters ballots for years, the procedure is cheaper than holding an in-person election.
 But Cegavske said the equipment, education, printing and postage would cost the Nevada Secretary of State's office an additional $3 million, not including costs to counties, which distribute and tabulate ballots.
 Nevada spent more than $4 million in federal relief dollars in the June primary, most of it funneled to counties. More than $1 million went toward leasing counting and sorting machines to accommodate a greater number of absentee ballots.
 Cegavske, the state's top election official and only Republican to hold statewide office, opposed the revised procedures. She blasted the Democratic- controlled Legislature for excluding her from discussions and said she saw a draft of the bill only a day before the vote in the state Assembly.
 "We were not involved in this bill's writing at all ... I wish somebody would have asked us about because we could have told you what we had planned," she said Friday.
 To bypass Cegavske and enact the changes, the bill gives the governor the power to command the Secretary of State to adjust election procedures during a declared state of emergency. It passed on a party-line vote through both the state Senate and Assembly, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed.
 Republicans were particularly distressed with provisions of the bill that expand who is allowed collect and hand in ballots. They warned it would enable a practice detractors call "ballot harvesting," in which volunteers working for political groups collect and turn in large quantities of ballots to tip the scales in elections.
 "It's a safeguard that our state I believe we need ... I feel that taking it out — and it is in this bill — would be devastating, not only to us, but to our state," Cegavske said.
 Democrats argued allowing people other than family members to return ballots would help groups like members of Nevada’s 32 Native American tribes, who have historically faced difficulty voting and live far form polling places, and seniors who may need assistance with voting and fear venturing to the polls.
 In the June 2020 election, all voters were mailed ballots and 1.6% voted in- person on Election Day, a tiny share compared to the 34.2% in the state who voted in-person in the November 2018 election.
