Aitor Karanka says Middlesbrough must learn from their mistakes in a 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace, but remains optimistic about his side's chances in the Premier League.
 Daniel Ayala cancelled out Christian Benteke's opener at Riverside Stadium, but poor defending from George Friend eventually allowed Wilfried Zaha to net the winner early in the second half.
 "If we don't play with our intensity and style, which we didn't in the first 45 minutes, it is the Premier League and we are going to pay," Karanka said at a media conference.
 "We had a lot of chances in the second half and if we had played the same way in the first half we would have won the game.
 "When you lose a game through mistakes it is difficult, but we have to think about the future and learn.
 "We have lost the game, but we can't forget we are in a good position.
 "I think it's a really good game to learn and we have to think about the future. The club has done an amazing job building this squad, I am really pleased with them.
 "Now, we have to prepare for next Saturday's game against Everton. I told [the players] after the game we are in a good position and we have to keep going."
 Middlesbrough have collected five points from four games so far in the 2016-17 league season.

F1 was unable to officially confirm the situation surrounding the race when contacted by BBC Sport.
 Macron said France's lockdown would be extended until 11 May, after which creches and primary and secondary schools would progressively reopen, while bars, restaurants, and cinemas would stay shut. There would be no summer festivals "before mid-July".
 The move seems to make it impossible to hold an event that was attended by 135,000 people last year.
 The race would be the 10th Grand Prix to be called off at the start of a season that has been laid waste by the coronavirus crisis.
     * Formula 1: UK-based teams receive more than 20,000 orders from NHS
 F1 says it is considering all options as it looks for a way to reconfigure the season later this year.
 The current hope is that the season can start in Europe in the summer, and it is possible that the first races at least could be held behind closed doors.
 Ross Brawn, F1's managing director, said last week that a viable world championship season could be held before the end of the year even if the first race did not take until October. But he added that the season could run into January 2021 to fit in more races.
 F1 is facing a serious financial shortfall as a result of the lack of racing as all three of its main revenue streams are under threat - race-hosting fees, broadcast rights and sponsorship income.
 Only one race has so far been cancelled permanently - Monaco decided to give up on its event this year because it said it could not find a suitable alternative slot.
 All the others have been postponed in the hope of finding alternative dates once racing can get under way.
 The F1 teams are currently on a factory shutdown, having brought the traditional summer break forward from August so as to be in the best place possible once travel restrictions are lifted.
 Five of the seven UK-based teams have placed many of their staff on enforced leave as a result of the lack of action.
 And F1's bosses have taken a series of steps to cut costs with the future so uncertain.
 Measures include the postponement by a year of a major regulation change that was scheduled to come into force in 2021, and the requirement for teams to use the same cars for the 2021 season as they will this year.
 And bosses are in the midst of negotiations over lowering the budget cap that is set to come into force next year at $175m (£137.9m).
 A reduction to $150m has already been agreed informally and there is a meeting scheduled for this week to discuss the idea of potentially reducing it to $125m.

O'FALLON -- Charlene Gulliford at the Gandy Dancer never figured there would come a day when the Michigan restaurant known for its steaks and seafood would sell toilet paper and cartons of eggs, but the coronavirus has restaurants in survival mode.
   
 The popular restaurant in Ann Arbor now doubles as a grocery store, offering staples such milk and bread in addition to meats and fish from its own pantry -- and yes, even paper towels and the ever-elusive toilet paper. Sales began two weeks ago and the Gandy Dancer has found an income source to make up for some of its lost dine-in business, while also filling a need since traditional grocers are struggling to keep up with demand.
   
 "A lot of people are saying they're happy to support us, but a lot of people are saying, 'Thank you for helping us,'" said Gulliford, the restaurant's general manager.
   
 The idea is catching on nationwide. Stay-at-home and social distancing orders meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 have put restaurant dining on hold, forcing many to close and leaving others barely surviving. From large chains to mom-and-pop eateries, restaurants are increasingly turning to grocery sales.
   
 Panera this week launched Panera Grocery, offering not only the St. Louis- based chain's popular breads, bagels and sweets but items such as milk, eggs and fresh produce that its 2,100 U.S. stores normally use to make meals. Grocery items can be delivered or picked up.
   
 Subway is selling groceries at 250 of its stores in five states -- California, Connecticut, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington. Potbelly Sandwich Shop franchises launched Potbelly Pantry, offering mostly foods that the chain uses to make its sandwiches, such as meats, cheeses and breads.
   
 Panera's vice president of wellness and food policy, Sara Burnett, said the decision to sell groceries is a reaction to "the unprecedented crisis our country's going through right now." She wouldn't disclose how much the pandemic has cost Panera, but she said 30 percent of its business typically comes from in-restaurant dining, "and that obviously is completely gone."
   
 The National Restaurant Association says the industry has lost 3 million jobs and $25 billion in sales since March 1. Spokeswoman Vanessa Sink said 3% of restaurants have closed permanently and another 11% expect to do so by the end of the month.
   
 The move to grocery sales has been swift. Panera would typically spend months on a new business proposal, doing research, conducting surveys and opening test markets. Not this time. Panera Grocery went from an idea to launch in two weeks, Burnett said.
   
 Grocery items sold by restaurants vary greatly. Some offer mostly the types of things already in their pantries, such as meats, vegetables, fruit, cheese, milk and eggs. Others, like the Gandy Dancer, offer a much broader selection.
   
 Union Loafers in St. Louis is opting for quality, even if it means a higher price. The restaurant began selling locally produced goods such as eggs, milk, jams and meats on March 31. Co-owner Sean Netzer said patrons don't mind the higher price -- most items are selling out daily.
   
 The chain restaurants, which buy in extraordinary bulk, can afford to sell at a lower cost. Subway and Panera Grocery prices are comparable to grocery store prices, the companies said.
   
 Gulliford said the Gandy Dancer's prices are more than competitive and can even be cheaper than the grocery store's. For example, six lemons sell for $1 and potatoes are $1 per pound, she said.
   
 Many of the restaurants-turned-grocery stores are offering "contact-free" service in which the customer place orders by phone or online and the goods are delivered straight to the trunk or backseat of the car. Gulliford said the elderly, who are at a higher risk of serious illness or death from the coronavirus, are especially appreciative of being able to avoid going into stores.
   
 Restaurant operators aren't sure if grocery sales will continue once the pandemic passes. Panera sees this as "kind of a tipping point to see what our customers need," Burnett said.
   
 Gulliford said the future is especially difficult to predict during this unprecedented time.
   
 "It just really depends on what the new normal is," she said.

WASHINGTON -- A U.S. Navy sailor died on Monday after contracting the coronavirus aboard the U.S. aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, whose captain was fired after warning his crew would die unnecessarily unless strong action was taken.
 The sailor, the first active-duty U.S. servicemember to die from coronavirus complications, was admitted to intensive care on April 9 after being found unresponsive in his quarters. The sailor had tested positive exactly two weeks ago on March 30, the Navy said.
 "I am keenly aware of the dedication and commitment of our Sailors and Marines in service to our Nation -- in war, peace, and this unfamiliar time of COVID-19," acting Navy Secretary James McPherson said in a statement, adding that he would support their efforts and safety.
 So far, about 12% of the Theodore Roosevelt's crew of 4,800 have tested positive for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus -- in one of the most visible demonstrations of how the pandemic is affecting the U.S. military.
 A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said four additional sailors from the nuclear-powered carrier had been taken to the hospital to be monitored and were in stable condition.
 The official said that of the 585 personnel on the carrier who had been tested, 428 were asymptomatic while the remainder had shown symptoms.
 'Sailors do not need to die'
 Late last month the aircraft carrier's commander, Captain Brett Crozier, called on Navy leadership to evacuate the vast majority of the crew and to clean the ship in a letter that leaked to the public - embarrassing the Navy.
 "We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset -- our sailors," Crozier wrote.
 That letter by Crozier, which was obtained by a number of news outlets, set in motion a series of events that led to Crozier's firing and the resignation last week of acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly.
 Modly's resignation followed mounting backlash for his firing and ridiculing Crozier.
 The Navy this week is expected to release the results of an investigation into the events surrounding the letter, and officials have not ruled out reinstating Crozier, who is seen as a hero by the ship's crew, as captain of the carrier.
 The Navy has carried out much of what Crozier had been calling for. About 4,000 sailors have been moved from the carrier to facilities in Guam, where the ship has been docked after the number of cases started increasing.
 Modly's resignation highlighted the U.S. military’s struggle to meet increasingly competing priorities: maintaining readiness for conflict and safeguarding service members as the virus spreads globally.
 The episode deepened upheaval in Navy leadership. The Navy's last secretary was fired in November over his handling of the case of a Navy SEAL convicted of battlefield misconduct. The Navy SEAL had won the support of President Donald Trump.
 In a sign of the impact the virus was having on the Navy, it announced on Monday that another aircraft carrier strike group, the Harry S. Truman, would remain at sea, after completing a deployment in the Middle East, rather than coming into port to protect sailors from getting coronavirus.
 "In the face of COVID-19, we need to protect our most valuable asset, our people, by keeping the ship out to sea," Vice Admiral Andrew Lewis, commander U.S. Second Fleet, said in a statement. An update would be provided to the crew and their families in about three weeks.
 Sailors assigned to four carriers, including the Roosevelt, have now tested positive for the coronavirus.

Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone has highlighted the importance of Koke's opening goal in Saturday's 4-0 victory at Celta Vigo.
 The Vicente Calderon side drew their first two LaLiga games and initially struggled against Celta.
 However, they eventually cruised to a comfortable win after Koke broke the deadlock, with Antoine Griezmann scoring twice before Angel Correa made it four.
 "I am happy with the win and because our structure was like we have come to expect from Atletico. Individual talent strengthens our team," Simeone told reporters.
 "The first half was an even game. We started well, but Celta had some clear chances.
 "We were very strong in the second half after Koke's goal. You could see that we could hurt them with every attack and that eventually resulted in the goals that we did not score in the previous games.
 "A goal can liberate the team and put you in a good position."
 Griezmann, meanwhile, was over the moon with his side's performance and apologised for his comments that Atletico were in danger of battling against relegation if they did not improve after the draw versus Leganes.
 "I am very satisfied with the team. We put in a great performance," he added.
 "They were the better team in the first half, but we did things very well after the break.
 "I am slowly getting into the rhythm again. I am still missing something, but I am getting there. I am happy with my goals and the assist.
 "I am sorry for what I said after the last game. I should have kept it inside the dressing room and not gone public."

Colleges are increasingly spending more to woo affluent students with scholarships based solely on academic or other achievements, experts say. And it's leaving those who need aid the most with fewer resources to afford college.
 Students in the highest 25% income range received a greater amount of non- federal financial aid ($11,300) on average compared with all other income levels, including those in the lowest 25% income range ($7,500), according to a 2019 report on non-federal aid by the National Center for Education Statistics.
 Here's why colleges are giving more aid to wealthier students and how students with financial need can maximize available options.
 COLLEGES WANT WEALTHIER STUDENTS
 Affluent students get more school aid compared with students with financial need because colleges are actively pursuing them, experts say. Schools are offering non-need-based merit aid in order to attract students with wealth, especially if they're high-performing.
 It's a race for prestige, says Martin Van Der Werf, associate director of editorial and postsecondary policy at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.
 "Better prepared students, higher graduation rates and a better chance of attracting students who will later give back to the college -- that's the reward system that's in place," says Van Der Werf, adding that there's no similar reward system for helping low-income students.
 Colleges tend to choose students who will boost their rankings, and rich students often have characteristics that fit the bill.
 Rankings are always partially based on performance metrics: U.S. News & World Report's annual rankings, for example, take into account academic success and high SAT scores. Wealthier students tend to perform better on SATs, according to an assessment of SAT results by the Brookings Institution.
 Another factor in rankings is college completion -- national data show students from low-income schools are slightly less likely to graduate compared with students at high-income schools.
 SCHOOLS ARE COMPETING
 In an effort to compete with one another, private and public colleges are adopting a "high tuition, high aid" model, says Stephen Burd, senior writer and editor of higher education at New America, a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank.
 "It makes it more and more expensive for the people who don't get money, leaving them with more unmet need," Burd says.
 You expect to see a high price tag at private colleges, but now public colleges are getting in the game by raising costs and working to attract out- of-state students who pay more to attend.
 "It is derailing public higher education and why we have a public higher education system to begin with," he adds.
 FINANCIAL AID BUDGETS ARE LIMITED
 Families depend on financial aid to help meet college costs -- aid like scholarships and grants covers about one-third of college costs, according to Sallie Mae's most recent "How America Pays for College" report.
 But there's only so much money to go around when it comes to a college's financial aid budget, and schools must make choices about how that money is spent.
 From 2014 to 2017, non-need aid, or merit aid, among colleges grew 37%, compared with need-based aid, which grew 21%, according to a 2020 New America report that examines financial aid among 339 schools. These schools increased their non-need aid from $2.2 billion to nearly $3 billion over this time period.
 Some colleges are trying to give as much as they can to students, especially Pell Grant recipients, argues Robert Kelchen, associate professor of higher education at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey.
 But, he adds, that doesn't mean students will get the full amount of financial aid that they're qualified for -- colleges will give only what they budget for.
 HOW TO GET MORE AID FOR COLLEGE
 In lieu of sweeping change among all colleges to increase need-based aid, low- income students can still maximize financial aid that is available. Here's how.
 -- Since most aid is first come, first served, submit the FAFSA as close to the start date as possible (Oct. 1 each year). Complete the CSS Profile, too, if your college asks for it.
 -- Accept any Pell Grant money and work-study aid.
 -- Look for scholarships, some of which are need-based. Try the U.S. Department of Labor's Scholarships Search Tool.
 -- If you need a loan, borrow no more than 10% of projected after-tax monthly income in your first year out of school. Take out subsidized federal student loans first.
 -- Appeal to your college for more aid if your financial situation has changed since you filed the FAFSA.

Former Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-sung has made a surprise move to Leicester - by enrolling on a sports management course at De Montfort University.
 The 35-year-old South Korean - who retired in 2014 due to a knee injury - has signed up to study an International MA in Management, Law, and Humanities of Sport, which is run by the Swiss Centre International d'Etude du Sport (CIES).
 The course kicks off in Leicester, before tricky assignments away in Italy and Switzerland.
 "One of my colleagues said it had been a great experience and though many players go into coaching or management, I wanted to improve my knowledge of football around the pitch and then perhaps work in the South Korean football league," Park told De Montfort's website.
 After joining United from PSV Eindhoven in July 2005, Park won the Premier League title four times during his seven-year stint at Old Trafford.
 He was also involved in the club's successful Champions League campaign in 2007/08, although he was not selected in the matchday squad for the final against Chelsea.
 At international level, Park picked up 100 caps and also captained his country at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told punters to "keep your money" as he played down his side being installed as second favourites to win the Premier League.
 Klopp's men have impressed during the opening weeks of the season, winning on the road at Arsenal and Chelsea and scoring nine times over their past two home matches against Leicester City and Hull City.
 Leaders Manchester City are viewed as the frontrunners for the title at present having won six from six in the top flight.
 Ex-Borussia Dortmund boss Klopp could resume title tussles with City manager Pep Guardiola – an old adversary from the latter's time in charge of Bayern Munich – but he knows there is a long way to go before medals are handed out.
 "I don't understand the numbers," he said in a good-humoured appearance on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football programme.
 "I know where I come from, you keep your money, you don't do something like this!
 "It is not important for me but it is better to have an optimistic mood around.
 "At this moment, Liverpool feels good. We had this very important game against Hull and we did it in a really impressive way.
 "It’s nice to see [the table] but the one problem is the number, it is six games now so it’s at an early stage which is the only problem. I’m happy about this but I know there is a long way to go."
 The vast number of title aspirants gives the Premier League a different flavour to other major competitions in Europe, according to Klopp.
 "Everybody asks which is the best league and I have no idea, but that seven or eight teams think they should be top of the table or top of the league, that’s quite interesting and we all have to cope with it," he added.
 "It's good for everybody that watches it and we have to deal with the pressure."

ATLANTA (KU Athletics) – Kansas junior Marcus Garrett has been named the 2020 Naismith Defensive Player of the Year, the Atlanta Tipoff Club announced Wednesday. Garrett won the honor after being named one of four finalists along with Ashton Hagans (Kentucky), Tre Jones (Duke) and Mark Vital (Baylor). Garrett and DiDi Richards of Baylor, the Naismith Women’s Defensive Player of the Year winner, were chosen by the Atlanta Tipoff Club’s board of selectors, comprised of leading journalists from around the country, who based their selections on outstanding on-court defensive performances during the 2019-20 regular college basketball season. Each winner will be honored with a ceremony at a later date. “First, I would like to thank God. I would also like to thank my coaches and teammates because these awards are won as a team, not individually. I’d also like to thank the Naismith Awards voters,” Garrett said. “We had a great season as did the other finalists who were also worthy of this award. I hope and pray all are safe with the current happenings worldwide, and we get back to normalcy soon. Rock Chalk!” Garrett led the Big 12 in assists (4.6) and assist-to-turnover ratio (2.7). The guard from Dallas also ranked among the Big 12 leaders in steals (fifth at 1.8). Garrett averaged 4.5 deflections per game this season, including 6.9 in his last nine outings for No. 1 Kansas. For the season, Garrett averaged 9.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. He was the 2020 Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, USBWA All-District VI, All-Big 12 Second/Third Team and a unanimous Big 12 All- Defensive Team selection. This is the third year of the Naismith Defensive Player of the Year Award. West Virginia’s Jevon Carter was the inaugural recipient in 2018 and Matisse Thybulle of Washington was last year’s honoree.

April 9 - To the Editor,
   
 In response to the letter from a New Hampshire tenant, here is why real estate is an essential business.
   
 Real estate activities contribute nearly 20% of New Hampshire's gross product so to totally shut that down would have a huge economic impact.
   
 All the other essential businesses in New Hampshire are operating in new and different ways, real estate is no exception. One big difference is that we now have no public open houses so no large groups of people will be touring any New Hampshire properties for sale in the near future.
   
 For the safety of our clients, ourselves, and all others we also have guidelines from the National Association of Realtors as well as the Center for Disease Control. Some of these include use of hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and a limited number of people at property showings.
   
 All New Hampshire Realtors have been made aware of these guidelines and follow them for the safety of our clients, customers and others.
   
 If you are a tenant in New Hampshire, you have not given up any of your rights if the property you rent happens to be for sale. You may request to your landlord that it not be shown. Any decisions there would be between you and your landlord.
   
 You may also leave during showings. That could be a great opportunity to get some fresh air and exercise. Homeowners are typically also not present during showings.
   
 Even if the property sells during your tenancy you cannot be evicted for at least 90 days although you must continue paying rent.
   
 And finally, if you have a lease, any future owners would also be bound by the language of that lease until it expired.

NEW ORLEANS, La. (WVUE) -A COVID-19 survivor shares his experience with the virus and what his recovery has been like. Within a matter of hours, he says he developed double pneumonia and had to be hospitalized. “I absolutely tell people to take it serious. In full admission, I was one of those people in the beginning that was like it’s just like the flu.” Jarvis Lewis quickly realized it wasn’t like the flu. He says it started with headaches, a 102 fever, chills, sweating, a cough, no appetite, then breathing became difficult. “First thing they did was a chest x-ray and it was almost a 100% turnaround from what I had seen the day before, completely clear, no issues, the next day I had developed pneumonia in both lungs,” said Lewis. Lewis, the Chief of Staff for New Orleans City Councilman Jay Banks, tested positive for COVID-19 and had to be hospitalized. “It wasn’t until I was sitting in the hospital and they showed me the two x-rays juxtaposed together that I was like woah; this really could have been problematic,” Lewis said. Lewis is only 30 and says he’s healthy.“I had gone to my doctor to have my annual physical, he’s like your pretty good, keep up with your workout regimen, keep up with your change in eating habits. I had blood pressure issues in the past where it would run abnormally high, I cut salt in my diet, increased my water intake, doing a lot better, and hadn’t had those issues in probably 6 or 7 years,” he said.He offers this advice to anyone struggling with the virus. He says it’s something he learned in the hospital.“One of the things you’ve got to consistently do is, you’ve got to do deep breathing, you’ve got to do something as simple as stretching your arms over your head,” he said. Lewis says coming down with COVID-19 is the sickest he’s ever been. He says he started having symptoms around March 19th and he says they continued for about 17 days. Copyright 2020 WVUE.

Jurgen Klopp brushed off questions about Liverpool's ability to mount a title challenge following their 2-1 victory at Chelsea on Friday, instead urging his players to prove themselves on a weekly basis.
 First-half goals from Dejan Lovren and Jordan Henderson proved enough to earn victory for the visitors to Stamford Bridge - the result coming on the back of a 4-1 success for Liverpool against Premier League champions Leicester City in their previous fixture.
 However, Klopp broke into a smile when he was asked if Liverpool should be considered contenders to take Leicester's crown.
 "I'm really not interested in what people say," said the German. "Actually, it was the same question somebody asked me here when we won 3-1, last time here against Chelsea. It was exactly [the same], someone asked me are you challenging, or whatever, for the title. My answer was 'are you crazy?' - I remember it.
 "We have 10 points and that’s fantastic - really fantastic and I am really happy about it after these difficult fixtures.
 "The season is not over, we have to play football – we know we can play football and we are convinced about our quality. That's all the truth, but in the end we have to prove it every week - or in this week, every three days because on Tuesday we have the EFL Cup against Derby, which will be a nice game too."
 Klopp insisted there was no reason to be concerned over the fitness of striker Daniel Sturridge, who was replaced by Divock Origi after 12 minutes of the second half.
 "I couldn't see that he could sprint anymore, so that's why we had to change. We had a healthy, young striker on the bench. That's all," added Klopp. "The first half was really good - really good - from Daniel. We need this player there in the centre who we can play with and if there's a ball behind the line sometimes, so that we can go there and can push up in the last line.
 "I don't think there is an injury, it is only the situation. Nobody told me about an injury, so all is good."

Tottenham's Dutch striker Vincent Janssen is hoping to emulate the success of countryman Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Premier League.
 Van Nistelrooy earned cult status at Manchester United, after scoring 95 goals in 150 Premier League appearances.
 The former Netherlands international won the Premier League during his time at Old Trafford, as well as the FA Cup, League Cup and Community Shield.
 And while it is early days in England, Janssen - an off-season recruit from AZ Alkmaar - would like to follow in the footsteps of Van Nistelrooy, who was born in the same Dutch province - North Brabant.
 "In England they are just finding out that me and Van Nistelrooy are from the same area," Janssen said in quotes attributed to Dutch newspaper AD.
 "But I wouldn't say we're being mentioned in the same breath -- maybe that will come. I would think that's an enormous honour. I'm not as far as him yet."
 Janssen arrived at White Hart Lane as Eredivisie's top goalscorer in 2015-16, with 27 goals in 34 matches.
 The 22-year-old is yet to score for Tottenham in the Premier League but he has settled in well in London.
 "I've always felt a strong urge to prove myself. Maybe that's my biggest talent," he added. "I can tell the crowd appreciates the way I play.
 "Within the squad I was immediately accepted. We have a young, ambitious group, with no players who feel they've already arrived. That made it easier, I think. I really was accommodated fantastically."

There remains no official update as to when the 2020 college football season will start in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Until that time arrives, though, college athletic departments across the country are taking every measure necessary to weather the storm, and that now includes Washington State.
 On Monday, athletic director Pat Chun announced that he, along with football coach Nick Rolovich, basketball coach Kyle Smith and university president Kirk Schulz, would be taking a voluntary five percent pay cut. Furthermore, all those accepting the pay reduction would voluntarily forego all bonuses and incentives through the end of the 2020-21 academic year. That means taking about a $150,000 reduction from his $3 million salary for Rolovich, who's set to enter his first season at the helm of the Cougars.
 "We would like to personally thank Coach Rolovich, Coach Smith and all of our coaches for taking a leadership role during these unprecedented times," Chun said in a letter to the Washington State community. "As always, we will continue to examine long-term opportunities in operating expense efficiencies as we continue our budgeting process for the next fiscal year."

IEZA operates a second and unrelated business, matching freelance "content creators" with marketers. A content creator produces _"…Articles, Infographics, Videos, and Images that are delivered directly to the brand without distribution on your social channels."_ The freelancer uploads links to their portfolio. Behind the scenes, IZEA matches them with marketers. Most freelance matching sites let the participants make their own matches in an open market. IZEA takes a percentage of the fees paid by the marketers.
 Of IZEA's revenues in calendar 2019, 81% came from managed services, which is the company running the system for its clients as an agency, 18% came from SaaS, which is all the self-service fees. The company refuses to disclose how much of its revenues are from influencer marketing and how much are from matchmaking for content creators, but it appears the latter is a very small number.
 ## Market and Competition
 Influencer marketing has become big business. According to Adweek, the industry will be $10 billion in 2020. According to Mediakix and Business Insider Intelligence, the market was $8 billion in 2019 and will reach $15 billion by 2022.
 Influencers can make a lot of money. According to Mediakix, payments on Instagram can be up to $500 per post with 10,000 followers to $150,000 per post with a million followers. The number of followers is only partly the measure of value. There are dozens of other variables including engagement rates, type of content, and subject matter. The Instagram Rich List for 2019 from HopperHQ, tracks the top 100 influencers on Instagram and their cost per post.
 IZEA's most important direct competitors are Linqia, Collective Bias, AspireIQ, and Upfluence. But this is an extremely crowded market. According to Influencer Marketing Hub's _The State of Influencer Marketing 2020: Benchmark Report_, in 2019, there were 1,120 influencer marketing platforms and agencies, including 380 new ones created just that year. It isn't a surprise that most players are very small, with no one company dominating. $10 billion in estimated revenues for 2020 divided by 1,120 is only $8.9 million per company, after all.

Branislav Ivanovic feels Chelsea let manager Antonio Conte down with their first-half performance in Saturday's 3-0 defeat at the hands of Arsenal.
 The visitors were two goals down within 14 minutes following strikes from Alexis Sanchez and Theo Walcott, while Mesut Ozil added a third shortly before the break to put the match to bed, and Ivanovic acknowledged they did not stick to Conte's game plan.
 "We did not believe in what we were doing at the beginning and we were punished," the Serbian told Chelsea's official website.
 "As a team we did not answer anything the manager asked of us. We have to be honest with ourselves and put more attention on the small details. We have to be more focused and concentrated on the game.
 "I know it is very disappointing and it hurts all of us, but the opinion of everyone in the dressing room was in the same direction. We have to build on that, stay together, work hard, and believe in what we are doing. I am sure we can come out of it stronger. We have to stick together.
 "Nothing in life or in football comes easy, you always go up and down, but we know when you are in a difficult position you have to work hard and prepare for the next game. I hope we are mentally ready for the challenge."
 The result made it three league games without a win for Chelsea, leaving them eighth.

Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka insisted he was proud of his side despite seeing them slump to a 3-1 defeat against Everton at Goodison Park.
 The visitors took a controversial lead midway through the first half of Saturday's Premier League clash – Maarten Stekelenburg dropping the ball into his own net after he was clattered into by Alvaro Negredo – only for Gareth Barry, on his 600th Premier League appearance, to level shortly after.
 Goals from Seamus Coleman and Romelu Lukaku followed prior to the interval to seal the win for Ronald Koeman's side, but Karanka was quick to stress that Everton needed to be at their best to beat Boro.
 "I'm happy with the performance because of how difficult it is to go to into the second half losing 3-1 at Goodison Park to a team like Everton," the Spaniard told BT Sport.
 "I am very proud. Everton had to play their very best to beat us. When you score an early goal, most of the time it is really good, but not today for us.
 "It encouraged them and we lost our concentration. We were a little bit lost for 10-15 mins in the second half and Everton made us pay.
 "They could be a force this season if they play in the way they did today and against Sunderland.
 "We demanded them to play their best and when they do that they are a really good team with a really good manager who can bring on fantastic players."
 Middlesbrough's defeat is a second on the bounce in the league and a third in four games in all competitions.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden should “at a bare minimum” talk specifics about providing health care for everyone if he hopes to build enthusiasm for his campaign against President Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told The Associated Press.
 The freshman Democrat from Queens, New York, was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders and is closely aligned with his progressive platform, making her an influential voice as Biden tries to consolidate Democratic Party support behind his nomination. She spoke about two hours before Sanders endorsed Biden in a joint online appearance on Monday. Afterward, she declined further comment through a spokeswoman.
 Ocasio-Cortez said she understands some of the progressive ideas that Sanders championed during his unsuccessful bid — and that she supports — may have to take a back seat as Biden tries to appeal to a broader section of voters. But any platform of pragmatism, she suggested, must include a plan to win over millennials and people of color who might otherwise choose not to vote.

VanderMeer says he's been waking up in the middle of the night with a "feeling of a general dread and stress and sadness."
 "My fear is that what seems like such a patchwork system would indicate that this is going to linger for a while. That instead of being able to go to back to normal in say, four or five months, it might be 18 months to two years where this just keeps popping up all over the place because we have no national response to it. That seems like the most likely scenario. And that's just simply paralyzing."
 Robert Smith? (the question mark is the legal spelling of his surname) is a professor of disease modelling at the University of Ottawa who has written sci-fi fiction dealing with infectious diseases and apocalypses.
 He says the biggest surprise to him is how long it's taken for this pandemic to hit, given these things tend to happen every 100 years, and the last one was the Spanish Flu of 1918.
 He also finds it strange to watch the pandemic unfold in real time in the Western world, after living in various places in Africa and Asia that often deal with epidemics.
 "We're really the anomaly, and it's kind of just been a ticking time bomb. In most other places they know what to do about it."
 Smith? feels more contact tracing should be done during COVID-19, and more makeshift hospitals set up in Canada, like other countries have done.
 He's now incorporating COVID-19 into one of his next books, which was going to be about diseases anyway.
 "Some of what I'm going to write is going to be changed because of the pandemic we currently have," Smith? says.
 Fiction writers generally will have a lot to mine from our situation, he adds.
 "Between potentially apocalyptic catastrophes, to the psychological effects of people stuck at home and what all that means — there's all kinds of micro changes that can happen."
 But Mandel hopes there won't be a huge wave of coronavirus novels that will come out of this time.
 "I believe it's hard to write about something that everybody experienced," she says. "We're kind of all going through this, and it would be hard to write a coronavirus novel that was different from all the other coronavirus novels. So that will be a small challenge for writers in the future."

Like many schools across the state waiting for a decision on their spring season, Boonville was no different in that respect.
   
 Unfortunately for the players and teams competing this spring, they got some unsettling news on Thursday when MSHSAA announced that they were canceling all spring competitions.
   
 Following Missouri Governor Mike Parson's announcement of in-person school closure for the remainder of the school year, MSHSAA announced the cancellation of all remaining post-season events for the 2019-20 school year.
   
 "This decision is very difficult for all involved especially given the impact it will have on our students, parents, coaches, teachers, and administrators throughout the state," said MSHSAA Executive Director Dr. Kerwin Urhahn. "We thank all of the participants, the coaches/directors/advisors, the administrations, the parents, and everyone else who has dedicated tremendous amounts of time, passion, and effort to these events."
   
 Continuing the statement, MSHSAA said the biggest impact of this decision will be felt by the seniors, many of whom have exhausted their eligibility without taking the field, court or course.
   
 "To our senior participants- we thank you for everything you have done for your schools and communities and wish you the very best in your bright futures," Urhahn continued. "While this is a difficult ending, the lessons you've learned and friendships you've made through high school activities will last your lifetime."
   
 "The MSHSAA office thanks everyone involved for their patience and understanding throughout this process," said Urhahn.
   
 The MSHSAA staff looks forward to the resumption of high school activities during the 2020-21 school year, and will continue work on those events at this time.
   
 With spring sports canceled in baseball, boys golf, boys tennis, boys and girls track and girls soccer, Boonville Athletic Director Chris Shikles first of all his heart goes out to the seniors. That's where my biggest concern is, Shikles said.
   
 "We've been in contact with MSHSAA throughout the last couple of weeks," Shikles said. "The executive director told us that they would stay right in with the schools and what was decided. If schools were out and not allowed to practice and participate, and if it was later decided that school was canceled for the rest of the year, than the spring sports season was canceled."
   
 As of earlier this week, Missouri was one of 37 states across the country still holding out hope that high schools could play some semblence of a spring sports season, according to the USA TODAY Sports Network.
   
 Boonville senior Josh Chrisman, a three sport athlete in soccer, tennis and basketball, said it's definitely disappointing because there are so many opportunities they won't get to experience.
   
 "It seemed like at all of the practices, Quinn and I always talked about how this was our year," Chrisman. "We got to live the experience with Francesco Bona and Luke Rehagen when they went to state, so it's something we wanted to achieve."
   
 Boonville senior Josh Polk also shared his disappointment on Twitter about not being able to play his final season in baseball. However, Polk did get to play his final season in football for the Pirates. "Thank you BHS and the entire community of Boonville for the best 4 years of my life!," Polk said on Twitter. "It's always a great day to be a Pirate."
   
 Boonville Pirates baseball coach Adam Arnette said he was disappointed but not surprised by the decision from MSHSAA to cancel spring sports.
   
 "I think everybody knew that once governor Parson canceled school for the rest of the year that MSHSAA would follow suit," Arnette said. "I'm sure the seniors aren't happy about it but they still have to understand. I obviously feel for the seniors not being able to participate their final season, but we understand with everything that is going on."
   
 Like everybody else, Arnette said he held out hope that Boonville would have an abbreviated season but as time went on and everything happening, you could see the writing on the wall after sitting home for two weeks.
   
 With six starters back from a 17-9 campaign in 2019, the Pirates definitely had high aspirations of winning a district title and advancing to the postseason.
   
 But that is all gone now with the season canceled before it ever got started.
   
 With four seniors on this year's team, Arnette said several were looking to go to college and one was looking to possibly play in college. The other two, he said, it was going to be the last time they played baseball and that may have been last season.
   
 "It's disappointing for them because they really didn't get to enjoy it and maybe they took that last season for granted not thinking it was going to be the last time that they stepped on the field," Arnette said. "It really makes you look at things. I saw one of our seniors made a really good post on Facebook and said he didn't take this time for granted and just wanted to thank everybody and that was Josh Polk."
   
 Shikles said was especially tough on him personally because he is not around his coaches. He said not being around the kids also makes it tough.
   
 "Remote conversations don't exactly help build relationships so it's been tough from a distance to work with coaches and tell them what the next step is," Shikles said. "That's been the toughest part, not being able to meet with the coaches and talk to them face to face."
   
 So what's next?
   
 Shikles said if the governor comes in and says no summer school than they have to abide by that, but if he says summer schools can start on a certain date than they'll abide by that.
   
 Shikles added that's kind of a wait and see. "Now we're in a holding pattern for summer activities," Shikles said. "Well see how this whole thing plays out in the next month and a half and then possibly get some direction on what we can do over the summer."
   
 Questions about the fall season will also have to be answered. However, Shikles said he will prepare like they're going to have a fall sports season. That's the only way he can go about business as usual, to get ready for the next step, he said.

Rumors of Utah Jazz All-Stars Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell not being able to salvage their relationship after testing positive for COVID-19 are greatly exaggerated, if you are to ask the French big man.
 Prior to his positive diagnosis, Gobert displayed a cavalier attitude toward the situation, as he had reportedly been careless in the locker room in terms of touching other players and their belongings despite warnings about the severity of the situation. Shortly thereafter, Mitchell also tested positive for the coronavirus.
 Though Mitchell was understandably hesitant to patch things up at first, Gobert said the two have talked recently and in turn have gotten back on the same page.
 "It's true that we didn't speak for a while after this, but we spoke a few days ago," Gobert said on Instagram Live on Sunday, via ESPN. "We're both ready to go out there and try to win a championship for this team ... It's not about being unprofessional. You know, everyone has got different relationships -- it's never perfect. People that are married, it's never perfect. So you know, me and my teammates, it's far from perfect. But at the end of the day, we both want the same thing -- and it's winning. We're both grown men, and we both are going to do what it takes to win.

Juventus midfielder Sami Khedira understands Manchester United's stance over Bastian Schweinsteiger, but feels his former Germany team-mate deserves better.
 Schweinsteiger, 32, has been frozen out at Old Trafford, seemingly not in manager Jose Mourinho's plans.
 Khedira has been unimpressed by the treatment of Schweinsteiger, who played his final Germany game on Wednesday, at the Premier League giants.
 "I would never be in a situation that a club asks me to go," he told Welt am Sonntag.
 "A player with a great career does not deserve that one eventually tells him, 'Hey, you go'."
 Khedira added: "Overall, I find the situation a pity because Bastian for me is a player to whom I have looked up to."
 However, Khedira understands the stance of United, the club Schweinsteiger joined from Bayern Munich in July last year.
 "On the other hand, one must also understand the clubs. Football is business," he said.
 "There is no gratitude in our industry. If Jose Mourinho has other plans, you have to accept that."

Manchester United loanee Adnan Januzaj is hoping to prove himself in the Premier League by helping Sunderland to win matches - starting against Everton on Monday.
 David Moyes' side are yet to taste victory this season, having seen previous manager Sam Allardyce depart for the England job shortly before the campaign kicked off.
 But Januzaj, who has impressed in his early showings for Sunderland, is confident his new club will get their first win soon.
 "As I've said my objective is to play games and show people what I can do," the Belgian winger told Sunderland's official website.
 "I'm looking forward to the next few weeks because we're playing a lot of games against some very good teams.
 "We're hoping for our first win of the season on Monday against Everton and to do it at the Stadium of Light would make it even better."
 Moyes endured a number of frustrations in the transfer window, but, alongside Januzaj, he was able to bring in Jason Denayer from Manchester City on another temporary deal.
 And the defender is someone Januzaj knows well, counting him as an international team-mate and close friend.
 "Jason is a very good friend so it's great to see him join me at Sunderland," he added.
 "He will bring a lot to the club; he is a strong defender but he's also very relaxed on the ball, and you can tell why he fits so well with the national team."

Fears of ‘Wild West’ as COVID-19 blood tests hit the market

My Chinese associates like to quote this saying "上得山多，终遇虎" which literally means those who go to the hills often would eventually 'meet' a tiger. In the context of COVID-19, if one chooses to ignore the warnings for social distancing and continue to gather in groups in close proximity, the person could eventually be infected by a spreader. In the context of investments, it's a jungle out there and inevitably we encounter some ferocious wild animals who take a bite of our pockets or even eat us alive figuratively.
 For us who choose to own the stocks of Chinese companies, there's the perennial concern whether their financials are authentic and doubts fly whenever there are reports from short-sellers that appear highly convincing at first glance. To make the matter worse, once in a blue moon, we have some management having to admit to fraudulent practices in their companies.
 Coincidentally or otherwise, we have the confluence of both short-seller reports and self-admissions within a week and three at that. Starbucks (SBUX) challenger in China Luckin Coffee (LK) was the first to drop a bombshell on April 2.

There are some easy explanations for this shift (which could shift again): First, the governors are getting better ratings than the President. That, of course, is the kiss of death.

That figure makes Trump's grade -- 46% -- pale in comparison.

So, you know, and if you don’t then you would obviously not treat that as base cash rent and that would only be recognized on a cash base when you get paid at some time down the road.
