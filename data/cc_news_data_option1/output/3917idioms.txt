Carey describes her brother Morgan as violent, often getting into fistfights with their father and once knocking their mother out cold. When a cop found Mariah crying on the floor after one incident, he muttered, “If this kid makes it, it’ll be a miracle.”


  Her sister’s adult boyfriend, whom she later calls a “pimp,” took Carey to a drive-in movie. He “pushed in closer and forced a hard kiss on me,” Carey writes, while a gun sat on his lap. A bystander, a “prayer in person,” noticed what was happening, so her sister’s boyfriend backed off and drove her home in silence.

Now, this new rumor says spring 2021 is being eyed for season five, and that is just fine by fans. The spring season begins in April for anime series and ends in June. It is likely that season five will be a two-cour affair with its first-half going live in April and the second half in July. This is par for the course as _My Hero Academia_ seasons one through three stuck to such a schedule. The most recent season bucked the trend by airing in October and wrapping in April. But should this new rumor be true, season five will go back to its roots with a spring release window.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Flames devoured swaths of brush and trees in Northern California on Wednesday amid unseasonably hot and dry weather.High winds that spread new fires this week in the Napa and Sonoma wine country and in a far northern area of the state were reduced to breezes, but vegetation remained ripe for burning in high temperatures amid very low humidity.The National Weather Service said the weather conditions would last for several days due to high pressure centered over the state. Heat advisories were in effect or pending along about three-quarters of the California coast and many areas had poor air quality due to smoke.Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger wildfires in America to global warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas, especially because climate change has made California much drier. A drier California means plants are more flammable.About 70,000 people were under evacuation orders in the wine region north of San Francisco where the Glass Fire has incinerated dozens of homes along with winery installations and other buildings.The Napa County Sheriff’s Office posted&nbsp;photos and video&nbsp;of a hellish scene of fires raging on forested hillsides at midnight close to a highway in the western part of the county.About 150 miles (241 kilometers) to the north, there was no containment reported for the Zogg Fire, which also erupted during Sunday’s high winds and grew quickly, killing three people.The Glass and Zogg fires are among nearly 30 wildfires burning in California. Fire-related deaths total 29.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The headset itself is, and I can't stress this enough, very white. That's perfectly OK for an easily-cleaned plastic housing but the stretchy fabric band feels like it wants to pick up dirt, which admittedly is more of a problem when doing photography around rocks than playing inside. The headset feels light enough, and comparing the stats its 503 grams means it only weighs a bit more than the CV1 and is close enough to the Rift S to make no difference. The plastic rim with the foam padding around the eyepiece pops off with a bit of a wiggling, and that smaller black rim goes between it and the Quest 2's body to extend the internal area enough for people to wear their glasses inside. As the small cardboard insert says, the lenses slide left and right to click into one of three positions for people whose eyes are closer together or farther apart, and the plastic housing around them extend far enough forward that there's no need to get your fingers on the glass during the process. Also, it's a shame you're not supposed to expose the Quest's fresnel lenses to sunlight because the concentric rings look great in it.

The hit party game _Among Us_ has been enjoying a surge in popularity recently thanks to renewed attention from streamers and influencers, and with that popularity comes many questions about the game's features and its future. One of the questions that's often come up lately is whether the game supports cross-play or not and how people can connect with others across different platforms. Fortunately for _Among Us_ players, it does support cross-play, and it makes playing with your friends pretty simple.


   _Among Us_ is currently available on the PC platform through Steam and itch.io and is on mobile devices through the App Store and Google Play. Regardless of which platform you're playing on, you can easily play with others via cross-play. Thanks to the nature of the game and its simple controls, there aren't any platform advantages either, so players will be on a level playing field regardless of what platform they're on.


  To make the cross-play feature even easier to use, it requires no additional steps other than what players would already do to hop into a game on one platform. If you want to play with your friends, you simply enter the room code like normal to put you all in the same game. You could always hop into a random game if you want and your friends aren't around, but given the party game nature of _Among Us_ , it's better played with friends.


  Outside of the mobile and PC platforms, you don't have to worry about _Among Us_ cross-play anywhere else right now since the game isn't available on consoles. There's a chance that it could one day come to the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One platforms, but that's something the developer has only looked into at this point.


  Forest Willard, the co-founder of _Among Us_ creator InnerSloth, recently addressed the topic of console versions of the game and said it was something the team was "starting to talk about."


  0comments


  "But we'd have to write a system for quick comms," Willard said recently. "It'd basically be for randoms, like _Rocket League_. I don't know if we'd be able to implement console voice chat or not. I know one of the first things we'd want to add is a friend's list-type account system because it's real hard to do anything without that shit."


   _Among Us_ at least supports cross-play for the available mobile and PC platforms though, so be sure to take advantage of that feature regardless of what platform you and your friends are on next time you play.

Brazil's unemployment rate hit a record 13.8 percent from May to July as Latin America's biggest economy suffered the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, according to official figures released Wednesday.


  The rate is the highest since the data set began in 2012, and two percentage points above the same period last year.


  The previous record -- 13.7 percent -- was registered in the first quarter of 2017, on the back of the worst recession in Brazilian history.


  There were 13.1 million people looking for work in July, IBGE said.


  The number of people who dropped out of the work force -- a sign of how many have given up looking for jobs because of a lack of opportunities -- also hit a record, at 5.8 million, a 20-percent increase from the same period last year.


  "Besides taking people's jobs, the pandemic made it difficult to look for work because of stay-at-home measures, business closures and health issues," said IBGE official Adriana Beringuy.


  In all, Brazil lost 11.6 million jobs in a year, the institute said.


  The South American giant of 212 million people has been hit hard by the new coronavirus, with nearly 143,000 people killed, the second-highest death toll worldwide after the United States.


  Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has attacked stay-at-home measures imposed by state and local authorities and insisted on getting the economy reopened.


  But economists say the policy fight may only be adding to the economic damage. And health experts warn that many states are trying to exit lockdown too fast.


  \- Uncertain rebound -


  Brazil is facing a record recession this year. The central bank is currently predicting an annual contraction of 5.04 percent -- though the outlook has been improving steadily.


  Two months ago, the forecast was for a contraction of 6.5 percent.


  Brazil tumbled into recession in the second quarter of the year with a record plunge of 9.7 percent in Gross Domestic Product, after a contraction of 2.5 percent in the first quarter.


  IBGE said at the time that the health crisis had set the nation's economy back to the same level as 2009, at the height of the global financial crisis.


  However, some economic indicators are starting to show signs of recovery.


  Industrial output increased eight percent from June to July.


  Consumer spending is also on the rebound -- though that is largely thanks to emergency stimulus checks of 600 reais ($110) a month the government has been paying to around 60 million Brazilians, about a third of the population.


  The payments were halved this month, and are set to expire at the end of the year.


  Unlike the figures for production and consumption, however, "the labor market is still not showing consistent signs of recovery... which could restrict the future pace of the broader economic recovery," the central bank said this month.

In every event I did, strangers and I would bond, heart to heart, and reignite the spirit that lives in us. Every time I stood up to speak in front of people, there was no separation between me and them. I poured my heart out. I went beyond the script into the experience of being in the moment, speaking spontaneously from my heart and wisdom into the hearts and wisdom of others. So often at the end of events people would come up to me and say, “What you said was meant for me. I felt my heart burst open. I really let go of something.” I always felt the magical conversion of my human self and the larger spirit in me. I always left every event feeling fulfilled and blissful, in awe at the expansion of the human heart. It was beyond anything I could even describe. When I spoke, I felt his pleasure!

In juli zegden de wethouders het vertrouwen in de burgemeester op. De wethouders voelden zich bij herhaling niet gesteund door de burgemeester.


  „Eén ding is volstrekt helder geworden”, liet Brenninkmeijer woensdag weten. „De bestuurlijke situatie is dermate ingewikkeld dat het nodig is dat op diverse posities, anderen, onbevangen, vrij van het verleden en met een fris gemoed en met een frisse blik het stokje overnemen.”
