Indeed, the message to voters is sonorously clear - elites have learnt precisely nothing from the past 10 years. In 2008, people paid the price for dysfunction in the banking industry; today they must foot the bill for shortcomings in the energy industry, which is further away from a carbon-free breakthrough than it should be. Still, why tackle the source of problems when you can administer "tough medicine" to the masses?

Whatever Nkoloso's purposes, the Zambian Space Program has attracted new attention in the years since documentary footage of its facilities and training procedures found its way to Youtube. This fascinatingly eccentric chapter in the history of man's heavenward aspirations has become the subject of short documentaries like the one from SideNote at the top of the post, as well as the subject of artworks like the short film Afronauts above. Nkoloso died more than 30 years ago, but he now lives on as an icon of Afrofuturism, a movement (previously featured here on Open Culture) at what Serpell calls "the nexus of black art and technoculture." No figure embodies Afrofuturism quite so thoroughly as Sun Ra, who transformed himself from the Alabama-born Herman Poole Blount into a peace-preaching alien from Saturn. Though Nkoloso never seems to have met his American contemporary, such an encounter would surely, as a subject for Afrofuturistic art, be truly out of this world.

Many people associate the opioid crisis with rundown industrial towns, as highlighted in J.D. Vance's account of how prescription drugs ravaged his community in Hillbilly Elegy, but Pennsylvanians know all too well that this epidemic has set up shop in neighborhoods of every type.
   
 Opioids are not partial when deciding which Pennsylvania communities to infiltrate. In 2017, there were 5,377 deaths here due to drug overdose, reaching 97% of all counties. In the past decade, drug overdoses have increased within each demographic nationwide. A troubling two-thirds of these deaths are due to opioids.
   
 Americans nationwide have been demanding stricter regulations when it comes to the production, distribution and prescription of opioid drugs. Yet a congressional response to the opioid crisis has been devastatingly slow, and experts say the 2018 Support for Patients and Communities Act doesn't go nearly far enough to address the epidemic.
   
 So the question remains, if congressmen and congresswomen are supposed to represent the interests of their constituents, then why do bipartisan calls for opioid restrictions fall upon seemingly deaf ears? The answer is always money.
   
 The pharmaceutical industry has one of the largest lobbying organizations in the United States and has donated to the campaigns of 369 out of 435 members of Congress securing widespread influence when it comes to legislation regarding opioid restrictions.
   
 In fact, our very own Senator Bob Casey has received over $100,000 from the seven top drug companies since 2009. But their influence extends beyond Congress.
   
 Pharmaceutical companies have not only essentially paid off Congress to refrain from making any decision against their interests, they have also infiltrated the agency responsible for overseeing the industry, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). The DEA's role is to ensure that there are no abuses of regulations in the drug industry.
   
 However, when red flags started appearing in the form of extraordinarily high amounts of opioids being distributed to doctors and pharmacies, the DEA found it was able to do very little.
   
 Drug companies that were under investigation were caught poaching lawyers that were working with the DEA so that any case that was being built against them would have to start from scratch. When lawsuits were finally filed against them, sentencing amounted to little more than fines.
   
 According to a 2017 investigation, the pharmaceutical industry also influenced Congress to pass a law essentially removing the teeth from any DEA enforcement. The 2016 law prevented the DEA from stopping companies under investigation from delivering their illegal pills, thus allowing companies to continue their malpractice without hindrance. Political action committees (PACs) donated a total of $1.5 million to the campaigns of the 23 sponsors and cosponsors of the bill.
   
 The pharmaceutical industry is unfortunately just one of many that are part of this "pay-to-play" political atmosphere. Both liberal and conservative institutions have taken advantage of Citizens United and upended the democratic process. That is why a growing bi-partisan grassroots movement of hundreds of thousands of citizens and organizations like American Promise is working to pass an amendment that would reverse Citizens United and lay the groundwork for future campaign finance reform. Already 20 of the 38 states required for an amendment to be ratified have passed resolutions calling on Congress to propose a 28th Amendment.
   
 If we want to continue on as a democracy run by a government for, by and of the people, we need to come together and demand change in our electoral system. We need to ensure that our government can't be bought off in order to adhere to the interests of the few at the expense of the many.

Ward III Councilor Derrick Reed said he did not want to reveal what he had in his "back pocket" and declined to comment further. Ward IV Councilor Marlon Coleman said he could not support Johnson's proposal because he wanted to protect his donors.
 "I think it's important to protect donors from the types of toxic criticisms and negative campaigning we've witnessed during this election cycle," Coleman said. "People young and old and from all walks of life sacrifice what they have for the greater good to have a better Muskogee and don't deserve to be attacked because of their involvement in the political process."
 Coleman is competing for the mayoral post in a runoff election against three- time contender Wayne Divelbiss. Coleman said he had no plans to file a report this election cycle, while Divelbiss, who declined to comment on Johnson's proposal or councilors' lack of action, stopped short of pledging to disclose his campaign's financial records this year and has filed no reports during the 2020 election cycle.
 State ethics laws mandate reporting by most candidates competing in municipal elections. Candidates generally are required to file campaign financial reports if a municipality has a population greater than 10,000 and an annual budget of more than $10 million.
 Candidates competing for seats on Muskogee City Council are exempt because state law defines a municipal office as one in which a candidate files his or her declaration with the secretary of the county election board. Muskogee City Council candidates, in accordance with the charter, file declarations with the city clerk.
 Hammons tried three times to pass an ordinance requiring mandatory disclosure for municipal elections, but those efforts failed. A 2010 ordinance adopted in an effort to promote at least some level of transparency encourages candidates to file campaign contribution and expenditure reports 10 calendar days before an election and final reports 20 days after an election.
 The voluntary system has yielded varying degrees of success. This year only Johnson filed a pre-election report. Mayor Janey Cagle Boydston and Johnson were the only candidates who filed post-election reports.

But not even these innovations could prevent the global balance of force shifting against Britain. International rivalries intensified from the 1860s (after a half-century of peace since 1815) with the scramble for Africa in the 1880s and 1890s and the attempted partition of China at the turn of the 20th century. Otto von Bismarck’s new German empire – created by victories over Denmark, Austria and France – became the greatest military power on the continent. In 1871 Benjamin Disraeli warned that “the balance of power has been entirely destroyed and the country which suffers most… is England”. Confronting the expansion of a militaristic Germany drew Britain into two world wars during the first half of the 20th century, which cost more than a million lives.

After graduating from Olney High School, John joined the Navy and was assigned to a transport ship bringing service personnel back from the Pacific War Zone. As soon as he had leave, he returned home to marry his school sweetheart before being reassigned to the USS Tarawa CV40, and thus began a Good Will Tour around the world – a tour that lasted over a year. John began many different tours in the United States and Europe during his twenty-eight years in the Navy; from Newfoundland to Puerto Rico, Washington to Alaska and Newport. As a Machinery Repairman, he spent many years on the Arcadia and Grand Canyon while in Newport where he eventually retired in 1967. During his years of service, he attended many schools on both coasts and became one of the youngest men to earn the rank of Chief Petty Officer.

Arsenal v West Ham highlights – three points in the bag following a hard- fought win.
 The Arsenal v West Ham game yesterday was not a classic and the lads had to dig deep to pick up maximum points and with a little help from VAR and some resilient play, the lads emerged victorious.
 The Hammers probably feel a little hard done by that they did not get anything from the game and no doubt they will have a whine about VAR but from Arsenal’s perspective, this was a very good win because they were not at their very best.
 It is when you do not play so well but still walk away with three points that shows an improvement in both character and attitude. Put it this way, Arsenal would have lost this sort of game just a few months ago.

SOUTH BEND — City officials are working on a sweeping and bold overhaul of the city’s pet ordinance aimed at improving pets’ lives, reducing the number of them coming through the city shelter, and stemming their overpopulation in the community.
 Local animal welfare activists say they agree with the intent behind most of the proposals and they’ve enjoyed an improved relationship with the city shelter since director Jenn Gobel took control three years ago, but they have reservations about some of the changes and strongly oppose another.
 The changes, in the works for about a year and yet to be presented to the city’s common council for approval, would include requiring microchipping of dogs, setting new standards for keeping them outdoors, shortening the time it takes to ban negligent owners from having pets, and encouraging more spaying and neutering of cats and dogs.

 She was quoted as saying, "I have been pretty confident but it was more about ambition that took me where I was. But there were still doubts. And that can hold you back in many places. Another advice would be that do not let the guys get the better of you!"
 Before concluding the interview, Jacqueline revealed the one thing which she prays for men to remember this year in lieu of International Women's Day.

“Kemper County is a special place for me for many reasons, so to see them hire a top-notch dude and quality coach like Westerfield was huge,” Jones said. “He is well-respected in the coaching community, and he’s a winner. He’s an extremely hard-working, dedicated coach who will do well with kids and has a passion for them. He also understands the dynamics of Kemper because he played there and coached there. I think he will do a good job. Knowing him, I think he’ll preach to his kids about doing the little things right both on and off the field and try to push as many kids as possible toward college. I’ve always thought that he was a really good coach, and I’m excited to see him run his own program and be successful.”
 One thing Westerfield remembers from working at Kemper County in 2016 is how the football staff was able to get athletes at the school who weren’t playing football to join the team, which helped put them over the top. It’s something Westerfield says he plans to do when he gets back to DeKalb.
 “There are a bunch of kids not playing for whatever reason, and to get back to where you should be, you have to have all of your good athletes on the team,” Westerfield said. “I’m a firm believer in a kid playing everything. The more you do, the more time you have to stay active, and when recruiters come recruiting kids — I have a background as a recruiting coordinator — besides the obvious things like grades and whether or not you can play, they want to know if these kids play another sport, because that’s important to colleges.”
 Grateful for the opportunity he’s been given, Westerfield said he wanted to thank his parents, Charles and Geneva Westerfield, as well as his daughter, Trinity Westerfield, for their support.
 “I don’t feel like I could have been where I am now without having parents that prayed for me,” Westerfield said. “I have an 11-year-old daughter, and over the years I’ve spent more time pouring into other children rather than her, and she’s never complained. Without them, I wouldn’t be where I am.”
 Westerfield said his last day at Starkville is March 27, and he hopes to be on campus at Kemper County by March 30. His initial plan is to get the players in the weight room and assessing where each player is and what they can do. Spring practice for the Wildcats is slated to begin around late April.

“I’m pleased,” Gaskill said Thursday. “It’s a challenge to get anything through the Legislature. That’s probably good for the citizens that it’s difficult to pass legislation.”
 Gaskill’s legislation would amend Indiana law to read that the agricultural extension educator must be a resident of the county to serve on that county’s plan commission.
 In the event the agricultural extension educator is not a county resident, the county extension board will be required to select a resident who is a property owner with an agricultural interest to serve for one year.
 Gaskill said the bill was amended to apply to membership of an area plan commission.
 He previously said the Legislative Services Agency, which drafted the legislation, found there are eight extension educators around Indiana who don’t reside in the county where they are serving on a plan commission.
 In Henry County, the extension educator resides in Wayne County, he said.
 Gaskill had amended the legislation to allow the Purdue Extension offices to have their educator, if not a resident of the county, to be a non-voting member of a local county plan commission.

Vogo, a bike and scooter sharing start-up, is working on increasing the number of vehicles on its platform to about one lakh as it aims to more than double its revenue run rate to USD 120 million in the next one year. The Ola-backed company, which operates in Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mysore, is also betting on electric mobility and aims to have 20 per cent of its fleet as EVs.In the last 12 months, we have scaled the number of vehicles on the platform from 200 to 20,000 and the plan is to increase this further to one lakh in the next 12 months, Vogo CEO Anand Ayyadurai told PTI. He further said the company will deepen its presence in Bengaluru and Hyderabad, and is also exploring entering cities like Ahmedabad and Vijayawada.This will be towards the end of the year, he said, adding the company currently has about 20,000 vehicles across 500 spots. Founded in 2016, the company recently raised USD 19 million around Rs 136 crore in a funding round led by LGT Lightstone with participation from existing investors like Matrix Partners and Kalaari Capital.Vogo had previously raised money from ride-hailing firm Ola and Stellaris Venture Partners. In December 2018, it had formed a strategic partnership with Ola to boost Vogos supply by putting in one lakh scooters on its platform. Talking about its electric mobility plans, Ayyadurai said EVs form a big part of the companys focus.Currently, the number is small, about 200 but over the next three years, as we scale to about 3 lakh two-wheelers, we expect about 20 per cent of them to be electric vehicles, he added. He said the companys current average revenue run rate is about USD 50 million and Vogo expects this to grow to USD 120 million in the next 12 months.In the next 24 months, we would want to hit profitability, he added. Asked about recent layoffs, Ayyadurai said the company has been working on ensuring that Vogo is a low-friction platform.Over the last 6-9 months, we have been able to automate our entire fleet. So users can come and using their phones, get access to bikes. We dont need someone manning the docks anymore. New features that we now build in will be incremental in nature and wouldnt really need us to start from scratch. Therefore, we undertook a restructuring and about 40 people were let go from the IoT team and a few other roles were shed, he said. He added that the company now has about 260 people.However, we continue to hire in business development and software engineering roles, he said..

Trump's biggest ally in this misinformation is Fox News. An Reuters/Ipsos poll taken recently showed that Democratic voters were twice as likely as Republican voters to do even general precautions like hand washing and limiting travel (FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, PEOPLE, WASH YOUR DAMN HANDS!). If any of these billionaires REALLY wanted to save the country from Trump, the single best thing they could do is take that ad money and buy out the Murdochs from Fox News and shut it down. People will die because Fox News wants to fluff Donald Trump over keeping their viewers informed. Not only their geriatric audience will die, but people like me. And my nephew who had heart surgery at two days old. And my friend who is going through cancer treatment. And my elderly dad.

Now I'm sure my fellow women will join me in saying that this has been a long time coming. I remember reading how the suffragettes campaigned ceaselessly throughout the early 1900s to try and persuade The Royal Dutch Shell Group to add an apostrophe to their name, but no dice. Amelia Pinkspittle famously nailed herself to the entrance of the Shell Group's office where she remained for three weeks until she was tragically crushed to death when the managing director flung open the door to demand that she desist with her 'nonsensical lady-brained fripperies'.

So anyway, as is tradition, on the run up to International Women's Day we've seen large corporations falling over themselves to prove just how much they value women by signaling their virtue like the Bat Sign across all of social media. For instance, Shell, a British-Dutch oil and gas company, have added an apostrophe to their company name (at one of their gas stations) so that it reads 'She'll'. As in 'She will' to show support and solidarity with women's struggles.

Because I rarely - if ever? - pay attention to Andy Samberg at a gossip-level, I was pleasantly surprised by his Men’s Journal cover story. Did you know that Andy is 41 years old, 42 in April? Did you know that he’s been married to Joanna Newsome since 2013? Did you know that they have a two-year-old daughter and they’ve never released their daughter’s name publicly, and Andy still won’t refer to his daughter by her name in the media? I didn’t know any of those things. I also didn’t realize that Samberg is actually quite… respected and well-liked by colleagues across the board. This Men’s Journal piece quotes several of his female coworkers, and they all are like “he’s a really woke ally to women.” And he still behaves like a big kid who is just happy to be here, so that’s nice. Anyway, you can read the full Men’s Journal cover story here. Some highlights:

 That age thing is catching up with baby boomer skiers who statistically are often the bread and butter of ski resort clientele. The demographic is aging out of the ski hill, and the younger generation is taking up the slack in different ways.

 Many people associate the opioid crisis with rundown industrial towns, as highlighted in J.D. Vance's account of how prescription drugs ravaged his community in Hillbilly Elegy, but Pennsylvanians know all too well that this epidemic has set up shop in neighborhoods of every type.
 Opioids are not partial when deciding which Pennsylvania communities to infiltrate. In 2017, there were 5,377 deaths here due to drug overdose, reaching 97% of all counties. In the past decade, drug overdoses have increased within each demographic nationwide. A troubling two-thirds of these deaths are due to opioids.
 Americans nationwide have been demanding stricter regulations when it comes to the production, distribution and prescription of opioid drugs. Yet a congressional response to the opioid crisis has been devastatingly slow, and experts say the 2018 Support for Patients and Communities Act doesn't go nearly far enough to address the epidemic.
 So the question remains, if congressmen and congresswomen are supposed to represent the interests of their constituents, then why do bipartisan calls for opioid restrictions fall upon seemingly deaf ears? The answer is always money.
 The pharmaceutical industry has one of the largest lobbying organizations in the United States and has donated to the campaigns of 369 out of 435 members of Congress securing widespread influence when it comes to legislation regarding opioid restrictions.
 In fact, our very own Senator Bob Casey has received over $100,000 from the seven top drug companies since 2009. But their influence extends beyond Congress.
 Pharmaceutical companies have not only essentially paid off Congress to refrain from making any decision against their interests, they have also infiltrated the agency responsible for overseeing the industry, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). The DEA's role is to ensure that there are no abuses of regulations in the drug industry.
 However, when red flags started appearing in the form of extraordinarily high amounts of opioids being distributed to doctors and pharmacies, the DEA found it was able to do very little.
 Drug companies that were under investigation were caught poaching lawyers that were working with the DEA so that any case that was being built against them would have to start from scratch. When lawsuits were finally filed against them, sentencing amounted to little more than fines.
 According to a 2017 investigation, the pharmaceutical industry also influenced Congress to pass a law essentially removing the teeth from any DEA enforcement. The 2016 law prevented the DEA from stopping companies under investigation from delivering their illegal pills, thus allowing companies to continue their malpractice without hindrance. Political action committees (PACs) donated a total of $1.5 million to the campaigns of the 23 sponsors and cosponsors of the bill.
 The pharmaceutical industry is unfortunately just one of many that are part of this \"pay-to-play\" political atmosphere. Both liberal and conservative institutions have taken advantage of Citizens United and upended the democratic process. That is why a growing bi-partisan grassroots movement of hundreds of thousands of citizens and organizations like American Promise is working to pass an amendment that would reverse Citizens United and lay the groundwork for future campaign finance reform. Already 20 of the 38 states required for an amendment to be ratified have passed resolutions calling on Congress to propose a 28th Amendment.
 If we want to continue on as a democracy run by a government for, by and of the people, we need to come together and demand change in our electoral system. We need to ensure that our government can't be bought off in order to adhere to the interests of the few at the expense of the many.

 Surely someone out there in our great capitalistic society is already manufacturing a coffee mug emblazoned with those parting words from Elizabeth Warren, and as soon as those mugs hit the market I'm getting one. I plan to set it next to my mug that says, "Nevertheless, she persisted."
 Elizabeth Warren did persist, through many ups and downs of a presidential primary campaign that she suspended on Thursday. The numbers were against her, and one of her charms is that her persistence is matched by practicality.
 Heartbroken. Tearful. In mourning.
 Those were some of the words her supporters used in reply to the news, but they also talked about being thankful. Warren inspired many until the very end.
