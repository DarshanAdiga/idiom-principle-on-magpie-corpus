 “The phases get us back on the pitch and back enjoying each other’s company. It gives us the confidence to know we are doing the right things and taking the right precautions to make sure everyone stays healthy.
 “It’s going to be a different process, but it is something we’ve got to stay on top of. We need to keep doing the right things and I’m sure we will continue to have clear tests and get everyone back in.

 “You look at the facilities we’ve got access to now at Chadwell Heath, and the core part of the squad that we’ve secured on new contracts. We’ve got players now that understand this league.
 “We’ve just got to improve the depth and the competition. That will give us the ability then to push on and challenge those top teams. We’ve got a great set-up here.

The Lincoln Project managers were sure to have the ad aired on Tucker Carlson's Fox News program.
 In "Betrayed," an angry ex-Navy Seal rails against Trump's nonresponse to reports of Russians paying the Taliban to kill American soldiers. "Any commander in chief with a spine would be stomping the living s--- out of some Russians right now," Dr. Dan Barkuff says. He calls Trump a "coward" and "draft dodger," and in case you haven't figured out the audience he is focused on, Barkuff adds in passing, "I'm a pro-life, gun-owning combat veteran."
 Fortunately, the brains behind these videos, Wilson and Lincoln Project colleagues George Conway, Steve Schmidt, John Weaver and others, are on my side this time. And they remind the people they used to campaign against that there are patriotic Republicans who still put their country above party.
 I dream that these never-Trump Republicans become not a third party but one of the two parties -- a replacement for the shabby Trump cult now called the Republican Party. They might even change their name to the Lincoln Party.
 The never-Trump Republicans are the true conservatives. If they were to ever gain power through a new party, I imagine there would still be a number of differences between them and me. But in the meantime, I'll fetch their slippers, sit at their feet and pray the activists leave the Washington Monument alone.
 You guys may not be my forever home. But if this doesn't lead to adoption, I hope you'll at least foster me until Election Day.

Another 2017 video shows how Indian and Chinese soldiers threw punches and stones at one another in this standoff on the shores of Pangong Lake, another disputed zone nearby Galwan Valley.
 ## 'Piddliest' valley in the region
 The recent round of troubles may have been triggered by a decision by the India Government last August to split the state of Jammu and Kashmir into the two "union territories" of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.
 Just as in Australia, a territory has lesser autonomy than a state.
 That was followed in November by the publication of maps showing the new political division which incorporated the Chinese-controlled Aksai Chin into the boundaries of Ladakh.
 A quiet winter thawed into a spring of increasing discontent.
 In early May, about 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were involved in a violent fracas on the shores of Pangong Lake, another hotspot on the Line of Actual Control.
 Meanwhile, tensions were building near the Galwan Valley as both sides traded accusations over nearby infrastructure developments.
 The nearly complete 255km-long Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) Road connects the Ladakhi capital of Leh to India's most north-western outpost of Daulat Beg Oldie.
 The military-grade, all-weather road runs parallel to the LAC for more than 120km, giving India troops quick access to many strategic points along the route, including Galwan Valley.
 And after 20 years of construction, it is due to be completed later this year.

The team formed an all-women Walla group, a term that refers to a group of actors brought in during postproduction to record the murmur of a crowd. The Walla group ranged in size from eight to 18 women, who delivered performances including chants, sing-alongs and background voices. "I had the actors stand in different places in the room…and we had microphones in front of them, behind them, and [used] different styles of microphone techniques," Gershin explains. "I would have people facing the wall [and] in the center of the room, because I was recording not only their voice but the spaciality of their voice. If you do that five or six time and move them in different places, you could start simulating sounds of hundreds and hundreds of people. He adds that for the singalongs, "I didn't want that studio sound. I wanted to give it a very organic sound, a little detuned." There also was careful research for scenes where the women hit the road, to accurately deliver regional accents.

And the width of the bank suggests that it can easily accommodate a two-lane road. Another 1.3km upstream there is a larger Chinese camp.
 Satellite images taken on July 6, show that most of the structures and equipment along the river bank adjacent to the LAC have been removed, but the result of the frenzied construction work is still in place.
 Former senior US State Department adviser Ashley Tellis, who is now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, believes there was nothing accidental nor inadvertent about China's action.
 "It was clearly calculated and prepared for," he told a recent webinar audience, suggesting two motivations.
 First, "a series of accumulating Chinese grievances" going back to "India's cartographic aggression", he said, alluding to the new maps of Ladakh published last year.
 "I think the second has to do with a broader strategic question of simply re- establishing in their view of what the pecking order in Asia ought to be. And the pecking order is that China is at the apex of the hierarchy. And India ought to know its place."

During recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Little Rock, cops seemingly tricked by Facebook postings went around telling people that mobs of antifa activists were holed up in a downtown hotel conspiring to loot and burn wealthy suburbs.
 And then what? Return to their hotel rooms and watch porn, I suppose.
 Needless to say, nothing happened.
 Similar hoaxes have provoked armed vigilantes in Idaho, New Jersey, South Dakota and Michigan in recent weeks into taking to the streets to defend their communities against the largely mythical antifa. (Which is not to say there aren't self-dramatizing fools on the left, doing their utmost to accomplish for Trump what their political ancestors such as the late Abbie Hoffman did for Richard Nixon in 1968, i.e., provoke a voter backlash against their ostensible cause. Joe Biden can't proclaim his hostility toward arsonists and looters strongly enough.)
 The Washington Post detailed a scary episode at Gettysburg National Cemetery this July 4th. Spurred by Facebook postings on a phony antifa page that promised an Independence Day flag-burning festival at the park ("Let's get together and burn flags in protest of thugs and animals in blue"), a veritable army of militiamen, skinheads, bikers and right-wing zealots showed up locked and loaded to protect Civil War monuments there.
 Almost needless to say, nobody showed up to incinerate any flags. The mob did find a Methodist preacher wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt to harass, but park rangers got him away safely. All unaware, the fellow had been visiting an ancestor's grave.
 Post reporters Shawn Boburge and Dalton Bennett searched high and low for the phony antifa site's author but came up empty. None of the persons identifying themselves on Facebook turned out to exist; all the photos were stock commercial images traceable to nobody. The whole thing was a malicious hoax cleverly designed to trick foolhardy armed men into pointing guns at their imagined enemies.
 Armed men were goaded into a frenzy by Boss Trump, whose only hope of being returned to office lies in setting Americans at one another's throats.
 One day before too long, I fear, those guns are going to go off.
