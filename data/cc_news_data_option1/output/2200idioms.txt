The site, which calls itself the first page on the Internet, has long struggled to tackle hate and racist content on their platform Earlier this week, some of Reddit's most popular threads went private in an effort to protest hate speech and racism on the platform, according to Business Insider.
 Huffman has come under fire in the past for failing to take action on site communities where racist opinions and language are frequently thrown. Earlier this week he published an open letter, saying "we do not tolerate hatred, racism and violence, and while we have work to do to combat them on our platform, our values ​​are clear."
 Ellen Pao, a former acting Reddit CEO, criticized Huffman's comments. "I am forced to call you: you should have closed the_donald instead of amplifying it and its hatred, racism and violence. Much of what is happening now is at your feet. You cannot say BLM when reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hates everything the day "she tweeted, referring to a popular subreddit Support President Donald Trump, where users often share racist, misogynistic, homophobic, and conspiracy content.

Where we live, June evenings bring fireflies - "lightning bugs" dancing their way across the starry background.      This is a real pleasure of stepping out on a clear night in June. The field we have out back, darkened by the night, would look like a field of stars if those fireflies would stand still. Instead they move about, blinking on and off, a show in my mind coupled with the constellations above, beats any man- made fireworks show.      One night I was looking through my reflecting telescope and a firefly entered through the open end of the tube. You can imagine the distraction!      The stars, though seemingly unchanging and still, looking as they did to our ancestors of old, aren't all that different than the firefly. Like this flashy insect, the stars actually are in constant motion, and many of them "blink" \- mostly at very slow rates (days, weeks, months) as they vary in magnitude.      The stars don't seem to be shifting because they are so immensely far. A few though, are crossing the heavenly sphere at a fast enough clip and are close enough, that a user of even a small telescope could trace its motion over a few years. One of the most famous is Barnard's Star, in Ophiucus.      As darkness falls in mid-June - once the moon is out of the way - look southeast for the large constellations Ophiucus and Serpens. Note: Serpens is broken in two, on either side of Ophiucus.      Ancient Greeks depicted Ophiucus as the renowned physican Aesculapius, the inventor and god of medicine, holding Serpens the Snake across his knees. Ophiucus is also depicted standing on Scorpius the Scorpion, the constellation immediately below it and marked with a fabulous, bright red star, Antares.      Dr. Ophiucus, I don't think, would be recognized by my health insurance plan.      Barnard's Star is of 9.5 magnitude, requiring a telescope of about 3-inch aperture or larger to easily see. You need a detailed star chart showing the myriad of similarly faint stars to track down which one is Barnard's Star.      Although appearing motionless in the eyepiece, if you were to take photographs or very carefully plot the stars on paper, you could repeat this in a few years and see that Barnard's Star has actually moved.      It was discovered by Professor Emerson Bernard in 1916. He noticed it had shifted by comparing his photographic plate with plates taken in 1894 and 1904.      The star has the highest proper motion of any star we see, moving at 10.3 "seconds of arc" per year.      (A degree on the sky, equal to about two full moons, is equivalent to 60 minutes of arc. Each minute has 60 seconds of arc.)      Barnard observed that in 22 years the star moved by four minutes of arc - about a third of the apparent separation of the famous double star Mizar and Alcor in the Big Dipper's handle.      Barnard's Star is a red dwarf star and only six light-years away, among the very closest. Astronomer Peter Van de Kamp, in 1963, had become convinced that an apparent wobble in the star's path was due to the gravitational pull of an unseen planet.      His assertion was not vindicated until 2018 when a planet, 3.2 times the size of Earth, was discovered orbiting the star.   Full moon is on June 6.      Keep looking up at the sky!

More talks and negotiations are scheduled for the coming days to work out everything else, and it is a sizable list. A look at some of the other issues facing the league, both in the quest to finish this season and then what awaits in the coming year:
 TESTING
 The format was significant, but not the biggest hurdle for the NBA to clear in this process. That one, by far, is testing. The medical protocols are the most critical part of the return-to-play plan.
 The league and the players know they must go above and beyond in the interest of safety. The protocols are the key — players will have to practice social distancing when they aren’t playing, plus submit to a quarantine at the beginning of the time at Disney and likely daily testing for the entirety of their stay there.
 Players and coaches likely won’t even be able to have their families at Disney until September, at the earliest.
 A person with direct knowledge of the talks said the NBA and NBPA have been working on what will be lengthy protocols — which, among other things, will explain what happens when a player or coach tests positive while at the Disney complex.
 THE GAMES
 The season is set to resume July 31, with playoffs starting in mid-August and leading up to an NBA Finals that could stretch until Oct. 12.
 Other than Milwaukee and the Los Angeles Lakers, who are all-but certain of going into the playoffs with No. 1 seeds, everyone at Disney will be playing for something — a playoff seed or a playoff spot.
 The dynamic at the bottom of the East is fascinating with Brooklyn and Orlando separated by a half-game — and Washington just 1-1/2 games out of getting into a two-game play-in series for the No. 8 spot.
 Out West, expect craziness with six teams basically assured of vying for one berth.
 Whichever team emerges from that mess will be playoff-ready and loaded with confidence heading into Game 1 of Round 1 against the Lakers. That means the Lakers will have to be playoff-sharp right away, because LeBron James and his teammates will open against a team that’s hot.

 The Texas heat has not stopped demonstrators in Austin from protesting in the streets in downtown Austin for the eighth consecutive day.
 Since late last week, protesters have been gathering outside the Texas State Capitol and the Austin Police Department headquarters to rally against police brutality and racism in the wake of multiple recent deaths of people of color at the hands of police.
 In addition to George Floyd, who died last week after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on the back of his neck for almost nine minutes, demonstrators continued their calls for justice for Breonna Taylor of Louisville, Kentucky, who was killed by a police officer in a separate incident.
 Demonstrators in Austin have also been chanting the name of Michael Ramos, who was killed by an Austin police officer in April while he was unarmed.
 On Thursday, some of the protesters rallied against Austin police response to demonstrations over the weekend, when at least two people -- 16-year-old Brad Ayala and 20-year-old Texas State University student Justin Howell -- were seriously injured.
 Earlier today, four Austin City Council members publicly expressed their loss of confidence in Austin Police Chief Brian Manley, who earlier this week admitted that the Police Department mishandled its response to protests over the weekend.
 Ayala and Howell were both hit in the head with bean bag ammunition, according to Manley.

Just in case Major League Baseball owners were unable to see the line in the proverbial sand, Players Association chief Tony Clark drew it in ink Thursday night.
 In a statement released after a conference call with the union’s executive board and more than 100 other players, Clark reaffirmed the players’ desire to return to the field but also their unwillingness to reopen a March 26 agreement that stipulates they will be paid prorated salaries based on the length of a pandemic-shortened season.
 Clark also blasted the idea that MLB will use its authority under that March agreement to unilaterally implement a mini-season of approximately 50 games unless the players agree to further salary concessions, labeling it as a “threat.”
 “Players are ready to report, ready to get back on the field, and they are willing to do so under unprecedented conditions that could affect the health and safety of not just themselves, but their families as well,” Clark said. “The league’s demand for additional concessions was resoundingly rejected.”
 If MLB was hoping that the notion of the mini-season would bring the players back to the virtual table with a willingness to suddenly negotiate on salary, well, it’s not happening. The players’ opposition is as much about principle, specifically not revising a deal that has already been agreed upon, as it is about actual dollars.
 It seems, then, that the only way baseball will be played in 2020 is for commissioner Rob Manfred to go through with imposing a two-month season. And if he does, it’s doubtful the players’ union will sign off on expanding the postseason from 10 teams to 14 this year and next, a change that is strongly desired by the owners because of the significant portion of national TV money associated with the playoffs.
 MLB hoped to reach agreement with the players this week to resume spring training by the middle of June and open an 82-game season by Fourth of July weekend. Both MLB and the union had made one economic proposal that didn’t address the issue most important to the other side.
 In their proposal last Sunday, the players suggested a 114-game season at 100% of their prorated salaries, a non-starter to owners who claim they will lose money for every game that is played without fans. But Clark confirmed that the players also agreed to two years of expanded playoffs, salary deferrals if the 2020 postseason is canceled by another wave of the coronavirus, and other events and broadcast enhancements that the union believes will result in revenue for the owners.
 MLB rejected that proposal Wednesday and didn’t schedule further negotiations, instead informing the union that it was moving forward with plans for a mini- season.
 “We do not have any reason to believe that a negotiated solution for an 82-game season is possible,” deputy commissioner Dan Halem wrote in a letter Wednesday to chief union negotiator Bruce Meyer that was obtained by the Associated Press.
 MLB’s economic proposal, which was made almost two weeks ago, involved sliding-scale supplemental pay cuts in an 82-game season that would reduce the overall pool for salaries to be reduced from roughly $2.25 billion based on terms of the March 26 agreement to $1.4 billion. If MLB implements a 50-game season at 100% of the prorated salaries, players would make a total of about $1.4 billion.
 “In this time of unprecedented suffering at home and abroad, players want nothing more than to get back to work and provide baseball fans with the game we all love,” Clark said. “But we cannot do this alone.”

This story is part of our Senior Spotlight series where the Chieftain will collect stories from every local spring team's seniors in order to recognize their hard work despite a canceled season from the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Last season, East High School girls track and field's Shannon Vivoda fell 6.25 inches short of winning the Class 4A state title in the shot put.
   
 With last year's winner being a senior, Vivoda appeared to be the frontrunner to take the title in 2020.
   
 But the difference this time was more than just a few inches.
   
 It was a global pandemic due to the coronavirus.
   
 "It was something I was looking forward to since state ended last year," Vivoda said. "I definitely wanted the opportunity to compete for a title this year and represent East one last time, but I've tried to stay positive.
   
 "If sports have taught me anything it's that there's highs, lows and everything in between, but you just have to keep moving forward and be thankful no matter what."
   
 The 2019-2020 season wasn't all bad for Vivoda as she is also a standout on the diamond for the East softball team.
   
 She finished fifth in the South-Central League in batting average with a .520 mark, seventh in RBI with 27, third in home runs with five, and top five in both slugging and on base percentage.
   
 All of those marks were team highs outside of slugging, which fellow senior Nasya Madrid-Lefebre took by .002 points.
   
 On top of softball, Vivoda only participated in track and field her junior year as an injury kept her from the thrower's circle her sophomore year.
   
 Having limited time to learn the sport is part of what makes Eagles track and field coach Tony Valdez more impressed by her.
   
 "I could write a book about how impressive of a person Shannon Vivoda is," Valdez said. "Powerful athlete, witty sense of humor and a tireless work ethic. She's super talented but yet very coachable and that's why she is successful."
   
 Vivoda's success wasn't alone either as her fellow seniors in Alexis Martinez, Jayda Escajeda, Paola Michel-Flores, plus many underclassmen, were ready to make noise for the Eagles' girls team this season.
   
 "I was really excited for the team as a whole this year," Vivoda said. "The throwers had a lot of potential to go pretty far and place at state and compete throughout the city. We had a lot of great athletes competing in the other events. It was going to be a great season for all of us."
   
 Valdez agrees with Vivoda and believes the 2020 class has helped establish the program during their time at East.
   
 "The senior girls have been equally as important in contributing to the success of the program," Valdez said. "They have worked extremely hard to get to where they are at and will be missed greatly next year."
   
 Vivoda is heading to the University of Arizona after excelling inside the classroom her four years at East.
   
 While she may be heading to the desert, her roots in Pueblo are something the East Eagle doesn't plan to ever forget.
   
 "I think one of the biggest things that will stick with me is just taking pride in who you are and where you come from," Vivoda said. "That's something coach Valdez talked about a lot and how amazing it is to be an Eagle and to have pride in the place that raised you up.
   
 "So no matter where I'm at in life, East will always hold a special place in my heart and I want to give back however I can."

Greenfield estimated, weekly, they have given out approximately 1,000 kits, feeding four people for several days.
 “The people getting these meals are not the normal clients we see at our food pantry. This distribution reaches a lot of different people,” she noted.
 Greenfield said it is through the efforts of many people the give aways are able to take place.
 “I just want to recognize all of the volunteers that have played any role in making this happen. This is a huge blessing and there is no way any of it could happen without them. I am grateful,” she explained.
 Smith said he and Jones were glad to be able to fill a need although he had originally anticipated students would be making the weekly trips, once the virus restrictions were lifted.
 “I thought this would be a great way to give our students an opportunity to practice all the different things a truck driver needs to do and learn how to do them safely,” Smith said.
 This week, a student driver from the course, Jim Blake of Houtzdale, navigated the trip to Altoona under Smith’s watchful eye. Truck driving is a second career for the man who told The Progress he had been a laborer all his life but following knee surgery found he needed a new career.
 “That’s the reason I took this course through the career center. Everyone told me that the career center’s course was the way to go,” Blake explained. He said he was glad to be able to help with making sure the food was delivered to Clearfield for Saturday’s distribution.

For the past several months, Parker has been one of many Faribault players working to develop an innovative relationship with business owners from Japan, in the hopes of expanding trade and investment in Rice County. This has grown out of existing partnerships that Faribault has already cultivated from international companies, such as Daikin Applied.
 In February 2018, Japanese Consul General Naoki Ito visited Faribault, touring the facilities of Daikin and fellow internationally held company SageGlass. Afterward, he recommended that Faribault’s city officials apply for a newly developed program offered through the Japan Foundation, which allows for local government officials to travel to Japan and meet leaders in business and industry. The goal of the program is to develop relationships and foster economic investment.
 In May 2019, several of Faribault’s city officials traveled to Japan, while Parker was part of a group that went on a second trip to Japan that June. In Japan, Parker and other team members met with business leaders through the Japanese External Trade Organization (JETRO), members of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
 Parker said she was asked to participate in these efforts because of South Central’s strong role in the Faribault community and Rice County region as a whole.
 “[Japan] believes in workforce development and making sure that you’ve got an educated, trained workforce, and I wanted to play that role to make sure that they understand that we have cooperation here in Faribault, and we’d be ready,” she said. “It’s the type of partnership with government, with education and with business that, if they were to invest in Faribault, all of those pieces are there.”
 Following the two trips, Parker was also involved in meetings with the Consulate this February. The meetings revolved around the workforce development needs of Daikin and other companies, along with information about South Central’s apprenticeship and training programs that are offered at Daikin.
 While more work has been done in the past few months, Parker said she hasn’t been as involved, since she was already able to share “her message” and help get the ball rolling.
 “I think we sent a strong message about Minnesota and about Faribault,” she said. “My role was to go and say, ‘We’re together, we’ve got all these pieces, this is what we can do.’ I think we sent that message, and it led to follow-up meetings to Japan. We’re still communicating [with Japan]. I just received a communication from the consulate [recently] inviting us to an event. We’re still on their radar.”

“That was her biggest thing: She served. She served God from a young age until the days she passed away. And she served humanity,” brother and ex-Trenton cop Rolando Ramos said in delivering his sister's eulogy.
 Ramos and cousin Joshua benefited from then-9-year-old Milca's instruction. They entered kindergarten having mastered basics taught to kids in their first year of formal schooling, able to write their names, read simple words and do math.
 “She prepared us that way,” Ramos said. “Every day, we had to play school. It wasn’t just a game for her. It was like a training, a preparation for her life.”
 Hernandez was the eldest of five siblings, 16 years older than the youngest, Ariel, a reverend in Trenton, and an outspoken advocate from the start.
 Her parents, Angel Louis and Miriam, raised the family in the Pentecostal Church Assemblies of God in Trenton, led by the Rev. Joseph Rodriguez Sr.
 Hernandez found a way to challenge conventional wisdom while adhering to the reverence and traditions of the church, a delicate tightrope dance that won over those who came to know her, her brother said.
 Devoted to the church and her craft, Hernandez received her bachelor's degree from Universidad Interamericana de Puerto Rico - Recinto de Arecibo in 1998, moved back to Trenton and began teaching in the school district the same year.
 She spent most of her career at Grace A. Dunn Middle School.
 She also taught Sunday school and later received a ministry certification in 2007. She went on missions — many with youth groups — to some of the poorest, most underprivileged countries in Latin America, even when relatives urged her to cut back on the travel while she dealt with myriad health struggles, including diabetes.
 “You couldn’t keep her from doing her missionary work,” Ramos said.
 During her career as an educator, Hernandez taught some of the district's most intellectually challenged and disabled students, many in self-contained settings where outcomes depend on the steadying forces in the classroom.
 While some teachers shied away from such tough, heart-tugging assignments, Hernandez embraced the challenge and was twice named Teacher of the Year, according to her family.
 “With our kids, seeing the same face every day is important,” said Nicole Whitefield, executive director of the Special Parent Advocacy Group that goes to bat for special education students in the region. “It helps their outcomes. To have someone like her who was dedicated and shows up on an every-day basis, she would be the greatest model for other teachers. She offered something to our students, which is stability.”
 Hernandez returned to school and got her master's in education from Canyon University last year, not long after her brother, a retired Trenton Police lieutenant, received his master's from Seton Hall University.
 “She instilled in me the love of learning,” Ramos said. “I’m always reading. I’m always trying to advance myself.”
 Whenever relatives told her to seek teaching opportunities outside of Trenton, Hernandez slammed the door on the idea, dedicated to the children of the capital city.
 “These are my kids. This is my town,” she'd say.
 Addie Daniels-Lane, a former principal at Hernandez's school and the president of the Trenton Board of Education, said the city educator's death left a “tremendous void” for the community.
 “Words cannot express how deeply saddened I was to learn of her passing. I know from personal experience and observation that she was the kind of teacher that you would want every child to have. She was a very warm, caring, knowledgeable educator who made all of her students feel valued,” Daniels-Lane said. “Ms. Hernandez was firm, yet fair and held high expectations for her students. She was highly respected by her colleagues and deeply appreciated by the parents of her students.

 A common question graduate ask themselves after graduation is 'where to next?' Major cities like San Francisco and New York were once the place to be. Given the current economic situation, Burnes found that cities across the Midwest is a suitable option for beginners.
 "If you are flexible, which I think many graduates are, places like St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Cincinnati or Indianapolis has affordable housing and good starting pay," he said. "The well-paying jobs available in these cities range from software engineers to registered nurses."
 It's believed that the country's economic health can be directly correlated with how the U.S. will recover from the pandemic.
 "A public health response will determine tomorrow's economic recovery," said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at Indeed Hiring lab. "Until COVID is solved and the public health crisis is taken care of only then can we move forward with a fuller economic recovery."
 She recommends graduating seniors revise their resume, strike up a conversation within their professional network and take on development courses on foundational skills like teamwork and communication, in preparation to be ready when the labor market turns around.
 While Cucchiara agrees -- Hodgkin's lymphoma delayed her from interning and finishing her junior hyear on time -- she understands it's no easy task to accept the many challenges 2020 grads face this year.

Now is the time to take a risk or pursue a project you wanted to embark in college but couldn't. Instead of being fearful and believing that there is nothing out there for you, focus on personal achievements."

A black reporter from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was told she could not cover the city’s protests over the death of George Floyd because of a tweet, and now dozens of her colleagues, fellow journalists, her union and even the city’s mayor are speaking out in support of her. On Friday the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh and many of her fellow reporters at the Post- Gazette were demanding that Alexis Johnson be allowed cover the protests, sending identical versions of the tweet themselves and using the hashtag #IStandWithAlexis. On Sunday, Johnson posted four photos that show trashed public spaces in the aftermath of a crowd. “Horrifying scenes and aftermath from selfish LOOTERS who don’t care about this city!!!!!” the tweet’s text says. “.... oh wait sorry. “No, these are pictures from a Kenny Chesney concert tailgate. Whoops.” It has since been retweeted nearly 50,000 times. Johnson confirmed to The Associated Press on Friday that she was told the tweet and the apparent bias it showed were the reasons she would no longer be covering the protests. She declined further comment, deferring to her guild. Guild President Michael A. Fuoco, who is also a Post-Gazette reporter, told the AP that guild leaders were “appalled” by the move, and the paper’s editors have not yielded at all in discussions about Johnson’s status. “We feel taking a black woman off the most monumental national story about civil rights in the last 50 years is punishment,” Fuoco said. “We have very few black journalists. Someone who has the contacts and the insights for this story, that is what you want.” He said of the tweet that he “thought it was clever, I thought it was funny, and I thought it was food for thought.

 “What I was told is this is the last option to fix the foot for good,” Tuliaupupu said. “There’s always the risk it won’t work. But as of right now, I feel great. I feel amazing. If I hurt my foot again, yeah, my career will probably be over. But I don’t think about that.”
 He still thinks about the moment it happened in November 2017. How Mission Viejo was driving against Mater Dei in the state semifinals. How the running back swung into the flat and caught a checkdown pass. How he planted to break on the ball. And how, instantly, it felt as if his foot split in half.
 Nonetheless, he couldn’t believe when doctors told him he needed surgery. Or that his recovery could last as long as a year. He chuckles now, thinking of how much longer that path back actually took.

Throughout my listening, I was continually impressed with the way the cartridge rendered the sounds of stringed instruments, woodwinds, brass, and percussion.

“I feel that the counsel provided to me was insufficient,” Snyder said when he had the opportunity to address the court. “I said not guilty, and then I was overrode on my own case, the plea of not guilty by mental illness was put in place, and there was no doctor provided to testify on my behalf.”
 Snyder told the court he was not satisf ied with Foreman’s representation, and as such was represented during the sentencing hearing by co-counsel Charles MacDonald. MacDonald argued the jury did not have a complete picture of Snyder’s mental health issues, and that Snyder’s lack of criminal history suggested he was unlikely to commit such a serious crime.
 “I think the state is pounding more than what was there,” MacDonald said. “It was a trivial motivation that would cause Jamie to commit this act. I’m not saying he’s a raving lunatic, but it is the sort of thing that could tip the scales in action, and that is much more significant than what has been addressed.”
 But Korell said Snyder’s mental health had been taken into consideration during the proceedings, and that his issues weren’t serious enough to mount a defense.
 “You chose to take matters into your own hands and make a final decision for somebody else,” Korell said. “ Once that knife plunged into his chest, there was no turning back. You attempted to cover up by hiding and ditching clothing.”

A local social justice group is holding a demonstration in solidarity with other protests that have taken place across the globe in the wake of George Floyd's death last week.
 The event, called the Demonstration of Solidarity for Racial Justice, will take place at 2 p.m. Saturday at the New York State Equal Rights Heritage Center in downtown Auburn. The demonstration is being held by the Social Justice Task Force, an independent coalition of various social justice groups, entrepreneurs, organizations and activists within Cayuga County.
 Event attendees are asked to wear face masks and practice social distancing in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed last week by a Minneapolis police officer, protests have arisen across the U.S. and the world decrying police brutality and systemic racism.
