Training will do you no good if it happens once in a blue moon. Your talent will only grow if you keep at it constantly. Since this is difficult for many people, consider making a schedule for your training process. It’s harder to avoid working when you have it written down. Keep in mind that you should be varying exercises from day to day. While basic workouts should be completed daily, try not to focus on the same goal for an entire week. Your muscles will get tired and you may hurt yourself, particularly if you’re focusing on cardio.

Am găsit, între documente, şi declaraţia lui Ciule Gavril, din „Sat Stâna nr. 138, născut la 1913.27.XII”, cel care i-a ajutat pe români să treacă, neobservaţi, Meseşul. În toamna anului 1944 se afla acasă, întors de pe front. Este convocat de primar la „casa satului”, pentru a fi trimis la săpat tranşee. În condiţiile în care frontul se apropia, ştiind acest lucru, a fugit în pădure, împreună cu un nepot al său, Opriş Victor. Nu s-a oprit acolo unde erau ascunşi alţi mulţi locuitori din sat, inclusiv „toate rudele Primarului zis Chiaburul”, ci a trecut mai departe, sub tirul unor „avioane nemţeşti zise ştiuca” (bombardiere în picaj, Junkers Ju 87 sau Stuka, n.n) , ajungând la locul denumit „sub piatră”. Acolo s-a întâlnit cu Opriş Traian, „care este în momental preot în Zalau”. A rămas în pădure până ce frontul s-a apropiat şi s-a retras la casa lui Opriş Gavril. Acolo, seara, pe la orele 21,00 apare un soldat român. L-au chemat în casă, i-au dat să mânânce şi l-au însoţit apoi până la comandatul lui. Acesta le-a cerut să-i ajute să trecă Meseşul: „să ne conduci până la gară la Zalău, dar aici, peste pădurile astea”. „Me-am dat seama că ce am de făcut şi tocmai atunci bătea cu catiuşa sovietică de pe şoseaua Cluj de pe lângă Popasul Romanilor”. După ce îi conduce cu bine la gara din Zalău, trecând pe la spitalul vechi, „ca să putem cerceta dacă cumva este armata fascistă pe acolo şi aşa am reuşit de nu era”, vede vagoanele arzând, şi fără să mai zică „cătră nime nimic m-am luat şi am venit acasă”. _(Ciule Gavril, „Declaraţie”, 25 februarie 1976)_

If there is such a thing as a 76-year-old poster child, Collin Peterson, the chairman of the House Ag Committee, could be the weatherworn face of today’s red-and-blue political divide in rural America. His qualifications for the job are, well, colorful.


  For example, he’s a 15-term, incumbent Democrat in a rural Minnesota congressional district that favored Donald J. Trump over Hillary Clinton by 31 points in 2016.


  Equally upside down, Peterson is the only Democrat in Congress with an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association, “the only pro-life Democrat” in the House, and a founding member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of tightwad House Dems whose professional hobby is to vote “No” on federal spending bills.


  (He’s not the only Blue Dog on the farm, though; five of the other 25 Dems on the House Ag Committee run in Peterson’s flinty pack.)


  Blue Peterson sports two other characteristics common to his mostly rural- and-red district. First, he’s voted 47% of the time with President Donald J. Trump and House Republicans, a remarkable feat of fence sitting for a Democratic committee chairman.


  Secondly, he is the political embodiment of rural America’s strong embrace of anti-government government: the idea that wave after growing wave of federal spending needs to be reined in unless, of course, it’s floating my boat, farm or congressional committee.


  In Peterson’s case, he has served as either the ranking minority member or chair of the House Ag Committee as it — with the help of big spending edicts from the Trump White House — has doled out nearly $100 billion in ag subsidies to U.S. farmers and ranchers in just the last four years.


  Be that some form of a new federalism or simply plain old socialism, $100 billion in “Federal Government direct farm program payments,” as the U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it, in just four years is a record.


  But it’s also an enormous flag to alert agriculture and Congress that something is very wrong with federally subsidized revenue insurance, the centerpiece of U.S. farm policy. Its focus on production, not price, underwrites yesterday’s ever-lower prices, and also undermines today’s faltering rural resiliency.

Carlo Ancelotti says Everton will get a true measure of their improvement when the surprise Premier League leaders face champions Liverpool on Saturday.


  Ancelotti's side have reeled off four successive wins in a perfect start to the season.


  But the Everton manager knows this weekend's Merseyside derby at Goodison Park will provide the acid test of their resurgence.


  Everton have not beaten Liverpool since 2010 and finished 50 points behind Jurgen Klopp's men last term.


  Liverpool suffering a humiliating 7-2 thrashing by Aston Villa just before the international break, a result that emphasised some flaws in the Reds' defence.


  Despite that shocking loss and some other defensive blunders this season, Liverpool still represent the gold standard in Ancelotti's eyes.


  "I think it will be good for us to have this kind of test. They are the best, they were the best last season and one of the best teams in the world, so it's a fantastic challenge," Ancelotti told reporters on Friday.


  "The message for us is they are going to have an exciting game, it's a derby. Be confident and be happy to play this game.


  "I think the feeling in the dressing room is good. We've started really well, we know it will be a fantastic challenge."


  Everton are three points above Liverpool and for once have the upper hand going into the derby, leaving fans dreaming of the period in the 1980s when the local rivals slugged it out for the title on a regular basis.


  Klopp is a long-standing admirer of Ancelotti after his success with Chelsea, AC Milan, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.


  And the German believes Everton are capable of sustaining their early-season success long enough to emerge as title contenders.


  "I want to say thanks to him, to be a challenger for Liverpool could be really good for us," Ancelotti said of Klopp's compliment.


  "Of course Liverpool is doing so well. We are, I think, not so far but still far from them. We can have a good test tomorrow against them to see how far we are."

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.    2. On a lightly floured work surface, spread out pie crust. (For homemade crusts, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle.) Fit the dough circle into a 9-inch pie plate, trim the edges, and crimp as desired. Using a fork, prick crust all over, then chill for 30 minutes.   3. Line crust with a sheet of parchment paper and fill the pie dish with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until crust begins to turn brown at the edge, about 15 minutes.    4. While crust is in the oven, in a medium bowl, whisk sugar and flour together, then stir in the half-and-half, cream, and vanilla.   5. Remove crust from oven, transfer the pie dish to a rack, and remove the paper and weights. Pour the filling into the pie crust, and bake until the filling is lightly set but jiggles when tapped on the side, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.   6. Transfer the pie to a rack and let cool completely.    7. Grate nutmeg over the top just before serving.

Smiles] I agree. I think a Cabinet is supposed to be diverse, it's supposed to have a representation of not just the tribes but the geographical differences that we have in this country. The diversity in us is not bad. Sometimes people think promoting this tribe is bad, it's not. We all come from different tribes and regions and our background matters. If we appreciate diversity and use it to our advantage then it is good. But if we want to bring division because we belong to different tribes, that's where the problem is. For a long time, I think Barrow has done the right thing to ensure you have all sides in Cabinet. I mean, it's the reality; people look at that and they talk about it. If you don't involve tribes or have a government dominated by one tribe, there tends to be some issues that will rise and we've seen those things happen here. When people feel isolated, they take a back seat and then you create trouble. It's not just about me, I think any other person who was included in the government who is from Jolas, or whatever, it would have been a good way to do it. That's how I believe government should be run.

Coronavirus cases are rising rapidly in many states as the U.S. heads into the winter months. And forecasters predict staggering growth in infections and deaths if current trends continue.


  It's exactly the kind of scenario that public health experts have long warned could be in store for the country, if it did not aggressively tamp down on infections over the summer.


  "We were really hoping to crater the cases in preparation for a bad winter," says Tara Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University. "We've done basically the opposite."


  After hitting an all-time high in July, cases did drop significantly, but the U.S. never reached a level where the public health system could truly get a handle on the outbreak.


  Now infections are on the rise again.


  The U.S. is averaging more than 52,000 new cases a day (the highest it's been since mid-August), driven by ballooning outbreaks across the country's interior, especially in the Midwest, the Great Plains and the West


  Contributing to this rise is the return of students to campus, resistance to mandates on social distancing and mask wearing, and more people spending time in restaurants and other indoor settings, Smith says.

Although I have never seen pollinators on the flowers, they are fragrant and brightly colored, so I assume they are trying to attract something. The only source for information I have found on this comes from Bernd Heinrich in a 1987 Scientific American article. He witnessed the night-flying owlet moth feeding on the nectar and pollinating the flowers in November when most other insects are no longer around.
 Of the garden flowers blooming now, you must have seen big, bold New England asters and perhaps some of the more shy wild woodland asters. Some of my phlox are still blooming, as are some black-eyed Susans. Of those, a Rudbeckia called ‘Henry Eiler’ is the most dramatic. Over five feet tall, it will bloom all month in a huge clump. I just wish I didn’t have to tie it up to keep it from flopping.
 I have an absolutely stunning goldenrod (Soldiago rugosa), a cultivar called “Fireworks.” It is one I purchased several years ago and it is now a nice tight clump 4 feet across and 3 feet tall. The blossoms arch over gently, and point in different directions, creating a stunning display, a little like the finale of a good fireworks display. Unlike wild goldenrod, it does not seem to spread quickly by root or seed.
 Also in bloom for me now is Knautia macedonia with deep wine-red flowers reminiscent of Scabiosa or pincushion flower. It has been blooming for months, and is a delight. The stems are thin and tend to bend over a bit when blooming, but the blossoms never seem to fall to the ground. It is not a good cut flower, but earns its place in the garden because if its long bloom time.
 Most species of monkshood bloom in June, but I also have one species, Aconitum carmichaelii, which blooms now with intense blue flowers on 5-foot stems that do not flop. All monkshood species have poisonous sap, and some were said to be used to poison wolves in Russia. Agatha Christie probably had someone use it for tea, to get rid of an annoying relative, but I don’t recommend that.
 I have always tried to expand the growing season here in my cold Zone 4 garden. I should have a few blossoms into November, and then there will be a hiatus until early March when my first snowdrops bloom. But I can buy flowers for my table in winter, and I do have plenty of houseplants.

Cambridgeshire Police said that in his interview Norton claimed he must have fallen asleep at the wheel, and offered this as the only explanation as to why he swerved into the other carriageway.


  Mr Farmer told the court in the immediate aftermath of the crash, Norton got out and helped Lexi out of the car, when she asked a member of the public "is my dad still alive, please let my mum be alive".


  In a victim impact statement by Mrs Bateman's mother Angela Harper, which was read out in court, she said her daughter was "loved by all" and a "wonderful, caring and supportive person".


  When the pandemic hit, she said she saw the family-of-four five times since lockdown had eased, with the last time being six days before the couple died.


  She described how Lexi "sat next to her dead father and watched her mother die" while still having compassion to look after her younger sister.


  "Elizabeth will have no memories of her amazing parents, no knowledge of how fantastic they were and how lucky she was," Ms Harper said.


  The couple had celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary nearly two weeks before the collision, on August 20, the court heard.


  As he handed Norton an eight year and eight month jail term, Judge Sean Enright said: "You deprived two children of their parents."

Giovanna Fletcher - author, host and mother of three - is the definition of a woman spinning multiple plates, but when I manage to pin her down for a quick catch up (in between filming and the school run) she's the definition of cool, calm and candid. For any listeners of Gi's, as she's known to friends, podcast, _Happy Mum, Happy Baby_ (which has even featured Kate Middleton as a guest), you'll be pleased to know she's just as personable off-air as she is during episodes too.
 Her honesty about all things parenting, mental health and everything in between, infused with a dose of sunshine, has helped her to win over a legion of fans - many of whom will be tuning into her virtual event, Happy Mum Happy Baby: The Virtual Meetup (15 - 18th October), over the next few days. But it hasn't always been plain sailing, Gi admits.
 Like many, she's experienced self-doubt over her parenting ability and worried that others are judging her. "I remember early on with Buzz [now 6, who she shares with McFly's Tom Fletcher] being in a restaurant and thinking these two people on a nearby table were really judging me," she shares. "But about half an hour into the meal, they turned around and we got chatting and they were really lovely. So what my mind had been _telling_ me was going on, wasn't _actually_ happening." The experience, she says, taught her that changing her own outlook could have a hugely positive impact. "Most people are just going about their day, they aren't judging you."

Lee Plaza is a domestic worker and an organizer with the Pilipino Worker Center. She has just come out of quarantine having been exposed to an outbreak in the senior center where she worked. She says as a result of several of a deadly covid outbreak, she has been given the proper PPE but many who she works with and represents are still going face to face with the novel coronavirus without the basic protections that are crucial for their very survival. “I was exposed to Covid because I was assigned by my homecare agency in a facility that was exposed to Covid having six deaths in the month of March when we had our lockdown,” she told me. “ So I had to quarantine myself because I feared for my life, especially that I'm already a vulnerable caregiver since I'm already 60,” she said. And she quickly added that her situation is definitely not unique. “So I have a lot of co-caregivers who also tested positive, and there are three in our center, in our worker center, who died of Covid. And so it is really very heartbreaking that we are exposed to this global health crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. And it's difficult because you are very insecure to work. Like now I have to go back to work; otherwise as a caregiver we are not given protective day labor laws. Here we have no work/no pay and we don't have health and safety protections as we work. But we have no choice because we need to work in order to survive. Like it's a survival of the fittest."

Red Oak) -- KMA News continues its "Meet the Candidates" series, featuring the candidate running in key races in the November 3rd general election. Today, we turn our attention to the race for Montgomery County's 3rd district supervisor's seat, with a report on the nonaffiliated incumbent candidate, Bryant Amos.


  A familiar face in Montgomery County government, Amos is running for a fifth term as supervisor, Amos owned a beer distributorship for about 20 years, then served as a shift manager for 12 years at Parker Hannifin until retiring four years ago. In addition to serving as a Red Oak volunteer firefighter for 17 years, Amos served stints on the Red Oak City Council and school board before his election as a supervisor 16 years ago. Amos lost to challenger Randy Cooper in the June Republican primary. However, he set a rematch with Cooper by taking advantage of a change in election laws. Speaking on KMA's "Morning Line" program Friday morning, Amos says he circulated nomination papers to run as a Republican in June AND as a nonpartisan candidate on the November ballot.


  "Being in the office for so long, I knew it would be a close race," said Amos. "I wanted to already have that done, and I had the decision in August whether to remain on the ballot, or pull it. I had so much encouragement from other people, and thanks for me staying in the race, that I decided to stay on the ballot as a nonpartisan."

Primarily, I think the reason why I lost was because I decided to go independent. Gambians by our nature vote based on not what you present but who you represent and who you are. Things were tough, the coalition government just came into power and UDP had the upper hand in terms of support base then. The second reason was, and which came out, that I was Jola and people were like 'Jola ahh, Jolayaa kanyangtaleh. So I had multiple reasons but my reasons are manifested; that if you are representing a party as a mayor you have to do their bidding, if you don't do their bidding you will be kicked out and we've seen the Sheriffo Sonko issue how it panned out in the end and all of the chairmen would have to fall in line otherwise they can't do much. That's one of the reasons. I also feared that the Council will be politicised. I did say this after the mayoral election; IEC also played a role, that's not the reason why I lost but it's one of the reasons why the results went the way they are. There were lots of things that were happening; registration of voter's cards, even in the night of elections, IEC was still registering voter's cards at the Kanifing office. During elections some people were handed over voter's cards. I had ballot boxes in Ebo Town, Jeshwang and Bundung and people were not able to put their marbles through. Joe Colley said at the time those were challenges they have. He said entry points were a bit tight.

Fascism and Nazism arose only after a serious threat of Communist Revolution obtained. Where Communists were crushed completely, there was no scope for crazy nutters like Dimitrios Ioannidis to run amok. This is not to say that Greek foreign policy has ever been quite rational- but the same could be said of other small but very ancient nations. It is not the case that Greece had a noxious caste systems such that 'untouchables' were bound to turn into Fascists while well educated patricians would gravitate to Marxism.      The problem that faced Greece was that some on the Left equated NATO and then the EU with Nazism and Fascism and evil capitalist bastards determined to starve Greek babies while heaping all sorts of humiliations upon the country. Oddly, the Left believed 'free money' would be available for obstreperousness of this puerile sort. Why? Maybe too many of them were academics of a Trustafarian sort. Or perhaps they were just personally ambitious and didn't care what happened to the Greek economy.      It seems the Greek people have come together under conditions of adversity. They are determined to raise themselves up by their own hard work and in accordance with the principles of Political Economy first enunciated over two thousand years ago in their own homeland. Golden Dawn has been investigated and it has been judged as nothing but a criminal organization. It may be that there are 'bad apples' in the police and paramilitary just as there may still be some corrupt people in the Tax Department and so forth. Greece will purge or re-educate such elements. It won't refight the Civil War- a catastrophe for which Superpower politics must bear much of the blame. Neither an Ionannidis in military matters, nor a Varoufakis in Finance, will be permitted to damage a great and noble Nation.
