When Thomas died in 1870, his funeral attracted 10,000 visitors to Troy, including President Ulysses S. Grant, five cabinet members, General William Tecumseh Sherman, and Ohio Congressman James Garfield. It still holds the record for the largest funeral ever at Oakwood Cemetery.
 “It is our pleasure to support Oakwood Cemetery. It is such a hidden gem in Rensselaer County,” said Sue Hayes, owner of Inch By Inch Organic Gardens in Troy. “The Daffodil Tea & Garden Stroll is a fun and informative way to experience history. We at Inch By Inch Organic Gardens have the privilege, during this important election year, of showcasing the gravesite of Caroline Gilkey Rogers.
 "Without her, women may not have the right to vote. A true suffragette that spent many a year voicing the logical reasons for all women to vote. We are creating a space of beauty at her grave to showcase her hard-fought battle in the colors of the flag flown to honor the passage of the 19th Amendment on its 100 anniversary.”
 While the Daffodil Brunch typically sold out its two seatings each year, organizers hope that the new fundraiser concept will allow more guests to be involved with the event.
 Along with engaging the public, the event’s goal is to support the cemetery. Funds raised will help support the cemetery’s flag program for military veterans, as well as gravestone maintenance and grounds upkeep.
 “We have a responsibility to everyone who is buried there to continue to care for the cemetery,” Stryker said.
 All are invited to be among the first to experience this brand new spring event, which will take place rain or shine.
 Admission is $15 per person or free for children younger than 12.
 Attendees are required to prepay, and reservations can be made by calling Oakwood Cemetery at 518-328-0090.
 The Daffodil Tea and Garden Stroll will also serve as the kickoff to Oakwood Cemetery’s tour season, which is scheduled to include a Family Mausoleums Tour, a Casualties of the Civil War Tour, a Centennial Women's Suffrage Tour, an Edgar Allan Poe Tour and more.
 More information about Oakwood Cemetery and its upcoming events is available online at www.facebook.com/oakwoodcemetery.org.

 The majority of people who have the new coronavirus, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, will get better without any long-term effects, according to an Oregon doctor.
  About 80% of cases tend to be mild. In these cases, symptoms diminish over five to seven days, although people are still capable of transmitting the disease. But there are many people with a higher risk of having a more severe disease if they are diagnosed with coronavirus, including those with heart disease, diabetes, asthma and other vascular disease problems. Also, most children who get it have mild symptoms.

As naive as it may seem, you may get better results by promoting academic integrity than by trying to stop cheating. You can find out more information about this approach on websites developed by MIT and UCSD, among others. Perhaps the most that you, as an instructor, can do under the present pressures is to present students with a strong argument for the benefits of maintaining their integrity, while developing minimally cheat-proof assignments. Other points you might touch on include: when you cheat, you circumvent an opportunity to solidify your learning. While this may benefit you in the short run, it will catch up with you eventually; once you have engaged in cheating, you will likely enter your next course unprepared and this will lead to the likelihood of further cheating in the future; the stress and anxiety that come from cheating on a test will almost certainly outweigh the stress of preparing to the best of your ability. Moreover, the stress and anxiety that come from cheating remain with you after you take the exam. Nearly all people who have cheated on a test remember having done so for the rest of their lives.

Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum.

So I began to wonder about the impact such transitions will have on students and colleagues emotionally, psychologically and even physically. The current situation hits close to home for me. During the 1991 Operation Desert Storm, I was a student in middle school in Baghdad. When the bombing started, schools shut down abruptly. We didn't have internet or the ability to attend school virtually. One morning, one of my teachers showed up at my house, hand- delivered homework and reminded me to keep studying. To this day, I remember how her dedication and acts of resilience and hope helped me feel a tiny sense of normalcy during that turbulent time in my life. At night, I would sit by the candlelight to study and dream of going back to school and all the conversations I would have with my friends.

But it said Israelis could still go to work - many businesses are operating with reduced staff to try to halt the virus's spread - shop for food and medicine, exercise outdoors and walk their dogs.
 "Even when leaving the house for these purposes, contact between people should be limited and they should stay two metres apart," the ministry said.
 It was not immediately clear if police would be enforcing the tightened restrictions.
 The use of anti-terrorism technology to track infected people and anyone with whom they have come in contact drew criticism from civil rights groups when Netanyahu first proposed it over the weekend.
 Israeli authorities said the cyber monitoring, in effect for the next two weeks, was aimed only at halting the spread of coronavirus and would ultimately be deleted.
 But The Association for Civil Right in Israel called the move "a dangerous precedent and a slippery slope".
 Gabi Ashkenazi, a senior member of the centrist Blue and White Party, also criticised the use of emergency orders.
 "It's inappropriate to approve such a measure in this manner, without public and parliamentary supervision," he wrote on Twitter.
 His party leader, former general Benny Gantz, could be the next prime minister after he was tapped by Israel's president on Monday to try to form a new government following a March 2 election, the third within a year
 However Justice Minister Amir Ohana dismissed the criticism.
 "The concerns of those disturbed by cyber monitoring are outweighed by the threat we are facing," he said on Israel Radio.
 There are 324 confirmed coronavirus cases in Israel. In the Palestinian territories, 41 have been confirmed in the occupied West Bank, with none in the Gaza Strip.

PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona opened election polls Tuesday for Democrats to pick a presidential candidate as the state deals with a public health crisis that has crippled parts of the nation. The state's top election official declined to seek a delay because of the coronavirus, saying Monday that there was no certainty that putting off voting would help. “We have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the future,” Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said during a news conference in Phoenix alongside Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and other state officials. Hobbs said after the public votes, an army of election workers will have to process ballots in warehouses, an undertaking that could get more dangerous as time passes. The Democratic ballot will contain 18 names, but the race boils down to a face-off between Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. More than a dozen other candidates dropped out, but still appear on the ballot. Polls opened at 6 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. The vast majority of the 1.2 million registered Arizona Democrats cast ballots early by mail, but about 300,000 can vote in person Tuesday. Melissa Cox, 42, dropped off her absentee ballot at an empty emergency polling place in South Phoenix on Monday. She said she's concerned about the coronavirus outbreak but was mainly trying to avoid potential lines and crowds on Tuesday. “I'm trying to not be panicked,” said Cox, an admissions counselor for a vocational school who voted for Biden. Around the state Monday, election officials consolidated polling places, lined up backup poll workers and opened emergency voting centers where people can cast a ballot early as parts of the state shut down to avoid spreading the new virus.

Here's the thing. While I understand why Duke picked up the simulated win, the Blue Devils were looking a little vulnerable in the final month of the season with losses to N.C. State, Wake Forest and Virginia. Illinois might have been in upset territory. Regardless, the big man matchup between Kofi Cockburn and Vernon Carey Jr. would have been great.
 — For the rest of the bracket, upsets were in short supply. There were just four in the first round, and since two of those were 8/9 games they really don't count. That's not an upset when No. 8 seeds win essentially 51 percent of the time.
 — Best defensive matchup of the first round was West Virginia vs. Rutgers. Might have been a "First to 50 wins" situation with the Nos. 3 and 6, respectively, most efficient defenses in the country squaring off.
 — My favorite first round matchup might have been Michigan-Utah State. The Wolverines won in the SportsLine simulation, but the combination of a healthy Neemias Queta to go with a red hot Sam Merill could have put the Aggies over the top for the upset in the 7-10 game.
 — Let's skip ahead to the Elite Eight, which had some big time games. As it should be. We're talking Kansas-Duke and Dayton-Michigan State on one half of the bracket and Gonzaga-San Diego State and Baylor-Florida State on the other. Name brand program wise that might not be all the top dogs, but basketball in 2020 wise it's pretty great. (Also, this might have been a bad idea because I'm missing the NCAA tournament hard).
 — Fast forward once more to the title game. Dayton vs. Gonzaga. What everybody drew up before the season started, right? The Flyers take the title in the SportsLine simulation, and I only assume that meant Obi Toppin went off for something like 35 points, 13 rebounds and three just wild dunks. Oh, what could have been.

It seems like our whole world has been canceled in the past week. Coronavirus has changed our daily lives from school cancelations to large events being postponed or canceled.
 Yes, the word “canceled” is all over the place, but we’re (rightly so) more concerned about making sure we all stay safe and healthy. As we all adjust to a radically different world than the one we lived in a week ago, I’m going to focus for a minute on British and American English spellings. By doing so, we can know the correct way to spell “canceled” in the U.S.
 Why are so many British and American English words spelled differently? Look no further than the All-American boy Noah Webster, Jr. In addition to being buddies with Alexander Hamilton, serving in the Connecticut House of Representatives and being a fascinating character, Webster was a lexicographer, which is a fancy way of saying “word nerd.” In 1806 he published his first dictionary, called A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language.

UEFA has proposed postponing this year's European Championship until 2021, a source close to European football's governing body told AFP on Tuesday, as the continent battles with the coronavirus pandemic.
 The source's confirmation of the proposal came after the Norwegian FA tweeted that the new plan is for the tournament to take place from June 11 to July 11 next year, turning Euro 2020 into Euro 2021.
 The proposal was made as UEFA held crisis talks with its national associations as well as clubs and players bodies via videoconference on Tuesday. The proposal is likely to be ratified at a UEFA Executive Committee meeting in the afternoon.
 The move comes with most of Europe's domestic leagues having ground to a halt over the last week as football confronts its biggest issue in modern times.
 The UEFA Champions League and Europa League competitions for clubs have also been suspended, with both still in the last-16 stage, but postponing the European Championship for national sides means they, along with national leagues, will have the chance to be completed, assuming travel restrictions are lifted in time.
 Europe has become the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, with France on Tuesday having joined Italy and Spain in applying strict lockdown measures and European leaders also planning to ban all non-essential travel into the continent.
 More than 2,100 people have died in Italy, which was supposed to host the opening game of Euro 2020 in Rome. The head of the Italian football federation, Gabriele Gravina, had already led calls for the Euros to be postponed.
 Euro 2020 was due to be held in 12 different cities across the continent, from as far apart as Dublin and Bilbao, to Saint Petersburg and Baku.
 The semi-finals and final were due to be played in London and there would considerable knock-on effects to postponing the competition -- the women's European Championship is scheduled to run from July 7 to August 1 next year in England, with the final at Wembley.
 UEFA have also planned to stage an Under-21 Euros in Hungary and Slovenia in June next year.
 Twenty of the 24 teams set to take part in the Euro have already qualified, but play-offs to determine the final four participants, due to be played later this month, will have to take place at a later date.
 \- Collision course with FIFA? -
 Moving the Euro by a year also puts UEFA on a collision course with football's world governing body FIFA, whose president Gianni Infantino has planned to stage the inaugural edition of his highly lucrative Club World Cup in June and July next year in China. Some of Europe's top club sides are expected to be involved.
 "FIFA will keep in regular contact with all relevant stakeholders during this difficult period and look to find in due course solutions in a spirit of cooperation, taking into account the interests of football at all levels," Infantino wrote in an open letter on Monday.
 "Health first and sporting solidarity should be the key principles guiding decision-making at this important moment in time and I am sure that the whole football community will live up to the great values of our sport."
 \- 'Final Four' proposal -
 As for its flagship club competitions, UEFA may come to a decision to try to complete the Champions League and Europa League by curtailing the competitions, meaning ties up to the semi-finals could be decided in one-off matches.
 Reports on Tuesday also indicated both tournaments could conclude with a 'Final Four' meeting in the scheduled host cities -- Istanbul for the Champions League and Gdansk in Poland for the Europa League, meaning the two- legged semi-finals would be removed.
 Financially, UEFA will undoubtedly prefer postponements to outright cancellations, or playing matches behind closed doors, even if it is impossible at this stage to know when club football can resume.
 The last European Championship, held in France in 2016, generated total revenue of close to two billion euros ($2.2 billion) for UEFA.
 "The financial stakes are enormous," according to one senior figure in the international game. "We know that FIFA has significant reserves but we don't know about UEFA or the different leagues."

Net revenues for the fourth quarter at Lands’ End, Inc. increased 9.4 percent to 549.5 million dollars reflecting revenue from the American Airlines launch and ecommerce growth of 7.2 percent. The company said, this was partially offset by 49 fewer Lands’ End Shops at Sears, which resulted in a net revenue decline from Sears operations of 21.5 million dollars. U.S. ecommerce revenue growth of 7.4 percent, the company added, was driven by increased demand for key items and a growth in new customer acquisition. Gross margin for the quarter increased by approximately 90 basis points to 39.8 percent, while net income was 25.5 million dollars or 78 cents per diluted share compared to 16.2 million dollars or 50 cents per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
