Costume designer Avery Plewes, who worked on “The Craft: Legacy,” ranks Head- designed movies “Sweet Charity” and “What a Way to Go!” as some of her all- time favorites for costumes. “There is an irreverence with her use of color that you rarely see,” says Plewes, “There is a fearlessness that I learned from her films. I often question whether my ideas go too far, and her work taught me to always try the crazy idea. Sometimes the craziest idea turns out to be the best idea. Her costumes in both films have purpose and function while being fabulous and outlandish all at the same time, which isn't always an easy feat.”

My research indicates that Trump's appeals may spark an unintended countermobilization. Half of African Americans in the U.S. live in the suburbs. These voters, typically of higher socioeconomic status when compared with their white neighbors, are more likely to mobilize others who - in the face of Trump's unsubtle racist signals - may now be motivated to vote for Democrats, particularly in races lower down on the ballot.

Roma, 28 ott. (askanews) - "Ci era stato detto che i Dpcm sarebbero passati dal Parlamento. Quello che sta accadendo è che ci sono stati tre Dpcm nell'arco di 12 giorni con cui il governo dice che il decreto precedente era inutile, cioè che si procede a tentoni. Non abbiamo mai votato, vogliamo che vengano in Aula e votare quello su cui non siamo d'accordo e vogliamo che la maggioranza ci metta la faccia". Lo dice Giorgia Meloni, leader di Fratelli d'Italia, parlando al presidio parlamentare permanente allestito a piazza Capranica, nei pressi di Montecitorio, per ascoltare le categorie colpite dagli ultimi Dpcm.

Anyway, when we met I brought some photos of her as a blonde, and she told me that she had also thought of that. It was pretty amazing that we were on the same page. We both had this idea not just that she should be blonde, but a blatantly fake blonde. We though this would help underline that to succeed in the world of contemporary art you have to be very cold and strategic, and fake. Monica knows the art world very well. She talked to me about women she knew in this milieu. Gallerists, marketing people. We both drew from that.

The Electoral Commission has today published financial accounts for major political party income and expenditure in the year ending 31 December 2019. The biggest spenders, naturally, were the Labour Party, who managed to squeak to the end of the year in the black despite spending £57 million. The Tories, by contrast, spent just 54,908,000, although netted £13 in the bank which stood them in much better stead to weather the Coronavirus storm. _Fiscal prudence begins at home …_

One such player was defensive end Julius Peppers. For years, Peppers was a terror off the edge, first with the Carolina Panthers, then with the Chicago Bears and finally, to add insult to injury, the Green Bay Packers. The Lions never had an answer for Peppers up front on the field either before or after he joined the division, and often he ran amok against the team to the tune of 16 career sacks, 8 forced fumbles and 3 fumble recoveries. It was the second highest total for any team Peppers ever played.

Until mass SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, social distancing and use of face coverings, with comprehensive case finding, testing, tracing and isolation, are the safest approach. These tried-and-true public health measures will keep viral transmission low enough for people to work and attend school while managing smaller outbreaks as they arise. It isn't a return to a totally normal life, but these approaches can balance social and economic needs with health. And then, once a vaccine is widely available, the country can move to herd immunity.
