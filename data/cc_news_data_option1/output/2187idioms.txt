The said that though police were deployed at quarantine centres and ensuring enforcement of Covid-19 standard operation procedures across the district, they also launched a crackdown against outlaws and achieved a record success during last month. The added that during the crackdown against narcotics peddlers, charas, heroin and liquor were also seized and dozens of peddlers put behind bars. “The police also arrested 14 outlaws wanted in heinous crimes since long and seized arms and ammunition from their possession,” said an official. The police also seized dozens of motorbikes in cases of underage driving and the parents were summoned to police stations.

The Covid-19 pandemic may have an explosive rebound in Canada if safety precautions and public restrictions are lifted too early, the country's seniormost medical officer has warned, even as concerns rise that recent protests could complicate the process of recovery from the virus.The alarm was sounded by Canada's chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam even as fresh data points towards the coronavirus crisis waning in the country. During a regular media briefing, Tam said, "If we relax too much or too soon, the epidemic will most likely rebound with explosive growth as a distinct possibility." She also released the latest modelling for the spread of the disease in Canada, projecting that the number of deaths could range between 7,700 to 9,400 by June 15, while total cases may be between 97,990 and 107,454. As of Thursday night, the country recorded 7637 fatalities and 93711 infections.That relatively positive projection was welcomed by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during his daily briefing, as he said, "That's an encouraging sign that the virus is slowing and, in some places, even stopping." However, he was quick to echo Tam's concerns, as he added, "But I want to be very clear. We're not out of the woods. The pandemic is still threatening the health and safety of Canadians."Clearly, Canadian Government officials are worried that ongoing protests over the police killing of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis could have an adverse impact of controlling the spread of Covid-19. Canada has also witnessed similar protests in the cities of Toronto and Montreal, which account for the majority of cases in the nation.Among those who have voiced their concern is Canada's Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. "The coronavirus issue is a really serious one to think about in that context," she said, according to the outlet Global News.Dr Tam had earlier also tweeted her concerns over the protests. "When it comes to peaceful protest during #COVID19, virtual protest is the safest bet. First consider the risks to yourself, your family & community," she posted. In a follow-up, she noted that if protestors did gather, it was necessary they follow social distancing norms and wear masks. Finally, she asked them to use signs at the protests, if people had to collect physically, instead of yelling slogans. She tweeted, "Even with layers of protection, speaking loudly, shouting & singing can increase projection of infectious droplets. To safe protest during #COVID19, let your sign do the talking, your phone do the singing & wear a mask."

Hard problems require tough solutions, and in the case of decades of tension between minority communities and police departments, the remedy requires all of us to acknowledge that the problem is more pervasive than the transgressions of a few bad apples.
   
 The bad apples narrative, while true in specific incidents, doesn't allow for the necessary introspection that propels broader reform.
   
 Just to be clear, police officers have one of the toughest jobs, and those who do their jobs with respect and dignity deserve our esteem and support for their dedication to public service.
   
 But consider this disquieting statistic. According to a Brookings Institution essay, African Americans are 3.5 times more likely than white counterparts to be killed by police when they are not attacking or don't have a weapon. Think about that. Lethal force is more likely to be used against African Americans even when they don't pose a threat. It is for that reason that African American parents have the "talk" with their children, especially male teenagers, about the unpredictability of police encounters.
   
 This is a cold statistic, not a mushy bad apples narrative. The awkward conclusion is that the color of one's skin is a determining factor in many police stops, use of force and arrests. To our mind that signals a systemic problem that firing a few bad apples wouldn't resolve.
   
 For example, federal investigations during the Obama administration into police practices after high-profile incidents in Baltimore, Cleveland, New Orleans, Chicago and Ferguson, Mo., all found massive structural and cultural problems that extend beyond the officers in a particular case. In Baltimore, the report concluded that racial disparities existed "at every stage of BPD's enforcement actions, from the initial decision to stop individuals on Baltimore streets to searches, arrests, and uses of force." And this was after controlling for population and crime rates.
   
 The death of George Floyd is an appropriate time for departments everywhere to reflect and reassess. Effective policing is a two-way street. It requires community trust and support as well as officers who work to earn it.
   
 This is not the time to excuse or accuse. This is the time to look into police department practices and revise practices that adversely or unjustly impact communities that officers have sworn to protect.
   
 Every department should be reviewing officer training and tactics, with special attention to how to de-escalate situations and understanding implicit biases that everyone has. And police officers who patrol the right way also must be willing to break the thin blue line that too often has protected officers who should not have a badge or a gun. And this review should not be one-and-done in response to Floyd's death. It should be standard operating procedure.
   
 Police officers have the power of life and death and must understand that their actions in extreme circumstances can be charged as murder.
   
 The moment and the opportunity to reform is before us. If we fail to seize it, we will regret it for generations.

Researchers today think that it is actually humanity's destruction of biodiversity that creates conducive conditions for new viruses and diseases like COVID-19. In fact, an emerging discipline called planetary health focuses on the increasingly visible connections among the well-being of humans, other living beings and complete ecosystems. To add insult to injury, we need to add climate change to this mix that will create conditions that adversely impact human health, food and water.

A local, resilient economy ensures adequate supply of food and essential items when faced with pandemics, natural disasters and wars. It supports local communities and generates livelihood. In fact, supporting the local farmer, Kirana store and community was core to our village ecosystem. Local Economic Development (LED) strategies are being explored by communities, cities and governments around the world to respond to the challenges of globalisation. What does LED do? For a start, it is much more than economic growth. LED means inclusive growth, people participation, connecting communities for better employment and resource utilisation resulting in three areas of impact - better quality of life; poverty alleviation and social Inclusion for preservation of local art/culture/food/crafts etc. Local is so powerful that it forms the crux of low carbon circular economies. Local barbers, gadget repair shops, tailors, cobblers, vegetable vendors, grocery stores, craftsmen and farmers in the vicinity need the patronage of those with resources and means. Government schemes for local economy revival must focus on organic, pest-free fruits, vegetable and grains. During the pandemic we have seen the middlemen chain being broken as farmers reached out directly to customers. At the end of the day, customers are also happy with the availability of farm-to- fork at reasonable prices. Local avoids travel and logistics and that is an important carbon metric, but its benefits extend far beyond.

It is shameful that the Tunisian Minister of Defense met this initiative that threatens the country's sovereignty and its military decision by inviting the American military commander Stephen Townsend to visit Tunisia!

Clayton-Bradley Academy held its third graduation on schedule Thursday, June 4, but moved it to the Parkway Drive-In because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The private school had planned to make the Clayton Center for the Arts its standard venue for the annual celebration, after its second class held last year’s ceremony there.
 With the date set for this year’s graduation fast approaching and restrictions still in place for groups gathering inside, the school knew it would need another venue because it didn’t want to postpone the event or move the ceremony online.
 Although the Class of 2020 has only 10 graduates, the school expected more than 300 people to attend.
 “It’s a large community event,” Brad Rasmussen, upper school principal, explained in a phone interview this week. “We’re going to have a ball.”
 The school arranged for all the seniors to ride in open-air vehicles for the event, although they also walked across a stage while receiving diplomas. The ceremony included a mix of prerecorded and live elements.
 While hugs and handshakes were out because of social distancing, the school arranged for glow-in-the dark graduation tassels and glow sticks for guests for the after-dark sendoff following the ceremony.
 Although the prom was canceled, the senior trip to the Navaho Nation happened in late February and for the first time was captured on video for a documentary, Rasmussen said.
 The school’s traditional Senior Week activities had a few adjustments, with Adventure Day at one family’s lake home and the awards ceremony online instead of a banquet. Wednesday’s Senior Walk had the 10 in their graduation gowns standing in front of the school while others drove by with signs.
 Clayton-Bradley plans to begin its next school year July 17 with a dual platform of digital and in-person learning, Rasmussen said.
