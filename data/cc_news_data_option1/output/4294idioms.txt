RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) — The man who bought two rifles that terrorists used to kill 14 people in a 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was sentenced Friday to 20 years in prison.
 Enrique Marquez Jr. supplied the weapons that Syed Rizwan Farook and Farook's wife, Tashfeen Malik, used on Dec. 2, 2015, to open fire on a meeting and holiday gathering of San Bernardino County employees who worked with Farook. Minutes later, a post on a Facebook page associated with Malik pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State terror group. The couple fled and died later that day in a gunbattle with authorities.
 Marquez, 28, showed no emotion during the federal court hearing as relatives of the victims asked the judge to give him a lengthy sentence. Gregory Clayborn, whose daughter Sierra was killed, said Marquez should be held responsible for the massacre though he wasn't the gunman.
 "He's a terrorist, your honor," Clayborn told the judge. "And if you let him out, he's going to do it again."
 Prosecutors sought a 25-year sentence for Marquez, arguing he should be held responsible for giving semiautomatic weapons and explosives to Farook though he knew Farook was inspired by violent extremists and had plotted with him years earlier to kill large numbers of people in attacks on a highway and college campus.
 Federal prosecutor Melanie Sartoris said Marquez has a high IQ and the mental capacity to understand the likelihood of an attack occurring once he had bought the weapons.
 "He knew all along that this would happen," but he did nothing, she said.
 The defense had asked for a five-year term, according to court filings. Defense attorney John Aquilina said his client had been manipulated by Farook since he was 13, when they met as neighbors.
 Marquez was desperate to socialize with others and needed to escape abuse at home. He had stopped speaking to Farook years before the attack and didn't know it was going to happen, Aquilina said. He had bought the guns years earlier.
 "Mr. Marquez's sentence should not be reflective of what happened in San Bernardino," he said.
 In determining the sentence, U.S. District Judge Jesus Bernal said he took into account that Marquez had called 911 and cooperated with authorities.
 "In a legal sense, I cannot punish Mr. Marquez for your loss," Bernal told the families in his courtroom. "He is not responsible for the murders."
 Several years before the massacre, Marquez and Farook had plotted terrorist attacks on Riverside City College and a highway, State Route 91, federal authorities said.
 Marquez abandoned the idea and distanced himself from Farook in 2012 after three other Southern California men were arrested on suspicion of planning to go to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops. Eventually, the three and a fourth man were sentenced to federal prison for conspiracy.
 To carry out the shooting, Farook and Malik left their 6-month-old daughter with Farook's mother, saying they were going to a doctor's appointment. Afterward, police chased the pair through San Bernardino, which is 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Los Angeles. Soon after they were killed, Marquez called 911 to say the shooter was his neighbor and had used his gun.
 The next day, Marquez went to a hospital emergency room and was placed in a psychiatric ward. He was later arrested, and in FBI interviews, described his research into terror attacks, purchase of explosives and the plans he had made with Farook, the government said.
 Marquez pleaded guilty in 2017 to conspiring with Farook to provide material support to terrorists and making false statements regarding the rifles he had purchased in his name using Farook's money. He later tried to withdraw his plea to one of the counts, but the request was denied by the court.

This is just how Pesci has played his mob characters though, larger than life and meaner than hell since he doesn't take anything from anyone and he's bound to shoot a person just for getting their drink order wrong. Plus, in the movie, it's easy to see that very few people can really handle him since even the bosses don't know what to do with him half the time.

Halloween, more than almost any other holiday, is about fun. It's like New Year's, but with corn syrup instead of booze.      It began with the Gaelic festival Samhain, which celebrated the end of harvest while ushering in the dark half of the year, a spooky time when the boundaries between the living and spirit worlds were thought to become more porous. Brought to America by Irish and Scottish settlers, Halloween found footholds in the southern colonies, and developed a more playful, mischievous, and decidedly corny vibe.      Candy corn didn't start out as a Halloween treat but jumped on the bandwagon in the 1950s, as Halloween pivoted into a full embrace of processed sugar.      Corn officially became spooky with the release of "Children of the Corn," a 1984 movie about a Midwestern village where the kids took over and decided nobody was permitted to age beyond 17. In 1993, the world's first for-profit corn maze was built in Annville, Pennsylvania. Since then the tradition has taken off, and corn mazes now number in the thousands.      When I lived in New Mexico I learned about chicos, a type of Native American dried corn. "Chicos" means "little boys" in Spanish, as the kernels shrink when dried. The ones for sale at the store were dried to the hardness of popcorn, but when I make them at home I let them stay a bit chewy, like real- life versions of candy corn. Each batch of chicos has a unique character, with different levels of brown, crunchiness, chewiness and/or sweetness, depending on the corn and how long it's roasted.      Many Halloween corn mazes are closed this year, thanks to COVID-19. And door- to-door candy-begging is largely out, too. If treat-seekers are left to their own devices I'm fine with that, because processed sugar is poison, and a tradition that hinges on giving candy to kids isn't worth rescuing.      So allow me to tell you how I make chicos. I made about three dozen ears' worth, which won't last too long but is a nice stash. I will follow my chicos tips with a few recipes, one sweet and one savory, for how I used them.      Chicos   The only ingredient is corn, preferably with the husk on. Traditionally, the process involves a clay oven or "horno," but other ovens work, too. Ultimately, you're doing little more than drying out corn.      Although usually made with fresh corn, I've also made chicos with frozen corn, and the operation was surprisingly successful, even if the product lacked the soulful smokey flavor that a roasted corn husk imparts.      Turn the oven to 300 F and place the ears directly on the oven racks, not touching one another, and bake until the husks start to dry out and brown and even smoke a little, about three hours. When cool, peel off the husks. If using husked or frozen corn, skip this step.      Turn oven down to 225. Put the cobs on the oven racks, spaced so as not to touch one another, and bake until the kernels start to shrink and visibly dry out, about four hours. Let the ears cool completely, and rub off the kernels -- use the edge of a spoon if they are stubborn. Store in a plastic bag in a cool, dry place. The drier you get them, the longer they will store.      If making chicos from frozen corn, spread the kernels on a cookie sheet and bake at 225. They will take less time -- about two hours -- and will quickly turn brown and then black.      Chicos and Milk   Fill a bowl with chicos and milk, with sugar to taste. When the chicos are gone and you sip the sweet milk that remains, you may feel a distinct deja vu to a time, long ago, when you sipped the sweet leftover milk from a bowl of corn flakes or Frosted Flakes.      Beans with Chicos   A handful of chicos turns a pot of beans into something interesting and delightful. Served alongside rice, you've got a delicious meal with complete protein.   Serves 2   • 1 strip bacon (optional, recommended), chopped   • 1 tablespoon olive oil if skipping the bacon or if it's lean   • ½ cup minced onions   • 1 clove garlic, minced   • 1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano or thyme   • ¼ cup chicos   • 1 can plain beans (pinto, white, black, kidney) including the liquid   • 1 can water or stock   • 1 teaspoon paprika or chile powder to taste   • Salt, if the bacon doesn't add enough   Fry the bacon on medium heat. When half-crispy, about five minutes, add the onions, garlic and herbs. Fry until the onions become translucent. Add the chicos, beans, water and paprika, and stir together. Season with salt, if necessary. Heat to a simmer, stirring as necessary to prevent sticking. Adjust seasoning and serve.

But he says the agency should not consider broader issues such as how the project would affect climate change. Enbridge is seeking state and federal permission to move a segment of Line 5 that runs through the Straits of Mackinac to a tunnel.

George always liked a challenge, so he decided to start his own business. He started a septic service business from scratch, to serve the Seven Lakes, and Greater Wakefield Area. That business is known as Lakes Region Septic Service, and is still family owned and operated in Sanbornville today.
 George continued to thirst for new business ventures; this man grew no moss! He passed the septic business onto his sons. From there George decided to give the commercial fishing business a try with his oldest son Steven as his first mate.
 George went back to his roots after several years of fishing. His passion as a plumber was a persistent one. He and his son Steven found opportunity in the U.S. Virgin Islands. They built a successful business in St. Thomas; a plumbing supply store, which they operated for 25 years.
 George was never short on advice to give. He had a vast knowledge of many trades. No matter the problem, George always found a solution. And he did not shy away from a challenge. He also did NOT shy away from the opportunity to express his opinions!
 George had many other passions as well. Namely, playing pool, Boston’s team sports, going to boxing matches, reading, the ocean, and working with his hands. George was a man of productivity. This man had wheels that were always turning.
 He was survived by his wife, Lucille Lineham, of Sanbornville; son, Stephen Lineham of Sanbornville; son, John Robert Lineham, and his wife Kimberly (Osborne) Lineham of Brookfield; son, David Alan Lineham, and wife Kay Lineham of Lincoln; and grandchildren, Stevie Leigh Lineham, David Edward Lineham, Morgan Datson Lineham and Haley Deldeo Lineham.
 He was also survived by sister, Susan Robinson, of Charlestown, R.I.
 A graveside service was held Saturday, Oct. 17, at the Lovell Lake Cemetery in Sanbornville with Father Patrick officiating and military honors provided by the United States Army. A Celebration of Life will follow in the spring, the date to be determined.

He was previously the training director for the Connecticut Fire Academy for six years and, before that, was a part-time adjunct instructor at the academy for 19 years.
 Higgins’ experience also includes 25 years at the Southington Fire Department, from which he retired in 2015 as a captain and shift commander.
 At Enfield Fire District 1, he has already begun exploring new training options and has conducted individual meetings with the station’s members regarding changes they would like to see, he said.
 Higgins was chosen from a pool of at least 17 applicants, said Board of Fire Commissioners President Vincent Grady.
 The position was vacant for months before Higgins’ appointment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some applicants withdrew from consideration due to the delay, Grady said.
 “We brought a panel of chiefs and training officers, and we wanted to make it as safe as possible,” the board president said of the delay. “We waited a while until it was comfortable for the panel to come in and interview candidates.”

KINDE - The North Huron Warriors varsity football team fell just shy of an unbeaten regular season on Friday night, falling at home to a tough Mayville team, 48-28.      Leading the way for the Warriors, who finish the 2020 season at 5-1 and as North Central Thumb League Stripes division champion, were Christian Brown, who rushed for 133 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries; Will Case, who ran for 101 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 18 carries; Tyler Moore, who had four carries for 65 yards and a TD; and Joe Weiss, who ran for 15 yards and had an extra point.      Leaders on defense for North Huron were Weiss with 12 tackles, Case with nine tackles, Noah Koth with eight tackles - four for a loss and one sack - and Brown and Alex Koehn with seven tackles each. Moore had two tackles and an interception.      Warriors head coach Chad Knoblock said his team had more than its fair share of opportunities on Friday night and only trailed by six points at halftime. After taking the opening kickoff in the second half, the Warriors drove the length of the field for a touchdown. On the ensuing drive, the North Huron defense forced Mayville's offense into a 4th-and-21 situation, which the Wildcats would convert into a touchdown.      "That was the turning point," Knoblock said. "We had had too many penalties, and we made too many mental mistakes. Not to take anything away from Mayville - they're a very good team - but we did not do ourselves any favors tonight. You can't make that many mistakes against a good team and expect to win."      Knoblock told his players after the game that even though the final score was not in their favor, the hung with a good team for almost the entire game and that the Warriors are a legitimate contender heading into the postseason. He added there were many good things his team could take away from Friday night's game and they can build on those positives as they prepare for the playoffs.      North Huron will learn which team they will face in Week 1 of the playoffs when the MHSAA announces matchups on Sunday.

HARBOR BEACH - The Unionville-Sebewaing Area varsity football team closed out the 2020 regular season with a 36-0 win over the Pirates in Harbor Beach.      The Patriots finish the regular season with a record of 4-2. The Pirates ended the season with a mark of 3-3.      USA took an 8-0 lead on a Braylon Ballard nine-yard rushing touchdown and two- point conversion run by Connor Gettel. On the ensuing possession, Harbor Beach would drive all the way down inside the USA five-yard line but come up short as the Patriots defense came up with a huge stop on fourth down.      Ballard would soon score his second touchdown of the game on a 91-yard touchdown run. The two-point conversion would fail, and the USA lead would stand at 14-0. Walker Foley would give the Patriots their third touchdown of the half with a three-yard TD run, and Ballard would punch in the two-point try to give the Patriots a 22-0 lead heading into halftime.      In the third quarter, Gettel would increase USA's lead on a 15-yard touchdown run. The two-point try would not succeed, and the Patriots led 28-0. Gettel would pick up his second rushing touchdown on the night with a 10-yard run. Noah Crumm would convert the two-point attempt on a short run, giving the Patriots a 36-0 lead.      "I thought our guys were focused through four quarters and executed very well both on offense and defense," USA head coach Josh Hahn said. "(I was) very proud of our team tonight."      Ballard would finish the game with 207 yards rushing on 17 carries and two touchdowns. Foley had 89 yards on 14 carries and one score. Gettel finished with 35 yards on four carries and a pair of TDs.      Leading the way on defense for the Patriots were Jacob Nimtz with seven tackles, Jeremiah Hahn and Dakota Miller with six tackles each, Ballard with five tackles, Carson Holland and Keegan Bixman with four tackles each and Chase Payne and Foley with three tackles apiece. The Patriots defense held Harbor Beach to 121 yards of total offense.      Leaders on the night for the Pirates were Luke Woodke with 97 yards rushing on 14 carries and 14 yards receiving on two receptions. On defense, Woodke had eight tackles, Dylan Kadar had six tackles and Grant Smaglinski, Caden Boynton and Woodke had five tackles each.

UBLY - Carson Heleski's four rushing touchdowns led the Ubly Bearcats varsity football team past visiting Bad Axe, 36-0, on Friday night.      Bearcat Logan Mueller added another score on the ground as Ubly finished the regular season with a record of 4-2.      The Hatchets, who saw their four-game winning streak snapped, also ended the season at 4-2. Both teams await their Week 1 playoff matchups, which will be announced Sunday by the MHSAA.      Ubly head coach Eric Sweeney said he told his players just before the game that they had a chance to earn a couple home playoff games with a win Friday night. Ubly has traditionally had a great rivalry with Bad Axe, he said, so his team had plenty of motivation when the game began.      "Our kids were ready to play tonight," he said.      Heading into the playoffs, Sweeney said he knows there's always room for improvement. Freshman quarterback Evan Peruski has shown growth since the start of the season, and the rest of the Bearcats must follow suit if they want to have a successful playoff run. They've got to protect the ball and maintain focus in order to win, he said.      "I think we improve from week to week, and that's what we have to keep doing," Sweeney said.      Hatchets head coach Kal Pokley took responsibility for Friday night's outcome and gave a lot of credit to the Bearcats. He said the Hatchets offense didn't move the ball as well as it needed to, and he planned to look at game film to see what adjustments he and his coaches will need to make right the ship.      "Their boys worked hard all night," Pokley said. "Hats off to them for sure."      The Hatchets have been dealing with some injuries, and he said it's up to the coaching staff to put the right players in the right spots. The loss to Ubly was a learning experience for himself as well as his players, he said, and it gives the Hatchets something to build on moving forward into the postseason.      "Hopefully, it's going to pan out in a positive direction for us that will give us some different looks that we weren't able to produce (Friday) night," Pokley said.

Horseshoe Bend had its first real offensive success of the first half on the next drive, as an impressive run by Gavin Brazzell put the Generals inside the Lanett red zone.
 Horseshoe Bend called up a trick play to try to get on the scoreboard, but Brazell’s halfback pass was intercepted by Zachary in the end zone.
 The Generals found themselves right back in business again though, as Lanett went three-and-out and the Panthers punt on fourth down essentially went nowhere.
 However, the ensuing drive ended in a familiar fashion.
 Zachary picked off a pass in the end zone and returned it 95 yards before stepping out of bounds at the 10-yard line. Two plays later, Alanteo Cheeks scored from 5 yards out to put Lanett up 24-0. Seidron Langston caught a two- point conversion — one of two on the night — to put Lanett up 26-0.

When I get stressed out, I break things. I don’t mean deliberately; I mean the accidentally tripping, spilling and dropping type of breaking things. Maybe it’s because I’m distracted, and not being mindful. But then I don’t have to be stressed out to be distracted and unmindful.
 Maybe it’s vertigo, a rare side effect from the only medication I take. But I don’t get dizzy; I just break things, unintentionally.
 Until now. I will explain that in short order. But first, in case anyone else has just woken up from a 100-year nap, or even a 4-year one, they are probably feeling edgy, too. A pandemic, catastrophic storms, polar ice sheets melting, people living in alternative universes, and now less than two weeks until … I could go on and on, but I won’t. Because I haven’t lost a job, I don’t have kids at home so I’m not trying to school anybody, nobody’s sick, and rent is not past due. So, “No complaining, Jeanne!”
 Fall is always an antsy time for me. I think my little squirrel brothers and sisters out there are feeling it, too. More than ever, we’re forgetting where we put our nuts and seeds. And where’s my saved garlic? Is it time to bury some for next year? But where? Should I keep running back and forth with sheets and blankets for the tomatoes at night? No, stop! They’re a lost cause.
 Besides that, I’m in the midst of another crushing plum harvest — that I promised I wouldn’t complain about either because I still remember a couple years ago when I got all of three plums from nine trees. They had mysteriously decided to take a year off. Actually, I must admit it was nice for me to have a year off too, and I finally got my plum cookbook done.
 I might be anthropomorphizing about my squirrels, but I’ve been more than rattled.
 Just a bit ago, I was attempting to clear off my patio and tidy up for fall when, tripping over my chard collection of chipped dishes, spout-less teapots and extra tiles I’ve scored or traded for (for what else but ArtCamp mosaics that didn’t happen this past summer), I suddenly got an idea.
 How about that birdbath? The artsy metal one I’ve had for several years but couldn’t attract any birds because I don’t think they liked the rust I let build up in the bowl. But now, how about making it all bright and colorful?
 I went out and bought a wet saw. That made things even more fun because then I could put on ear protection and saw and make all kinds of loud noise, too.But the most fun of all was putting a plate or cup on the cement, inside two layers of canvas, and then bashing it with my hammer. Not quite like a 300-yard drive down the middle of the fairway, but none of the controlled fuss of a 10-fooy curling putt...With no particular plan, I just started breaking and placing things around the circular bowl. I got lost in it all for several days, out in the fresh air, buttering thin-set, smearing grout, then sponging and filling and dumping buckets of water. It was heaven. I actually finished the birdbath, let it cure for a couple days, and the birds actually came and started using it.
 I had another birdbath, with a cracked and chipped top, on a separate base. With all the gear out, since I was on a roll, I could mosaic that one too. I decided to go for it.
 But then I dropped the base and it shattered.
 Oh well. The nights are getting colder and it’s time to put ceramic birdbaths away for the winter season anyhow. That’s so frozen water and snow won’t crack them. Yes, as you may have guessed, I learned that the hard way.
 So I got back to tidying up the patio, packing away the remaining chards and all the gear for next summer. In the months between now and then, when I chip or break some plate or dish, I won’t get on my own case anymore. And if things around me get really bad, I’ll take it, along with my hammer and canvas, and head out to the cement patio.

Springfield Catholic came back almost six minutes later to score their first of the game, and the teams would head to the second tied at 7.
 It didn’t take long at all for the Tigers to get some points up on the board. Senior Konner Hatfield found his way to the endzone just seven seconds into the second quarter. The extra point was good for the Tigers once again, putting them up 14-7 less than ten seconds into the second. The Fighting Irish answered with one of their own a few minutes later to make it a tie game once again.

Benny Snell looks good in his 2nd year, leaner and a hint faster. He rushed for 113 yards in the opener when Conner sustained an ankle injury but has been prone to putting the ball on the carpet, something that will land you on the bench under Mike Tomlin.

The usually indefatigable Mahendra Singh Dhoni conceded to being hurt at the way Chennai Super Kings’ IPL campaign has hurtled from one disaster to another but ruled out benching himself from the remaining three games, saying “a captain can’t run away“.
 CSK are all but out of reckoning from a play-offs spot and Dhoni said the three remaining games would be an exercise in understanding how the side should plan for the next season. They next take on Royal Challengers Bangalore on Sunday.
 “We have to make the most of the next three games and it is good preparation for the next year. Identify the batsmen, who will bowl at the death and hopefully the players will soak up the pressure,” he said after the 10-wicket loss to Mumbai Indians here on Friday.
 “Captain can’t run away, so I’ll be playing in all the games,” he added.
 CSK have just six points from 11 matches and are at the bottom of the IPL points table. Dhoni said several factors have contributed to the dismal run.
 “...it hasn’t been our year. Whether you lose by 8 or 10 wickets, it hardly matters, but where we are at this stage of the tournament, it does hurt. What you need to see is where we actually went wrong, right from the second game,” he said.
 “There can be a 100 reasons, but one of the main things you ask yourself is whether you’ve played to the potential you’ve got no matter the conditions. When you put a good team on paper, have we done enough to back up the stats? And this year we haven’t.”
 The former India captain said luck also did not favour CSK this time.
 “It was more about the bowling. Rayudu got injured, the other batsman were maybe not there 200% and in cricket when you’re going through a tough phase, you need a bit of luck.

 “The games we wanted to bat first, we haven’t won the toss, and there’s no dew and all of a sudden when we bat first there’s dew,” he said.
 He said there have been just too many batting failures this season.
 “You can’t always think the result will go your way. Even when you’re hurting, you try to smile and take it on the chin. I feel the boys have done that, they’ve tried to perform.”
 Dhoni said the remaining three games will be an ideal opportunity to give a platform to the youngsters.
 Victorious Mumbai Indians’ stand-in captain Kieron Pollard, on the other hand, described the win as a team effort.
 “We wanted to bowl them out under 100 but Sam batted well. I think it was a total team effort,” said Pollard who led MI in the absence of injured Rohit Sharma.
 “Two-three wickets early puts you in the game and to get 4-5 is fantastic. Then the openers going out and finishing off and not leaving any uncertainty was good.”
 He said MI would want to finish in top-two in the league phase but said it’s about getting the points and not thinking about play-offs opponents.
 “There’s always room for improvement, myself making some mistakes on the field, guys not being aware in certain situations. Maybe it’s no technical, but it’s things you need to speak about.”
 On leading the side, he said, “It (captaincy is part and parcel of it, sometimes you don’t actually have to be a leader to be a leader.”
 “I know a thing or two. So it was just a matter of me stepping in and it came off tonight. It was just matter of making right decisions, not giving them freebies.”

As part of his damage control, Biden dispatched running mate Kamala Harris to help clarify his position as she campaigned in swing state Georgia.
 “Let’s be really clear about this: Joe Biden is not going to ban fracking,” Harris said, referring to a technique that uses pressurized liquid to extract oil or natural gas. “He is going to deal with the oil subsidies. You know, the president likes to take everything out of context. But let’s be clear, what Joe was talking about was banning subsidies, but he will not ban fracking in America.”
 As he campaigned in The Villages, Trump fired an insult at Harris that pointed to her gender, quickly stirring criticism.
 “Kamala will not be your first female president," Trump declared. "Look, we’re not going to be a socialist nation. We’re not going to have a socialist president, especially any female socialist president.”
 As for Biden and oil, while ending the nation's reliance on fossil fuel is popular among many liberals, the idea could hurt him among working-class voters in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas who depend on the industry, and fracking in particular, to make a living.
 Trump's allies immediately began running new attack ads seizing on the Democrats' inconsistent answers on energy. And Trump played a video at his Pensacola rally that included past comments from Biden and Harris about fracking, which Harris supported banning during her primary campaign.
 As part of his plan to fight climate change, Biden has said he would ban new gas and oil permits — including fracking — on federal lands only. The vast majority of oil and gas does not come from federal lands.

Pocatello took advantage of one Century fumble in the second half to cut the gap to 20-14 on a short touchdown pass from Zach Park to Jaxon Williams. When Century fumbled and the Indians recovered on the ensuing kickoff, it looked like Pocatello was en route to a stirring comeback, the perfect capper to a special season.
 But the Century defense forced a turnover on downs, and the Diamondbacks, starting on their own 18, rattled off an 11-play, 82-yard touchdown drive, with running back Drew Roberts bulling over from the 1-yard line for a 28-14 lead early in the fourth quarter.
 Pocatello had two more drives, but punted on fourth-and-6 from the 45 on the first one. With time running out and the Indians getting close to needing a miracle, Century's Jovan Sowell stepped in front of a Park pass in the red zone for an interception to end it.
 The district title was Century's third in a row. The Diamondbacks (5-3, 2-0) are expected to be the No. 3 seed in the 16-team 4A state football playoffs, although that will be confirmed Sunday when the MaxPreps rankings are updated.
 Pocatello (6-2, 1-1) also has a spot in the playoffs, although the Indians' seeding is yet to be determined.

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration and House Democratic leaders are in striking range of a deal to send $1,200 stimulus checks to American families and to pump $2 trillion into the flagging economy.
 But Rich Mitch is having none of it.
 As The Washington Post reported, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) -- anti-Trump Republicans have taken to calling him "Rich Mitch" because of his $34 million net worth -- told Republican colleagues Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike an agreement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on a coronavirus relief package before the Nov. 3 election.
 Who cares if tens of millions of Americans are in increasingly desperate straits? Even if negotiators reach agreement despite McConnell's sabotage, he refused to commit to voting on it before the election.
 Then, on Wednesday, McConnell had the chutzpah to stand on the Senate floor and claim he was looking out for the little guy. "Maybe coastal elites who can practically find a million dollars in their couch cushions are indifferent about whether we get an outcome here," he said, alleging that "blue-state billionaires" are Democrats' top priority -- not "working families like the Kentuckians I represent."
 McConnell had just blocked $1,200 checks for working families. He had blocked expanded food stamps for the hungry. He had blocked protections for those in danger of losing their homes. He had blocked funds that would avoid another round of job losses in states and municipalities. Instead of a $2 trillion relief package that enjoys the support of more than 7 in 10 Americans, he offered a previously rejected plan with a quarter of the relief and a corporate liability shield so working people won't be made whole if an employer's recklessness makes them sick.
 Yet, McConnell claims he's fighting elites to "get an outcome" for working families. What outcome? Bankruptcy?
 It's a timely reminder, a dozen days before Election Day, that removing President Trump won't repair dysfunction in Washington as long as McConnell remains in charge of the Senate.
 The apparent absence of any principle but power in McConnell, and his ability to propound rank dishonesty with perfect piety, should have lost the ability to shock by now. He righteously insisted that no Supreme Court nominee be considered eight months before an election and now plans to ram through a Supreme Court confirmation eight DAYS before an election. He successfully fought bipartisan efforts to protect the election now underway from Russian interference.
 Yet, this one is particularly cruel. We're in the most unequal recovery in modern history, with low-income families and racial minorities suffering disproportionately, and McConnell is blocking a rescue while blaming others.
 He has been politically unwise; had he allowed a vote on the $3 trillion relief package that passed the House in May, that stimulus would now be buoying the economy, to Trump's, and Republicans', benefit. (At the time, McConnell said he hadn't "felt the urgency" of immediate action.)
 He has been inconsistent; after allowing a $7 trillion increase in the debt under Trump, much of it in gifts to the wealthy, he has found deficit religion now that ordinary people need more help as they face the pandemic's second wave.
 He's being reckless with the human cost of his actions; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said that too little stimulus "would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses" -- a warning echoed with growing alarm by other Fed officials and economists in recent days.
 And McConnell's being cynical. He told Republican colleagues he didn't want a coronavirus relief deal before the election so he could keep the focus on the Supreme Court confirmation. He also wants to avoid a vote on a major relief bill that would split Republicans.
 So, on Wednesday, he served up the same fig-leaf relief bill he offered last month, and it met with the same party-line failure -- but not before the majority leader performed one more Orwellian chef-d'oeuvre.
 Claiming Democrats should support his bill because it contains (small) quantities of relief programs they like, McConnell said: "It turns out there's a special perk to being a United States senator. When you actually support something, you get to vote for it." He repeated the line for emphasis.
 That is some world-class cant. McConnell has refused for five months to allow a vote on the House-passed, $3 trillion relief bill. He won't commit to a pre- election vote on a $2 trillion compromise he's trying to kill. And, yet, he stands on the Senate floor, chin in chest, sneer on lips, and says, "When you actually support something, you get to vote for it"?
 That's rich, Mitch.

CAIRO (AP) — Egyptians began voting Saturday in the first stage of a parliamentary election, a vote that is highly likely to produce a toothless House of Representatives packed with supporters of President Abdel-Fattah el- Sissi.
 The elections are taking place as the Arab world’s most populous country faces a slight increase in coronavirus cases, with authorities warning that a second wave of the pandemic lies ahead.
 Like the Senate elections in August, Egyptian election authorities said face masks would be handed out to voters for free and polling stations were disinfected.
 Some 63 million voters are eligible to vote in the two-stage election, with results announced in early December. Election authorities reiterated previous warnings that those who boycott the vote could be fined up to 500 Egyptian pounds ($32).
 A total of 568 seats are up for grabs, with over 4,000 candidates running as individuals competing for 50% of the seats. Prominent, wealthy government- affiliated power brokers have an advantage.
 The other 50% of House seats are reserved for over 1,100 candidates running on four party lists. El-Sissi will name 28 seats, or 5%, bringing the total number of seats in the chamber to 596.

The 8th episode of 'Tehran' starts off by throwing the limelight on Tamar, who needs to take a final decision after her multiple trysts. She has one final chance to complete her mission. However, her last attempt turns out to be easier than expected -- since she now has Milad by her side. Tamar discovers that Yael has no intention of leaving Milad alive. Tamar, therefore, thinks of a plan where she can set him free while still maintaining the facade that Milad is vital for the mission to succeed. On the other hand, when Ali starts doubting Mohammadi's end goal, he decides to include Faraz in the loop. Faraz, eventually, meets up with Tamar but things do not go the way he had hoped.

Anyone who’s followed the IJ for a few years — maybe not our full 101 years, mind you — knows we will weigh in on various issues, usually local or state ones, but when Election Day rolls around we tend to steer clear of endorsing candidates.
 A few candidates through the years have sought our endorsement. As many, perhaps even more, have politely asked we not endorse them for fear doing so would derail their campaign and kill their chances of winning.
 I have worked in newspapers that did not endorse and even worked at a paper where we did not endorse under one publisher but did under another. A no- endorsement policy makes the lives of editorial writers easier, I’ll say that, but I understand the reasoning behind both approaches.
 However, in these particularly contentious times, I’m relieved that we merely urge voters to vote for the candidate they think is best for the particular position. Endorsing would be a no-win situation for us. Really, for just about any newspaper these days.
 It perplexes me that quite a few readers apparently think a newspaper shouldn’t have an opinion at all. We’ve had our share of comments — mind you, only on social media, as though it’s the only legitimate platform for voicing one’s opinions — from readers who say we should just report the news, not share an opinion about it. Newspapers are steeped in a tradition of reporting and opining on the news. That some people did not or do not know that is a foreign concept to me, having been doing this gig since 1980. Newspapers have expressed opinions, separate from their news stories, long before these pundits on radio and TV began running their mouths in an effort to run up ratings and viewership among those who share common political views.
 It is funny, or at least ironic, that the same people who chastise papers for trying to present a thoughtful view on an issue, especially local issues, apparently don’t mind being inundated with sound bite commercials and equally obnoxious postcards that trot out vitriolic and false messages.
 We have very possibly gotten to a point where there is no compromise or willingness to hear another’s point of view, opting instead to find validation by surrounding themselves only with like-minded people. They hunker down — perhaps bunker down is a more apt term — in the belief that their herd mentality is not only correct, but also will thrive, so long as they fire volleys at those with whom they disagree rather than sit at a table and seek understanding, and — gasp! — perhaps compromise.

Electric vehicles (EVs) have been around for a while, but not in the capacity that they are today. While the Mahindra eVerito is the longest-running EV in India, it is by no means, the most advanced. And while the need for EVs is growing, manufacturers will do all they can to move into that new era.
 For Mercedes-Benz, the kick-off took place with the launch of the Mercedes- Benz EQC, an SUV that runs plainly on electricity but behaves exactly the way you would imagine a car would.
 Starting off with design, Mercedes hasn’t bothered with a futuristic approach. The EQC gets traditional SUV styling complete with a grille up front. The styling itself is different, however, and the EQC will stand out when placed among other Mercedes SUVs. What Mercedes has done is they haven’t scratch- built this car, they’ve just electrified the GLC and that is what you get to see.

Short of raking up all the acorns as they fall or getting rid of the oaks — two things that would be considered “end of the rope” actions — there are many devices on the market to frighten the woodpeckers away.
 Experts recommend using objects that move in the wind, generate noise or confuse the birds. You can find motion-activated large, hairy spiders that will drop down and wiggle their legs when a woodpecker approaches.
 Shiny objects that move with the wind are good, too. You can buy ones specially made as bird deterrents, or make your own with old CDs. Scare balloons also can be helpful. Hawk mobiles — the dangly, hawk silhouette ones, can also work, as can recorded sounds of predator birds, although you’ll hear those cries, too.
 The main problem with all these solutions is that your woodpeckers are established residents and believe they have as much right to your yard as you do. Birds that have been at it as long as these have won’t leave easily, nor will they want to abandon their food supply. You may drive yourself nuts trying to drive them away, and consider the cost of new siding well worth it.
 Having a place for them to go as an alternative to using your tree house as a granary could be important. Providing them with a tree stump, a large section of an old tree, or another wooden structure slapped together, could do the trick. If they don’t feel safe using the tree house, they might turn to the next available option.
 Unfortunately, that means the rat-a-tat-tat will continue. Sorry I don’t have better options for you, but you know what they say — if you can’t beat them, join them. Have you ever considered taking up the drums?

LOS ANGELES — Gardner Minshew and Justin Herbert don't remember much about the previous time they faced each other. The only thing they are focused on is trying to help their teams snap losing streaks.
 Minshew's Jacksonville Jaguars and Herbert's Los Angeles Chargers are looking for their first wins since Week 1. The Jaguars (1-5) have dropped five straight while the Chargers (1-4) have lost their past four.
 “It’s easy to get frustrated. It’s sometimes hard to find the bright side of things, but that’s what we have to do, and I think that’s what we are doing right now,” Minshew said.
 Minshew says he hasn't met Herbert, but he does have a victory over him from 2018 when he threw four touchdowns in Washington State's 34-20 victory over Oregon. Herbert said the only thing that stands out from that game is that the Ducks lost.
 “He’s been really fun to watch and just the way he’s handled everything,” Herbert said of Minshew. “He is a top-notch guy and has had a lot of success on the field. I'm really glad to see a Pac 12 guy like that.”
 Minshew played in 14 games and started 12 as a rookie last season after the Jaguars drafted him in the sixth round. He became only the fourth rookie to throw for 20 touchdowns with six or fewer interceptions, leading Jacksonville to six wins.
 Success has been harder to come by this season. Even though Minshew has completed 25 or more passes in five straight games, he has also been picked off five times. Jacksonville has been plagued by slow starts during its losing streak, being outscored 82-40 during the first half.
 Herbert, the sixth overall pick in April's draft, has exceeded expectations. His 68.8 percent completion rate and 107.1 passer rating in four starts are the highest by a rookie quarterback in NFL history with a minimum of 100 attempts.
 Slow starts haven't been a problem for Los Angeles; it has been being able to hold on to a lead. The Chargers have blown double-digit advantages in three of their last four games, including 17-point second-quarter leads in the past two.
 “I think finishing in the second half is gonna be huge for us. And putting together a full game is what’s gonna separate us,” Herbert said.
 ON THE RUN
 With Austin Ekeler on injured reserve with a hamstring injury, the Chargers will need more production out of Joshua Kelley and Justin Jackson to prevent teams from consistently applying pressure to Herbert.
 Los Angeles is averaging about 2.9 yards per carry the past two games and has had eight carries go for no gain or negative yards. In its first three games it was 4.3 yards per carry and only seven attempts that were stuffed.
 STAYING IN FRONT
 The Chargers may try to simplify their defensive game plan after their recent run of squandering leads. Defensive coordinator Gus Bradley said they have added more aggressive schemes but have been overwhelmed at times, especially late in games.
 Another key will be for the Chargers to get consistent pressure on the quarterback, which is something they haven't done well recently. They had only five pressures in last Monday's 30-27 loss at New Orleans.
 KICKING CAROUSEL
 Jacksonville hopes to get kicker Josh Lambo (hip) back after missing the last four games, losses in which the Jags used four different replacements. It would be a fitting return for a guy the Chargers gave up on in 2017.
 The Chargers cut Lambo in favor of trick-shot artist Younghoe Koo. They ended up using Koo, Nick Novak, Travis Coons, Nick Rose and even punter Drew Kaser that season. Michael Badgley, Caleb Sturgis, Chase McLaughlin, and Ty Long also have kicked since. Badgley is the current placekicker.
 Lambo, meanwhile, has made 74 of 78 field goals (94.9 percent) and 66 of 71 extra points (93 percent) since signing with Jacksonville.
 The Jaguars realized how spoiled they’ve been with Lambo the last four weeks, when Brandon Wright, Aldrick Rosas, Stephen Hauschka and Jon Brown missed a combined four field goals and an extra point.
 WEST COAST WOES
 Even though the Jaguars won in Oakland in December — the final game for the Raiders in the historic Coliseum — they have had little luck on the West Coast. Jacksonville is 3-12 on the opposite coast, with all three wins coming in Oakland.
 They are 0-2 in San Francisco, 0-3 in Seattle and 0-4 in San Diego. Maybe the trend will change with their first trip to Los Angeles.

But she admits, “Trump continues to have some support there.”
 She notes that while the stock market has seen historic highs during Trump’s time in the White House, “that’s not what the economy is all about.”
 The president has “no plan to address the pandemic,” establish a national virus testing system, or a way to widely distribute a vaccine, she says.
 “There’s no thought about anything, just saying whatever comes into his head at that moment,” DiNardo continues, adding that she believes Trump’s “racist comments” and “verbal assaults on women” have swayed some voters.
 “I definitely think that he has lost some people,” she says.
 With the Nov. 3 election a little over a week away, only time will tell who the diverse 2nd District will ultimately support in what some believe to be the most important presidential election of their lifetimes.
 “The 2nd District lives up to its reputation of being the most interesting of all, which is why I love it so much,” Courtney says.
 Ronald Klezos, a 68-year-old Enfield resident who’s lived in town his entire life, said he’s a former Obama voter who supports Trump.
 Klezos says he’s a registered independent who votes based on candidate rather than party. He says he can’t point to a “definite shift” politically in his community, but he thinks many people in the area will also vote to re-elect the president.
 “For some reason, it seems like an awful lot of people are going to be voting for Trump from Connecticut,” he says, adding that many locals he has spoken with, including people he doesn’t know personally, say they are supporting Trump.
 Although he previously thought Obama “deserved a chance,” he contends the former president did not deliver on his campaign promises.
 He also says Trump has managed to deliver on his campaign goals despite consistent resistance, and he stands against “both Democrats and Republicans who have been in (politics) for a long time” and are “only there to make money.”
 Michelle Hanson, a 45-year-old lifelong Suffield resident, says she is a former Democrat who, for the past eight years, has been a Republican-voting independent.
 She says the district flipping for Trump this election as he seeks his second term against the Democrat running for president, Joe Biden, Obama’s former vice president, would be “amazing.”
 A Catholic who called Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett “a beautiful woman who is a true feminist patriot,” Hanson says the Democratic Party has moved too far left on many issues, including abortion.
 She says the Democrats have abandoned their commitment to the working class while putting the country “in dire straits when it comes to our morals.”
 Despite her excitement at the prospect of a Trump victory in the district, Hanson says she is unsure if her hometown of Suffield has moved to the right. She says the town has consistently been “very split” on politics.
 William Baker, 89, has been a South Windsor resident since 1960. He says he was a Republican “a long time ago” but is now an independent who cast an early ballot for Biden.
 A disabled Marine Corps veteran who was injured in the Korean War, Baker has lived in the Watson Farm senior housing complex since 2003. He says most people in his community also plan on voting for Biden.
 Baker sayd he believes Trump is “narcissistic” and thinks his wealth allows him to “do what he wants, when he wants, and how he wants.”
 Although Baker is covered financially due to military benefits, he says others his age plan to vote for Biden because recent Social Security increases have not covered the cost of living.
 “They’re looking for someone to help the senior citizens,” he says.

There are plenty of movies out there that have a well-defined lead actor and yet somehow, someway, the supporting actor can sometimes steal the movie away without any real effort at all since their character is just that charismatic, the charming, or that terrifying. In this case, it's somehow hard to remember just who the main character really is and why they're important to the movie any longer, but in others, it's easier since the supporting actor might steal the show, but they'll also hand it back when it's time in order to keep everything rolling along as it should. In this manner a movie can actually become even better since it becomes a game of catch between the lead and the supporting actor in a way, a game that the audience gets to watch as the two actors, or more, continue to share the spotlight as the movie continues to unfold and the story pushes forward in a way that's even better since the lead and the supporting actor aren't fighting against each other but are at times trying to keep up with each other in order to keep the natural flow and rhythm going. When that kind of balance is struck it's absolutely great, but it's obvious which supporting actors have had the most pull throughout the years.
