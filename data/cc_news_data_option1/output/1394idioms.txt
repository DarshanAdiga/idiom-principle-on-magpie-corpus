And yet, the reality is that there are currently hundreds of thousands of people who are dramatically less capable of weathering this storm on their own. Not only must the State prolong and expand its existing support to care for the most vulnerable, but we must as a society come to terms with the inequalities of this place, inequalities that, after covid19, will have to be reckoned with.

Nearly 1.5 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed around the world, with more than 432,000 of them in the United States. More than 88,000 people have died from the virus, while nearly 330,000 have recovered, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

NO ICU beds in her electorate has raised serious alarm bells for Ann Leahy for when there is a confirmed case of covid-19 in the south west.
 The MP Member for Warrego said while confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been delayed in our isolated communities, realistically it is likely to hit the south west eventually.
 “The fact that we have no ICU beds is very concerning,” she said.
 “And I’ve been asking these questions since the first briefing of COVID-19 at last parliament sitting.
 “My concern is that if we have RDFS and LifeFlight doing these emergency retrievals, it will compromise our ability to deal with heart attacks, people who have a car accidents and compromise our emergency abilities of these services.
 “If we did have a COVID-19 case, and LifeFlight had to fly them out and then someone on the crew became unwell within 14 days, we would shut have to shut that whole base down which would be very concerning.”
 After doing her own research, Ms Leahy discovered Queensland Health had procured three challenger 604 aircrafts to be exclusively used for transporting COVID-19 patients from regional areas to intensive care.
 “I am also aware to the limitations of challenger aircrafts and to what airports they can land at,” she said.
 “While Charleville and Roma shouldn’t be a problem, getting into smaller airstrips such as Quilpie, Tambo, Chinchilla, Dalby and Dirranbandi could be a concern.”
 South West Hospital and Health Service Executive Director of Medical Services Dr Ross Duncan said the service has comprehensive plans in place to manage any cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) within the region.
 Dr Duncan said this included ensuring each facility has adequate supplies, equipment and other contingencies.
 “We have plans in place for the management of seriously ill patients, including those who may need respiratory assistance of any kind,” he said.
 “We have ventilators available in our emergency departments and operating theatres for the stabilisation of patients who require respiratory assistance while awaiting more specialised care.
 “Patients requiring ongoing complex respiratory support – or any form of more complex care – are transferred to a tertiary facility for specialised care.”
 Dr Duncan said all ambulances and retrieval aircraft have ventilator support for the safe transport of patients requiring respiratory support.
 “Aerial retrievals of patients with complex conditions from rural hospitals to a tertiary facility are coordinated by Queensland Health’s Retrieval Services Queensland,” he said.
 “Intensive care units are highly specialised units, with highly specialised staff, that are available only in tertiary facilities.
 “Patients from the south west requiring specialised care, including intensive care, are transferred safely to Toowoomba Hospital or a hospital in Brisbane and this standard procedure has not changed.
 “Travel restrictions do not impact on the activities of our aeromedical retrieval services.”
 The State Government recently announced funding for more aeromedical services as part of the $4 billion State Government package of additional support for health, jobs, households and businesses.
 As a result, three LifeFlight and Aspen Medical air ambulance jets have been added to Queensland Health’s aeromedical fleet.
 “It is critically important people practice social distancing and don’t travel over the Easter period,” Ms Leahy said.
 “We are a more precarious situation while it is comforting to know that there is a link there, we also need to be aware that it is not the be all and end all
 “I appeal to our residents, please keep this electorate covid-19 free. Everyone needs to do the right thing.
 “It is highly likely that your loved one is flown out, they may pass away in a hospital with no-one around them.
 “There’s nothing worse then dying alone.”

Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said Britons have responded “really well” to the measures but told ITV’s Peston: “It’s not a case of just throwing that away but in making sure, as we have done every step of the way in our plan, we listen to our experts, we come to a judgment and more of that will be discussed (on Thursday).”
 Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford earlier said the lockdown will not end in Wales next week, insisting “we will not throw away the gains” by “abandoning our efforts just as they begin to bear fruit”.
 Debate about the lockdown took place as Downing Street offered more hopeful news about the Prime Minister.
 Number 10 said Mr Johnson remains in intensive care but is making “steady progress”, with further updates expected on Thursday.
 Mr Sunak said the PM was “sitting up in bed” and “engaging positively” with the medics treating him for Covid-19 at St Thomas’s Hospital in London on Wednesday.
 But the boost came as the nation saw its record number of deaths in hospitals, with a rise of 938 taking the toll to at least 7,097, according to Department of Health figures.
 Though significantly larger than the previous highest toll of 786, Prof McLean said new cases are not “accelerating out of control”.
 At the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Sunak unveiled a £750 million bailout to keep struggling charities afloat in the Treasury’s latest emergency measure.
 Many charities welcomed the move but some also warned it must be the start – and not the end – of the Government’s efforts in protecting the sector.

 He finished by providing a simple action that can be taken to resolve this issue quickly advising her to send this message to her employer: “If you’re on furlough as an employee, you cannot work for your employer.
 “You can work for somebody else, if your employer allows you to, but you can’t work for your employer.”
 It is highly likely that furlough rules will play a key role over the coming weeks as lockdown continues and coronavirus continues to impact the economy.
 Businesses across the UK are suffering and many people are expected to be placed on furlough just to ensure that companies survive.
 The UK Government makes it clear that the furlough choice is ultimately the employers and not the employees.
 The policy outlines that as long as both parties are eligible and agree on the furlough plan, the employer must confirm it in writing.

"Morning everyone."
 At the sound of this prosaic but unmistakeable greeting, cricket fans for half a century knew they were about to spend a few hours in the company of one of the great sports broadcasters of the television age. All-rounder, Australia captain, journalist and author, Richie Benaud played other roles over his 84 years but they rarely took him far from the cricket oval.
 Few had more influence on the game in the latter half of the 20th century, from the on-pitch celebrations which helped drag cricket out of its post-war austerity to his championing of the World Series project that was to transform the sport. It was at the microphone that he had his biggest impact, of course, his idiosyncratic but always measured delivery becoming the favoured accompaniment to cricket for millions.
 "He was authoritative but not pedantic, dignified but not pompous, and never spoke unless he had something to say," Gideon Haigh wrote in his obituary of Benaud. "He was so popular that many humourists strove to imitate him, so distinctive that none ever quite got him right."
 Even without his mastery of the art of commentary, Benaud would still be remembered as one of cricket's finest leg-spinners and most successful test captains. As a bowler, magic came out of the back of his hand as it had for Bill "Tiger" O'Reilly before him, and as it would for Shane Warne after him.
 In the statistics so revered in cricket, he took 248 wickets at 27.03 and scored 2,201 runs at 24.45 over 63 tests. As a skipper, standing bare-headed with his white shirt unbuttoned to expose a bit of sun-tanned chest, he earned a reputation as one of a new breed of aggressive captains.
 That was most amply illustrated in the fourth test of the 1961 Ashes series at Old Trafford when, having decided saving the match was impossible, he sent his players out to win it. Benaud, bowling around the wicket, took 6-70 as they did just that, going 2-1 up in the series to ensure they would retain the urn.
 His playing peak probably came just before that when Australia took on Frank Worrell's West Indies in 1960-61, an exhilarating series that included the first tied test and a dramatic draw at Adelaide Oval. Always impeccably prepared for everything in life, Benaud had planned the transition into a media career long before he finally hung up his baggy green cap in 1964.
 His 42-year stint on British television came to the end at the conclusion of the 2005 Ashes series, when the crowd and both teams at the Oval rose to acclaim him. There was to be no similar send off in Australia after a car crash near his home in the Sydney suburb of Coogee in 2013 left him too frail to travel.
 A full life only took him 40 miles from his birthplace in Penrith to that beachside home close to his beloved Sydney Cricket Ground, but his voice continues to resonate around the world in the memories of millions. (Editing by ....)

Kerala reported nine fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the total number in the state to 336, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The chief minister also decried reports that some people from Uttar Pradesh's Amethi, who were stranded in Wayanad, were going hungry till Union textiles minister Smriti Irani intervened to help them. Pinarayi Vijayan said the 'Wayanad vs Amethi' pitch was an effort to portray the state in poor light."We came across some reports about Union Textiles Minister Smriti Irani's intervention to supply food to some stranded workers from her constituency Amethi in Wayanad. After intense search, we spotted them in Karuvarakund in Malappuram. On inquiry, officials found enough grocery and other items in their dwelling units," said Vijayan.He also said that these workers refused cooked food from community kitchens, saying they will cook on their own. They accepted the grocery and other items."Unlike other parts, they will not go hungry in Kerala. We consider them as our guests. Some people are not happy with our work and they give undue publicity to such wrong information," he said, adding that it was no time to score brownie points.Wayanad is represented in the Lok Sabha by Rahul Gandhi, the Congress leader who had lost the Amethi seat to BJP's Smriti Irani. Gandhi had contested last year's Lok Sabha election from two seats.The chief minister waded into the controversy after reports that 40 starving workers from Amethi stranded in Wayanad got food after Smriti Irani's intervention. It was reported that she sought help from Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan.The Congress hit back, asserting that Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi too was flooded with complaints of food shortage in Amethi and had distributed food and other essentials in his former constituency.Outlining the status of Covid-19 cases in Kerala, Vijayan said among the nine new cases that had tested positive, two were the members of Tablighi Jamaat who had returned from Delhi's Nizamuddin after attending their annual event held at the markaz (centre) last month.

The Covid-19 outbreak has forced smartphone makers to temporarily shut down their manufacturing units and retail-shop in locations across the globe. Reports in the past couple of weeks have hinted the virus outbreak could also affect future smartphone launches. But now a new report says that despite the coronavirus outbreak, Samsung's schedule for launching Galaxy Fold 2 and Galaxy Note 20 smartphones remains unaffected.
 Industry insiders told The Korea Herald that Samsung has begun preparing for the launch event of its Galaxy Fold successor and its Galaxy Note 10 successor. The event is scheduled to take place in August this year.
 However, in light of the ongoing virus outbreak, it is possible that the company could host the launch event online instead of hosting a physical event. "Preparations are underway for the upcoming Galaxy Note launch, and there is no delay," an industry insider told the publication, adding, "But regarding a physical event, things are yet to be discussed, we are considering measures like an online event."
 As far as the devices are concerned, the Galaxy Fold 2 is expected to get a 4.6-inch front display and come in 256GB and 512GB memory variants. According to a tweet by XDA Developers' Max Weinbach, the upcoming smartphone is expected to be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC and get an 8-inch display, a 108-megapixel camera, ultra thin glass, S-Pen support, along with 5G connectivity.
 The Galaxy Note 20, on the other hand, is expected to run on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor and get a screen with a 120Hz refresh rate.

Zoom has been trying to clean its mess of security and privacy issues that came up as the video conferencing app became popular. Zoom's CEO Eric Yuan hosted a livestream on YouTube which is also the debut of his weekly "Ask Eric Anything" webinar. Interested users can post questions about Zoom and Eric will answer them. This weekly webinar is part of Zoom's efforts to fix its security and privacy issues. "Eric plans to use this platform over the next 90 days to address security, privacy, data, and any other concerns from Zoom users, and we'll share highlights from each of his sessions," Zoom said in a blog post. "We have been working around the clock to ensure our users stay in touch and operational. We're also strengthening our commitment to security practices and privacy practices in this process and we're committing to this in the future as well," Eric said in his webinar address. Eric discussed issues related to zoombombing which has been the biggest concern for the video conferencing platform. Zoom had rolled out an update earlier this month which makes passwords mandatory for meeting IDs. He also advised users on how to use personal and public meeting IDs depending on the importance of the video conference. Eric also highlighted Zoom's encryption issue which had false claims. Zoom's meetings were discovered to not have end-to-end encryption as the company claimed. It later clarified saying their usage of encryption is different from other companies. But Zoom data is still decrypted at the server which gives access to the company. "Today, the way we use AES encryption, the key is generated by our system. And we're working on a feature so that the key will be generated from you, from our customers," Eric said in the webinar. Eric will be hosting another Zoom webinar next week and interested users can sign up for it here. The company also hired ex-Facebook security chief Alex Stamos to help beef up privacy and security of Zoom. Zoom will probably have to do a lot more to gain users' trust as it has already lost out among schools in the US, and Google just banned the desktop app from its employees.

There is no “The buck stops here,” like the sign once found on President Harry S. Truman’s desk.
 “George H.W. Bush used to say that no one wants to hear the president of the United States say, ‘Oh, woe is me.’ And yet Trump is betting on the reverse,” said presidential historian Jon Meacham. ”Since ancient times, leadership has been about wearing a mask of command. Trump is the opposite — a bundle of insecurities, neediness and wants.”
 Trump allies point to the president's actions — such as suspending direct flights with China and, later, Europe — as measures that kept the nation safe and said that his brashness and sense of urgency have improved the response by both the government and the private sector.
 “A big part of the reason why President Trump was elected was to be that bull in the china shop, to take those brash, declarative actions," said Jason Miller, Trump's 2016 campaign communications director. “He was elected because we are a ‘right now' society, and he will be rewarded by voters for doing whatever it takes to keep people safe."
 But from the pandemic’s first days, Trump has tried to create some daylight between the White House and the front lines of the pandemic. His administration put the onus on states to battle the crisis, declaring that the federal government — and the national stockpile of emergency medical supplies — was simply a “backstop” to the states’ efforts.
 Trump was initially reluctant to invoke the Defense Production Act, which shifts more power to Washington to push the private sector to manufacture critically needed supplies.
 Trump initially was loath to criticize China, a valued trading partner, but shifted gears with an eye toward firing up his nationalist supporters, using the inflammatory term “the Chinese virus” to describe the novel coronavirus while accusing Beijing of not being transparent with its health data. This week, he took aim at a new target, the World Health Organization, accusing it of “missing the call” on the virus.
 And, as he often does, Trump has leveled many of his broadsides at the media, attacking news organizations and individual reporters alike in an effort to boost his base supporters and cast doubt on the integrity of the reporting as bad headlines pile up.
 Trump has used this playbook before.
 Trump most notably dug in after he was accused of pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a political foe, a matter that led to his impeachment. Throughout the impeachment drama, Trump insisted his July 2019 conversation with Ukraine’s president that was at the heart of the matter was “perfect."

Non solo con le donazioni, ma grazie alla duttilità e alla velocità che sono parti fondamentali del sistema ha saputo trasformarsi per rispondere alle nuove e pressanti esigenze di sicurezza (mascherine, camici monouso, disinfettanti). In questo momento sento più forte che mai la responsabilità del mio ruolo e di quello che rappresento. Rispetto, inclusività, eguaglianza, cura dei valori che sono parte integrante del mio modo di lavorare e del mio progetto devono guidarmi in tutte le mie azioni e diventare esempio. La moda è un progetto corale che procede grazie a una ricerca della qualità che include l’etica condivisa a tutti i livelli. La manifattura italiana è una parte straordinaria di questo progetto globale. Io ho sempre voluto mantenere un rapporto diretto con questa realtà che mi aiuta a focalizzare meglio il mio progetto. Sono italiana e mi viene naturale lavorare sulle qualità costruttive e sui materiali che definiscono le mie collezioni. La disponibilità e l’intelligenza creativa con cui mi confronto a tutti i livelli nelle aziende italiane – dalle più piccole alle più grandi – mi hanno dato la consapevolezza di come questo sistema possa essere uno dei motori della ripresa, come lo era stato nell’immediato secondo dopoguerra. Sono questi valori, queste qualità che appartengono a tutti i livelli del fare che ci dovranno guidare nella ricostruzione di un dopo che inevitabilmente dovrà trasformare comportamenti e ritualità che dopo questa apocalisse non avranno senso. Un dopo che dovrà comporre una geografia articolata, senza dimenticare il valore della formazione e il ruolo, nella ricerca, dei piccoli marchi indipendenti. Non dobbiamo interrogarci su come ci vestiremo, ma su come riorganizzeremo il lavoro e rafforzeremo la nostra filiera produttiva, unica al mondo, dopo questa interruzione. Come immagineremo la comunicazione e valorizzeremo la cultura della moda. Se sapremo fare tesoro di tutte quelle qualità espresse in maniera corale dal sistema moda e finalmente usciremo da stereotipi superati, potremo dare un grande contributo, noi della moda, a questo nuovo capitolo della nostra storia.

Zoom has been trying to clean its mess of security and privacy issues that came up as the video conferencing app became popular. Zoom's CEO Eric Yuan hosted a livestream on YouTube which is also the debut of his weekly "Ask Eric Anything" webinar.
 Interested users can post questions about Zoom and Eric will answer them. This weekly webinar is part of Zoom's efforts to fix its security and privacy issues. "Eric plans to use this platform over the next 90 days to address security, privacy, data, and any other concerns from Zoom users, and we'll share highlights from each of his sessions," Zoom said in a blog post.
 "We have been working around the clock to ensure our users stay in touch and operational. We're also strengthening our commitment to security practices and privacy practices in this process and we're committing to this in the future as well," Eric said in his webinar address.
 Eric discussed issues related to zoombombing which has been the biggest concern for the video conferencing platform. Zoom had rolled out an update earlier this month which makes passwords mandatory for meeting IDs. He also advised users on how to use personal and public meeting IDs depending on the importance of the video conference.
 Eric also highlighted Zoom's encryption issue which had false claims. Zoom's meetings were discovered to not have end-to-end encryption as the company claimed. It later clarified saying their usage of encryption is different from other companies. But Zoom data is still decrypted at the server which gives access to the company.
 "Today, the way we use AES encryption, the key is generated by our system. And we're working on a feature so that the key will be generated from you, from our customers," Eric said in the webinar.
 Eric will be hosting another Zoom webinar next week and interested users can sign up for it here. The company also hired ex-Facebook security chief Alex Stamos to help beef up privacy and security of Zoom. Zoom will probably have to do a lot more to gain users' trust as it has already lost out among schools in the US, and Google just banned the desktop app from its employees.

A telltale sign of spring's arrival is seeing the crew preparing the U.S. Brig Niagara for another season of sail training, public days sails and school- group sails.
   
 April typically is when the Niagara's crew installs more than 6 miles of rigging on Erie's iconic flagship. They set up masts and yards, tie on sails, load safety and engineering equipment and perform dockside training.
   
 Many people find it a thrill when the Niagara sets sail for the first time each spring.
   
 I've seen motorists stop their vehicles along Erie's bayfront, jump out and feverishly snap photos on their cell phones.
   
 You also see people standing atop bayfront bluffs waving at the crew. Others line the North and South piers and get a close-up view as the Niagara sails from Presque Isle Bay into Lake Erie.
   
 Three weeks ago, Flagship Niagara League officials announced the delay of the Niagara's sailing season until at least August because of COVID-19 concerns.
   
 "It's frustrating, but when you look at what is happening locally, regionally and nationally with the coronavirus, I'm not too upset that we won't be getting underway," said Billy Sabatini, the Flagship Niagara League's executive director and fleet captain.
   
 "A lot of people are facing incredible hardship, and my heart goes out to all the people who are still going to work every day," Sabatini said. "We need to focus on the basic human services, and the basic functions of life should be taken care of. Once we can sail again, we'll get out there and give people something to look forward to and something to believe in. Everybody's safety is what I'm most concerned with."
   
 As a sail-training vessel under U.S. Coast guard inspection, the Niagara is required to be inspected out of the water twice in a five-year period, with no inspection interval exceeding three years.
   
 The vessel's last such inspection occurred at the end of the 2016 sailing season at Cleveland's Great Lakes Towing Co. shipyard.
   
 Sabatini tentatively plans to have the Niagara sail to Cleveland in July for what is expected to be a 10-day mandated inspection. No major repairs are necessary.
   
 After that, he hopes Niagara can salvage what remains of the sailing season with two Great Lakes sail-training voyages before spending most of September offering public and school-group sails.
   
 While the Niagara remains anchored until late summer, plans are to keep Erie's other tall ship fully operational this season.
   
 For the past two summers, the Lettie G. Howard has provided the Erie community with public day sails, school-group sails, sunset sails and private sails when the Niagara is away for much of the summer on its Great Lakes sail-training programs.
   
 A programmatic collaboration between the Flagship Niagara League and the New York City-based South Street Seaport Museum, which owns the Lettie, has been in place since February 2018.
   
 Sabatini hopes the Lettie's season can begin in June.
   
 "With the Lettie here, we always have a tall ship on the water every night," Sabatini said. "She's beautiful and she gives an enhanced view of the bay. Niagara is iconic and the symbol of Erie. Having Lettie is giving new life to that iconic image of what tall ships are. Having Lettie in Erie is only going to make the bayfront a better place."

WAPELLO -- Louisa County employees should continue to draw their full pay if they are unable to work because of a suspected COVID-19 infection, the board of supervisors agreed Tuesday.
   
 During a meeting that was held electronically because of the pandemic, the supervisors received an update on the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act from Paul Greufe, the county's human resources consultant.
   
 Greufe pointed out the new law required employers to pay two-thirds of an employee's salary for two weeks if that employee was unable to work because of the viral outbreak.
   
 However, he also outlined a range of options other counties he provides consulting services for have taken.
   
 "(The county) can go with the federal standards; pay hundred percent for the two weeks; or tap into our own sick leave to get to one hundred percent," he explained to the supervisors and several department heads who also electronically attended the meeting.
   
 Greufe indicated there was no clear consensus between the counties.
   
 "Each county is different," he said, reminding the officials whatever option was picked would only last through the end of the year.
   
 He also said it appeared the federal government planned to reimburse for the lost time, but those details needed to be worked out.
   
 "(We're) unsure what that will look like," he said.
   
 Although no county employees have apparently missed work because of a COVID-19 infection, supervisor Brad Quigley suggested that could happen.
   
 "It seems like a matter of time before we have something," he said.
   
 Quigley eventually moved to utilize the federal funding to pay for two-thirds of an employee's salary, with the county covering the remaining one-third. Supervisors Randy Griffin seconded the motion and supervisor chair Chris Ball joined them in the unanimous vote.
   
 To qualify for the pay, employees will need to have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, be advised by their medical provider that they are showing symptoms of the disease or meet other requirements of the federal act.
   
 Meanwhile, the supervisors learned that county department heads would handle the outbreak with different procedures. County treasurer Vicki Frank and auditor Sandi Elliott reported they had shifted their staffs' schedules so the employees were not in the office at the same time.
   
 Frank indicated she was going on a weekly schedule, while Elliott said her shifts were every other day. Although that means some staff will be out of the office, the officials said they could be contacted if needed and in other cases would have work they could do from home.
   
 Assistant county engineer Adam Shutt wondered how he should respond to his staff questioning why some county employees would continue to draw their full pay, although not working a full shift, while other employees continued to put in a full 40-hour work week.
   
 "Fairness has to be set aside," Louisa County Public Health Service Administrator Roxanne Smith replied, explaining people needed to stay separated as much as possible to reduce the potential spread of the virus.
   
 In other action, the supervisors approved the 2020-21 law enforcement contracts with Letts, Oakville, Grandview and Morning Sun. There was no change from the 2019-2020 contracts.
   
 New ambulance contracts with the Wapello Community Ambulance Service, Morning Sun Ambulance Service and Louisa County Ambulance Service were also approved.
   
 In final action, the supervisors:
   
 •Tabled discussion on a resignation letter from county engineer Larry Roehl;
   
 •Approved the five-year secondary roads' plan;
   
 •Appointed Ball to the conservation board, replacing Griffin.

Oil prices have been even more volatile than stocks recently as Russia and Saudi Arabia bicker over production levels as demand withers. Oil producers are set to meet on Thursday, and an announcement for production cuts to prop up the price of crude is possible.
 “The icing on the cake, ... a ‘good’ outcome for oil prices from the OPEC+ meeting, would be a global agreement to cut output ... beyond OPEC and Russia, although demand concerns will persist," Innes said.
 Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 82 cents to $25.92 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange early Thursday. It gained $1.46, or 6.2%, to settle at $25.09 a barrel on Wednesday, recovering some of its 9.4% slide from the day before.
 Brent crude oil, the international standard, rose 62 cents to $33.46 per barrel. It gained 97 cents, or 3%, to $32.84 a barrel in London.
 In currency trading, the dollar fetched 108.91 Japanese yen, up from 108.84 yen on Wednesday. The euro sold for $1.0858, little changed from $1.0856.
 Many analysts say they’re skeptical of the recent stock rally given how much uncertainty still remains. The death toll continues to rise, millions of people are still losing their jobs by the week and the economic pain is worldwide.
 But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert, raised hopes when he said the White House is working on plans to eventually reopen the country. President Donald Trump later said it “will be sooner rather than later.”
 The S&P 500 climbed 3.4% to 2,749.98. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 3.4%, to 23,433.57. The Nasdaq added 2.6% to 8,090.90.
 Stocks that have been beaten down the most since the sell-off began in February helped lead the way, including energy companies, retailers and travel-related companies.
 Shares of health insurers and other stocks got an extra boost after Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign. Investors had been wary of Sanders’ proposal of “Medicare For All” and other plans that could have restricted profits.
 Treasury yields, which signalled worries about the economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak earlier than the stock market, were relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 0.75%, from 0.76% late Wednesday.
 Nearly 1.5 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed around the world, with more than 432,000 of them in the United States. More than 88,000 people have died from the virus, while nearly 330,000 have recovered, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California will spend nearly $1 billion to purchase up to 200 million masks a month to boost the state's stockpile of protective equipment during the COVID-19 outbreak and could act as a supplier to other Western states, Gov. Gavin Newsom said.
 "We've been competing against other states, against other nations, against our own federal government'' for personal protective equipment, Newsom said Tuesday night on Rachel Maddow's MSNBC show. "We decided enough is enough."
 He said the state has signed multiple contracts with an unidentified consortium of nonprofits and a California-based manufacturer to obtain the masks, which will be made overseas.
 The order will include about 150 million N95 masks, which are tight-fitting and designed to protect against particles in the air. The other 50 million masks will be surgical masks, which are loose-fitting and protect against fluids.
 "We're going to see supplies at that level into the state of California and potentially the opportunity to export some of those supplies to states in need," Newsom said.
 California taxpayers will pay $495 million upfront for the masks. The state will pay more as other shipments arrive, with a total estimated payment of $990 million, according to a letter the Newsom administration sent to the Legislature.
 The money is coming from a portion of the $1 billion aid package the Legislature approved last month, plus another $1.3 billion disaster response emergency fund.
 California has already ordered $1.4 billion worth of personal protective equipment and distributed 41.4 million N95 masks. But the state has had trouble finding enough masks to meet the needs of its nearly 40 million residents. One shipment from Texas had to be sent back because the masks carried mold, Newsom said.
 Newsom said the state has been unable to rely on the federal government, which has sent the state about a million masks so far.
 "That's not an indictment, not a cheap shot. At the end of the day, they don't have the masks at the national stockpile," Newsom said.
 California has more than 17,600 COVID-19 cases and has seen more than 450 deaths, according to data complied by Johns Hopkins University. Intensive care hospitalizations have been growing at a slower rate than experts had anticipated, leading Newsom to donate 500 ventilators to other states.
