If this is happening in what I and many others think of an inclusive and safe bubble, I can assure you it's happening in your theater communities too. And not just in colleges, but in every aspect of the industry. And why are we just beginning to learn about it now? For the same reasons my friend who is now graduating was too scared to hold her professor accountable for the blatant racism he had exhibited during her entire college experience. White privilege gives many the power to hand out opportunities that can make or break one's career. In the past week, I've heard many Black Broadway artists speak out just now for the first time about their experiences with racism. I love Broadway, do not get me wrong. But, similarly to Northwestern, there are flaws in the system. The flaws in the industry begin with the flaws in our education system. Our educational theater programs need to do better to fill these classes with POC and specifically members of the Black community.

Bodji has lived in Clichy-sous-Bois together with her husband and her four children, aged six, 10, 13 and 18, since 2005. That was the year when angry rioters took to the streets and set cars on fire - first here, and then in the other banlieues around Paris before spreading to the rest of the country. The violent protests focused minds in the government and the rundown housing projects were renovated. But unemployment and a lousy healthcare infrastructure have persisted.
 Originally from Cote d’Ivoire, Bodji spent the last eight weeks living with her family in a 65-square-meter (700-square-foot) apartment. Relative to others, the family didn't suffer too badly. Her husband was able to continue working as a security guard, even during the lockdown, and she’s planning to start working again as a cleaner. But since everything has become more expensive, she says, the money they make will no longer be enough to make ends meet. Which is why she is now making her second trip to the food bank.

It's not surprising that some of opera's most beloved canonical works struggle to find relevance with contemporary audiences due to racist elements that we cannot and should not ignore. But race and opera is more complicated than simply addressing repertoire from the past. The way opera is produced today often continues to reinforce racist stereotypes and practices that we must face head-on if opera is truly to represent the world we live in, and for opera companies to create equitable, diverse, and inclusive homes for artists and audiences alike. This symposium will explore a number of issues including racial representation in the canonical repertoire; production practices including blackface, yellowface, and stereotypical physicalizations associated with certain ethnic groups; casting and staffing within opera houses; and the development of new works.

First, I spoke to Canopy Growth's David Klein, who discussed how he hopes to turn things around at the cannabis giant. He told me he's going to cut costs at the company -- he's expecting further headcount reductions -- and he also predicted the US federal government would have a "federally permissible" path for the cannabis industry by 2022, allowing Canopy to close on its deal to take over US cannabis company Acreage Holdings.
 That doesn't mean legalization. It'll be a narrow bill that would allow companies that sell or cultivate THC in the US to list on major exchanges, and access banking and the other nuts-and-bolts of doing business, he predicted.
 Second, Yeji profiled the first investment bank analyst dedicated to psychedelic medicine. Ammar Shah, the analyst, told Yeji that psychedelics startups are battling for a piece of the $100 billion mental health market. You can bet investment banks will want their share of those fees when these companies inevitably consolidate and go public.
