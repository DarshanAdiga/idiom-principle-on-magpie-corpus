  The CDSA staff has been busy throughout the pandemic, contacting all 268 Northwest Oklahoma child care facilities each week to assess needs.


  Cleaning supplies have been a growing need for day care staff, as supplies in some areas have dwindled, due to the need to sanitize surfaces more thoroughly and more frequently to prevent spread of the coronavirus.

Many more small practices are struggling behind the scenes. And these small practices — already on the ropes thanks to economic pressures that pre-date the pandemic — play a key role in our health care system. They are often in the neighborhoods that they serve, which means they are easier to access on a day-to-day basis. They typically provide primary care — they are the first doctors we see when we are sick and the doctors who monitor us on a regular basis to make sure we stay healthy. Small practices also provide a level of personal interaction that so often feels missing in modern medicine — and in modern life in general.

Yes. Just to give some additional color around the portfolio. We have seen a pretty significant shift mainly driven by the businesses that are that have the ability to remain open because all other businesses were required to remain closed. So we are seeing a significant shift toward supermarkets, pharmacies and gas stations, mainly as those are the "essential businesses" that could continue to do business throughout this period. And what the other important or, I guess, key factor to consider is we're also seeing an increase in the average ticket. So although these are, as I mentioned in the script, lower-margin businesses, we are seeing the average ticket come up or at least that's what we saw in these past few weeks as people go out to the supermarket and make larger purchases so that they can stay within their homes for a longer period of time.

 "How can the long-term future of clubs be determined under these fundamentally changed conditions? How is there any semblance of fairness? To wave aside all the fears and concerns is too simplistic.
 "Surely all 20 clubs must agree the fairest way forward to complete the season?" A 14-6 majority of would, however be enough for Project Restart to be put into action.
 \- 'Is this fair?' - Duxbury also insisted it was wrong to play matches when society was "probably still facing the kind of restrictions unenforceable on a football pitch".
 "And with all these compromises and health risks we are asked to finish a competition that bears no resemblance to the one we started, which could end a small club like Watford's time in the Premier League.
 "So is this fair? Does it have any semblance of sporting integrity? Of course not." The Premier League is facing a colossal estimated loss of around 1 billion Pounds ($1.25 billion) if no more football is played this season.
 Playing the 92 remaining games behind closed doors would mitigate that loss, avoiding the loss of hundreds of millions of broadcast revenue.

All Business to look for day jobs
 It was a beautiful spring day as All Business met the Hardy Hurlers on the field of battle for a 1 p.m. start time in the West Plains Daily Quill Fantastic Fantasy League game of the week.
 Both teams already had one loss under their belt, and were really feeling the weight of the pressure to put up a “W”.
 As the tournament comes down to the wire, there is no room for error. The winner takes it all, and the loser is just dust in the wind.
 Fingerless Jim was slinging the hardball for the Hardy Hurlers. He allowed a pair of base hits, but they were left stranded on base. The Hurlers managed to get 1 run on the scoreboard in the bottom of the first when Muskrat hit a double to drive Righty Jones home.
 The second inning went six up and six down.
 In the bottom of the third inning Lefty Jones jacked a 3-run homer to take the Hurlers’ lead to 4-0, and they were on the sunny side of the street, but soon they would be walking in the shade with their blues on parade.
 In the top of the fourth, Ozark Auto slammed a 3-run homer to pull All Business to within 1, then back to back solo shot homers from The Firm and ABC Carpet sent All Business out front.
 The home runs were flying so fast it felt like watching the juiced up Bash Brothers—Mark McGuire and Jose Canseco- of the Oakland A’s back in the ‘90s.
 Each side put up another solo homer on either end of the seventh inning stretch, and All Business headed into ninth with a 1 run lead. The Hurlers retired the side in order, and All Business had to rely on the strength of their defense to pull off a win. Fish Shack was under pressure on the mound to deliver a win.
 Fish Shack winds up and fires, and Righty Jones ripped the cover off the ball with with a long shot that went yard to tie the game. Next up was Musty Basement. Catcher ISF called for slider, but Fish Shack shook it off, and opted for the fastball. He should have listened to what the man said because that turned out to be Fish Shack’s last pitch of the season, when Basement put it squarely in the outfield bleachers.
 After seemingly having the game locked down All Business was left dazed and confused by the sudden turn of events that left them outside of the tournament bracket.
 The Hardy Hurlers didn’t have time for a celebration, because they had to face the River Rats the following day to wrap up the losers’ bracket.
 The karma police were out in full force at the next day’s games. Home runs won the Hurlers’ previous game, but home runs lost this days game. River Rats jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first inning, and never looked back.
 The Hardy Hurlers will go back home, and the River Rats will go on to meet the Paperbacks in the championship battle of evermore.
 The Paperbacks need only one win to be crowned champions, but since the Hurlers already have one loss under their belt they will have to defeat the Paperbacks twice.

A large Fontana church is making plans to hold services in its building later this month, even though Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that the state's churches should remain closed at this time for health reasons because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Water of Life Community Church in Fontana is in the forefront of a movement which includes dozens of California evangelical Christian churches of various sizes that want to open for in-person services during the weekend of May 30-31.
 Water of Life Pastor Dan Carroll spoke at a press conference at his church on May 7, saying that the coalition, calling itself Church United, has decided to move forward with the process of re-opening.
 "We think we have a great plan that is very safe and will protect our people," Carroll said. "We love our people. We don't want our people to come back to church and get sick, we want people to come back to church and get well."
 Newsom has maintained that religious services, which have been closed down since March, should only return during Stage 3 of his plan to slowly re-open the state. Newsom announced that Stage 2, which opened certain businesses, was beginning on May 8 and he did not specify when Stage 3 could start.
 Carroll said he was glad that Newsom was willing to engage the churches in discussions.
 "We're not here to be activists, we're not here to be rebels, we're here to be helpers. That is the primary focus of all of our hearts," Carroll said.
 Nevertheless, he and other pastors who attended the press conference said they believe that churches have been "bypassed" in California's re-opening process and need to be included in the Phase 2 rollout.
 "They hope to do it with the governor's approval and in partnership with the administration, but many of them are prepared to roll no matter what," Carroll said.
 Water of Life and many other churches have been holding online services, but they emphasize that gathering in person is "essential."
 "We feel a bit like we've been kicked to the curb and just been deemed as nonessential when we're feeding the poor -- we fed nearly 10,000 people this week out of our food warehouse; we're caring for those who are struggling with sexual addiction, drug addition, grieving classes, alcohol addiction -- and those people have all been marginalized and disenfranchised during the discussion," Carroll said.
 Carroll said Water of Life, regarded as one of the 100 largest evangelical churches in the nation, has more than 20,000 attendees.
 He said that Newsom told him that church services were similar in some respects to professional sports events (such as Major League Baseball games), which Newsom believes could create circumstances which spread COVID-19. Large- scale sports events are slated to be permitted only during the final phase (Stage 4).
 Carroll said the Church United has been working on a strategic plan that would show that the churches could open up now and still adhere to all the necessary guidelines that health experts say must be met.
 For example, he said that Water of Life, which has a 3,300-seat auditorium, could hold several services and limit congregants to just 250 in each service. Protections would include making sure that attendees wear face coverings and do not touch other persons at any time.
 State health officials are very concerned about the possibility of a repeat of a coronavirus outbreak at a Sacramento-area church earlier this year in which more than 70 people were infected.
 Church United said that it would be appropriate for churches to re-open on May 31 because that day is being celebrated this year as the Day of Pentecost, which is considered significant by Christians because it is when Jesus Christ's apostles received the Holy Spirit, according to the Book of Acts in the Bible.
 \----- DURING a separate press conference involving San Bernardino County officials on May 8, Supervisor Curt Hagman said that the county is seeking to send Newsom a comprehensive proposal that would allow for additional "low- risk" Stage 2 openings this month -- including churches.
 Hagman said the county wants to exert more local control, rather than to have to follow a statewide mandate, because the county has been effective in slowing the spread of COVID-19.
 "I'm hopeful that we can make our case," Hagman said.
