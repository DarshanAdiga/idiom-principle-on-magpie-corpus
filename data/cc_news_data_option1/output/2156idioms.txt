It made me really, really angry.
 Floyd’s death last week in Minneapolis was caught on video by nearby witnesses. The video shows white police officer Derek Chauvin, who has since been fired and charged with third degree murder and manslaughter, kneeling on the neck of Floyd, a black man, for nearly nine minutes. Three other officers, who have not yet been charged, watched on in silence as witnesses screamed for Chauvin to remove his knee from Floyd’s neck.
 Pleading that he couldn’t breathe, Floyd eventually cried out for his deceased mother before he passed. Reports indicate that Floyd was unresponsive for nearly three minutes before the officer removed his knee from Floyd’s neck.
 I say all that because it should anger everyone.
 Floyd was suspected of passing a counterfeit $20 bill.That is not a capital offense.
 Not in this country.
 Whatever the result of any potential criminal charge would have been, Floyd should still be breathing today.
 “You can’t be human and not be affected by that video,” Iowa football coach Kirk Ferentz said in a virtual team meeting with players on Monday night, a transcript of which was released by the program’s Twitter account. “I’m sure that many of you felt the same way I did — heartbroken. Frustrated. Angry.
 “There have been racial problems in this country for generations. There has been discrimination, resentment and mistrust for a long time. I hoped by now we would be better at relationships when it comes to race — but this week shows we have a long way to go.
 “I am a white football coach. I cannot begin to imagine what it is like to be pulled over for driving while black or to have people cross the street because they don’t want to walk alongside of you. … If things are going to change, it will be up to all of us as individuals to be a part of the change.”
 In the week since Floyd’s death, peaceful protests have broken out across the nation — though there has been widespread rioting and looting in larger cities. Leaders across the nation have expressed their outrage over the killing and the need for justice.
 The sports world has been no different.
 Perhaps the sports world has been more welcoming to that message.
 As many athletes can point out, the locker room becomes a melting pot — a microcosm of what America is supposed to be: people of all kinds of different backgrounds, including race, coming together for a common cause.
 Even athletes are not immune to racial profiling. A number of stories have come out in recent years of famous professional athletes being detained because they “fit the suspect’s description.”
 Imagine those who have been less fortunate and nowhere near famous — until their death.
 George Floyd was one of them. There are far too many cases to list them all in this column, but if you’ve watched the news much over the last week you’ve undoubtedly heard many of them.
 “As someone who is in a unique position to coach and mentor young men from all walks of life, I am particularly angered for my student-athletes of color,” University of Iowa basketball coach Fran McCaffery said in a statement released Monday. “We live in a country where everyday life poses a risk to them. I worry about their well-being — both physical and emotional.
 “Positive change only takes place through action. We must respect and support one another to help build a better future.”
 I was not alive the last time this nation underwent quite this kind of upheaval over civil rights, and it’s possible the scale of riots across the country will be the most destructive period of civil unrest this country has witnessed since the 1860s — when our ancestors fought a literal war against each other in part over the racial issue of slavery.
 “I’m frustrated and disappointed that we as a society are not better than this,” Wisconsin football coach Paul Chryst said. “What happened to George Floyd is unspeakable but yet all too common. Every person is important but for too long many in the black community have not been treated as such. If we are really going to affect change, then it’s going to take everyone. We need to be better, individually and collectively.”
 There have been large-scale movements across the country in the last half- century. There have been plenty of protests advocating for racial equality in just the last 10 years.
 But this time feels different. This time it feels like more and more of “white America” is waking up to the problem.
 Not everyone listened when Colin Kaepernick took a knee. More people are listening now.
 “I can’t and won’t pretend to know what it’s like to be a black person in America,” University of Wisconsin basketball coach Greg Gard said. “Speaking up and listening is important, but what matters most is finding proof in our future actions. Actions that are positive, purposeful, helpful and continue long after these current events fade.
 “As humans, we all need to be dedicated to impacting change in our own communities. We need to be dedicated to fixing our moral compasses and living and leading with empathy, respect, love and understanding for all cultures.”
 Much of the outrage of the last week has been directed at police. It’s important to note that it’s not a case where all police are bad. Far from it.
 I certainly don’t envy the job cops have to do. It can’t be easy.
 Unfortunately, even one bad apple in a police department is way too many.
 And to be silent is to be complicit.
 Dubuque’s police chief seems to get it.
 “I don’t need to know all the contributing details of that event in Minneapolis. All I need to hear is that members of my community are afraid. That my black friends say, ‘I’m afraid to let my children leave the house.’ That people in Dubuque fear the police,” Chief Mark Dalsing wrote in a post on the Dubuque Police Department’s Facebook page on Friday. “Do not try to dilute Mr. Floyd’s death by pointing to the subsequent unrest of the last couple of nights. They are separate and distinct. Let’s focus on the fact that there is still a lot to fix in society, and that includes things that need to be fixed in law enforcement.
 “As the Chief of Police of the Dubuque Police Department, I will do whatever is within my scope and control to be part of the solution.”
 I don’t know what the answer is. But we all need to be part of the solution.
 And it needs to happen now.
 Before the next heart-breaking video is recorded.

"That money is going to go and the question is: what is Australia going to do about it? All the evidence is that when you invest in research in universities, you get large economic spillovers," he said.
 "This is an impending disaster which needs to be sorted out in the next few months. Universities like my own will have to make decisions about what activities we can afford to do and what we can't. We're to lose a potential early-career researcher generation." The Group of Eight (Go8), a coalition of Australia's top universities, said that prior to the pandemic research from its members "pumped almost 25 billion AUD (17.3 billion USD) into the economy each year." "Life as we know it has changed dramatically and more than ever we need a research-led economic recovery - unashamedly focused on job creation, retraining, improved productivity processes and new industries supported by AI and hi-tech manufacturing," Go8 chief executive Vicki Thomson said.
 "COVID-19 has shone an uncomfortable light on what we have known all along - our funding system is broken, with an over-reliance on international fee income to prop up our university research - 70 per cent of which is undertaken in Go8 universities." The warnings come as La Trobe University, which has more than 25,000 students across Australia, faces bankruptcy.
 Nine Entertainment newspapers reported that La Trobe will be broke within weeks unless it can secure bank loans and an agreement with all staff on a 10 percent pay cut.
 In a briefing sent to staff on Tuesday Vice-Chancellor John Dewar said that there was "no money tucked down the back of the sofa", warning that unless staff agreed to a pay cut there would be 450 redundancies.

Heart of Missouri Girls on the Run, a local chapter of the Girls on the Run nonprofit, released a statement Tuesday condemning the "senseless murder" of Minnesotan George Floyd.
 "Four hundred years of systemic racism in this country has led to feelings of hopelessness, anger, despair and fear," the statement reads. "People are exhausted by our country’s ongoing failure to acknowledge and address centuries of deeply entrenched injustice. As a country, we can no longer stifle, deny or ignore the root cause of these painful emotions.
 "Protest is a powerful way to stand up for ourselves and others to build a better world. Now, we must come together to create lasting change that ensures life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all. I hope that we have finally reached a tipping point where true change can take place and healing can begin."
 The statement goes on to include what the organization is teaching its members, including not being a bystander but being a "standbyer," putting yourself in someone else’s shoes to develop empathy for their experiences and using our voices in ways that matter, among other values.
 According to the organization's website, it inspires its members — third- through-eighth-grade girls — to "recognize their inner strength" and "celebrate what makes them one of a kind" through a 10-week program that develops essential skills and establishes a lifetime appreciation for fitness.

ZEELAND -- Eli Van Singel and Will Fredrickson had much to accomplish in their senior seasons.
   
 Van Singel said at the end of last year, "We should roll into our senior year strong."
   
 Now, they'll never know how their last season with Zeeland lacrosse would have gone.
   
 "Being a senior and finally being in my final year was just pretty tough," Van Singel said. "Our senior class was all pretty close. Most of us have all been playing some sort of lacrosse together for 10 years.
   
 "Just having all that time together, to have that final icing on the cake or cherry on top of the season taken away was surreal -- it didn't feel real."
   
 Fredrickson said many players weren't sure how to handle having their spring seasons canceled.
   
 "A lot of us are really close outside of lacrosse and it just stinks for everyone," Fredrickson said. "We don't want to pity ourselves too much because everyone else is going through stuff right now. It's definitely hard on everyone. It's difficult when you've been playing this long and you don't really know what to do now."
   
 Van Singel and Fredrickson were The Holland Sentinel's Lacrosse Co-Players of the Year last season as juniors.
   
 Both were named all-conference last year, as Van Singel had 45 goals and 18 assists while Fredrickson had 29 goals and 20 assists.
   
 "I was hoping to get higher numbers this year," Van Singel said. "Obviously, I put a lot of work into my game during the summer and the fall, and even throughout the school year playing indoor and box lacrosse.
   
 "I was ready to get back on the field and get some high numbers."
   
 Fredrickson said the two of them were always on the same page.
   
 "I'm very familiar with all of his moves, as he is with mine, so we can just read and play off each other, do a lot of two-man game," Fredrickson said. "It makes it a lot easier when you know what he's thinking and he knows what I'm thinking.
   
 "You can go out there and just ball out."
   
 Zeeland fell to Hudsonville 6-4 in a regional semifinal last season, and both agreed a regional championship and beyond was possible in 2020.
   
 Van Singel recalls an upset victory over Spring Lake last year as a high moment, and one of the moments that makes him think about what could have been.
   
 "We beat them in a pouring-rain game, like 9-1, and it was like, 'This year was going to be our year,'" Van Singel said. "All the other schools had huge senior classes last year, we graduated like three guys."
   
 Fredrickson appreciated what all of his coaches did for him over the years, including varsity coach Todd Kamstra, assistants Nate Elzinga and Mike Kelly, middle school coach Aaron Chew and elementary coaches Marcus Deweerd and Jeremy Hoekwater.
   
 "Coach Kamstra is a great guy," Fredrickson said. "He spends a lot of time on the little things outside of lacrosse, just making us better men and honestly, I can't thank Zeeland lacrosse enough for everything they've done.
   
 "Our program as a whole is very sound. It has great leadership all throughout."
   
 Van Singel will play lacrosse at Hope next spring and Fredrickson will play club lacrosse at Michigan State. As both prepare for their first seasons in a long time not playing together, they know Zeeland prepared them for the future.
   
 "My freshman year, I was on the JV team and I got pulled up for varsity playoffs and I didn't play a minute," Van Singel said. "That was the first time in awhile I was like, 'Wow, I didn't play at all. I'm on the bench.' It taught me stuff isn't given here. Even though I'm this experienced player, I still have to work. It's not an option to do nothing and still get all the time you want."

While more countries and sectors are reopening, economic activity is expected to remain subdued as social distancing rules complicate plans to get back to business. Meanwhile, investors continue to keep an eye out for any signs that the reopening of the economy is leading to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.
 In Japan, Tokyo reported 34 newly confirmed cases on Tuesday, leading city officials to declare a largely symbolic “alert” for more social distancing. The Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo was lit red to remind residents. Before Tuesday, daily new infections had dropped below 20 recently.
 Bond yields were mostly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.71% from 0.68% late Tuesday.
 Benchmark U.S. crude added 98 cents to $37.79 a barrel. It rose $1.37 to $36.81 a barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude oil for August delivery gained 65 cents to $40.22 a barrel.
 The balance of this week will provide new data on the labor market, which has racked up huge increases in Americans who’ve lost their job as the coronavirus shutdowns left millions out of work.
 Payroll processor ADP issues its May survey of hiring by private U.S. companies on Wednesday. The weekly tally of applications for unemployment aid comes on Thursday. And on Friday, the government reports its May labor market data. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the report will show the economy lost 9 million jobs last month and that the national unemployment rate jumped to nearly 20%.
 Investors will also have their eye on a couple of companies set to go public this week. Music company Warner Music Group is set to hold its IPO on Wednesday, while business information services company ZoomInfo Technologies is scheduled to go public on Thursday.
 The U.S. dollar slipped to 108.63 Japanese yen from 108.67 yen late Tuesday. The euro climbed to $1.1207 from $1.1171.

Hogan is responsible for coordinating player development, most notably with the Panthers’ perimeter players, and is heavily involved in recruiting. He is also in charge of opponent scouting and the team’s summer camp programs.
 Hogan earned all-state accolades at Hempstead as a senior in 1995, then became a four-year letterwinner and an academic all-North Central Conference performer at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa.
 Hogan began his coaching career at Wayne State College in 1999-2000 and moved on to North Dakota State University the following season. He then spent two seasons at Southwest State University (now known as Southwest Minnesota State) and helped the team to a 38-18 record and two runner-up finishes in the Northern Sun Conference.
 CoSIDA honors area track athletes — Three Loras College seniors earned spots on the College Sports Information Directors of America academic all-District 8 women’s track and field team. They included Alexis Alt, a biology major who carried a 3.86 grade point average; Audrey Miller, a chemistry major who carried a 3.73 GPA; and Gabrielle Noland, who carried a 3.40 GPA in neuroscience, psychology and criminal justice.
 University of Wisconsin-Platteville senior Noah Steiner, who earned a 3.76 GPA in industrial technology management, made the all-District 8 men’s team. And Darlington, Wis., native Johanna Meister, a senior with a 3.87 GPA in mechanical engineering earned a spot on the all-District 8 women’s team.
 The team recognizes the nation’s top student-athletes for their combined performances on the field and in the classroom. The CoSIDA Academic All- America program separately recognizes track & field/cross country honorees in four divisions — NCAA Division I, NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III and NAIA.
 Clarke’s Wallrapp honored — The National Association of Basketball Coaches has named Clarke University assistant men’s basketball coach Charlie Wallrapp to the 2020 Under Armour 30-Under-30 Team, which recognizes 30 of the most outstanding men’s college basketball coaches under the age of 30. He serves as an assistant under head coach Jim Blaine.
 The Omaha, Neb., native was a two-time NAIA basketball All-American at Benedictine College, in Atchison, Kan. The three-time Heart of America Athletic Conference All-Conference performer finished his illustrious career as the Ravens’ 11th all-time leading scorer with 1,438 points.
 Wallrapp joined the Clarke staff in 2018 after a stint at Kansas Wesleyan University. His resume also includes stops at the AAU and high school levels.
 Heart to offer women’s wrestling — The Heart of America Athletic Conference will add women’s wrestling to the list of conference sponsored sports this fall. The addition bumps the conference’s list of sponsored sports to 22.
 Five full-time conference member institutions — Baker, Central Methodist, Grand View, Missouri Valley, and William Penn — will field the women’s wrestling teams with the potential for associate members to join at a later date. Grand View (No. 11), Missouri Valley (No. 15), and Central Methodist (No. 20) were each named in the final edition of the NAIA Women’s Wrestling Coaches’ Top 20 Poll in February.
 Women’s wrestling currently is recognized by the NAIA as an invitational sport with 28 institutions sponsoring the sport in 2019-20. The Heart will join the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference, Mid-South Conference, and Sooner Athletic Conference as NAIA leagues sponsoring women’s wrestling.

Nothing sinks a movie like predictability. But in these uncertain times, the finely-tuned comedy of "The High Note" proves a welcome retreat. Most of what works is due to a top-notch cast exuding charm, good looks and just enough musical ability to strike a delightful chord. It's pitch-perfect, light- hearted entertainment for COVID-weary eyes - and ears.
 The scene is the glitzy world of L.A.'s recording industry. Cue a ton of establishing shots of the iconic cylindrical Capitol Records building. Inside, we find Maggie (Dakota Johnson), the put-upon personal assistant to Grace Davis, the demanding diva played by Tracee Ellis Ross ("Black-ish"). You'd be correct in thinking it's a redo of "The Devil Wears Prada," except "The High Note" is not as mean-spirited, but it does share the killer wardrobe.
 Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to PatriotLedger.com to sign up for alerts and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.
 The daughter of a disc jockey, Maggie loves Aretha Franklin and Sam Cooke and is a walking encyclopedia of music history. She wants to be a producer but is stuck picking up dry-cleaning, booking private jets and stirring green smoothies. All this while Grace's record company and manager (a snarling and scowling Ice Cube - is there any other?) conspire to put the aging star out to pasture with a Las Vegas residency. Except, Grace isn't going anywhere until she fulfills her desire to cut a new album - her first in a decade.
 Kelvin Harrison Jr. ("Waves," "Luce") is Maggie's first musical discovery. They meet cute at a grocery store. Soon, she's producing his debut album - on the sly from Grace, of course. As expected, Maggie runs herself ragged. Her two worlds eventually collide into a quagmire. You know how it goes. Egos are bruised and fallout is inevitable. It's the same old song. But, Johnson as the rising star and Ross doing her own singing as the superstar (think: a lighter version of her legendary mother, Diana Ross) are an inspired pairing. Their likability goes a long way in sustaining the predictable story.
 Nisha Ganatra (the underrated "Late Night") directs with a sure hand from a script by Flora Greeson that weaves the conflicts of both women together into a whole lot of self-empowerment. Greeson's script also calls out the music industry over its long-standing practices of ageism and sexism, which is something to sing about. Plus, there's some romance, some fun songs, a few laughs and a big 'ol twist that isn't as surprising as the filmmakers might think. But whatever - all the parts blend into harmony thanks to Johnson's immense every-woman appeal and Ellis Ross's knack at being a diva with a heart of gold.
 An amusing lineup of supporting players provides enough laughs to keep the movie bopping along. Zoe Chao is Maggie's BFF, the always reliable Bill Pullman is her doting dad, June Diane Raphael ("Long Shot") is Grace's loony house manager, and British comic Eddie Izzard makes a brief cameo.
 The film was originally scheduled to open in theaters two weeks ago, but will instead open Friday as a video on demand for a $20 rental fee. Sounds steep, but it's worth it once you consider what you'd pay for tickets and popcorn in a theater. It's like getting it for a song.

Epelbaum, che possiede anche diverse sale cinematografiche a Berna, a Bienne e nella Svizzera romanda, ci spiega per telefono che dopo alcuni giorni in cui nessuno sapeva come affrontare la questione del personale, "è diventato chiaro abbastanza rapidamente che tutti i nostri dipendenti potevano ricorrere al lavoro ridotto". Questo meccanismo di lavoro a orario ridotto consente ai dipendenti di lavorare a una percentuale inferiore, mentre il loro datore di lavoro versa un salario inferiore che viene integrato dall'assicurazione contro la disoccupazione.
 Epelbaum ha anche ottenuto - "velocemente e senza intoppi" - un prestito a tasso zero. Tuttavia, sottolinea, benché il prestito sia stato "molto apprezzato e lo è tuttora", non si tratta di un sussidio. "In questo momento aiuta a coprire il resto degli stipendi e a pagare le bollette. Ma si tratta di un prestito che a un certo punto dovrà essere restituito. Questo è abbastanza preoccupante perché finora i cinema non hanno ricevuto altro denaro al di fuori del prestito e del lavoro ridotto".

It’s hot, and we get that you don’t want your hair in your face. But tight buns or ponytails aren’t the way to go. Extremely tight ponytails put a lot of stress and tension on your hair strands and cause more breakage especially around the hairline. I can’t tell you to completely avoid tying your hair in a ponytail but go for a loose one. Or even better tie a bun and then use an old scarf around your head like a turban. That will keep your hair safe and out of your face in this heat. If you HAVE to tie a tight ponytail for some reason, then you make sure you use a ponytail friendly crease-less elastic and try and massage your scalp once you take the ponytail out.

WEYMOUTH - Construction of a new $33 million Tufts Library has resumed, and the grand opening for the facility should occur in September.
 Mayor Robert Hedlund said construction has returned to "full speed" since it halted in late March under a statewide emergency order prohibiting work on "non-essential" projects because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "We are back on a full-time line schedule that allows us to say that September is when it should be completed," he said.
 The two-story building was scheduled to be finished by CTA Construction in early June.
 Work at the site began to slow down after the Massachusetts Building Trade Council requested its members to stop working at various job sites around New England to avoid contracting the coronavirus.
 The work stoppage was compounded under an emergency order by Gov. Charlie Baker on March 23 which deemed the library construction was not an essential project.
 A recent easing of the emergency order by Baker has allowed work at the site to resume.
 Hedlund said the construction delay has resulted in some cost overruns which are "up in the air.
 "A delay like that would cost some additional costs," he said. "But we don't believe at this point that the town would bear those costs. It's not the town that caused the delay."
 Hedlund said his administration is starting discussions with CTA Construction about the additional expenses incurred by the delay.
 "I don't believe the cost overruns are too bad," he said. "I don't have any (cost overrun) numbers yet, because discussions have not taken place yet."
 Construction of the new library had been underway since May 2019, a month after the 53-year-old former Tufts was demolished.
 Town council approved a $33 million bond for financing the construction of a 50,000 square-foot facility at Hedlund's request in October 2017.
 The overall expense was reduced by a $12.1 million grant secured from the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners from State Sen. Patrick O'Connor, R-Weymouth, and State Rep. James Murphy, D-Weymouth.
 Town officials broke ground in March 2019, and Tappe Architects of Boston completed the building design.
 The new library will have a large lobby with a cafe for patrons to read a newspaper or periodical.
 Tappe Architects' design has a digital media lab with updated computed software, five community meeting rooms to accommodate small or large gatherings, an adult reading area, a large children's section, and a place designated for teen activities.
 There also will be a large outdoor amphitheater for hosting movie nights or small theater group performances.
 Patrons will enjoy a spacious view of Weston Park, which underwent a $1.5 million renovation in 2018-2019.
 These features are just some of the reasons why the library staff expects there will be an increase in the number of people applying for a library card and using the facility.
 The staff urges would-be patrons to immediately apply for a library card online to avoid waiting in long lines when Tufts opens in September.
 Residents can get a temporary pass or e-card online through the Old Library Network website at OCLN.org.

Michael enjoyed an intimate relationship with music for more than sixty years, sharing that relationship with students at the Jacobs School of Music for seventeen of those years. Internationally known as a virtuoso on the baroque bassoon, with some 140 recordings in his discography, Michael is mentioned in the standard reference work on classical music as a notable performer and teacher of our time. However, his impressive professional credentials do not even begin to capture the essence of Michael McCraw. For that, one must also take into account the outgoing, larger than life personality and convivial lifestyle that render him unforgettable to musicians everywhere, not to mention publicans, servers, and restaurateurs from Bloomington to Barcelona, Charleston to Cologne, and Toronto to Turin.  
 Offspring of a fiddler and banjo picker in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Michael learned to read music at the age of five singing shape note hymns in a rural church. In his childhood, he had piano lessons, then took up the clarinet and in his senior year of high school, Michael began to play the bassoon. After starting a music education degree in college, Michael realized that he wanted to pursue performance seriously, so he transferred to the recently opened North Carolina School of the Arts. He went to New York City after he graduated to pursue further studies and quickly became an active freelance musician. It was there, in the heady days of the early 1970s, that Michael and I became friends, undertaking exploits that would be completely inappropriate to recount on this occasion.
