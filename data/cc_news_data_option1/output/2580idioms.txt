Margot Robbie’s _Pirates_ movie is said to be “a wholly original story with new characters under the _Pirates_ moniker,” that is separate from another movie from the franchise which is in the works under _Chernobyl_ writer Craig Mazin and _Pirates_ alum Ted Elliot. Both projects are being overseen by producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who has been part of the franchise since the beginning. Other details are thin on Margot Robbie boarding a new movie based on the classic Disneyland ride, but the news does raise questions about the future of the _Birds of Prey_ franchise. Let’s talk it out.

The key point of worry _Birds of Prey_ fans can clearly note from the _Pirates of the Caribbean_ news is both the star and writer from the early 2020 film are attached to the upcoming Disney film. The latest DCEU flick was released over five months ago – you'd think we would have heard something about the followup if it was happening shortly after. Instead, we’re hearing about a completely new project from the pair. Now we don’t know about internal plans of the if/when of _Birds of Prey 2_, but the fact that Christina Hodson and Margot Robbie have gone as far as to jump studios to work on something completely new could indicate a move back to the drawing board.

If this _Pirates_ movie does well, down the line, audiences might be warmer on checking out _Birds of Prey_ , and it could see new life yet. Another byproduct of the _Pirates_ news is perhaps the film hiring some of the cast from _Birds of Prey_ to board the ship with the Harley Quinn actress. If a sequel for the DC movie is dead in the water, Christina Hodson’s take on the material could leave room for it to spiritually live through a more mainstream title.

Cricket Australia has put its Dukes ball experiment on ice, deciding to use Kookaburra throughout the coming Sheffield Shield season as it seeks to help spinners develop.
 CA had used a Dukes ball in the second half of Shield seasons since 2016-17, wanting players to prepare for the same pill they would encounter if selected on an Ashes tour.
 The ploy was one of many pieces of the puzzle that helped Australia retain the Ashes in 2019, a feat that no Australian team had accomplished in England since 2001.
 It is likely the British ball will be used again in Australia's first-class competition whenever attention shifts to the Ashes tour that is currently scheduled for 2023.
 CA's head of cricket operations Peter Roach noted "we see a definite opportunity to reintroduce the Dukes ball at some stage in the future", but for now CA will stick with Kookaburra.
 "The introduction of the Dukes ball has been a worthwhile exercise ... we have been happy with how the ball has performed when used in Australian conditions over the past four seasons," Roach said.
 ""We do, however, feel that reverting to one ball for 2020-21 will provide the consistent examination of our players over a full season that CA and the states are presently seeking.
 "The Kookaburra is the ball used for international cricket in Australia and many parts of the world."
 Roach added that spinners in the "Sheffield Shield have been playing less of a role in recent seasons, most notably in games when the Dukes ball is in use".
 "We need spinners bowling in first-class cricket and we need our batters facing spin," he said.
 "We hope that the change to one ball with have a positive benefit here."

A physical release of the series isn't entirely out of the picture, as another iconic horror host, Elvira, has released multiple volumes of her _Elvira's Movie Macabre_ over the years, but with Briggs' tenure on _MonsterVision_ consisting of hundreds of titles, it would seem like a difficult endeavor to release so many episodes on physical media. However, his comments specifically addressing DVDs paired with the remark "something official" might lead us to believe he's specifically referencing such a release.


  Whatever the future might hold for _MonsterVision_ , Briggs fans still have the opportunity to tune in to two seasons of _The Last Drive-In withJoe Bob Briggs_ on Shudder, in addition to multiple of the host's specials on the streaming service. After more than 15 years off the air, Briggs returned in 2018 to host a 24-hour marathon that was meant to serve as a send-off for the host. The event was so popular, Shudder enlisted Briggs not only for more specials, but also his own weekly series of double features. In fact, due to that positive relationship between the platform and the host, we wouldn't be surprised to see select seasons of _MonsterVision_ be made available on the service.

The tour said after several asymptomatic positive tests that were followed by a negative test, it consulted with the CDC and is moving to a test-based model, which allows players or caddies to return if they have two negative tests at least 24 hours apart. Previously, the tour relied on time-based protocols that required those who test positive to self-isolate for at least 10 days.

"I did spend a lot of time with Donald before he became president," said Widdicombe. "I interviewed the kids several times and I've met all his wives. The thing about Donald is what you see is what you get. A lot of my Australian relatives want to know what Donald Trump is like. The only answer to that is he's like what he's like on television. There's no hidden layer. He is completely one dimensional and what you see is what you get. He certainly was ahead of the curve in adopting tactics to his spectacular benefit."

Russians have opened the door to Vladimir Putin staying in power until 2036 by voting overwhelmingly for constitutional changes that will allow him to run again for president twice, but critics said the outcome was falsified on an industrial scale.
 Official results, after 98 per cent of ballots had been counted, showed that the former KGB officer who has ruled Russia for more than two decades had easily won the right to run for two more six-year terms after the current one ends in 2024.
 That means Putin, 67, could rule until the age of 83.
 The Central Election Commission said 78 per cent of votes counted across the world's largest country had supported changing the constitution. Just over 21 per cent had voted against, it said.
 Ella Pamfilova, head of the commission, said the vote had been transparent and that officials had done everything to ensure its integrity.
 But opposition politician Alexei Navalny called the vote an illegitimate and illegal show designed to legalise Putin's presidency for life.
 "We'll never recognise this result," Navalny told supporters in a video.
 Navalny said the opposition would not protest for now because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, but would do so in big numbers in the autumn if its candidates were blocked from taking part in regional elections or their results were falsified.
 "What Putin fears most is the street," said Navalny. "He... will not leave until we start to take to the streets in the hundreds of thousands and in the millions."
 Russians had been encouraged to back Putin's power move, described by critics as a constitutional coup, with prize draws offering flats and an ad campaign highlighting other constitutional amendments in the same reform bundle, such as pensions protection and a de facto ban on same-sex marriages.
 One-off payments of 10,000 roubles were transferred to those with children at Putin's order as people headed to polling stations on Wednesday, the last day of the vote, held over seven days to try to limit the spread of the virus.
 Turnout was 65 per cent, election officials said.
 Putin, already the longest-serving leader in modern Russian history since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, made no mention of how the changes could affect his own career in an eve-of-vote speech on Tuesday.
 He has said he has yet to decide on his future. Critics, who liken Putin to a latter-day Tsar, say they are sure he will run again, but some analysts say he may want to keep his options open to avoid becoming a lame duck.
 At 60 per cent, according to the Levada pollster, his approval rating remains high but well down on its peak of nearly 90 per cent.
 With Russia reporting thousands of new COVID-19 cases each day, opponents have been unable to stage protests but have mocked the vote online, sharing photographs of polling stations in apartment stairwells, supermarket trolleys and the boot of a car.
 Golos, a non-governmental organisation that monitors elections, cited numerous irregularities with the vote and said it would not be able to confirm the outcome as legitimate.
