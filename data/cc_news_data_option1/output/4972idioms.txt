The strained sounds of a pop song bounce off the walls and spill onto the sidewalk. Its hollow, tinny sound parallels the look inside the bar: empty. Barstools stand as reminders of the once bustling business and warm-hearted social interactions that took place there. Outside, holiday lights sway in the breeze as traffic lights go through multiple cycles without any cars in sight. A few patrons prohibited from quaffing their drinks inside huddle against railing set up on the sidewalk and sip from their beer cans and tumblers in between puffs of e-cigarettes. The discarded vapor twirls into the night air, unsure where it's going or what will become of it.
 The entire scene is a metaphor for what taverns and bars are going through right now. This week marks 85 years since the 18th Amendment, aka the Prohibition Act, was repealed, but North Carolina did not officially repeal Prohibition until 1935. In some ways, it still feels like 1935 to bar owners.
 Executive Order No. 118 issued on March 17 by Gov. Roy Cooper required restaurants, bars and taverns to shut their doors due to coronavirus safety concerns. There was a glimmer of hope for financial relief for bar owners in early May when the NC General Assembly finalized a $1.5 billion relief package to address the pandemic. The NC House passed a provision that would have allowed businesses to sell mixed alcoholic drinks for takeout and delivery, but it didn’t survive negotiations and was removed from the final draft.

Over the last two decades, gold has risen by over 10 times, and the long-term steep rise has had its crests and troughs along the way. One must also remember that the supply of gold is limited, and since there is demand from both individuals and central banks of various countries, the price of gold in the long term is more likely to have an upward trajectory.

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Policies favoring secrecy over transparency have meant that New Yorkers will be among the last Americans to learn the final vote tallies in the 2020 election. Results in a few races are still unknown one month after Election Day. Several locally run election boards responsible for processing a record 2 million absentee ballots didn't release any rolling updates, only sharing data once the final votes were tallied. A state law that requires counties to wait about a week before they start counting absentee ballots contributed to the delays. But state officials say it's more complex than that and one state senator has proposed legislation to streamline and speed up absentee balloting in the state.
