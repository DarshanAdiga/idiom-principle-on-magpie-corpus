In the midst of everything going on, we launched a very exciting product called Proxis made with our rock skin technology. This is something we're producing internally in Hungary. It's an amazing product. We've launched it in Asia and Europe in July. It had very good reception. Despite sales being down, the reception to the marketplace has been very strong. This will launch in U.S. and Latin America in 2021. We thought right to push it off and have the teams focused and allow it to play out in Asia and Europe in the reception, the media reception, the customer feedback, super strong.

“The adjustment was definitely tough for me, just because I guess the situation didn’t go as I planned it to,” he said of playing at Montverde. “But we had a really good team, and every day for me was competitive. In the long run, it helped me a lot.
 "I know a lot of people probably couldn’t see it, but behind the scenes, it definitely helped me a lot and prepared me for this level of basketball.”
 The biggest strides he made, he said, were non-basketball related. The mental toughness required to adjust to less playing time and the unbelievable speed of the game were aspects he wasn’t going to see at Maumee Valley Country Day, and it helped him at Michigan from day one.
 In that sense, there have been a lot of positive takeaways.
 “I’m big on, especially since I’ve gotten here, improving every little way I can,” he said. “I know here, a lot of little things matter — everything from simply just sprinting the floor to cutting down the length of passes. There are a lot of things I’ve learned and took away from our practices here at Michigan.
 … “Eli and Mike at my position have taught me a lot. I try to learn as much as I can when I’m on the side or watching. I try to watch those two, and I know Eli does a lot of the little things correctly. I learn a lot from them, and I keep asking questions.”
 Just as he does with the rest of them. It’s a tight-knit bunch, and Jackson has been impressed with the leadership.
 “I think the biggest thing that stands out with our team is how connected we are. I know with the past teams I’ve been on that have been successful or just past years in general, this is the type of environment it was,” he said. “I feel like we have a very good chance of being very successful just based on how connected we are as a group.
 “As a freshman, there were definitely some things I couldn’t really prepare for because I didn’t know what to expect. But it’s honestly been better than what I expected, especially with the conditions with COVID and everything.”
 He remained loyal after committing to former Coach John Beilein, only to see him opt for the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers. Howard made it clear how much he wanted him, and Jackson never flinched in reinforcing his pledge.
 "Coach Beilein and Coach Howard are both great coaches. Their styles are definitely a little different, but after Coach B. decided to coach for the Cavs and Coach Howard came in, the biggest thing with me was Coach Howard gave me the confidence I needed to still trust in him,” Jackson said. “He gained my trust from day one. That was huge for me.
 “I was planning on being a combo guard anyway, so my role didn’t change too much. But my style of play has definitely changed.”
 He’s relied on Zavier Simpson and others for the scouting report, so he came prepared. Now he’s ready to make an impact, and he’s impressed enough in the early going to think it might be a very realistic possibility.

COVID-19 is having a devastating effect on businesses.
 The state has also received an unprecedented number of unemployment claims, with more than 1 million, and there is a huge budget deficit.
 “There are some things we can do. We are sending out $5,000 grants to all the small businesses in need that have been hit by COVID. That’s going out as we speak, and we have the shared work program, so if you’re a restaurant and can’t afford to keep full wait staff, we will pay for others half of their salary,” Lamont said.
 Like many people across the state, and around the country, he’s also dealing with stress, and that is challenging.
 “It used to be at the end of the day I would always take a long walk. That was my idea of relief. I wish we could have stayed on Daylight Saving Time, but we can’t, so now I need to find a way to work around that,” he said.

Information from a plea agreement and the sentencing hearing showed that Thompson robbed a Waterloo bank, stealing $1,589, on October 25, 2018. Thompson was wearing a tight black hoodie over his face and sunglasses with blue lenses, and was carrying a cloth bag.  Thompson demanded that a teller put money in the bag, and when the teller was not doing so fast enough, Thompson grabbed at something under his jacket and said, “don’t make me pull it out.”  The teller believed Thompson had a gun.  Thompson then escaped in a truck driven by another person.  Later in the day, an employee of a store near the bank saw the same truck and followed it through Waterloo.  The employee relayed the truck’s license plate to law enforcement, and law enforcement later arrested Thompson.

On Page 26, we put together an adjusted EBITDA bridge. You saw this in the last presentation as well. I think what we're looking at here is the year-to- date numbers, but I do think it bears just a couple of minutes for me to go through in terms of what the quarter improvement has been. So that large bar -- I mean at the end of the day, the biggest story is when you have the sales that are falling off, that large bar is the gross profit decrease from lower sales. So as we work our way from left to right, we're looking at the year-to- date numbers in 2019, there's a little bit of a minimal FX impact of $5 million. But really, the large negative is coming from $857 million of gross profit decrease from lower sales.

If we think about the pace of the velocity of the lease up, it's obviously exceeded our expectations at Jackson Park and enabled us to get exceptional financing. And so I'm not sure that we would have done anything differently. And then [casting forward], my guess is -- again, I don't think that the property was intentionally targeting international students. It’s just at the end of the day, it was opened where we came in through their marketing efforts and leased units.

Yes. As you know, Asia was our highest margin business. It's a really good forward teller, right? When you really look at gross margin and EBITDA margin, Asia as a region has always had slightly higher margins. So they get to positive faster than the other regions largely because they've executed on the cost savings initiatives and have been able to kind of maintain their overall margin profile if you kind of weeded out the noise. So they get there faster, but it's a perfect tell tale of the rest of the regions get there when the profit -- when the sales number just improves a bit more, right? So it's not a surprise to us that Asia gets there a little bit ahead of the rest of the regions just because of the way the profit profile of the business works.

A source with knowledge of the situation indicated that due to the ongoing pandemic and its financial impact on the league's bottom line, MLS has sent a procedural notice to the MLS Players Association that would preserve the league's right to invoke the force majeure clause that was added to the Collective Bargaining Agreement last June.
 The source added there is no intention to invoke the clause at this time, and the notice only allows MLS to do so at some point in the future. A force majeure clause allows either side to cancel the CBA in the event of catastrophic event like a pandemic.
 MLS declined to comment regarding the force majeure clause. An attempt to reach the MLSPA for comment was not successful.
 Last June, MLS commissioner Don Garber said that the league was set to suffer a $1 billion revenue hit. The source added that exact numbers have yet to be tabulated.
 With fans only allowed to attend MLS matches on a limited basis in some markets -- and in other markets not at all -- the league continues to miss out on the gameday revenues that are the backbone of its business.
 The source added that the league was able to claw back some revenues on the broadcast rights side, but that the league incurred additional expenses due to teams using charter flights to travel to away games, COVID-19 testing, and the MLS is Back tournament that was held in a bubble in Orlando, Florida, last July.

AMLO has long been a critic of the energy reform measures put into place in 2013 and 2014 that opened up investment in Mexico by foreign companies.

My guess is the desirability of that property over the short-term will increase. We have a very significant competitive moat to the remainder of the market due to those amenities.

Yes. Well, that's a trickier story. So I think we've given guidance for Q4. I think we've given you some indications for Q1. I do think next year is better.

But that's because there's a building recovery going on. But that's our best view. It's a hard one to put your thumbs on because it's not fully in our control. But that's how we're modeling the business so that we can make the right decisions. We will deliver EBITDA, positive EBITDA next year. And I guess the only indication I'll give you is if that's all improving, and I think we can get to breakeven or positive in Q1, I think you can do the math to say, we should have a good story next year. And I think our exit run rate for the end of next year, I think, will be a really wonderful moment for this business. If you just do the math, think about the savings that we've talked about, what's there. But I don't want to be so crystal clear on guidance because there's a lot of moving pieces, if that's okay.

On Page 32, this is a slide that Kyle touched on a little bit earlier as well as you look at the sequential kind of quarter-after-quarter improvement on fixed variable and A&P. The one point that I'll note on here is if you look at Q3, Q3 2020 versus Q2 2020, there is an increase on SG&A, even though it's a massive decrease. Please bear in mind where that comes from. That's because we have incremental sales. So the sales start to go up, the variable component of SG&A is a little bit higher. So you see that 30.2% number in Q2 has grown to $41.1 million. That's not a bad thing. So as you have higher sales, you have a higher variable. But I think the important point here is looking at that fixed bar, that fixed bar in Q2 2020 of $155.1 million is now down to $150.5 million. And we hope to be in that ZIP code as we work our way forward as well.

IEnova operates the Energía Costa Azul LNG facility near Ensenada, which opened in 2008 as an import facility. But IEnova and Sempra have designs on adding an export component to the plant that would send cargoes of natural gas to energy-hungry markets such as China and Japan. Last week during a third- quarter earnings call, Sempra CEO Jeremy Martin said the company expected to receive the permit by the end of November, which could lead to the project getting the green light by the end of the year.
 Martin said the proposed expansion would be the largest construction project in the history of Baja California.
 An LNG export facility on the Pacific is considered lucrative because most U.S. terminals are located in the Gulf of Mexico and in order for shipments to go to Asia, tankers have to go through and pay tolls at the Panama Canal. A facility in Baja can skip the tolls and arrive at their destinations in the Pacific in about half the time.
 The natural gas would come from fields in the U.S., such as the Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, and arrive at Energía Costa Azul via pipeline.

A.J. De La Garza is not the most imposing Inter Miami player. At 5-9 and 150 pounds, he is one of the smaller center backs in Major League Soccer history.
 But he has been an influential figure on and off the field every step of his career and could prove critical as the nascent team heads into its MLS playoff opener Nov. 20 at Nashville SC.
 Everywhere De La Garza goes, he wins trophies. His resume includes a pair of youth national titles, two NCAA titles, and three MLS Cup championships.
 The 33-year-old defender - son of a Native American mother and Mexican- Guamanian father -- makes up for his slight stature with his timing, tenacity, positioning, voice, and smarts. He knows when to step up and when to retreat. De La Garza never backs down from an opponent, facing every challenge with undaunted courage.
 Never was that more evident than on Sept. 4, 2014, when he and his wife Megan lost their newborn son, Luca, who died one week after birth due to complications from hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a rare congenital defect.

 If the number of visitors was any criterion, yesterday’s open house at the new Clearfield County Vocational Technical School was an outstanding success. Upwards of 3,000 persons visited the building at Kerr Addition during the three-hour open house, and it is likely that many more were turned away because of lack of parking facilities. The crowd taxed the parking facilities to the limit and state police on duty at the entrance from Route 879 were forced to turn away many automobiles although some probably came back later when parking was available. The visitors toured the nine shops now in operation and saw preparations for opening of additional educational areas in the 1971-72 school year.

 But the reunion special won't just be smiles and laughs.
 The trailer teases some difficult moments as the cast discusses the late James Avery, the actor who played father-figure Uncle Phil on the show and who passed away six years ago from complications after an open heart surgery.
 "James Avery was this six-foot-four Shakespearen beast," Smith can be heard saying in the trailer. "And I wanted him to think I was good."
 Those aren't the only tears.
 The trailer shows the cast reflecting on the importance that the show -- which ran for six seasons and a whopping 148 episodes -- especially had for Black viewers.
 "Our show meant Black excellence to people," Ali said in the trailer. "That excellence was the way that we loved each other."

"After all this praying and all this hoping, he can't believe it," Mawer added.
 Seresi, 73, was one of four defendants sentenced to 505 years behind bars in 1991 for laundering cocaine cartel cash who were featured in a CNN report published in August. The article noted how the sentences were considered harsh even back then and represent the sort of draconian punishment that has since been widely condemned amid a national conversation around justice reform.
 When the case was before Wilson in August, he denied a request by prosecutors to overturn the men's convictions "in the interests of justice" due to special treatment given to a government witness by FBI agents that was not disclosed to the defense. Wilson conducted a months-long review into the matter and concluded that the men's convictions were sufficiently supported by evidence and testimony unrelated to that particular witness.
 All four defendants filed an appeal with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is pending.
 But Seresi's attorneys also filed a motion seeking his release on compassionate grounds, due in part to his advanced age and a diagnosis of high blood pressure making him susceptible to serious complications from Covid-19. Prosecutors in the US Attorney's Office in Los Angeles did not oppose the motion.
 While Wilson found that those factors alone did not entitle Seresi to early release, he noted other factors that — taken together — amounted to "extraordinary and compelling reasons" for granting his freedom.
 Seresi was convicted of a nonviolent offense, had already served more than 30 years behind bars, earned three associate degrees while incarcerated and had a near spotless disciplinary record, the judge noted.
 "The Court's findings should not be construed to minimize the severity of the Defendant's conduct," Wilson wrote, noting that Seresi was "a key employee of the ringleaders of a substantial money laundering conspiracy."
 Wilson wrote that he was ordering the release under a "catch all" provision of federal law that, in his view, allowed him to consider a wide variety of factors concerning Seresi's continued imprisonment.
 "Very few cases will fall within that provision," Wilson wrote. "Most will not."

In a stunning reprieve for a man sentenced to more than five centuries behind bars for a nonviolent offense, a judge in Los Angeles on Thursday summarily slashed his sentence to time served and ordered his immediate release.
