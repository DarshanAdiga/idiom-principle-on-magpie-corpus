Suspect on the run after leading deputies on chase

Individual investors often strive to create a solid strategy before trying to take on the market. Setting up realistic, attainable goals, may be a good place for the amateur to start. There are many different approaches that the investor can take when getting into the stock market. Some investors will try to follow strategies that have worked for others in the past. Sometimes this will work, and sometimes it will not. Markets and economic landscapes are constantly changing. A strategy that worked yesterday may not work again tomorrow. Investors who put in the time to do the necessary homework may find themselves much better off when the market decides to rear its ugly head at some point down the road.

"We are just beginning to scratch the surface on the myriad ways climate change is impacting people, especially through social systems and health," Karnauskas said. "We could see a future where results like this impact planning and resource allocation among health, law enforcement and criminal justice communities."

For some, Kaimana Coffee is on the way to work, but even if it's not, it may be worth making a detour. The espresso bar on wheels parks weekday mornings in front of Oregon Community Credit Union's corporate office on Chad Drive, but I wouldn't be surprised if smart Costco shoppers start to trickle over from next door. Especially if they're savvy enough to travel with a reusable mug. In fact, they'll need one, because Kaimana eschews single-use cups.
 Though the Kaimana truck was built in Idaho by her father, co-owner Tonya Kent said she and her husband, Josh, started their coffee business in Maui, where they lived for five years with their two daughters. After a little over a year in business, they were missing the mountains of the Northwest and decided to return to Oregon, where they arrived in late 2019.
 During the transition, the Kents decided to get rid of the sugar cane eco-cups they'd been using. Folks on Maui were strongly opposed to single-use straws, they said, but to them, doing away with the cup was an even bigger win. They may be one of the first businesses in Eugene to not offer a free single-use container for food or drinks to-go (there is a durable, compostable cup you can buy for $2.75). I applaud them for it, especially because to-go is all the truck offers.
 A menu of espresso drinks in the $3 to $4.50 range, milky indulgences like steamed golden milk and horchata slushies (make it dirty with an espresso shot) and several tea lattes is rounded out by light fare for $3.50 to $4.50. That's three melty ciabatta sammies and a breakfast porridge featuring hazelnut-coconut-cashew nut meal that's a byproduct of the nut milk on the drink menu. This zero-waste mentality fits right into Eugene.
 Dairy milk is sourced nearby from Royal Riverside farm in Albany, but coffee hearkens back to the Pacific Island where Kaimana was born. Pricier beans from Big Island Coffee Roasters, grown in the Kona and Ka'u districts of Hawaii, are used for pour-overs. Beans for drip coffee and espresso are sourced from other far-flung origins via Paradise Coffee Roasters, which roasts in Minnesota and on the Big Island. But the owners say they're open to working with local-to-Oregon roasters, too.
 In their second week of business here, the Kents were a ray of sunshine on a chilly, gray Oregon morning. And I daresay my luscious vanilla latte stayed a lot warmer in my Klean Kanteen travel thermos than it would have in a paper cup. Grab your mug (clean, please) and head over to see them.
