The bilingual information boards looked like they hadn’t been renewed in a good while, but they helped me identify a few plants. After my visit, I learned more by reading a 2002 presentation given by Fan Kuei-chu (范貴珠), an associate professor in the Department of Forestry, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology.

As her life has grown increasingly surreal, the journalist Maria Ressa has gained a newfound sympathy for the dazed girl in Wonderland. In the course of her Zoom interview, she also claims to feel like one of the characters in Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, benumbed by a constant stream of media stimulation. She feels like Cassandra as well, doomed to speak truths that fall on deaf ears. And she sometimes feels like Sisyphus, he of the unending boulder-push.

Mood boards, I create lots of moodboards. I make playlists that inspire me. I journal. I take photos and slowly a direction and a feel begins to surface. I’m not afraid to collaborate, in fact i generally think that in room most people are more talented, more creative and have better ideas than me so really value their input in brining my songs and ideas to life. For example my latest trilogy I knew with songs like Terror Living and Freaks and Dreamers there was no room to play it safe aesthetically so I collaborated with a local artist called Houl. He created these hauntingly beautiful and twisted characters for my artwork which I think just completed the whole body of work so wonderfully.

Following what Diaz describes as “a long negotiation,” Ressa allowed the camera crew a rare degree of access to Rappler’s inner operations as well as her own home life. (“Ramona came in, we knew we couldn’t document this ourselves, and I didn’t want to have to pay for it,” Ressa laughs.) For Diaz, gaining entry to Duterte’s inner circle proved much simpler. She received special permissions exceeding those of Filipino press, with approval coming back even before Rappler had gotten on board. Her film spends a goodly amount of time with such tertiary figures as Duterte’s right-hand enforcer Bato and the so-called “queen of fake news” Mocha Uson, both of whom saw their participation as an opportunity to leverage their public profile to their advantage.

And, after a 2:17 a.m. summit, the way down from La Plata wasn’t any better.
 “Quite a few people have actually gotten lost coming down off La Plata on their Nolan’s routes. I think it’s ended a couple bids. I always thought that was weird because it’s just a standard route. … But coming down that in the night I now understand how people get lost, because it’s just a big pile of rocks,” he said.
