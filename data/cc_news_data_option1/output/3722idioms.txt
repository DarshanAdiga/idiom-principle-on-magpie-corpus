Johnson's assessment is spot on. While hope is certainly useful to the extent it motivates people to action rather than abject surrender -- to vote, to alter how they live and consume resources and to influence their family, friends and neighbors to similar action -- there is no realistic chance at this point that things will, as the saying goes, "all turn out okay."

CAPE MAY — Standing outside the Harriet Tubman Museum, Gov. Phil Murphy told a crowd Thursday that each must ask themselves if they will be part of the struggle for equality or remain on the sidelines of history.


  “This is a place for us to reflect on the uncomfortable truth that as much as our nation has changed for the better across its history, we still have a long way to go in ensuring the founding ideals of this nation — life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness — ring true not just for some but for every single American,” Murphy said.

As soon as your new smartphone is taken out of the box, it starts to lose value. According to buyback site and refurbished seller, Decluttr, if tradition holds, the current generation of Apple iPhone models will lose 15% of their valuation within one month following the launch of the iPhone 12 line. Speaking about the 2019 iPhone models, Decluttr's annual Phone depreciation report made a fascinating  discovery: the more expensive a phone, the less amount of money it loses to depreciation. For example, 2018's iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max cost $999 and $1,099 at launch. Over the handsets' first six months, they lost 43% and 42% respectively. On the other hand, the OnePlus 7 Pro, which cost $669 at launch, lost 63% of its value over six months.
 ## Apple iPhone units tend to retain more of their value than other phones

n anii ’90 nici o filială ASCOR nu avea un preot îndrumător așa cum se înțelege astăzi, nici nu era prevăzut în statutul asociației așa ceva. Între anii 1992 și 1999, părintele a influențat însă foarte mult ASCOR-ul București (fără să-și propună acest lucru) întrucât mai mulți ascoriști ne spovedeam la sfinția sa. Nu cred că este întâmplător faptul că tocmai în acești ani ASCOR- ul a fost o prezență foarte vie în mediile studențești din capitală. Părintele ne-a transmis tinerilor de atunci din această asociație, fără ca noi să fim conștienți, ceva din moștenirea sa duhovnicească, o anumită așezare lăuntrică. Mai departe a depins de fiecare dintre noi dacă a înmulțit sau nu acest talant. După ani de zile mi-am dat seama că această stare de har care, în ciuda neputințelor noastre, exista între noi s-a datorat îndeosebi binecuvântărilor și rugăciunilor părintelui Sofian.

After finishing as league champions of the Ligue de Baseball Inter-Cité Métropolitaine with a 15-5 record, the bantam AA Laval Associe were eliminated by a hot-hitting Lac St. Louis Orange Tigers squad in semi-final action. The Tigers had their hitting shoes on as they mercied the Associe by a 13-3 score in the bottom of the fifth inning at Dollard’s Lake Road Park on Wednesday, September 9. “It has been a great season, we finished as league champions,” Laval head coach Michel Lefebvre said. “We came up against a good hitting team and that was the difference. “ Laval had built to a 3-1 lead through their first three at bats. The Associe went up 2-1 in the top of the second after Mylo Pereira and Alexander Rolland touched home on Julian-Jayden Caruso’s single. In the top of the third, Rolland singled to cash in Mathias Bergeron to make it 3-1 in favour of the visitors. That was all though as starting Tiger pitcher Nathan Senecal got stronger as the game moved forward. “I felt good and was ready (to face Laval),” Nathan Senecal said. “They are a really good team.” Lac St. Louis’ bats came to life in their home half of the third scoring five times to take a 6-3 lead. The coup de grace was a monster shot of a homer off of the bat of Jacob Wallace over the centerfield fence for three runs and a 5-3 lead. “I knew the pitcher was throwing fastballs mostly,” Jacob Wallace said. “I just stood back in the box and waited on one.” Laval had a scoring opportunity robbed from them in the top of the fourth when a diving catch in centerfield by Justin Seguin not only kept the Associe from scoring but ended the inning. “Those were two things that put us down,” coach Lefebvre said. “That homerun and the catch changed the complexion of the game, it gave them momentum.”The Tigers upped the ante in the bottom of the fourth to take a 10-3 advantage and Senecal helped his cause by cracking out a two run triple. Laval surrendered three runs in the bottom of the fifth, giving the Tigers a 10 point lead, which ended the game on the mercy rule. “We (the coaches) are proud of how the team played and learned this year,” he said. “They re league champions and we will celebrate that.”

EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) — Nikolai Khabibulin wakes up in Yekaterinburg to watch NHL playoff highlights and beams with pride at the saves made by so many Russian goaltenders.
 For the first time, there are three Russian starting goaltenders in the conference finals and two will face off in the final. Sixteen years after Khabibulin became the first Russian goalie to win the Stanley Cup, Anton Khudobin of the Dallas Stars, Andrei Vasilevskiy of the Tampa Bay Lightning and Semyon Varlamov of the New York Islanders are following his lead and showcasing the country’s strength between the pipes throughout multiple generations.
 “It’s actually quite interesting to experience this because it has never happened before," Khabibulin said. “I would’ve never thought this would happen, but it is happening.”
 From Hall of Famer Vladislav Tretiak in the Red Army days to Khabibulin and Evgeni Nabokov last generation and guys now like Vasilevskiy, Varlamov and Florida's Sergei Bobrovsky, Russia's hockey history is full of strong goaltending. After a several-year gap caused by the downfall of the Soviet Union, the nation is again producing some of the best in the world with young prospects Igor Shesterkin, Ilya Sorokin, Ilya Samsonov and 2020 draft-eligible Yaroslav Askarov making up the next wave of stars.
 “It’s crazy now we have all those goalies because before that was our problem, but now we have so many great goalies," Washington Capitals winger Ilya Kovalchuk said. "It says that hockey system is growing in Russia. The goaltenders who’s retired, they help the system to grow those young kids as good players. It’s great to see that many guys come to the NHL like Vasilevskiy, Varlamov and all those guys, Bobrovsky. They’re all dominating. It’s great.”
 Nabokov, who lead goalies born in the Soviet Union or Russia with 353 regular- season and 42 playoff wins, is helping that process as goalie coach of the San Jose Sharks. While he deals with professionals, he notices Russian and Finnish goaltending coaches back home teaching the position to very young players.

 Stratford finished with 270 yards with 165 on the ground and 105 though the air.
 Allen scored on its first offensive possession of the game as Tatum went 40-yards for the early Mustang lead.
 Stratford came right back with Payton Wood hittin Nolan Hall with a 23-yard touchdown pass, tying the game at 6-6.
 It was all Allen after that on the scoreboard.
 Tatum scored his second touchdown of the game on the Mustangs next possession racing in from 20 yards outs. Nix then added a 2-yard touchdown run late in the half for a 20-6 halftime lead.

 Our organization has supported the creation of independent, citizen-led redistricting committees in Michigan and Colorado, as well as reforms to make the process less partisan in Ohio, Utah, and Missouri. These reforms - in red, blue, and purple states - were on the ballot in 2018 and passed with the support of the people. The fact is that voters of all political stripes are fed up with a broken political system that gives politicians the power to pick their voters instead of letting the people choose their representatives.

A few years later, he proposed not once but twice and the two were married on a hilltop overlooking Spofford Lake in New Hampshire on May 2, 1992. Their life together was filled with love, laughter, skiing, music and Sunday football games cheering on the Patriots and Giants.
 Switz had a large network of friends on and off the slope. He merely had to step out his front door and someone would soon stop and offer to give him a ride to the mountain. He had a quick wit, was a master at Jeopardy, and could tell a story like no other. Reader’s Digest should have devoted space in every issue for his jokes. Whether he was singing “Boardwalk” at family gatherings or sharing apres ski cocktails with friends at The Brewski, Switz brought love and laughter everywhere he went.

Once that date is set — if a date is set — the training camp calendar will be established.
 “They have to designate that they’re going to have a season and pick a start date before everything else can be formalized,” a source said.
 The conference medical advisors believe players need six weeks of preparation, with a two-week ramp period followed by four weeks of full-contact training camp and practice.
 There is some discussion within the conference about shortening the period of preparation to five weeks.
 However, several sources expect the presidents to lean on the medical advisors for guidance, pointing to a total of six weeks.
 Crucially, the ramp period could begin before the daily antigen testing programs are up and running, according to sources. That would help accelerate the start of camp and the regular season.

By default the district will assume parents want whichever option they chose in August.If a parent wants to change their decision they can contact their individual school and request the change. They have until September 25 to do so.Schools have taken social distancing precautions like spreading out desks and accommodating for smaller classes, and also adding hand sanitizer around the school. The hybrid model will allow half of the in-person students to attend school Mondays and Thursdays and the other half to attend Tuesdays and Fridays.The school will be deep cleaned on Wednesdays and over the weekend. Students going back will return on October 5. The district says they always hoped this would be the case.“So we’ve said all along that we would give a two week notice and this is a little bit more than two weeks. And it allows for that type of preparation and for families to get ready for that shift," said Superintendent Frank Rodriguez.The district has also terminated their contract with K-12 Learning Solutions, the program originally purchased to be used for the virtual school year.Copyright 2020 WTOC.

 Roethlisberger is hopeful the saga of his extended comeback came to an end in northern New Jersey last Monday, when he tossed three touchdowns in a relatively solid and mistake-free 26-16 victory over the New York Giants.
 From here on out, he expects the focus to be on football, though that may be impossible heading into Pittsburgh's home opener against Denver (0-1) on Sunday.

 Rather than strictly preparing for the Broncos, Roethlisberger and the organization found itself spending a portion of the week facing questions about team unity after left tackle Alejandro Villanueva chose to honor a fallen US Army veteran on the back of his helmet rather than a Black Pittsburgh teenager killed by a white East Pittsburgh police officer in 2018, as the rest of the team did in New York. It was a move that caught Roethlisberger and defensive tackle Cameron Heyward — both longtime captains — off guard.
 It got to the point that Steelers president Art Rooney II issued a statement saying he was “proud” of the efforts of the players to “bring awareness and changes to combat racism and social injustice” while acknowledging “we understand that individually we may say or do things that are not universally accepted.”

 STOPPING HENRY
 Just about every defensive move Jacksonville made in the offseason was designed to better stop the run, specifically Derrick Henry. The Jaguars ranked 28th in the NFL against the run in 2019, and Henry managed 203 yards and three touchdowns on the ground in two games against them.
 General manager Dave Caldwell and coach Doug Marrone revamped their D-line, moved Myles Jack back to outside linebacker and signed in-the-box safety Josh Jones. Jack and Jones led the way Sunday as Jacksonville held Indy to 88 yards rushing — more than 50 yards under what it allowed last year.

 Tennessee is 14-0 when Henry rushes for 100 yards or more. Henry also is averaging 104.3 yards rushing against AFC South teams since becoming the starter in 2018. His 1,251 yards rushing inside the division lead the NFL in that time, a total that includes 498 yards rushing against the Jaguars.

 “He's right about the Second Amendment, but what about the First Amendment,” said a man who added a comment about not being able to criticize a “tyrant” in high political offices like the White House.
 As for the racial justice movement sweeping the country for months now, Broyles said this is something that clearly needed to come to the forefront.
 “I'm glad we're having conversations in this country that are long overdue on racial injustices,” she said.
 “We can't have bad apples who are racists in police departments and part of a system that's failing us. I'm not for dismantling police departments or taking away guns.”
 The candidates suggests part of the solution is to better train law enforcement and not ask officers to deal with many things they're not properly trained for such as some social and mental health situations.
 “They're dealing with so many situations they're not trained for, and that keeps them from keeping people safe at times.”

 On the roof, where they “adjust pressure gauges and turn knobs and stuff,” at least the first day up there, it’s also breezy and free. Inside, it’s a different story, especially in the bathroom.
 Trips to the lavatory have to be staggered — Dave, the nascent ventilation expert, said that’s in order to allow the air to circulate following the last visitor.
 It’s small things like that that act as a constant reminder the school day is different. It’s like the masks, which kids are used to wearing, but not necessarily for such extended periods of time.

“This determination has slowed the spread of this virus. It’s kept our hospital capacity stable and without a doubt it has saved lives. It has also put our state in a position to move another careful step forward in a critical area: schools.”
 So far this school year, the state has given the schools the option of opening their doors to limited numbers of students to allow for six feet of social distance in classrooms and other areas students might congregate.
 Moore County Schools reopened to K-12 students on Aug. 17, with two separate cohorts of students attending class for two days and learning online for the other three. That’s the most aggressive reopening plan that the state has permitted during the coronavirus pandemic.
 The new plan that Cooper announced on Thursday allows elementary schools to relax those standards.
 “Our No. 1 priority from the get-go has been to get our children back in the classroom,” Cooper said. “We know the great benefits of in-person learning, so this has been our plan as our metrics improve and as our safety protocols are installed across our state.”
 Starting in early October, local school districts can operate their elementary schools under “Plan A,” with their classrooms at full capacity. Social distancing measures will remain in place and all students, teachers and staff will still be required to wear face coverings.
 These guidelines are an option rather than a mandate, Cooper said. Local school boards can also continue with the hybrid plans they have in place or with entirely remote learning.
 “Plan A may not be right at this time for many school districts, and for every family,” Cooper said. “Opportunities for remote learning need to be available for families to choose it, and districts will have the flexibility to select a plan based on their unique situation.”
 Cooper also acknowledged during Thursday’s press conference that it will likely take several weeks for school districts to plan a broader reopening for elementary school students.
 The Moore County Board of Education’s next work session is scheduled for Oct. 5. Superintendent Bob Grimesey said after the governor’s announcement Thursday that district staff will advise the board on potentially shifting elementary schools to Plan A at that point.

VANCOUVER - Itasca Capital Ltd. says it will add businessmen Paul Rivett and Rick Doman to its board of directors to help pursue additional lumber investments after buying a Kenora sawmill and related assets for $11.5 million.


  Rivett has been in the news recently after taking part with partner Jordan Bitove in the purchase of newspaper publisher Torstar Corp. for $60 million through their company, NordStar Capital LP.


  Doman is the founder of Montreal-based Eacom Timber Corp., which owns sawmills and other forest products operations in Eastern Canada. Rivett is the former president of Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd.


  The Kenora mill is being purchased through a court-appointed receiver by an Itasca investee company and is to be renamed GreenFirst Forest Products Inc.


  It has access to up to 450,000 cubic meters per year of northern SPF (spruce, pine, fir) timber and is equipped to produce up to 100 million board feet per year of lumber on two shifts.


  Itasca says it is expected that the Kenora sawmill can be optimized to boost capacity to 200 million board feet annually.

After having their opening week game canceled due to Saltillo being quarantined after players tested positive for the coronavirus, Itawamba Agricultural High School traveled to New Hope High School to open the season against the Trojans.
 The Indians opened the game with possession and moved the ball into Trojan territory before being forced to punt. The Trojan returner muffed the punt, and Maquion Green recovered for the Indians. Ty Davis connected with Tae Chandler for a one-yard touchdown that gave the Indians a 7-0 lead. Later in the first quarter Davis would connect with Chandler again for a 34-yard reception, and Chandler ended the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. IAHS led 14-0 after the first quarter.
 It took New Hope nearly the entire first half before they got on the scoreboard; with 18 seconds remaining the Trojans connected on a 35-yard touchdown, but the Indians held a 14-7 lead at the half.
 New Hope found a weakness in the IAHS defense to begin the second half, as they switched to the speed option and ran it to perfection. They opened the third quarter with a strong ground attack that led to a touchdown, bringing the game to 14-13. IAHS responded well, as Ty Davis connected with Isaac Smith for an 18-yard touchdown and a 21-13 lead to end the third quarter.
 }In the fourth quarter, New Hope got within 21-19 and had the ball. However, the Indian defense, held strong as Aaron Shook had a huge interception in Trojan territory, which led to a 5-yard touchdown run by Green, and IAHS escaped with a 27-19 win.
 Though IAHS had opening game miscues and penalties, head coach Clint Hoots and the Indian staff have a youthful group that is only going to improve week to week.
 The Indians are 1-0 and will host Senatobia Friday night at Indian Stadium.

“Everyone associated with the Big Ten should be very proud of the groundbreaking steps that are now being taken to better protect the health and safety of the student-athletes and surrounding communities,” Ohio State Head Team Physician Dr. Jim Borchers said, according to the release.
 According to the conference’s announcement, the regular season will kick off the weekend of Oct. 23-24. Wisconsin Athletic Director Barry Alvarez said on Big Ten Network that teams will play a total of nine games. There will be eight normal regular season games, plus each team will play an additional game on the conference's championship weekend. The division champs will play for the conference title as usual, but every Big Ten team will play a game against the team in the opposite division with the same division standing as them.
 Student-athletes, coaches, trainers and others who will be on the field for practices and games will be required to undergo antigen testing daily. On game days, test results must be completed and recorded prior to the competition. Daily testing will begin in two weeks, on Sept. 30.
 If a team’s positivity rate among its tests reaches a number greater than 5%, and the “population positivity rate,” which is the number of positive tests divided by the total population at risk, reaches a number greater than 7.5%, teams must stop practice and competition for a minimum of seven days.
 These numbers designate a “red area.” If teams are in the orange (team positivity rate 2-5%, population positivity rate 3.5-7.5%), they can proceed with caution. Anything below those numbers and teams can continue with practice and competition as usual.

Nobody's done more of that than Berks Catholic, which Wednesday found its fourth different opponent for its opener. Northwestern Lehigh suddenly had an opening that morning; within hours the Saints were on board. Otherwise they wouldn't have started until Oct. 2.


  Every team will be observing COVID-19 rules and regulations for health and safety that will affect transportation to games, locker room use, huddles on the field and where players stand on the sidelines.


  Stadiums will be mostly empty due to Wolf's outdoor gatherings limit of 250 people. Some of the larger schools may not be able to accommodate any fans; many will allow some, but not many. (Wilson is slated to allow 609 at Gurski Stadium.)


  An element of excitement will be lost.


  “The emotional highs and emotional lows probably aren't going to be as high or as low,” said Wilson coach Doug Dahms. “They're high school kids; they feed off the crowd.”


  Players have been encouraged not to high-five or hug, but after scoring a touchdown how are you going to prevent that?


  “We've talked about it,” said Wyomissing athletic director Frank Ferrandino, a Spartans assistant coach, “but the emotions of the event … they're going to react; they're going to get excited.”


  As they should. Many thought they'd never put the pads on; seniors agonized at the thought that a season they've waited years for might not happen.


  “The worst part about everything has been not knowing,” Bauer said. “Trying to keep these kids' spirits up, and (yet) not give them false hope.”


  Wyomissing coach Bob Wolfrum said that for months he's held his breath every time the phone rang. Too often it's been bad news.


  Today the news is all good. Players and coaches can look forward to tonight —and maybe even to the playoffs come late October.


  No matter how things turn out, it'll be a season like no other, impossible to forget.


  “I wasn't sure this day was going to get here,” admitted Gov. Mifflin coach Jeff Lang. “Our prayers are being answered right now. We just want to play football; that's what we've been working on, that's what we do.”

The group — a collection of organisations that aligned specifically for the effort to push out Bartomeu — hopes that, if the signatures are accepted, a no-confidence vote will be held later this year.
 Marc Duch, a member of the group calling itself Més Que Una Moció, a play on Barcelona’s “more than a club” slogan, said he expected to deliver more than 20,000 signed forms — several thousand more than were required — to the team’s headquarters Thursday. The club will then analyse each form, which according to club rules had to be hand-signed and accompanied by a copy of each member’s identification document, before pronouncing the official count.
 Local restrictions on public gatherings because of the coronavirus, including a ban on spectators at Barcelona’s Camp Nou stadium, had complicated the already difficult task of accumulating more than 16,500 signatures, or 15% of the club’s eligible voter base, within two weeks. But such is the strength of opposition to Bartomeu and the club board that the group comfortably surpassed the required tally by Thursday’s 6 p.m. deadline.
 Collecting the signatures required a complex logistical operation in which stacks of forms were left at more than 130 locations across Catalonia, the region in northeastern Spain that is home to Barcelona. Once the forms were signed and the required documents were attached, the campaigners then had to transport them back to the group’s headquarters to be verified and counted.
 “We had been receiving lots of papers coming from those places that they were sent, thousands — 5, 6, 7,000 a day — and then receiving 300 or 400 people we had not previously registered at our office,” said Duch, who had taken time off from his full-time job as an accountant to focus on the campaign. As the deadline neared, workers stayed later and later as more disgruntled club members dropped by with their forms. “Yesterday we closed at 11:30 p.m.,” Duch said, “and that was the final push we needed.”
 Supporter anger at Barcelona has been growing for some time as poor results on the field competed with boardroom infighting for headlines in the Spanish news media. But the campaign to oust Bartomeu reached a new stage after a disastrous week in August, in which the team was thrashed by Bayern Munich, 8-2, in the Champions League and Lionel Messi, perhaps the best football player of all time, announced his intention to leave the club. (Messi later reversed course and said he would stay, but in doing so blamed Bartomeu for breaking his word to him.)
 Voters, Duch said, signed on because they could not stomach any more humiliation for a team that not long ago was seen as the gold standard in the world’s most popular sport. “They are saying, ‘I’m tired of them and I don’t want them to ruin it anymore, I don’t want them to pull the club into the abyss.”
 Removing a board that has been duly elected is no easy task, though. If Barcelona agrees that enough signatures have been collected — Duch expects between 5% and 10% of the ballots will be rejected — a minimum of 10% of Barcelona’s more than 140,000 members must participate in the vote of no confidence. In that vote, the motion would need a two-thirds majority to pass.
 Still, the censure motion appears to have attracted widespread support, including from three candidates seeking to replace Bartomeu, whose current six-year mandate does not expire until next spring, and also former President Joan Laporta, who oversaw the team’s rise to success under former coach Pep Guardiola and a clutch of homegrown talent that included Messi.
 Victor Font, a technology entrepreneur and one of the front-runners to replace Bartomeu, has pressed the importance of immediate change, suggesting that if elections are not held before the end of the year, Messi could renew his effort to leave the club. Messi can sign a precontract agreement with another team as soon as January; Manchester City was among the suitors who expressed interesting in signing him last month.
 “I thought the defeat in Lisbon was the bottom, but the bottom-bottom was having the best player in the history of the sport, who has been 20 years in the club, wanting to leave after such a defeat and through the back door,” Font said in a recent interview.
 Whoever wins the battle for Barcelona’s leadership faces a slew of immediate issues beyond the fate of Messi. The club’s finances, including the world’s largest player payroll, will need to be reevaluated; key sponsorship agreements — including with the team’s principal sponsor, Rakuten — will be up for renewal; a contentious and hugely expensive stadium refurbishment will need to be addressed; and, perhaps most important for the team’s fans, the roster will need to be rebuilt. But so will the club’s battered image.
 Bartomeu took over in 2014, stepping up from a vice president’s role after his ally Sandro Rosell was forced to step down amid claims of improper conduct in the signing of Brazilian forward Neymar. Earlier this month, Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported that police in Catalonia were investigating Bartomeu for corruption.
 Should Bartomeu’s opponents succeed in ousting the current leadership in voting that will have to be tailored to abide by pandemic restrictions on public gatherings, elections would have to take place within three months. Until then, the team would be in the hands of an emergency board, which would not be able to take any major decisions.
 To the rebel campaigners, though, the short-term disruption to the club’s operations will have been worthwhile. Duch pointed out that the numbers of signatures were far higher than any of his group had expected.
 “I’m surprised by the size of the final number,” he said. “We were expecting it to be close.”
 The additional votes, he said, will provide a buffer for as many as 10% of the total tally to be declared void. Under the club’s bylaws there are strict regulations over how the paperwork can be presented, including a demand that copies of the front and back of identity cards be stapled to each ballot.
 For now, it is a case of waiting. The results should be announced before Barcelona plays its first game of the new league season Sept. 27.

St. Vincent Place is appealing for donations to help its newly-launched program to feed hungry students when its 10th annual Big Blue Box food drive happens Saturday.
 Lunches for Learning started earlier this month.
 Eighty-one students from 44 families were helped in the program’s first week.
 St. Vincent then limited help to 30 families in the second week. All spots were taken with 54 students assisted. Youth from 27 families were helped this week.
 "It would be just too high to be sustainable week after week doing that many people,” said marketing and fundraising coordinator Sara McCleary of helping everyone seeking assistance. St.Vincent Place will keep the limit at 30 families for now “and see how that goes” with public support monitored.
 "We’re going to sit down, reevaluate every couple of weeks,” said McCleary.
 Help is offered on a first-come, first-served basis. Anyone interested can call McCleary at 705-253-2770, ext. 4. Deadline is each Thursday at 11 a.m.
 "Kids are able to be sent to school with the lunch that they need to not be hungry at school,” McLeary told The Sault Star.
 She fears “a stigma” related to students seen by their peers accessing food at school. McCleary wants Lunches for Learning to stop the possibility of students not seeking the food they need because of negative reaction from their peers.
 "They’re just like any other kid,” she said. “Nobody knows their family got (the food) from us. They’re there with a lunch and they’re not hungry and can focus on school.”
 Sault Ste. Marie residents can help St. Vincent Place by putting donations in a box or bag curbside by 10 a.m. Saturday.
 Donations of granola bars, cookies, pudding cups, fruit cups and crackers can help Lunches for Learning. Items should not have peanuts.
 Hygiene items, including shampoo, conditioner and toothpaste, are sought for St. Vincent Place’s food bank.
 Demand for help has picked up in early September. St. Vincent Place’s food bank ususally sees five to nine families in the first two weeks of a month. So far in September, St. Vincent Place is helping a minimum of 13 families each time its food bank opens.
 "Not a huge increase, but it adds up,” said McCleary.
 She pegs higher grocery costs and cash needed for back-to-school supplies, including face masks, as possible reasons why more people want help from St. Vincent Place.
 Forty-one pairs of drivers and runners will pick up donations Saturday morning. St. Volunteers from St. Jerome Catholic Church have helped pick up food in the city’s east. But many parishoners who help are older and have opted not to participate this year due to COVID-19.
 Sorters who handle donations at St. Vincent Place will be limited to 20 this year due to the pandemic. McCleary expects volunteers will need to return Sunday and possibly during the week to process all the food. That’s because there’s fewer helpers due to social distancing requirements and the absence of volunteers from St. Jerome’s who would sort food at the Carmel Road church.
 Up to 50 sorters could assist at St. Vincent Place, but McCleary wants to allow extra room for some regular volunteers who have health issues.
 "I might as well make it as safe as possible and not bring in a really huge crowd of people,” she said. “We’ll just take it easy. When we get done, we’ll get done.”
 Big Blue Box drive set a record in 2019 with $34,000 of food donated. The drive is crucial to keeping the shelves of St. Vincent Place’s food bank full.
 "It is very important heading into fall and winter when the need really picks up,” said McCleary. “You see a lot more people coming to the food bank in the fall and winter.”
 The assistance is driven by increased heating costs during the cold weather and putting cash aside for Christmas gifts.
 In 2019, St. Vincent Place saw demand go from 149 families helped in June to 159 in July, 167 in August and 197 in October.
 St.Vincent Place also saw a jump in families seeking help when COVID-19 hit last winter. Demand climbed from 155 families to 256 in March before dipping to 150 in April. Help sought in the fourth month of the year was “still a little higher” than usual, said McCleary.
 A second wave of COVID-19 would put even more stress on St. Vincent Place to feed the hungry.
 "We definitely need to fill the shelves now when we can,” said McCleary.
 Cash donations can also help Big Blue Box drive. Contributions can be made online at canadahelps.org. Mention Big Blue Box in the message to St. Vincent Place.

This is one of the most basic sets of opposites we learn from a young age, mapped onto the daily rhythms of day and night and, here in northern New England, the seasonal rhythms of summer and winter. An ancient distinction embedded in many of the world’s origin stories — including Genesis’ ‘let there be light’ — these words have endured not only as descriptions of the natural world, but as powerful metaphors in human life. This Sunday, we’ll dig deeper into this enduring binary, and the effect of its application to human bodies and communities. How do these qualities relate to our history of racial caste and our ongoing institutional racism? How might we reclaim the value of ‘darkness’ in our lives and in our culture?”

He's dealt with colorful remarks from players, parents and coaches.


  As a 16-year-old referee, Jackson Wolff’s no stranger to tension from his calls in the game. However, he maintains a good perspective and positive attitude when he's on and off the court.


  "Parents get so competitive sometimes," said Wolff. "It's pretty crazy, but I totally understand. I've got a lot more empathy now for officials."


  Wolff serves as the ninth candidate for the "Tag ... you are it!” feature series. He was nominated by his friend, Justin Cox. As a referee, he travels all over southwest Missouri for junior high school games.


  "I go to different school districts and ref with my Dad," said Wolff. "It's mostly junior high school. I haven't upgraded to the big leagues just yet, but that's where I am right now."


  Wolff’s father, Rob, who’s also the principal of Ezard Elementary in Conway, has been a referee for college games for many years. That’s how Wolff got on board with it, which was last year when he turned 16-years-old.


  "I just started it last year," said Wolff. "When you go in there, it's a whole different world. You put on those black-and-white striped shirts, the ugly black pants and get your stern look on. That’s definitely out of character for me."


  To become an official, Wolff said he had to pass the Missouri High School Sports and Activities (MSHSAA) exam. It took him about an hour to complete the two-part test, but it offered an open book format.


  "That part was pretty nice, having an open book test," said Wolff. "It was challenging trying to find where the answers were in the book."


  As a referee, Wolff said a majority of the calls he makes in the games are fouls, out of bounds and traveling. When asked what his favorite memory or game was, Wolff said, "I don't know. They're all pretty fun. Every games different and you never know what’s going to happen."


  Wolff has volunteered as a coach for the Upward basketball program at Marshfield First Baptist Church, but he really enjoys teaching the kindergarteners at the Strafford Sports Complex.


  "With the little kids, you get to explain basketball," said Wolff. "You're not being a referee in that one. You just get to tell them how things work on the court. It's a lot more fun to be with the kids."


  Aside from the referee gig, Wolff loves to play instruments, including the guitar, drums, piano and bass guitar. He’s also developed his skills in the production side of music.


  "I got really good at recording music," said Wolff. "I build songs, like the ones you hear on the radio. I even write some jingles, so I guess you can call me a part-time jingle writer. I did a few jingles for the school. I've been contracted by the school three times. I wrote one for the fall fest, then I did one about our school's reopening plan and how to understand the colors. Then I did one for teacher appreciation video."


  Wolff has always been interested in the music. He started playing drums when he was four-years old. He performs for church worship services, talent shows and other events.


  "I play guitar for the school's jazz band," said Wolff. "I also play drums for Ward Lawson. He’s got a little band and we play together. Sometimes, I just play by myself. I've performed at Reunion Fest a couple times, the Webster County Fair talent show and other events. I just love playing. When you're up there, everything else just goes away."


  When he's not doing that, Wolff gives swim lessons at the Marshfield Aquatic Center and private lessons with individuals. He's also a bookkeeper for Tackett and Tackett Accounting.


  "Robbie Tackett is my mom’s cousin," said Wolff. "John Tackett is my mom's uncle. They're family and they needed a bookkeeper, so I jumped on board. With the bookkeeping, I make sure people get paid the right amount and that everything lines up."


  _Tag, you're it! Jackson Wolff has nominated his friend, Ward Lawson, for next week’s feature. Watch this space!_

High school sports in northern Vermont are set to kick off later than initially expected this month.
 The return to school on Sept. 8 also signaled the start of practice for fall sports squads at high schools across the Green Mountain State. Some of those teams, particularly in southern Vermont, were given the green light to compete against other schools as soon as Sept. 21.
 That’s not the case in the northern half of the state though; the Northern Vermont Athletic Conference, the governing body for about 40 schools big and small located above an invisible line stretching from Thetford to Middlebury, has decided to hold off an extra week and start competitions between schools in all sports beginning on Sept. 28.

One of the propositions placed on the ballot by lawmakers, Prop 16 would mark a return to affirmative action in California after it was banned in 1996 when voters approved Prop 209. The outcome of Prop 16 would have significant ramifications for the state’s colleges and universities. Under current law, the state is prohibited from considering race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting. The mandate of Prop 209 has long been a target of civil rights activists. It was placed the ballot after a contentious debate among lawmakers this summer.

SPOKANE, Wash. - One man is in jail after Spokane Police officers responded to a terrifying domestic violence call on the South Hill.
 Police received a call about the incident in the early morning hours of Wednesday, Sept. 17. When officers were responding to the 2600 block of Keystone Ct., they learned that a man at the location has had a history with police.
 James House, 54, was already wanted for felony harassment, assault and cyber stalking.
 Once officers arrived at the residence, they were unable to get anybody to answer the door and made an exigent entry. Once inside, they found the victim and House in a bedroom.
 The victim was pleading for help with House on top of her. Officers were able to quickly take him into custody.
 The subsequent investigation revealed that House and the victim had a previous relationship. However, House does not live at the Keystone Ct. home. Instead, the victim woke up and found House inside the residence.

Brenda DiGiovanni passed away peacefully at the age of 79 Wednesday, Sept. 16, 2020, in Southern Pines.
 The youngest daughter of William K. and Ione (Williams) Albrecht, she was born Brenda Lynn Albrecht on Jan. 28, 1941, in Monticello, N.Y., and graduated from Monticello High School in 1958. She was nostalgic of her upstate roots, often recounting stories of growing up in the heyday of festive towns and summer resorts dotted amongst the Catskill Mountains. Brenda received her bachelor’s degree in physical education from the Cortland State Teacher’s College (now the State University of New York at Cortland) in 1963.
 Brenda accepted a teaching position at Hueneme High School in Oxnard, Calif., in 1963. While in California she met Philip J. DiGiovanni of Nanuet, N.Y., who was serving in the U.S. Navy in San Diego. The couple married on Nov. 21, 1964, in Monticello, and settled in Rockland County, N.Y. Brenda taught in the school districts of Pearl River and North Rockland, and served on the Good Samaritan Hospital Guild in Suffern. She was also a hostess at the General Electric Pavilion in the New York World’s Fair. She would later spend 16 years as the office manager of her husband’s dental practice.

BROCKTON -- Gunshots rang out in broad daylight near restaurants and a busy shopping area Thursday afternoon.


  ShotSpotter, the city's electronic gunfire detection system, alerted police to 19 rounds of gunfire in the area of 675 Crescent St., near the unopened Boiling Catch restaurant and McDonald's, just west of the Crescent Plaza, which houses the Home Depot and Shaw's, at about 4:25 p.m.

  Dispatch sent all available cruisers to the scene and alerted responding officers that it sounded like an exchange of gunfire on the ShotSpotter audio.


  Police also received several 911 calls, including from people who said a man in a black SUV was shooting at another vehicle from the area of the McDonald's.


  Police located more than a dozen shell casings scattered across Crescent Street and at the entrance to Boiling Catch, which is located at the site of the former Papa Gino's.


  A silver Infiniti was struck by the gunfire and remained at the scene. Police say the black SUV fled the scene east on Crescent Street into Whitman.


  "Patrol officers and detectives apprehended two individuals while investigating the shooting at 675 Crescent St.," said police spokesman Darren Duarte. "Police seized illicit drugs from the suspects."


  Police say one victim found near the scene declined to be taken to the hospital. It's unclear what the nature of his injuries were.


  "Charges related to the discharge of a firearm(s) may be pending at a later date," Duarte said.


  A sheriff's deputy with the Plymouth County Bureau of Criminal Investigation responded to photograph the scene and document evidence.


  Anyone with information on the shooting is asked to contact Brockton police detectives at 508-941-0234. Tips can be submitted anonymously via text message by sending the word "BROCKTON" and the tip information to "CRIMES" (274637).

 But Kreher avoided incarceration and was given a 24-month probation sentence instead Thursday after his defense lawyer told the judge there were lingering questions about whether the 50-year-old defendant was really driving this time.
 “Part of the reason why there is a probation offer in this case … is when Mr. Kreher was arrested later that evening, shortly after the accident, he indicated someone else was driving the vehicle,” said attorney Philip Tibbs, defending Kreher in Macon County Circuit Court.

 NEW YORK/BOSTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Riverstone Holdings LLC, one of the oil and gas sector's largest private equity investors, is planning a blank-check acquisition company that will buy a business in the clean energy industry, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
 The move illustrates how some private equity firms that have placed big bets on hydrocarbons, a sector battered by low oil prices and rising investor awareness of climate change, are increasingly focused on deploying capital into greener projects.
 A buyout firm founded 20 years ago by Goldman Sachs Group Inc veterans, and which is backed by the investment bank, Riverstone is in the process of establishing a so-called special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), the sources said.
 The new entity will raise money from investors in an initial public offering (IPO), which will form the basis of a war chest to buy a privately owned clean energy business, the sources said. A formal announcement about the venture could come as soon as October, two of the sources added.
 Riverstone declined to comment.
 Many clean energy companies have sought mergers with SPACs in recent months, a move allowing them to go public at a time when either their own operations or the technology they use is still in the early stages of development.
 Investors have poured cash into SPACs buying such firms, hoping their investment can become the next Tesla Inc, the electric vehicle startup that is now the world's most valuable automaker.
 Riverstone's SPAC will be the buyout firm's fourth such entity, the previous three being oil and gas-focused. The trio raised between $450 million and $1.04 billion at their respective IPOs, and the latest is expected to be in the same range, one of the sources said.
 The firm's previous SPACs have had mixed results.
 Centennial Resource Development Inc, an oil producer in the prolific Permian basin, was worth more than double the Riverstone SPAC's IPO price as recently as October 2018, before subsiding investor support for the U.S. shale sector dragged down the company's valuation.
 Alta Mesa Holdings, an Oklahoma-focused producer, filed for bankruptcy in September 2019, less than two years after Riverstone's second SPAC completed its $3.8 billion merger with the company.
 Despite its oil and gas heritage, Riverstone has also deployed significant money into the renewable energy space for more than a decade. Among its bets was Pattern Energy, which was bought earlier this year by Canadian pension fund CPPIB in a deal worth $6.1 billion including debt.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Robert Woods is off to another strong start with the Los Angeles Rams in a career that has always exceeded expectations, and his team is planning to reward him for it.
 Rams coach Sean McVay on Thursday all but guaranteed Woods will get a contract extension soon, keeping another franchise cornerstone in his native Los Angeles for the long term.
 The 28-year-old Woods is already signed through 2021 in a deal that pays him $9 million next season, but the Rams have been determined to bump up Woods' pay to a level commensurate with his achievements and leadership for the team. Los Angeles already reached a deal last week with Woods' counterpart, receiver Cooper Kupp, who got a three-year, $48 million extension through 2023.
 “We want to get (Woods) extended, too,” McVay said. “He’s a huge part of what we’re doing. That’s something I think is definitely important. … Robert and Cooper have been pillars of what we’ve done the last few years. It’s great to get Cooper under contract. I’m so happy for him, and you can expect to see something similar down the line here very shortly we’re working toward for Robert.”
 Woods' speed, consistency and precision have made him one of the NFL's most productive receivers since he joined his hometown Rams in 2017 from Buffalo, where he spent his first four seasons.
 The Southern California product had a career-high 1,219 yards receiving with six touchdowns in 2018, and he followed it up last year with 1,134 yards and two more scores on a career-high 90 receptions. McVay frequently targets him for receiver screens, and Woods also features regularly in the Rams' running game on jet sweeps, carrying the ball 36 times in the last two years.

In addition to the extra session, lawmakers also returned to the State Capitol this week for the annual veto session. Usually a one-day affair, this session gives the members of the Missouri General Assembly the opportunity to reconsider any legislation vetoed by the governor. Following the completion of the 2020 legislative session, the governor vetoed two bills and issued 17 line-item vetoes — totaling more than $11 million — to the state’s 2021 operating budget. While the House of Representatives successfully voted to overturn one of the governor’s line-item vetoes to House Bill 2004, the Senate did not take up the same motion. At the end of the day, lawmakers did not override any of the governor’s vetoes. While our state constitution grants the governor the authority to veto any legislation passed by the General Assembly, lawmakers have the ability to overturn a governor’s veto through a two-thirds vote in both chambers. In my opinion, the ability to override a governor’s veto plays an important role in our government’s system of checks and balances.

"When you go to Philadelphia, it's the cradle of American democracy," said Whitaker. It was the very first state to have vote by mail. President Trump who is campaigning in the state and has been there four or five times this summer and every time he is there he says mail-in ballots are not safe. That has injected a lot of confusion in the process. We found a lot of people scratching their heads saying 'is this safe, is this going to work.' There are questions about the mail service. All of these questions are still up in the air and Election Day is six weeks away."

"We will study the executive order and will look forward to analyzing the opportunities and risks that may present themselves when we move to Plan A for grades pre-K through 5,” said Grimesey. “That analysis will include a complete review of operational requirements and how we can ensure the safety of our students and employees.
 "Any recommendation to expand the number of students participating in daily in-person instruction must be measured, thoughtful and informed by guidance from the CDC, the NCDHHS and the Moore County Department of Health. To that end, we will continue to work closely with the Moore County Department of Health with each step of the way."
 Middle and high schools will still be limited to hybrid learning plans on Plan B for the time being.
 Research on viral transmission suggests that children under the age of 10 are less likely to spread the coronavirus. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, said that’s another factor in the state’s decision to allow elementary schools to fully reopen.
 “Studies show that there seems to be less viral transmission from children back to their household or from children to other children that they are around. Again, it’s less likely, but that doesn’t mean we eliminate risk,” said Cohen.
 “We have higher benefit, lower risk and that is what’s making us say we can go forward with kindergarten through fifth grade at this time.”
 Plan B also requires schools to limit the number of students on buses to one per seat. Only siblings living in the same household can sit two to a seat. Under the new guidance, it is “strongly recommended” that elementary schools operating under Plan A continue to follow those guidelines for transportation.
 Moore County Schools has been among the 50 or so districts in North Carolina to reopen under Plan B. The specifics of those partial reopenings vary from district to district, but they all involve schools operating at roughly half of their usual capacity.
 “Moore County Schools is very proud to have reopened schools last month. Less than half the districts in the state have been able to accomplish what we have in terms of starting the year with a hybrid model for in-person and remote instruction, and a fully virtual option as an alternative choice for students,” Grimesey said.
 More than half of the public school districts in the state have refrained from bringing students back into classrooms. Instead, their teachers have delivered instruction only virtually.
 All districts have been required to offer a fully online curriculum as an option for families. About 3,600 Moore County students, or a third of the district, are enrolled in online learning only for the entire first semester.
 As of Wednesday, Moore County Schools has recorded 36 COVID-19 cases among students and staff at 12 schools since the start of the school year.
 “So far we have seen no evidence of classroom spread,” said Grimesey. “We have proven that if we follow the guidance for wearing masks, practicing social distancing and washing our hands often, we can minimize the spread of COVID-19 and return our students to classrooms and our employees to work.”

Hubbard believes there will be a good transition with the new city manager working alongside Dorn for a couple months and the new deputy city manager likely having time to work with him. Plus, Hubbard said, he is staying local and will be available for questions should they arise.
 “I really have enjoyed it. I’ve had different roles here over the years and this has been a real home for me,” Hubbard said. “It’s a very supportive community.”
 But with more than half a year left in the position, there’s no shortage of work for Dorn and Hubbard to wrap up. Dorn wants to keep a sharp focus on the city’s budget and finances. South Burlington is on track to potentially close out fiscal year 2020 in the black even with challenges from COVID-19.
 “The more difficult fiscal year we think is going to be the current one we’re in, fiscal 21, and so dealing with fiscal challenges is probably going to be the hallmark of the year ahead for us,” Dorn said.
 As for his proudest accomplishment in the role? Dorn believes that there’s greater stability now than several years ago.
 “I think I came in at a time of great instability, in municipal government and I think Tom and I are leaving at a time of stability, both financial stability, human resource stability, programmatic stability and I think the community is in a good place,” he said.
 But he was quick to share the credit across all city departments and levels.
 “Nobody does anything by themselves. It’s a team effort,” he said. “We’ve got an extraordinary team across the board.”
 Now, the council will set to work creating a job posting for city manager.
 “I hope we’ll find someone with similar talents,” Riehle said. “They are both so professional and really dedicated to the city.”
 While Dorn and Hubbard didn’t always agree with the council, at times sharing their concerns, they always professionally carried out what the council decided and didn’t allow their personal preferences to “get in the way,” she added.
 “Specifically, for Kevin; he is really creative and always thinking about future possibilities. I really cherish that,” Riehle said. “He really kind of understands city government and the possibilities, how it can effectively lead a community.”
 Hubbard’s retirement will mean a loss for the city in terms of historical perspective, she continued.
 “Plus, they’re just fun to work with. They both have great senses of humor and really care about the city. I just think they’re both really talented,” Riehle said.

Woolworths Holdings is reviewing its South African clothing business and the food division of Australian unit David Jones in a bid to stem losses amid a slump in earnings, its chief executive said.


  Roy Bagattini, who took over as CEO of the fashion and food retailer in February, is on a mission to improve the performance of the David Jones department store chain.


  His predecessor Ian Moir paid a premium to bulk up in Australia and turn the company into a leading southern hemisphere retailer.


  "Although some progress has been made, our David Jones business has simply not transitioned fast enough," Mr Bagattini told analysts on Thursday after Woolworths reported a 65 per cent drop in annual earnings.


  Woolworths announced a review of its Australian real estate assets in May, a process that would include restructuring debt.


  On Thursday, Mr Bagattini announced a number of new plans, giving investors a peek into his thinking about the Australian business.


  While the roll-out of a partnership with BP Garage aimed at capturing convenience shoppers was progressing well, the larger format David Jones food business continues to be loss-making, necessitating a review.


  At a minimum, Mr Bagattini said he hoped the review would get the business to "a break-even position during the 2022 financial year."


  Woolworths has also started a range of "cost-out" initiatives to take at least $A20 million of costs out of the Australian businesses on an annualised basis.


  The company has received several non-binding offers for the sale and leaseback of the remaining real estate of David Jones, which would help the unit reduce borrowing needs and pay down debt.


  Woolworths, which also owns the Country Road brand, is also reviewing the strategy and execution of its struggling South African fashion, beauty and home business.


  The goal would be "fixing and repositioning" a division plagued by poor fashion "mistakes" over the past two years, it said.


  Mr Bagattini said whilst poor execution was to blame, Woolworths' challenges lie in strategy, which for too long ignored new young, vibrant and aspiring customers.


  "As a business, we have not evolved fast enough and that's left us somewhat behind the curve," he said.


  The review will seek to address relatively long and inflexible lead times - the time it takes to produce clothes - in order to better react to fast-moving customer trends, he said.

As city manager and deputy city manager, respectively, Dorn and Hubbard have seen the city through goals like creating a walkable downtown — now in progress as City Center.
 News of the retirements was shared publicly on Sept. 8, when city councilors discussed a timeline for their retirement. A search committee is expected to begin work in December for Dorn’s replacement, with a new manager named likely by April.
 Under that timeline, the newcomer would start in early May, allowing them two months to train alongside Dorn and two months to select a deputy city manager, City Council Chair Helen Riehle explained.
 “There’s a cost to that, but I think it’s a bigger cost to not do that and just have someone come in cold and have to learn the ropes,” she said.
 Reached by phone, Dorn explained his decision to step down.
 “My contract expires on June 30 and so my wife I just thought why not just have this be the last contract,” Dorn said. “She’s going to retire as well. We’re just at the point in our lives where we want to think about retirement and do some other things.”
 Dorn is 64 years old and Hubbard will turn 63 in November.
 Their post-career plans are still in the works, but travel and winter in Florida might be on the docket.
 Hubbard has been considering retirement since the end of his last contract.
 “I wanted to go out still feeling like I was contributing to the city and still feeling good about what it is that I’m doing, and I still do,” he said. “I’ve heard other people who have retired say, ‘Oh I stayed a couple years too long,’ or that kind of thing. I don’t want to be one of those people.”
 Hubbard is looking forward to spending more time with his wife and grandchildren. But he’s not counting down the days, as he starts to experience his first lasts as deputy city manager.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — New York Giants running back Saquon Barkley is getting something new in his game — criticism.
 Barkley has been under fire this week after gaining 6 yards on 15 carries in a season-opening 26-16 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
 The yardage total was the second worst of his brief NFL career, and one of the worst in the past 20 years when a back had 15 carries.
 There's more. The 2017 NFL offensive rookie of the year came under fire from former Giants running back Tiki Barber. The current Hall of Fame candidate said Barkley's pass blocking was so poor he did not deserve to be on the field all three downs. What had to be even tougher to hear was Barber saying the third-year running back was a big back who didn't like to hit.
 After practice on Thursday, Barkley refused to snap back at Barber, saying he had the right to speak his mind. He even admitted he missed a block or two. He also said the criticism didn't bother him.
 “When I say I don't care, I truly don't care about other people's opinions,” Barkley said. “I know you can ask my teammates, anyone in this building, they won't question my toughness.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department has sent a memo to U.S. attorneys emphasizing that federal prosecutors should aggressively go after demonstrators who cause violence — and even sedition charges could potentially apply. The memo says the sedition statute doesn't require proof of a plot to overthrow the government. Instead, it could be used when a defendant tries to oppose the government's authority by force. The memo was sent Thursday and was obtained by The Associated Press. Attorney General William Barr has been pushing U.S. attorneys to bring federal charges in protest-related violence whenever they can. Federal convictions often result in longer prison sentences, and sedition alone can lead to up to 20 years behind bars.

With some 535,000 members, the group says governments should stop “defaulting to overtime as a solution and change the provider-to-patient requirement to a more suitable ratio. “The Quebec government needs to stop putting its head in the sand” says Réseau FADOQ president Gisèle Tassé-Goodman. “Burnout is a direct consequence of these ratio problems. It should immediately adopt a law on provider-to-patient ratios, which will improve health care over the medium and the long term.”
 FADOQ says inspiring and recruiting the next generation of workers will be key, in particular students completing secondary school. “We need to attract young people to healthcare professions. We need to promote these professions to get more students enrolling in the right programs now, so the healthcare system can reap the benefits down the road.”
 This begins they say, “by reorganizing the work, ending mandatory overtime, and putting in place more humane provider-to-patient ratios so staff can spend more time actually providing care. Less assembly-line care should translate to more quality time with patients.”

But with the onset of the pandemic, the day-to-day life as a college student I was accustomed to has been turned upside down. Adjusting to virtual learning has left me wondering what our current situation could mean for the future of higher education.
 One thing that this experience has highlighted is the critical role higher education will play for many who consider re-enrolling or continuing their postsecondary journey to make them competitive for jobs in a post-COVID economy, including me.
 Over the past few months, I have thought a lot about the investment students commit to when we pursue a postsecondary degree. It’s an investment of our time, but also money. When I was deciding where to attend college, it would have been helpful to have resources to compare how schools across the state, and country, perform so I could have more adequately and easily gauged which schools presented a better match for my goals and objectives. It only seems fair that students, on the brink of committing years of their lives and thousands of dollars annually, should be able to determine the grades and other success metrics that the colleges and universities provide.
 Information like enrollment numbers, graduation rates, post-graduate debt repayment, and employment outcomes would give students a preview of what kind of return on investment their degree might yield. I am fortunate enough to attend a university that is transparent about these metrics, but many students are not in the same boat. Attending college is supposed to put students one step ahead, but in some cases, students attend predatory schools who are only interested in our tuition checks. Those students, victimized by diploma mills, end up with nothing more than a mountain of debt and a degree that doesn’t help them in the long run.
 According to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education, almost half of our state’s schools fail to graduate more than half of the students who enrolled eight years prior. Put simply, that isn’t a passing grade. As students, we deserve a level of transparency and accountability when we entrust our time and money to a school.
 Lawmakers in Washington agree and introduced the College Transparency Act, legislation that would go a long way toward ensuring that students, like myself, have access to key information before deciding what university, college, or technical program we might want to pursue. As an undergraduate enrolled in one of our state’s higher ed institutions, I appreciate the efforts being made to enact these student-centric changes to the postsecondary education system that we deserve.
 As many of us consider continuing our postsecondary journey and others enter the workforce, it’s reassuring to know we have champions in Washington who understand the value of a quality education.

A decade ago, the idea of citizens’ assemblies may have been dismissed by sceptics as pie in the sky. Here in Australia, the idea of a citizens’ assembly may have been tarnished by its identification with a partisan agenda, such as when former prime minister Julia Gillard called for a citizens’ assembly on climate change. But today, citizens’ assemblies have begun to establish a credible track record.

The play, which portrays Maryk’s court-martial for mutiny, centers on the cross-examination of Queeg by Barney Greenwald, counsel for the defense. It was a hit on Broadway, running for 415 performances, and Lloyd Nolan, a B-movie semi-star who played Queeg, received hats-off raves from every critic in town. When he died in 1985, all of the obits led with his performance as Queeg. Alas, Nolan was passed over for the 1954 film version, in which Humphrey Bogart played Queeg, and it is Bogart’s Queeg that is remembered today, with Nolan’s relegated to the small print of theatrical history.

"Districts will have the ability to select a plan based on their unique situation," Cooper said. "We're able to open this option because most North Carolinians have doubled down on our safety and prevention measures and stabilized our numbers. The science of lower viral spread among children also backs up this decision."
