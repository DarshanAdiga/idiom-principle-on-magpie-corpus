And once inside? I was surprised to find that the usually clever sets at GALA, this one by Clifton Chadick, is entirely enclosed in plexiglass. We're not watching Zoom for once, but we are still watching a box. Thanks to a tilt, and the lighting of Alberto Segarra, it's not completely noticeable as, say, the plexiglass at your drugstore cashier checkout, though the actors, unmasked but using individual microphones, sometimes use the transparent wall as an intended plane to push against.

Illinois football coach Lovie Smith said Monday the team has had no new positive COVID-19 tests among players after two infected players missed Saturday's game against Purdue.
 A staff member also previously tested positive, according to a team spokesman. The staffer, who was not identified, is not a coach.
 Twelve other players had to sit out the 31-24 loss to Purdue, with seven of them quarantined because of contact tracing.
 "With the amount of guys (out), you only have so many players," Smith said in a video call with reporters. "We can't afford any others. We can't afford to have another group go out. We're right at the border to be able to really practice the way we would like. At a few positions, we're right at the minimum amount."

NEW ORLEANS, La. (WVUE) - The Tigers 2020 season hit a new low at Auburn after suffering a 37-point loss. LSU’s record sits at 2-3, with highly ranked Alabama on the horizon.“You gotta dig deep man. It hurts, it hurts everybody, but I’m the leader. I’m going to be positive with our football players. I’m going to show them the film. We’ll tell them where we could’ve coached better. Tell them where we have to execute better. We got to make better in-game adjustments. We got to continue to grow,” said Ed Orgeron.The big question mark going into the Tide-Tigers matchup is will Myles Brennan play. He’s missed two games so far with a partially torn oblique muscle.“We’re going to throw the ball with him a little today. Try to get into the offense, see what he can do. He’s not ready yet. It’s day-by-day. I don’t know if he’s going to be ready for the Alabama game. I think we’ll know a little bit more next week. We’re going to try to let him do some things today, see how he can do it,” said Orgeron.LSU already possesses one victory over Alabama this season, be that on the recruiting trail. The No. 1 safety in the country, Sage Ryan, picked the Tigers over the Tide this past weekend.Obviously we’re very pleased what happened this weekend. A big battle. I got to give credit to Kevin Faulk, Corey Raymond, and Derek Ponamsky. Those guys did a tremendous job. It’s always going to be a fight to keep our best players in Louisiana," said Orgeron.LSU’s 2021 recruiting class is ranked No. 4 in the country. So far they have 21 commits.Copyright 2020 WVUE.
