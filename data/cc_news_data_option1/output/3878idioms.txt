Strategic communications firms like WPP's Finsbury, Publicis' Kekst CNC, TrailRunner International, and Gladstone Place Partners specialize in high- stress assignments like clients' IPOs and shareholder revolts, and seek employees who thrive on pressure and are interested in business.


  These firms use the interview process to test job candidates' intellectual curiosity, commitment to their job, and culture fit.


  Former and current employees at these firms shared the hardest questions people can expect in an interview, based on their own experiences interviewing for a job or conducting an interview there.


  The kinds of questions depend on the seniority of the role. Where junior candidates should expect questions about their academic experience, senior candidates can expect ones about how they've helped clients in the past.


  But overall, the questions are meant to weed out candidates with a low interest in high-level public relations work, who are unwilling to work long hours, and won't get along with their colleagues.


  ## Why do you want to work here?


  Strategic communications firm usually ask candidates why they want to work there.


  First, it shows if the candidates have done their research, said Karla Wagner, head of talent and human resources for North America at Finsbury.


  It also demonstrates how much the candidate knows about and is interested in this PR niche, others said.

Craig Bellamy has angrily hit back at claims Melbourne's Max King tried to injure a rival player in the Storm's 30-22 loss to St George Illawarra, labelling them ridiculous.


  The Dragons ended their sorry NRL season with a win on Sunday against an undermanned Storm, with Tyson Frizell bagging a double in his farewell game.


  But even after resting 12 of their starting 17, the Storm still have several headaches ahead of next week's qualifying final against Parramatta.


  King was placed on report for a hip-drop tackle on Blake Lawrie, which prompted him to briefly leave the field injured.


  Former Dally M Medallist Greg Alexander claimed in Fox League commentary there was "an intent to injure" from the "obvious foul play".


  The comments angered Bellamy, who has previously had to defend his team's tackling style time and time again on the eve of the finals.


  "That's ridiculous. That is ridiculous" Bellamy said.


  "I would be very disappointed if any player in the competition goes out to intentionally injure an opposition player.


  "That is ridiculous."


  The veteran coach said he had not seen the tackle properly when asked if he had concerns over whether he would be suspended.


  "I didn't see it closely," Bellamy said.


  "There were bodies entangled there. We'll have to have a look at it."


  Tui Kamikamica could also be under the microscope for a first-half shoulder charge on Jayden Sullivan after he'd passed, despite it going unpenalised on field.


  Making matters worse, Kamikamica finished the game off the field with an ankle injury.


  "I'm not quite sure how bad it is yet, but it's certainly a concern for next week," Bellamy said.


  But even while fielding the second least experienced side in the NRL era with just 547 games between them, the Storm still looked likely to win at times.


  They led 16-6 before letting the game slip in the second half, and finished the game with 12 men as Bellamy opted against putting rested players back on the field after other injuries.


  Both sides scored five tries, but the Storm were left to rue four missed conversions from stand-in skipper Ryan Papenhuyzen who was otherwise their best.


  The fullback set up their first when he sliced through the Dragons' left-edge defence and put Paul Momirovski over.


  He also threw the last pass for Chris Lewis to score another, this time catching the Dragons' right edge short with his speed.


  But after Sandor Earl and Isaac Lumelume also both crossed off kicks, Frizell's farewell party began in his 165th and final game for the Dragons before moving to Newcastle.


  He ran onto a Matt Dufty ball to make it 16-12 at the break, before the Dragons were given the lead in the second half via a penalty try to Zac Lomax.


  McInnes was the man who laid the grubber on for Lomax, as well as the Dragons' next when he burst down field and put Dufty over.


  Then after Nicho Hynes put the Storm back in the game when he grubbered for himself, Frizell cemented the Dragons' win by claiming a Sullivan kick and scoring.


  "I thought he (Frizell) was great," coach Dean Young said.


  "He had the most runs he had all year, so he obviously wanted to finish on a high."

“Now we have the agency to choose and modify the trapping locations based on the Cocopah community’s needs and also trap at more locations than before. Essentially, this is an ideal case of Cocopah teaming up with local experts to help keep our community safe,” Alspach said.


  The district and Cocopah EPO are conducting tests every two weeks. Cocopah EPO crews have been placing multiple traps on all three reservations.


  “West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States. It is most commonly spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito,” according to the Centers for Disease Control website.


  “About 1 in 5 people who are infected develop a fever and other symptoms. About 1 out of 150 infected people develop a serious, sometimes fatal, illness,” the CDC reports.


  In addition to more active surveillance, the Pest Abatement District and Cocopah EPO are partnering on a public awareness campaign to educate people what they need to do to reduce the risk of getting infected.


  The CDC says the most effective way to guard against getting bit by infected mosquitoes is to use mosquito repellent and wear long sleeve shirts and pants when going outside.


  Standing pools of water are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Public health officials advise turning over, covering, scrubbing or eliminating tires, birdbaths, containers–essentially any receptacle that can hold water.

Cosa può significare una radio durante un lockdown? Una chance di avere notizie su come proteggersi e di mantenere aperta la comunicazione, in quelle zone dove i media sono un bene raro e prezioso. È il caso di Mbinga, in Tanzania, o di Gbarnga, in Liberia, dove due radio diocesane - Radio Hekima (“Unità” in Swahili) e Radio Paraclete (“Paraclito”) - hanno cominciato a trasmettere proprio a maggio 2020, nel picco della pandemia da Covid-19. Grazie al contributo dell’8 per mille della Chiesa cattolica italiana, stanziato attraverso il fondo del Servizio per gli interventi caritativi a favore dei Paesi del terzo mondo, queste radio sono adesso operative. Dietro c’è il lavoro del team di Signis, Associazione cattolica mondiale per la comunicazione, con la sua squadra di Roma. Signis Services Rome (Ssr) ha infatti accompagnato mons. John Ndimbo, vescovo di Mbinga, e mons. Anthony Borwah, vescovo di Gbarnga, nelle varie fasi di disegno del progetto, fundraising e implementazione, fino alla piena operatività. Ora Ssr lancia la terza edizione della “Call for project ideas”, una chiamata a presentare idee progettuali con le quali iniziare un viaggio che trasformerà l’idea di una nuova radio, televisione, centro di comunicazione, in una realtà concreta e funzionante, che va ad arricchire il panorama mediatico dei Paesi più svantaggiati. La Call è infatti rivolta a quei progetti da sviluppare in aree dove la Chiesa si trova più in difficoltà. Sviluppata in partnership con Vatican News, Università Salesiana - Facoltà di Scienze della comunicazione sociale, Net-One, la Call è aperta fino al 31 ottobre 2020 ed è possibile trovare il regolamento e tutte le informazioni sul sito www.signisrome.net.

Meyer, he 6-2 junior outside hitter terminated her 1,000th kill in the second set against the Indians, which was her final of the match. Meyer stepped in to a well-placed set at the left pin from Sierra Blackburn and found the floor to the tune of an applause and Superior fans raising signs that read: “1,000 kills.”
 Shayla, who needed 14 kills to eclipse the mark, smiled as she looked into the stands and jogged back to position to play the next ball.
 “I had no clue,” Meyer said with a smile. “It’s just looking at what I can do in the future and it’s pretty exciting what I can do.”
 Meyer’s kill made the second set 14-11 in favor of the Indians, who finished the game on an 11-7 run for the 25-21, 25-17 sweep and invite title.
 Superior had a tough time stopping Broken Bow’s Kya Scott, who led the Indians with 11 kills. Setter Kailyn Scott had 20 assists.
 “Broken Bow was a really tough team,” said Superior head coach Kelsea Blevins. “We’re learning and we’re growing every single match... They have a really talented setter, so we had some trouble running against a 5-1.”
 The Wildcats reached the title game via a three-set win over Sandy Creek (27-29, 25-23, 25-20) — in which Meyer pounded 24 kills, and a comeback effort in a sweep of Class B Gering (25-15, 27-25) in the semifinals. Meyer had 15 kills in that match, including the final one.
 “We had some incredible challenges,” Blevins said. “We nearly lost our first match in three sets and we battled back from 17-24 in the second set to win our second match. The girls are just learning to play together and believe in themselves. They’re capable of incredible things.”
 Superior’s semifinal victory was Blevins’ 200th coaching the program.
 I had no idea, they completely surprised me. I don’t keep track of that,” said Blevins. “It was incredible that the girls, assistants, and parents were thinking of me. As much as our coaches give for the girls, it’s nice to feel thee love back.”
 Meyer, who is now in the Superior spotlight after her sister Kalynn’s departure to Huskers, has accounted for 261 kills in 40 sets (6.5 per set) this season.
 “It’s been better than I thought, honestly,” Meyer said. “Everyone said, ‘What are you going to do without that experienced senior class?’ But really, we’ve improved so much since the beginning of summer. I’ve been rally proud of the team and it’s just fun.”

Danny O'Brien branded rising star Russian Camelot as the best horse he had trained after his commanding win in the Group One Underwood Stakes.
 "He's the best horse I've had anything to do with. He's a magnificent colt," O'Brien said after the 1800m event.
 O'Brien pointed out that Russian Camelot was still a young horse as he was a three-year-old by northern hemisphere time and only having his seventh start.
 "It's really exciting to see him produce performances like this so early in his career," O'Brien said.
 "There's been a lot of hype around him, people are expecting things like this so it's really exciting to see him go out there and get it done."
 His jockey Damien Oliver, who recorded his 120th Group One win, said he was a perfect Cox Plate horse.
 He said it was good for a boom galloper to be fulfilling his potential so early in his career.
 "He's an exciting horse and it's a pleasure to be riding him. He could well be up to a race like the Cox Plate," Oliver said
 Russian Camelot is now a $3.50 favourite to win the Cox Plate with TAB fixed odds and an $8 equal favourite for the Melbourne Cup.
 O'Brien said he would stick to his program and the horse would have his next start in two week's time in the Caulfield Stakes and then a fortnight later in the Cox Plate.
 A decision on the Melbourne Cup will be made after that.
 In a surprise, Russian Camelot worked forward and sat second in the run behind leader Trap For Fools.
 Oliver angled him to the middle of the track and he took the lead early in the straight and outstayed his rivals.
 Russian Camelot ($1.55 fav) defeated veteran Humidor ($17) by 1-3/4 lengths with Arcadia Queen ($5.50) a half-length away third.
 O'Brien said he left the riding tactics to Oliver.
 "I got sick of talking about it. In the finish I said to Damien, 'you're the best jockey on the best horse so I'll leave it up to you to work it out,'" O'Brien said.
 Oliver described Russian Camelot as a classic weight-for-age horse as he had the ability to sit on the pace or to sit back.
 The champion jockey said he didn't have a set plan before the Underwood but when he jumped nicely he thought he should take advantage of that and push forward.

Almost a week after the worst mass stranding on record in Australia, rescuers on Tasmania's rugged west coast have guided another pilot whale to freedom.
 The mammal was set free from Macquarie Harbour on Sunday, bringing the total number of saved whales to 110.
 Crews are swiftly working to dispose of some 360 carcasses at sea after the pod of 470 got into trouble early last week.
 They will also look for remaining survivors and haven't ruled out finding more whales alive.
 "We think there may be a few still popping around that we've missed that aren't fully beached but are in distress," incident controller Robert Buck told AAP.
 About 200 carcasses were towed by several boats out of the harbour on Sunday, with authorities hopeful of removing the remainder before Wednesday when bad weather sets in.
 "Working on the west coast is extremely weather dependent, we've got the wildest ocean in the world at our front door. We've got to work within those constrains," Mr Buck said.
 CSIRO modelling has been used to determine the best spot to dump the whales, a 5-10 nautical mile stretch west of Cape Sorell.
 Mr Buck warned some carcasses may drift back to beaches in the area.
 He said there had been one shark sighting during the protracted rescue, but no unusual activity.
 Some 270 long-finned pilot whales were discovered stranded on sandbars on Monday morning and another 200 were found dead further inside the harbour two days later.
 The stranding surpasses a beaching event in 1996 involving about 320 pilot whales in Western Australia.
 Mr Buck praised rescuers for their tireless work in icy waters and rough weather.

The southwest monsoon retreated from parts of west Rajasthan and Punjab on Monday, 11 days after his normal withdrawal date, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.
 Conditions are becoming favourable for its further withdrawal from some more parts of Rajasthan and Punjab and some parts of Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh during next two to three days, the IMD said.
 “The southwest monsoon has withdrawn from some parts of west Rajasthan and Punjab today, September 28th, 2020,” it said. Dry weather is likely to prevail over parts of north India for the next five days.
 The official rainfall season in the country starts from June 1 to September 30.
 This year, the monsoon made an onset over Kerala on June 1, its normal onset date. It covered the entire country on June 26, nearly a fortnight more than its normal schedule.
 According to the revised date, the new normal date for the monsoon to cover the entire country is July 8. The earlier normal date for the monsoon to cover the entire country was July 15.
 The monsoon has also withdrawn late this year. The new normal withdrawal date for the monsoon to retreat from west Rajasthan is September 17, while the earlier normal date for the monsoon to withdraw from west Rajasthan was July 15.
 While the monsoon was retreating from parts of north India, other parts of the country will continue to receive rainfall.
 A trough runs from a cyclonic circulation over east Bihar to west-central Bay of Bengal, off Andhra Pradesh coast across Gangetic West Bengal and coastal Odisha.
 Under the influence of this system, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with moderate thunderstorm and lightning are very likely over south peninsular India during the next three days, the weatherman said.
 Isolated heavy rainfall is very likely over Tamil Nadu during the next two days, the IMD added.
 According to the weather department, monsoon is set to end on an above-normal note. Until September 27, the country had received 9% more rainfall than the normal.
 Rainfall in the range of 96-104% of the Long Period Average (LPA) is considered as ‘normal’; 104-106% of the LPA as ‘above normal’ Anything beyond 110% is considered as ‘excess’

HARTFORD, Conn —   The debate over whether students should be wearing masks in schools is headed to court Monday.      A judge will rule on the state's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the CT Freedom Alliance that alleges the school mask mandate violates the Connecticut constitution.      The lawsuit going on to list a number of other counts.      Some of those including A denial of due process, as well as a claim of negligence, saying, "the defendants have caused, or are likely to imminently cause, physical harm to the children, and emotional distress and harm to the children and the parents."      The lawsuit was filed against the State Department of Education and State Commissioner of Education Miguel Cardona.      The state released its back to school plan back in June in accordance with CDC guidelines. And according to the CDC website, masks are important to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people.      The judge will hear arguments on the state's motion to dismiss and make a ruling from the bench.      If that motion is denied, the court will then hear arguments on the CT Freedom Alliance's emergency motion for a temporary injunction.

The Washington Post


  When Troy Burner was a teenager in the late 1980s, he worked as a radiology aide at George Washington University Hospital. He also occasionally peddled crack cocaine on D.C.’s streets.


  The sporadic drug dealing, Burner said, put him under suspicion among D.C. police and made him an enemy of competing drug dealers. He said it also positioned him for a wrongful arrest and conviction in the fatal shooting of 19-year-old Michael “Bate” Wilson when Burner was 17.


  After nearly 25 years in prison, Burner gained his freedom in 2018. But he never stopped fighting to clear his name.


  D.C. Superior Court Judge Robert Rigsby weighed Burner’s petition for actual innocence and this spring reversed Burner’s conviction, saying it had been based on a “rickety” account from a purported witness who later said he’d made up the story. The judge stopped short of a full exoneration but concluded that it was “more likely than not” that Burner was innocent. Last month, prosecutors said they would not retry the case and dropped the charges.


  Burner, 48, watched the virtual court hearing in August from his computer. When heard that the charges were dismissed, tears filled his eyes. The murder case was gone.


  “It was a surreal moment. It’s been a long journey from the beginning. Even though I worked the way I worked to get to this point and I expected this to happen,” Burner said, then paused. “Just the finality of it all. I can’t really explain how I feel. I have so many emotions.”


  Seth A. Rosenthal, Burner’s pro bono attorney, said his client’s case exemplified one frequent problem in wrongful convictions — reliance on a witness seeking favor for cooperation. In Burner’s case, thekey eyewitnesswas a three-time felon who, at the time, was charged in a different murder case.


  “It demonstrates the real problems with cases that rest exclusively with cooperator testimony and how flawed those cases are,” Rosenthal said. “In these innocence cases, you often see incentivized testimonies that turn out to be false.”


  Though federal prosecutors dismissed charges against Burner, they do not consider him exonerated. “Mr. Burner has not shown that he was actually innocent,” said Shelia Miller, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney’s office.


  Wilson was killed on April 21, 1990, a year when the District had more than 470 homicides. The case went unsolved for nearly three years. Then in 1993, a man named Antoine Payton was arrested in a different murder. After being questioned by detectives, Payton told authorities he had information about Wilson’s killing.


  Using court transcripts and detectives’ notes, Burner’s attorney revealed how Payton began telling a series of varying narratives that culminated with his testifying that he saw Burner with two friends when they shot Wilson.


  Payton initially told authorities he did not see the shooting and only heard about it from friends, according to the documents. But as Payton continued to meet with detectives, his story changed. He told authorities that just after 9 p.m. that April night, he was sitting inside his parked car and he saw two men he recognized run after and shoot at Wilson and his friend in Northeast D.C.


  Three men, all friends of Burner’s, were charged.


  Prosecutors alleged that two of them, Nathaniel Harrod and Louis McCoy, were the gunmen. They said a third man, Francois Bracmort, was a drug dealer who wasn’t on the scene but ordered the killing after he heard on the street that Wilson intended to rob him.


  Burner said detectives questioned him.


  “It was a situation where I wasn’t guilty and detectives came to me and told me from off the top, ‘We know you didn’t have anything to do with this, but we need you to help us with the others,’ “ Burner said. “I didn’t know anything about the shooting, and they didn’t believe me.”


  Later, when Payton testified before a grand jury, he said he saw three, not two, assailants. For the first time, he implicated Burner in the murder. Payton again said he was in his parked car, but this timehe placed himself closer to the location of the shooting. He told the jurors that Burner was among the group he saw kill Wilson and that he remembered seeing Burner become frozen in place when the shooting began. Burner was arrested a day later.


  As the trial got underway, Payton again changed his account, this time telling jurors he was standing outside his car when the shooting began. He said he saw Burner standing behind Wilson, who began to back away when others began firing.


  Payton was the only witness who testified to seeing three men. Two other witnesses testified that they sawtwo attackers. The man who was with Wilson and was injured testified he did not remember how many people chased them.


  The trial lasted one week. Today, murder trials with multiple defendants often take several weeks. Prosecutors argued that three of the men, on orders from the fourth, chased Wilson and his friend and that two of the assailants fired, striking Wilson six times in the back. They alleged that Burner had a gun that night but did not fire it. They argued that he instead positioned himself to block Wilson from running away.


  Judge John H. Suda, who conducted the trial, denied a request by Burner’s attorney that he be tried separately from his co-defendants. Burner thinks the jury viewed the evidence collectively against all four, as opposed to each individually.


  The jury found Burner and his co-defendants guilty of first-degree murder and related charges.


  “The only thing at the time in my mind was I didn’t do anything. I don’t know anything,” he said. “This was unfamiliar territory for me. I was being naive now, looking back, I know. But, unfortunately, I was a believer in the truth would set you free.”


  Decades later, over prosecutors’ objection, a judge in 2018 ordered Burner released from prison as part of the District’s Incarceration Reduction Amendment Act (IRAA). The 2016 law allows for early release of inmates who were juveniles at the time of their crimes, spent at least 20 years behind bars and have shown evidence of reform while incarcerated.


  Of the 52 former inmates released since the law was enacted, Burner is the only one who maintained his innocence, according to the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth.


  Back in the community, Burner kept focusing on his case and petitioned the court to declare him innocent.


  Two of his co-defendants, Harrod and McCoy, submitted statements from prison. Both men said Burner was not with them when they killed Wilson.


  Two childhood friends told the court they were with Burner playing dice when the killing occurred.


  Perhaps most important, Payton, the government’s supposed eyewitness against Burner, submitted a sworn statement in which he admitted that his testimony had been fabricated and that he was not at the scene of the shooting.


  Payton admitted that his account was pieced together from details he heard in the neighborhood and what the federal prosecutor shared with him during his questioning.


  Payton also admitted to implicating Burner because Burner had refused to give him a false alibi after an earlier arrest.


  “I thought it would make for better testimony and help me more in my own murder case. I knew that the prosecutor was going to go directly to the judge after trial and tell him that I had cooperated, so I told the prosecutor what I thought he wanted to hear. I also testified falsely against Troy because, at the time, I thought Troy could help me out in my case, but had refused to do so,” Payton said, according to court documents.


  Payton, who initially was charged with first-degree murder, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. He also was recently was released from prison.


  Holding anger toward Payton would be pointless, Burner says. “I realized long ago, I couldn’t waste any of my time being angry, being vindictive or giving any of that too much thought. I understand those emotions, if you allow them, will take control.”


  These days, Burner focuses on helping inmates. Last year, he graduated from Georgetown University’s Prison and Justice Initiative, a program for formerly incarcerated students. He also works with the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project on cases of prisoners who maintain they were wrongly convicted. And he works with the organization Changing Perceptions in helping other IRAA grantees adjust to life outside prison.


  Burner’s name has been added to the National Registry of Exonerations database, which includes more than 2,670 exoneration cases since 1989. The database is compiled by the Newkirk Center for Science & Society at the University of California at Irvine, the University of Michigan Law School and the Michigan State University College of Law.


  “My objective is to devote my time to the people that supported me and who were waiting for me. My mother, my brother, family and friends,” Burner said. “I have had a vast support system. A lot of them were very integral to my ability to persevere through these circumstances.”

Neil Stimson, aged 44, from Robert Hunt Gardens in Sandy, was found guilty and sentenced at St Albans Crown Court on Thursday, September 24, following an eight-day trial.


  He was handed a seven and a half year sentence.


  At around 6.20pm on Wednesday, April 22, a stolen Ford Fiesta was spotted by police travelling on the A505, heading towards Junction 9 of the A1(M) for Letchworth.


  Officers began to pursue the vehicle, which then headed on to the wrong side of the motorway, travelling north on the southbound carriageway.


  The pursuit was abandoned as a result.


  The Fiesta then left the motorway at Junction 10 for Baldock services, where police re-engaged and attempted to tactically stop the vehicle.


  It failed to stop and once again began travelling against the flow of traffic, resulting in a head-on collision with a van on the roundabout near Baldock services.


  Two occupants were found inside the Fiesta, Stimson in the driving seat and a 47-year-old woman in the passenger seat, who sustained serious injuries as a result of the collision. The van driver sustained minor injuries.

 The official rainfall season in the country starts from June 1 to September 30.
 This year, the monsoon made an onset over Kerala on June 1, its normal onset date. It covered the entire country on June 26, nearly a fortnight more than its normal schedule.
 According to the revised date, the new normal date for the monsoon to cover the entire country is July 8. The earlier normal date for the monsoon to cover the entire country was July 15.
 The monsoon has also withdrawn late this year. The new normal withdrawal date for the monsoon to retreat from west Rajasthan is September 17, while the earlier normal date for the monsoon to withdraw from west Rajasthan was July 15.
 While the monsoon was retreating from parts of north India, other parts of the country will continue to receive rainfall.
 A trough runs from a cyclonic circulation over east Bihar to west-central Bay of Bengal, off Andhra Pradesh coast across Gangetic West Bengal and coastal Odisha.
 Under the influence of this system, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with moderate thunderstorm and lightning are very likely over south peninsular India during the next three days, the weatherman said.
 Isolated heavy rainfall is very likely over Tamil Nadu during the next two days, the IMD added.
 According to the weather department, monsoon is set to end on an above-normal note. Until September 27, the country had received 9% more rainfall than the normal.
 Rainfall in the range of 96-104% of the Long Period Average (LPA) is considered as ‘normal’; 104-106% of the LPA as ‘above normal’ Anything beyond 110% is considered as ‘excess’

 But whether Delta Goodrem or Guy Sebastian will follow _The Voice_ to new home on Seven is another story itself.
 According to _Woman 's Day_, it looks like it's going to be a battle between Ricki-Lee Coulter and Delta for one spot on the panel.
 "She (Delta) no doubt wants to be at the helm of the show - she's very passionate about it - but Ricki is in a good spot to replace someone like her," says the insider.

For another, IT professionals tend to be more introverted than extroverted.

And, as a rule, when introverts need to recharge they prefer to do it alone. They will not miss being around others as much as extroverts who tend to recharge in groups. The biggest challenge for introverts may be surviving extended periods of confinement with roommates or family.

Thousands in Madrid have marched in protest against local lockdowns targeting mainly low-income areas in an effort to stem one of Europe's biggest surges in coronavirus cases in recent weeks.


  For a second straight week, demonstrators took to city streets on Sunday, criticising the conservative regional government's measures as discriminatory segregation and demanding more money for the health sector and an improvement in how infections are tracked.


  Left-wing parties, trade unions, citizens' initiatives and student associations had called for protests in various districts and municipalities in the greater area of the Spanish capital and demanded the resignation of regional president, Isabel Diaz Ayuso.


  "These measures only serve to punish and stigmatise the working class neighbourhoods in the south," said Carolina Alonso, a local MP from the left- wing Unidas Podemos party.


  On Friday, Diaz Ayuso ignored advice from the left-wing central government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to cordon off as much of Madrid as possible.


  Instead, she only ordered the expansion of existing restrictions on freedom of movement from 37 to 45 areas starting Monday.


  The central government is meanwhile considering largely sealing off the capital, even against the will of the regional government, according to local media reports.


  For the time being there has been no official confirmation of these plans.


  However Sanchez's Minister of Health, Salvador Illa, wrote on Twitter on Sunday that Madrid had been urged to "review" its measures and follow the recommendations of scientists and physicians.


  Against the backdrop of social and political unrest during the pandemic, the latest official figures on the infection rate offered a small glimmer of hope for the 6.6 million or so inhabitants of the Madrid region.


  The so-called seven-day incidence - the number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the past seven days, which for days was well over 300 in the area - has fallen to 267, according to the latest official figures.


  For the whole of Spain, however, the figure was less than half that at 121.

The Sydney Roosters insist their shot at an NRL three-peat is not in tatters after Friday night's humiliation and maintain they have the experience to bounce back.


  Their 60-8 flogging from South Sydney was their biggest at the hands of their arch-rivals, coming at the worst possible time on the eve of the finals.


  They also remain uncertain on the fitness of Jake Friend, who suffered a suspected fractured cheekbone following an early head clash in the heavy loss.


  Friend was expected to undergo scans on Saturday, but the results have not been confirmed.


  If Friend is out, the Roosters would lrely on Freddy Lussick or Lachlan Lam at dummy-half with Sam Verrills and Victor Radley already out for the rest of the season.


  Regardless, Friday's heavy loss has left them having to face minor premiers Penrith - who have not suffered a defeat since June - in the opening week of the finals.


  Veteran forward Jared Waerea-Hargreaves admitted the whole night was a slap in the face.


  But while such a pounding a week out from the finals would be the end of most teams, Waerea-Hargreaves had no such concerns given their history of performing in September.


  "No doubt we know how to handle this situation," Waerea-Hargreaves said.


  "We will marinate in all this hurt and frustration.


  "It was a bit of a slap in the face to be honest ... we got what we deserved in all aspects of the game.


  "But the belief is still very strong.


  "We've all played together for so long now with each other. It hurts. We bite the bullet and we get on with next week."


  The loss has left the Roosters needing to defy history to win the grand final, with no team having lifted the premiership trophy after conceding 50 points in a match.


  However they do carry a significant advantage come finals.


  They have the most finals experience of any top-eight team with 192 games between their fit squad, more than double that of Penrith's tally of 76.


  All leaving them well placed to be cool under pressure.


  "We just spoke (at the end of the match) about what we need to do and how we need to communicate and stay united and little things like that," Waerea- Hargreaves said.


  "We will let it simmer over the next couple of days and then we'll get onto prepping for next week."

The Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and its armed faction, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), who fought alongside other armed groups to overthrow the DERG, did not disarm after the forming of EPRDF in 1991 – the ruling coalition of parties representing different nations and nationalities. The formation of EPRDF was, on paper, supposed to mark Ethiopia’s transition from imperial and dictatorial rulers, to the path of democratic, pluralistic rule. The OLF did not disarm because the major influencer over this coalition, the TPLF, had no interest in leaving Oromia to be genuinely governed by its people and soon after the TPLF assumed power, Oromos, both OLF affiliated and not, were heralded into prisons.

N Tirupathi Kannan is already in 2022 when he speaks to us over call from Srivilliputhur. “Calendars are ready for printing at least six months in advance, so the lockdown has not really affected my workload. I’m nearly done with the orders for 2022,” says the 52-year-old illustrator who also works full-time as an art teacher in a government school in Srivilliputhur.
 Born in 1968 as the youngest of eight children, Kannan was always interested in drawing, but unable to afford the fees for art courses.
 “I worked as a salesman in a textile showroom and bookstall to make ends meet after finishing school,” he says. A kindly teacher, Mr Adinarayanan, saw him drawing in the bookstore and advised him to get trained so that he could attempt the Tamil Nadu Government’s certificate course for art. “He introduced me to drawing master Mr Karuppaiah, and I started weekly lessons. But it was difficult to balance my job with the classes, so I would end up drawing late into the night on the street after finishing my shift at the bookstore,” says Kannan.
 He moved on as a painter of steel cupboards and signboards, all the while working on his art training. He developed an interest in devotional images when apprenticing under a professional artist who used to take him along for mural painting assignments in temples.
 The turning point came when he was commissioned to illustrate work on an illustration of Lord Vinayaga for a magazine brought out by the administrators of Merku Mugha Valampuri Vinayagar Kovil, Srivilliputhur. “Photographs of the deity were too dark, so the printer wanted a hand-drawn picture for the cover,” says Kannan. “After this project, I realised that this is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.”
 After passing his art certificate course and securing an appointment as a teacher in Srivilliputhur, Kannan decided to devote after-school hours to calendar art. “Once I started painting, there was no looking back. I have been commissioned works by Tirupati Devasthanam, and temples in Malaysia ,” he says.
 He feels calendar artists like him have managed to survive the march of technology in art, because their skill cannot be replicated by a machine. “A computer will only be able to manipulate already extant images. Many publishers feel that hand-drawn illustrations are more lifelike than computer- generated images, especially when it comes to religious subjects,” he says.
 Kannan loves drawing religious images, because of its meditative quality. “Art is a vocation for me, and a way to connect with God. My pictures may be adorning many homes already, but I don’t think anyone would know the artist who draws these pictures. It gives meaning to all the struggles that I have undergone,” he concludes.
 ## Different strokes
 It has been many years since CS Anandan picked up a brush or pencil, but his career has been defined by calendar art. “I painted my last hand-drawn illustration in 2002, after which I shifted to computer-aided drawing,” says Anandan, who went solo as an illustrator of religious imagery in Sivakasi in 1971, and today is known more for his computer skills.
 “Painters who specialise in divine or devotional themes are getting harder to find, so those who can be creative and artistic at the same time, are highly valued in calendar production,” says the 71-year-old. “At the peak of my career in the early 1980s, I had around nine assistants to help me with big projects. But around 1987, computerisation started making an impact on the printing field, especially in commercial jobs like calendar publishing. Earlier, parents themselves used to bring their children and ask us to train them to become artists, but from 1998, I have had no assistants, because this field is no longer considered worthy of employment,” Anandan says ruefully over the phone.
 Still attached to ‘God pictures’, Anandan helps to adjust hand-drawn work into computer frames, besides creating original illustrations. “My calendar pictures travel all over the country,” he says. “Many of my old customers are from places like Delhi, Varanasi, Patna and so on. They email their designs to me, and I polish it up for publishing. Earlier we were making films of the final product; now we just email the soft copy, and it is transferred onto their plates for publishing.”
 He is reluctant to teach young people these days, because he says they tend to favour a more cartoonish style of drawing. “I am an old-school artist, trained in creating realistic images based on the human anatomy. Young people don’t have the patience to learn an art that may not earn them a handsome pay in the long run,” says Anandan.
 After a gap of nearly 18 years, Anandan recently drew a series of 35 pictures on planks of fig wood for the ‘palaayam pooja’ of the Sri Karguvel Ayyanar Temple in Sivakasi. “I thought it would be difficult to draw after such a long break, but after the first two, the pictures simply composed themselves,” says Ananthan. “It was good to know that my hands hadn’t forgotten their old skill.”

YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) — Fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces has erupted again over the disputed separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the territory’s defense ministry said 16 soldiers and two civilians have been killed and more than 100 others wounded.


  Azerbaijan’s president, meanwhile, says his military has suffered losses, but gave no details.


  Armenia also claimed that four Azerbaijani helicopters were shot down and 33 Azerbaijani tanks and fighting vehicles were hit by artillery. Azerbaijan’s defense ministry rejected an earlier claim that two helicopters were shot down.


  The heavy fighting broke out in the morning in the region that lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since 1994 at the end of a separatist war.


  It was not immediately clear what sparked the fighting, the heaviest since clashes in July killed 16 people from both sides.


  Nagorno-Karabakh authorities reported that shelling hit the region’s capital of Stepanakert and the towns of Martakert and Martuni. Armenian Defense Ministry spokesman Artsrun Hovhannisyan also said Azerbaijani shelling hit within Armenian territory near the town of Vardenis.


  The territorial defense ministry said late Sunday that 18 people were killed, including a woman and her grandson and more than 100 wounded.


  Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev ordered martial law be imposed in some regions of the country and called for a curfew in major cities.


  In a televised address to the nation, Aliyev said that “there are losses among the Azerbaijani forces and the civilian population as a result of the Armenian bombardment,” but didn’t give further details. He also claimed that “many units of the enemy’s military equipment have been destroyed.”


  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov “is conducting intensive contacts in order to induce the parties to cease fire and start negotiations to stabilize the situation,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.


  Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, called on the sides to stop fighting. The long- unsuccessful negotiations for resolving the territory’s status has been conducted under OSCE auspices.


  Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian on Sunday said the country could reexamine whether to recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as independent. Such a move would likely obstruct further negotiations.


  Foreign Minister Javad Zarif of Iran, which borders both Azerbaijan and Armenia, said “We call for an immediate end to hostilities and urge dialogue to resolve differences. Our neighbors are our priority and we are ready to provide good offices to enable talks.”


  Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin condemned Armenia.


  “Armenia has violated the cease-fire by attacking civilian settlements ... the international community must immediately say stop to this dangerous provocation,” Kalin tweeted. Turkey is a close ally of Azerbaijan and locked in a long dispute with Armenia that has closed the countries’ border since the early 1990s.

Obviously, allowing any offense to start that far up the field is a recipe for disaster, but the Hastings defense didn’t help its own cause very often. HC did have a defensive stand in a, at the time, pivotal moment in the game, but Doane still averaged 8.3 yards per carry on Saturday.
 “We were pressing. We were pressing half the time, and the other half we were just thinking Doane would lay down. We did not have a good week of practice for the second week in a row,” Harper said.
 Doane went into halftime with a 21-14 lead, but Hastings College tied the game on its first possession of the second half. The tide looked like it was beginning to turn when Hastings had the Tigers facing a third-and-2 on the ensuing possession. But Doane running back Jamaine Derogene busted a run up the middle 67 yards for a touchdown.
 On the following kickoff, the Tigers pounced on a fumble and took over at the Broncos’ 28. They went for the home run on the first play, with quarterback Adam Wasserman connecting with Kaden Reimers on an impressive throw and catch for the touchdown and a 35-21 lead.

While the jet fighters are the most glamorous and visible, aircraft carriers also operate squadrons of helicopters that play a huge role in anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and surveillance.

The Liberal National Party has pledged $440 million towards a $33 billion upgrade to almost 1500km of Queensland's major coastal highway.
 Opposition Leader Deb Frecklington has promised to immediately launch a $50 million study on widening the Bruce Highway into a four-lane road between Curra, north of Gympie, and Cairns if she's elected premier on October 31.
 The LNP estimates a full highway upgrade will take 15 years and cost $33 billion, 80 per cent of which they want the federal government to fund.
 "The LNP will build a faster, safer and more resilient Bruce Highway," Ms Frecklington said on Sunday.
 "Our plan for the Bruce is bold and ambitious, but I believe Queensland must start building for the future.
 "That's why the LNP's economic plan also includes the New Bradfield Scheme, as well as five new regional dam projects.
 "Only the LNP has a plan to get Queensland working again."
 When asked if the state's $440 million share of the funding would be taken from existing government programs and projects, the opposition leader said, "Not at all".
 Deputy Opposition Leader Tim Mander said unlike Labor, the LNP would be able to work with the Morrison government to secure funding.
 "We will lock that deal in," he said.
 The LNP leader said long stretches of the road are slow, dangerous and prone to flooding and improving the highway will boost productivity.
 She promised that regional companies will be prioritised during the tender process and tenders will be scaled to allow local small and medium-sized businesses to bid.
 The LNP estimates construction work would create an estimated 6820 full-time jobs per year.
 Ms Frecklington also said there would be a uniform speed limit of 110km/h along the whole length, which would dramatically cut travel times.
 The Bruce Highway runs through Mackay, Proserpine, Bowen Rockhampton, Townsville and Cairns, which are key electoral battlegrounds between Labor, the LNP and One Nation.
 Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk called the announcement "pie in the sky stuff" from the LNP.
 The premier claimed that Campbell Newman's previous LNP government had only built a single infrastructure project - a new government office block at 1 William Street in Brisbane.
 "They built a tower for themselves, they didn't care about Queensland, they didn't care about regional Queensland," she said.
 Queenslanders go to the polls on October 31.

While the front runners were having the run of things, it was Phil Ball and Abel Mudimu who had command of the central midfield. It was not long before goal number three came along when a foul committed by a frustrated home side defender led to a well taken free kick from Price 22 yards out finding the top corner of the net. This gave the striker a hat trick, while The 61 keeper watched on with the rest of the spectators.


  The Cod were by no means finished, their assault on the home side’s defence saw the visitors flying wingers cut across the full backs for Gutzmore to tuck the ball under the keeper to make it goal number four, shortly followed by a similar move with Bennet slotting home the fifth.


  Bennett’s pace continued to trouble the home side, when in the 87th minute a well-timed run led to a foul inside the box giving the ref no option but to point to the spot.


  Up stepped Louis Wylie to tuck the ball into the bottom left hand corner, making goal number six.

LONDON (AP) — Every empty seat in a Premier League stadium represents a visual reminder of the financial struggle many soccer teams are facing amid the coronavirus pandemic. For the smaller teams, those without TV contracts and huge fan bases, those empty seats can be devastating. “We're in a tough place,” Hanwell Town commercial manager Nigel Hunt said of the impact on his semi-pro club in west London. “Ticket receipts and sales of food and drinks at halftime are a crucial element of our income.” A report released Monday says 10% of grassroots soccer clubs in Britain face closure because of the financial effects of the pandemic. According to the “State of Play” report, the smallest clubs in the country have lost an average of 46% of their income. The economic fallout has also hurt families, with 20% of parents surveyed saying they can't afford to send their child back to their club. In May during an an online panel discussion hosted by the International Centre for Sports Studies at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland, Lokomotiva Zagreb director Dennis Gudasic said “the biggest threat to club football in the coming six months is going to be the survival of smaller clubs.” Although the Premier League and other professional leagues in England completed their seasons despite the ongoing restrictions related to the pandemic, Hanwell Town’s final games in the 2019-20 season were canceled. That decision not only stopped the games, it also stopped the income. “The COVID crisis hit just as gate receipts were increasing,” Hunt said. “We were top of the league and in the running for promotion when lockdown hit.” Some clubs have been much more fortunate, however. Chertsey Town, for instance, won the FA Vase trophy in 2019 — a national cup...

Nathan Cleary's Dally M hopes have been handed a massive boost with the Penrith halfback not set to lose six points for an early season two-game NRL ban.


  It had initially been thought Cleary would lose three points for each of the two matches he missed when banned for misleading the integrity unit over a quarantine breach.


  However, the NRL has now confirmed that won't be the case with points deductions only relating to on-field matters of foul play.


  "Consistent with previous seasons, players will only be deducted Dally M points for on-field suspensions handed down by the match review committee or judiciary," an NRL spokesman said.


  Cleary would arguably have been the favourite to claim the award even with the six-point deduction factored in.


  He was equal-fourth when voting went behind closed doors, but only two points off leader Harry Grant.


  Cleary has not missed a game since then, with four of the five players either level or ahead of him having sat at least one in that time.


  The Panthers No.7 has been in dominant form this year as his side remains undefeated since round six - with Cleary leading the NRL for try involvements, kick metres and 40-20s.


  The NRL's Dally Ms will be held in grand final week, with a virtual component likely as the NRL consider whether players will be able to attend either in or out of bubbles.

Yes, I completely understand the fact that all of these requirements can be easily met, but my issue lies with them following the rising and popular notion that everything negative in history must be removed and forgotten or changed. I do not approve of this way of thinking because, for starters, the whole reason why we study history is to prevent bad things from repeating itself. Yet when we begin to strip away history, it reminds me of an event I learned about during my time spent in Berlin, Germany.

One of the defining features of the initial reforms that swept Ethiopia when Abiy Ahmed was appointed to lead a transitory government towards an election, was the invitation to the OLF and its armed faction, the OLA, to disarm and join the political space as a genuine competitor, or to join the country’s military. This saw many (not all) of those who had been fighting in the guerilla movement, disarm. There was no integration plan for these ex- combatants and it is widely believed that many soldiers of varying rank were poisoned and killed during the first weeks of return. In light of the intensification of abuse that the Oromo have experienced under the Abiy government, the number of those taking up arms as part of continued guerilla action has increased exponentially.

In the face of a momentous election, with an array of issues that includes the pandemic, the recession, climate change, racial justice, law enforcement and the next appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, the chairman of the Texas GOP and a gang of lawmakers and activists have instead picked a fight with Abbott, who isn’t even on the ballot, over his response to the pandemic.


  On the surface, they’re asking the courts to tell the governor that adding six more days of early voting to the calendar was outside of his powers. Abbott made the move under emergency powers he has claimed during the pandemic — the same powers he has used at various times to shut down schools, limit crowd sizes and limit how many customers businesses can serve at a time, or in some cases, to close businesses altogether.


  The timing is connected to the Nov. 3 general election; even with the arguments over emergency powers, opponents of the governor’s action would be expected to grab for a remedy before early voting starts on Oct. 13. One might say the same about other lawsuits challenging the governor’s orders — that they’re tied not to politics, but to current events. Bar owners want to open their bars, for instance, and are not in the financial condition or the mood to stay closed until after the elections just to make the current set of incumbents look good.


  What’s unusual is to see so many prominent Republican names on the top of a lawsuit against the Republican governor of Texas this close to an election.


  In a gentler time, that might be called unseemly or distracting. Speaking ill of another Republican was considered out of bounds for a while there. Those days are over. What’s happening in Texas illustrates how the pandemic, the economy and other issues have shaken political norms.


  Shelley Luther is one of six people running in a special election to replace state Sen. Pat Fallon, a Prosper Republican who gave up his statehouse perch for a shot at a congressional seat. Abbott doesn’t have a hand in the race, but his name is being invoked. Luther is the Dallas-area salon owner who was briefly jailed this year after defying Abbott’s orders closing businesses like hers that were officially deemed “nonessential.” So maybe it’s not a surprise that she campaigns as a candidate who’s independent of her party leader.


  She started the game playing the renegade card and has stuck with it. But she’s not alone out there. Some of the state’s most conservative Republicans — part of Abbott’s base of support over his decades in state government — are taking the governor to task. State Rep. Steve Toth, R-The Woodlands, has disowned Abbott, saying he can no longer follow the GOP’s leading state official.


  “What started as 15 days to flatten the curve has turned into six months of misery to the small business owners of House District 15,” Toth wrote in a letter to Abbott that he later posted on social media. He said Abbott had demonstrated an “appalling lack of consistency, leadership, and concern” for small businesses.


  That’s the kind of chippy note from one politician to another that you’d expect to read in the last few weeks before a big election. But this election has no direct bearing on either of these politicians.


  Toth is running as a Republican in a House district where Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 37.2 percentage points and where Ted Cruz beat Beto O’Rourke by 29.8 percentage points. It’s safe to say he’s safe in the general election, unless he steps into an open manhole crossing the street. Abbott, elected to a second term in 2018, isn’t on the ballot this year.


  The election is near. Unless the courts change it, early voting starts in less than three weeks. Democrats and Republicans are shouting at each other, as the season demands. In a normal presidential election year, a Texas governor who isn’t on the ballot would be leading the partisan charge, helping lesser and greater figures rally their voters in the state.


  Abbott isn’t ignoring the political fights of the season. But there is an extra one this year — in his own political family.

It's time to be judicious since the idea of who the better actor is when it comes to talking about Dave Bautista and Dwayne Johnson is a topic that many people would want to weigh in on since some folks would pick one or the other. Personally, I would state that Dwayne Johnson often plays the same character in different situations, but he changes just enough to make each role fit the movie he's in. Bautista feels like his career is still building, but thanks to his turn as Drax the Destroyer he managed to get a huge leg up, and his role in Blade Runner 2049, despite being incredibly short, was noticed by a lot of people and thought to be incredible. To be certain, each man has come a long way since their time in the WWE, and to hear Bautista throwing shade at Johnson is kind of funny really since if anyone remembers, and most people do, Johnson had kind of a rocky start, no pun intended I swear. His turn as the Scorpion King was great and awful in The Mummy Return since the CGI version was just terrible, while his turn in a solo movie wasn't quite what a lot of fans were hoping for since it turned corny at one point. But wouldn't you know it, the guy that didn't think Dwayne Johnson was a good actor actually starred in another installment of the same movie that helped Johnson become a big star. That's a heap of sour grapes coming from Bautista really since his own career has taken a while to get going as well, even though he started out on TV at one point and was seen in an episode of Smallville. It's possible that it's time for Bautista to really look at Dwayne's career and see where he's been and what he's done and why he's a better actor than that.

To address such issues, computer scientists have increasingly turned to more sophisticated approaches that take humans out of the loop entirely. They are using machine learning algorithms that teach a computer program to recognize patterns, such as meaningful relationships between words. For example, the computer can learn that pairs of words such as “bank” and “river” often occur together. These associations can give clues to meaning or to sentiment. If “bank” and “money” are in the same sentence, it is probably a different kind of bank.

Fuente said Hooker has not practiced in some time because of health concerns unrelated to COVID-19. But ensuing tests have been positive, and Fuente expects Hooker “back up and running” this upcoming week.
 With attendance limited to 1,000 by the pandemic, Saturday’s ambiance was as peculiar as you’d imagine.
 The weirdness began with the unimpeded drive down Interstate 81 to Exit 118-B and onto campus. Stadium parking lots were essentially barren, even with the venue’s lights aglow, signaling the Hokies were poised to kick off.
 Silence rather than the social buzz of tailgating was the prevailing sound as we strolled toward the press tower. Why, even Frank Beamer’s statue outside the stadium was lonely, absent the standard throngs posing alongside for selfies.

The play that set up New England's sack-fumble-touchdown was an illegal block above the waist on a kickoff return by Devontae Booker, which put the Raiders at their own 6-yard line. Daniel Carlson missed a 41-yard field goal attempt that would have tied the game 13-13 early in the third quarter. He also converted from 29 and 25 yards. Other than that, the Raiders did little to impact the game on special teams nor did they do anything else egregious.

Melbourne will sweat on Tui Kamikamica and Max King's finals availability after two of the five regulars they ran out against St George Illawarra fell into trouble.


  King faces a nervous wait to see if he is charged by the NRL's match review committee on Monday for a hip-drop tackle in the 30-22 loss.


  The tackle drew anger from commentators amid claims there was intent to injure, prompting a staunch rebuttal from Storm coach Craig Bellamy.


  With 12 of their first-choice players rested and sitting back in camp on the Sunshine Coast, Kamikamica then also suffered a double whammy.


  The forward could also be looked at for a shoulder charge on Dragons debutant Jayden Sullivan after the playmaker had passed the ball.


  He then left the field with an ankle injury, with Bellamy fearing that could rule him out of Saturday night's qualifying final against Parramatta.


  "I'm not quite sure how bad yet, but there is certainly concern for next week no doubt," Bellamy said.


  "Obviously getting Tui injured tonight won't help us. But most clubs have a few guys that are injured.


  "For us usually it's not ideal for so many guys to miss the last round together, but we just thought it was the best option for us."


  On paper, Saturday's match up at Suncorp Stadium suits the Storm with a ticket to straight to the preliminary final at stake.


  Parramatta have not beaten the Storm when they have been anywhere close to full strength since 2012.


  Their 18-0 defeat of Melbourne in round 15 came while the Storm were without Cameron Smith and Cameron Munster.


  They also had victories over them in 2015 and 2017, but they both came in the week before State of Origin games.


  But regardless, this Eels team appear a far different one to years gone by, having sat in the top four since the end of round two.


  "We played Parramatta about four weeks ago and they beat us quite convincingly.


  "They were one of the real hot teams early in the season after we came back from the break. Them and the Roosters, Penrith have been up there all year.


  "We know it's going to be a tough game next week, it's a final. All the finals are going to be tough."

At least two Democratic senators refuse to meet with Barrett but won’t boycott the hearings. “I will refuse to treat this process as legitimate & will not meet with Judge Amy Coney Barrett,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said in a tweet. Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono has taken the same position.
 Among the tools Democrats might use to delay Barrett’s confirmation are refusing to allow the Senate to go into recess at the end of the day, or repeatedly calling for quorum calls which would force Republican senators to be physically present during the run-up to the election.
 If Barrett is confirmed, Democrats might try to expand the size of the Supreme Court. That would only be possible, however, if Joe Biden wins the presidential election and Democrats win control of the Senate. Several key cases, including a challenge to Obamacare, could already be decided by then.

  “This focus on planning has served him well at AWC,” the college said. “Building a culture of project planning and management is a passion of his.”


  Walker began developing his infrastructural background in the early days of his career, when he worked as a programmer and, later, a network engineer. After earning his master’s degree in business administration, Walker also completed postgraduate work in technology management in addition to a stint as a chief information officer, according to AWC.


  The product of an Air Force family, Walker has hung his hat across the globe, having spent a few years in Japan, Korea and Wake Island. Walker is also an “aviation aficionado,” a pilot and the 12-year owner of a small aviation company.


  “As soon as I leave the ground, my cares fall away,” he said. “Did you know you can buy an airplane for less than a car?”


  According to the college, similarly to flying, planning technology for a college district of 11,000 students is “all about perspective.”

We may find ourselves asking (and the U.S. has already asked this), do we then need these organisations? On the level of health, do we need the World Health Organisation to coordinate a SARS-CoV-2 response globally (which it doesn’t seem to have the authority to do, but may in the future)? The United States, for instance, doesn’t seem to think so, after making the decision to defund the W.H.O. All these questions sit in a distinctly global framework.

 "We still want to see our test results get a little bit higher," she told reporters on Monday.
 "If anybody has got any symptoms, can you please go and get tested."
 The state has eight active coronavirus cases, with 1157 since the crisis started.
 Ms Palaszczuk said the overnight case result should give "Queenslanders the confidence to get out and about and do things".
 It comes as one coronavirus case was diagnosed in a returned overseas traveller on Sunday, who is in mandatory hotel quarantine.
 Three new cases were detected on Saturday, also among overseas arrivals, who were in quarantine.
 It has been almost three weeks since an infection caused by community transmission.

A Victorian plumber who left another man wheelchair-bound after passing out from drug-induced fatigue while driving a truck has been jailed.
 Benjamin Black's truck was carrying a load of more than 19 tonnes when he blacked out, ran a red light and collided with six vehicles in December 2017.
 Black, 33, injured seven people and returned a positive result for methylamphetamine following the crash at Sydney Road, Fawkner in Melbourne's north.
 Michael Yates, a 32-year-old bricklayer who was returning from work, suffered "catastrophic" injuries, Judge Kevin Doyle told the Victorian County Court on Monday.
 Mr Yates is now wheelchair bound, he said, as well as being dependent on daily care from his sister to help him eat, clean and groom himself.
 As Judge Doyle handed Black a total sentence of two years and four months in prison, he said Mr Yates had been "irreparably damaged" by the injuries and that he, as well as his mother and sister, would never be the same.
 He said there was no medical cause for the driver's blackout.
 Instead, the judge accepted it was likely triggered by rebound fatigue from drugs he had consumed several days before getting behind the wheel.
 "To fall asleep at the wheel of a truck during peak hour involves the near inevitability of serious injury," Judge Doyle told the court on Monday.
 "This is not a case of momentary inattention - your driving with those drugs in your system was the cause of the collision."
 Black, who pleaded guilty and was convicted of two counts of dangerous driving causing serious injury, will be eligible for parole after one year and two months.

Run through the champions of the 2000s and you'll see nothing but title winners littered with stars. Starting with the early 2000 Lakers to the Spurs teams with multiple Hall of Famers on them to the Big Three in Miami to the NBA's most recent dynasty in the Bay Area. You win with stars and the more you have the better your odds.


  Sure, there are exceptions to the rule. But those exceptions featured legendary players putting on legendary performances. The Dirk Nowitzki-led Mavericks in 2011 and the Kawhi Leonard-led Raptors last year are two exceptions since those future Hall of Famers didn't have running mates anywhere near their level. The 2004 Pistons championship squad full of grizzled veterans that only featured one All-Star that season (Ben Wallace), is the only real outlier.


  Detroit's upset of Los Angeles was significant--the Pistons were the biggest underdog to win the Finals in almost 50 years and the Heat, installed with +350 odds to beat the Lakers, would be the second biggest underdog champs in modern NBA history. Detroit beat a disjointed Lakers squad that featured Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant who were ready to be done with each other after years of butting heads. Sixteen years later, the Lakers' new dynamic duo of AD and LeBron have been a lethal combo (Nos. 3 and 4, respectively, in Net Rating in the playoffs) and their chemistry is off the charts. Beating two superstars that are practically impossible to contain, relatively healthy, and like playing with each other over a seven-game series feels like a monumental task for Miami.


  But it's not impossible There are obvious reasons why the Heat will be a live underdog in the Finals and could pull off the upset. For starters, they're on a bit of a magical run in Orlando, and sometimes in sports that kind of cosmic momentum is too great to fuck up. Displaying the kind of team chemistry the Clippers could only dream about, the Heat genuinely like each other, have avoided any kind of drama, and shown zero desire to duck out of bubble life early unlike some other squads.

Ultimately it was a falling out with Stuart midway through the 2019 season that sealed Leilua's fate and saw him move to the Tigers this year, as well as the fact the Raiders had signed Curtis Scott. Though injuries cruelled his final year in the nation's capital, Leilua didn't fit the culture Stuart is trying to build at the Raiders. It's evident in how his first year in Tigers colours under Michael Maguire has unfolded.

Even today, when asked to explain their support for Trump, voters often point to his success in business as evidence of his acumen.

FALL RIVER -- With the eye on the ball to redevelop the city's waterfront, the Fall River Redevelopment Authority has entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Liberty Utilities to purchase two acres of property at 45 Anawan St.


  "One of the functions of the RDA is the urban renewal plan and the waterfront renewal plan and this property falls within the scope of the waterfront plan. And when this opportunity came up it was a natural and that's what we are supposed to be looking for," said RDA Chairman Joseph Marshall.


  The proximity of the land was also attractive being across from the State Pier and next door to the Gates of the City.


  With a sale price of $698,500, the RDA has 60 days to do appropriate testing for land that is likely contaminated.


  "We're not sure of the direction we are going but we are going to be doing a lot of testing to see just what we can put on it," said Marshall. "It could end up being a parking lot because the city needs parking there. If it turns out its contaminated and all we can do is put a cap on it, then that's what we'll do."


  The parcel is identified in the RDA's Waterfront Renewal Plan and is currently used by Liberty Utilities.


  In May, the utility company purchased the former Homeland Builders property on Sykes Road in the Industrial Park for $5.8 million with a plan to make the 72,280-square-foot facility as its home base.


  Mayor Paul Coogan has said publicly that he supports the purchase of the land for future public use.


  Future development of the Anawan Street property would be an addition to the RDA's waterfront redevelopment initiative with an ongoing project to restore the four-acre City Pier into a public way.


  Last month the Seaport Economic Council awarded a $1 million grant to help redevelop the City Pier to add to RDA's pledge to invest another $1.6 million.


  Marshall said work will likely begin in the spring to cap the pier and add walkways, fencing and lighting at the site.

"Of course, Trump has repeatedly faced — and survived — devastating turns that would have sunk any other politician," Jill Colvin notes at _The Associated Press_. But the news he "paid just $750 in federal income taxes the year he ran for office and paid no income taxes at all in many others threaten to undercut a pillar of his appeal among blue-collar voters," because "even today, when asked to explain their support for Trump, voters often point to his success in business as evidence of his acumen." _Peter Weber_

Spartacus the pet cat had a visit from a relative Thursday, but didn't seem to notice the big bobcat sitting by the rock in his yard.


  Spartacus's owner, Maria Croft, was working at her desk when she looked out the window and saw the wild animal in her Apponaug backyard.


  "I was stunned," she said. "At first I was thinking, 'What's that?' It was absolutely beautiful. It just sat there peacefully. It didn't look out of sorts or out of place. It looked right at home."


  She called her husband, Steph, and it took them both a few seconds to realize they were looking at a bobcat. Then she remembered that Spartacus was sharing space with the bigger cat.


  She sent Steph out to retrieve the pet, which was only 20 to 30 feet away from the wild cat. The bobcat seemed to take notice, but remained stoic as Steph was bringing the pet inside, according to Croft.


  "It just turned and walked away," she says.


  Before the bobcat left, Croft snapped some photographs and posted them to Facebook. She estimates the bobcat spent five to 10 minutes in her yard.


  Like Croft, many of her neighbors were in "awe" when they saw the photos, although some expressed trepidation. Croft has seen wild animals like deer and coyotes in the neighborhood, but never a bobcat. "It's still pretty suburban," she says.


  The bobcat population in Rhode Island seems to be increasing, according to Amy Mayer, a research associate for the University of Rhode Island's Wildlife Genetics and Ecology Lab.


  The URI lab and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management are wrapping up a five-year study of bobcats, which included trapping and tagging the animals to monitor their movements and also observing them on trail cameras.


  It's difficult to estimate how many bobcats live in Rhode Island, according to Mayer, but she notes there have been confirmed sightings in most Rhode Island cities and towns, except for Block Island, Aquidneck Island, Providence and North Providence. Westerly and the South Kingstown village of Matunuck seem especially popular for sightings.


  Still, it's remarkable to spot one sitting in the backyard of your Warwick home in the middle of the afternoon.


  "Sightings are pretty few and far between because they are cryptic and don't really like to be around people," Mayer says.


  They're also more active at night, hunting their favorite food sources such as rabbits, squirrels, mice, and sometimes birds. ("Boy, do we have squirrels!" Croft says. "This place would be a buffet for the bobcat!")


  What about pet cats? Mayer says bobcats wouldn't typically hunt pet cats, but "with any wild animal, I always tell people to keep an eye on your pets."


  Large house cats are sometimes mistaken for their wild relatives. Mayer has been shown plenty of photos of house cats from people who were convinced they'd spotted a bobcat. One sure way to tell them apart is the bobbed tail of the bobcat, according to Mayer. Bobcats are tall and leggy and weigh a maximum of 30 pounds, she says.


  "People are often surprised how big they appear, even though they are not that heavy," Mayer says.


  Croft describes her visitor as being "taller than a beagle but smaller than a lab."


  Might the bobcat return to visit the Crofts and Spartacus?


  "They move a ton," Mayer says. "Their range spans the entire width of the state."


  But who really knows?


  "They're cats," Mayer says. "They do what they want to do."

Dialogue becomes an option in a context like Ethiopia when the playing field is equalized. In a country that deploys military capacity like it were hot air balloons, the only way to equalize this playing field and put an end to the daily killings and arrests across Oromia at the hands of military, is to militarize right back, against the state. Emphasis: not its civilian population, but the state itself. We may begin to understand the Oromo’s right to an armed movement from the vantage point of self-defence – but we can go on to define the grounds of this nation’s right to further activate a fully- fledged armed movement to achieve its liberation from Ethiopia completely.
