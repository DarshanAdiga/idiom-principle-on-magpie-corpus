WEST MILFORD — Although he wasn’t able to play out his final prep year, South Harrison senior Hunter Lipps notched an impressive milestone last month when he signed to play collegiately at Bethany College.


  Bethany, which competes in the Eastern College Athletic Conference at the Division 3 level, checked all the boxes.


  “It’s just a really nice campus,” Lipps explained. “Their coach sent me a video of their campus, and it looked very nice. I have been in close contact with all of the coaches, and (Bethany had coach Justin Thomas) seems like a really cool guy. He’s very supportive of everything I have been doing on and off the field, and (Thomas) has talked a lot about their atmosphere.

I'm pleasantly surprised by both the performance AND the last-minute drop in price. Personally I don't like blower style cards and will be on the lookout for third-party offerings with more traditional dual fan coolers. This is totally personal preference as I tend to build in bigger cases with plenty of ventilation to deal with the extra heat. If the prices don't get too out of line from the AIBs then I'll gladly give a few of these cards a go in upcoming builds. I'm also expecting a decent improvement in thermals so hopefully these FE cards aren't exemplary of the best cooling you can get on air. The prospect of building all AMD machines in the coming months has got me totally nerding out.

Gurugram A woman and her juvenile daughter were arrested for allegedly murdering a 47-year-old man after a fight over overflowing water in Nathupur in DLF phase 3, the police said Wednesday. The police said the deceased man, Kishori Lal of Ghaziabad who had a garment shop in Nathupur, succumbed after he was injured while trying to settle an argument between his wife and their neighbours. The police said Lal's family and their neighbours share a terrace. According to the police, the incident took place around 6pm on Monday when Lal's wife, Saroj, was pouring water on the terrace, where she sleeps on a cot, for respite from the heat. A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that his neighbour Satbir was sitting on a cot on the terrace and cooking at the time of the incident. When Saroj was pouring water, some of it flowed underneath Satbir's cot, leading to an argument. "Satbir's wife and daughter objected to the overflowing water and an argument ensued. According to the complainant Saroj, Satbir's wife and daughter started assaulting her and her husband rushed to help her. In the alleged scuffle, he was kicked and beaten up," the police officer said. The police said Lal sustained a groin injury and fell unconscious. He was rushed to a private hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. The police have arrested the neighbour Sonia, who works as a housekeeper, and her 15-year-old daughter in the case. The police said the juvenile would be sent to an observation home in Karnal.A case was registered under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code at DLF phase 3 police station. In another incident, three men were arrested for allegedly murdering a 28-year-old daily wager after a drunken spat post a gambling session in Pataudi on Wednesday. The police said the victim, Bijender alias Badshah, was playing cards with Kuldeep alias Chikla, Satbir and Deepak on Tuesday evening. After Bijender won the game, the group started drinking liquor and while doing so, the victim got into a petty argument with the other men. One of the accused men, Deepak, hit him with a brick. The other two men also hit him with stones and bricks and fled. The police said his body was found near Major Market in Pataudi late Tuesday night. There were injuries on his face, suggesting that his head had been bludgeoned with a heavy object multiple times, the police said. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, "The trio was arrested from Pataudi on Wednesday. A case of murder has been registered."

Performance


  Is it worth it? Well the honest answer is yes it is. Liquid-coolers are far faster at moving heat away from the CPU than a traditional air tower. Additionally that heat is transferred to a radiator that typically sits on the very edges of your chassis, as opposed to air tower fins which sit in the center of your case. This moves heat away from the entire system (including the graphics card) reducing overall internal temperatures across the board.


  With modern day processors there’s also big advantages for stock performance, especially for the Ryzen 3000 series. PBO (Precision Boost Overdrive) monitors several metrics across the processor, then increases the duration of max clock speed across the cores dependent on the result. One of those variables is CPU temperature, and another is VRM temps, if you can keep heat away from both in a far more effective manner then stock performance will improve. Additionally for Intel, better cooling opens up higher overclocks.


  When it comes to liquid cooling your components a good rule thumb (whether that's with an AIO or a full custom-loop) is that you need a minimum of 120mm of radiator per part you wish to cool. With this 280mm rad, you’ve got 133% more than that for a single part, making it a far better solution overall.

There are a couple of things worth looking at here. First of all, the fact that the studio is spending _more than_ $ 30 million is revealing. The Justice League, as it stands, is said to have cost $ 300 million, given the extensive rewrites and re-recordings that Joss Whedon supervised before the theatrical release. Since the film grossed a relatively disappointing $ 657 million at the worldwide box office, the studio lost money. Any additional investment will make them even more red, and that's quite an investment.


   

  The other point here is that Greenblatt says Zack Snyder "doesn't exist." It is something that has been strongly emphasized and hinted at by those who worked on _League of Justice_ , but it is worth repeating. The mythical cut Zack Snyder selected for the executives was an assembly cut. It was not, by definition, a finished movie. It was never going to be as simple as Warner Bros. giving Snyder the green light to release his version. Extensive work needs to be done before the cut we've heard so much about can be considered releasable.


  Zack Snyder and his team are currently working hard to complete the extensive visual effects work necessary to prepare for the cut. The cast has also been contacted to do any additional voice-over work that may be necessary. However, it is reported that no further tinkering will be done, despite Snyder's desire to take some additional photography. We will make sure to keep you informed as more details become available.

VIRGINIA — The St. Louis County Board voted Tuesday to once again delay a decision on refugee resettlement and wait out litigation over President Donald Trump’s executive order empowering local governments to make decisions on the matter.


  Commissioners voted 4-3 on an amended motion that asked county administration to bring the refugee issue back to the board when it considers the issue relevant. Voting was divided by Duluth and rural commissioners with Chair Mike Jugovich of Chisholm, Keith Nelson of Virginia, Paul McDonald of Ely and Keith Musolf of rural Duluth voting in favor. Commissioners Frank Jewell, Paul McDonald and Beth Olson voted against.


  In making the motion to amend, Jugovich said refugees would still be allowed to settle in St. Louis County since a court blocked Trump’s order earlier this year. Nelson seconded the motion.


  “It doesn’t bother me because it doesn’t change anything in the interim,” the chair said.


  “In the end without a vote, I think it really sends the message that it's not a welcoming place,” Olson said.


  Commissioners heard three hours of testimony on the subject for the second time this year, as protestors in opposition to accepting refugees gathered outside the Virginia Government Service Center on Tuesday morning.


  Due to restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, public comment was limited to a call-in number, voicemail and written communication to the board. Protestors and residents seeking public comment were not allowed inside the building.


  Three commissioners — Jugovich, Nelson and Musolf — participated in person while Boyle, Jewell, Paul McDonald and Olson joined via video conferencing.


  The issue of refugee resettlement consent sprang up last winter, after Trump issued an executive order requiring counties to consent to resettlement. Notably, Beltrami County in Minnesota voted against giving its consent, becoming the first county in Minnesota and the second in the U.S. to reject resettlement. Many counties, including neighboring Carlton County, declined to take it up after a federal judge blocked the order, nullifying the need for boards to act.


  The most recent debate among St. Louis County commissioners centered on the issue of refugees being a symbolic vote in light of the judge’s order. Jewell said the board has taken several symbolic votes in the past and Tuesday’s vote would have significance later.


  “These are also real peoples’ lives,” he said comparing the vote to those the board took supporting copper-nickel mining. “It just proves the point of how worried we are about voting on it. This vote now will be just as important as when the administration or the courts make the final decision. We will have decided.”


  Nelson said he wasn’t supporting the motion because of the symbolic nature during the coronavirus pandemic.


  However, he noted that residents of his district did not support resettlement.


  “Voters overwhelmingly told me over the last several months that they don’t agree with this,” he said. “They simply do not.”


  The county’s handling of refugee resettlement stems back to Jan. 7 when the board listened to 40 people testify in Duluth for more than two hours before voting 4-3 to postpone a decision to accept or ban the resettlement of refugees until this month. Nelson made the motion to table the vote. Jugovich agreed.


  In January, after three hours of public comment in Duluth, residents largely favored consent. On Tuesday, some opposition cited the COVID-19 pandemic.


  Guy Holmes of Virginia was one of the callers against resettlement. He called the measure “ill placed” at this time, referring to the uncertainty surrounding a return to normal life amid the impacts of the coronavirus.


  “Nothing can operate normally,” he said over the phone to commissioners. “Businesses are looking at bankruptcy over [coronavirus]” and consenting to refugees “anytime in the near future is just unconscionable.”


  Jeff Forseen of Mountain Iron echoed that line of thinking when he called into the board later in the morning, saying the county doesn’t know where the local or national economy is headed.


  “I see economic devastation across this country, the financial ramifications of which we can’t even imagine because we’re not far enough into this thing,” he said. “Refugees should be way down the list.”


  Another caller, Beth Holt of Duluth, said the vote was largely symbolic since there was “little to no chance” a refugee would be settled in St. Louis County. Since 2011, only one refugee has relocated to the Northland.


  St. Louis County has resettled one refugee in the past six years and zero in the past five years, according to data from the Minnesota Department Human Services that shows Ramsey County has the largest number of resettlements in the same time frame at 4,215, followed by Hennepin, 1,345; Stearns, 662; Anoka, 430; and Olmsted, 377.


  “Does that mean we wouldn’t have 50 in the next three months? No, it doesn’t,” Nelson said later in the meeting Tuesday night. “We all know how the federal government works.”


  Holt questioned the board on why refugees would not resettle in the region, citing many of the callers Tuesday that confused refugees with “illegal immigrants” and other comments that might make refugees feel unaccepted and shunned when looking for a job or home.


  “Voting yes when we don’t have to is an opportunity one doesn’t often have,” Holt said, encouraging the board to consent. “Don’t be afraid to lead, commissioners, and make the right decision on this. You have all the facts.”


  Jugovich said misinformation was the biggest issue he encountered from those against resettlement and said educating people on refugees was one his failures since the January vote was tabled.


  He has been telling citizens that refugees are individuals who leave their home because of war and violence while immigrants are people who make a decision to leave their home and move to a foreign country. Both refugees and immigrants are vetted before entering the U.S. and in Minnesota.


  He said he heard of resettlements planned in Virginia and the former Buhl school being used as a resettlement option. He said Buhl is being considered by two organizations that have nothing to do with refugees.


  “That’s not the case,” he said. “That’s not factual.”

Parts of northern and western India reeled under scorching heat on Wednesday, with temperatures hovering near the 50 degree-mark in Rajasthan, while the IMD said no immediate respite is likely from the ongoing heatwave conditions.In the national capital, the mercury settled six notches above normal in most areas. Palam remained the hottest with a maximum temperature of 47.2 degrees Celsius, marginally less than Tuesday's 47.6 degrees Celsius.In large areas, a heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature is 45 degrees Celsius for two consecutive days and a severe heatwave is when the mercury touches 47 degrees Celsius for two days on the trot.In small areas, like the national capital, a heatwave is declared if the temperature soars to 45 degrees Celsius even for a day, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for Delhi, recorded a maximum temperature of 45.9 degrees Celsius.The last time the mercury touched the 46-degree mark at the Safdarjung weather station was on May 19, 2002, said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The all-time record for Safdarjung in May is 47.2 degrees Celsius. It was recorded on May 29, 1944.The IMD said the weather stations at Lodhi Road and Ayanagar recorded maximum temperatures of 45.1 degrees Celsius and 46.7 degrees Celsius, respectively.Severe heatwave conditions prevailed in Rajasthan. Churu was the hottest place in the state with a maximum temperature of 49.6 degrees Celsius, according to the meteorological (MeT) department.On Tuesday, Churu had recorded a high of 50 degrees Celsius -- the district's second-highest maximum temperature in the month of May in the last 10 years.Ganganagar, Bikaner and Kota recorded maximum temperatures of 48.9 degrees Celsius, 48 degrees Celsius and 47.2 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Wednesday.Jaisalmer recorded a high of 46.1 degrees Celsius, Barmer 45.9 degrees Celsius, Jaipur 44.8 degrees Celsius and Ajmer 44 degrees Celsius.The weather department said heatwave conditions will continue in the state for the next 24 hours.Neighbouring Haryana, too, reeled under blistering heat, with Narnaul recording the highest maximum temperature at 47.2 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.Hisar recorded a maximum temperature of 46.3 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal.Among other places in the state, Ambala sizzled at 43.8 degrees Celsius, while the mercury settled at 42.8 degrees Celsius in Karnal.Sweltering heat also swept Punjab, where Patiala recorded a high of 44.2 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal.Amritsar and Ludhiana also recorded above-normal temperatures of 43.5 degrees Celsius and 44.2 degrees Celsius, respectively.Chandigarh, the common capital of Haryana and Punjab, also experienced a hot day at 42.9 degrees Celsius -- four degrees above normal.Jammu recorded the hottest day of the season as the mercury settled at 42.6 degrees Celsius, 3.5 notches above the season's average, the MeT department said.The city recorded a low of 26.4 degrees Celsius, which was also 1.5 degrees above normal, it said.Srinagar recorded a maximum temperature of 30.3 degrees Celsius -- 4.2 notches above normal. It is a marginal drop from Tuesday's 31.7 degrees Celsius.Katra, the base camp for pilgrims visiting Vaishno Devi shrine in Reasi district, recorded a maximum temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 23.7 degrees Celsius.The weather department predicted isolated light rain or thunder in most parts of Jammu and Kashmir during the next 24 hours. But there will be an increase in precipitation over the subsequent two days.The IMD said the ongoing heatwave conditions in several parts of north and central India are very likely to continue on Thursday. It said some respite can be expected only towards the end of the week."Due to the prevailing dry north-westerly winds over plains of northwest India, central India and the adjoining interior parts of eastern India, the present heatwave conditions are very likely to continue during next 24 hours," it said. Heatwave conditions at many places with severe heatwave in isolated pockets are very likely over Vidarbha, west Rajasthan, it added.Heatwave conditions are also likely in some pockets over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, west Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and east Rajasthan, and in isolated pockets over Punjab, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Saurashtra and Kutch, central Maharashtra and Marathwada, Telangana and north interior Karnataka during the next 24 hours, according to the IMD.A western disturbance is likely to give some relief on May 29 and 30. During this period, parts of north India are likely to witness dust storms and thunderstorms, it said.Western disturbance is a cyclonic circulation which originates in the Mediterranean Sea. Traversing central Asia, it brings rains to the hills and plains when it comes in contact with the Himalayas.

Marketing is a serious concern and problem among many types of businesses. The managers and directors of those businesses have tried different ways and options but to no avail. They have reached the point on which they have thought of giving up. But there is one thing they can try which of course will bring a difference. And that is to search for and work with the marketing experts. Yes, everything has its experts. Those experts know the thing by skills and art. This includes marketing. Did you know that the achievement you have been trying to achieve in your business needs marketing? In fact, no business person should undervalue marketing in their business. As you know, business is all about competition. So, in order for you to stay ahead of the game, you need to maintain your current clients and attract new consumers. In doing so, you need quality service that will persuade your clients, then you need to tell those who haven't shopped or bought products and services that they are losing. So, when it comes to telling them, you need to be strategic. In the marketing world, there are many options. You need to make sure that you are using the deserving and fruitful marketing services. One of the promising marketing strategies is digital marketing. There are many people who are in business who would lie to use digital marketing for the benefits of their enterprises, but they are not capable. Perhaps you would like this to go that way, but you might not be capable or do not have the qualified staff in your business who can make it for you. The good news is that there are professional marketing experts that will help you. You simply have to visit their offices or websites and tell them what you want, they will take your business to a whole new level.

The judge said the victim's intoxicated state, Sauvager's "disregard" in providing her safe transport, his shifting of blame and his "complete lack of sympathy for the victim" – until he apologized in court on Wednesday – made his crime deserving of an upward departure from discretionary state sentencing guidelines, which called for no more than three months behind bars.


  Consequently, Johnson sentenced Sauvager to 20 years in prison with 15 years suspended, giving him a 5 full years to serve. He has been jailed since his Nov. 5 arrest, pleaded guilty in February and did not seek to be released on bond, his attorney said.


  The 27-year-old victim, according to the prosecution's summary of evidence, had become extremely intoxicated and incoherent on the evening of Nov. 2 and into the early morning hours of Nov. 3, while she was socializing with friends in Richmond. Her friends summoned a Lyft ride to take her to her Chesterfield home.


  In a statement later to police, Sauvager acknowledged that his passenger was one of the most intoxicated passengers he had driven and was hallucinating during the ride.


  The woman had little memory of getting into the Lyft driver's car or returning home due to her level of intoxication. When she regained consciousness in the backseat of the car outside her home, her clothes had been removed and Sauvager was on top of her, according to prosecutors.


  The woman then pushed Sauvager off, and as she did, Sauvager told her that the sexual contact was "consensual." The woman then ran into her home and went to sleep.


  After she woke up later that morning, the woman reported the incident to family members, and she went to a hospital about 9 a.m. to report that she had been sexually assaulted.


  "The defendant controlled the environment ... and had the ideal setting to attack" the woman, Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Frank LaRuffa told the court.

  "We worked really hard to get ready with six pages of requirements from the governor in 24 hours," she said. "It's a lot to get done."


   


  They created a hand sanitizer station, marked off booths for social distancing, created outdoor seating and more in a very short period of time to prepare for the reopening, Talley said. The effort has been worth it, though. When asked whether profits had increased over the weekend, Talley gave a firm, "Oh definitely."


   


  With good weather most of the weekend, Talley said, outdoor seating was a big hit.


   


  "People have really enjoyed eating outside. That's been very popular," she said. "I think people enjoyed being able to go back out and exercise their freedom to be able to eat indoors and dine and have someone wait on them."


   


  At the La Cocina on South Church Street, Burlington, managers said the dine- in availability was an absolute help for business.


   


  "We were pretty busy," a manager said Tuesday morning.


   


  The restaurant limited seating capacity inside and out to 50 percent as directed, limited tables to six guests or fewer, and blocked off some tables to ensure social distancing.


   


  According to the manager, there was only one incident when customers tried to seat seven individuals at one table, but all other customers followed the new social distancing rules at the restaurant.


   


  Ellen Hursey at Hursey's BBQ in Burlington said they were not as lucky with their dine-in business this weekend. They didn't advertise the reopening, and customers were slow to learn they could come inside again, she said.


   


  "We opened Friday, and we were not very busy. We had not advertised that we were opening," she explained. "It was a little better on Saturday, and [Monday] was fair.


   


  "Maybe when the word gets out it will be better," she added.


   


  Hursey said the restaurant is limiting capacity, following Health Department guidelines on cleaning, wearing masks, and "just doing everything we can to make sure we're safe and [the customers are] safe."


   


  While dining room business is taking some time to get back up and running, Hursey said takeout orders are still supporting the business.


   


  "The takeout has been good all through the quarantine and its still doing well. I think people are still maybe a little reluctant to come into dining rooms," she said.


   


  Other local businesses, however, have taken a slow and steady approach to reopening, such as Burlington Beer Works, which decided to reopen in stages. Outdoor seating by reservation only began Friday, May 22, while the restaurant's first floor indoor dining area will open at 50 percent capacity Tuesday, June 2, and the second floor will follow Tuesday, June 9.


   


  Other county restaurants that decided to slow their reopening plans include Blue Ribbon Diner and Junction on 70 in Mebane, and Mykonos Grill in Burlington, which reported it started reopening Tuesday.

Roland Garros chiefs insisted Wednesday that the French Open, delayed until September due to the coronavirus, will have fans attending even with social distancing rules.


  The claycourt Grand Slam, which should now have been into its first week under its traditional schedule, was pushed back by four months because of the pandemic.


  However, tickets bought for the event in its May-June slot were reimbursed rather than transferred, prompting fears that the tournament, now due to start on September 20, would be pushed behind closed doors.


  "In the autumn, we will play Roland Garros with an optimum spectator capacity which allows fans to respect social distancing," Jean-Francois Vilotte, the director-general of the French Tennis Federation (FFT), told AFP.


  A working group has already been created consisting of the ministries of sports and foreign affairs as well as Roland Garros officials and health bodies.


  "The aim is that there will be spectators but we will have the capacity to organise Roland Garros whatever the option decided, including behind closed doors."


  For the players, "the prize money is very important" as is the eco-system of tennis in France for which Roland Garros accounts for 80% of revenue.


  International tennis has been suspended globally since mid-March while Wimbledon was cancelled for the first time since World War II.


  The US Open in New York, due to start on August 24, is still under a cloud with organisers due to decide its fate in mid-June.

Centinaia di persone sono scese in piazza ieri sera a Minneapolis per manifestare contro la morte di George Floyd, bloccato a terra dalla polizia e morto poco dopo in ospedale.


  La tensione con la polizia è salita con gli agenti che, incalzati dall'avanzata dei manifestanti, sono ricorsi al lancio di gas lacrimogeni.


  Secondo le prime ricostruzioni della vicenda, alcuni agenti erano stati allertati sulla presenza di un uomo sospetto seduto in un'auto e che sembrava sotto l'influenza di sostanze stupefacenti. I poliziotti giunti sul posto gli hanno intimato di scendere ma l'uomo ha cominciato ad opporre resistenza. Gli agenti lo hanno così bloccato a terra e, mentre cercavano di ammanettarlo, uno di loro gli ha tenuto premuto il collo con un ginocchio.


  lL'intera sequenza è stata filmata da una passante in un video shock che adesso scuote gli Usa. "Per favore non riesco a respirare", si sente nel video. L'uomo implora più volte gli agenti ma invano, anche se visibilmente in sofferenza. Poi arriva un'ambulanza ma è troppo tardi. Morirà poco dopo.


  La polizia ha avviato un'indagine e quattro agenti sono stati sospesi. Anche loro indossavano body-cam.

  YouTube acknowledged Tuesday that it removed critical comments from the Chinese Communist Party from its video platform. The comments were removed in error, the company said, due to a "bug" in its systems for removing content that violates YouTube rules.


  A company spokeswoman said the withdrawals were not part of any policy change. "After review by our teams, we have confirmed that this was a bug in our application systems and we are working to fix it as quickly as possible," it said in a statement. The Verge previously reported on the takedowns.


  Video comments were automatically flagged by YouTube software filters. They included Chinese phrases that translate as "communist bandit" and "50-cent party," which are insulting to the nationalist government.


  The deletions occur when YouTube, which owns Google, faces strong criticism for its relationship with China. In 2010, Google pulled out of the Chinese search market after co-founder Sergey Brin cited the government's "totalitarian" policies, including web censorship.


  Google received a pushback two years ago for Project Dragonfly, an initiative to bring a censored search product to China. The effort reportedly would blacklist search terms disapproved by the Chinese government, such as "student protest" and "Nobel Prize." You may also have linked searches to people's phone numbers. Google employees and human rights defenders protested when the Dragonfly news broke.


  Google has also come under fire for its artificial intelligence laboratory in Beijing, which opened in 2017. Last year, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the search giant's work in the country is "indirectly benefiting the Chinese Army. " Pichai ended up meeting with Dunford and President Donald Trump that month to discuss Google's relationship with China.

Kolkata Even before the city could start dealing with the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan, a squall hit the city on Wednesday evening with wind speed up to 96km per hour. Exactly a week ago, Cyclone Amphan had battered the city with winds gusting up to 130km per hour. The city and is still limping back to normal and power supply is yet to be restored in some pockets.On Wednesday, a fire brigade official was electrocuted to death when he accidentally touched a live wire while carrying out restoration work in Howrah."We have lost a fire brigade officer. The power supply corporation had given us misleading information saying that supply had been cut off. The officer SS Roy was electrocuted to death. It is a criminal offence. I have asked the police to investigate and take action against the person responsible," Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal, said.The state government has already announced a compensation of ₹10 lakh for his family and has also promised a government job for one family member. The squall hit Kolkata around 6.20 pm, bringing rain. The India Meteorological Department's regional weather forecasting centre in Kolkata has forecasted that Friday could see some rain too. Strong winds have been blowing over the city and districts of south Bengal over the past few days."Some pockets where power connection was restored a few days after the cyclone, were again plunged into darkness on Wednesday after the storm as power lines snapped," an official of the state power department said. On May 20, Cyclone Amphan had hit the West Bengal coast with a wind speed up to 185km per hour. Large parts of south Bengal in eight districts plunged into darkness as more than 1.5 lakh km of power lines, including 30,000 km of high tension wire, snapped.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Give up, give in or give all


--DocBreak--
I do have a reputation for zinging onto some precarious topics so this months subject will not surprise you.


  I am currently hung up on obituaries. Not because I am old, I am no where near ready to “give up the ghost" as some say but I love newspapers and the Arizona Republic is a jewel in the obituary world. Sundays they crank out some eight pages of stuff about people who have “passed away,” “ gone to meet his/her savior" or “joined his/her family in heaven” while dying of the usual diseases that we humans are subject to.


  There are the usual listing of spouses, children, grands and greats who will, of course, miss the dear departed but some of these obits are seriously interesting. Some are a quarter to half a page of written matter, most have pictures. Many have pictures from their past, most look happy, sometimes they don’t.


  As I read some of those written by children, wives, someone who knew them, I am occasionally sorry I missed meeting them like the guy from Camp Verde, just north of Phoenix, whose life warranted a half page of his amazing life of helping others. Apparently, if you are willing to write it, they will print it. Even a wife who relates her first person story on losing her husband and best friend.


  One of the most interesting obits was a lady in her early 60s who died of cancer but must have been a hoot to know.


  “It is believed it (the cancer) was caused from the 61 years of having to teach everyone the proper way to do everything, backseat driving, micromanaging and overall pushing the people around her to their full potential.” I love it! This is the best part. “She left behind a dysfunctional family that she was very proud of, made up of a daughter, sons, ectera, ectera who will constantly miss her!" The whole article tells of her relationships, parties and favorite things like eating lemon drops in front of a TV movie. Kinda made you want to sit down and enjoy her wit.


  Some are young, “taken from us by a senseless act of violence.” Many are old or are pictured with treasured pets. One guy is a bit scary, pictured with no smile and arms folded across his chest. This guy had a family but most of the obituary featured his hunting, fishing and casino trips with his guy friends. So who wrote that story? The variety of names are a tell: English, Irish, Italian, Spanish, people in cowboy hats, suits and even fur coats.


  In between these accounts of long and not so long life stories are small ads in memorial (One particular guy died in 1997), ads for body donations, and caring sentiments and quotes that look like a copy from a sympathy card.


  One I liked in particular quoted George Washington Carver who said, “How far you go in life depends on you being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong. Because someday you will have been all of these.”


  See, you can even learn a few things about living from the obituaries.

Secondly, I would like to address your own tendency-shared by other Catholic luminaries as well-to speak as though reaching such a determination is a matter of indifference, even if it _is_ possible. “Saints have disagreed about who the actual pope is; some have even been wrong!” runs the next stage of the argument. (The name _Vincent Ferrer_ is almost certain to crop up at this stage.) It is telling, however, that this observation only cuts one way. As currently wielded, it means that people who accept Bergoglio as the successor of Saint Peter will be justified if they turn out to be wrong in the long run, while people who question the Argentinian’s papal validity in the first place are bad Catholics, _ipso facto._ You yourself, commendably, have backed off from this double standard markedly in recent days, but many others have not.

Instead of being remorseful, "he blames the victim," the prosecutor said. "He took advantage of a vulnerable woman."


  Both the prosecutor and judge noted Sauvager's references to the #MeToo movement in his attempts to deflect responsibility. He claimed the victim was "cruising for sexual activity" and played a role in what occurred. "I think women need to be held accountable, too," he was quoted as saying to authorities.


  "She initiated everything and I fell for it," Sauvager said. "It was just a stupid mistake."


  But in comments Wednesday before the judge meted out his punishment, Sauvager said he felt "terrible" and takes responsibility.


  "I caused grief and hardship on my family," he said. "I cheated on my wife."


  Sauvager, who has no prior criminal record, said he's been "beating myself up" during his nearly seven months in jail. "I'm forever sorry that I made that choice."


  The psychologist who conducted Sauvager's psychosexual evaluation determined that Sauvager had no underlying sexual deviations or mental illness, and was only a moderate risk to reoffend, his attorney, John Rockecharlie, told the court.


  At the time of the incident, Rockecharlie also noted that Sauvager's wife was suffering from cancer and the family, with two children ages 11 and 12, was experiencing financial hardship. Sauvager was trying to make ends meet after losing his job as a mechanic due to a medical condition.


  Because the family had no vehicle of their own, Sauvager had to rent a car so he could support his family by driving for Lyft, the attorney said.


  Rockecharlie, in urging an active sentence of no more than 12 months, said Sauvager "made a very bad choice that night" but so did the victim by drinking so excessively.


  "He should have been in a position that he should have been wiser than her," the attorney said.

Well frankly, every Protestant convert has to confront the fact that his or her own perspective simply isn’t, in the final analysis, the determining factor about anything. I have a good friend, for example, to whom I often try to explain points of Catholic belief while she patiently identifies which ones she agrees with, and which ones are out of luck. What I have yet to succeed in getting across to her is that her personal rejection of the Immaculate Conception, for instance, taints Our Blessed Mother not one spot. What I am trying to say is that _what you think,_ Dr. Marshall, doesn’t . . . well . . . matter. If someone dares to opine that Ratzinger may still be reigning, he or she immediately runs afoul of the “Karens of Bergoglianism,” ever ready to issue the scolding reminder that “Francis” is “the Pope” whether we like it or nor! Nobody ever points out, however, that there is a flipside to this very coin. If “Francis” actually _isn’t_ “the Pope,” then all the Karens in the world can’t make him one.

While it may appear prudent to some in government to let “New Space” actors find their footing before committing to long-term cooperation (especially in the middle of an economic crisis), “opting out” would be both an abdication of responsibility and a signal that the risk aversion that has permeated our community culture for so long is not abating.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — A mental health provider cannot be held liable for the actions of a man accused of a 2018 Florida high school massacre, an appeals court ruled Wednesday. Henderson Behavioral Health Inc. treated Nikolas Cruz off and on from 2009 to 2016, court records show. Cruz had multiple mental issues, including a fascination with violence, weapons and death, but was eventually mainstreamed into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. That school was where Cruz is accused of fatally shooting 17 people and wounding 17 others in the Valentine's Day 2018 attack. At the time, he was no longer a student there. Parents of some victims sued Henderson and others, claiming that a failure to prevent the attack amounted to negligence. The 4th District Court of Appeal agreed Wednesday with a lower court that Henderson could not be held negligent for failing to prevent Cruz from being mainstreamed into school and not adequately warning school officials about his “dangerous propensities.” “Although there may be a special relationship between Henderson and Cruz and separately between the high school and its students, there is no special relationship between a student patient’s mental health provider and other students who attend school with the patient,” the judges wrote. “In this case, a holding that Henderson owed a legal duty to protect or warn students that attended the same school as one of its patients would not only undermine effective patient-therapist relationships, but it also would discourage mental health professionals from providing mental health services to students,” they added. The court also noted that the final decision on mainstreaming Cruz was made by the Broward County School Board, with input from Henderson and...

May is Mental Health Awareness Month. I’ve written on mental health before and some of the experiences that I’ve seen in myself and my family. While still a taboo subject, sometimes it is one that needs to be discussed for people to realize that they are not alone, and that there are options out there that may help.


  There was a post on social media this week from a gentlemen who I follow on Twitter. It said he did not personally know anyone who had contracted COVID-19, but he did know seven individuals that had committed suicide in the last week.


  A lot of lives have been affected the last couple of months by the pandemic. While some heartwarming stories that have come out of the rubble, they seem to be few and far between. Add in a couple challenging days here or there, and those days seem to become even longer. It is easy to lose hope.


  A couple things happened last week that were a struggle. I lost a cow to a freak accident while AI’ing. I forgot to gate a trailer compartment and ended up with my ATV heading to the local repair shop. And there were a couple other things that just did not go right. It’s easy to get bogged down in those days, and it’s also extremely difficult not to let them control the rest of the day. The Boss Man has always been pretty levelheaded and low key about things. He has the philosophy that no matter how bad it gets “it is what it is.”

Nearly 550 migrant workers have been sent back to their home state Uttarakhand from Uttar Pradesh's Gautam Buddh Nagar in the last three days, officials said on Wednesday. Over the last few weeks, thousands of migrant workers stranded due to the coronavirus lockdown have been sent to their homes in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand, among other places, from Gautam Buddh Nagar adjoining Delhi, the officials said. The decision to arrange transport and send back the stranded migrant workers is in compliance of an Uttar Pradesh government order, District Information Officer Rakesh Chauhan said. "On Tuesday, 409 migrants embarked on journey to their homes in Uttarakhand on 12 buses. The buses were stationed at Greater Noida and in Noida. Earlier on May 24, 140 migrants returned to Uttarakhand on board six buses," he said. The process was overseen by District Magistrate Suhas L Y, Police Commissioner Alok Singh and officer in-charge for COVID-19 response in Gautam Buddh Nagar Narendra Bhooshan, Chauhan said.

NOIDA The 7am to 7pm timing for shops and marketplaces is not working for the shop owners in Gautam Budh Nagar, who now get to open their individual shops only on alternate days. The representatives of different markets said their timings collides with the office timings and as Sunday has been mandated as sanitization day, the markets are yet to see sales picking up.Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 market association, said taking cognisance of traders' problems, the government must change the 12-hour curfew from 7pm to 7am. "Most of our customers are either at work or running their own businesses. They do not get the time to shop after returning offices. And, on Sunday, a holiday when many could hit the markets, the shops are mandatorily closed for disinfection and sanitization," he said.Jain said traders do not have a problem with the 12-hour curfew. "We just want the curfew timings to change slightly. Even if it is rescheduled, say, from 10pm to 10am, we will be happy as most customers will then have time to visit our shops even after returning home from work," he said.Echoing similar views, CB Jha, president of Atta market association, said in the present scenario, traders will not be able to sustain themselves for a long time. "Expenses have gone up due to the pandemic and the returns are negligible. The highest daily sale recorded at our market today (Wednesday) and was to the tune of ₹1,000. Even if it increases at a rate of 20%, the monthly income of a shopkeeper, who gets to open shop only every alternate day would be around ₹20,000. How can we meet the rent, staff salaries and other expenses with this earning? We are waiting for the Prime Minister's speech Sunday. If he does not come up with some major relaxations, we have unanimously decided to down our shutters permanently," he said.Zakir Hussain, who runs a jewellery shop in Sector 22, said despite giving regular GST returns, the small and medium businessmen are the biggest sufferers. "If the government can provide monetary assistance to farmers and MSME entrepreneurs, the small and middle level businessmen should also be the part of the beneficiaries' bracket," he said.Anita Singh, who runs a stationary shop in Sector 18, said shopkeepers of different markets in Noida are keeping their fingers crossed. "We are waiting for the fourth phase of the lockdown to end on May 31. After that, we will take a call on how to proceed. The government has nothing for us in its recently announced ₹2 lakh crore package. We have no subsidy on electricity bills. The interest on our bank loans is mounting up every day," she said.When contacted, district magistrate Suhas LY said his administration is working on all possible relief measures for businessmen. "We will also consider the issue of changing the curfew timing," he said.

The official line on the fate of the Franklin expedition went largely unchallenged until just six years ago, when Canadian archaeologists located and visited the remains of both _Terror_ and _Erebus_. _Terror_ , they discovered, had been successfully navigated south from Victory Point, and _Erebus_ probably drifted south with the melting ice and sank without a crew on board.

There's a new floating control bar called Edge Touch that gives you quick access to apps, the notification shade, and multitasking with swipe actions. You can also double-tap the bar to toggle the edge display on and off. That re-flows apps to keep them primarily on the flat part of the display, limiting the UI melt over the edge. However, I've noticed a few apps don't remember that setting between sessions. In addition, you can't disable the edge display on the home screen, Moto app, and a few other places.

Today, the U.S. is preoccupied with overcoming COVID-19, a threat first and foremost to public health but also to our domestic economy. Prior to the emergence of the coronavirus, America’s economy was on a tear: Record-low unemployment across the board, record-high stock market valuations, and an annual gross domestic product growth rate of 2-4%.  The pandemic slammed on the proverbial brakes, and a government-industry plan for how we recover from the resulting downturn is, at best, neither fully formed nor articulated.

Another explanation, first offered by psychologists and then taken up by historian John Waller, is also persuasive: the dancing plague was the result of mass psychogenic illness. This type of disorder is triggered by emotional or mental stress, and the medieval period was rife with war, plague and famine. In the 14th century, flooding in the Rhine saw water levels rise to 34 feet, submerging Strasbourg and causing devastation, which was followed by disease and starvation. And in the decade prior to the 1518 dance, Strasbourg was ravaged by plague, famine and a severe outbreak of syphilis, leaving its people in despair. Could these terrible hardships be, then, the reason why sufferers of the dancing plague seemed to dissociate from their bodies and become lost in a strange reverie, bruised, bloody and cavorting without rest, sometimes for weeks at a time?

GILBERT, Ariz. (AP) — Brian Morris faced a difficult scenario when the coronavirus pandemic started leading to shutdowns across the nation. If Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey opted to include bike shops among the businesses deemed nonessential, Freeride Bike Company, which he owns with his wife Ashleigh, would have to shutter its doors for who knows how long. When Ducey deemed bike shops essential, it turned out to be huge boon for their business as cooped-up Americans sought ways to go outside and get moving. “We’ve seen a huge spike in sales across the board, from beach cruisers all the way up to high-end mountain bikes, road bikes,” Brian Morris said. “A lot of tubes, tires tools as a lot of people are learning to do home repairs with a lot of shops being overloaded in service. We have seen a major spike and had a hard time keeping up with the demand at times.” The pandemic has had a devastating impact on retail as businesses across the country were forced to close their doors for weeks at a time. In the sporting goods industry, the impact has depended on the focus of the business. Stores that rely on in-store sales have taken a big hit. Dick's Sporting Goods, one of the largest national sporting goods chains, was forced to close all its stores on March 19 and furloughed a significant number of its 40,000 employees in early April. The company started reopening some stores in recent weeks. Modell's Sporting Goods filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early March, but a judge approved an emergency request to mothball the case once the pandemic hit. Stores selling uniforms and equipment for team sports also saw massive revenue declines as sports leagues across the U.S. went dark during the pandemic.
