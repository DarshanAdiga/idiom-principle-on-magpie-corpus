When all else fails and you want to give yourself negative feedback for procrastinating, resist and instead think of rewarding yourself for positive behavior instead. Why? Because so many of you are still motivated by fear and instead of affirming the status quo, let’s do something that will actually work in the long run. All of us grew up with years of “negative consequences” but research has shown us that positive feedback and rewards are much more effective than threats, fear and force. Perhaps negative consequences will get you going again but you will most likely have to shock your system. If you have a long history of not keeping your agreements with yourself or finishing your commitments, you may want to have a serious conversation about who is running the show in your life. You have too many internal masters and not enough directions. Figure out what is important and then take baby steps.

The letter stoked new outrage among the state's watchdogs -- and warnings that things are going to get uglier.
 "I only think the number is going to go north," said Michael Hestrin, Riverside County district attorney.
 Greg Totten, Ventura County DA, noted that only two weeks ago, prosecutors estimated the fraud's toll appeared to be about $400 million with potential to go to $1 billion.
 The new numbers, he said, are "incredible. It's a reflection of the artfulness of some criminal enterprises."
 He and others were again critical of EDD.
 "I don't know who was at the wheel. It appears there was no system set up to check," Hestrin said.
 He said not only were debit cards going out of state, but it appears they were going to recipients overseas.
 EDD came under new fire from Sacramento lawmakers.
 "It's egregious that my constituents make a single typo that holds up their EDD benefits for months, while an inmate on death row can use a fake name and still get benefits paid out," said Assemblyman David Chiu, D-San Francisco, a frequent EDD critic.
 "Our offices have to jump through hoops to get our constituents the benefits they need and yet, EDD is sending debit cards to state prisons without question," he said. "That doesn't add up."

The world underestimated just how big the already-huge tech industry could become, said Roseanne Wincek, an investor at Renegade Partners. “More and more people are waking up to that,” she said.


  On Wednesday, DoorDash plans to list its shares and go public at a valuation as high as $35.3 billion, more than double its last private valuation. The company increased its proposed price range to $90 to $95 a share Friday, up from $75 to $85. The listing may help redeem SoftBank, the swashbuckling mega- fund that was humbled last year by a spate of bad investments in startups such as real estate company WeWork.


  Airbnb, which was crippled by the travel shutdowns in the spring, then plans to go public the next day. On Monday, the company raised the proposed price range on its listing to $56 to $60 a share, up from $44 to $50 a share previously. That could increase its valuation to as high as $42 billion, or 32% above where it was before the pandemic.


  Private startups normally raise funding every 12 to 18 months, but with investors furiously competing to give them money, that timeline has now shrunk to three to six months, entrepreneurs and investors said. Some startups are even closing back-to-back rounds of funding at higher valuations.

It helps to analyze hunger pangs. Being hungry is natural – and eating is a wonderful thing. However, eating sugary, caffeinated, processed foods to fill an emotional need is not so good – and often a symptom of self-sabotage, which can have adverse long-term effects. Keep in mind that what we do 90% of the time is what counts, so enjoy a slice of birthday cake, or another treat, with a family member or loved one occasionally. But in general, when hungry, ask yourself what healthy options are available. If no healthy options come to mind, it is likely not hunger influencing the desire to eat. At these times, and considering the importance of staying hydrated, try having a big glass of water or a tisane at. You will find that this often helps cure false hunger pangs!

1. Stigma and stereotypes are deadly and prevent people from seeking help for themselves or a loved one. I come from three generations of well-educated women who, unbeknownst to each of us, married _affluent_ men whose drinking progressed into the depths of alcoholism with all its tragic pain and losses. I call addiction a “sickness of silence” because it is shrouded in secrets and shame. Neither my dear grandmother nor mother ever shared their stories or struggles with me or the wisdom they gained.                    2. I wish I’d understood that ‘high functioning’ alcoholics are just as addicted as people who have less control over their behavior. It was a mystery how my husband could drink so much and still be standing! But a time came when he spiraled out of control and experienced ‘rock bottom.’                    3. Neuroscience has brought important knowledge to the addiction field that has removed some of the shame and fear that surrounds addiction. Just this aspect has changed the way we perceive the problems people are facing. People can Google any aspect of addiction to gain understanding and research possible options for help.                    4. In the early 1990s I could never have imagined the extent of the potential risk or danger of the pharmaceutical industry aggressively marketing pain medication through the healthcare industry and the immense suffering it’s caused to individuals, families, and communities.                    5. I wish I had permission in the 1990s when I began to train addiction counselors and recovery support staff to really focus my approach and content on the concept of Emotional Sobriety. Bill Wilson, the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, used this term in a private letter to a friend concerning his hopes for the future wave of recovery efforts. I have made Emotional Sobriety my theme and core premise in training professional recovery coaches and will bring it into all of my future work.

1. When leading, be careful with using hyperbolic language. In my prior life as a talent agent, hyperbolic language helped me sign clients and get people enthusiastic about my ideas and projects I was selling. As a leader, I realized when I was using hyperbolic language it became detrimental for my team to align.                    2. You can never repeat yourself enough when it comes to preaching your mission, values and why you are solving this problem. I know this advice is written in almost every book on entrepreneurship but I didn’t take it to heart until we started growing. I kept hearing people question what we are doing even though our mission is written on the 1st slide of every all hands deck and we use our values as a rubric for hiring and performance management. Will Quist, who recently invested in Stem, described it as “preaching these things as if they are your religion” and he’s not exaggerating.                    3. Find at least 2 other female founder friends and lean on each other. If it wasn’t for Melody McCloskey (founder of Styleseat) encouraging me to take the plunge into entrepreneurship and offering to be part of my support system, I don’t know if I would be here. She’s answered my calls and helped me think through various issues ranging from technical decisions to coaching me through preparing for my first board meeting. Katerina Schneider (founder of Ritual) and I started our entrepreneurial journeys around the same time. We trade notes frequently on everything from recruiting, managing, and culture building. We are almost exact foils of each other so it’s been really helpful having her point out my potential blind spots and offer a different perspective on issues. We take long walks together and vent to each other — I feel lighter every time afterward.                    4. Indulge in your days off and forgive yourself for bumming around the house and binge watching mindless television. Do not be afraid to let your team know when you are taking time off. You cannot show up for your team and lead if you are burning out. It is also quite likely that when you feel burned out, so do others on your team. Internally we call these “clarity breaks.” I like this term because it sounds productive. It is as if I took a long hike in the woods and plopped down somewhere scenic with a journal to clear my head and be inspired. In reality, I’m in my pajamas, likely haven’t left my bed, and am on my 6th episode of an aspirational reality TV show about cooking or home renovations. I need a day like this every quarter to do nothing without guilt so that I can recharge. I do find that in the week following I am more motivated to work out, journal and am able to think more clearly.                    5. Write your annual “Win List.” Every year around mid December I ask myself to write down 10 things that I would consider a win if they were to happen by this time next year. They are a combination of business wins, personal life wins and ego wins. Throughout the year, I look back on this list which I keep on my notes app. It helps orient me if I lose sight of my progress or direction. I always revisit the previous years list and reflect on why certain wins were or were not accomplished. It is interesting to notice how priorities may change or how certain wins that seem unrealistic happen to manifest. I also ask my direct reports to do this exercise. It’s a great window into what drives them and what I can do to help them “win.”

1. I wish someone told me that “its not going to be easy” to chase your dreams, to actually become the next big thing in tech, and to achieve success. We are all so deeply invested in looking at the success that we never think about the grunt work and the long nights that go into achieving that success. There are days when you wont get to have a meal for 20 hours at a go cause of back to back meetings, when you would just lose a contract and the world seems to be crumbling down, and when it would seem as if all efforts are futile. You have to keep pushing forward and focus on the next day.                    2. I wish someone told me that “leading is tougher than it looks”. Being a leader at Wing, I have a lot of responsibilities on my shoulders, I have people who look to me for direction and mentorship, I have teams who are following a roadmap I have built, and I have stakeholders who have have entrusted their faith in me to lead the company forward. Part of being a good leader, as I have come to learn, involves not one but many functions — listening to your team’s concerns, creating an open work environment, trusting your team members that they are acting in the best interest of the company, trusting your gut as your decisions could impact the entire functioning of the company, and sometimes even acknowledging that you may not be right about something. Its fun 😀                    3. I wish someone told me that “team work makes the dream work”. At the end of the day, it is the team that has to stick together and make sure the trains keep moving forward. Running a company is not a one man show. People come together, form ideas, and that’s how you create a billion dollar company. As a founder it is important for me to make sure that the value of team work is something we set from the top down.                    4. I wish someone told me that “you have to focus on the big picture”. Running a startup and then leading it to become the next unicorn (or decacorn) is not about “I got us here” but “we got here” — that’s what matters, and something that I have learnt is that you cannot only focus on the small things. Celebrate the small wins definitely but dont make it an issue about who gets credit for that small win. That is the single most deteriorating thing to success. Everybody deserves to get their moment — if they have worked hard for something, then I make it my personal duty to make sure they get rewarded for it.                    5. And last, I wish someone told me “to never get emotionally attached to a product”. We are running a business and part of it is developing products for others, not just for yourself. Something that may fit perfectly into your world may not fit into the broader’s group’s world. And being able to accept the truth and letting go of something that you may have been working on for days — that’s I think the hardest challenge for a developer. It is never an easy call to make, but as a leader, sometimes even the toughest and critical of decisions are on me to take. Everything we do at Wing is to add more value to our customer’s lives and to make their lives easier.

Bloomberg) -- Contracts to buy Manhattan luxury homes are faring well even in the pandemic, with more deals signed in the past three months than in the same period last year.


  There were 227 contracts for homes priced at $4 million or more from Sept. 1 to Dec. 6, according to a report Monday by brokerage Olshan Realty. A year ago, there were 219.


  Rising stock portfolios and deep discounts on some of Manhattan’s most exclusive homes are luring buyers back to the luxury market, even as New York remains largely shuttered by Covid-19. Low mortgage rates are an added motivator, along with consumer optimism that vaccines will be available soon, according to the report.


  “Many of the buyers are New Yorkers, who obviously believe in the city’s eventual recovery,” Donna Olshan, president of the luxury brokerage, wrote in the report.


  Last week’s biggest deal was a resale of a 58th-floor condo at One57, the Billionaires’ Row tower that touched off Manhattan’s luxury-development boom a decade ago. The 4,483-square-foot (416-square-meter) apartment, on the market since March, was last listed at $22.25 million. That’s at least 35% less than what the seller paid in 2014, though the actual sale price won’t be known until the deal closes.


  “It’s a tough deal for the seller, but a great deal on the buy side,” Ryan Serhant, the broker representing the purchaser, said in Olshan’s report.


  Extell Development, the company that built One57 -- on 57th Street near Carnegie Hall -- didn’t respond to a request for comment on the deal. While the developer isn’t a party to the resale transaction, it’s still working to sell units in the building that have yet to find takers.


  Asking Price


  Last week’s second-biggest contract was for a full-floor unit at the Benson, a condo project under construction on Madison Avenue near 80th Street on the Upper East Side. The 15th-story apartment found a buyer who agreed to pay the full asking price of $14.15 million, said Miki Naftali, chief executive officer of the developer, Naftali Group.


  Sales started at the Benson in September, just as well-heeled buyers who had retreated to country homes across the U.S. were starting to become interested again in city living, Naftali said.


  “I hear from more and more people who moved to the Hamptons, Connecticut or New Jersey, that they are eager to come back,” Naftali said. “Some of them are starting to be bored where they live.”


  Others coming to look at the project are people who at last were able to sell their lavish homes in suburbs like Greenwich, Connecticut, and are free to make the move to Manhattan, he said.


  Including last week’s deal, four of the Benson’s 15 units have gone into contract -- all at the asking price, including a penthouse listed at $35 million, Naftali said.


  Manhattan’s luxury market -- still awash in inventory that’s clinging to 2014-era prices -- has a way to go to reach a full recovery. In the same three-month period in 2018, there were 260 signed deals at $4 million or more, Olshan’s data show. In 2017, there were 308.

LANSING -- Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration on Monday added 12 more days to a partial shutdown of businesses and schools to curb the coronavirus.
   
 The extended order, now due to end Dec. 20, will enable the state health department to assess how Thanksgiving travel affected the spread of COVID-19, the Democratic governor said.
   
 In-person instruction at high schools, dine-in eating at restaurants and organized sports will continue to be prohibited. Entertainment venues such as movie theaters and bowling alleys will remain closed.
   
 "Hope is on the horizon, but we need an additional 12 days to determine the full impact of the Thanksgiving holiday on our efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus," Whitmer said in a statement released at the start of a news conference. "This is all about protecting our families and front-line workers until we eradicate this virus once and for all."
   
 The administration also identified three key metrics it will use to determine whether to slowly reopen after Dec. 20: the percentage of hospital beds with COVID-19 patients, the number of cases and the positivity rate. The priority will be reopening high schools, then entertainment businesses where people can consistently wear masks such as casinos, theaters and bowling alleys, with concessions closed.
   
 Earlier Monday, Michigan hospital officials said the restrictions were effective and should be extended through the holiday season to alleviate stress on the health care system.
   
 The chief medical officers of hospitals and health systems issued a joint statement saying the order is slowly stabilizing the spread of COVID-19.
   
 "As a state, we must not let our guard down and reverse this progress," they said, reporting slight declines in virus-related emergency room visits, daily admissions and total hospitalizations.
   
 The restrictions, many of which were in place earlier in the pandemic, took effect Nov. 18.
   
 The seven-day average of daily new cases was 6,918 on Sunday, down from 7,604 two weeks before, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The rate of tests coming back positive, 12.4%, was up from 11.3%. The average daily death count was 122 -- an increase from 71.3 on Nov. 22 -- and the fourth-highest in the country.
   
 More than 4,100 people were hospitalized with symptoms, including about 500 on ventilators.

Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer borrowing rose in October by less than forecast, reflecting a decline in credit-card balances as the pandemic continued to limit some purchases.


  Total credit increased $7.2 billion from the prior month after a downwardly revised $15 billion September gain, Federal Reserve figures showed Monday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a $15.5 billion increase in October. Revolving credit declined for the seventh time in the past eight months.


  A $5.5 billion drop in credit-card debt outstanding to a more than three-year low coincides with a slowdown in retail sales during the month, when consumers took a breather after the strongest-ever quarterly pace of spending. Record coronavirus infections that lead to a tightening of government restrictions on activity, along with signs job growth is easing, risk further restraining household outlays and borrowing.


  The absence of additional government financial support to the millions of unemployed Americans is also seen limiting the consumer expenditures that make up the largest share of gross domestic product.


  Revolving credit decreased to $979.6 billion, the lowest since May 2017.


  Non-revolving debt, which includes auto and school loans, rose by $12.7 billion, the most in three months. Lending by the federal government, which is mainly for student loans, increased by $4.5 billion before seasonal adjustment.


  Total consumer credit for the month rose an annualized 2.1% after growing at a 4.4% pace in September. The Fed’s report doesn’t track debt secured by real estate, such as home mortgages.

But really start looking for that small community — start with virtual to make friends, attend meetups, etc.                    2. Set up dinners. So instead of going out to eat twice a week with different people, have a big dinner. Those are important because for me, I’ll have these dinners and sometimes we don’t even talk about wellness, we just connect. We just want to connect and feel like we’re vibing. Even if someone’s talking about something random, we could still vibe because it’s a passion that’s overriding.                    3. Go to your neighbor’s house. Go talk to them and see how open they are about building a community in your own neighborhood. When I lived in New Jersey, I didn’t even know my neighbor. Get out of your comfort zone, go next door to say hey, and offer them something. And I think that’s something really powerful we can do to help foster community, just every day in our own neighborhood, and they don’t even have to be like-minded people.                    4. If you can’t meet up with your neighbor, then go to a centralized part of your town. For example, if you have a dog, go to a dog park. That’s the best way to go. When I went to PA school for a little bit, I would take my dog to the dog park, and then I’d meet so many new people because by default, you already have a common interest — dogs. So having that common interest opens up a safe space for folks to talk about other things, like what part of town they live in, or what’s their favorite restaurant. It’s hard for people who are super introverted, or don’t like being out of their comfort zone. But these are times that we can really make a massive shift.                    5. Lastly, it might be hard to find your community. There might not be any existing Instagram pages for what you need, so _create_ your own community. The beautiful thing is when you create with intent, you attract. So, for folks who want to build pillows, start your own blog, Instagram or Facebook. And then all you need is to meet 10 like-minded people and then you already have your sense of community. You can meet up with those people. It’s not only for the mental but it also addresses the physical.

A relationship is nothing without clear, consistent communication. Without communication, in my experience, any relationship is bound to fail. It is important for married couples to set aside time to resolve issues, discuss differences, or simply check-in with each other to ensure they are on the same page. Every relationship has its ups and downs and love alone won’t address complex issues within a marriage. It is the ability to have honest conversations about what is not working, develop an action plan to resolve issues, and the ability to move forward that will correct any communication barriers you may experience.

Several inmates already executed on death row were convicted under provisions of that bill, including ones that made kidnappings and carjackings resulting in death federal capital offenses.


  The race of those set to die buttresses criticism that the bill disproportionately impacted Black people. Four of the five set to die over the next few weeks are Black. The fifth, Lisa Montgomery, is white. Convicted of killing a pregnant woman and cutting out the baby alive, she is the only female of the 61 inmates who were on death row when executions resumed, and she would be the first woman to be executed federally in nearly six decades.


  The executions so far this year have been by lethal injection at a U.S. penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, where all federal executions take place. The drug used to carry out the sentences is sparse. The Justice Department recently updated protocols to allow for executions by firing squad and poison gas, though it’s unclear if those methods might be used in coming weeks.


  Barr suddenly announced in July 2019 that executions would resume, though there had been no public clamor for it. Several lawsuits kept the initial batch from being carried out, and by the time the Bureau of Prisons got clearance the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing. The virus has killed more than 282,000 people in the United States, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Facing global anger over their initial mishandling of the outbreak, Chinese authorities are now trying to rewrite the narrative of the pandemic by pushing theories that the virus originated outside China.
 In recent days, Chinese officials have said that packaged food from overseas might have initially brought the virus to China. Scientists have released a paper positing that the pandemic could have started in India. The state news media has published false stories misrepresenting foreign experts, including Kekulé and officials at the World Health Organization, as having said the coronavirus came from elsewhere.
 The campaign seems to reflect anxiety within the ruling Communist Party about the continuing damage to China’s international reputation brought by the pandemic. Western officials have criticized Beijing for trying to conceal the outbreak when it first erupted.
 The party also appears eager to muddy the waters as the WHO begins an investigation into the question of how the virus jumped from animals to humans, a critical inquiry that experts say is the best hope to avoid another pandemic. China, which has greatly expanded its influence in the WHO in recent years, has tightly controlled the effort by designating Chinese scientists to lead key parts of the investigation.

Thriving and burnout go hand-in-hand with mental health, which is something that’s personally close to my heart. Discussing my own experiences with mental health and the support systems I created has helped my team and business relationships grow. A challenge with working remotely that many organizations are facing today is identifying and managing the balance between work and home life. It can be very easy for the lines between personal/professional lives to blur and to create an expectation of being “always on” for your team, which leads to burnout quickly. As a leader, you set the tone for the rest of the team — so it’s important to be intentional about 1) setting appropriate expectations among the team that they aren’t expected to be dedicated their lives to working around the clock and 2) walking the talk and leading by example. If I am intentional about prioritizing my mental health and that of my team, they’ll follow that lead.

It’s important to remember that the report has many thoughtful recommendations beyond the question about entrepreneur shareholders. And their question does not deserve suggestions of suspicious timing (why now), conspiracy (who for), dyslexia (we can’t improve supervision), fatalism (we won’t improve supervision), and contested history (fraud, not ideology, drove nationalisation). The notion that financial institutions with tiny shareholders, professional management, and boards that ban shareholders are infallible ignores Indian evidence (most recent financial accidents involved institutions that don’t have entrepreneurs and met current ownership guidelines) and global evidence (foreign banks idealised in the current debate made losses in the 2008 financial crisis that exceeded all profits made since the Medicis invented banking in 15th century Florence). This blind spot is the agency problem highlighted by the new book, Lights Out, about two CEOs at General Electric where a new board member’s question to a tenured member about the role of the board of directors gets the unforgettable answer of “Applause”.

Nearly 10% of all misdemeanor cases presented to Gascón during his time in office in the Bay Area were diverted to pre-trial alternative sentencing programs. Criminal justice reform activists generally support such reforms, saying they reduce crime in the long-term by sparing people criminal records that make finding work or housing difficult. Law enforcement officials, however, often contend prosecuting people serves as a deterrent that cuts down on repeat offenders.


  Gascón also said he would put an end to the use of sentencing enhancements, which prosecutors have long used to win longer sentences for people who, for example, are alleged to belong to gangs or used of a firearm while committing a crime. Gascón has criticized the enhancement, saying they have to excessive time behind bars for a wide range of defendants. The district attorney’s office,he said, will review “thousands” of cases in which defendants in L.A. County were sentenced under the enhancement rules — a move that could lead to prisoners having their sentences reduced prison stays or, in some cases, being released.


  Along with promising to re-open four police shooting cases that Lacey declined to prosecute, Gascón also announced the creation of a use-of-force review board that will investigate a number of other police killings going back to 2012 for possible prosecution. Families of those killed by police in L.A. County will also now be able to seek the same services as crime victims from the district attorney’s office.

 “An average person who get’s exposed to COVID on Thursday, a Thanksgiving, is likely to get symptoms maybe the Tuesday following, or the Thursday following, so that would be last week,” Dr. Nafziger says.
 He adds this week would likely be when people are sick enough to seek hospitalization, and its possible providers are starting to see that rise now.

Last camp, obviously, Lindsey Horan, who plays in the midfield. I have been playing midfield for about a year now. I just tried to learn as much from her as I could, on and off the field. She is obviously a wonderful player, and is very welcoming as well. So I was just taking in as much as I could from her. I was trained to keep my ground as well, because I obviously knew that they're so amazing, but I also knew that I have something to bring to the table, you know?

“For the last five years, our phenomenal team at ATG has been at the forefront of this effort — and in joining forces with Aurora, they are now in pole position to deliver on that promise even faster,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber CEO, in a statement. “I’m looking forward to working with Chris, and to bringing the Aurora Driver to the Uber network in the years ahead.”


  Uber will lose a critical piece of its company after the pandemic cut into its finances by suppressing demand for shared rides. Its path to profitability has often been linked with its plans to deploy autonomous vehicles and reduce the high cost of paying drivers.


  The company's efforts around self-driving technology was marred in March 2018 when one of its automated test vehicles hit and killed a woman, the first death involving the technology. The backup Uber driver involved in the crash was charged with negligent homicide for being distracted in the moments before fatally striking the woman in suburban Phoenix.


  “There’s no doubt they had a pretty rough couple of years a while back,” Urmson said. “What’s been impressive to me in meeting the team over the last little while is just how much the team has learned, and the tenaciousness, and determination of the team as they come to market in a thoughtful, safe way.”


  Aurora, based in Mountain View, Calif., is led by former Google, Tesla and Uber executives. Aurora also has partnerships with delivery giant Amazon and auto companies Hyundai and Kia, among others, but its partnership with Uber is its first official relationship with a ride-hailing company.


  The deal means Uber will be entrusting a key piece of its future to a 3-year- old startup co-founded and run by one of the engineers who launched Google’s pioneering work in self-driving cars more than a decade ago. Urmson was one of the most visible people involved in the once-secret project that Google initially dubbed “Chauffeur” before it was finally spun off into a separate company called Waymo. Google and Waymo remain closely aligned under the same corporate parent, Alphabet.

Taxes have been around since the dawn of civilization. The Egyptians came up with the concept over 5,000 years ago and the way that people have managed taxes hasn’t evolved much since the early days. In our digital-first, global society, compliance has become more complicated than ever before as taxes vary by jurisdiction and are constantly changing. Yet, despite the increased complexity and obligation placed on businesses, many are still managing tax compliance with nothing more than a telephone or web browser, and a spreadsheet. Some businesses even ignore tax together and just make up a single rate. We believe the concept of doing a transactional statutory compliance requirement (sales tax) manually in the digital world is absurd and we’re disrupting how the world thinks about tax compliance. In 10–20 years, I believe there will no longer be any businesses doing sales tax manually. Automation is the solution for businesses that want to unload an obligation that creates hassle and liability, and the states will continually demand to have taxes paid faster and in a more efficient manner.

The reigning premiers always go into the following season as a strong candidate. The Sixers obviously played some really good cricket last year, they've got a really good squad again and they'll get some really good players back at the back end of the tournament. If they're playing good cricket with those guys coming back in, they'll be tough to beat. And I think the Scorchers will be interesting. They've had a lot of injuries over the past couple of years and if they can get those guys back on the park, they'll be a pretty good unit as well. But as is the case every year, you only need a couple of guys to burst out of the blocks and start playing well or a young player comes up out of the blue to have a good tournament and that team generally goes pretty well. I think everyone's got a chance to do well and with five teams in finals, most would think they're a chance to play finals this season.

The Heat acquired Iguodala in a three-team trade in February, and as he regained his footing, the coronavirus pandemic suspended the season indefinitely.


  Iguodala, the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association, helped coordinate the season’s restart in a bubble environment at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida, collaborating on protocols for a return and fielding phone calls from concerned players.


  Some voiced hesitation, worried that resuming play would distract from calls for social justice after the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota.


  The NBA’s return featured Black Lives Matter wording near center court, and many players wore league-sanctioned messaging on the back of their jerseys.


  “You do see the sports leagues taking more of a stance,” said Iguodala, who chose to have “Group Economics” on the back of his jersey instead of his last name. Iguodala added that for leagues with a majority-Black workforce, like the NBA: “I think there’s a moral compass there. And so you have to take some type of stance. And it’s not really a political stance — it’s a human stance.”


  Then, in August, Iguodala became one of the most vocal players during a series of meetings after the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin.


  The players initiated a work stoppage of playoff games until the league’s franchise owners agreed to specific commitments, including searching for ways to provide voting access to underrepresented communities.


  “How you get so many African American athletes of that wealth to be able to come out stronger as a whole, as a union, that was a beautiful thing, regardless of what people may have thought would happen,” Iguodala said. “Just seeing all of us being able to have dialogue, whether we agreed or we disagreed with one another, that was huge.”


  Iguodala ended the season in his sixth consecutive finals, where Miami lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.


  “The bubble was the perfect environment for us, because of how they mentally train the guys to take on any challenge,” Iguodala said. “We were just ready for it, and we made the most of it.”


  Iguodala is also making the most of his off-court pursuits. He was an early investor in Zoom, the platform he used to conduct the interview for this article. He joined Comcast Ventures’ Catalyst Fund as a venture partner.


  His goal is to continue educating, creating access for and investing in minorities and marginalized communities. In other words, backing up the message he wore on the back of his jersey.


  “Professional athletes have too much down time,” Iguodala said. “That’s how they get in trouble. What I’ve been able to do is take that time and find something that’s purposeful and it’s a passion, something I really enjoy, and not just monetize it, but also help bring my cohorts into the space with me and help them learn as well.”


  Iguodala and Stephen Curry teamed with Bloomberg LP in 2017 to create the annual Players Technology Summit, a forum to link athletes with executives in technology and venture capitalism.


  “People don’t realize the potential athletes have to learn, given the fact that they’ve been professionals in this one discipline for such a long time, from basically childhood,” said Rudy-Cline Thomas, the founder of the venture capital firm Mastry and Iguodala’s longtime business partner. “The potential for learning something outside of that is extremely high.”


  As Iguodala’s basketball career winds down — “sooner rather than later,” he’ll be able to focus on other things, he said — he wants to make sure other players recognize their value on and off the court.


  “We always talk about player health physically and mentally, but ultimately, that No. 1 agenda is the dollars and how much can we bring in,” Iguodala said.

At the onset of the pandemic, warnings of startup doom abounded. Those largely faded after the initial shock of the coronavirus wore off. Now, as the new reality of remote work, school, shopping and socializing supercharges the adoption of tech products and services, sentiment has flipped even further — to a frenzy of deal-making.


  Startups like Discord and Robinhood are raising more money at sky-high valuations and then getting inundated with new funding offers. Venture capitalists are fighting to get into deals. And as delivery service DoorDash and home rental startup Airbnb prepare to go public this week, the bonanza of initial public offerings is likely to enrich and fuel Silicon Valley’s startup boom even more.


  “Almost every hot company right now is being pursued like mad,” said Matt Murphy, an investor at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. “More than ever, there is this flight to being in the assets at any price.”


  The boom is not just being driven by higher demand for digital products and services. Low interest rates are pushing investors to seek returns in ever- riskier assets. Venture firms have raised record levels of capital. A soaring stock market has enabled more IPOs. Big tech companies are making bold acquisitions. Even Bitcoin has reached a new high.


  That helped startups amass $36.5 billion in funding in the third quarter, up 30% from a year earlier, according to CB Insights, which tracks private financing. Startups have raised 223 “mega-rounds” of $100 million or higher so far this year, on pace to surpass last year’s total, according to Pitchbook.


  The average valuations for more mature startups also spiked to a high of $584 million, according to Pitchbook. And 81 IPOs raised $28.5 billion in the third quarter, the busiest period for listings since 2000, according to Renaissance Capital.


  “I haven’t seen anything like this in over 20 years,” said Eric Paley, an investor at venture firm Founder Collective. “The party is as loud, and the drinks are flowing as freely as the dot-com boom, despite that we’re all drinking at home and alone.”


  While some startups have retrenched in the pandemic, far more have found themselves on the right side of the economy’s “feast or famine” split. With the coronavirus compressing years of tech adoption into a few months, lesser- known software companies focused on areas like cloud computing, financial technology and collaboration tools have thrived. Wall Street recently offered warm welcomes to public listings from fast-growing software startups such as Snowflake, Asana, JFrog, Sumo Logic and Unity.

I don't think this would have been possible without the pandemic, honestly. Even though it's horrible, there are always some silver linings to everything.

SIP also invested $20 million in OhmConnect as the largest investor in a Series C raise, which included previous investors as well as Elemental Excelerator. That equity investment supports the company's technological investment and expansion into global markets like Canada and Australia.


  ## Home energy modulation as energy infrastructure


  The new model pledges to actualize some of the lofty visions of an electricity network heading toward a more decentralized and digitized state. Rather than build a new gas peaker plant to fire up and meet shortfalls in demand, OhmConnect wants to eliminate the need for 550 megawatts of generation by toggling consumer devices like air-conditioning, refrigerators and the like. Instead of millions of dollars to build a rarely used plant, expanding Resi-Station requires dependable software and a population of participants who trust OhmConnect with some of their devices.


  OhmConnect has been dispatching demand reductions for several years now, and its performance helped persuade the California Public Utilities Commission to approve the company as a non-generating participant in the CAISO power market. OhmConnect takes the revenue from its utility contracts and market participation and financially rewards the people who respond to calls to reduce usage.


  Companies like Sunrun have pioneered a similar concept, linking up homes with solar and batteries into a "virtual power plant" that can respond to grid capacity needs. Batteries yield significantly more controllable capacity, but require more upfront capital investment. The demand response format is open to renters and people who lack the budget or credit score to go solar; 40 percent of OhmConnect participants are low and moderate income, DeVries noted.


  Still, the need to pay out of pocket for controllable thermostats, for instance, limited the extent to which people could participate in the network. The SIP funding eliminates that barrier, and gives OhmConnect the ability to build out its network in advance of snagging contracts for all that capacity.


  "We could grow and we'd wait for the revenue to catch up and we'd grow again," DeVries said. "We needed to be able to grow faster than the revenue."


  The urgency is driven by the desire to minimize the burning of planet-warming fossil fuels, but also by California's recent brush with power shortages, during the record heat wave in August. A few hundred megawatts of capacity made the difference between a functional grid and rolling blackouts. The CPUC recently launched a proceeding to consider emergency procurements to avoid a repeat next summer, but the timeline for approval seems to preclude traditional infrastructure investments. Developers will only have a couple of months to get new resources up and running.

Now, Dell hasn't held back in kitting the XPS 13 with top-shelf internals…at this price, it would be downright criminal! The model I had in for review had a Core i7- 1065G7 Ice Lake (10th Generation) processor, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. The keen eye amongst you will note that this chip is a step down in terms of pure computational power, but the Ice Lake chips are better suited for graphics intensive tasks like gaming, video and photo editing and the like, thanks to the Iris Plus integrated graphics. You'll notice the difference when you're editing images or playing games, and the performance with the built-in graphics is comparable to a low-end dedicated graphics card. This is not a dedicated gaming machine by any standards, but there's plenty of power on tap for most light gaming and any amount of serious creative work. Daily tasks like dozens of Chrome tabs, music streaming and watching 4K HDR video, expectedly, were a breeze. Demanding tasks do occasionally see the XPS 13 warm up a bit before the fans kick in to keep things cool.

Gross and his partner, former professional tennis player Amy Schwartz, installed the 22-foot-long statue last year. The piece features cobalt-colored reeds stretching nearly 10 feet in height, swimming marlin and globes inspired by traditional blown-glass Japanese fishing floats.


  In a trial that has been held on and off since last month, Towfiq has testified that he had no issues with the lawn sculpture by blown-glass artist Dale Chihuly. However, he testified that he was annoyed when a protective netting went up this year and rarely, if ever, came down. That prompted him to lodge a complaint with the city of Laguna Beach, which sent Gross a letter saying the sculpture and netting lacked permits.


  Towfiq has testified that the letter to the city appeared to set off Gross, who proceeded to harass him by playing loud music at all hours, including and especially the theme song to the classic TV show “Gilligan’s Island.”


  Attorneys for Towfiq are still putting on their case in Orange County Superior Court and have called on Laguna Beach police, who responded to complaints of the loud music, to testify. Attorneys for Gross, meanwhile, on cross-examination, have attempted to paint Towfiq as a peeping Tom, pointing out cameras he has installed at his home and iPhone recordings he made of Gross, Schwartz and the music.
