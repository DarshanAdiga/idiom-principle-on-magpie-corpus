With ‘the power of choice’ in mind, I hit the road in the iX3 to see what this 286 horsepower ‘Sport Activity Vehicle’ with a claimed WLTP range of 460 kilometres felt like. I tried to be sensible and drive in a fashion I imagine a buyer of such a car would, but as with all electric cars, I immediately engaged sport mode and floored it. The instant torque was amusing, the way that 2.2 tonnes shifted was impressive and the accompanying, configurable ‘drive sound’ added some character. 0-100km/h is dispatched in a respectable 6.8 seconds with the top speed capped at 180.

The couple is among hundreds across the United States who are suing the State Department to get processing of K-1 visas, or visas for foreign born fiancés moving again. The lawsuit argues that after a complete shutdown of visa processing at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the State Department and U.S. Embassies around the world did not resume processing K-1 visas when operations came back on line, thus leaving hundreds of couples in limbo.


  “Our immigration process has been an emotional roller coaster, and so you have lots of hope and then crushing disappointment. I think we’re tempering our enthusiasm, because we don’t have to set ourselves up to be disappointed again,” Toole explained.


  When Pedani’s visa ran out in the spring, the couple could have eloped in order to keep him in the country. Instead, they made the choice to follow the law, Pedani would return to Italy, and they would wait for the K-1 visa to come through.


  “I want always to do the right thing,” Pedani told CBS4.

South African veteran Morne Morkel and English batsman Sam Billings have signed up for this summer's Big Bash League, joining Brisbane Heat and Sydney Thunder respectively.
 Morkel's signature is a recruiting coup for the Heat as he is joining as a local player and will be available for the entire season.
 The towering paceman, who retired from international cricket in 2018 after representing the Proteas in 247 matches, lives in Sydney with Australian wife Roz Kelly.
 Morkel played one game for the Perth Scorchers during 2019-20 as an international player but has since gained permanent residency.
 "I admit it will be a bit unusual to call myself a local, but we are enjoying living and working here and this is another aspect of our lives that I am looking forward to," the 36-year-old Morkel said.
 The Heat have already signed Afghanistan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman plus England's Tom Banton and Lewis Gregory as their internationals.
 Banton and Gregory and will miss the early stages of the BBL because they are taking part in England's white-ball tour of South Africa.
 It means Brisbane could sign two more foreign players for that window - although convincing potential recruits to spent a fortnight in hotel quarantine for such a short stint could be a tough sell.
 "We've got a few things in motion and will stay close with Tom and Lewis to map out the best plan for them to get here and perform at their best," Heat coach Darren Lehman said.
 Meanwhile, Billings has joined compatriots Banton, Gregory, Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Liam Livingstone, Dawid Malan, Tom Curran and James Vince in opting for a BBL stint.
 Jonny Bairstow has been linked to Melbourne Stars.
 Billings scored a career-best 118 during Australia's recent ODI tour of England, including a towering six off Mitchell Starc that deposited the ball deep into Old Trafford's car park.
 "Coming to the Big Bash after (batting consistently) against Australia's finest is a big confidence booster," former Sydney Sixers player Billings said.
 "It was something I was very proud of, and it's definitely one of my best summers of cricket.
 "I'm very happy to be on board with Sydney Thunder ... Jos (Buttler) and Joe Root are two good mates of mine who represented Thunder, so I picked their brains.
 "Neither had a bad word . . . all they could tell me was it's a great franchise and wonderful to be a part of."

The Postal Service has since disputed that 300,000 ballots figure, adding that it was unlikely so many ballots could have been misplaced, The Washington Post reported. Officials also said some pieces of mail set aside for expedited delivery weren't scanned.
 "In no uncertain terms, I'm not pleased about the 11th-hour development last night," Sullivan said during a hearing Wednesday, according to Buzzfeed. "You can tell your clients that -- and someone might have a price to pay. If it was not possible as a practical matter for my order to be compiled with, it was the government's job to tell me that so I could make appropriate adjustments to the order."
 In addition to the nationwide sweep, Sullivan ordered the Postal Service to submit data about the election mail received at its processing centers -- including the processing scores of inbound and outbound ballots at each of its facilities.
 According to the data provided, the Greensboro facility processed 72.55% of the more than 6,000 ballots it received on Election Day. The Mid-Carolina district reportedly processed 79.48% of the roughly 3,500 ballots it received that day.
 Nationally, the Postal Service processed about 93% of ballots on Election Day, meaning "nearly 7% of ballots in U.S. Postal Service sorting facilities on Tuesday were not processed on time for submission to election officials," The Washington Post reported.
 Voting experts say the timely processing rate should be at least 97% to meet expected goals, according to the Post.
 "We know yesterday that if the sweeps were doing their job, mail that was identified as ballots and were in the system should have been pulled out and delivered, and it may be that affects what we see as the scores," Allison Zieve, an attorney representing one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit told the Post on Wednesday. "The problem is, in part because of the timing and in part because they haven't given us all the information we asked for, it's hard to know whether the numbers we saw today -- the low scores for example in Atlanta and Central Pennsylvania -- it's hard to assess how big a problem that is."
 The Postal Service also responded Thursday to reports that four days of mail- in ballots were sitting on a loading dock in its Greensboro facility, a reporter for Courthouse News Service said on Twitter. Officials said no such ballots were found.
 "Defendants further confirm that on November 4, 2020, the Greensboro Plant manager walked the facility and did not locate any boxes of ballots," the Postal Service said in a notice to the court on Thursday.

AVONDALE, Ariz. — Kevin Harvick was a sure bet to make the NASCAR finale and likely close out one of the most dominant seasons of the decade.


  Instead, he's been eliminated and the hyped head-to-head matchup between Harvick and Denny Hamlin has been scrapped. For better or worse, NASCAR's title-deciding format knocked the strongest team this season from contention for Sunday's winner-take-all final four at Phoenix Raceway.


  “I’m not going to view if we win it any different whether he was in or out,” Hamlin said Thursday.


  No one denies Harvick deserved a chance at the title. He won a series-high nine times, had a whopping 20 top-five finishes and led nearly every statistical category this year. It was a back-and-forth between Harvick and Hamlin that most assumed would go down to the finale.


  But Harvick had a poor third round of the playoffs and his season collapsed. He's out of the way and Hamlin will race Chase Elliott, Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano for the Cup Series championship.


  It's a much cleaner path to the title since Harvick is a nine-time winner at Phoenix, which is hosting NASCAR's championship weekend for the first time.


  Out of the mix for the title, he might still be in contention for the race win.


  “They’ve got a chip on the shoulder and if they’ve got a fast car, they are going to give the guys in the championship a whole lot of trouble,” said NBC Sports analyst Dale Earnhardt Jr. “I think Harvick might hustle up in there and just not care.”


  Hamlin, a seven-race winner this season, believes the champion has to win Sunday. But he also knows Harvick has nothing to lose.


  “I still think I’m going to have to race him,” Hamlin said. “I would think they probably come loaded and ready to go out and show that they should be champions, right? I don’t expect him to waffle around and just kind of let all four of us go race for it.”


  Hamlin has had conversations with Harvick and some of his Stewart-Haas Racing crew since Harvick's dramatic elimination. Hamlin appreciates the season his rival has put together in the pandemic-altered season, when there was no practice or qualifying, and Harvick and crew were good every week with the car brought straight from the shop.


  Harvick was so focused on winning a second Cup title that he homeschooled his 8-year-old to minimize health risks. The No. 4 team was locked in on the championship and everyone expected them at Phoenix.


  “In my mind he was deserving of racing for a championship, but didn’t earn it because of the system,” Hamlin said. “I understand their pain."


  There's a balance, though, in commiserating with Harvick and exulting over the opportunity ahead. Keselowski won a series-high six races in 2014 but didn't make it to the final four that season, the year Harvick won his only title.


  Now Keselowski is in the championship round with a chance at his own second crown.


  “It’s a helpless feeling. It’s a frustrating feeling. But it’s what the format is,” Keselowski said. “I do feel those sympathies for him. In a selfish way, I’m glad that I won’t have to compete against him.”


  Logano raced his way into the finale as the only playoff driver with a third- round victory. Since clinching his berth three weeks ago, his Team Penske crew has been focused on a plan for Phoenix and doesn't much care about Harvick's fate.


  “I honestly as a competitor don’t have many feelings for others,” Logano said. “When I’m competing, it’s about my team.”


  Elliott, racing in the final four for the first time in his career, has somewhat shielded himself from the dramatics of the season and focused only on his Hendrick Motorsports effort. He's taken a break from social media over the closing months of the season and didn't focus on Harvick's season.


  “For us to sit here and talk about others, or the other three guys in it, or who’s not in it, who somebody thinks the favourite is or isn’t, is just very unproductive in my eyes,” Elliott said. “I’m just really thinking about us, being selfish in a lot of ways this week, trying to put emphasis on the things that are going to make us go fast. Me ranking Kevin’s season is not one of them.”

Perhaps the people who thought this was a good idea need a bit of a history lesson. One person they should learn about is Rosa Parks. She was the courageous black woman who famously refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama on Dec 1, 1955. It was her arrest that sparked the civil rights movement that ended once and for all the Jim Crow laws that had officially made black Americans second class citizens. Ms. Parks, Martin Luther King (MLK) and other civil rights giants insisted that blacks be allowed to ride on the same buses, drink at the same water fountains, and participate as equals. And they succeeded.

Arsenal have made it three wins from three in the Europa League this term, putting Molde to the sword in the 4-1 defeat.


  The Gunners didn’t start the fixture comfortably, and our opponents used their composure to get a lead inside the opening 30 minutes, but that goal did wake the team up.


  The last 15 minutes was all Arsenal, and before we could even be angry about the officials decision to disallow our perfectly good goal, we had the ball in the net again.


  Joe Willock’s penetrating run forced our rivals to flap, shortly before the break, and at 1-1 at half-time we would have been feeling confident in the way we ended the period.


  We started the next half much of the same, as we piled pressure on with some neat work on and off the ball, and once we managed to secure the lead thanks to another own goal, we really began to turn the screw.


  Nicolas Pepe capped off a fine performance with a neatly placed goal to put us two goals clear, with substitution Saka, who came on to pile more punishment on Molde, setting up the Ivory Coast international.


  Joe Willock was also amongst our better players on the night, and he also managed to cap his display off with a late goal, closing the game off at 4-1.


  Pepe and Willock will deserve considering for more regular minutes if they can carry on their form, while the latter could well pose as the answer to our creative issues in midfield this term.


  Will the manager already be looking at the young midfielder for some Premier League minutes? Do we have to take these Thursday night performances with a pinch of salt because of the opposition?

A second page reiterates the call for emergency medical services.


  No response.


  A third call finally reaches an emergency medical technician (EMT) who heads to the scene.


  The scenario repeats itself more frequently lately in Jackson County as the number of volunteer EMS personnel dwindles.


  Volunteer EMS services such as Bellevue EMS and Preston-Miles Community Ambulance acutely feel the pinch. Bellevue lost four life members (those with 10 or more years of service) this year, depleting their numbers to 22; two trainees also dropped out. Community Ambulance lost five EMTs and one ambulance driver is restricted, dropping their volunteer pool to 16 local individuals.


  The shortage of volunteer EMTs is not singular to Jackson County, according to Ryan Conley, the county’s emergency medical services coordinator who will teach an EMT course here beginning Dec. 4.


  The United States lost more than 132,000 EMS providers in 2015-19


  Between 2005 and 2015, Iowa lost 110 ambulance systems. “While 12% is not a huge number, what if you’re one of those 110 areas without an agency?” Conley asked.


  The shortage proves especially detrimental to rural communities, Conley said, because local volunteers typically are among the first on the scene.


  “That three-minute response time for volunteers to arrive is vital to the family, to provide care for the patient and the family, to give them peace of mind while waiting for transport,” he said.


  Without local volunteer services, communities would rely on paid outlying transport services that could more than triple response times, Conley explained.


  Why the shortage?


  EMS services changed tremendously over the last 50 years. For example, prior to the formation of the Bellevue EMS in 1972, Gallagher Funeral Home cared for and transported patients. The funeral home quit when under stricter state requirements, forcing Bellevue residents to go without EMS services or form their own.


  Max Reed is a charter member of Bellevue EMS and continues to volunteer 48 years later. The agency boasted 46 members then, reached a peak of 55 in 1981, and declined to today’s total of 22.


  Greg Schulte, a Bellevue EMS volunteer and firefighter, joined the service more than 30 years ago. He knew the service had problems responding to calls during the day, he had the training and a flexible work schedule, so he joined.


  Registered nurse Vicki Johnson joined Preston-Miles Community Ambulance service to help the community with emergency medical coverage. At that time, nurses had to complete the same training as a lay person, so she qualified. She’s a training officer for the service schedules EMS volunteers to cover the service.


  That’s becoming increasingly difficult with the shortage of volunteer EMTs. The service lost five active members.


  “The loss has hit us pretty hard,” Johnson said, noting that Community Ambulance also has several members nearing retirement age who will retire soon.


  Community Ambulance once had enough trained people to staff it 24/7. Two years ago, it decreased hours on call to only 24 hours a day on the weekend and only nights during the week.


  The lack of free time is huge in recruiting volunteers, Johnson said.


  “All these people on our service have full time jobs and families that we try to work the on-call time around,” Johnson said. “… There are concerns about your own safety with COVID now. Getting up in the middle of the night is not pleasant especially when you work the next day. It's putting one more thing into an already busy day.”


  The education commitment also deters prospective volunteers.


  “You have to convince someone to sit through the course,” Conley said. Locally, it’s four hours twice a week for four months. “Basically, for every hour you put in in class you should be studying at least that long between classes.”


  Also, there is no adequate way to estimate how much volunteer time is spent responding to calls. EMTs can expect to spend, on average, two hours per call by the time they care for the patient and complete paperwork.


  For example, Bellevue EMS responded to 327 medical calls last year. That number has decreased compared to the same time last year, according to EMT Derek Ploeger.


  But there is no way to know how many calls there will be at any given time.


  “It’s a big commitment,” Reed said.


  “And it’s a commitment for their family, not just the (EMT),” Schulte added, noting the numerous suppers and other events where he had to leave early because the pager signaled an emergency call.


  It cost Reed a car, he teased, because on his 40th anniversary with Bellevue EMS, he bought his wife a Corvette to replace all the meals and events he missed while out on calls.


  “You have to be flexible,” Reed said.


  How they operate


  Each EMS service operates a bit differently. In Bellevue, volunteers sign up for on-call shifts from 6 p.m. to 4 a.m. They generally work with the same two- or three-person crew which usually consists of at least two certified EMTs and occasionally a paramedic. The schedule repeats every eight days.


  Outside of those hours, EMS works as an “open page” for all EMS members. This means whomever is available should respond to an emergency call, Ploeger explained.


  Bellevue utilizes the IamResponding app on their cell phones and in the ambulance bay that allows members to keep track of who is responding and where they are.


  Bellevue EMS also allows prospective EMTs to go on for “on the ground training,” Reed said. They go out with an experienced crew and keep track of name, time, medical history, vitals, etc.


  The requirements


  “You don’t just walk in and say, ‘I’m going to be an EMT,’” Schulte said. “It’s not all lights and sirens.”


  Be prepared for rigorous work and studying to become an EMT.


  “It’s going to be a rigorous course because you’re going to be caring for people,” Conley said.

The Company is currently exploring various workout strategies and believes there is a reasonable likelihood that the majority of the principal and missed interest payments will be recovered, although there is no assurance.

Five LGBTQ+ Politicians Make History On Election Day
   *[FT]: Financial Times


--DocBreak--
Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen spent Tuesday night at her election watch party in Dallas, Texas. By Thursday, she was back on Clemson University's campus to teach her in-person class.


   


  In addition to being the first female Libertarian nominee for president, Jorgensen, 63, is a psychology lecturer who has juggled teaching with running a campaign since her nomination this summer.


   


  Pulling votes from Biden, Trump


   


  And while the White House is impossible for the third-party candidate -- she's on pace to get 1.1% of the national vote, according to the latest results -- Jorgensen and the Libertarians pulled thousands of crucial votes away from Democrat and Republican candidates in several battleground states.


   


  The Greenville resident spoke to The News on Wednesday just minutes after Wisconsin had been called for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden by the Associated Press.


   


  Jorgensen, who ran alongside Myrtle Beach resident Spike Cohen, earned 38,414 votes in Wisconsin, according to the AP.


   


  President Donald Trump lost the state by 20,000 votes.


   


  The scenario replayed itself in Michigan and Nevada, where Biden pulled ahead by tens of thousands of votes  Wednesday.


   


  In each state, Jorgensen earned enough of the votes to cost Trump the race, according to the latest AP tallies, and overall, the longtime Greenville resident earned the second-most votes of any Libertarian nominee ever with at least 1.6 million votes, according to the AP.


   


  And yet, even some of her students may not know Jorgensen is even on the ballot.


   


  "Unlike many liberal professors who talk about their politics in class, I think it's egregious for me to take time that tuition is being spent on to talk about my pet politics. I have never once mentioned to my students in class or outside of class, 'Hey, I'm running for president'," she said


   


  Tuesday night should be a wake-up call


   


  Jorgensen said third-party voters aren't to blame for a Republican loss. Republicans are.


   


  "They should be mad at those candidates for not following through on their campaign promises," she said.


   


  Jorgensen has been campaigning across the country since the summer and said many supporters have come from across party lines -- mainly, "recovering Democrats" who want troops called home from overseas missions and Republicans upset that Trump failed to cut the national budget deficit as he promised during his 2016 campaign, she said.


   


  The major parties' close race this election should be a wake-up call, Jorgensen added.


   


  "If I can get Republicans to start acting like Republicans and cutting the deficit. And if I can get the Democrats to go back to being the party of peace, bringing our troops home, and giving the average individual their rights? Then yes, I would be very pleased."


   


  About 70% of Jorgensen's campaign volunteers were registered Democrats or Republicans, she said.


   


  "In the personal conversations I had (on the campaign trail) a lot of people would say, 'yeah, in 2016 I voted for Trump. I was so excited and then he didn't follow through on his promises,'" she said.


   


  Jorgensen performed the best in rural, western states. She secured 2.6% of the vote in Alaska and North Dakota and 2.7% of the vote in South Dakota, according to the AP.


   


  In her home state, she did not fare as well. But, Jorgensen wasn't really paying attention to her performance in South Carolina.


   


  "You know, I haven't even checked it yet," she said of her voter spread in SC Wednesday afternoon.


   


  Jorgensen will return to the Upstate, where she lives and works, but hopes to continue "spreading the message" of the Libertarian party after the election is over.


   


  But first, "I teach a class tomorrow."

Light treatment with both cold and warm LEDs had a similar impact on the gametogenesis cycle.”

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Two years after Missouri voters enacted a first-of-its-kind initiative intended to create “partisan fairness” in voting districts, they have changed their minds. Before the measure could be used, voters reversed key parts of it in Tuesday’s election. They opted instead to return to a method that will let commissions composed of Democratic and Republican loyalists redraw state legislative districts after census results are released. The Missouri vote broke a string of nationwide electoral victories for redistricting reform advocates and opened the potential for Missouri to experiment with another nationally unique model — one that could exclude noncitizens from the population totals used in redistricting. Some supporters of the 2018 initiative, known as Clean Missouri, asserted that voters were tricked into undercutting it by the Republican-led Legislature, which placed Amendment 3 on this year's ballot. The amendment passed with just 51% of the vote. “I’m not sure that voters fully understood that they were in fact repealing what they had passed in 2018 rather than building on it,” said Yurij Rudensky, a redistricting attorney at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. By contrast, some Republican lawmakers contend that voters were misled by the original measure. “I don’t think there’s a problem with letting voters reconsider it,” said Republican state Sen. Dan Hegeman, who sponsored this year's measure.

Meanwhile, bolstered by their presumption of victory, the Bush team showed little compunction about using every legal tool and argument at its disposal, even if it contradicted itself. The Republicans argued that the election was over once the votes were counted on Election Day — except when it came to a thousand or so contested overseas ballots from members of the military that filtered in long afterward, which the Gore campaign suspected had been sent after the election. (There were unsubstantiated rumors that a notorious South Carolina political operative was running an overseas harvesting operation for Bush.) The Bush team argued that the ballots should be processed by machines, not subjective human beings — except in the case of a disputed cache of absentee ballots from Republican strongholds, which had been fiddled with by party workers who corrected innocent mistakes that made them invalid. (A young Amy Coney Barrett worked on the Republican side of that lawsuit.)

“My phone’s been ringing off the hook,” Wood said Thursday. “You can’t operate with those costs. The political climate in Washington is far less favorable to agriculture than the natural climate.”


  The court majority found the Legislature had no reasonable basis for excluding agriculture workers from the protections. The justices said agriculture work generally is dangerous, with workers exposed to diseases from animals, physical strain, and pesticides and other chemicals that can increase risk of neurological conditions and cancer. In 2015, the injury rate for Washington’s dairy industry was nearly one-fifth higher than that of the agricultural sector.


  In a concurring opinion, Justice Steven González also noted what he described as the racist origins of the overtime exemption for farmworkers. In the South, a feudal-like state replaced slavery, with Black workers continuing to toil on white-owned farms. When federal lawmakers passed major labor reforms in the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made compromises to win the support of Southern Democrats, exempting farmworkers from such protections and preserving the racial hierarchy.


  Many states, including Washington, subsequently based their labor laws on the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

SAO PAULO, Nov 5 (Reu ters) - The northern Brazilian state of Amapá has been virtually without electricity since a blackout on Tuesday night and is receiving only 10% of its normal power supply, the national grid operator ONS said on Thursday.


  Authorities are working round the clock to replace transformers that were knocked out by a fire at the main power station in the capital city of Macapá, where most of the state's 862,000 inhabitants live.


  Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque, speaking to reporters in Brasilia, said the government was sending transformers to Amapá to try to restore 60% of the power supply to the state, but replacing them all would take a month.


  Only a small local hydroelectric plant that does not rely on the transformer station is currently operating.

The Pleasant Valley football program has a long history of playing great defense.
 However, the past two years weren’t quite so great and on paper, it didn’t really look as though that was likely to change this season.
 The Spartans returned just two defensive starters and only one of their top nine tacklers — inside linebacker Michael Acri — from a 4-5 team.
 But head coach Rusty VanWetzinga knew what we all know now: Looks can be deceiving.

  “We can’t take a day off,” Ehlinger said. “We don’t have the luxury of being undefeated in Big 12 play. We have no choice and every game is a big game from here on out.”


  Like Texas, West Virginia has been hot and cold at times and will be challenged to give an overall effort similar to last week when it beat Kansas State at home. The offense has finally gotten a number of big plays to approach that of its defense.

Our tax dollars run out, the job will be gone. But what a business creates won't.

They began the season with back-to-back losses.


   


  They had to deal with numerous issues, from injuries to COVID-19. They also had to play all season with the proverbial bulls-eye on their back as the defending 4A state champions.


   


  But the Poteau Pirates have persevered, and this week, they can enter the postseason on a long winning streak and become outright District 4A-4 champs.


   


  Poteau reeled off its seventh straight win last Friday, as the Pirates downed Fort Gibson, 28-6, at Costner Stadium.


   


  In that win, the Pirates had 312 yards of total offense, all coming on the ground. Jagger Dill rushed for 122 yards on eight carries, while quarterback Colton Williamson had 58 yards on nine rushes with a TD.


   


  Todd Mattox had two rushing TDs as well for Poteau.


   


  During the Pirates' current seven-game winning streak, they have averaged 312.9 yards rushing. That includes a high of 409 achieved against Stilwell.


   


  Fort Gibson ran more plays than Poteau, 63-58, but the Pirates' defense held the Tigers to 200 yards and 11 first downs. Fort Gibson was able to avoid being shutout with a touchdown on the game's final play.


   


  Poteau linebacker Dean Odom registered 23 total tackles, 16 of those solo stops, along with two tackles for loss. Fellow linebacker Jake Patterson added two tackles for loss and a sack.


   


  The Pirates (7-2, 6-0) can claim the outright 4A-4 title this Friday with a win at Broken Bow.


   


  Both Broken Bow and Hilldale are tied for second place, a game back of Poteau at 5-1. Hilldale will play Fort Gibson on Friday.


   


  If Poteau does win Friday, the Pirates will achieve another first, being the first squad in program history to win three straight district championships.


   


  Sallisaw


   


  The Black Diamonds fell short last week at Broken Bow, 14-12, when the Savages knocked down a desperation pass in the end zone on the final play.


   


  Sallisaw (3-4, 3-3 4A-4) can still finish in the upper half of the district standings. The Diamonds return home this week to take on Stilwell, and a win along with a Fort Gibson loss to Hilldale would give Sallisaw fourth place.


   


  Even if Fort Gibson wins, Sallisaw can still get the No. 4 playoff seed with a win by virtue of its head-to-head win against the Tigers.


   


  Stigler


   


  One of the state's biggest games takes place Friday in Stigler, which will be a match-up between undefeated squads.


   


  The 9-0 Panthers will face 8-0 Lincoln Christian in a game that will also decide the 3A-3 championship. Lincoln Christian is also ranked No. 1 in 3A in this week's Associated Press poll, with Stigler coming in at No. 4.


   


  On the season, Lincoln Christian is averaging 51.9 points per game, with the Panthers averaging 44.2. Lincoln is also averaging at least 200 yards both rushing and passing, while the Panthers have averaged 251.7 yards on the ground and 188.4 yards through the air.


   


  Stigler set up the big showdown with a 35-0 win last week at Westville. Quarterback Darren Manes rushed for two TDs, while fellow quarterback Zane Oldham passed for 72 yards and a TD, which went to Grayson Gilmore.


   


  Roland


   


  The Rangers had a scheduled game last week against Cascia Hall canceled.


   


  This Friday, they return to action at home against Panama. With a win, Roland (5-3, 3-2 2A-5) would finish in the upper half of the district standings.


   


  Spiro


   


  For the second straight week, Spiro won't be in action.


   


  The Bulldogs' scheduled game Friday against Pocola was canceled due to issues related to COVID-19. Last week, Spiro's big showdown at Vian was canceled for the same reason.


   


  Spiro stands at 6-1 overall and 4-1 in 2A-5. Currently, the Bulldogs share second place with Vian, which wraps up the regular season on Thursday with a game at Heavener.


   


  Arkoma


   


  The Mustangs had a rescheduled game on Monday as they rolled past Cave Springs, 60-0. Arkoma had 22 points in the first quarter and 38 more in the second quarter as the game was stopped at halftime.


   


  Quarterback Easton Smith completed 5-of-6 passes for 107 yards and a TD.


   


  The Mustangs also tallied 297 yards rushing, led by 102 yards from Alex McLemore, who had a TD. Grant Williams had three rushing TDs as well, while freshman Demetrio Boyd had 80 yards both rushing and receiving, as well as a TD in each category.


   


  On defense, Brett Chambers had 10 tackles, a fumble recovery and an interception which he returned 42 yards for a TD.


   


  Arkoma (5-2, 1-1 B-6) will wrap up the regular season at home Friday against Keota.


   


  Central


   


  Behind a big night rushing from David Briggs, the Tigers downed Canadian, 47-6, in a game played on Monday night.


   


  Briggs scored five touchdowns as he rushed for 196 yards on 16 carries. Toby Barrett added 79 yards on nine carries and a TD as well for the Tigers.


   


  Central improved to 4-5 overall and 3-3 in A-8 with the win. The Tigers could finish as high as third place in the district with a win Friday at Hulbert.

Oklahoma is on a three-game win streak and is within a game of Big 12 leaders Iowa State and Kansas State. The Sooners have won five straight Big 12 titles and likely can’t lose again if they want to reach the conference title game. The Sooners have won 21 straight November games dating to 2014, and coach Lincoln Riley is 12-0 in November as Oklahoma’s head coach. Kansas has lost all of its games by at least 15 points this season and looks to be more competitive.


  KEY MATCHUP


  Oklahoma’s running game vs. Kansas’ run defense. Oklahoma rushed for a season-high 213 yards on just 39 carries in last Saturday’s win over Texas Tech — the third straight solid rushing performance by the Sooners. Kansas has the Big 12’s worst run defense, allowing 222 yards per game on the ground in league play. If the Sooners get ahead early, they could punish the Jayhawks on the ground.

We’re on the same page-hunters and landowners. Sometimes we work together. And this is all part of respecting each other.”      “This was an awesome team effort,” summarized Incident Commander Foley. “It worked out really well, collaborating with the locals to get ‘er done and get this individual home.

CONYERS — The Rockdale County Board of Commissioners heard several citizens voice objections to the proposed 2021 general fund budget of $79,857,211 at a public hearing on Nov. 3. The proposed budget is an increase of $4,474,310 over the current budget of $75,382 901.


  In a press release, the BOC stated the county was able to deliver a balanced budget, or a budget that does not borrow from the county’s fund balance, and remain in decent financial strength in light of the COVID-19 pandemic


  “In the midst of the pandemic to still be able to deliver a conservative budget is credit to our ‘all hands on deck’ approach,'” Chairman Oz Nesbitt Sr. said. “This was truly a group effort between the office of the chairman, the board of directors, and executive staff. The BOC listened to the citizens as it related to the millage rate and the board has responded accordingly by delivering a conservative budget.”

One of the company’s biggest talking points in the lead-up to the Series X and S has been a feature called Smart Delivery: a service that, should a game be available for both Xboxes new and old, would automatically provide you with the version suited for whatever console you had, and upgrade for free should you decide to move from the Xbox One to the Xbox Series S or X. It’s a very consumer-friendly move — in previous console release cycles, if you had a game on, say, the PlayStation 2, and there was a PlayStation 3 version, you just had to buy it twice if you wanted to see what the newer console could do.

An unfortunate set of circumstances plagued Ligonier native Garrett Smithley in Martinsville, Virginia, last Sunday in the NASCAR Cup’s penultimate event for the 2020 season.


  “We started 40th (because of a driver change not on original entry list), had a good start initially, passed a bunch of cars on the outside,” Smithley said. “We passed the No. 17 straight up on speed, and with about 20-laps into the race, the motor started to stumble.”


  Smithley was unable to continue because the motor failed. He was forced to stop on the track because he couldn’t exit to pit lane.


  “We still aren’t sure what caused the motor to stop,” Smithley said. “It may have been the alternator, or something electrical, maybe the ignition.


  “It’s just disappointing. We had a really good handling race car and for some reason, the crew and I jell together well at Phoenix. If you look at the raw- speed lap times, we were the quickest car in our group by far, and that’s something you can hang your hat on.”


  For a new sponsor, having mechanical issues and not finishing the race is tough on everyone, mostly when the driver wasn’t at fault.


  “It’s one of those things that sometimes happens in racing,” Smithley said. “It’s disappointing, but at the same time, you have to put everything into perspective.”


  Working with multiple crew chiefs and crews is something Smithley seems to have under control. Smithley has driven five different NASCAR Cup cars in 2020 for Rick Ware Racing (RWR) and teams affiliated with RWR for a total of 25 NASCAR Cup races. That’s in addition to four races in the Xfinity Series for RWR and one race in the Gander Outdoors and RV Sales Truck Series.


  Smithley worked with six different and nine different chief chiefs in 2020.


  On Sunday, Smithley will be driving the No. 7 Camaro sponsored by Victory Lane Quick Oil Changes with Tommy Baldwin as the crew chief on the pit box.


  “It’s neat to be part of the championship race in the Cup Series,” Smithley said. “That will be something going to Phoenix and not Homestead as we had in the past. Again, it’s the low downforce package like we ran at Martinsville. I’ll be honest that Phoenix wasn’t my favorite track in the Xfinity Series, but I’ve enjoyed running Phoenix in the Cup Series.”


  “We had a good car in Phoenix last year, and we had a good run there. Earlier this year in Phoenix, unfortunately, we ended up blowing a motor right before the (coronavirus) shut down. I was pretty happy with our car there, and I am pretty optimistic about Phoenix. Again, our goal will be a top-30 run, and I am pleased that Victory Lane will once again be coming on board as our sponsor for the championship race; Phoenix is a big market for them.”


  The NASCAR Cup Series Championship race for the Bill France Cup is set for 3 p.m., Sunday on NBC.

The Brazilian-bred Ivar, an Argentine Grade 1 winner on turf and dirt before being relocated to America, was a good third in Kentucky Downs’ $750,000 Tourist Mile and then captured Keeneland’s Grade 1 Shadwell Turf Mile. He’s the 4-1 favorite in a wide-open running of the $2 million FanDuel Breeders’ Cup Mile on grass. The Tourist Mile is named for the winner of the 2016 Breeders’ Cup Mile the year after he captured the Kentucky Downs stakes, then known as the More Than Ready.


  “I think people are looking more seriously at Kentucky Downs,” said Ivar’s trainer, Paulo Lobo. “Huge purses and I think Grade 2 or Grade 1 status is coming for their races in a couple of years.”


  Unbeaten Plum Ali, whose middle of three victories came in Kentucky Downs’ $500,000 The Mint Juvenile Fillies, is the 4-1 co-second choice in Friday’s $1 million Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf.


  Harvey’s Lil Goil dropped a close decision to Micheline in the $500,000 Exacta Systems Dueling Grounds Oaks but then turned the tables with a victory in Keeneland’s Grade 1 Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup. She’s the only American 3-year-old filly in the field and her morning-line odds are 20-1. But she’s a quality filly on turf and dirt who has no problems with 1 3/16 miles.


  “I don’t feel we’ve got a lot to lose with her,” Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott said. “We’re ready to take on the challenge and see what we’ve got.”


  Bodenheimer — Keeneland’s Indian Summer winner whose only defeat in four starts came over soft turf in Kentucky Downs’ $500,000 Bal a Bali Juvenile Turf Sprint — is a great value play in Friday’s $1 million Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint at 8-1.


  Kentucky Downs also launched a pair of 2-year-olds into the $2 million TVG Breeders’ Cup Juvenile on dirt. That includes Kentucky Downs maiden winner Next, who won a Keeneland allowance race by 11 lengths in his next start. Bon Raison is contesting the $2 million Sprint off of a Keeneland allowance triumph that followed his 10th place in the RUNHAPPY Turf Sprint.


  Six other Breeders’ Cup horses ran at Kentucky Downs’ 2019 meet. Those include leading Turf Sprint contenders Leinster and the mare Oleksandra, both of whom experienced minor but untimely setbacks that kept them from a return to Kentucky Downs. Leinster most recently won Keeneland’s Grade 2 Woodford, while the 6-year-old mare Oleksandra comes in off a 4 1/2-month layoff since beating the boys to take Belmont’s Grade 1 Jaipur.


  Another 2019 Kentucky Downs product is the 3-year-old Art Collector, Keeneland’s Grade 2 Toyota Blue Grass and Ellis Park Derby winner now in the $1 million Big Ass Fans Dirt Mile. Art Collector’s first victory came on the Kentucky Downs’ grass last year.


  "It's the most unique place in America for turf racing," Donegal head Jerry Crawford said of Kentucky Downs. "It's really created a whole new dimension. We don't plan a racing season for a turf horse without looking at the schedule there. That's first-stop shopping for us."

I travelled to Greece to see what the near finished product was like to drive. The platform of the e-tron GT is shared with the Porsche Taycan - no bad thing as praise for the Stuttgart produced EV has been universal. The plan was to land and drive the RS e-tron GT under the darkness of the night, however, the Greek weather Gods had other plans and a storm scuppered the plans. The next morning I rose bright and early to experience the prototype on the tarmac of a disused military base. Being an EV it seemed rude not to put the RS into its sportiest modes and feel the instant torque of the electric motors.

“I don’t think there’s a problem with letting voters reconsider it,” said Republican state Sen. Dan Hegeman, who sponsored this year's measure. He said it returns redistricting to “a tried and true method."


  Missouri's 2018 initiative had been part of a national movement aimed at combating partisan gerrymandering, which occurs when politicians draw voting districts to give themselves or their political parties an advantage in future elections.


  Voters in Colorado, Michigan, Ohio and Utah all passed redistricting overhauls that year. Virginia voters approved a constitutional amendment Tuesday that will shift redistricting power away from its legislature, currently controlled by Democrats, to a bipartisan commission of lawmakers and citizens.


  The original Clean Missouri measure also limited lobbyist gifts and campaign contributions to lawmakers, and made lawmakers' records open to the public. The ballot summary listed all of those things while also noting it changed the “process and criteria for redrawing state legislative districts.” But the ballot summary provided no specifics of how redistricting would change.


  The 2018 measure directed a new nonpartisan demographer to draw state House and Senate districts to achieve “partisan fairness” and "competitiveness" based on the average votes that Republicans and Democrats received in the three previous elections for president, U.S. Senate and governor. It made Missouri the first state to use a specific formula, known as the “efficiency gap," to calculate political fairness.


  An Associated Press analysis determined that the formula likely would have allowed Democrats to cut into Republicans' supermajorities in the Missouri Legislature in the upcoming 2022 elections.

The question of landscape reflects social, economic and cultural issues. The specificity of a neighborhood has an influence on collective identity by having a symbolic resonance. The overall destruction of this type in the center of Yerevan raises the question of these urban landscapes emptied of collective experience and social interaction. Talking about landscape is not just talking about a relationship with nature, it is a global vision obtained from certain points of view. Landscape is inseparable from the subject who perceives it. The constructed or natural landscape is a semiotic notion; it is a figurative whole producing values. It belongs to a territory and not only to a history, this text from 2007 was written after a study trip with art history students, whom I had brought to visit Armenia, to go beyond the simple typological reading of the landscapes they were passing through. To arrive at several levels of axiological apprehension, in particular for a social representation of the landscape. The vision of architecture, for example, and especially of the churches on the Armenian territory is a form of concretization of values of a society, how this society “structures” its beliefs. Architecture and landscape form an obvious whole in Armenia.

But even though some good actions may be happening, worse actions are coming. The Republican National Committee, for the first time in 40 years, is going to be able to engage in paid voter intimidation across the country. Back in 1981, they had something called the Ballot Security Task Force. [These were] off-duty officers who wore armbands and had walkie talkies and sidearms. They went to predominantly Black and Latino voting districts in New Jersey and walked up and down the lines of voters, telling people that they would be monitored if they went inside to vote. These were police officers, so people got out of line. They thought if they voted, they could go to jail. It was so effective that the federal government issued an order against the Republican National Committee, and it lasted until 2017. For 40 years, their behavior was so offensive, the federal government was like, “Nah, y’all ain’t allowed to do this.” But in 2017, the federal court decided that [Republicans] had learned their lesson, and the Republican National Committee, with their hundreds of millions of dollars, could be trusted.

The Vikings have run the ball on 49.6% of their plays, the third-most in the league. Baltimore, the NFL leader, employs a run-heavy quarterback in 2019 NFL MVP Lamar Jackson.
 “We just run yards like Swiss chard,” Cook said, using the leafy green vegetable for a clever rhyme.
 The nutritional value is unmistakable, as long as they're controlling the ball and scoring points. That's the way they tried to win with Cook's predecessor, too. Peterson, coincidentally, will be in Minnesota on Sunday with his latest team, the Detroit Lions.
 The Vikings (2-5) have a lot of catchup to do.
 They blew double-digit second-half leads and lost be one point to Tennessee and Seattle. They were also no-shows in one-sided defeats to Green Bay, Indianapolis and Atlanta. Their performance against Detroit (3-4) will reveal a lot about whether they're truly a darkhorse contender for the expanded playoffs or better off refocusing on the future.
 That summary might sound familiar to the Lions, who were unsure if quarterback Matthew Stafford would be available after placing him this week on the COVID-19 reserve list.
 “We’re doing some things really well,” coach Matt Patricia said. “We just have to learn how to finish better. I think that’s true all the way across the board.”

But they went on to finish a credible 11th and head into Friday’s fixture fifth in the division after their opening seven matches.


  However, Hasenhuttl is refusing to get carried away with his side’s encouraging early-season form.


  “I have seen so many teams in the beginning of the season being top of the table and near the top, and then relegated,” the former RB Leipzig manager added.


  “We know things can change so quickly – a few injuries or something like that – but at the moment we are a very strong side and we showed again we can have a high level of performing.


  “Before I came here, I worked at a team where losing was nearly not allowed because we wanted to be top in Germany, and this mentality I tried to implement from the first day that I’m here.


  “We have that mentality of, I sometimes call it, we like to be the pirate and it’s more fun than to join the navy. So it’s definitely something we can use every day and makes it fun to go and grab some points from the big teams.”


  Hasenhuttl will be without Danny Ings for the visit of Newcastle after his star striker underwent surgery on a knee injury. The England international, who has scored five times this season, is set to be sidelined for at least one month.


  In his absence, Theo Walcott and Shane Long are in contention to spearhead Southampton’s attack alongside Che Adams.


  Hasenhuttl, 53, added: “Whoever gets the chance to play should know this is a big chance and grab it because we now have four to six weeks without Danny.


  “We need somebody who gives us alternatives, and who gives us the best opportunities for what we demand – we will take a decision from there.”

In addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), the Company also provides certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non- GAAP gross margin excludes stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of acquired technology. Non-GAAP net income (loss) exclude the effects of non-recurring items (including restructuring charges, severance payments, adjustments to contingent consideration related to acquisition, and expenses related to an arbitration proceeding for a disputed customer contract), write-down in value of property and equipment, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets, and their related income tax effects, as applicable, as well as adjustments for the non-cash portion of income taxes and tax impact of the CARES Act. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management internally to measure the Company's profitability and performance. PDF Solutions' management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental measures to investors regarding the Company's ongoing operations in light of the fact that none of these categories of expense has a current effect on the future uses of cash (with the exception of certain non- recurring items) nor do they impact the generation of current or future revenues. These non- GAAP results should not be considered an alternative to, or a substitute for, GAAP financial information, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In particular, these non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures of income or loss as a measure of performance, or to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to measure profitability and performance; these non-GAAP measures are presented here to give investors an opportunity to see the Company's financial results as viewed by management. A detailed reconciliation of the adjustments made to comparable GAAP measures is included herein.

Chicago White Sox center fielder Luis Robert won a Gold Glove Award in his rookie season.
   
 Chicago Cubs shortstop Javier Baez finally won his first Gold Glove in his seventh season of excelling in the infield while Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo took home his fourth award.
   
 In St. Louis, Cardinals outfielder Tyler O'Neill won for the first time. Although second baseman Kolton Wong won for the second time, his honor comes a week after taking a call from the club saying they would not be exercising his $12.5-million option for 2021.
   
 National and American League winners were announced Tuesday night.
   
 White Sox
   
 Robert is the first Sox rookie to win the award and the fifth Sox outfielder, joining Ken Berry (1970), Tommie Agee (1966), Jim Landis (1961-64) and Minnie Minoso (1957, '60).
   
 "I have always dreamed of winning a Gold Glove, so this is a dream come true," Robert said in a statement. "I joked around this season with (infielder) Yolmer Sanchez about the possibility of winning it one day and being a Gold Glover like him."
   
 Robert, who is one of three finalists for AL Rookie of the Year, sometimes showed his range by stepping in front of left fielder Eloy Jimenez to make a catch. He had a .994 fielding percentage, committed one error in 154 chances, led all AL outfielders in total chances and ranked sixth in the league overall in defensive WAR (1.0).
   
 Cubs
   
 Baez, who moved between several infield positions during his first five seasons, said he appreciated settling in at shortstop on a full-time basis in 2019.
   
 "It's a different feeling when you have that commitment to that position," Baez said on ESPN's awards show Tuesday night.
   
 Baez is the first Cubs shortstop to win a Gold Glove since Don Kessinger in 1970.
   
 Baez committed eight errors in 56 games, but because of the truncated 60-game season, qualifications were limited to two types of defensive metrics: those from batted ball location-based data and those gathered from play-by-play accounts, including information from MLB Advanced Media's Statcast, Sports Information Solutions and STATS LLC.
   
 "I go for my defense, and people recognize me for my defense," he said.
   
 Rizzo is one of three Cubs first basemen to earn a Gold Glove with fellow four-time winner Mark Grace (1992-93, 1995-96) and Derrek Lee (2005, 2007).
   
 "To win a Gold Glove is something I'll never take for granted," said Rizzo.
   
 Cardinals
   
 "Such a punch to the gut," Wong said Tuesday night from his home in Hawaii. "I gave my heart and soul to the organization. Working my way up, learning, going back to the minors, and then to battle, to work, to figure things out, and to fight my way back up -- that was everything to me. I know I can be better. And just as I'm starting to figure out what my game brings to this new age of baseball."
   
 Since free agency opened this past weekend, Wong has heard from at least a half dozen teams with interest. A source previously confirmed the Los Angeles Angels as one of those teams.
   
 A Cardinals official said they hope to talk to Wong as the free-agent market develops.
   
 Wong was hoping for that conversation, not just a call.
   
 "That was shocking to me because I get it, I get what the season was like," Wong said. "If they wanted to restructure my contract because of COVID-19, I'm in. Let's have that talk. If they want to backload my deal, OK, let's talk. I understand this is a business, and I'm still open to it. Keep that door open while looking at others. I love being a Cardinal. I was there for seven years, and I've done so many things with that organization. It's where I wanted to finish off, in St. Louis."
   
 O'Neill won his first career Gold Glove in part because of his four Outs Above Average, which tied with teammate and center fielder Harrison Bader for the 12th-best among outfielders at any position. O'Neill led all left fielders; the next closest had 1 OAA. He did not commit an error in 344 innings, and he had 89 putouts in left field. That was the most in the National League.
   
 Derrick Goold of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and Mark Gonzales and LaMond Pope of the Chicago Tribune contributed to this story.

Within the black community, particularly among men, polls since Tuesday’s election show Biden reached a new low for their votes.
 Trump gained endorsements from rappers such as Lil Wayne, Ice Cube and Kanye West while claiming no one had done more for the African American community.
 On the campaign trail, the US leader also hammered “Sleepy Joe” on his record in the Senate, none more so than for his actions in the 1990’s “tough on crime” era. Biden voted for mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and increased funding for federal jails – policies that contributed to the mass ­incarceration of black men.
 But voters, including hundreds of thousands of Republicans, say they backed him for his decency.
 And he pledged to fight for those who did not vote for him as much as those who did.

 “STOP THE COUNT!” he proclaimed. But the president has no authority over election counting and halting the count at that moment would have resulted in a swift victory for his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.
 “ANY VOTE THAT CAME IN AFTER ELECTION DAY WILL NOT BE COUNTED!” he later wrote. That seemed to advocate tossing out untold legally cast votes, including those from service members stationed overseas. Many states accept mail-in ballots after Election Day as long as they were postmarked by Nov. 3.

Ralph Hasenhuttl said it would have been “stupid” to predict Southampton could stand at the summit of English football.


  Victory against Newcastle at St Mary’s Stadium tomorrow night will see the Saints spend at least a day at the top of the Premier League for the first time in the club’s history.


  Indeed, it is 32 years, when Southampton were managed by Chris Nicholl, that they could last regard themselves as top-flight table-toppers.


  But following a run of four victories from their last five outings, Hasenhuttl’s side are on the brink of a small piece of history.


  “If you told me this would happen before the season, I would say you are a little bit stupid,” said Hasenhuttl. “We are lucky that we play Friday evening because it gives us a great chance.”


  It caps a remarkable 12 months for Hasenhuttl after his side were thrashed 9-0 by Leicester last October and facing up to the prospect of a relegation dogfight.

FERRY COUNTY, WA- The Ferry County Sheriff is trying to clear up confusion regarding the employment status of gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp. Culp, prior to running for governor, served as the Republic Police Chief before taking a leave of absence to campaign.
 In a Facebook video on Wednesday, Culp said that he had lost his job as Chief.
 "A couple days before this election, the city council had a special meeting," Culp said in the video, "and they voted to defund the police department, including my job."
 In a press release, the Ferry County Sheriff attempts to provide additional information as to why that happened. They say that the City of Republic and the Sheriff's Office recently signed contracts so that the Sheriff's office will provide police services for this year and as well as 2021-2022. The Sheriff's Office says that Republic requested Ferry County take over police services due to financial stress.

It’s easy to imagine the company led by Michel Vounatsos reaping gigantic revenue. Alzheimer’s is widespread and devastating, and there are no effective treatments. Doctor surveys have indicated a third of the 2.2 million Americans with mild dementia could be on a new drug within three years, Cowen analysts note. Assuming it’s priced at $50,000 a year, that’s approaching $40 billion of potential annual revenue. The bank warns, though, that real-world use would probably be lower. Assume annual sales at just a third of that level and put them on a multiple of five, a rule of thumb valuation metric for the industry, and Biogen's drug may be worth $60 billion or more. Biogen’s market capitalization prior to Wednesday’s news was $38 billion.

Cole McGourty knows all about the Milk Can rivalry.


  After all, he grew up right in the middle of it.


  “My father, Tom, went to North Hunterdon, and my mother, Tara, went to Voorhees,” said the Viking senior middle linebacker/h-back. “I’d say I’d been living the rivalry. It’s such a big game. It’s better than anything you can compare it to.”


  McGourty will be playing a major role when the teams meet for their storied trophy for the 45th time Friday night (7) at the Lions' Singley Field.


  “Cole is the prototypical middle linebacker,” Voorhees (2-3) head coach Ricky Kurtz said.


  McGourty will bring real physicality to the game as the Vikings shoot for their first Milk Can win since 2011. North Hunterdon (1-4) leads the series, 31-12-1.


  “I have been playing middle linebacker my whole life,” he said. “My job is an enforcer. I like big hits. I see my main role on defense as a battering ram when (other teams) ruin up the middle. You come up the middle, I am going to meet you with everything I have.”


  The 6-foot, 220-pound McGourty has modeled his after play one of the most distinctive players in recent NFL history.


  “He didn’t play my position, but I loved the intensity and ferocity that (Pittsburgh safety) Troy Polamalu brought to the field,” said McGourty, an Asbury resident. “I am a Pittsburgh Steelers fan, and my father is, too. I liked Troy’s mindset. He brought everything he had to the game. I tried to be the leader and mentor on the field that he was.”


  While McGourty has been wreaking havoc on defense, he’s been handling a changing role on offense.


  “I’m the jack of all trades,” he said.


  Kurtz, in trying to maximize McGourty’s athleticism and intensity, has had him, well, everywhere.


  “It’s been a lot different for Cole,” said Kurtz, who noted that McGourty had been a guard before this season.


  H-back, tight end, running back -- McGourty has been there. And it won’t be a surprise to know how he plays with the ball.


  “My sophomore and junior season I have been playing guard, and I’d been a lineman my whole life,” McGourty said. “But at a few camps I got to run the ball, and I’d just lower my shoulder and truck through people, and that was an awesome feeling. My senior year, I thought I wanted to do something for the team, and I thought I could do some decent running with the ball. I had to transform the mentality of Coach Kurtz about me, and he was open to the idea and gave me a chance to prove myself. I had to learn the formations, get all the alignments into my head.”


  Given the number of spots McGourty plays, that’s a lot of alignments, and he’s done it well enough to have made a huge contribution at all of them.


  “Now he’s played all kinds of positions and played them all well.” Kurtz said.


  His on-field contributions have been critical, but McGourty has been equally as important on leadership.


  “I couldn;t be happier with the way the team has come together and is supporting each other,” McGourty said. “Our young guys have done well; the sophomores have held their own really well.”


  It may be that, in no small part because of McGourty, the Voorhees sophomores -- and the rest of the team -- may wind up holding the Milk Can Friday.

And South Asia is home to the largest number of child brides, says UNICEF. Of 650 million women and girls in the world who were married before their 18th birthday, 285 million or more than 40% are in South Asia.
 The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) says coronavirus restrictions may delay interventions against child marriage and cause a long-lasting economic downturn that will push more families into poverty, which is a key driver of child marriage.
 So how do you stop a child marriage from taking place during a pandemic?
 Muttur says he often has to use harsh language to convince parents of child brides that what they're doing is wrong.
 "I tell them, 'by doing this, you are giving someone the permission to rape your daughter'," Muttur says.
 Like Muttur, Rolee Singh is getting lots of reports of child marriage in the offing. She lives in Varanasi, where she serves as program director of the nonprofit Dr. Shambhunath Singh Research Foundation.
 "The first tipoff I got was about a 14-year-old girl being married to a 30-year-old man," says Singh. She alerted the police and showed up with them at the temple where the wedding was taking place. She explained to the family that what they were doing was wrong and unlawful.
 "I also told them that if they delay their daughter's marriage till she turned 18, they would receive financial assistance as part of a government policy," says Singh. Eventually, the family was convinced and the wedding was stopped.
 During the pandemic, Singh says she has halted 5 marriages mid-ceremony and convinced almost two dozen families to call off the marriage before the wedding date.
 In India, if an adult man (over age 21) marries an underage bride, he and the girl's parents or guardians — along with anyone who officiates the marriage — are in violation of the law. If convicted, they can be sentenced to up to two years in prison or asked to pay a fine of more than $1,300, or both.
 According to data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau, 964 people were arrested under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act last year and 525 cases of child marriage were reported.
 But actual figures are hard to tally. A 2018 report by the Centre for Law and Policy Research in Bengaluru and the Center for Reproductive Rights in New York outlines several challenges in the implementation of the law including stigma faced by child brides whose marriage was halted and a low conviction rate for those accused. Muttur says a lot of child marriages are probably taking place unnoticed.
 Before the pandemic, the child marriage cases that Muttur encountered typically involved 16 or 17-year-olds. Now he's seeing brides as young as 12, he says.
 "These are families that survive on their day's earnings but during the pandemic, they've got no work," says Muttur. "Their financial situation is dire."
 India imposed an early and stringent lockdown which severely hurt its economy and was especially difficult for poor day laborers. Nearly 100 million of them lost their jobs and dozens died while trying to walk back to their native villages. India now has more than 8 million reported coronavirus cases, the second-highest in the world after the United States.
 Before the pandemic, under the government's mid-day meal scheme, students from lower-income families would get one meal at their school for free. But with schools closed, the meals have stopped and parents are scrambling to feed their kids. They're also worried about the virus, which is now spreading in rural areas where health-care facilities are scarce.
 "They think, 'If I die, what will happen to my family?' So they think it's better to get the girl married now. They feel like it's their duty," says Muttur. "They also think authorities are so busy with the coronavirus, that they can get away with this."
 But why would a man's family want to assume the additional financial burden of his wife?
 One motive could be India's skewed sex ratio — there are more men than women. "To find brides in the face of this sex ratio imbalance, some traditional- marriage-aged men must reach into younger female cohorts," note researchers Peter Leeson and Paola Suarez in their 2017 paper on child brides in India.
 Singh says often a man seeking a child bride is a widower or someone who can't find a bride his own age – perhaps because he has special medical needs. Such a man, who would normally have a hard time looking for a bride, finds it easier to get one during a pandemic because parents of girls are eager to marry them off, says Singh.
 The families of boys may be willing to bear the additional financial burden, even in a pandemic, because the alternative would be a son who remains unmarried.
 One way to keep child marriages in check during the pandemic is to recognize child protection workers as essential workers, says Gabrielle Szabo, senior gender equality adviser at Save the Children in London.
 "[To] make sure they have access to protective equipment to continue to do that work safely," Szabo says.
 Szabo also notes that child marriages spike during crises because of the common belief that marrying a girl to a man protects her from violence from other men in the community.
 Singh witnessed that firsthand when her town saw an influx of men left unemployed because of the lockdown.
 "Young men started behaving indecently, roaming around, catcalling girls or harassing them," says Singh. "So families were feeling scared and hurried to get their daughters married."
 Those kinds of concerns convinced 40-year-old Dattatray Shankar Sutar that a marriage should be arranged for his youngest niece, Sau Sutar, 17. Her father died in February. When schools closed due to the pandemic, Sau was left at home all day while her mother worked in the fields to earn money to feed Sau and her 10-year-old brother.
 So Sutar and other relatives arranged Sau's marriage to a man in his 20s.
 "We thought we should get her married for her own safety," says the uncle.
 Community representatives alerted authorities, who intervened and convinced the family to cancel the marriage. The family signed a statement promising not to marry off Sau married before she turns 18.
 "I was relieved when the marriage was called off," says the teenager. "I always felt strange about it but I thought there was no other option."
 She wants to study humanities and will start 11th grade whenever her school reopens.

LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Two own goals helped Arsenal recover from falling behind to crush Molde 4-1 in Europa League Group B on Thursday, with Nicolas Pepe and Joe Willock also scoring for the Londoners.


  Arsenal struggled to deal with Molde's aggressive pressing game and that led to Martin Ellingsen's opening goal as the Norwegians won the ball in midfield and he fired home a dipping shot from outside the area in the 22nd minute.


  The home side equalised in first-half stoppage time after a sweeping move from a Molde corner. Eddie Nketiah whipped in a low centre from the right and Kristoffer Haugen bundled the ball into his own net.


  Defender Sead Kolasinac missed a glorious chance for Arsenal, hoofing the ball over an open goal from close range, but they went ahead in the 62nd minute when Willock pulled the ball across and Sheriff Sinyan shanked it into his own net.


  Pepe made it three eight minutes later with a thumping left-foot shot before Arsenal turned the tables by pressuring a Molde clearance, winning the ball and setting up Willock to score.


  Arsenal top Group B on a maximum nine points from three games, three ahead of Molde. Rapid Vienna, who beat Irish side Dundalk 4-3 earlier in the evening, are third on three points.

Police arrested dozens of people in New York, Portland, Oregon, and other cities overnight at protests demanding all votes be counted in the race for the White House, while smaller groups backing President Donald Trump returned to tabulation sites in closely contested states to cry foul over the election. In Minneapolis, police cited more than 600 demonstrators who marched onto a highway Wednesday night protesting Trump’s threats to challenge the election results, as well as a variety of social injustices, authorities said Thursday. The protests came as the Trump campaign insisted, without evidence, that there were major problems with the voting and the counting of ballots. In Portland, some marchers smashed the windows of businesses and hurled fireworks at officers as uncertainty over the election combined with months of unrest over racial injustice and other causes. Police made at least 12 arrests. As the city cleaned up on Thursday, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown drew a line between a peaceful gathering by marchers aligned with the Black Lives Matter movement and “self-styled anarchist protesters” who damaged buildings, including a church that feeds the homeless. “Indiscriminate destruction solves nothing.

Washington’s farmworkers are 99 percent Latino.


  “Excluding farmworkers from health and safety protections cannot be justified by an assertion that the agricultural industry, and society’s general welfare, depends on a caste system that is repugnant to our nation’s best self,” González wrote.


  The ruling came in a 2016 lawsuit that two workers, Jose Martinez-Cuevas and Patricia Aguilar, brought on behalf of 300 workers against DeRuyter Brothers Dairy in Outlook, southeast of Yakima. The dairy’s milking facilities were operated around the clock, and workers were required to stay until all cows were milked and to help clean the barn.


  The dairy paid $600,000 to settle most of the claims, including that it failed to provide meal and rest breaks, but the workers’ argument that they were entitled to OT had not been resolved. The dairy has been sold to another operator.

With cases of COVID-19 rising rapidly in Southwest Virginia, it could become more difficult to reach people quickly to let them know they have been exposed to the virus.


  Dr. Cynthia Morrow, director of the Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts, is asking people who receive positive test results to help out by thinking about who they might have been near and then reaching out to those people.


  To help halt the spread to the disease, those who might have been exposed are asked to quarantine. The disease can be spread before people develop symptoms — and even if they have no symptoms at all.


  “Our case counts have gone up dramatically in the last two weeks. We expect this trend is going to continue. For that reason we have to prioritize our case investigations,” she said. “So it’s really important for everybody to help each other by notifying people they have been around if they tested positive for COVID-19”

Pittsburgh is wrapping up three straight road games with the first of three in a row against teams with a combined 5-17-1 record (Cincinnati and Jacksonville are next). The previous three opponents had one or no losses after Week 6 (Cleveland, Tennessee and Baltimore). The last team to run such a gauntlet was Super Bowl-winning New England in 2004.


  “The last two weeks have been just draining games,” Roethlisberger said. “We might be drained during the week and whatnot, so this is one of those weeks where you mentally focus on the preparation in terms of the meeting time and things like that. When Sunday comes, you can be as tired as you want during the week, you have to dial it in and get ready to go.”

What we have sacrificed through all of this is our “countryhood.” I know that isn’t a word but it needs to be right now. We, as Americans, have an ideology to protect. We have embodied freedom and liberty and fought for it to the death. And yet, we have compromised it during this election. We have to find middle ground again and we need to do it in tandem with the faith-based community, those who have been disenfranchised, those who serve us (doctors, nurses and civil servants), employers, businesses and civic leaders.


  Civil Rights issues must be addressed, acknowledged and implemented. Education needs to be examined and opened to everyone. If we haven’t learned anything from this we should have learned that our entire way of doing business has to be more fluid because nature can take over and we are back in a holding pattern when it does. COVID has to be our top priority because the numbers have exploded. In the beginning I didn’t know anyone who had it, now I can count 14 people I know or I have met who have died from it. It seems we all know multiple people struggling with COVID right now. We should give a resounding thanks to our health care workers, our civil servants and our health department for all the hard work and diligent care they provided.


  Ironically, it almost feels like we have to rebuild, not physically but morally and ethically. A sense of pride is only achieved when someone feels like they have contributed something of value, something that can’t be measured by money or position, but rather by hard work and diligence because you believed so fervently in what you were doing.


  There was so much to still be done before this election — homelessness, substance abuse, domestic violence, those working below a living wage, suicide, the list goes on and on — and I am sure that in many instance we will return to working on the list as we were before. I really believe that some things have changed permanently. I don’t think we will ever have a quiet election again; I don’t believe we will ever know with certainty that our election process can be safe; I don’t believe we will have a real trust of each other for a long time.


  What I do believe is that we will survive, we have to. The world is watching. We will quiet down, as COVID is dealt with by the most brilliant medical minds in the world. We will heal and begin to live our lives again, however cautiously. As we do, we must learn that we are Americans first and Democrats and Republicans last.

The Job Retention Scheme, which was introduced alongside the national lockdown in March and helped keep a lid on unemployment, was due to expire at the end of October and to be replaced by a less generous program. However, it was reinstated on Saturday when the government abruptly announced another lockdown for England to last until Dec. 2.The lockdown will see millions of workers going idle once again as it requires all non-essential venues such as pubs, restaurants, and stores selling items like books, clothing and sneakers, to close. The support package for self-employed workers was also made more generous.“It’s clear the economic effects are much longer lasting for businesses than the duration of any restrictions, which is why we have decided to go further with our support,” Sunak told lawmakers.The extension was welcomed by all types of businesses as it relieves the pressure on them in what would traditionally be the busiest and financially most important time of the year — the run-up to Christmas.“Hospitality is facing a tough winter, so this enhanced support is crucial and will safeguard jobs and help businesses to plan for more certain future,” said Kate Nicholls, CEO of the U.K. Hospitality lobby group.The Bank of England estimates that the number of people on furlough will more than double in November to 5.5 million. At the height of the program in the spring, around 9 million workers, or around a third of the workforce, were on furlough.The government had for months balked at calls for an extension, arguing it wasn’t its role to support every job in the economy forever. It was no doubt also concerned about the cost of the program, which has reached 40 billion pounds.While welcoming the move, the main opposition Labour Party criticized Sunak for failing to act sooner, a delay that it says generated uncertainty and prompted some firms to dismiss staff in recent weeks. The government said the furlough scheme could be backdated so anyone who was on a payroll on Sept. 23 but then made redundant, can be re-employed.“This cycle of bluster, denial and then running to catch up is costing jobs and causing chaos,” said Labour’s economy spokeswoman, Anneliese Dodds.Though the furlough program prevented mass unemployment, the jobless rate has edged up from a four-decade low of 3.8% to 4.5%, with the likes of British Airways, Royal Mail and Rolls-Royce all laying off thousands.On Thursday, supermarket chain Sainsbury’s became the latest big company to announce hefty cuts. It said it will shed around 3,500 jobs as part of plans to permanently close its meat, fish and deli counters, as well as some of its Argos standalone stores.Sunak’s latest change came after the Bank of England warned that the British economy is set for another downturn in the winter, with the economy forecast to contract a further 2% in the fourth quarter. It laid out the hope that a recession — widely defined as two straight quarters of contraction — may be avoided but said the outlook remains “unusually uncertain.”Given that backdrop, its nine-member policymaking panel agreed to increase the bank’s bond-buying program in an attempt to ensure banks carry on lending to the wider economy. The stimulus was bigger than the 100 billion pounds anticipated in financial markets. The Monetary Policy Committee also unanimously kept the bank’s main interest rate at a record low of 0.1%.“We believe there is value in acting quickly and strongly to support the economy and avoid the risks of any short-term disruption,” Bank Governor Andrew Bailey told reporters.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

“I don’t think there’s a problem with letting voters reconsider it,” said Republican state Sen. Dan Hegeman, who sponsored this year's measure. He said it returns redistricting to “a tried and true method."
 Missouri's 2018 initiative had been part of a national movement aimed at combating partisan gerrymandering, which occurs when politicians draw voting districts to give themselves or their political parties an advantage in future elections.
 Voters in Colorado, Michigan, Ohio and Utah all passed redistricting overhauls that year. Virginia voters approved a constitutional amendment Tuesday that will shift redistricting power away from its legislature, currently controlled by Democrats, to a bipartisan commission of lawmakers and citizens.
 The original Clean Missouri measure also limited lobbyist gifts and campaign contributions to lawmakers, and made lawmakers' records open to the public. The ballot summary listed all of those things while also noting it changed the “process and criteria for redrawing state legislative districts.” But the ballot summary provided no specifics of how redistricting would change.
 The 2018 measure directed a new nonpartisan demographer to draw state House and Senate districts to achieve “partisan fairness” and "competitiveness" based on the average votes that Republicans and Democrats received in the three previous elections for president, U.S. Senate and governor. It made Missouri the first state to use a specific formula, known as the “efficiency gap," to calculate political fairness.
 An Associated Press analysis determined that the formula likely would have allowed Democrats to cut into Republicans' supermajorities in the Missouri Legislature in the upcoming 2022 elections.

Why I fly the flag upside down


--DocBreak--
While at the Latrobe Farmers Market one Tuesday, I was sharing an expression with a fellow when he abruptly stopped me and stated, “Oh, I know that one. I learned that in elementary school while attending Catholic school.” What I was explaining to him was that “If you point your finger at someone, there will always be three fingers pointing back at you.” I had heard this saying only a few weeks prior, but he, many years before.


  I found the wording a learning experience. However, it must be understood, I’m not the type that goes around pointing my index finger in people’s faces and blaming them with all kinds of thoughts. I was never brought up that way. I never developed that habit.


  Let’s say it became a practice for me. Using my imagination, I could see myself walking up to a person who discarded a candy wrapper on the street and yell with my finger pointing to the individual, “Hey you! Pick up that Mars candy wrapper you tossed on my street!” I thought the pointing would draw attention followed by the word “my.” Even though all the roads are ours in a sense, since we pay taxes to maintain them, I didn’t sense being out of line saying what I did.


  What do you suppose my three fingers were indicating? In my opinion, the first would be tone of voice. Instead of screaming at the individual, maybe using some tone of politeness may be more fitting. “Excuse me sir but littering the Latrobe street makes our community a bit messy. Could you kindly pick up that Mars wrapper you dropped on the street and discard it when you get home?” I realize that is a chancy approach, for people nowadays don’t always see things the same way we do.


  Another approach may be, “Excuse me sir, would it be OK if I discarded your Mars wrapper for you? Leaving it on the street makes Latrobe a messy place to live. Now, you wouldn’t want people to think that, would you?” Here again, one may be “challenged” with words unfitting to be heard by anyone. That’s just the chance one has to take. Remember, instead of the index finger, the further finger may be coming into play.


  And third, just pick up the wrapper without saying a word. Place it in a plastic bag you carry for such purposes without saying a word. Down deep in your heart you will know that you did the right thing and peacefully go on your way. Note that maybe somebody else saw this gesture and will follow in your footsteps. What a wonderful way to keep our city clean.


  Now that you think of it, don’t the above ideas make more sense than sticking one’s finger toward someone else’s face, being grouchy, and demanding? We are supposed to be peaceful, loving individuals. Being controlling and demanding is not the way to carry out constructive criticisms. Always contemplate all actions before following through.


  As I stared at that hand formation, right away, I thought of a “gun” that I was holding in my right hand. Each finger had a purpose. It was up to me how I would utilize the digits. Would I aimlessly fire at my target using my index finger? Would my middle finger be the trigger finger? Would the fourth and fifth fingers represent the bottom part of the body of the weapon?


  What would happen if we clasp our hands together? There would be no reason for animosity, but peace through prayer. Anytime fingers are joined in various patterns they spell out worship, at least to me. If you arrange the fingers to form a triangle with the thumbs pointed toward one’s nose, I sense reverence to God. Same is true when I engage my hands tightly, bowing my head as I pray. Every finger has a purpose. To me, that is special.


  What’s the point to this story today? It’s what you do with your fingers. When I see somebody doing something I may disapprove of, my first thought is to think first before acting. We do have a choice. Make it a wise one.

  Nov 5 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc said on Thursday that demand for its food-delivery service expanded in the latest quarter, but its global rides business was seeing its slowest recovery rate in the United States, its most important market.


  Uber reported revenue for the third quarter that lagged Wall Street views and a wider loss than expected.


  Uber executives cautioned that ride demand in Europe, which recovered faster than any other region in the quarter, was likely to decline as several countries on the continent reimposed lockdown measures.


  The company's shares were down 1% in after-hours trading as Uber recorded greater adjusted losses before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the third quarter than Wall Street expected.


  Uber posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of $625 million versus analyst expectations of a $597 million EBITDA loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.


  Non-adjusted earnings per share came in at a loss of 62 cents, compared with a 65-cent loss estimated by analysts.


  Despite no end in sight for the pandemic, Uber reaffirmed its target to achieve quarterly adjusted EBITDA profitability before the end of 2021. It said it would hit that goal even if gross bookings for rides remained 10% to 20% below pre-pandemic levels, thanks to cost reductions and margin improvements at its Eats delivery business.


  Revenue at Uber's delivery unit, including Uber Eats, more than doubled to $1.45 billion, its highest ever, but the unit continues to lose money despite narrowing losses over the past quarters.


  Uber continues to spend money to gain market share over food-delivery competitors. The company is hoping to close its $2.65 billion acquisition of smaller delivery rival Postmates in the first quarter of 2021 to expand further.


  Overall, Uber recorded $3.13 billion in third-quarter revenue, falling short of analysts' average estimate of $3.2 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.


  Demand for ride-hailing trips, responsible for nearly two-thirds of Uber's revenue prior to the pandemic, continued to recover from an 80% drop in April at the height of the pandemic.


  Gross bookings at its mobility unit remained down 50% from last year on a constant currency basis, dragged down by a slow recovery in the United States, particularly on the West Coast. Ride bookings in Europe and the Middle East recovered more steadily, down only 36% from last year.


  But unlike Uber's other units, the rides segment delivered adjusted EBITDA of $245 million.


  Overall, Uber posted a net loss of $1.1 billion in the months from July to September, including stock-based compensation expenses.


  The company has also gradually reduced its stake in noncore business units over the past months. A German company in September acquired Uber's European freight business and Uber has reportedly been seeking options for its Uber Elevate business.


  Uber's third-quarter results come just two days after it scored a significant win in its California home market, where voters passed a company-sponsored ballot measure that went at the heart of the gig economy business model Uber helped create.


  With a 58% majority, California voters cemented app-based food-delivery and ride-hail drivers' status as independent contractors, not employees entitled to costly benefits including unemployment pay and health insurance.


  California drivers instead will receive more limited benefits, including minimum pay rates, healthcare subsidies and accident insurance.


  Uber, its smaller rival Lyft Inc, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates, who jointly spent more than $200 million on the ballot campaign, hope to turn the California decision into a model for the nation.

  However, Stoinis made good progress and he found a strong ally in Axar Patel, with the pair putting on 71 from 44 balls to give Delhi a glimmer of hope before Bumrah extinguished it once and for all.


  The Mumbai paceman bowled Stoinis with a delivery that kept low, adding his fourth wicket by having Sams caught behind later in the over - and, despite Patel's effort of 42 from 33 balls, the Capitals fell well short at 143-8.

The flurry of policy pronouncements flowing out of the White House ahead of the election has slowed to a trickle.

On April 21, 2020, the Company entered into amendments with respect to certain of its residential whole loan facilities. These amendments mainly served to convert an existing residential whole loan facility into a term facility by removing any mark to market margin requirements, and to consolidate the Company's Non-Qualified Mortgage loans, which were previously financed by three separate, unaffiliated counterparties, into a single facility. The target advance rate under the amended and restated facility was approximately 84% of the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the loans. The facility's scheduled maturity was October 20, 2021. All principal payments and income generated by the loans during the term of the facility were used to pay principal and interest on the facility. Upon the securitization or sale by the Company of any whole loan subject to this amended and restated facility, the counterparty was entitled to receive a 30% premium recapture fee of all realized value on any whole loans above such counterparty's amortized basis as well as an exit fee of 0.50% of the loan amount in circumstances where the counterparty was not involved in the disposition of the loans.

National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has capped the volume of transactions via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) on third-party apps at 30 per cent. In statement issued on Thursday, the retail payments body said this decision is meant to protect the payments channel from risks as it grows in scale.


  "National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) said that with UPI reaching 2 billion transactions a month and with potential for future growth, it has issued a cap of 30 per cent of total volume of transactions processed in UPI, applicable on all Third Party App Providers (TPAPs). This will be with effect from January 1, 2021. It will help to address the risks and protect the UPI ecosystem as it further scales up," the statement read.


  This limit of 30 per cent will be calculated on the basis of total volume of transactions processed in UPI during the preceding three months (on a rolling basis). The existing third-party UPI apps exceeding the specified cap, will have a period of two years from January 2021, to comply with this transaction volume cap in a phased manner, NPCI said.


  NPCI has not clarified as to what will happen once a third-party app hits the mandated volume limit of 30 per cent. The move will take a toll on applications like Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm and others. It might lead to rise in number of failed transactions, to the dismay of users.


  Earlier, NPCI granted its approval to WhatsApp to go live on its UPI platform and expand its users in a phased manner. The messaging application has been allowed to register a user base of 20 million for now.

 # Biden erases 14,000-vote lead by Trump on Election Day, now trails by just 542 votes
 Matthew Rink
 Erie Times-News
 Former Vice President Joe Biden appears on track to overtake President Donald Trump in Erie County by the time a remaining 4,700 mail-in votes are counted at the end of the day.
 Biden has whittled what was a nearly 14,000-vote lead for Trump on Election Day down to a 542-vote deficit as of 4 p.m. Thursday. There remain more than 4,700 mail-in and absentee votes still to count. Erie County elections officials planned to count those remaining votes by the end of the day Thursday.
 On Friday morning, they will start counting another 2,500 provisional ballots.
 Voter turnout has now surpassed 64 percent with more than 130,000 voters casting ballots out of the 202,000 registered. In 2016, 126,000 people cast ballots in Erie County.
 The latest update from the Erie County Board of Elections was preceded by an email to Erie County Democrats from local party Chairman Jim Wertz, who encouraged them to "be patient" and "stay strong."
 "While it's too early to celebrate, there is plenty to be hopeful for at this hour," Wertz wrote.
 Trump in 2016 became the first Republican presidential nominee since 1984 to win Erie County. His slim victory of just 1,957 votes over Democrat Hillary Clinton made Erie County a must-watch county in a battleground state. It was one of only 206 counties nationwide and three in the state that flipped to Trump after twice supporting former President Barack Obama.
 Since then, local Democrats have been trying to paint Trump's 2016 victory as a matter of happenstance, rather than a reflection of a larger shift away from the once reliably blue electorate.
 Trump, who campaigned in Erie on Oct. 20, his third visit here since launching his presidential run in 2015, has banked on Pennsylvania in his reelection bid. But since counties like Erie began counting their mail-in and absentee ballots, the president has watched his Election Day lead dwindle.
 The Trump campaign on Wednesday filed a lawsuit attempting to halt the counting in Pennsylvania, arguing a lack of "transparency."
 On Thursday, counting was halted in Philadelphia temporarily as a compromise was negotiated over how close GOP observers could be to those sorting ballots. A federal judge called an emergency hearing Thursday evening to review the matter.
 None of the legal action taken Wednesday or Thursday has yet to affect the counting of ballots in Erie County.
 As of 6 p.m., Trump's statewide lead over Biden continued to narrow. Trump was once ahead of Biden by more than 600,000 votes. His lead was down to 90,542 votes with an estimated 93 percent of the vote in. Those remaining votes, predominantly from mail-in ballots, are expected to favor Biden.

On Sunday afternoon at Phoenix Raceway, the NASCAR Cup Series season, dramatically altered by a once-in-a-century pandemic, will come to an end with the running of the Season Finale 500.      For Matt DiBenedetto and the Motorcraft/Quick Lane team, it’s been a year of learning each other and overcoming obstacles.      After racing resumed following a break due to the coronavirus, new NASCAR rules cut out practice and qualifying for all but one race – at Charlotte Motor Speedway. That made it tough for DiBenedetto and the Motorcraft/Quick Lane team as they navigated their first season together.      “We had a lot thrown at us, and it was especially hard on us being a new group,” DiBenedetto said. “There are a lot of things we would have learned in practice and been able to apply to the car in a normal year. Instead, we had to learn during the race.      “We still made the Playoffs, had a lot of success, especially in the latter part of the season.”      DiBenedetto and the No. 21 team have turned in some strong numbers over the course of the season. They scored three top-three finishes and 10 top-10s. They scored 107 Stage points, and enter this weekend’s season finale 14th in the points standings, just 11 markers behind 12th place. DiBenedetto’s previous best finish in the final points standings was 22nd, before he joined the Wood Brothers team.      He said this season’s performance has him already looking forward to 2021.      “As a team we’re just now getting on the same page,” he said. “We’re meshing better, and now we are able to turn bad days into good solid runs. That’s what strong teams do.      “We’ll be way, way further ahead when we start next season.”      The 2020 season also saw DiBenedetto sign up to drive the No. 21 Mustang for 2021, and he said he has one main goal in mind for the upcoming year.      “I want to get the Wood Brothers their 100th win and some more as well,” he said. “I want that 100th win more than anything. The Woods are a great family, and it’s a great honor to drive for them - a dream come true.      “I will remember this time for the rest of my life.”      But before DiBenedetto and the Motorcraft/Quick Lane team turn their attention to 2021, there’s still Sunday’s 312-miler at Phoenix to run.      “Phoenix is one of my favorite tracks,” said DiBenedetto, who will start 12th. “It’s kind of a short track. We’ll run the low-downforce, high-horsepower package, and I enjoy those races the most.”      He said he’s heartened by the speed the No. 21 Mustang had at Phoenix back in March, when he finished 13th.      “We had a fast car, but we didn’t quite keep up with the adjustments,” he said. “We have lots to build on from the spring. It’s a good place for us.”      Sunday’s 500-kilometer race is set to get the green flag just after 3 p.m. Eastern Time with TV coverage on NBC.

"The regional race was unbelievable for the kids. It seemed like we faced adversity this whole year, and it was great to see them run their best race of the season so far," said Schroeder. "Losing Ricky Gambill to start the season put a damper on our goal of a top-five team at state. You can't replace a kid like Ricky. But before the race I told the kids that we do not need an unbelievable performance, all we have to do is be ourselves. Gabe (Morrell) and Mason (Breech) have been huge for closing out the scoring. They run hard wire-to-wire," said Schroeder. "We had kids step up and fight through this whole year to win SOC (Southern Ohio Conference), be district runners-up, and make it to state for the second year in a row. I hope the kids realize how big of a deal that is."

If he is unable to play, the Wildcats will turn to Sammy Wheeler and Nick Lenners to replace him at tight end.
 Wheeler is known more as a pass-catcher than as a blocker, but Messingham said he has improved enough in that area recently to be trusted in the running game. Lenners can do both.
 K-State may also give extra opportunities to fullbacks Jax Dineen and Mason Barta if Moore misses the game.
 "Jax has got a little bit more quick twitch," Messingham said. "He's a fluid athlete, even though he may not look like that. He's a fluid athlete who catches the ball naturally. At some point we need to get him more involved with the run game in terms of handing the ball to him. We need to throw him a bone a little bit and let him carry it, because he can do something with it."

“Do I think that based on what I’ve heard now and what I’ve seen that maybe this was a little overblown? I will at this point say that I believe what elections [officials] have said verbally and I will take them at their word," Brnovich told 12 News. "I don’t think anyone in Arizona was consciously trying to create a controversy or a conspiracy. Because at the end of the day, think about this, if indeed there was an issue with sharpies, I mean, I’m not a math whiz, that would have affected both parties equally."
