There's something exceptionally unique about all the magnificent research supported by NASA - it's available, for nothing, to everybody. It was the unique moment when NASA reported this move to open access in 2016. Not only exclusively would all distributed research supported by the space organization be accessible at no cost, but also the office likewise propelled an open online interface to make it simple for anyone to get access. The free online document touched base in light of a key approach refresh, which requires any NASA-subsidized research articles in peer-audited diaries be openly available inside one year of production.

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Bangladesh garment manufacturers says fashion retailers have cancelled or put on hold more than $3 billion in orders due to the coronavirus outbreak, though a handful have agreed to pay anyway. The data from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association released Monday reflected both orders already made or in the works and planned orders from the country, which is the world's second largest exporter of clothing after China. The cancelled orders, according to reports to the BGMEA from manufacturers, included tens of millions in purchases from many big buyers, including European buyers C&A and Inditex, Primark of Ireland, Britain's Marks & Spencer and Tesco and U.S. retailers like Walmart and Target. Bangladesh is just beginning to feel the direct impact of the pandemic and its government has ordered a shut down of most businesses to help contain it. But shocks to the country's export markets have been cascading into its economy for weeks. A survey of factory owners in Bangladesh released Friday showed millions of Bangladesh factory workers being sent home without the wages or severance pay they are owed. The BGMEA reported that $1.8 billion in orders have been put on hold and another $1.4 billion have been cancelled. Cancellations of planned orders, for April-December, amounted to nearly $1.7 billion, it said. The figures are conservative because they exclude orders that would go to multiple buyers. The new data were incorporated into a report by Pennsylvania State University's Center for Global Workers' Rights and the Worker Rights Consortium, a Washington, D.C.-based labor rights organization,. Bangladesh manufacturers and labor groups have been appealing to big retailers to honor their commitments to suppliers. . ..

However, in the latest press conference from the government, deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries warned it could be half a year until normal service resumes.
 Confirming that the current measures will be reviewed every three weeks, she added it would be ‘quite dangerous’ to return to normal life and that measures could be reduced gradually over time.
 Dr Harries added that it could be two or three months before we see the longer-term impact, and about three to six months to see "at which point we can actually get back to normal" but added "it is plausible it could go further than that".
 While the suspension of football fixtures came before the government’s lockdown, there is no possibility for football to return with supporters in the stadiums until those restrictions are lifted - and playing matches behind closed doors is also not possible due to the banning of groups over the size of two.

While global borders remain shut, high-profile infected persons cannot travel abroad as they used to, and have to fall back on the health facilities abandoned for decades to rot and under-perform. While massive healthcare reforms are anticipated in the long term, the risk of preferential treatment for high-profile infectees looms large. Substantiated media reports reveal cases of alleged preferential treatment for foreign nationals and high-profile patients. These treatment patterns fuel fears that COVID-19 response measures may perpetuate inequalities in access to health care in critical times like this. Urgent steps must be taken to restore public confidence in the health systems by ensuring all persons—irrespective of their social and economic background, identity, sex, religion, ethnic group, sexual identity—have equal access to healthcare.
