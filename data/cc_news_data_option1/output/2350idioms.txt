Outright calling for a work slowdown is illegal, but unions have gotten away with suggesting them
 During the 2014 slowdown, police unions denied it had been officially sanctioned.
 During last summer's slowdown, Patrick Lynch -- the longtime president of the Police Benevolent Association -- urged officers to "proceed with the utmost caution" in light of the firing of Pantaleo.
 "We are urging all New York City police officers to proceed with the utmost caution in this new reality, in which they may be deemed 'reckless' just for doing their job," Lynch said at the time. "We will uphold our oath, but we cannot and will not do so by needlessly jeopardizing our careers or personal safety."
 Joe Giacalone, a former NYPD sergeant and professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said unions in New York know better than to call for a slowdown in explicit terms but some officers might "do things on their own."

First-timers on the ballot include former Georgia cornerback Champ Bailey, Syracuse defensive end Dwight Freeney and Kansas State running back Darren Sproles and Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops.
 To be eligible, a player must have received first-team All-American recognition by one of the five major selectors during his career and be 10 years removed from his final year playing college football.
 Ballots were sent to 12,000 National Football Foundation members and current Hall of Famers, and the NFF’s Honors Court will select the class from the top vote-getters. The College Hall of Fame class of 2021 will be announced early next year.

The presentations, which were originally scheduled for April, were changed to a streaming presentation because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 This is Roku’s first time participating in the NewFronts, which are often compared with the Upfronts for network television. At the Upfronts, media agencies preview television programming for the coming network seasons and have the opportunity to secure TV advertising slots at favorable rates.
 The NewFronts focus on new media, like OTT (over the top) television, gaming and e-sports. With the growth in advertising among these media, the NewFronts have gained prominence.
 It makes sense for Roku, the leading streaming platform in the United States, to be participating because it has made advertising an important part of its business model. The company offers a streaming device, a platform for various streaming services and a free Roku channel supported by advertising.
 “Streaming is accelerating more than ever before, and linear TV’s future is pretty unknown,” Allison Levin, Roku’s vice president of ad sales and strategy, told Variety in an interview. “We believe that this really is the moment, and this is the streaming decade.”
 ## A More Targeted Approach to Advertising
 Roku just announced that it is partnering with Kroger Precision Marketing on a new shopper data program to make TV advertising more precise and measurable for consumer packaged goods marketers.
 The intent of the partnership is to build a first-to-market targeting and attribution tool for streaming TV. This could eventually be a powerful tool for creating advertising revenue, by offering advertisers a more targeted approach.
 Once integration is complete, marketers will have access to Kroger data science for targeting and closed-loop attribution to measure campaign performance across the Roku platform. At the same time, the marketers will have tools available from Roku to measure the effectiveness of linear TV built on the largest licensed TV operating system in North America.

While more than half of Manitoba small businesses have fully reopened in the province, staffing trends are reflected in low sales numbers.
 New survey data by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business shows the number of businesses fully opened in the province rose from 44% to 57% in the past week, while sales numbers compared to normal jumped from 15% to 25%.
 But the latter figures continue to be poor and low revenues compared to this time last year are affecting how businesses can rehire staff.
 As a result, 39% of Manitoba's businesses reported Monday that they have fewer than three-quarters of their usual staffing for this time of year.
 "Some businesses like hair salons, and gyms don't have a defined path forward under Manitoba's draft Phase Three plan," said CFIB prairie director Jonathan Alward on Tuesday. "We need to ensure that all businesses have some direction so they can make important decisions now like whether or not to hire more staff, what inventory to buy, physical alterations to their space, or even just to close down entirely."
 Manitoba leads the way among reporting provinces in terms of percentage of businesses seeing normal sales figures, slightly ahead of New Brunswick, which leads the way in Canada with 67% of their small businesses fully reopened.
 Ontario is Canada's most closed economy with just 43% of its small businesses reopened.
 "This week marks a major milestone in Canada's economic recover with half of small businesses now fully open," said CFIB president Dan Kelly. "However, the share of those making normal sales remains very low. Only 30% of firms that are fully open report normal sales levels. This tells us that we have a long, long way to go before small firms are out of the woods."
 By sector, the hospitality industry -- restaurants, hotels, etc. -- continues to be hardest hit, with just 18% of those businesses fully open and with a paltry 7% of their normal sales.
 Arts and recreation, including gyms, isn't far behind at just 24% reporting being fully open and at just 6% of their normal sales for this time of year.
 The agriculture and construction industries are the most open sectors in Canada at 78% and 77%, respectively.
 Agriculture is seeing sales figures at 45% of normal revenues, the highest among sectors in the country.
 "I hope that revenues soon catch up to hiring needs to ensure as many Manitobans can get back to work as possible in the near future," Alward said. "The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program is helpful to many businesses but some don't qualify or are still facing cashflow challenges. The concern is that consumer confidence remains relatively weak and many businesses remain partially or entirely closed."

LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - As expected, we saw a few cooling showers around Tuesday afternoon and more may develop before sunset, but all will come to an end by just after sunset. Temperatures were warm again with highs reaching the low 90s, but heat indices were only a couple of degrees warmer thanks to slightly drier air. Temperatures will not drop much overnight with lows by Wednesday morning only reaching the upper 60s to low 70s along and north of I-10; at the coast it will be even warmer with lows in the mid to upper 70s! .Wednesday through Saturday will be very similar to Tuesday with temperatures reaching the low 90s during the afternoon and morning lows in the low 70s. A few very isolated showers cannot be ruled out, but the chance of rain is only 20% each afternoon. By the weekend and into early next week we may see a slight uptick in rain chances to 30%, but widespread significant rain still looks unlikely. And there will be no change in temperatures. .The tropics are quiet with no signs of anything developing close to home over the next 5 days. In fact, Sahara dust will move across the Atlantic and could reach our area next week.

Amarin’s first-quarter results, released in April, were positive. Net total revenue more than doubled year over year to a record level on the back of Vascepa prescription growth in the United States. Revenue increased 112% to $155 million, up from $73.3 million in the first quarter of last year.
 The company reported cash equivalents of $329 million in the first quarter, and liquid short-term and long-term investments of $213.2 million and $81.5 million respectively. Amarin trades in the United States as an American depositary receipt, which allows U.S. investors to trade stocks in foreign companies.
 ## New Diabetes Study
 Amarin’s sole drug, Vascepa, has been around in the United States since 2013 to treat high triglycerides. It consists of one active ingredient, icosapent ethyl (IPE), which is an Omega-3 fatty acid derived from fish oil. It is the only drug of its kind on the market.
 The company soared in the stock market last year when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of Vascepa as a secondary treatment for adults with high triglyceride levels. Taken with statins, Vascepa has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke, which are among the top killers of Americans.
 On Monday, Amarin said a new study shows Vascepa can significantly reduce cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes. The findings could help Amarin expand sales to a new class of patients.
 The study found Vascepa reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 23% in diabetic patients. Amarin says cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among type-2 diabetes patients. It’s a particular concern among diabetics with confirmed atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which is the build up of fats in artery walls.

"I wanted to have this sort of caring voice, this caring person talking to this girl that I had in my head, who was just roaming around, just walking around, who didn't have any place to stay."
 "I didn't even know it was going to be for a horror movie. I don't really like horror movies," she adds. "If I knew that, I probably would have been like, 'I don't want to do a song for a horror movie,' but it was interesting. Definitely.

 Late last month, officers were called for a bewildered young black bear which climbed up a tree in a Charleswood neighbourhood and spent all day there, causing quite a stir among residents as police and Conservation Officers tried to coax him down. One local witness even took to Twitter with the hashtags #CharleswoodBear and #CharlieTheBear, garnering plenty of reaction.
 The bear eventually left the tree and the area on its own without incident, officials said.

Coronavirus has meant Arsenal’s biggest problems, on and off the pitch, must now be faced down over a vanishingly small window this summer and the days when, back in March, the main storyline around a visit to the Etihad Stadium was the reunion between Arteta and Guardiola could hardly seem further away.
