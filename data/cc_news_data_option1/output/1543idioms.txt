In 1996, the United States began approving the powerful combination therapies to treat HIV and AIDS that came out of studies like the one my uncle was part of. It was a watershed moment for US activists (many of them marginalised gay men). But it should not have been only theirs. Patients across the developing world had also given their own blood, spinal fluid and sinew, to test and establish these therapies.
 For years, with the cover of western patent laws, drug companies priced medicines out of their reach. By 2000, when India’s Cipla Pharmaceuticals defied these patents to produce generic AIDS drugs that countries in the Global South could afford to purchase for their citizens, my uncle was long dead.
 The WHO’s declaration that Africa won’t be a testing ground for coronavirus vaccines ultimately overlooks a much bigger problem. What we really need is assurance that Africa will get any vaccine or treatment at the same time as any other region; and on terms which mean we can actually afford it.
 ﻿Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has stated that governments must “prepare to suspend and override patents”. Warning that companies might try to “profiteer” from COVID-19, Márcio da Fonseca, an MSF infectious disease advisor, has urged governments to “set the wheels in motion to override [patent] monopolies, so they can ensure the supply of affordable drugs and save more lives.”
 Rather than simply banning clinical trials in Africa, and excluding the continent from research, this is the solution that would have saved my uncle’s life.

The coronavirus pandemic has exposed "systemic weaknesses" in global health systems, the G20 said Monday, but there was no mention of Washington's contentious decision to halt World Health Organization funding.
 The statement came after health ministers from the 20 most advanced economies held a virtual meeting on Sunday hosted by the group's current president Saudi Arabia following criticism the institution was slow to address the pandemic.
 "Health Ministers recognised that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted systemic weaknesses in health systems," they said in a joint statement.
 "It also has shown vulnerabilities in the global community’s ability to prevent and respond to pandemic threats.
 "Ministers addressed the need to improve the effectiveness of global health systems by sharing knowledge and closing the gap in response capabilities and readiness."
 The worldwide death toll from the novel coronavirus pandemic rose to 164,016 on Sunday, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.
 More than 2,363,210 declared cases have been registered in 193 countries and territories since the epidemic first emerged in China in December.
 The novel coronavirus has upended the lives of billions of people as nations imposed lockdown measures to curb its spread, sending the global economy into a tailspin.
 The G20 statement was silent on US President Donald Trump's decision last week to cut off Washington's bilateral funding to the World Health Organization (WHO).
 Trump has accused the UN body of mishandling the coronavirus crisis.
 The US contributed $400 million to the WHO last year.
 United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has condemned the US suspension of funds, saying it was "not the time to reduce" the WHO's resources.
 The WHO remained "absolutely critical" in the global fight against the virus, he said.

Japanese medics are warning more must be done to prevent the coronavirus from overwhelming the country's healthcare system as confirmed cases passed 10,000, despite a nationwide state of emergency.
 Experts have been alarmed by a recent spike in COVID-19 infections, with hundreds detected daily.
 Japan's outbreak remains less severe than in hard-hit European countries, but its caseload is one of Asia's highest after China and India, and is roughly on par with South Korea.
 There have been 171 deaths recorded so far in Japan and 10,751 cases, with the country under a month-long state of emergency, initially covering seven regions but now in place nationwide.
 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has urged residents to reduce contact with other people by 70 to 80 percent, and the number of people on Tokyo's normally packed transport system has dropped significantly.
 But the measures do not prevent people from going out, and many shops and even restaurants remain open, even as medical associations warn the country's healthcare system is struggling to cope.
 "The system is on the verge of collapse in many places in Japan," said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious diseases specialist from Kobe University who has repeatedly criticised the government's response to the crisis.
 Speaking at a press briefing on Monday, Iwata said Japan's strategy of limited testing and intensive contact-tracing worked well in the initial phase of the local outbreak, when numbers were small.
 But he charged that Japan failed to adapt as the outbreak grew.
 "We needed to prepare for once the situation changes, once the cluster-chasing became not effective and we needed to change strategy immediately," he said.
 "But traditionally speaking, and historically speaking, Japan is not very good at changing strategy," he added.
 "We are very poor at even thinking of plan B because thinking of plan B is a sign of admitting failure of plan A."
 \- Not a 'worst-case scenario' -
 Japan's government argues it has adjusted its strategy, boosting testing capacity, changing rules that required all positive cases to remain in hospitals where wards quickly became full, and imposing the state of emergency to reduce the spread.
 But medical experts have called the measures insufficient.
 "Beds for novel coronavirus patients continue to be almost full," Haruo Ozaki, president of the Tokyo Medical Association, warned last week.
 The association has been increasing beds but with a large number of new cases coming in every day, "beds are being occupied instantly," he said.
 The health minister has acknowledged that hospitals have in some cases turned away suspected coronavirus patients in ambulances.
 "Japan hasn't built a system in which ordinary hospitals can take infectious disease patients in an emergency, when designated hospitals can't cope," Ozaki said on Friday.
 "We are doing our best... but infections are spreading faster than expected," he added.
 And hospitals are also struggling with equipment shortages, with the mayor of Osaka calling for donations of unused raincoats for health workers currently forced to use garbage bags for protective equipment.
 Both Iwata and Ozaki warned that the state of emergency now in place until at least May 6 was not sufficient.
 "While they talk about border controls and decreasing person-to-person contacts, they let stores stay open," Ozaki complained.
 Iwata said he was "half-encouraged and half-discouraged" by the infection numbers in Tokyo, which he called "relatively stable."
 "My biggest fear was the explosion of diagnoses... like in New York City, which didn't happen," he said.
 "These numbers are much better than the worst-case scenario."

Köstinger also left open when there could be a special regulation for tourists from Germany. “There is no deadline, there could be further waves of infection.

Köstinger said that there will of course be requirements such as distance and hygiene rules.

Two clients who the Illinois Innocence Project represented were released earlier this month by Gov. JB Pritzker.
 The most celebrated of the cases was Marilyn Mulero, who was sentenced to death in 1993 for her supposed role in the deaths of two men in the Humboldt Park area of Chicago.
 The Innocence Project is housed at the University of Illinois Springfield.
 Mulero was granted clemency by the governor. Her plight was featured in the 2019 theatrical release "Brian Banks."
 Carl Reed, who served 20 years behind bars, had his sentenced commuted by Pritzker. Reed, according to an Innocence Project post on Facebook, had extensive pre-existing health conditions that put him at high risk of death or serious illness if he contracted COVID-19 in prison.
