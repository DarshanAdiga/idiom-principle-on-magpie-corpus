Hypocrisy by men and women in high places is galling enough on its own. But the real risk is that double standards will melt into no standards at all. If my city's mayor decides to sidestep the rules — or even good sense — by having an indoor restaurant meal, or taking an out-of-town trip to see family, why shouldn't I do the same? Every person who decides to follow suit takes the chance of spreading the virus, and its accompanying misery, to a wider group of people.

The other difference between now and 2009 is that McConnell had solid control of his caucus back then. That's not so clearly the case right now — and it's specifically not the case if he appears to be making moves more out of fear of Trump than from a calculation of his party's best interests. McConnell recently shot down the latest attempt to find bi-partisan ground on coronavirus relief, but this is not the last round of that particular fight, and the mere fact that four Republican senators joined the effort shows the natives are getting restless. Most important, these senators have little reason to fear Trump's wrath: Mitt Romney of Utah already voted to convict Trump of charges for which he was impeached, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska already won re-election once after losing a Republican primary to a Tea-Party-backed challenger, and Susan Collins just won re-election in Maine by 9 points while Trump lost the state by the same margin. McConnell has very little leverage to keep them in line just out of fear of Trump's Twitter tirades.

Iowa’s problem is not that residents don’t _want_ to do the right thing, or that they have some kind of unique disregard for the health of their neighbors. Instead, they looked to elected leaders they trust to tell them how to navigate this crisis, and those leaders, including Trump and Reynolds, told them they didn’t need to do much at all. (Although some residents have certainly deliberately ignored the advice of public-health experts.) “When our strategies are not consistent with CDC evidence, when we are not adhering to even the advice of the White House task force, it raises questions in people’s minds on the seriousness of the pandemic and the validity of the mitigation strategies,” Lina Tucker Reinders, the executive director of the Iowa Public Health Association, told me. “People don’t necessarily know what the right thing to do is.”
 Which means that not only are health-care professionals tasked with saving sick Iowans’ lives, but it’s also fallen on them to communicate the truth about the pandemic.

They pour fewer wines and, in accordance with state COVID-19 guidance, if a bottle touches a glass that someone drank from, they dump that bottle. They now put an order form on every table so customers can fill out their name, car make, model and license plate and have any wine they purchase delivered to the trunk of their car by the time they leave.

The crisis in Iowa’s hospitals could be improved in a matter of weeks if Iowans started wearing a mask whenever they leave the house and stopped spending time indoors with people outside their households. But doctors posting diagrams to Facebook can do only so much, Gehlbach acknowledges. Without state leadership on board, none of those changes will happen. “The endgame of uncontrolled spread is a choice between massive death and suffering and overflowing hospitals, or shutting things down,” he said. “This is the equivalent [of] choosing between death or amputation—when you could have had an earlier surgery, which would have been painful but would have prevented this scenario from developing in the first place.”

CBS' Navy SEAL drama's two-hour season 4 premiere ended with Bravo One himself, Jason Hayes (David Boreanaz), leaving his post as team leader, forcing Bravo Team to have to fill some very big shoes. Jason's decision to take a backseat in field operations came after an intense conversation with Mandy Ellis (Jessica Pare), who, fed up with the never-ending cycle of chaos that comes with their high-stakes jobs, chose to get out after a particularly trying mission. For a minute, it didn't seem like Jason was ready to follow suit. But after rallying the team together at the bar, Jason announced he was ready to figure out what a life without gunfire and explosions meant for him.

When it first came out, D&D was the subject of intense social stigma. It's hard for modern audiences to really understand on a visceral level, but nerdy fantasy stuff like this was deeply uncool or even feared back in those days, mocked and shamed by the hegemonic culture. It was collateral damage in the 1980s Satanic panic — blamed for suicides or murders by irresponsible journalists caught up in a moralistic feeding frenzy. (A 1985 _60 Minutes_ segment on the topic is hilariously unhinged.) Even in the 1990s and 2000s, it was still considered low-status compared to sports or even marching band.

KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) - A 17-year-old Illinois man accused of killing two men during an August protest in Wisconsin faces a preliminary hearing in the case. Hearings such as the one Thursday in Kenosha are generally used to determine whether enough evidence exists to proceed to a trial. Kyle Rittenhouse is charged with homicide and attempted homicide in the shootings. They came during a night of unrest in Kenosha following the police shooting two days earlier of Jacob Blake, a Black man. Rittenhouse is free on $2 million bond largely provided by supporters who see him as a patriot who was trying to protect other people’s property. Others view him as a trigger- happy youth whose presence with a rifle incited protesters.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
