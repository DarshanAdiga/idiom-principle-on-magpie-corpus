Clemson coach Dabo Swinney famously said it was a BYOG game: "Bring your own guts." The Tigers needed to back pack some guts and then some for the their first trip to South Bend since 1979.
 Not only were the Tigers missing Lawrence, but three key defensive starters were out with injuries.
 "We didn't win the game, but you saw what this team is made of," Swinney said. "This team is made of the right stuff."

The Ricebirds rushed out to a two-score lead after a bad Needville punt and a penalty gave them the ball on the nine-yard line. Four plays later, junior Johntre Davis scored from one yard out.
 Needville trailing two scores, on their next possession put together a drive that brought them near the red zone. On second and seven, from the 30-yard line, Baker threw the ball long. The Ricebirds brought pressure and his pass was short allowing Owens to pick off the throw in the endzone.
 El Campo senior quarterback Cullen Braden wasted no time with the gift of an extra possession. Braden on the quarterback keeper hit the outside and scampered into the endzone from 80-yards away putting them up 20-0.
 Needville chipped away at El Campo’s lead and made things interesting in the second half. Trailing 27-7, Needville used a couple of quick passes and scored to make it a two-score game.
 A tight game evaporated once Owens got going in the second half. The sophomore juked his way through the Bluejay defense for a 43-yard score in the third quarter and a 74-yard touchdown in the fourth to put the game away.
 “They started to come back towards the end, we slipped a little bit on defense,” Owens said. “We picked it back up and scored again and it was game over. I’m really excited. We might be a young (team) but we’ve got a lot of potential to make it far.”
 The playoffs start next week and the Ricebirds will play someone from District 11. However, they do not know their first-round match up.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - Joe Biden used his first national address as president-elect to vow to heal a deeply divided nation, declaring it was time to “let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end” and reaching out to the millions of people who voted against him to say, “Let’s give each other a chance.”His calls for reconciliation at a Saturday evening victory celebration came even as President Donald Trump continued to argue that the election had been stolen from him, an indication that the divisive politics that have gripped the U.S. over the past four years are far from over. It also suggested that even as Biden seeks to build out a government during his transition to the presidency, the president has little interest in helping him do so. “For all those of you who voted for President Trump, I understand the disappointment,” Biden said during a drive-in event in Wilmington, Delaware. “It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again.”President-elect Joe Biden addresses the nation in victory speech and says he's humbled by the supportBiden heads into his first full day as president-elect on Sunday with key staffing decisions to make as the coronavirus rages. The always-frenzied 10-week transition period before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 already has been shortened by the extra time it took to determine the winner of Tuesday’s election. The second Catholic to be elected president, Biden planned to attend church at St. Joseph on the Brandywine near his home in Wilmington, as he does nearly every week. He began Election Day with a visit to the church and the grave of his son, Beau, a former Delaware attorney general who died of brain cancer in 2015.His top priority in the transition is expected to be quickly naming a chief of staff. Biden suggested during the campaign that his first call after being elected would be to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, but his advisers have not said whether the two have spoken yet. Biden said Saturday that he would announce a task force of scientists and experts Monday to develop a “blueprint” to begin beating back the virus by the time he assumes the presidency. He said his plan would be “built on bedrock science” and “constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern.” Biden was on track to win the national popular vote by more than 4 million, a margin that could grow as ballots continue to be counted. He made Trump the first incumbent president to be denied a second term since Republican George H.W. Bush lost to Bill Clinton in 1992.His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, used her first address as vice president-elect to showcase her history-make place as the first Black woman to become vice president, an achievement that comes as the U.S. faces a reckoning on racial justice. The California senator is also the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency and the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in government. “While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,” Harris said in her speech Saturday night. Harris encourages girls to see possibilities.To win, Biden successfully unified different wings of the Democratic Party around their universal loathing of Trump, garnering support from progressive insurgents and establishment moderates alike. “The party came together to defeat Donald Trump,” said Brian Lemek, a longtime progressive fundraiser and executive director of Brady PAC, which invested $6 million on 2020 candidates supporting gun violence prevention efforts and voting rights. “His main job right now, we all think, is to heal the nation.” Biden senior adviser Ted Kaufman said the transition team will focus on the “nuts and bolts” of building the new administration in coming days. He said Biden plans to speak to legislative leaders and governors from both parties.Biden may not make top Cabinet choices for weeks. But he built his presidential run around bipartisanship and he has spent the days since Tuesday’s election pledging to be a president for all Americans. That suggests he could be willing to appoint some Republicans to high-profile administration positions. Many former Republican officeholders broke with Trump to endorse Biden’s campaign. His selection of some of them to join the new government could appease Senate Republicans, who may have to confirm many of Biden’s choices for top jobs. The GOP could retain control of the chamber after two special elections in Georgia on Jan. 5. Still, too much across-the-aisle cooperation could draw the ire of progressives. Some already worry that uncooperative Senate Republicans could force Biden to scale back his ambitious campaign promises to expand access to health care and lead a post-pandemic economic recovery that relies on federal investment in green technology and jobs to help combat climate change. “I think there will be a huge misuse of the word ‘unity’ to imply that we need to water down the ideas that Joe Biden just campaigned on,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. He said the country was more united around bold solutions to big problems than small-scale efforts to appease moderates in both parties. Biden’s efforts at bipartisan reconciliation, meanwhile, could still be derailed by Trump’s refusing to concede the presidential race. It wasn’t clear if Biden and Trump would meet in coming days, as is the modern tradition. Biden campaign spokeswoman Symone Sanders said, “Donald Trump does not get to decide the winner of elections.”“The people decide, voters in the country decide,” Sanders said. “And voters have made their choice very clear.”Some of the president’s supporters used similar language to make the opposite argument. “The media do not get to determine who the president is. The people do,” tweeted Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. “When all lawful votes have been counted, recounts finished, and allegations of fraud addressed, we will know who the winner is.”___AP National Political Writer Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

As a result of stark contrast in consumer behavior and stringent regulations across the world pertaining to transportation during the pandemic, the global packaging sector is going through a turbulent phase. This is expected to reflect in the growth of the Lawn and Leaf Bags market, as operations are limited to essential activities and products, thereby creating a huge void in packaging needs for non-essential commodities. On this premise, the global Lawn and Leaf Bags market will experience a downtrend through the pandemic. Further complicating smooth operations are hindered operations and travel bans across the world. On the back of these factors, players operating in the global Lawn and Leaf Bags market are expected to experience a steep decline in revenue flow.

 As much as the number still will produce howls about voter disenfranchisement, the fact is the number represents a smaller percentage than those rejected four years ago for the same reason when there was no court fight to confuse voters. In 2016, just under 1,600 mailed absentee ballots were returned without a witness signature, out of 133,000 total, meaning 1.2% of all returned absentee ballots weren’t counted for that reason.
 S.C. Election Commission spokesman Chris Whitmore told The Post and Courier of Charleston that if there’s a silver lining to the court case, it’s the “bright light” shone on the signature requirement.
 “There’s been more attention to the witness signature than ever before,” he said. “Not to discount that people might’ve been confused. But on the other hand, the attention received has to have some positive effect on educating voters.”

A handful of journalists were evacuated from Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorna-Karabkah, on Saturday as shelling increased around the city. Video on Sunday showed civilians fleeing the fighting. For almost a month and a half fighting has taken place between Azerbaijan and Armenian forces in Nagorna- Karabakh. The territory is administered by Armenians and is supposed to be an autonomous region inside Azerbaijan, but the recent dispute has led to Azerbaijan trying to take control of it from Armenian forces.  
 For those on the ground the military dispute has been harrowing. Tens of thousands have fled fighting with civilians shelled on both sides. However, in recent weeks Azerbaijan forces have made gains. After initial slow progress in October, the forces now appear poised to take key civilian areas, such as Shusha and even Stepanakert.  
 Azerbaijan has benefited from massive support from Turkey, including Turkish drones, as well as drones that it purchased from Israel over the years. It has used drones to devastating effect against the Russian-supplied equipment that Armenia went to war with, neutralizing most of the air defenses of the Artsakh Republic, the area that Armenian claims and controls. Russia, Turkey and Iran have watched the fighting but all of them have been happy to let it grind on. Attempts by Moscow to broker a ceasefire failed and the US attempts also failed. The US has shown little interest in the conflict.  
 The conflict has also led to tensions between Israel and Armenia, as Armenians have accused Israel of supplying Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has been a key partner of Israel, a strategic relationship built on decades of friendship. Iran is wary of the fighting near its border. Turkey has sent Syrian extremist mercenaries to fight Armenia. Russia has done the usual of trying to weaken all sides to force the to come to Moscow to partition the area.
 This is what Moscow did in Libya and Syria, it ends up cutting a deal with Turkey and getting everyone to be dependent on Russia. Clearly Armenia has now seen that it will eventually lose and it now needs Russia more than ever. Turkey also needs Russia because it is buying the S-400 air defense from Russia. While US President-elect Joe Biden was celebrating yesterday the Turkish far-right leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan was speaking with Russia's Vladimir Putin about dividing Nagorna-Karabakh. Turkey's AK Party was a keen supporter of US President Donald Trump. Erdogan had more calls with Trump than almost any foreign leader. Turkey's foreign ministry also slandered and threatened Biden over the last six months. Now Turkey knows its friends are in Russia and it will work with Russia to sort out the conflict in the Caucasus.  
 In Stepanakert locals showed images of widespread damage from shelling. People are begging the international community and the US to do something. They claim that ethnic-cleansing of Armenians could take place. Already churches have been shelled and many have fled. Azerbaijan responds that Armenia has also used rockets to strike cities like Ganja, harming and killing civilians. Like most war, there is no purity here.
 Pro-Turkey and pro-Azerbaijan social media are celebrating, telling Armenians to "leave immediately." Azerbaijan Telegram accounts reportedly celebrated "chasing the dogs" out of the city. Locals report rockets falling on the city and heavy shelling. Azerbaijan social media accounts claim the town of Shusha, sometimes spelled Shushi, was already "liberated" on Sunday during fighting. For those in Baku the images of Armenians fleeing conjure up images from the 1990s of Azeris fleeing fighting in the same area. The argument is that after decades this has come full circle.
 The reality is a bit different because this area was once diverse and today it appears it can only be one group or the other controlling it and living there, much like the ethnic cleansing wars off the Balkans in the 1990s. Life is already shattered in Nagorna-Karabakh from a month of fighting, and the international community has done nothing to stop it or t help the civilians who have fled.  
 Russia's Tass media says Turkey is ready to talk about a permanent solution to the conflict. Iran supports Baku's demands that Armenia withdraw. Turkey and Russia appear ready to partition the area and get the spoils. It's unclear how many civilians may have fled, 50,000 or 100,000 could be the numbers. Considering Turkey already ethnically cleansed Afrin in Syria, expelling 150,000 Kurds in 2018, the expulsion of all these people will not gain the kind of sympathy of the 1990 shown to people in the Balkans. Stepanakert once had a population of 50,000 people. It's unclear how many remain. For Azerbaijan however this is a major victory they have waited for after decades, with memories of their own defeat in Susha in 1992 still present.
