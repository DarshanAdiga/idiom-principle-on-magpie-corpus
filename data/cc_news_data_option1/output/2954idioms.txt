Trump‚Äôs social media order was introduced and signed days after Twitter applied a warning label to his tweets that said they were ‚Äúpotentially misleading.‚Äù Twitter highlighted two of Trump‚Äôs tweets that claimed, without evidence, that mail-in voting would lead to widespread voter fraud.

Paisley Nahanee is longing for those exhilarating club nights, the ones where bumping into a few old friends on the dance floor wasn't considered a health risk.
 But when the disc jockey and event organizer throws a couple parties at Vancouver's pride festivities this weekend, nobody will be making close encounters beneath the disco light, under orders from British Columbia health officials.
 "This is going be really different," Nahanee said of two physically distanced Level Up! events that are restricted to outdoor seating of 50 people at the Clubhouse bar.
 The parties are billed as "not quite like last year, but with the same spirit," and without an overflowing dance floor it'll certainly feel scaled down.
 Instead of crowds numbering in the hundreds, guests can reserve tickets for up to six of their friends on the patio. Together, they'll congregate in their circle ‚Äî or "pod" ‚Äî for a two-hour window before making way for the next round of partiers. It's regimented, but for Nahanee, at least it's happening.
 "Partygoers just have to change their expectations," she said.
 "You're not going to meet any new friends."
 A province-wide ban on dance floors went into effect last week after a number of COVID-19 cases linked to bars and clubs raised concerns over close contact. The move dealt another blow to the crippled local club industry that's struggled to reopen in the midst of the pandemic.
 Club operators in B.C. aren't alone either. Any bar or venue with a dance floor as a draw might be forced to rethink how they operate with no end to COVID-19 in sight. In Toronto, large venues remain closed, while in Montreal nightclubs are back in business without dance floors and with limited capacity.
 Morgan Deane, a New York-based expert in the clubbing industry, has called for a widespread reckoning with the future of nightlife.
 "Everyone's still operating in this modality of when COVID is over, everything will go back to normal," she said.
 "Things are not going back to normal."
 Deane, who's spent more than 15 years helping launch new venues and run electronic music festivals, wants to see club owners stop seeking temporary fixes and instead look at "completely reimagining" their business.
 Her online guide "A Light in the Night" serves as a roadmap for small clubs hoping to reopen during the pandemic. It compiles illustrations of suggested venue layouts alongside best practices made in consultation with industry professionals and health experts.
 The guide's encourages standard practices, such as enhanced cleaning and wearing masks, as well as mandatory temperature checks for all staff.

Christine N. Matesich Zanesville - Christine N. Matesich died July 25, 2020 at her home. Born to Arthur and Gertrude (Trudy) Meissner in Toledo, Ohio October 18, 1945, Mrs. Matesich is survived by her husband John whom she married September 9, 1969, their daughters Jennifer (David) Gran, Katherine, and her very special grandson, Benjamin Reid Gran. She is also survived by her aunt Laurie Happ and cousins in Texas, Florida, New York and Toledo, Ohio. She was preceded in death by her parents, and by her sister Linda. Chris was an inspiring and dedicated mother and grandmother, and a special friend to her daughters, husband and grandson. While she always avoided the spotlight in her endeavors, she was an outgoing and beautiful person, whose personality radiated interest in those she met. A graduate of The University of Toledo in Education, she was a genuine and effective educator, whose love of teaching whether young children or adults, always involved more than just the subject. She truly loved the students to whom she was entrusted, and helped them to succeed and overcome whatever hurdles they imagined or incurred in their life while under her care. She was also a community volunteer in organizations, giving her time and talent to a wide variety of interests, usually the underserved, vulnerable, or avoided. Her commitment to an organization and service was full and complete, not just interested in lending her name to a cause. She worked diligently and passionately and while exhibiting a gentle personality, was able to deal with tough and difficult board issues honestly, effectively and directly. She possessed a keen sense of the beauty in the visual world, and her observations were typical of a deeper artistic sense. While having little business education other than her work in her early years in retail while in high school and college, her intuition about the small business she helped establish was usually 'spot on'. She fostered team work before it was a buzz word and her practical sense of right and wrong, served her successfully in her interactions with her customers. Her daughters thought of her as a trailblazer, who worked summers on the East Coast, paid her way through college, flew for American Airlines while living in Chicago, and started a business while in her sixties. These were just a few of the markers of her creative mindset and positive attitude that helped her achieve beyond what was expected. She will be missed by her friends and family because of her kindness, humor, and genuine care for them as persons. Loyal and steadfast, her word was her bond, and character unquestioned. She will be sadly missed by those who knew her well, and others she merely touched by her acquaintance. Her extended family was as important to her as her children, and she treasured the life long memories of them by how she lived her own life from their lessons. According to her wishes, Chris will be cremated and her ashes spread over the land and sea she loved. A private family service and memorial Service will be held this week. To send an online condolence please visit www.hilliscombsnestor.com. Memorial contributions may be made to the local charity of one's choice or to the Muskingum County Animal Shelter in her name.

LOUDONILLE -- Jim Kimnach of Columbus, a member of the Society of American Baseball Research, offered members of the Rotary Club of Loudonville an entertaining view of America's pastime at the July 16 meeting.  


  Kimnach, who taught high school math for 44 years, associated with SABR as an extension to a lifelong love of the sport, including coaching his kids in youth ball, and being a dedicated fan of the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds and Columbus Clippers.  


  In the empty no-baseball world of Covid-19 America, he admitted to watching Korean Baseball on ESPN as an outlet.  


  SABR gives him another outlet, and his involvements have included extensive reading of books on baseball, both fiction and true, and baseball movies. He also relishes following baseball podcasts, on sites such as Baseball by the Book, Starkville and SABR Cast.  


  "The most fun is baseball history, and trivia," he said.  


  "For instance, did you know that while the first baseball game was played in 1842, there wasn't a baseball box score kept until 1857?" he queried. "And in the first box scores, runs and outs were recorded, as well as the kind of out, fly ball, ground ball, foul ball and strikeout, but hits were not recorded, or RBI."  


  In early baseball, if a pitcher hit a batter, the poor batter just had to wait for the next pitch, he added, "a definite advantage to an aggressive pitcher."  


  In early baseball, the baseball was "dead," Kimnach said, "in that when it was hit, there weren't many home runs. But by the time of Babe Ruth, the ball was livened up a little, and there were lots more homers."  


  Regarding baseball history, Kimnach reported that "Joe Nuxhall, longtime pitcher and later broadcaster for the Reds, was the youngest pitcher to play in the major leagues, coming in for relief for the Reds and pitching two- thirds of an inning when he was just an eighth-grader. He got hit pretty hard that day, but kept pitching and returned to the majors a few years later, recording a 135-117 lifetime record, and 3.90 ERA, mostly for the Reds."  


  His historical research touched on one Rotarian, the club president, Brian Hartzell, who had an ancestor, Roy Hartzell, who played third base for the New York Yankees. "In 1913," Kimnach said, "he set a major league record by driving in eight runs in the same game, a record that was not broken for 22 years."  


  Kimnach was asked if he would like to see any rule changes in Major League Baseball, and he immediately recommended "a pitch clock. The game is way too slow, and moving pitchers along would help."  


  He was more dubious about new rule changes, including one that will be implemented this season where if a game goes into extra innings, as each team comes up to bat a runner is placed on second base. "I think that is too radical," he said. "Play the extras like the rest of the game."  


  He also is very much against the designated hitter rule.  


  Asked for a prediction on the upcoming 60-game season, he noted "it's wide open. With that few a number of games, it's anybody's season. I see the Reds as potential winners in the National League because they have solid starting pitching and a great hitting outfield which will be more lethal with the addition of designated hitting in the NL. In the American League, the Indians have a chance because of great pitching and Francisco Lindor. If they can keep Lindor, they will always be in contention. They have to, however, avoid a bad start. With only 60 games, there are no second chances."

The fencing was erected in February of 2019 after numerous complaints about people getting in the pool surrounding the fountain ‚Äî and going so far as to swim in it, or wash their clothes. Entering the pool is not considered safe. Electric shock and debris (including broken glass and hypodermic needles) on the floor of the fountain have often been mentioned as potential risks.


  On the other hand, the fountain in front of the Pulaski County Judicial Center a short distance away from the fountain on the square is open to the public to use. Kids frequently run through and play in the water,, especially at events like Somernites.


  In the time of COVID-19, when people are cautious about what they touch or how they come into contact with others, is playing in the Judicial Center Plaza fountain considered safe?


  Price says the county government works to make it so.


  "We do put heightened chemicals in it and clean it regularly," he said. "We do have kids from time to time wading it it, so we keep chemicals in it to help with any precaution as far as the public using it. I stay in contact with the (City of Somerset) because I look at it as another cooling station. What we do, we do in accordance with what (Somerset) is doing ‚Äî more chlorine and things of that nature."


  Price said that when an event is coming up that might use the plaza ‚Äî something that's occurred less frequently this year, due to the COVID-19 restrictions ‚Äî they'll shut the fountain down earlier (say, on Thursday for a Saturday event) and do an especially thorough cleaning before turning it back on.

The 28 runs is a Northwoods League record. The Rivets had 19 hits in the game and they benefited from 16 bases on balls. Leading the hit parade was third baseman Jeff Heinrich (University of South Carolina) with four hits including a home run. Jake Vader Wal added three hits and a home run. The Rivets scored runs in every inning except the eighth inning. They erupted for nine runs in the fourth inning.      In their previous three games the Rivets had scored a total of four runs. So what was the difference Sunday?      "Me and the boys shook things up in the clubhouse, and I'm just gonna leave it at that," said Henrich.      "We uh, didn't hit BP yesterday as crazy as it sounds,' said Vander Wal. "We mixed it up a little bit. You know, we're usually out here doing early work every day, doing all our stuff, and (manager Josh Keim) wanted to give us a break. For better or worse baseball's a weird game. Sometimes that's just the change you need."      "That's special," said Keim of the 28 runs. "For not just these guys, but for our organization to be in the record book."

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) ‚Äî Malaysian authorities have found 26 Rohingya Muslims hiding on a northern islet after they were initially feared drowned after jumping off a fishing boat. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency began searching after a Rohingya migrant found Saturday on the islet off Langkawi told investigators that at least 24 others were missing. The agency says rescuers found 26 other Rohingya hiding on the islet on Sunday. The agency believes local fishermen transported the migrants from a main vessel at sea so they could try to sneak into Malaysia undetected. Malaysia has been a common destination for Rohingya living in refugee camps after fleeing Myanmar.

Bad Marriage was red hot. The original rock 'n' roll outfit was packing rooms, selling plenty of merch, growing its fan-base and, in February, touring cross- country with multi-platinum '80s rockers Tesla.
 "This was our second big support slot opening for Tesla across the country," Bad Marriage's lead guitarist Mike "Fitzy" Fitz, of Milford, said. "We were definitely gaining steam and gaining traction coming off of that."
 Then, in mid-March, everything turned ice cold for Bad Marriage (and everybody else in the music industry) due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Bad Marriage had booked a series of hometown shows, a few more Tesla dates (in Peoria, Illinois, and Wichita, Kansas), a show with former Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee in New Bedford, Laconia Motorcycle Week in Laconia, New Hampshire, and, in September, an opening slot for Krokus at the Palladium in Worcester, all of which have been canceled due to the coronavirus.
 And, on top of that, Bad Marriage was hoping to double the number of dates already booked.
 "It is not just Bad Marriage that came to a screeching halt. It's everybody," Fitz said. "That's what we continuously have to keep reminding ourselves."
 "It wasn't like we got taken out of the race. There was no race," Bad Marriage's singer Johnny Paquin added. "It's not like anyone got any advantage or disadvantage. It went down to point zero, which means everybody, everybody had to deal with the sudden change in lifestyle."
 In addition to Milford's Fitz, and Paquin of Worcester, Bad Marriage consists of guitarist Ian Haggerty of Attleboro, bassist Todd Boisvert of Medway and drummer Michael Delaney of Milford. One of their last shows in the area was at Rascals in Worcester and it was packed to the rafters.
 Approaching four months, Bad Marriage couldn't play out and, for a bulk of those months, couldn't even practice.
 "For the first couple of months our actual practice facility was closed," Fitz said. "Even if we did get the green light to be around each other and practice, which we didn't for a while, our building wasn't even opened up yet."
 Fitz and Paquin started emailing back and forth with song ideas. As a result, Bad Marriage almost has a full record of new material ready to go.
 "A lot of folks don't realize it's not just about live concerts for us. In fact, I would say the most important part of Fitzy and my relationship is the songwriting and tracking process," Paquin said. "Our songwriting has been so fruitful over the last few months. It has been really astonishing. Quite a blessing, I would say."
 While we're talking classic, kick-ass rock 'n' roll one would expect from Bad Marriage, fans might be surprised at the themes permeating under the heavy riffs and the kicking backbeats in songs of late.
 "Obviously, all the negative, confusing thoughts that have been going through our heads are coming out. I can almost sense the melancholy in Fitzy's music that he's been writing lately and that resonates with me," Paquin said. "So, I'm naturally writing things that are asking questions of my own ‚Ä¶ What is life? I'm not George Harrison or anything, but when you have time for real introspection, you come up with some surprising answers."
 With the shutdown, Fitz and Paquin said they learned how loyal their diehard fans are.
 "It's more of a family than a fan base. When times are clear, we hang out at each other's houses for barbecues and stuff. We know each other as family. This is the real deal. These are real relationships with real people with a lot to add to each other's life," Paquin said. "It's a rich group of people that we consider to be our fan base. It's almost like they do the work for us."
 In the heart of the pandemic, Bad Marriage released a new song, "Together," a hard-rocking, neo-hippie, borderline peaceful protest song.
 "The overall message of the song about getting united and getting together is very relevant and fitting for now," Fitz said. "This song needs to come out because if it can help people cope with what's going on, let's do it."
 While the song seems perfect for the time, "Together" was actually recorded back in August, way before the coronavirus pandemic and the "Black Lives Matters" protests.
 "First of all, I'm not a fortune teller. I didn't travel time. It just happens to be how I was feeling or what world I was living in when my songwriting head or my poem writing head while the song was going on around me," Paquin said. "And I just spat that stuff out and Brian (Wheat) kicked in with a certain part of the chorus and Fitzy helped with the verses and bam! It was done."
 Recorded in Sacramento, California, "Together" was produced and co-written by Tesla's bassist, songwriter and co-founder Brian Wheat.
 "Brian's taken us under his wing. He seems to really dig Bad Marriage," Fitz said. "We spent some time together, being on tour for a couple of months. My God, we've done almost 30 shows with them."
 Bad Marriage planned to out to Sacramento to record four more songs for a five-song EP (which will include "Together") with Wheat producing and co- writing.
 Also during the pandemic, Bad Marriage's one-year deal with Fanatics to use the band's catchy crowd-pleaser "Nay-Sayin' Blues" in a series of TV commercial spots has been extended for an additional six months through the end of the year.
 "It's very cool," Fitz said. "Fanatics has been a huge help and it has been a lot of exposure for us to have that song on all the commercials."
 If that wasn't enough, Bad Marriage is also working on another album with Fitz producing.
 With 20 brand spanking new songs to choose from (and none of which have been played out live), fans can expect the band's sophomore album to be another healthy platter of hard-rocking tunes that has become synonymous with the band, at the same time, showing a progression of growth in musicianship and songwriting, Fitz and Paquin said.
 "Most if not all of the songs were written after the whole lockdown. Our main problem is we have so much music to put out," Fitz said. "We're trying to stay creative, keep busy, engage with our fans and just keep writing. And, hopefully, sooner or later, we can get back on the road because that's where we've found our most success."

While NDDC Director, Corporate affairs, Charles Odili explained that Pondei had been ill before appearing at the panel, the believability of such claim is watery when one considers the bizarre coincidence between the moment of slumping and the questions of spending asked by the panellists. In essence, many of these performances follow the same pattern of deceitful display of ill-health to buy time and get more opportunity to negotiate soft landing, frustrate investigation, appeal to human rights community, and ultimately delay justice. There is danger when pretence is deployed as an escape strategy and deceit is used as survivalist strategy. It has implication for socialising the succeeding generation to embrace deceitful living (Hushpuppism), legitimising the grabbing of what belongs to the majority for oneself without caring how that affects the life chances of others.

  MIAMI, July 27 (Reuters) - As the coronavirus ravages Florida, healthcare workers in Miami hospitals are struggling to cope with the emotional and physical impact of treating a crushing wave of COVID-19 patients.


  After seeing 10,000 new cases a day become the norm across the state in July, many of those on the frontlines are frustrated with the apparent inability of local, state, and federal governments to coordinate an adequate response. They are equally aghast with what appears to be the reluctance or refusal of many Floridians to honor safety precautions to stop the spread of coronavirus.


  "I know, and my colleagues know, that we're putting a Band-Aid on a problem, we're supporting people as best we can to get them through, but the real fight happens outside," said Dr. Eric Knott, a pulmonary and critical care fellow working in three of Miami's largest hospitals. "If you can't stop the spread, all of my work is for nothing."


  For Miami doctors, concerns about the virus far surpass those stirred up by even the largest hurricanes.


  "A hurricane tends to be a sort of finite amount, and this is infinite," said Dr. Mark Supino, an attending physician in Jackson Memorial Hospital's emergency department.


  Many healthcare workers and union leaders were critical of Miami's reopening several weeks after the number of cases of the novel coronavirus first began rising in early March.


  On Friday, state health officials reported a total of 402,312 cases across Florida, with 135 new deaths bringing the total to more than 5,600.


  While the death toll in South Florida has not approached that of New York City, an early epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, hospital beds and intensive care units across the region have filled to capacity, and in some cases surpassed it.


  At Jackson Memorial Hospital, the largest facility in the region, officials have called in hundreds of additional medical workers as employees have fallen sick and had to stay home or be hospitalized. An auditorium was sealed and prepared for COVID-positive patients with a negative pressure system to limit the air flow to prevent new infections.


  "In 10 years of medicine I never had to put another nurse on life support, I never had to worry about my co-workers dying," said Kevin Cho Tipton, a critical care nurse practitioner who works at one of Miami's largest public hospitals. "It's been emotionally very challenging, physically very challenging."


  Among the most difficult and stressful parts of the job are the sheer number of ICU patients.


  Healthcare workers must constantly keep tabs on the vital organs of patients on ventilators, and many of the sick have to be flipped over and over again to stave off any complications from lying in one position for a prolonged period. To do so without risking detaching any of the life support systems can take up to six people.


  The intensity has overwhelmed some.


  Jude Derisme, vice president of Service Employees International Union 1199, which represents 25,000 medical workers across Florida, said the union had to help get one nurse, a 25-year veteran, off a hospital floor after a "break down."


  "My fear is that if we don't find a way to bring these numbers down over the next two weeks, if they're worse than these last two weeks, we're going to be stretched too thin," said Martha Baker, a registered nurse and president of Service Employees International Union 1991, which represents about 5,600 medical professionals within Miami's Jackson Health System. "The sad news is that that's when patients die."


  While her chapter of the union along with others across Florida have advocated for more personal protective equipment, better overtime pay, hazard pay, and worker's compensation for those waylaid by the virus, they also acknowledged that medical workers can only do so much against the pandemic.


  "This is war, and instead of bullets we've got viruses," Baker said. "If we don't find a way to dampen our curve we just keep chasing our tails." (Reporting by Zachary Fagenson in Miami; Editing by Frank McGurty and Tom Brown)

All around the world, the coronavirus and its restrictions are pushing already hungry communities over the edge, cutting off meager farms from markets and isolating villages from food and medical aid. Virus-linked hunger is leading to the deaths of 10,000 more children a month over the first year of the pandemic, according to an urgent call to action from the United Nations shared with The Associated Press ahead of its publication in the Lancet medical journal.


  Further, more than 550,000 additional children each month are being struck by what is called wasting, according to the U.N. ‚Äî malnutrition that manifests in spindly limbs and distended bellies. Over a year, that's up 6.7 million from last year's total of 47 million. Wasting and stunting can permanently damage children physically and mentally, transforming individual tragedies into a generational catastrophe.


  "The food security effects of the COVID crisis are going to reflect many years from now," said Dr. Francesco Branca, the World Health Organization head of nutrition. "There is going to be a societal effect."

  In Burkina Faso, for example, one in five young children is chronically malnourished. Food prices have spiked, and 12 million of the country's 20 million residents don't get enough to eat.


  Lanizou's husband, Yakouaran Boue, used to sell onions to buy seeds and fertilizer, but then the markets closed. Even now, a 50-kilogram bag of onions sells for a dollar less, which means less seed to plant for next year.

  From Latin America to South Asia to sub-Saharan Africa, more families than ever are staring down a future without enough food. The analysis published Monday found about 128,000 more young children will die over the first 12 months of the virus.


  In April, World Food Program head David Beasley warned that the coronavirus economy would cause global famines "of biblical proportions" this year. There are different stages of what is known as food insecurity; famine is officially declared when, along with other measures, 30% of the population suffers from wasting.


  The agency estimated in February that one in every three people in Venezuela was already going hungry, as inflation rendered many salaries nearly worthless and forced millions to flee abroad. Then the virus arrived.


  "The parents of the children are without work," said Annelise Mirabal, who works with a foundation that helps malnourished children in Maracaibo, the city in Venezuela thus far hardest hit by the pandemic. "How are they going to feed their kids?"


  These days, many new patients are the children of migrants who are making long journeys back to Venezuela from Peru, Ecuador or Colombia, where their families became jobless and unable to buy food during the pandemic. Others are the children of migrants who are still abroad and have not been able to send back money for more food.


  "Every day we receive a malnourished child," said Dr. Francisco Nieto, who works in a hospital in the border state of Tachira. He added that they look "like children we haven't seen in a long time in Venezuela," alluding to those in famines in parts of Africa.


  In May, Nieto recalled, after two months of quarantine in Venezuela, 18-month-old twins arrived at his hospital with bodies bloated from malnutrition. The children's mother was jobless and living with her own mother. She told the doctor she had only been able to feed them a simple drink made with boiled bananas.


  "Not even a cracker? Some chicken?" he asked.


  "Nothing," the children's grandmother responded.


  When doctors tried to treat them, one of the boys developed "refeeding syndrome," where food can result in metabolic abnormalities. Eight days later, he died.


  Nieto said aid groups have provided some relief, but their work has been limited by COVID-19 quarantines. A home set up in Tachira to receive malnourished children after they are released from the hospital is no longer in operation. So now children are sent directly back to their families, many of whom are still unable to feed them properly.


  "It's very frustrating," Nieto said. "The children get lost."

  The rise in child deaths worldwide would reverse global progress for the first time in decades. Deaths of children younger than 5 had declined steadily since 1980, to 5.3 million around the world in 2018, according to a UNICEF report. About 45 percent of the deaths were due to undernutrition.


  The leaders of four international agencies ‚Äî the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization ‚Äî have called for at least $2.4 billion immediately to address hunger. Even more than the money, restrictions on movement need to be eased so that families can seek treatment, said Victor Aguayo, the head of UNICEF's nutrition program.


  "By having schools closed, by having primary health care services disrupted, by having nutritional programs dysfunctional, we are also creating harm," Aguayo said. He cited as an example the near-global suspension of Vitamin A supplements, which are a crucial way to bolster developing immune systems.


  In Afghanistan, restrictions on movement prevent many families from bringing their malnourished children to hospitals for food and aid just when they need it most. The Indira Gandhi hospital in the capital, Kabul, has seen only three or four malnourished children, said specialist Nematullah Amiri.

  July 27 (Reuters) - Just four days after beginning a truncated coronavirus- delayed season, Major League Baseball encountered a serious obstacle on Monday with the postponement of games scheduled in Miami and Philadelphia due to COVID-19-related concerns.


  The Miami Marlins, who opened their season on Friday in Philadelphia, were scheduled to return home on Sunday ahead of their scheduled Monday home opener but put off traveling after a number of their players tested positive for the virus.


  The Philadelphia Phillies were scheduled to host the New York Yankees on Monday but that game also was postponed as the Marlins players were recently in their stadium. The Yankees, who played in the season-opening game last Thursday in Washington, completed a three-game series with the defending World Series champion Nationals on Sunday.


  MLB said in a statement that the games were postponed while it "conducts additional COVID-19 testing" and that members of the Marlins team traveling party were self-quarantining in place while the league awaits the results. COVID-19 is the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.


  The coronavirus pandemic has played havoc with professional sports worldwide, delaying the start of seasons, forcing the cancellation or postponement of major events, pushing the Summer Olympics planned for Japan back by a year and leading to major questions about health risks for athletes and others.


  The National Basketball Association and National Hockey League are scheduled to resume their pandemic-interrupted seasons later this week. U.S. collegiate sports also are in flux, with some conferences scrubbing fall competition and others struggling with how best to proceed.


  According to an ESPN report, eight Miami players and two coaches tested positive after the latest round of testing on Sunday. That came after four Marlins players received positive test results during the team's trip to Philadelphia.


  Prior to their season opener, the Marlins were in Atlanta last Tuesday and Wednesday for exhibition games.


  "The health of our players and staff has been and will continue to be our primary focus as we navigate through these unchartered waters," Marlins CEO Derek Jeter said in a statement.


  "Postponing tonight's home opener was the correct decision to ensure we take a collective pause and try to properly grasp the totality of this situation," Jeter added.


  Jeter said the club has conducted another round of testing for players and staff members, and the team will remain in Philadelphia pending the results of those tests, which were expected later on Monday.


  'SLIPPERY SLOPE'


  Unlike the NBA, which has assembled its teams in a restricted campus at Disney World in Florida, most MLB teams are playing in their usual stadiums and following a schedule designed to limit travel.


  However, the government of Canada barred the Blue Jays franchise from playing its home games in Toronto, citing the health risks posed by players and staff traveling to locations in the United States with large numbers of coronavirus cases. The Blue Jays are due to play most of their "home" games in Buffalo, New York.


  "This is a super-slippery slope," Victor Matheson, a specialist in sports economics who teaches at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, told Reuters.


  "One of the problems with Major League Baseball in particular is that they play so many games, which means that anything that knocks your team out for any sort of reasonable quarantine period is a huge problem in terms of scheduling," Matheson added.


  The very first game of the season was played in Washington last Thursday just hours after one of the young stars on the Nationals' roster, outfielder Juan Soto, was held out of the Opening Day lineup after testing positive for the virus.


  According to MLB's operations manual for the coronavirus-delayed season, team members who test positive must have two negative tests taken at least 24 hours apart before they are allowed to return to team facilities.


  MLB had originally planned to open its 162-game regular season in late March but decided to postpone it because of the health threat posed by the pandemic, eventually opting for a condensed 60-game schedule that kicked off last Thursday.


  The National Hockey League is due to resume its season on Saturday with an expanded 24-team playoff format at two sites in Canada. The NBA is scheduled to resume its season on Thursday, playing at a single site at Walt Disney World.

Christine N. Matesich      Zanesville - Christine N. Matesich died July 25, 2020 at her home. Born to Arthur and Gertrude (Trudy) Meissner in Toledo, Ohio October 18, 1945, Mrs. Matesich is survived by her husband John whom she married September 9, 1969, their daughters Jennifer (David) Gran, Katherine, and her very special grandson, Benjamin Reid Gran. She is also survived by her aunt Laurie Happ and cousins in Texas, Florida, New York and Toledo, Ohio. She was preceded in death by her parents, and by her sister Linda.      Chris was an inspiring and dedicated mother and grandmother, and a special friend to her daughters, husband and grandson. While she always avoided the spotlight in her endeavors, she was an outgoing and beautiful person, whose personality radiated interest in those she met. A graduate of The University of Toledo in Education, she was a genuine and effective educator, whose love of teaching whether young children or adults, always involved more than just the subject. She truly loved the students to whom she was entrusted, and helped them to succeed and overcome whatever hurdles they imagined or incurred in their life while under her care.      She was also a community volunteer in organizations, giving her time and talent to a wide variety of interests, usually the underserved, vulnerable, or avoided. Her commitment to an organization and service was full and complete, not just interested in lending her name to a cause. She worked diligently and passionately and while exhibiting a gentle personality, was able to deal with tough and difficult board issues honestly, effectively and directly.      She possessed a keen sense of the beauty in the visual world, and her observations were typical of a deeper artistic sense. While having little business education other than her work in her early years in retail while in high school and college, her intuition about the small business she helped establish was usually 'spot on'. She fostered team work before it was a buzz word and her practical sense of right and wrong, served her successfully in her interactions with her customers.      Her daughters thought of her as a trailblazer, who worked summers on the East Coast, paid her way through college, flew for American Airlines while living in Chicago, and started a business while in her sixties. These were just a few of the markers of her creative mindset and positive attitude that helped her achieve beyond what was expected.      She will be missed by her friends and family because of her kindness, humor, and genuine care for them as persons. Loyal and steadfast, her word was her bond, and character unquestioned. She will be sadly missed by those who knew her well, and others she merely touched by her acquaintance. Her extended family was as important to her as her children, and she treasured the life long memories of them by how she lived her own life from their lessons.      According to her wishes, Chris will be cremated and her ashes spread over the land and sea she loved. A private family service and memorial Service will be held this week. To send an online condolence please visit www.hilliscombsnestor.com.      Memorial contributions may be made to the local charity of one's choice or to the Muskingum County Animal Shelter in her name.

The state- run broadcaster said that a transcript of a conversation showed Han trying to help the reporter dig up some dirt on high-level officials in the Moon Jae-in administration before the election. After the news broke, many citizens harbored suspicions about the possibility of the senior prosecutor encouraging the Channel A reporter to gather news inappropriately.\n However, according to a transcript released by Lee, the reporter, Han did not make any comments that can be interpreted as a willingness to help the reporter. Instead, Han flatly refused to offer any information, for instance, on pro-government commentator Rhyu Si-min, an outspoken liberal pundit. After KBS was criticized for broadcasting "

 On the dance floor, various distancing measures could separate partiers, including circles on the floor that isolate dancers from each other and a double rope that keeps two metres separation from the seated area to prevent overspill.
 "It's really reimagining what a dance floor is," Deane said.
 "Not saying we can't dance anymore or that there can only be lounges, but what can we do instead?"
 Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at Toronto General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, said the guidelines outlined by Deane are well thought out, though he's still concerned about how they would fare in a real-world setting.
 Many people still assume that masks are a fail-proof barrier, and Bogoch worries that could play out in the clubs.
 "Masks might provide a little bit of benefit but not as much as people think," he said.
 "They forget that physical distancing is really driving it."
 He said it's time for a "tremendous PR campaign" that encourages people to understand the roles of masks and physical distancing in indoor spaces.
 "I don't think there's any easy answer here," he said. "A lot of things are very easy to say, but just hard to do."
 Reza Afshari, a clinical professor at the University of British Columbia, expects the coming months will be unpredictable for nightlife as more people head indoors in the cooler weather. While that presents new hurdles that could lead to rollbacks in reopenings, he believes a collaborative relationship between the provincial government, scientists and club owners themselves could help endure the challenges ahead.
 "Putting regulation in place is like a faucet that you're opening more. If you see there are some side effects, then the speed of the running water should become slower," he said.
 "There is no rule that's being written on a stone."

In the beginning of April, the Javits Convention Center in New York City was transformed into a temporary field hospital for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, many of whom flooded and overloaded the city's hospital systems throughout the peak of the pandemic.


  That's when Hartsaw stepped in. The Navy mobilized her April 3 and days later she was in New York getting briefed on what was then an indefinite deployment, the Gillette News Record reports.


  Each morning for almost a month, she would wake up in her hotel room, manage the 5 a.m. walk through the barren streets of Manhattan dressed in fatigues and suit up for another battle against the novel coronavirus.


  The inside of the Javits Center field hospital took on a cold, industrial aesthetic, she said. Blocks of patient rooms were arranged throughout the inpatient section, where Hartsaw worked. An ICU, located separately, was built to house the more severe cases.


  Generators hummed loudly as military personnel shouted muffled words to one another through face masks further obstructed by plastic face shields. The overhead lights never shut off.


  Patients stayed in cubicle rooms consisting of a hospital cot, one metal folding chair and a floor lamp rendered mostly useless by the constant brightness throughout the convention center. They were logged electronically upon arrival, she said, but paper charts and records were mostly used.


  "'Blade Runner' is what it reminded me of, even though it wasn't raining," she said, referencing the classic 1982 sci-fi film set in an overcrowded future. "It was just like being in a movie. You just never knew how much weirder it could get, but you knew it probably could."


  In New York, she lived in a bubble that included the hotel she stayed in and the convention center she worked in, a makeshift military barracks and hospital respectively.


  The walk between the two each morning and afternoon solidified how odd her life had become.


  "A city of millions of people and no one's out," she said. "Even when it was kind of more normal, it was terribly abnormal. There just weren't any people."


  N95 respirators, surgical masks, protective eyewear, gloves and medical scrubs with a disposable gown worn on top became her uniform. She didn't have a proper name tag, but a strip of beige tape across her chest that read her name in black marker: "Commander Sara Hartsaw, MD." Another stretch of tape read "Team Bravo Leader."


  During her time there, Hartsaw oversaw a morning shift team of five, including herself. They worked most days from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. At one point, her team had 104 patients under its care.


  "The flood gates opened and we started taking care of people," she said.


  Hartsaw led her own team, but she also was in charge of managing the rest of the inpatient side, a tall order that gave her responsibility for the scheduling and overseeing of about 95 people divided into multiple teams.


  "I have no idea why they picked me, but they did," she said.


  At that time, New York was quickly becoming the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States.


  Detached from the rest of the city, the steady presence of ambulances dropping patients off from hospitals all throughout the five boroughs was one of the only connections to the outside world those deployed to the city had.


  She likened the Javits Center field hospital to a halfway house. Patients came there from other hospitals when they were more or less on the mend to clear room for new COVID-19 patients. They were too sick to go home but, for the most part, they had recovered enough to leave the hospital.


  Soon they were scrambling to clear patients from the Javits Center, too, as the overflow venue came close to overflowing itself.


  "We were trying to get people out as soon as we could because we had no idea how many more people were coming," she said.


  The patients who did arrive had eclectic ties to different parts of the city and the world. Romanian, Korean and Creole were just some of the languages spoken by patients there, making communication difficult for some.


  With their own phones, which were kept in plastic sandwich bags they stocked up on from Target, Hartsaw and her team called a "language line" that they could access for translation services. Their gloves and the baggies surrounding their phones added several layers atop the smartphones' touch screens. When making calls, they had to slide the phone through the bag's zip closure to hear and be heard on the calls, she said.


  Between the phone service and the large number of multilingual people on site, they found ways to bridge communication gaps and effectively treat patients.


  "You're from Kansas, how do you speak Mandarin?" Hartsaw wondered aloud about some of the people she worked with. "These people have wonderful talents."


  The newness of the situation brought about challenges and innovations to overcome them. However, the novelty of the situation did not offset its reality for Hartsaw.


  By her second day working in New York, she felt the imminence of the virus.


  "Why do we even bother putting all this stuff on?" she remembered thinking about the layers of personal protective equipment weighing her down at the time. "We are all going to have this (virus). ‚Ä¶ We should just get over it and do our jobs better by being able to be a human to this person who doesn't have to wear all this stuff."
