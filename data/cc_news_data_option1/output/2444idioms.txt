Strong progress towards meeting our 'Second Nature' sustainability targets


--DocBreak--
Legislation to permit sports betting in Georgia made a comeback Friday in the state Senate as lawmakers scramble to drum up new revenues to plug the state's coronavirus-ravaged budget.
   
 A measure by Sen. Burt Jones, R-Jackson, that would legalize sports betting and hand management responsibilities to the Georgia Lottery Corporation was tacked onto a separate bill dealing with traffic tickets.
   
 It would allow online betting platforms like FanDuel and Draft Kings to operate legally, so long as they secure licenses from the lottery. People who are 21-years and older in Georgia could place bets.
   
 Revenues from sports betting, which Jones pegged at a "conservative estimate" of $60 million annually, would go to fund Georgia's HOPE scholarships for state university students and preschool programs.
   
 Supporters say those revenues would also be a boon for the state budget, which is set for spending cuts of roughly $2.6 billion for the 2021 fiscal year.
   
 On Friday, Jones said a bump in revenues plus the existing management know-how by the lottery should make the bill palatable for those wary of freeing up more forms of gambling in Georgia.
   
 "This right here, the online betting program, is I think an answer to adding significant revenue dollars to a system [that] moving down the road will continue to need more dollars," Jones said Friday. "And you're taking an activity that is currently going on right now."
   
 Jones's sports betting package was added to House Bill 903, a short bill tweaking motor vehicle citation rules that flew out of the state House of Representatives by a near-unanimous vote in March.
   
 It passed out of the Senate Special Judiciary Committee in a vote early Friday morning and now heads to the full Senate. The committee, chaired by Sen. Jen Jordan, D-Atlanta, is composed entirely of Democratic lawmakers.
   
 Gambling legislation has had a rocky road in the General Assembly in recent years, including during the current 2020 legislative session. A measure to let voters decide whether to legalize sports betting, casinos and horse racing died in the House in March.
   
 Even Jones's bid for sports betting looked dead in the water. A measure he brought to legalize the activity, Senate Bill 403, died quietly in the Republican-controlled Senate Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee without a vote in March.
   
 Gambling aficionados have long urged the state legislature to give voters the final say in whether they want to partake in gaming forms besides just the lottery, which sends millions of dollars each year to the popular HOPE program. Detractors call the activity a moral vice that squanders people's money and family time.
   
 But the money crunch brought on by the state's economic slowdown amid the coronavirus pandemic has thrown a new variable into the gambling equation. Faced with deep spending cuts, lawmakers are seeking ways to drum up revenues for the budget.
   
 Sen. Nikema Williams, who chairs the Democratic Party of Georgia, said Friday she was concerned about a lack of provisions guaranteeing funds for preschool programs in Jones's measure but said its passage would help ease the pain for state agencies facing budget cuts.
   
 "I have consistently said that we can't cut ourselves out of this deficit that we're facing right now," said Williams, D-Atlanta. "And we have to look at additional revenue streams."
   
 Local sports organizations also turned out Friday to praise passage of the measure out of committee. Steve Koonin, the CEO of the Atlanta Hawks basketball organization, said the sports-betting measure would boost fan interest in the sport while bolstering state revenues.
   
 "During this difficult time for our professional sports teams, maintaining and building our engagement and relationship with fans is absolutely critical," Koonin said.
   
 Tobacco tax increase surfaces in General Assembly
   
 Georgia's third-lowest-in-the-nation tobacco tax would go from 37 cents a pack to $1.35 under legislation the Senate Finance Committee approved Friday.
   
 If the bill makes it through the General Assembly, it would represent the culmination of years of effort by health-care groups to build support for raising the state's tobacco tax.
   
 What is finally helping the proposal gain support is the state's financial situation. The full Senate passed a fiscal 2021 state budget earlier Friday with $2.6 billion in spending cuts forced upon lawmakers by the impact the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown of the economy has had on tax revenues.
   
 In voting against the budget, minority Democrats complained that legislative leaders were refusing to consider revenue-raising measures that could help offset some of the cuts.
   
 The Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, an Atlanta-based think tank that has consistently called for legislation increasing revenues, released a statement late Friday supporting the tobacco tax hike.
   
 "Lifting the tobacco tax will simultaneously help our state fund critical priorities, such as health and education, and boost health outcomes," said Danny Kanso, a GBPI policy analyst. "GBPI commends Chairman [Chuck Hufstetler, R-Rome] and the Senate Finance Committee for their leadership in passing legislation that will generate several hundred million dollars per year by bringing our state's abysmally low tobacco tax in line with the level assessed in most states across the nation."
   
 Raising the tobacco tax to $1.35 a pack would fall well short of the national average of $1.80 a pack, and Kanso suggested lawmakers consider that when the bill heads to the Senate floor.
   
 But the legislation faces an uphill battle in the Georgia House of Representatives.
   
 "I'm not a tax increaser, particularly during this [economic] climate we're in," House Speaker David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, said earlier this week.
   
 Ralston also is skeptical about another effort by Hufstetler's committee to free up more tax revenue. The Senate Finance panel passed a bill Thursday that would eliminate a series of tax breaks the state offers to lure businesses to Georgia.
   
 The speaker argued that getting rid of such tax incentives would put a damper on economic development efforts that create jobs.
   
 "This is not a good time to be killing jobs," he said. We need to be about the business of growing jobs back."

Russian President Vladimir Putin, 68, reaffirmed his will to keep power for life by saying he will run for the 2024 presidency if voters approve constitutional changes through a referendum on July 1. He justified his decision by saying it is to avoid confusion resulting from him becoming a lame duck. The Kremlin is handing out prizes, including apartments, cars, and smartphones to encourage voting. When asked about the possibility of running for another presidential term during an interview with the Russia-1 TV on Sunday, Putin said he is not ruling out the possibility of running for office if constitutional changes are approved by voters. “I can tell you from my own experience that in about two years, instead of the regular rhythmic work on many levels of government, you’d have eyes shifting around hunting for possible successors,” said Putin. “It’s necessary to work, not look for successors,” added Putin, suggesting that constitutional changes are needed to avoid endangering state affairs.      Putin’s term ends in 2024 since the Russian constitution limits the election of one person to the presidency to three consecutive terms. If the constitution is changed, Putin will be able to run for the 2024 presidency and seek two more six-year terms. This is practically keeping power for life as he will be able to be in power until 2036 when he becomes 84.      According to The Washington Post (WP), the Kremlin is putting public officials and employees at state-run enterprises under pressure aside from handing out prizes. Some public officials, teachers, and employees at state-run enterprises are reportedly told to submit proof of voter registration.      Some experts say that the Putin administration’s pushing ahead with a national vote is a testament to its insecurity. Russia’s GDP growth this year is expected to record negative 6% due to factors, such as fatigue resulting from Putin’s 20-year reign, concerns about the second wave of COVID-19, and low oil prices. Putin’s approval rating last month hit a historic low of 59%.

It has been confirmed on Monday that Hyundai Motor Group and LG Chemical are working to set up an electric vehicle battery joint venture in Indonesia. The two companies will build electric vehicle-only battery production lines in the country and utilize it as a hub to target the future electric car market in Southeast Asia.      The two South Korean companies are still discussing the detailed size and timing of the investment. Their original target was to sign a contract to set up a joint venture in July this year, but the discussion has been temporarily on hold since March due to business uncertainties caused by COVID-19. “The two companies have been in discussion for a while. We are currently working with the local authorities to discuss incentives, such as tax benefits for constructing a local plant,” said a member of LG Chemical.      Hyundai Motor Group is growing its plants in Indonesia as the hub of its ASEAN strategy. An option to establish a joint venture in South Korea had been reviewed until the beginning of this year. However, Indonesia was selected at the end according to Hyundai Motor Group’s request for a stable battery supply.      Hyundai Motor Group’s Vice Chairman Chung Eui-sun and LG Chemical’s Chairman Koo Kwang-mo had the first official meeting, the two companies announced on Monday. The two visited the electric vehicle battery production lines of LG Chemical’s Ochang plant and discussed comprehensive cooperation measures regarding electric vehicles on Monday morning. The management of Hyundai Motor Group shared the future battery technologies – for example, the long-lasting battery that is being developed by LG Chemical, lithium-sulfur battery, solid- state battery, etc. – and their development directions.

The newly released full text of the former National Security Advisor of the U.S. John Bolton’s memoir on the behind-the-scenes story of the denuclearization talks among the leaders of the two Koreas and the U.S. is causing a stir. The book, which includes his subjective interpretation, is not entirely factual. However, it is hard to ignore the political calculations prioritized by the three leaders and the absurd demands made by the North.      During a phone conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump the day after the inter-Korean summit at the Joint Security Area, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Kim Jong Un proposed the closure of the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site and promised complete denuclearization. The South Korean president practically gave a green light to his U.S. counterpart to attend a meeting with the North with faith in the country’s willingness to denuclearize. However, the attitude of the North later makes it difficult to exclude the possibility that President Moon either misjudged or subjectively interpreted the intention of the North Korean leader. According to Bolton's memoir, Kim Jong Un insistently made unacceptable demands during the Hanoi negotiations, such as the lifting of all United Nation’s sanctions against the country for closing the Yongbyon nuclear facilities, which were basically scrap metal at that point.      In addition, the South Korean government explanation that Kim Jong Un himself proposed discussions with the U.S., which later led to the U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore in 2018, is also coming under suspicion. Bolton wrote that South Korea’s National Security Office Director Chung Eui-yong proposed to Kim Jong Un to meet with President Trump while telling the U.S. president that the North Korean leader wanted to meet. Consequently, this led to misunderstanding on both sides – the U.S. assuming North Korea’s denuclearization possibility and the North believing the potential ease of sanctions. What South Korea had done was far from the “honest broker” needed in negotiations between countries and only revealed the fact that the theories that South Korea should be in a “driver’s seat” or play mediating roles are a delusion when the country loses trust.      The newly released memoir also bares the impromptu side of President Trump who has been focused on solidifying his political stance, rather than denuclearization. The book also showed that Kim Jong Un tried to take advantage of President Trump and have the sanctions removed while maintaining the country’s nuclear facilities through top-down negotiations. As each of the three leaders approached the issue based on their own political interests, a crisis has emerged on the Korean Peninsula, in which the North’s denuclearization is still far away while the country engages in military provocations due to the sanctions.      Despite the revelation of such stories, Bolton’s book breaks the unwritten rule of diplomacy of not disclosing the details of discussions between the heads of countries, which may negatively affect trust between South Korea and the U.S. Chung Eui-yong said on Monday that many parts of the Bolton’s memoir are distorted. Such a breach of trust should not be left alone amid high tensions surrounding the Korean Peninsula following North Korea’s explosion of the inter-Korean joint liaison office in Kaesong. What South Korea and the U.S. should focus on at the moment is rebuilding the bilateral trust and developing the North Korea response strategy. There is no path other than turning away from the delusional theories of being in a “driver’s seat” or playing mediating roles and leading the North to denuclearization using sanctions against the country based on international cooperation.

PLAINVILLE -- For nearly 80 years, there were countless comings and goings from the building at 142 South St. in the town center, from firefighters and the fire department's dalmatians to elected officials, municipal employees and residents stopping in to do business with the town.
 Now it's the building itself that has come and gone.
 After a few weeks behind a chain-link fence while asbestos was removed from its aged frame, the building known most recently as "the old town hall" has been demolished. The last of the walls came down just last week, leaving the building's life-long neighbor -- the historic Humphrey House that is home to the Plainville Historical Commission and town museum -- to preside over the entrance to Telford Park alone.
 The building's removal comes a little more than a year since town offices moved from the cramped World War II-era facility to the new town hall just down the street at 190 South St.
 Town Administrator Jennifer Thompson said the town had a study performed to determine whether it would make more sense to keep and renovate the building for parks and recreation use, or build new.
 "The study revealed it would be more cost effective and feasible to build something new rather than renovate," she said via email. "Town Meeting then approved the demolition of the old town hall."
 Given the town's current financial situation, she said, "there are no immediate plans to build a parks building," though that is the hope for some future point.
 "For now, the lot will be cleared and gravel will be placed in the lot where the town hall once was," she noted.
 Bittersweet moment
 For those who spent many years working in the building -- either as elected officials or town employees -- the demolition is bittersweet.
 "I have mixed emotions. It's another piece of Plainville history that's no longer with us," said Town Clerk Ellen Robertson, who worked in the building for 11 years before the move to the new town hall.
 But it was a building that had stopped being useful to the operations of a growing town in the 21st century, and one that, after being used constantly -- and for more than one purpose -- since 1941, had nothing further to offer.
 Robertson recounted her visit to the building back in 2008 when she went to pick up nomination papers to run for town clerk.
 "I remember the first thing that hit me was the smell," she said. "It smelled musty and moldy and I thought, 'what am I doing?' I thankfully followed through."
 While the building itself "was terrible" -- in its last years the toilets were constantly overflowing, the roof frequently leaked, the heating was wonky, the air was stale, and the space was overcrowded -- Robertson said "the great group of people that worked in that building" made up for the shortcomings until the town was finally able to invest in new facilities.
 Former long-time Selectman Robert Fennessy said the building was "quaint" and "had the feel of a small town, where everyone watched out for each other."
 But there was very little separation between those who worked in the building and those who dropped in on town business "because the quarters were so tight." The selectmen's "meeting room," for example, was also the town administrator's office space for many years, and a half door was the only thing that separated the town clerk's office from a closet-sized hallway space in front of it where residents stood to conduct business with members of the staff.
 "It definitely had a warm feeling, although the warmth did not come from the 50-year old-burner in the basement," Fennessy quipped.
 He said he will miss seeing the old building, "but I feel good that we now have a new building that will take us through the next 50 years."
 Assistant town accountant Annemarie Eisele, who worked for many years in the building, also said it's bittersweet to see the old building gone. When she saw photos of the pile of rubble showing up on social media recently, she admitted, "I kind of teared up a little bit."
 "But it was more like, 'wow, that's 19 years of my life just sitting there, going down," she said. "It was a strange feeling, but it needed to come down."
 For the future, she said, "personally I would love to see a rec building for the park department there, so they have a place to go on rainy days and they don't have to go running to buses to go over to the schools."
 Fennessy agrees.
 "I always thought that the location was ideal as a teen center, as it borders the town park, and maybe in better fiscal times the town can look at developing it for a new program," he said. "But right now, I'm sure the park commissioners will appreciate the added parking space as they bring in more and more participants in their activities."
 From fire station to town hall      At the end of the day, the town got quite a bit of use out of the old building.
 Its first purpose was as a fire headquarters, replacing the original fire station on Spring Street known to some today as "the Scout House." It was built in 1941 on the site of the former waiting station for the local trolley, next to the then Plainville Library inside the Humphrey House, according to Historical Commission Chairman Kristine Moore.
 Construction began in late spring of 1941, with the foundation laid and walls taking shape by July 13, 1941. It was nearly complete by Aug. 5, 1941, just about four months before the U.S. entered World War II.
 Then town offices would eventually occupy a small section of the fire station closest to the town park entrance. In 1973, the town built a combination police and fire building just down the street to meet the need for more adequate and updated space for the departments -- the now former public safety building that is presently up for sale by the town.
 Once the fire department exited 142 South St., the building was renovated and re-purposed solely for town offices.
 Moore noted that as the building was being taken apart recently -- an operation that had to be done carefully so as not to potentially damage the Humphrey House -- "the ghosts of the old fire station were observed throughout the building" -- from the outline of the old garage bays, to the outline of the windows the hoses would be draped from, and the mount for the old fire pole still present on the second floor. There were even the names of former firefighters etched into the walls and door frames.
 From an historical standpoint, she said, "it is very difficult to see yet another building of Plainville's past become only a memory."
 "It was sad to learn that the building could not be salvaged due to the asbestos and would meet the same end as   the old Wood School. It will certainly be strange from now on, looking at the Humphrey House and not seeing its neighbor," she said. "I have lived in Plainville my entire life, and like the Wood School and Falks Market, the (old) town hall has always been around; it was as familiar and recognizable as my own home and will be missed."
 The Historical Commission, she said, has an "abundance" of photographs of the old fire station/town hall from its construction to its demolition. Many of these are available to see on the commission's Facebook page and are also on display at the Humphrey House.
 A documentary exploring the history of Plainville's town offices and public safety is available on the commission's YouTube Channel: Plainville Historical Commission PHC.
