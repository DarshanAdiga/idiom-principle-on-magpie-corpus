Francis also called for _" open societies that integrate everyone,"_ a line that would just as easily fit in a brochure for a George Soros-backed activist group. _" Every brother or sister in need, when abandoned or ignored by the society in which I live, becomes an existential foreigner, even though born in the same country,"_ he said. _" They may be citizens with full rights, yet they are treated like foreigners in their own country."_
 Although the encyclical was woke-friendly in many respects, its title, _"Fratelli Tutti,"_ translates to _"Brothers All"_ in English - connoting male dominance to some. The Vatican said the title was taken from the words of St. Francis of Assisi, the pope's namesake, and couldn't be changed. And in any case, an encyclical is inherently addressed to the whole world, and the Italian word "Fratelli" means brothers but can be used to mean brothers and sisters.
 The Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit priest based in Washington, DC, said the title would cause the Vatican _" self-inflicted wounds"_ and lamented that the church didn't _" get ahead of the curve for once."_ Catholic women's-rights activist Tina Beattie of the UK tweeted: _" Languages develop. Surely, you're not saying the language of the past binds us forever. Changing attitudes to women require linguistic changes."_
 Annemarie Paulin-Campbell, a Jesuit school chief in South Africa, called _" Fratelli Tutti"_ an _" encyclical of love that misses the boat on women."_

HAMPTON - Author Barbara from Harlem spoke Sunday about her shift from Black Democrat to the Republican Party.
   
 With no last name offered, she is only known by her moniker. She spoke about her reasons for deciding she was no longer a Democrat, also signing copies of her book "Escaping the Racism of Low Expectations."
   
 The talk was sponsored by conservative group 603 Alliance and the New Hampshire Seacoast Republican Women at the Best Western of Hampton.
   
 SRW president Donna Slack welcomed guests. She talked about how tough the year has been for everyone with the coronavirus forcing many of their events to be canceled and said they are hoping next year will be better.
   
 Diane Bitter, organizer of Sunday's event attended by about 20 people, said 603 Alliance has known about Barbara from Harlem for many years and they love her.
   
 "She worked with the 603 Alliance at their first summit in 2015," said Bitter. "She called me and said she was going to be in New Hampshire. ... We were so excited she was in the state, so we quickly put together an impromptu event."
   
 "Barbara was a dyed-in-the-wool Jesse Jackson Democrat," said Fran Wendelboe, co-director of the 603 Alliance, in introducing her talk. "Her eyes are opened wider now than you can imagine. I hope you all enjoy her speech. I think you are going to love her."
   
 Barbara from Harlem said saying you are Republican was considered a curse word when she first started to rethink her party affiliation.
   
 "In my community, Black equals Democrat," she said. "Now at least 73% of babies there are born without a father in the home because the Democrats tell them you don't need a man, and we will take care of you. They say it takes a government to raise a child. We have mothers on food stamps, living in affordable housing.
   
 "When I came to realize I could not serve God, it caused me to reject the theme of the Democratic Party. I worked on Rudy Giuliani's campaign. I was proud. His opponent was Black, but Rudy was better. I worked for George Bush, even Mitt Romney. I did not vote for Obama."
   
 Barbara from Harlem said her uncle told her to thank God for slavery.
   
 "He said were it not for slavery, where would we be," she said. "That registered with me. Slavery made it possible for me to achieve the American dream, to buy a house, to get an education. God allowed what man meant for evil because he meant it for good. My forefathers being brought here was a blessing. I thank God for slavery, for America, for so I could be born free. This country owes me nothing and I have been Black all of my life. Black Lives Matter people are just playing into the white Dems game."
   
 Barbara from Harlem said Donald Trump is a president who cares about people.
   
 "We have a president changing a lot of things that should have been changed a long time ago," she said. "He's not trying to get rich; he already is. So, talk to your friends. Tell them politics is going to control your life, so you better get involved. We need to get these no morals, no religion heathens out of office. God did not give us a mind to speak so we could hide on the couch."
   
 "Tell the truth. What's going on is real. He is correcting the wrongs of people like Joe Biden. What he is doing in the Black community is phenomenal. Obama did nothing for us, got rich and played that white people card. Stop letting them play the race card."
   
 Slack said Republican women face the same attitudes from Democrats.
   
 "We are a big party," said Slack. "I know Republican women who do not agree with all my issues, but I know Republican policy keeps the engine running. I know you, too, are considered a victim by the Democratic Party."

“Having started 300 races in WorldSBK makes me feel a little bit old, but it was a nice Superpole race because Alex was keeping me very honest. The gap was very stable and I had to concentrate to the max. We made a small set-up change from yesterday and I felt it really helped me, especially in the final laps with tyre drop. In race two, with the weather conditions at Magny Cours, you have to expect the unexpected and we saw all weekend that when there was not a lot of surface water, we were struggling. In morning warm-up and in the Superpole session, for example - especially with traction in the exit of the corner. I was losing too much on the exit of T5. But the bike set-up was pretty good in the chicanes and all the places where you had to be aggressive with the bike. It was pretty good but just this stop-and-go corner, on the exit, I had too much TC working and too much spinning. It was a really fun race because the bike was moving a lot and I was riding on the limit, but unfortunately not to the podium place that was the target.”

  The "infinity black" uniform has been in the works for multiple years, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In addition to the obvious "MLK" across the chest, there are 22 stars on each side of the shorts. The stars are meant to honor 22 of the 29 times King was jailed in the fight for equality, while also honoring the Freedom Fighters, who took part in sit-ins in the South. They're a reference to King's quote, "Only when it is dark enough can you see the stars."


  The Hawks play on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January every year. These City Edition uniforms will be worn for "select" games during the 2020-21 season, which is yet to have a determined start date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. MLK Day in 2021 is Jan. 18.

Fogg noted that previous changes in network equipment technology — which occur roughly once every 10 years and require sharp increases in capital expenditure — have typically sparked periods of upheaval as telecom groups switch equipment suppliers, companies consolidate and erstwhile incumbents fall by the wayside.
 Choosing 5G equipment suppliers “is not a simple equation,” he said. “You have to basically make a judgment call about their future. You have to think about the reliability of the life of the contract.”
 Some operators swapping out legacy Huawei equipment might favor Ericsson and Nokia because they, unlike Samsung, are more readily able to supply equipment from 2G through to 5G, analysts suggest. This leaves the European groups “very well positioned” to win opportunities in countries ditching Huawei, Pongratz said.
 Last week it was announced that Nokia will become BT’s largest supplier after it won an expanded deal to replace Huawei as a key supplier of 5G equipment to the British company.

La fiesta ibicenca no fue la unica a la que acudieron los alumnos del colegio mayor Galileo Galilei de Valencia desde el inicio del curso universitario. Salud Publica esta investigando la asistencia de jovenes de este mismo centro a otras tres celebraciones ilegales y no descarta que incluso tuvieran lugar en la misma residencia privada. Pese a estos indicios, las autoridades no barajan por el momento imponer sanciones al colegio mayor al entender que ha cumplido con sus obligaciones y que solo tenia conocimiento de una fiesta, la cual comunico. La sospecha arranco con la propia investigacion que las autoridades sanitarias emprendieron en el colegio mayor tras la deteccion de cuatro alumnos con sintomas. Entonces ya se tenia constancia de un brote previo en la Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, por lo que Sanidad decide visitar el centro el jueves y fija el montaje del puesto de cribado masivo para el dia siguiente. Durante esas entrevistas con los residentes, segun confirmaba ayer a Levante-EMV la secretaria autonomica de Salud Publica, Isaura Navarro, los profesionales sanitarios empiezan a extraer «informacion con cuentagotas» a los estudiantes del Galileo Galilei, que por separado hablan hasta de cuatro fiestas diferentes. «Cada una con nombre propio», añade Navarro, lo que permite avanzar en las pesquisas. La responsable asegura que los propios implicados reconocieron que «en ninguna de ellas se mantuvieron las medidas de seguridad» como las mascarillas y la distancia. Acerca del lugar de la celebracion, Navarro no puede confirmar que todas se produjeran en las instalaciones del propio Galileo Galilei porque la informacion que han ido aportando los estudiantes «llega a medias» por el «miedo» de los jovenes a posibles sanciones en caso de relatar con veracidad todo lo ocurrido. En cualquier caso, admite que «parece ser» que asi fue. Las multiples celebraciones, la falta de medidas de prevencion durante las mismas y la estrecha convivencia en el dia a dia entre todos los residentes del colegio mayor, empujo a las autoridades a endurecer el protocolo y pasar a considerar a todos los estudiantes como contacto estrecho de los 16 positivos que ya se habian confirmado dentro del edificio. Es por eso que en el cribado masivo efectuado el viernes en el mismo campus de Vera de la UPV, la conselleria hace firmar a los cerca de 700 alumnos una declaracion responsable de aislamiento forzoso hasta conocer el resultado de la PCR. Hasta ahora, ese documento solo se reparte entre las personas contagiadas, las que presentan sintomas o las que son contacto estrecho. Pero en este caso Salud Publica opta por ampliar el supuesto a todos los habitantes del edificio. La secretaria autonomica lo argumenta: «El que acudieran a cuatro fiestas y sin proteccion nos obliga a endurecer el protocolo por la situacion de riesgo que podrian generar. Hay que frenar ese riesgo hasta tener los resultados».

Those close to Columbia resident Ed McComb would describe him as many things.


   


  Honest. Kind. Caring. Faithful. Fun. Loving. Loyal. True.


   


  These are just some of the words that those who gathered around the World War II army veteran to celebrate his 100th birthday use to describe him.


   


  On Saturday afternoon, McComb stood in his daughter's driveway as friends and members of the Columbia community participated in a drive-by with posters, American flags, and cards for the Columbia resident.


   


  Signs that read "100 years Army strong" and "Happy 100th Ed" were held up for the veteran, who was honorably discharged in 1946 after four years as an expert rifleman and mortar section Sergeant who served in both Europe and Japan.


   


  To McComb's surprise, the parade started with Fifth Ward Councilman Matt Pitzer hopping out of a cherry-red convertible, greeting him with a smile.


   


  "Happy Birthday, sir."


   


  Pitzer then began to recite a proclamation from Columbia Mayor Brian Treece, declaring October 3, 2020, as Edmund McComb Day. His family and friends began to clap, and a joyful smile spread across McComb's face. Behind Pitzer, five cadets from Mizzou ROTC saluted the veteran.


   


  "It's been a long time since anyone's saluted me," McComb said with a giggle.


   


  According to his daughter, Nancy McKinney, that was the part of the parade that she cherished the most.


   


  "I think just, since he -- we -- moved here, being 100, he doesn't have a lot of friends," she said. "And just, to see the community support for him, and that they'd be willing to do that for him, it means a lot."


   


  For McKinney, living with her dad is easy. Growing up, the two would partner up for family games, oftentimes beating her brother and mother in badminton or various card games.


   


  "It was just so fun to have him be my partner all through it ... I was fortunate to grow up in a loving family."


   


  Back when McComb, who hails from Huntertown, Indiana, lived in Mission, Texas, he started a food bank at his local church. When he got older, someone else took it over for him. Around the age of 90, the loving father moved in with his daughter.


   


  "He's just a very, very kind person," McKinney said.


   


  Bruce McComb looks back fondly on the Sundays that he spent in the backseat of his mom and dad's vehicle. His father would let him and his sister choose which directions they wanted to pursue on those afternoon drives. Ultimately, McComb and McKinney would conspire their decisions together. Oftentimes, the family ended up at a family friend's house, where they'd go frolic around in the barn, playing on the hay bales and ropes.


   


  For McComb, one of his favorite birthday traditions from years prior was never blowing out the candles, nor was opening gifts. Instead, for McComb, it was the opportunity to be with his family -- a gift that once again presented itself to him in the driveway of his daughter's house, despite the threat of a lonesome pandemic to keep them away. Both his son and daughter-in-law drove from Ohio to be with McComb on his special day.


   


  "When I lived in Michigan, we'd have a picnic down on Lake Michigan," McComb said of his favorite birthday memories. "And we'd have a volleyball net put up, all the family together, and we'd play volleyball and swim."


   


  At that time in his life, McComb was in his thirties. Now, at 100, he's surprised that he even gets to celebrate still -- especially with a smile on his face.


   


  "Just to be around at my age is surprising. My mother...she was 97 before she passed away. My dad passed away -- he didn't even get to 50. But he was a smoker."


   


  On Friday, a flag was flown over the U.S. Capitol in Washington DC, as part of the Capitol Flag Program, in honor of McComb. That flag arrives at his doorstep in a few weeks, and is just another way in which his family has sought to honor him.


   


  Reverend Jim Hillbrick from Community United Methodist Church gets together with McComb every Tuesday. McComb, who is a huge fan of McDonald's coffee, usually met his reverend there. But, since the pandemic's swift takeover, they have since shifted their Tuesday morning coffee sessions to include the scenery of McKinney's backyard, instead. The two sit on the back porch, and McComb shares his stories with Hillbrick.


   


  According to Hillbrick, McComb loves to read Louis L'Amour. While the veteran doesn't open up much about his days back in the army, occasionally he'll share one of the many stories that he has with Hillbrick, such as how someone once saved him from drowning.


   


  To Hillbrick, McComb is more than just a faithful Methodist who attended church regularly in the pre-pandemic days. To the reverend, he's a good friend -- one that he's known for five years.


   


  "It's a big deal to honor someone who served in the military, honor someone who has turned 100 and honor somebody who is still alive and healthy."


   


  Around 30 minutes after the parade for McComb ended, five of his neighbors showed up to wish him a happy birthday. Within the blink of an eye, McComb was out of his birthday throne, decorated with colorful balloons signaling his new age. The 100-year-old was already in the middle of the street, cane in hand, greeting his neighbors as they poured out respectful words for him.


   


  McComb met every word that they said with smiles or nods, talking to them as if he'd always been a friend of theirs.


   


  "He's just a good guy," Hillbrick told the Tribune, long before the parade started.


   


  Judging by the colorful cards and posters left behind for McComb in his driveway-- and by the loving responses that he crafted for everyone around him -- nothing rings more true.

"I feel like the way we've been playing, it's time for us to step up," said cornerback Shaquill Griffin, who had one of two Seahawks interceptions on the day. "Everybody understands that in Seattle, it's been a defensive team. It's always been that way. And that's something that we gotta continue to take pride in and understand that we still gotta be those guys."
 If you were looking for an indication that Sunday might be different defensively for these Seahawks, it happened four plays into the game. Linebacker Cody Barton -- filling in for the injured Brooks -- got a piece of Ryan Fitzpatrick's pass before Seahawk safety Ryan Neal reeled in the interception. Seattle scored a touchdown six plays later and never relinquished the lead.
 But staying up on Miami wasn't necessarily a byproduct of Wilson's brilliance (although he had his moments) so much as it was the defense's perseverance. In the first quarter, the Dolphins (1-3) had it on first and 10 from Seattle's 20. The Seahawks held them to a field goal and stayed ahead, 7-3. In the second quarter, Miami had a first-and-10 from Seattle's 18, then a third-and-3 from the 11 before linebacker K.J. Wright broke up a pass to force another field goal and keep his team up 10-6.
 Later that quarter, the Dolphins had a third-and-4 from Seattle's 27 before the Seahawks caused another incompletion and forced a field goal to stay up 10-9. In the third quarter, another forced field goal to stay up 17-12. Then in the fourth, defensive lineman Alton Robinson tackled running back Myles Gaskin on third-and-3 from the 9, which forced a fifth straight field goal and kept the Seahawks up by two.
 It's not as though the Dolphins couldn't move the ball. They finished with 415 yards -- just 26 fewer than the Seahawks. But Seattle was basically the neighbor who would wave you toward the front door before slamming it in your face.
 "Everything was outstanding in my eyes," Wright said. "I thought we tackled decently, and we didn't give up those long balls that we've seen in those first few weeks, and I was tremendously happy about that."

MANSFIELD - The cast of "Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike" had been rehearsing since January for an April production, taking their practices online when COVID-19 shut down theaters in March.
 But soon they realized their show would never debut on the Mass Music & Arts Society stage that spring. Undeterred, they recorded their performances individually from their homes on Zoom, spent weeks editing it together and created a show that will open Friday, Oct. 16, online.
 The cast looked forward to their Zoom rehearsals after everything shut down in March, said Michelle Monti, a Mansfield resident who plays Sonia.
 "None of us wanted to come in person," Monti said. "We had some older people, and the director was pregnant."
 Director Katia Greene of Bridgewater had a baby girl, Elsie, this summer.
 "The rehearsals were something to look forward to every week," Monti said. "It gave us stability."
 However, they soon realized MMAS's theater in downtown Mansfield was unlikely to open for the stage production that spring and decided to record the show to preserve their hard work. Monti, who has professional video experience, offered to edit it. She received help from another actor, Ed Krasnow of Plymouth, a video professor at Massasoit Community College.
 Ken Carberry of Milton, who plays Vanya, used his background in audio to help with sound.
 All six cast members recorded their parts in their homes. Each needed to have a white background - a sheet, a wall - and make sure they had enough light. Monti described doing her part in front of her bathroom door with three lamps and her laptop balanced on a dictionary.
 Dealing with props was also a challenge. For example if one character needed to hand a mug to another the actors didn't necessarily have the exact same mugs in their homes. So sometimes the mug would change color as it changed hands.
 "We decided to own it and be funny with it," Monti said.
 The filming was done in three days, however it took more than 150 hours over the summer to edit it into a play that could be streamed.
 "It took hours and hours to make a video out of it," Monti said.
 Even editing was done through Zoom. Monti and Krasnow did it in the evenings after work.
 "He'd show me a screen and I'd talk him through it," Monti said.
 They also had to add sound effects, like doors closing.
 "We wanted to make something as entertaining and as professional as possible," Monti said.
 "Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike," a comedy by Christopher Durang, humorously adopts themes from Russian playwright Anton Chekhov.
 The cast also includes Sheila Kelleher of Plymouth as Masha, Michael Eckenreiter of Fairhaven as Spike, Beth Goldman of Norwood as Cassandra and Alyssa Germaine of South Attleboro as Nina.
 In the play Vanya and Sonia's quiet lives are disturbed by the surprise arrival of their movie star sister, Masha, accompanied by Spike. Vanya, Sonia and Masha are named after Chekhov characters by their parents.
 "If you are a Chekhov fan there are lots of funny nods to his plays, but it's written so anyone can enjoy it," Monti said. "It will make you laugh and it will make you think."
 She also said the play is very relevant now because, like Chekhov's characters, the people in the play are examining their lives.
 "The pandemic has made a lot of us rethink our lives," she said. "What will I do to get through this? What do I want to do to contribute?"
 MMAS Executive Director Ken Butler said the cast of "Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike" like many artists was determined to preserve the show in some way.
 "It was that need to keep doing art (during the pandemic)," he said. "We were all looking for something to do. We also saw it in the kids and parents at our MMAS Academy."
 MMAS also offered a summer series of drive-in outdoor concerts and comedy nights at its space at 888 South Main St. He said not only did the shows generate needed revenue for the nonprofit arts organization but they provided a venue where comedians and musicians could perform.
 Monti said she is proud that they have pivoted the business model to allow the show to go on.
 "I think we found such creative solutions," she said "I'm so proud of our work."
 "Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike" will be streamed Oct. 16, 17 and 18 on MMAS's new streaming platform, ShowTix4U. Tickets, which are $20, for this recorded event will be available soon. Check www.mmas.org for more information.
 The play is one of six production being offered by MMAS between now and December. More shows are in the works for 2021 but details are still being worked out.
 "An Evening of Duets" featuring Jennifer Mischley and Butler will be live streamed from MMAS's location at 888 S. Main St. for free Saturday, Oct. 10 at 8 p.m. and Sunday, Oct. 11 at 2 p.m. Because the performance involves singing, there will be no audience, Butler said. The event will kick off the 2020/21 season and introduce patrons to the new streaming service. It also begins the nonprofit's fundraising campaign.
 "Breaking the Shakespeare Code," a two-person play, will be both live streamed and performed before a limited audience Nov. 6 and 8 at 888 S Main St.
 "Becoming Dr. Ruth," a one-person show, will be both live streamed and performed before a limited audience Nov. 20, 21 and 22 at 888 S Main St.
 "A Broadway Christmas," featuring videos of the past eight years of this holiday show, will be live streamed Dec. 11 without any audience.
 "We will share our favorite moments," Butler said.
 "A Ghost Story of Christmas," a one-man show based on "A Christmas Carol," will both live streamed and performed before a limited audience Dec. 18, 19, and 20 at 888 S Main St.
 "Duets," "Broadway Christmas" and "Ghost Story" will be available later on demand, Butler said.

However, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said: "By the government's own admission at least four million people could lose their jobs during the crisis. All it can muster in response are piecemeal schemes and meaningless slogans.
 "This new scheme offers very little new support and relies on already overstretched work coaches on the ground, while many of the new work coaches promised have yet to materialise.
 "It's too little too late again from a government that simply can't get a grip on this jobs crisis."
 ## 'Difficult trade-offs'
 Mr Sunak is due to address the Conservative Party Conference later, saying the government has been faced with "difficult trade-offs and decisions" during the coronavirus pandemic.
 He will say that while he cannot protect every job, he will say "the pain of knowing it, only grows with each passing day".
 Mr Sunak will say his "single priority" as chancellor is "to create support and extend opportunity to as many people as I can".
 "We will not let talent wither, or waste, we will help all who want it, find new opportunity and develop new skills," he is expected to say.
 Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said her party had urged Mr Sunak to introduce a wage support scheme that incentivised employers to keep more staff on, but "he ignored these calls and now nearly a million jobs are at risk when the furlough scheme ends in a few weeks' time".
 "When he speaks at Conservative Party Conference, Rishi Sunak must promise to get a grip of the jobs crisis before it's too late," she said.
 "If he doesn't, Britain risks an unemployment crisis greater than we have seen in decades - and Rishi Sunak's name will be all over it."

“They had a great plan,” Kingsbury said. “Teddy played great and went to the right place with the ball, and they protected well. We had a hard time getting pressure, and their receivers are really talented. I’ve got to give them credit. We have to get off the field on those third-and-long situations.”
 That was never more evident than after the Cardinals got to 28-14 late in the third quarter on a Murray touchdown pass. With a chance to seize the momentum, they saw Carolina put together a 15-play, 73-yard drive that took more than 8 1/2 minutes and resulted in a field goal, making it a three-possession game.
 “I’m a firm believer that if you play your leverage and you execute and you just do your job, simple as that, the defense will be successful,” said Arizona linebacker Jordan Hicks. “It should work or at least compete.

The defensive knockout punch came later in the fourth, when the Seahawks held a 24-15 lead. On a first-and-10 from Miami's 36, Griffin intercepted Fitzpatrick at midfield, then threw the ball into the stands after going down. It led to another Seahawks touchdown, and though the Dolphins marched down the field for a score and two-point conversion to cut the lead to eight, they'd never get the ball again.
 Don't get it twisted: The Seahawks are more than a mere work-in-progress on "D." They are one of the most vulnerable teams in the NFL on that side of the ball, and must make massive strides there if they are going to win the division and make a playoff run.
 But Sunday, it was the guys protecting the end zone that won the game for Seattle. That's how it used to be for this team, and for one day, at least, it's how it was again.

 Even with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, all followed by successful 2-point conversions, the Cowboys couldn’t pull off another big comeback victory, like two weeks ago in winning McCarthy’s home debut when Prescott and Elliott also had lost fumbles against Atlanta.

 # The pride that keeps us divided
 Carl Johnson
 Your turn
 As we approach our national election day, and the rhetoric intensifies, I’m significantly troubled by the many “voices” of disrespect … disingenuousness … and disunity. I understand the climate of our nation that has contributed to this malaise. The perfect storm of suspicion, conspiracy theories, anger, racism, intrigue, separation and frustration, just to name a few.
 I can never remember a time in my life when there has been so much disagreement, name calling and bitterness. Everyone seems to have a chip on their shoulder, and we’ve become entrenched in our solemnly held “views.”
 When someone is invested in their ideology and belief system (i.e. people who adamantly claim that their view is the correct one), it is virtually impossible to affect a change in their view. For them to change would require an admission that they were wrong, which would be humiliating and a blow to their ego.
 This is true for every person, regardless of their background, education, career identity, faith (or non-faith) predisposition, or social status. Pride is what keeps us bogged down in our pursuit of truth. We would prefer to hold onto our prejudices and bigotry at the risk of acknowledging that we could be wrong.
 Granted, there does exist such a thing as objective and unambiguous truth. However, in order to find such truth, one has to acknowledge that there are absolutes. The challenge is compounded when we try to apply truth to changing cultural, political, and social realities. With so many voice” and perspectives bidding for attention today, it’s no wonder that people are so divided, and give up trying to pursue truth. It’s just easier to resign oneself to the status quo, than to expend the energy to find answers.
 Sadly, when people play word games and purposely misquote or twist meanings of what others have said, or frame their view of a person based on past actions, words, or what others have said about them, is it any wonder that we have such confusion. And we are all guilty. None of us are exempt from such misconduct. I believe that it’s a mistake to judge another human by one’s own dogma.
 As a very famous teacher from the past once observed: “He who is without sin is the only one qualified to cast the first stone” … of condemnation, rebuke and judgment.
 So what are we to do? A quote from writer Janie Cheaney in her World Magazine “Voices” column is apropos for the way forward. "Let us each accept the other side as individual humans with legitimate concerns and try to reach a compromise. To ignore actions and words in order to purge the psyche of an entire population … is impossible and ultimately destructive.”
 We may be sitting on a powder-keg of explosive frustration and anger. Now, more than ever, we need prayer, and a calm resolve to work toward peace and healing.

The Dallas Cowboys defense is giving up points at a rate unseen since the franchise’s winless inaugural season six decades ago, and their offense keeps giving up the ball even while scoring in bunches.
 “There was a lot of good football that will go totally unrecognized. That’s what happens when you lose,” coach Mike McCarthy said. “What I don’t like, is I don’t like the pattern of the four games that we’ve played. The points are outrageous, the time of possession is totally lopsided, and we’re minus-7 in the turnover ratio. That’s not a winning formula.”
 Quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott lost fumbles on consecutive offensive snaps in the second quarter, turning a tie game into a two-touchdown deficit before halftime on the way to a 49-38 loss Sunday to the Cleveland Browns.
 While Prescott became the first NFL quarterback to throw for at least 450 yards in three consecutive games, the Cowboys (1-3) allowed a franchise-record 307 yards rushing and are the first team since the Raiders in 2012 to allow 38 or more points three games in a row in the same season. The only time the Cowboys had ever done that was during their 0-11-1 debut in 1960.

Two of the NFL's top running backs this season are facing uncertain futures after being forced to leave games early with injuries on Sunday. Cleveland halfback Nick Chubb, who is fourth in the league in rushing entering the week, sustained a knee injury. Los Angeles Chargers back Austin Ekeler, who was eighth, was carted off with what seemed like a serious hamstring injury. Chubb was injured in the first quarter when his right leg was rolled up on by a pair of opposing linemen engaged with each other. He limped to the locker room. Coach Kevin Stefanski said Chubb will have an MRI. He did not know the extent of the injury. The Browns ran for 307 yards and three touchdowns despite losing Chubb. Ekeler left a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers late in the first quarter after hurting his hamstring breaking a tackle in the flat. He had trouble getting into the cart on the sideline. \"The way he limped off the field it was pretty bad,” said Chargers coach Anthony Lynn, who called Ekeler a special player. Tampa Bay’s win over the Chargers did not come without injury. Tight end O.J. Howard was lost to an Achilles tendon injury, while running backs LeSean McCoy (ankle) and Kenjon Barner (concussion) did not finish.

NEW BEDFORD - It has been six months since the coronavirus pandemic first swept across the nation, a time in which local hospital staffers learned more in the field than what their schooling had taught them.
 "We learned a lot in terms of responding to a pandemic," said Shawn Badgley, public information officer for Southcoast Health, which operates St. Luke's Hospital in New Bedford, Tobey Hospital in Wareham and Charlton Hospital in Fall River.
 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) swept across the globe, affecting employment, education and healthcare. It put a strain on all healthcare workers, especially emergency medical services (EMS) workers as well as emergency department and urgent care, Badgley said.
 Elective procedures were deeply affected by the virus, with hospitals encouraging patients to remain at home until it was safe to proceed with appointments for non-vital surgeries. Exceptions included urgent procedures, such as life-threatening conditions like gastrointestinal bleeding and imperative treatment for cancer patients.
 Dr. Dani Hackner, physician-in-chief for Southcoast Health, said that the selectiveness for these procedures took a large monetary toll on all hospitals, as it is a large source of revenue. With the state now in the first part of the Phase Three of reopening, health care providers can again provide these elective, non-urgent procedures in a safe way.
 "There has been a steady return of patients," Hackner said. "It has been a very busy past couple of months in August and September."
 With hospitals bustling once again with patients eager to resume treatment, there are restrictions.
 Southcoast Health has a new visitation policy, limiting the number of visitors to one adult for a one-hour maximum time limit between the visiting hours of 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. and 5 to 8 p.m. No visitors under the age of 12 are allowed, and ages 12-17 are allowed only with an adult.
 Exceptions include compassionate visits, parents of minor children and birth partners. Health screenings are required at all entrances, and the number of entrances are limited to control capacity.
 Temperatures are taken through camera infrared technology for a contact-free health assessment. Hackner said the hospitals are following state guidelines to make sure all patients are returning to the hospital safely.
 Patients receiving emergency medical attention are tested upon entering and receive immediate test results before proceeding into the rest of the hospital. Patients receiving elective surgeries must take a COVID-19 test at the hospital prior to their appointment and receive a negative result.
 Hackner urged all patients to not delay medical attention for strokes or heart conditions. All Southcoast Hospitals now have a designated waiting area for those exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. For patients who do not feel comfortable to enter medical facilities at this time, Telehealth is an option for patients to receive virtual treatment.
 Badgley said Southcoast continues to communicate with the community, state and municipalities for guidance. He said that hospitals plan to continue their successful response into the fall season and will be ready to help the community.
 In preparation for the upcoming influenza season, both Badgley and Hackner encouraged everyone to be vaccinated.
 Badgley said that vaccinations are mandated for all healthcare staff. He said that there will be flu clinics throughout the community for easy access to all. St. Anne's Hospital in Fall River will also make sure flu vaccines are being distributed, according to Nicholas Puleo, senior director of Marketing and Communications for Steward Health Care. They predict there will be outbreaks and spikes in cases following holidays but that abiding to guidelines that reinforce mask-wearing and social distancing will help mitigate risk.
 "We need to strengthen our steps," Hackner said. "We need to adapt and be flexible."
 During the peak of the outbreak, the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth was home to a temporary hospital. Hackner said the location was not used but can be ready to go in fairly short order if another wave hits during flu season. He said that all hospitals are adequately equipped with supplies and hopes both the region and country will be better prepared.
 "We've learned to implement infection and prevention protocols," Hackner said. "We have learned to bring forth experimental approaches and evidential approaches and implement them into practice."
 Staying in contact with providers to stay up to date and communicate have been important, he said, as well as inter-professional collaborations with other organizations.
 "We are doing our very best to continue to serve our community throughout the South Coast region," Badgley said. "We will continue with protocols and procedures in place to protect our patients, visitors and staff. There is an emphasis on safety and providing needed services as well as adapting to new realities. Everyone has worked at an incredibly high level and continue to do so."

In the home opener, the Cowboys trailed Atlanta by 20 points in the first quarter, when Prescott and Elliott had two of their three lost fumbles, and were still down 15 in the fourth. The game-ending field goal in a 40-39 win was set up after the Falcons, a team known for blowing leads, curiously watched an onside kick attempt without jumping on the ball.
 Cleveland recovered the onside kick the Cowboys tried after Prescott’s second TD pass to rookie CeeDee Lamb to get within 41-38 with 3:42 left. On the next play, Odell Beckham Jr. took a reverse handoff for a 50-yard touchdown.
 “We need to play better complementary football. Right now, it’s not happening,” McCarthy said. “We’re a come-from-behind team, and that’s not the way you win consistently.”
 The game was tied at 14 in the second quarter when Prescott was sacked by Myles Garrett and fumbled, setting up Baker Mayfield’s touchdown pass that put Cleveland ahead to stay. Elliott fumbled on the first play of the next drive, leading to another Browns touchdown.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - Do you remember when we had five named storms at once in the Atlantic? It was only the second time on record that there had been that many storms in the Atlantic at once. One of those storms was Paulette and Paulette would be known as the first zombie storm.Hurricane Paulette made landfall in Bermuda as a Category 1 and strengthened to a Category 2 over the island on September 14. Not longer after it struck Bermuda, the storm reached category two status. Shortly after that, the environment surrounding the storm changed and the storm lost speed and lost its tropical storm status. It was was downgraded to a post-tropical low- pressure system which is usually the end to most storms but it’s 2020.The remnants of Paulette some how held together and intensified back to tropical storm status approximately 300 miles off the coast of the Azores Islands, Portugal. This is rare, that this happened but not the first time a storm has spun back to life. It is is the first time, it was named a zombie storm by the National Weather Service. The last time we had a "zombie storm was in 2004 with Hurricane Ivan. I van came ashore near Gulf Shores, Alabama, and caused a lot of damage and deaths for some of the Gulf states. After that, Ivan moved back into the Atlantic and was downgraded to a tropical depression, Ivan regained strength and reached tropical storm strength before moving across Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico. It made a second landfall but this time it was over the extreme southwestern tip of Louisiana as a tropical depression.The reason Paulette was able to strengthen a second time was the above average sea surface temperatures. Tropical systems are able to gain energy through warm waters. Normally, sea surface temperatures of more than 80F allows for tropical development. Once water temperatures fall below 77F, it is tougher for systems to maintain strength. The warmer sea surface temperatures near Portugal, Paulette was able to regain tropical storm strength.Copyright 2020 WMC. All rights reserved.

Trump late Sunday afternoon staged a motorcade drive-by outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and could be seen through the window of his massive black SUV, masked and waving to supporters who gathered outside.


  Earlier, at a briefing in front of the hospital, doctors treating Trump continued to be upbeat about his condition. One of his physicians said the president could be discharged as soon as Monday, but another conceded they had not been fully forthcoming in their initial medical briefing Saturday.


  Trump’s hospitalization, the most serious known medical episode involving the country’s chief executive since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981, has roiled the presidential race a month before the Nov. 3 election. It also represents a setback to the Trump campaign strategy of turning attention away from the pandemic that has killed nearly 210,000 Americans.


  At Sunday’s briefing, the White House physician, Dr. Sean Conley, provided several significant new pieces of information about the 74-year-old president, saying that he had experienced a “high fever” Friday morning and had received supplemental oxygen for about an hour before being transported to the military hospital in suburban Bethesda, Md., later that day.


  He disclosed that Trump’s oxygen level had fallen again on Saturday to the point that supplemental oxygen was again required, and that scans of his lungs showed some indications of damage, although he insisted they were not of “major clinical concern.”


  Significantly, Conley said the president had been given dexamethasone, a steroid. Doctors prescribe that drug for COVID-19 patients to combat lung damage caused by inflammation, which is one of the major ways the disease can kill patients. Experts had said previously that a decision to put Trump on the drug would be a major development.


  Conley had not answered a question Saturday about whether Trump had been given any steroid and had also evaded repeated questions about supplemental oxygen. On Sunday, he acknowledged that he had omitted some information at the earlier briefing, saying he was “trying to reflect the upbeat attitude” of Trump and his aides.


  “It came off that we were trying to hide something,” he said, adding that had not been their intent. He continued to withhold some information, however, declining to say how low Trump’s oxygen level had dropped, for example. On Friday it fell “below 94%” but hadn’t hit “the low 80s,” he said.


  The disclosure that Trump is receiving dexamethasone is a clear signal that his illness is a serious one, said Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. In an interview Saturday, Jha said he would watch for use of dexamethasone, which would be a “very clear signal that he has a more severe disease.”


  In mild cases, he said, “we actually think it does more harm than good.”


  On Sunday, Jha repeated that assessment, noting that it was unclear whether Trump could suffer long-term damage to his lungs. Some patients have breathing trouble even after their initial recovery, he noted.


  Although doctors have only released incomplete information, Jha said it appears Trump has a moderate case of COVID-19.


  “I don’t think he’s out of the woods yet. He could get worse,” Jha said. “And I think he needs very close monitoring.”


  Like other steroids, dexamethasone can have significant side effects that could have an impact on Trump’s ability to work. Those can include irritability, mood swings and trouble sleeping, according to medical experts. By reducing fever and discomfort, it can also make patients feel temporarily better even if their illness and risk haven’t changed, Dr. Robert M. Wachter, head of the Department of Medicine at UC San Francisco, said on Twitter.


  The National Institutes of Health recommends use of the drug for COVID-19 patients who need supplemental oxygen, but cautions against it in mild cases.


  Despite the disclosure of more serious symptoms, the medical team said Trump was doing well on Sunday.


  “Since we last spoke, the president has continued to improve,” Conley said, adding that the course of any illness has “ups and downs.”


  Another of the medical team, Dr. Brian Garibaldi of Johns Hopkins University, said Trump was “up and around” and feeling well.


  “Our hope is that we could plan for a discharge as early as tomorrow,” he said.


  At the same time, however, the doctors said that Trump was only midway through a five-day course of remdesivir, an antiviral drug that medical experts have said would be more difficult to provide outside a hospital setting.


  Jha said Sunday he was puzzled by the comment that Trump could be discharged quickly.


  “This whole thing strikes me as very unusual. You would not have a normal person getting discharged at this moment,” he said. “Obviously they can do a lot for him out of the White House. But I find this strange, and not consistent with how this is typically managed.”


  Earlier Sunday, Trump’s national security advisor, Robert O’Brien, appearing on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” portrayed Trump as “firmly in control” of the government. He refused to discuss details of contingency plans if the president were incapacitated, but said “we’re prepared” for any scenario.


  O’Brien, who recovered from a bout of COVID-19 over the summer — said he would expect the president to remain hospitalized “for at least another period of time,” adding that “day seven and eight are the critical days.”


  The contradictory accounts by doctors and White House officials indicate how Trump, who often tries to mold facts to fit his preferred narrative, has extended that approach to his own medical care.


  Asked why he wasn’t upfront Saturday about Trump receiving oxygen, Conley admitted that the omission was part of a public relations front.


  “I was trying to reflect the upbeat attitude that the team, the president, that his course of illness had had,” Conley said. “I didn’t want to give any information that might steer the course of illness in another direction.”


  The White House acknowledged that the awareness that Trump may be listening can affect how medical information is presented. Spokeswoman Alyssa Farah, asked by reporters about Conley’s concession that he had not been fully candid, said that “when you’re treating a patient, you want to project confidence, you want to lift their spirits. And that was the intent.”


  Farah also said that the White House would disclose the number of positive tests that personnel there have had. Until now, reporters have learned of some cases, but the White House has not provided a full accounting.


  In addition to influencing what his doctors say, Trump has also attempted to inject some of his own medical advice into his care. On Saturday, Conley said the president had asked about whether he should take hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that has been touted among his allies and in conservative media despite no proof that it’s effective against the coronavirus.


  “We discussed it. He asked about it,” Conley said. “He’s not on it now.”


  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), appearing on CBS, emphasized that “our prayers are with the president and the first lady,” who has also tested positive for coronavirus, but suggested that senior Democrats were being left in the dark about the president’s condition.


  “We’re getting our information the way everyone else is, in the media,” she said.


  Without directly addressing the contradictory statements about Trump’s condition, Pelosi alluded to the president’s tendency to berate or undercut aides when their words, even if factual, displease him. The public, she said, should not be left with the impression that when Trump’s doctors give a briefing, “it has to be approved by the president. That’s not very scientific.”


  The White House has also undertaken a less-than-robust effort to trace other people who might have been in contact with Trump and exposed to the virus. A number of people who were around the president over the previous week have said publicly that no one from the White House had reached out and urged they be tested.


  The Trump campaign, however, sought to portray the president as having consistently been serious about public health protocols to fight the coronavirus — even though he has repeatedly denigrated mask-wearing, as recently as his Tuesday debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden.


  Campaign senior advisor Jason Miller, appearing on multiple news-talk shows, was peppered with questions about lax enforcement of government disease- prevention guidelines at the White House and at campaign events attended by Trump.


  On ABC’s “This Week,” Miller accused Biden of using masks as a “prop.”


  On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” he was asked why Trump did not self-isolate Wednesday after his close aide Hope Hicks tested positive for the virus, as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines call for in cases of known exposure.


  “They take a lot of precautionary measures,” Miller said of Trump’s team.

The Cowboys then had turnovers on consecutive plays last week at Seattle — on their last snap of the first half, and then first snap after halftime in a 38-31 loss.
 “We keep hurting ourselves on offense, putting our defense in bad spot. And not starting fast enough, that’s what’s been killing us over the past few games,” Prescott said. "That’s definitely frustrating, is just making the same mistakes over and over.”
 In the home opener, the Cowboys trailed Atlanta by 20 points in the first quarter, when Prescott and Elliott had two of their three lost fumbles, and were still down 15 in the fourth. The game-ending field goal in a 40-39 win was set up after the Falcons, a team known for blowing leads, curiously watched an onside kick attempt without jumping on the ball.
 Cleveland recovered the onside kick the Cowboys tried after Prescott's second TD pass to rookie CeeDee Lamb to get within 41-38 with 3:42 left. On the next play, Odell Beckham Jr. took a reverse handoff for a 50-yard touchdown.
 “We need to play better complementary football. Right now, it’s not happening,” McCarthy said. “We’re a come-from-behind team, and that’s not the way you win consistently.”
 The game was tied at 14 in the second quarter when Prescott was sacked by Myles Garrett and fumbled, setting up Baker Mayfield's touchdown pass that put Cleveland ahead to stay. Elliott fumbled on the first play of the next drive, leading to another Browns touchdown.

“Shoutout to the boys up front,” Herbert said after the game. “All game long we just kept pushing, kept chopping at it.”


  Herbert, a transfer from Kansas, generated big play after big play throughout the game. He had kick returns of 83 and 42 yards on the day. He also had runs for 42, 23 and 60 yards, boosting the Hokie offense. All in all, Herbert generated 208 yards on the ground and 150 yards in the return game, leading the way for Virginia Tech. He is on pace for a great season thus far, with 312 rushing yards and three touchdowns through his first two games in a Hokie uniform.

PORTLAND -- A couple rows of white footballs are part of the wall of the press box at the stadium at Portland High School.
   
 Each of those commemorates the league championships won by the Portland football program.
   
 There's been plenty of those in recent years for the Raiders.
   
 And each year, a new group relishes the challenge of trying to add another white football to that wall.
   
 Portland took a big step toward adding a football for 2020 to that wall Friday with its 21-7 victory over rival Lansing Catholic.
   
 Reis Phillips had a pair of rushing touchdowns to help the Raiders (2-1, 2-0) put themselves in the driver's seat to win the CAAC White for a sixth straight season. Friday's victory was the 28th consecutive in league play for Portland, which hasn't lost a White contest since falling Williamston in Week 6 of the 2014 season.
   
 "It's very impressive. It's kind of a legacy we have to win (the league title) for five years in a row," Phillips said. "We want to keep it going and just keep it a tradition because it's something that Portland strives to do and to keep a great program."
   
 Beating Lansing Catholic has gone a long way toward each of those last five league titles. The Raiders have won the last six regular-season meetings between the teams and eight of the last 10 matchups between the programs since 2015.
   
 But there still is work to do for Portland with league games against Eaton Rapids and Ionia the next two weeks. But the Raiders find themselves in a good spot and are the only team in the White that is unbeaten in conference play.
   
 "The kids look forward to trying to put one of those (footballs) up there and I think they don't want to let the team down from the year before," Portland coach John Novara said. "We put league championship as our first goal. We have two tough games left, so we're not there yet. It was a big win for us to give us a little bit of an advantage."
   
 RAIDERS SHOW GROWTH
   
 Friday's victory was a sign of the growth for a young Portland squad, who had a tough start to the season with a 37-3 road loss at DeWitt two weeks ago. The Raiders showed their toughness and physicality with Haden Getchell, Caden Galey, Trent Trierweiler and Phillips all playing a part in a strong rushing attack. Their efforts and Portland's offensive line helped it control the ball and limit opportunities for Lansing Catholic's offense.
   
 And a defense that struggled against DeWitt's high-powerred passing attack in Week 1 showed the progress it has made. The unit made things tough for Lansing Catholic junior quarterback Joey Baker, who completed just 6 of 15 passes and threw an interception. The Cougars were limited to just 170 yards of offense.
   
 "We wanted to control the ball by running it," Novara said. "We've got a young team and we're growing up. I thought they played really physical and controlled the football and played great defense.
   
 "I just thought we were 10 times more physical than we have been the last two games. I think playing DeWitt Week 1 is a good thing for you. You have to grow up, you have to play more physical, you have to play fast. We took a tough loss to them, but I think our kids are getting better each week."
   
 MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR COUGARS
   
 Lansing Catholic (2-1, 2-1) was dominant in the opening two wins of the season with routs of Eaton Rapids and Ionia. But the Cougars struggled and made too many mistakes in their first big test of the season.
   
 The high-octane Lansing Catholic offense that scored 85 points in the first two weeks didn't find the end zone Friday. The Cougars got their lone touchdown on an 82-yard punt return by junior standout Alex Watters in the late stages of the third quarter.
   
 Lansing Catholic had a chance to make it a one-score game in the middle stages of the fourth when it reached the red zone. But a penalty and a bad snap led to the Cougars coming away empty.
   
 And it was those kind of mistakes that contributed to Friday being a missed opportunity for Lansing Catholic in its quest to capture its first White championship since 2014.
   
 There are things to clean up for the Cougars, who will need help in order to claim a share of a league championship. Lansing Catholic also has two other big tests looming in the last half of the regular season with games against Mason and Pewamo-Westphalia - programs that both won league titles last fall and are off to 3-0 starts.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — The Dallas Cowboys defense is giving up points at a rate unseen since the franchise's winless inaugural season six decades ago, and their offense keeps giving up the ball even while scoring in bunches.
 “There was a lot of good football that will go totally unrecognized. That’s what happens when you lose,” coach Mike McCarthy said. “What I don’t like, is I don’t like the pattern of the four games that we’ve played. The points are outrageous, the time of possession is totally lopsided, and we’re minus-7 in the turnover ratio. That’s not a winning formula.”
 Quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott lost fumbles on consecutive offensive snaps in the second quarter, turning a tie game into a two-touchdown deficit before halftime on the way to a 49-38 loss Sunday to the Cleveland Browns.
 While Prescott became the first NFL quarterback to throw for at least 450 yards in three consecutive games, the Cowboys (1-3) allowed a franchise-record 307 yards rushing and are the first team since the Raiders in 2012 to allow 38 or more points three games in a row in the same season. The only time the Cowboys had ever done that was during their 0-11-1 debut in 1960.
 “We’ve just got to do a better job of preparing and really coming with our full hearts in the game and play this game for 60 minutes straight,” defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence said. “It's just all about going down and really showing that you’re a real man out there and playing together."
 Even with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, all followed by successful 2-point conversions, the Cowboys couldn’t pull off another big comeback victory, like two weeks ago in winning McCarthy’s home debut when Prescott and Elliott also had lost fumbles against Atlanta.
