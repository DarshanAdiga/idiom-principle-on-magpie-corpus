"Hertha BSC would like to state that this was the failure of a single player. The fact that other team members did not draw his attention to this misconduct and instead returned his greeting by handshake shows that the regular references to distance and hygiene rules must be made even more strongly," Hertha said in a statement.

The footage, which has since been deleted, was broadcast on the same day the German soccer league (DFL) reported 10 positive cases of Covid-19 among the country's 36 clubs in the top two divisions, and it appeared to contradict the league's assertion that everything was being done to prevent the spread of the virus.

"Kalou did not only cause great damage to Hertha BSC with his video, but has given the impression that individual players are not taking the coronavirus issue seriously, especially in the current discussion about a resumption of play and professional soccer's role," Hertha general manager Michael Preetz said.

"I am sorry if I gave the impression that I am not taking corona seriously. I want to apologize for that.

It showed Hertha's Jordan Torunarigha being tested by a physiotherapist who was wearing only a simple face mask as protection. The physiotherapist, David de Mel, repeatedly asked Kalou to "delete" the video, before the player walked away laughing, saying he was "only joking."
