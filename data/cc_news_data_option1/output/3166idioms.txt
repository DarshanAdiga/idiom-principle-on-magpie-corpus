Taylor's lawyer, John Drover, told the St. John's courtroom Tuesday that Newfoundland and Labrador is the first province to shut its borders to other Canadians, adding that a closer analysis is needed of mobility rights in Canada.
 He said the policy goes against the Constitution Act and the charter.
 "We have put up, basically, international borders without the right to do so," Drover said. "We live in weird times, no question, but this is way over the top."
 The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states every citizen has the right to enter, remain in and leave the country, and has the right to move to, and take up residence in, any province.
 Justice Donald Burrage mulled from the bench that the drafters of the charter could have included more specific wording guaranteeing entry into another province for reasons other than moving or working there.
 But Drover argued the mobility rights would have been considered self-evident.
 "I don't think any Canadian, or any politician, any lawyer or any judge has ever put to their mind that you could restrict Canadians from travelling around in Canada," Drover said.
 Justin Mellor, a lawyer for the province, said Tuesday Newfoundland and Labrador has constitutional authority to enact the policy because the ban addresses an issue of public health, placing it "squarely within provincial jurisdiction."
 He also argued the ban does not violate any mobility rights because the text of the charter does not explicitly address interprovincial mobility.
 Burrage questioned Mellor on whether the ban threatens confederation.
 "If you allow provinces to close their borders to each other, we don't have Canada, or at least some would say we don't," the judge said.

“The sheer numbers of people camping in undesignated sites are creating all kinds of negative, unsafe, gross and often illegal impacts,” Golding penned. “Hordes” of people are camping right on the outskirts of town and are especially problematic this year, she said.
 The short drive from Cody to the East Gate reveals large groups of campers in parking lots and pull outs, many of whom would have stayed in the park, said Kristie Salzmann, public affairs officer for the Shoshone National Forest.
 “We’re seeing people come into the area later in the day and just pull into turnouts and camp there overnight,” she said. “It’s just not something we have the personnel and capability to [enforce] because of the large amount of people and camping areas.”
 People are going to the bathroom in areas where they’ve chosen to illegally disperse camp for the night, Salzmann said.
 “We are seeing those sort of environmental impacts close to the highway and close to where people are recreating, you know, pull outs or areas where people often park to go down to the river and fish.”
 The litter will likely remain for the time being.
 “Because of the size of our forest, it’s just not feasible for us to patrol every single mile with people picking up litter,” she said. “That’s something we will never be able to do.”
 There are no dispersed camping areas immediately in the North Fork along the highway, Salzmann said. Those wishing to camp must be a half-mile from the center line of the highway, which means backpacking.
 All available camping spots are filling up every night. But even if you can’t camp at the sites, you can still use facilities at designated camping facilities.
 “Even people that aren’t staying at the campgrounds — if they’re just passing through on the way to Yellowstone or going on a hike — there are facilities available for their use,” Salzmann said. “The most important thing is to remember to recreate responsibly, and to be kind to the environment and one another.”
 “We are living in a different world,” she added. “We are seeing many more visitors to our area, especially to the forest, than we do in a typical year. If you pack it in, pack it out.”
 Golding suggests visitors need to learn ethical ways to camp in undesignated spots.
 “This not only means pack out all your trash, but also burying your human waste 6-inches deep and 200 feet from roads, trails, and water sources. Pack out or bury your toilet paper,” she said. “Trust me, no one wants to encounter anyone else’s poop or toilet paper, not to mention the diseases and water contamination human feces can cause.”

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The world is rebounding from the coronavirus shutdowns. China is up and running and Europe is bouncing back. Businesses that sell to the U.S are wondering and hoping when the U.S. economy will get back into the game. The U.S. fumbled its response to the virus, meaning some states reopened too early. The resurgence of COVID-19 contagions means the U.S. risks becoming one of the risks keeping the world economy back. Experts say the global recovery will take months and years so it needs all the help it can get. When that might be coming from the U.S. is anyone's guess.

Since it is written under disaster relief and emergency assistance law, Trump's plan also requires a new program to be created from scratch, separate from Pennsylvania's existing unemployment benefits programs, Wolf's administration said.
 "This is not something that any state will be able to do quickly," Wolf's administration said in a statement.
 Reducing the benefit from $600 a week to $400 a week will make it harder for families to get by during the pandemic, Wolf's administration said.
 It also places a larger financial burden on states, the administration said, noting that it has inquired about a federal loan as a precautionary measure.
 Pennsylvania had $3.4 billion in its unemployment compensation trust fund at the beginning of the year, according to federal figures.
 Between March 15 and last Friday, Pennsylvania paid out $24.2 billion in unemployment benefits. Of that, $4.2 billion was state dollars, leaving Pennsylvania with just under $715 million in its trust fund, Wolf's administration said.
 Wolf's administration said it has completed all of the prerequisite work to ensure it can borrow a 0% interest loan from the U.S. Department of Labor. At this point, Wolf's administration anticipates needing to secure the first loan by early September, it said.
 Just this year, Pennsylvania paid the final installment on $2.8 billion in bonds it issued in 2012 to retire a post-recession unemployment compensation debt that businesses owed to the federal government. The total debt service was $3.4 billion.

In a city in which about half of voters identify as Democrats and half as independents with very few Republicans, the June primary is everything. The current partisan system, activists say, gives a huge advantage to candidates put forth by the powerful South Jersey Democratic machine who get preferred ballot placement, while independents rarely participate in the primary at all.
 City lawmakers, said Sloan El, got Camden elections changed from nonpartisan to partisan in 2007, “by putting it on a ballot and telling everybody the city would save $80,000” by not having to hold an extra election.
 “But they were really doing it because it disenfranchises half the city of Camden,” said Sloan El.
 Independent voters, said Theo Spencer, a member of the petitioning group who is currently running for Camden’s school board, could vote in any primary by designating a party. “But if you’re an independent,” said Spencer, “you don’t even get any of the primary mail, so you don’t know. And in Camden, any little thing can be a disincentive when it comes to voting.” In a city of about 74,000, roughly 7,000 residents voted in last year’s November election.
 According to Rutgers’ public policy professor Julia Sass Rubin, New Jersey’s unique ballot design has for decades created the greatest inequity in partisan elections. Instead of placing competing candidates in a list beneath the office they seek, like in every other state and the District of Columbia, the ballots in 19 of 21 New Jersey counties feature a slate of candidates endorsed by the Democratic or Republican Party and presented as a vertical or horizontal line of names — dubbed the “county” or “party” line. Candidates not on that line are put in other columns or rows, sometimes far away in what Rubin calls “ballot Siberia.”
 “What this ballot does,” said Rubin, “is give the party chairs in most counties unbelievable control over who’s going to win the primary.” With one- party dominance in most of the state, she said, “you’re essentially placing people into office… So if you have the ability to decide who’s going to win, once they are elected, they are accountable to you, not the voters. And that’s essentially what happens in Camden.”
 Many of the activists involved in the current drive believe unfair ballot placement has contributed to their own unsuccessful candidacies in the city. “I ran four times, they put me in the end of nowhere,” said Mary Cortes, president of the Cramer Hill Residents Association. “It’s easy to just go down the column to vote, you could have a pervert or a murderer on there!”
 Currently, 14 of the largest 20 U.S. cities have nonpartisan elections — Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco among them — and in New Jersey, Newark, Trenton and Jersey City hold nonpartisan contests as well.
 Camden had nonpartisan elections from 1960 to 1992 and from 1996 to 2007 — when city leaders won a referendum to return to partisan elections, said Vance Bowman, one of this drive’s petitioners, because “we didn’t fight it. Nobody was paying attention.”
 In 2012, legendary Camden activist/lawyer, the late Frank Fulbrook led a petition drive for another referendum in an attempt to return to nonpartisan elections, but when he was hospitalized with a lung infection, the paperwork was submitted late. Camden lawmakers ruled that the group had missed the deadline for that year’s ballot, and that the question would appear on the 2013 ballot instead.
 Then, in 2013, petitioners accused the Camden County Democratic Committee of flooding the city with pamphlets claiming that efforts to make elections nonpartisan were part of a Republican conspiracy to take over Camden and demanded an apology. Fulbrook died in August. Two months later, residents voted to keep elections partisan.
 Camden Mayor Frank Moran sees no upside to nonpartisan elections. “In June and November elections,” he said, “the city isn’t footing the bill. When you have a totally separate nonpartisan election, the burden is solely on us.”
 Camden Councilman Angel Fuentes agrees. “Where do we find $100,000 for an extra election?” he asked. “It forces us to make substantial cuts to programs that are badly needed in the city of Camden.” Both men believe that having multiple elections in one year actually discourages voter turnout.
 The current petition drive, with 70 volunteers, began two months ago. The group needed to get a number of signatures equivalent to 25% of the voters in the last general assembly election, which amounts to about 1,750 names. Monday, they submitted them to the City Clerk in hopes of consideration at tonight’s City Council meeting.
 If council doesn’t vote to approve the change, it would once again become a ballot question in November.
 “They’re probably going to turn it down,” said Spencer, “because they benefit from the partisan election process.”
 Spencer, like the others in the group, believes that nonpartisan elections would force party-anointed candidates to work harder to get votes.
 “When you have a nonpartisan election,” Spencer said, “you have to walk the neighborhood. And some of the party candidates don’t really even live here!” The election would take place in May, he said, “so nobody can ride any coattails.”
 Petitioners were encouraged by last year’s ballot question that ultimately returned the city’s Board of Education to elected, rather than appointed office, a few seats at a time. That measure passed by a two-to-one margin, in spite of opposition from Mayor Moran and other sitting lawmakers. If the nonpartisan question passes, noted Spencer, law dictates that “it can’t be changed for ten years.”
 As they gather signatures, the group has also registered 175 new voters, many of them on probation or parole who didn’t realize recent legislation had granted them the right to vote. That was particularly satisfying for Ali Sloan El because he spent 18 months in prison after pleading guilty in 2007 to taking $36,000 in bribes for promising to steer public work to a contractor. “I’m one of them,” he said, “I’ve been there and back.” Sloan El can’t run for office again after pleading guilty, but he’s striving, he said, “to teach young people to get involved politically.”
 He dedicates this effort to his old friend Fulbrook, and is passionate about using nonpartisan elections to empower the Camden electorate.
 “When I explain to people signing the petition, they get it,” he said. “Now it’s your turn, I tell them, to control the mayor and City Council … they can pick a champion, we’re going to pick our champion, and we can duke it out!”
 Rutgers public policy professor and blogger Stephen Danley believes that if the question appears on the ballot this year or next, activists will face the task of convincing residents that nonpartisan elections could make a difference in their lives.
 “The Camden population,” said Danley, “is used to being disenfranchised, so there’s a high bar to show that new efforts would result in them getting their rights back.”
 Danley thinks nonpartisan elections would give a leg up to grassroots candidates, opening up what has been a daunting political landscape.
 “The biggest mystery in Camden,” Danley said, “is what Camden politics would look like if there wasn’t a ballot advantage for Democratic machine incumbents… It’s not clear that challengers have a ready-built coalition to take advantage of the change. But there’s no way to know until there’s a level playing field.”
 On August 8, Sloan El and Vance Bowman set up a folding table next to Tony’s Liquors on a run-down block of Mount Ephraim Avenue, and were exhorting passersby to sign the petitions.
 “What this does is stop them from controlling our City Council and the mayor,” Bowman told one. “It will make them hear you and listen to you. The last time we did this, we selected the first Black Mayor of Camden, Gwen Faison!”
 Former Camden Mayor Faison, now 95, believes that she would not have been elected in a partisan election.
 “I wasn’t recognized by my own party,” she said, “but I won, anyway … it was the good people who wanted to help others that helped me.”
 A few blocks away in his Parkside neighborhood, Theo Spencer was soliciting signatures door-to-door when he arrived at the home of Nataliece Moore, who was his eighth grade science teacher.
 Moore signed the petition.
 “The machine has always been an integral part of Camden’s history,” she said. As a result, Moore believes that many in the city have a “political malaise of not caring” and a belief that “it ain’t going to change, they’ve got it locked up.” It’s her history as a Black American, she said, that makes it impossible for her to succumb to apathy.
 “I’m voting,” said Moore, “because there’s been too many people hung from trees for me not to vote.”

A spokesman for prosecutors declined to comment.
 Maxwell is held without bail after U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan concluded days after her July arrest at a New Hampshire estate that she was a risk to flee.
 The lawyers also asked Nathan to order prosecutors to reveal the identities of three women whose claims of sexual abuse by Epstein and Maxwell in the 1990s formed the basis of charges against her.
 They said they need the identities to properly investigate their allegations of abuse at residences in New York, Florida, New Mexico and the United Kingdom.
 The women were not identified in an indictment in Manhattan federal court that charged Maxwell with recruiting and grooming them for abuse when they were under the age of 18. The indictment, to which Maxwell has pleaded not guilty, alleges that one victim was 14 when she was recruited.
 Maxwell's lawyers noted that Epstein is alleged to have abused dozens, if not hundreds, of girls and women so it would be hard to guess which women were working with prosecutors.
 The judge ordered prosecutors to respond to the letter from defence attorneys Mark Cohen Christian Everdell by Thursday.

With the Indians thrust into the COVID-19 spotlight with two starting pitchers breaking team protocol in Chicago, Browns running back Nick Chubb and cornerback Denzel Ward expressed confidence that their teammates will remain disciplined.
   
 But when asked Tuesday what worries him as the NFL tries to pull off a 2020 season, Chubb was candid.
   
 "My biggest concern is one person messing it up for everybody," Chubb said during a Zoom video conference with local media. "If one person gets sick, somehow he gets on the field with a lot more guys, he can spread it through that.
   
 "If everybody does our job, we have to test every morning, I think that wouldn't happen, anyways. But somehow if a guy slipped past a test and all that, that would worry me."
   
 With the Browns scheduled to hold their first full-team practice on Friday, Ward said he had no major concern at the moment.
   
 "I'm very confident. I feel we've got some smart guys on the team, guys that are going to take care of their business," Ward said. "The organization is doing a good job, just going through the protocols and keeping us sanitized, making sure we're keeping our mask on and everything. I feel like guys are going to do good as well once they get off the field and go home."
   
 Indians pitcher Zach Plesac had to be driven home by a car service after The Athletic reported he went out with friends following his start against the Chicago White Sox on Saturday. On Monday, the Indians released a statement that Mike Clevinger had also broken protocol while on the road trip. Both were quarantined and will undergo additional testing, with Clevinger missing his scheduled start Tuesday night at home against the Chicago Cubs.
   
 The Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals have seen multiple games postponed after COVID-19 outbreaks.
   
 Browns coach Kevin Stefanski has repeatedly said he believes they are creating their own bubble, but what worries many is what players will do when away from team headquarters. With preseason games canceled, the Browns will not travel until their Sept. 13 opener in Baltimore, but issues remain when they head home.
   
 Chubb believes his teammates can be trusted.
   
 "I think we're going to do a great job," Chubb said. "Coach Stefanski has told us, 'Do your part. If everybody does their part, we'll be OK.' I think our guys on the team understand that.
   
 "You have old veterans who know better, have been in the game awhile. You've got young rookies who want to make the team, they're going to do things right, too. I think if everybody does our part right, follow the protocol and the guidelines, I think we'll have a season."
   
 Chubb said Stefanski has sold the players on what must be done to handle the pandemic's challenges.
   
 "One of the things that stuck out to us when he came here, he said, 'You have to embrace the suck.' That is what we have been doing," Chubb said. "Nobody wants to wear a mask all day, nobody wants to take all this time just to go out on the field and play football, but it is where we are. You control what you can control, and that is what we have to do for now.
   
 "I think him being confident and telling us to embrace it has really led us all to see that this is the new normal for us and we have to get used to it. We want to play football so after this, we will."
   
 Concern for Buckeyes
   
 The fourth overall pick out of Ohio State in 2018, Ward thought the Big Ten had already pulled the plug on football this fall, confused about conflicting reports Monday. About three hours after he spoke, news broke that the Big Ten presidents and chancellors had voted to postpone the season until spring.
   
 Ward said he felt for fellow Buckeyes who would lose out on their final season in Columbus. Players expected to be selected high in the NFL Draft will likely opt out of a spring season.
   
 "It upsets me, but I know it upsets those guys a lot more," Ward said. "They are out there trying to prove themselves. If they have dreams of playing in the NFL and taking it to the next level, they wanted to show themselves this year, play with their guys and be out there on the field and making plays. I know that it's real difficult for those guys. Wish the best for those guys...."
   
 Technique change
   
 Ward was a Pro Bowl selection as a rookie, but that didn't keep new defensive coordinator Joe Woods and pass game coordinator/defensive backs coach Jeff Howard from tweaking Ward's technique.
   
 "One thing I like is they are critiquing my technique," Ward said of the new staff. "Right now, I am kind of trying to learn a new technique that I played in press coverage a little differently than the years past. I have been working on that. That is one thing that I appreciate so far from coach Woods and the rest of the staff."
   
 Ward said it was "a little bit" tough to change, but pointed out that part of the purpose was "not really being one dimensional."
   
 No disadvantage
   
 With no preseason games and the offseason being virtual, some believe NFL teams like the Browns with new coaching staffs will be at a disadvantage this season.
   
 Impressed with Stefanski, Chubb didn't really buy that notion.
   
 "We do have more veteran coaches. Even though they haven't been here, they have been around the league a while," Chubb said. "You definitely feel that when [you] come to the building with Stefanski. His first time being a head coach, I feel like he has been a head coach for many years. We all trust in him.
   
 "He has done a great job. He is very good at communicating, very good at expressing himself and how he feels. He is just a great coach and a great guy, and I am excited to get out there and get to know him more and get to play for him."
   
 Ward said Stefanski has found a way to build camaraderie despite the Zoom format, emphasizing the "four H's" -- history, hero, heartbreak and hope.
   
 "Getting to know guys, explaining our history and things about ourselves that we may have not known about our teammates," Ward said. "It's kind of an open table. He asked me, 'Would you be willing to speak to the team tonight?' so I talked to the team. He gives us a base of what he wants us to talk about. From there, we just expand on maybe our history, our heroes or whatever it is that we have on our heart at the moment."
   
 Special secondary?
   
 Ward and rookie cornerback Greedy Williams both missed four games last season with hamstring injuries, but Ward is excited about his pairing with LSU product Williams.
   
 "The sky's the limit for both of us. We go out there and do our job, play within the defense and make plays, and everything else is going to take care of itself," Ward said.
   
 Ward also likes the addition of second-round pick Grant Delpit, a safety.
   
 "He is definitely a fluid player, and he is definitely tough," Ward said. "You saw that last year at LSU. He had a hurt ankle that I feel a lot of people probably didn't even know about, but he played through it.
   
 "He is a tough player. He is going to bring that toughness here. He is just a fun guy to be around, in the locker room and everywhere else on the field."
   
 As for the potential for the Browns' secondary, which also includes safeties Karl Joseph and Sheldrick Redwine, Ward said, "I feel like we could be special."

Dear Dave,   My in-laws have very generously offered my wife and me $250,000 to help with a down payment on a home. I know the amount exceeds the IRS's yearly gift allowance, but they want to structure it as a family loan and have already told us they don't care if we pay it back. If we accept, we technically owe them a lot of money. If we say no, they may be offended. What do you think about this and how it might impact the relationship?   James
 Dear James,   Well, it makes sense your wife would be on board with the whole thing. It's her dad making the offer, so of course, she would be a lot more comfortable with the idea than you are.
 This is a big deal, and it's something you two should have a very serious conversation about. Get on the same page in every regard. Also, I'd recommend making sure you get everything in writing. See to it, as well, that it can be forgiven at the maximum allowable annual gift rate.
 In addition, in the event of death, make sure it's included in the estate, it's forgiven and there will be zero call on the note. In effect, that would make it an advance on your inheritance instead of debt. Under no circumstances should they, or any other heirs, have grounds to call the note.
 That's a good question, James. And a nice gift!   Dave
 Keeping the side hustle alive
    Dear Dave,   I have a full-time job, but I also have a side job providing firewood to help pay off debt. I make $600 to $1,000 a month with this project. My log splitter went down recently when a hydraulic line burst and the machine caught on fire. I'm not sure how much it will cost to get it going again. Should I invest in a new one that will increase my productivity and help me pay off debt faster?   Chris
 Dear Chris,   If I'm in your shoes, I'm going to fix the old one. Even if it means duct tape and glue, I'm going to try to find a way to repair it instead of spending a bunch of money or going deeper into debt.
 If you can't do that at a reasonable price out of pocket, I'd be in the market for a decent, used log splitter. And pay cash! I get your line of thinking when it comes to increasing productivity. Splitting wood is real work. But don't try to justify buying an expensive, new piece of equipment when it's just not necessary.
 If you're making that much with a side hustle, you can make your money back on a used splitter in a month or two - three at the most. Be smart about it, Chris!   Dave

Any organization functions absolutely well when all its employees, teams, and divisions work together as one cohesive unit. Teams are made up of diverse roles & individuals, and within that lies the strength of any particular team. Diverse talents, diverse temperaments, and many times, different priorities in individual capacities can come in the way of team goals. But, when channeled to work toward common goals, fostered with a common bond and irrigated with mutual transparency, these same differences can be turned into strengths for the team, to get to their goals with a mindset to make it happen. Thriving in diverse teams is the key to any individual accomplishment and pursuit of meaningful work in a world, that we continue to complicate in pursuit of simplicity.

"We know that we've got a lot further that we want to go, that we need to go in order to be a team that can really compete for the Stanley Cup," Holland said Tuesday on a video conference call with media.
 Fifth in the Western Conference at 37-25-9 when the NHL halted the season March 12 because of the advancing COVID-19 pandemic, the Oilers were poised to make post-season strides after two years of playoff-free hockey.
 The Blackhawks (32-30-8) arrived in Edmonton the NHL's 23rd seed out of 24.
 Chicago has enough Stanley Cup winners — a half-dozen own at least two rings if not three — to rise to the occasion, however.
 Edmonton led by a goal every game against Chicago, but often couldn't hold it. The hub-city hosts struck first in Game 1 before giving up four goals to the Blackhawks.
 Up 3-2 early in the third period of Game 3, the Oilers allowed two late goals in a loss. Tied 2-2 heading into the third in Game 4, Chicago produced the series winner to close it out Friday.
 "I thought in Game 1 we weren't ready to play," Holland said. "I thought that was a veteran team in the other locker room and they were up four-one 10 minutes into the game.
 "They knew the playoff series started when the puck dropped. It looked to me like we were going to try to wait into the series.
 "Every game we had a one-goal lead, but when we got those leads, we didn't hang on to them for any longer than three, four, five minutes."
 Edmonton got the necessary production out of its stars.
 Captain Connor McDavid led all scorers in the NHL's restart with five goals and four assists, including a hat trick in a Game 2 win.
 Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Leon Draisaitl combined for 14 points between them. But Edmonton allowed an average of four goals against in the series.

The Capitals are setting an example for the league's other 30 — soon to be 31 — teams by establishing a fund to eliminate cost barriers for minority youth players, expanding their relationship with the oldest minority youth hockey program in North America and its home rink, and educating current players and staff on diversity and matters of race.
 In all comes in the U.S. capital, which is the NHL market with the highest percentage of African-American residents. Capitals president Dick Patrick said the team consulted with players and alumnus Joel Ward and reached out to "Soul on Ice" filmmaker Kwame Damon Mason about what more could be done in the Washington area.
 "He basically said: 'It's not up to you to solve the big issues. Work on things that you can impact right away and go from there,' and I thought that was good advice," Patrick said. "The players can make statements about more global issues, but as far as actually having an impact, we have to see what we can get done really on a local basis."
 Goaltender Braden Holtby, who backstopped the Capitals to their first Stanley Cup title two years ago and was at the forefront of speaking out as a white hockey player, said now is the time to affect real chance.
 "The organization right from ownership down I think has the right mindset and the right beliefs behind it to really use our platform for positive change, not only in the D.C. area but everywhere," Holtby said.
 Carter, who had two brief stints in Washington, is on board because he believes other teams will follow the Capitals' blueprint. The former right wing from Toronto considers his role an opportunity to put a voice to concerns about racism in hockey and the world.
 In the first "Hockey Culture" episode that was filmed before the playoffs began, he and Reaves trade stories about being pulled over by police and the fear that accompanied them in those situations. Reaves spoke about being the son of a Manitoba Sheriff Service Sergeant and how he could still see problems within law enforcement while not believing all cops are bad.
 Four years after NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt to protest police brutality against minorities, Reaves made a point of saying he wasn't trying to disrespect the flag or those who have fought for freedom in the U.S. Seguin and Dickinson were even asked what cause they were supporting by kneeling — the one Reaves explained clearly.
 "Those people go across seas and they go to war and families are torn apart in these wars for the freedom of this country, only to come back and find out this country isn't free for everybody," he said. "I think that's where I'm coming from. Not everybody is truly free in this country, and I think it's starting to come to light a lot more right now."

He asked producer Walt Disney Television to reconsider making the episode available and, in recognition of "the importance of this moment, they listened and agreed," he said.
 The network and a representative for Barris did not respond to requests for comment Monday.
 The change of heart comes amid ongoing protests and calls for broad social change prompted by the death in May of George Floyd, a Black man, while in Minneapolis police custody.
 When ABC decided to pull the episode from the 2017-18 season and put it on ice, the network lauded "black-ish" for its deft examination of "delicate social issues" in an entertaining and educational manner. But "creative differences" over the episode couldn't be resolved, ABC said.
 The Emmy-nominated series has tackled thorny social issues during its ABC run, which began in 2014. That a streaming platform was deemed suitable for "Please Baby Please" reflects the creative freedom producers can gain outside the traditional confines of broadcasting.
 Barris remains executive producer of "black-ish" (and its spin-offs, ABC's "mixed-ish" and Freeform's "grown-ish"). But he is making new shows, including the edgy family comedy "#BlackAF," as part of a production deal with streamer Netflix.
 "Please Baby Please" joins the "black-ish" library of past seasons on Hulu.
 The episode revolves around a sleepless night in the household of Dre and Rainbow Johnson (Anthony Anderson, Tracee Ellis Ross). To calm his infant son during a storm, Dre begins by reading a children's book — the Spike Lee-Tonya Lewis Lee work of the episode's title — then shares his own anxieties.
 As Dre offers up an improvised fable, it's the actions of the then-fledgling Trump administration that are identified as part of his unease. His monologue includes a thinly veiled reference to "the shady king."
 The episode widens out to look at deep social divisions that Dre says followed the election of America's first Black president, Barack Obama, and the eye- opening revelation that "not everyone's a fan" of change, as the character puts it.
 "Daddy's scared too. ... Everything's so crazy now," Dre says softly to his son at one point.
 Through imagery and concerns expressed by other family members, the episode touches on issues besides racism, including mass shootings, climate change and gay rights.
 "Black-ish" has four nominations for next month's Emmys on ABC, including lead actor nods for Anderson and Ross.

For instance, presumably I _can_ watch or play anything on this TV, but what kind of content will work best on it? The press assets show off animals just chilling in the void. Xiaomi talks up its AI Master Smart Engine and the custom-made MediaTek 9650 chip for being able to intelligently optimize how the picture appears, but it doesn’t mention how it’s able to isolate objects from a background like the images show — if that’s even something it can do. Perhaps, it’s just showing some very high-resolution .png files, and for everything else, I could expect it to just have a slightly transparent quality to it, which I can’t say is something I’ve ever wanted. And even if you’re watching content that’s optimized for this screen, it’s possible that the dormant parts of the screen won’t be as crystal clear as you might hope it to be. LG showed off something similar in 2019 that was built for signage purposes, and the frame has a dark hue to it. Xiaomi’s press images actually reflect that the panel might be slightly darker, so this could be true to how it looks in person.

And, best of all for Richmond bathtub fans, Ruiz said the famed bathtub that once held the salad bar at Strawberry Street Cafe for years is making a comeback. It's been in storage at a private residence in Henrico County since last year.
 "It's nostalgia and respect for the place that was there for 40 years," Ruiz said of returning the bathtub to 421 N. Strawberry St.
 Ruiz doesn't yet know how he'll be using the bathtub, possibly to hold ice and beer, but knows it'll be incorporated in some way inside the restaurant before opening.
 He hopes to have the restaurant open in the fall and will be relocating his family from his native Mexico, perhaps as early as this month to begin work on the tapas and beer restaurant.
 He's mindful, though, that the COVID-19 pandemic could slow his plans for the new spot; he's been attempting to follow the state's business opening guidelines from Mexico to ensure he's up to speed and ready for whatever awaits him when he's finally ready to open the restaurant's doors.
 "The restaurant business has changed," he said.
 Ruiz has more than 30 years of restaurant experience, most recently working for chains, such as Señor Frog's, a Mexican-theme bar and grill restaurant in resort towns throughout Mexico.

Our Board of Directors believes that equity incentives are important tools in motivating the performance of our officers, key employees and directors. As of April 23, 2020, 113,003 shares are available for grant of future equity awards under the 2016 Plan. The Board of Directors has approved, subject to stockholder approval, an amendment of the 2016 Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2016 Plan by 7,000,000 shares for a total number of shares authorized for issuance thereunder equal to 7,113,003 shares of common stock. The Board of Directors anticipates, based upon modeling and testing at various potential stock prices and assuming we continue to grant awards consistent with our current practices and historical usage, that this proposed increase in the number of authorized shares is sufficient to cover those annual awards made to members of the Company's senior executive team in 2020, but conditioned upon receipt of stockholder approval of this proposed amendment to the 2016 Plan and, in addition thereto, equity awards under the 2016 Plan through December 31, 2022.

Students at the Fierce Motions in Dance studio in Van Alstyne were finally able to perform Aug. 2 at their long-awaited annual recital.
   
 The event is usually held at Van Alstyne High School, but that was not possible this year due to COVID-19. Plan B was to have an outdoor performance, but insurance issues nixed that as well.
   
 Studio owner Donna Kramer-Almon approached city leaders about hosting an indoor event.
   
 "I talked it over with the city and the mayor, and they were fantastic," she said. "We decided that we could keep the (attendance) numbers low."
   
 Pulling off the event during a pandemic required lots of improvisation. The show was held in an upstairs space above the dance studio that would have been under construction if the pandemic hadn't changed everything.
   
 Dancers were split among four different performances to keep the gatherings small. Audience members were spaced six feet apart to meet safety protocols, and all of the performances were streamed live on Facebook.
   
 In the spring, the studio was closed for 10 weeks. That left only eight weeks for students to prepare.
   
 "They were all troopers," Kramer-Almon said.

The number of people flying on commercial jetliners is down 75% from last summer, but the rate of those getting caught either inadvertently or deliberately trying to bring a gun on board is soaring.
 Transportation Security Administration officers are finding guns in carry on bags at security checkpoints at a rate three times higher than they did last summer. And 80% of those guns are loaded.
 The TSA reports that officers seized more than 300 guns from backpacks, shoulder bags, purses and other carry on baggage in July, a rate of 15.3 guns for every one million people screened. That's compared to a rate of 5.1 guns per million people screened in July of last year.
 The rate is "particularly alarming, given that TSA screened about 75% fewer passengers in July 2020, over the previous year's volume," the agency said in a news release.
 "Even more concerning is that 80 percent of the firearms coming into the checkpoint are loaded," TSA Administrator David Pekoske said. "It's just an accident waiting to happen."
 The number of people going through airport security screening checkpoints hit a five-month high this past weekend, with nearly 832,000 people screened across the country on Sunday. That's the most people passing through TSA checkpoints since March 17, but it's still close to 70% fewer people than on the same Sunday last August.

Qualcomm has won its appeal to overturn last year’s antitrust verdict in a case brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, potentially ending a bitter saga that threatened the San Diego company’s lucrative patent licensing business.
 A three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday reversed U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh’s ruling last year that Qualcomm violated anti- monopoly laws in the way it licenses patents.
 The panel also threw out Koh’s worldwide permanent injunction prohibiting Qualcomm from certain business practices, which could have reduced the company’s incentives to invest in next-generation wireless technologies such as 5G.
 The 9th Circuit’s rejection of Koh’s ruling marks a victory for the way Qualcomm gets paid for investing in research and development, which came under attack in lawsuits brought by the FTC and Apple in early 2017.

Those new locations are scattered throughout the city — some of them in the inner suburbs that are far from their downtown support services.
 Mary-Anne Bedard, Toronto's general manager of shelter, support and housing administration, said she understands the concerns of people in the midtown area.
 "This is a neighbourhood that previously hasn't had a shelter, so they're not necessarily used to seeing these types of people," she said. "It is a fact of daily life for many people right across the city — it is a fact that community needs to come to terms with."
 Bedard said the city does not need a neighbourhood's permission to place a shelter there. She said the city usually finds a new location for a shelter, then informs the community and listens to their concerns before it opens.
 But due to the pandemic, that process was reversed, and Bedard is asking for compassion from the neighbourhood.
 Lorraine Lam, an outreach worker at Sanctuary Ministries Toronto, a downtown drop-in centre, said the city should have consulted with the neighbourhood earlier.
 "These shelters were very reactive — the need to get people out of the tents and get them out of public sight," she said. "Now these shelters have opened up and are basically warehouses with little supports."
 Lam said there are several organizations in the area that could help, including numerous churches and the Out of the Cold program, which have experience dealing with the homeless.
 However, Lam said she believes the community will come around through engagement and education.
 "I think a lot of it might come from fear and not knowing the other side," she said.
 "There needs to be conversations to help the neighbourhood understand."
 The city has scheduled a community engagement meeting next week.

LSU coach Ed Orgeron told WNXX-FM, 104.5's "Off the Bench" on Tuesday morning that "the easiest thing to do right now is say no" to a football season.
 "But we want to compete for our players and find out what’s best for them," Orgeron said. "Now, at the end, if our players can’t play, I’m not going to put them in harm's way and they know that."
 Orgeron has long insisted that LSU can play football safely. He joined Vice President Mike Pence in Tiger Stadium in mid-July and said "I don't think we can take this away from our players, take this away from our state and our country. We need football. Football is the lifeblood of our country."
 Orgeron also appeared on Fox News on Tuesday, his third appearance this year, and said "there's no plan B here at LSU" and the team is "going forward ahead."
 Coronavirus still has a significant hold in Louisiana. On Tuesday, the Louisiana Department of Health reported 1,164 new cases and 26 deaths.

 "Bro coronavirus is real," wrote Moore, who recorded three tackles, a half tackle for loss and half a sack in 2019.
