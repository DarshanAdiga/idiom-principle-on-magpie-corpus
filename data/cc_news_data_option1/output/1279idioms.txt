First-year Mississippi State coach Mike Leach has made a career out of churning out quarterbacks with video game numbers while leading Texas Tech and Washington State. In his first offseason at Mississippi State, he's reeled in one of the biggest fish in the 2021 quarterback pond.
 Four-star quarterback Sawyer Robertson announced his intent to sign with the Bulldogs on Twitter on Tuesday night. The 6-foot-3.5, 190-pound pro-style signal-caller from Coronado High School in Lubbock, Texas, is the ninth-ranked pro-style quarterback and No. 163 overall player in the Class of 2021.

Furthermore, LiDAR is just the icing on the cake. We already know Apple has equipped all iPhone 12 models with a potentially revolutionary A14 chipset, stolen the iPad Pro’s buttery smooth ProMotion refresh rates and is displaying them on Samsung’s post-Galaxy S20 OLED panels. 5G is also a given, though it may stand out as well because Apple is currently building custom 5G antennas.

Cynics will suggest that the support for LiDAR is not there yet. But this is exactly why Apple has released the sensor early in the 2020 iPad Pro line-up. The strategy should mean that when the iPhone 12 launches (and it remains Apple’s most important product - by far), it can hit the ground running thanks to a large number of transformative AR and VR tools and games. Just imagine a LiDAR-optimised version of Pokemon Go.

Although one Grand Island day care has closed for the time being, other facilities contacted Tuesday are still operating under the conditions of Directed Health Measures.
 The Teaching Tree has closed for this week, said owner and director Steph Allen. Other child care operations still in operation include the YWCA, the YMCA, St. Pauls Lutheran Church, St. Mary’s Cathedral Daycare and Cherry Park Creative Corner. The list is not meant to be comprehensive.
 Allen closed The Teaching Tree’s child care and preschool temporarily because she wanted to make sure that the families she serves and her employees are safe. With community spread of the coronavirus present in Grand Island, “I just thought that was the safest thing to do for my families that I take care of and my staff and myself,” she said.

PRINCETON – The Mercer County Commission issued a notice Tuesday extending the closure of the county courthouse, courthouse annex, animal shelter and Glenwood Park in light of President Trump's declaration that social distancing orders will continue until April 30.
 The county commission closed county facilities when Gov. Jim Justice and the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals called for public facilities to close. County Commissioner Bill Archer said that the commission's original order was scheduled to end at midnight Tuesday.
 "The change is that our previous emergency declaration indicated closing through the month of March," Archer said. "Should the Supreme Court extend their closing and/or the governor to match up with the president's declaration, then we'll meet again in emergency session to modify our emergency order. Our extension just continues until April 10 at midnight."
