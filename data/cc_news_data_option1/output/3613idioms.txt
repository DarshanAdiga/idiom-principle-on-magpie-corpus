He has dozens of tapes. There are probably things in the very first tape that could/should have been released. If he had released it Trump would have cut off access then and there never would have been the tape on the virus. We wouldn't be having this controversy over what Trump said behind closed doors about the virus because we wouldn't know. Woodward isn't my favorite journalist but different journalists do different things. Woodward is writing a book about a person's behavior over a year, not weekly articles. If we think there is any value in a long term expos√© then we have to allow reporters to hear bad information without expecting them to immediately reveal it.

Rather than release information that might have saved thousands of lives if revealed at the time when it could do so; Woodward held it back until it benefited him personally. That makes Woodward as big a scumbag, in my book, as Trump.

I responded to an apology for Woodward's actions, which definitely do raise ethical questions, by noting that it was an apology. Doing so, apologizing for him that is, has the effect of letting Woodward off the hook for his ethical lapse and one which does ignore the enormity of what was revealed too late to do any good for anyone besides Woodward.
