"I've always wanted a frame of reference," Jones told The Billings Gazette. "I'm the guy who takes the window seat in a plane," allowing him to look out and track the familiar parts of the landscape below.
 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Jones had some extra time on his hands. So he scouted around for a photo of the Beartooth Mountains to start his project. When he didn't find what he wanted, he drove to the top of the Billings Rimrocks, snapped his own photos and stitched them together for a panoramic view.
 In seeking reference material to identify the mountains, Jones came across backpacker and peak bagger Matt Lemke's website, lemkeclimbs.com. The site lists mountains Lemke has scaled in 12 states, two Canadian provinces as well as overseas. In the Beartooths, Lemke lists more than 20 areas he's visited.
 Much of that information was gathered when he spent a summer working in Red Lodge, as well as after college when he dedicated more than two months to exploring the mountains. Lemke climbed all 27 of the 12,000-foot high peaks. Along the way, he took numerous photos and notes, posting the information on his website.
 "It's still my favorite part of Montana," Lemke said.
 After swapping information with Lemke via email, Jones decided he needed a better photo to work with on his project. He searched the internet and came across Gazette photographer Larry Mayer's Oct. 15, 2017, aerial view of the Beartooths.
 In his 43 years at The Gazette, Mayer has taken hundreds of photos of the Beartooth Mountains from a variety of angles. The photo Jones came across was taken from the Lockwood area with the city in the foreground. It was an unusually clear day following a cold front that had passed through, clearing the sky of any haze, Mayer said.
 With Mayer's photo in hand, Jones decided to up the ante. In addition to naming the visible peaks taller than 11,500 feet in the photo, he decided to also name some of the prominent ones that were just out of sight. All told, the modified photo identifies about two dozen peaks, Jones said.
 "I'm just a curious guy who got it started," he said, "a bored old guy on a computer."

WASHINGTON (AP) — It didn't take the Supreme Court long to make short work of what President Donald Trump called "the big one."
 And as the court on Friday rejected a Texas-based lawsuit to overturn the election results, not even Trump's three high court appointees were willing to rise to the defense of the president. Trump has been clinging to baseless claims of fraud in the hope of reversing election results that made Democrat Joe Biden the next president and deprived Trump of four more years in the White House.
 For all Trump's predictions that the court and his justices would make things right, he and his supporters were lacking one basic element: a strong legal argument that might plausibly attract some sympathy on a court now dominated by conservative justices.

ATLANTA (AP) — President Donald Trump has relentlessly promoted false claims that the election was rigged against him, and some of his allies have gone as far as calling for voters to skip Georgia’s Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections in protest. Those are alarming words for the GOP campaigns that are banking on a strong turnout to win the two Senate seats on the ballot. But interviews with voters and GOP activists in the state suggest there’s little sign that Trump’s voters are planning to stay home in protest. Most Republican voters interviewed were prepared to put their skepticism aside to vote for GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in their races against Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.

Khalil Mack popped up with the football in one hand and led a herd of Chicago Bears defensive players to the Soldier Field end zone to pose, arms crossed and muscles flexed, in front of a CBS camera.
 The 35-yard sprint for a 10-second celebration didn’t seem over the top for a Bears defense in need of a spark after two straight weeks of poor performances.
 A week after Mack didn’t show up in the defensive stats against the Detroit Lions except for a sack wiped out by a teammate’s penalty, the Bears outside linebacker made sure his imprint was visible Sunday in the 36-7 victory over the Houston Texans.
 The group photo celebration came after he ripped the ball from running back Duke Johnson on the Texans’ second drive and jumped on it for a fumble recovery. He also sacked Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson in the end zone for a second-quarter safety.

Christina Chiger, a 33-year-veteran nurse's aide at a nursing home in Tampa, Florida, is exhausted and frightened after a relentless nine months that left two dozen residents dead and made 16-hour shifts common. But she has no plans to take the vaccine, for now at least.
 "Will there be side effects? Will it actually work?" she asked. "If we all get sick from taking this, who's going to take care of our patients?"
 Resistance to the vaccine in nursing homes is not entirely unexpected -- about 3 in 10 staffers, and 2 in 10 residents were not vaccinated for the flu last year, for example -- but it's no less worrisome.
 Given how easily COVID-19 spreads, particularly in communal settings, experts believe around 70% of the population will need to receive the vaccine for it to be successful.
 "Nursing home staff has always been a challenge to vaccinate," said Litjen Tan, chief strategist at the advocacy group Immunization Action Coalition. "We're cutting it close."
 Cultural issues could also be at play. People of color make up a majority of aides and other frontline workers in nursing homes, and some minorities express mistrust of medicine that experts see linked with past abuses.
 A poll released last week by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found Black and Hispanic people in the U.S. are far less likely than white people to agree to be vaccinated. Some 53% of whites said they would get the shots, compared with 24% of Blacks and 34% of Hispanics.
 The AP-NORC poll also found women were less likely than men to say they would be vaccinated. An estimated 9 in 10 front-line nursing home workers are women. Overall, about a quarter of U.S. adults said they would refuse to get a vaccine, and another quarter said they weren't sure.
 "They don't trust it. They don't trust the science," said Lori Porter, who heads the health assistants group and blames the Trump administration for making faith in science a political issue and undermining his own experts. "There's so much misinformation that has circled over this pandemic this whole year that they don't feel they can trust anyone."
 The federal government is seeking to blunt such attitudes with a $250 million ad campaign set to roll out this week that will eventually target healthcare workers and vulnerable groups. The pitch touts how vaccines will help beat COVID-19 the same way they defeated smallpox, measles and polio.
 "One of the great triumphs of medical science ... has been vaccinations," Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease scientist, said in one video.
 The American Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes, has called for every resident and staff member to get both vaccine doses by March 1, even though it expects no federal or state mandates requiring shots.
 "Our hope is that we get widespread acceptance of the vaccine," said AHCA's president, Mark Parkinson. "But if we don't, I assure you that our organization as well as individual operators will be analyzing whether or not they can mandate the vaccine. We're just hoping that we don't have to go there."
 John Sauer, head of the Wisconsin branch of LeadingAge, which represents non- profit long-term care facilities, said the misery most residents and workers have already witnessed should be all the convincing they need. "They know that this could literally be a life-and-death situation."
 No reliable gauges of nursing home residents' opinion on the coronavirus vaccine have emerged. Among older adults in general, the AP-NORC poll found greater acceptance of the vaccine than among younger people.
 But fears persist among many older people, over the possibility of bad interactions for people already on a long list of drugs, or of undiscovered problems specific to their age group.
 As with many vaccines, the drug companies say recipients may experience fever, fatigue or sore arms from the injection. Authorities are investigating several allergic reactions reported in Britain by health workers with a history of severe allergies.
 Penelope Ann Shaw, a 77-year-old nursing home resident in Braintree, Massachusetts, said she plans to refuse the vaccine, as she does with annual flu shots, because of drug allergies and her concerns about how little is known about the new coronavirus drugs.
 "For me, I think it's a little premature," said Shaw, who has Guillain-Barre syndrome, an immune system disorder, and was the lone long-term care resident to serve on the federal Coronavirus Commission for Safety and Quality in Nursing Homes. "You're not doing it with me."
 After a year in which many facilities have walled off to the world, crippling some residents in isolation, and leading to medical declines and deaths in others, some need no convincing.
 Among them is 85-year-old Harriet Krakowsky, a resident of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale in New York City, who had friends killed by the virus and is still waiting for visitation restrictions to ease so she can meet two great- grandchildren who were born this year.
 "For the first time in six or seven months," she said, "there's a little light at the end of the tunnel."

BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — At the winter meeting of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, Lori Roberts introduced a new tool to keep the peace between grizzly bears and humankind — "bear smart communities," inspired by the model used in British Columbia, Canada.
 Roberts, of Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and chair of IGBC's information, education and outreach committee, said the ski town of Big Sky has already adopted a "bear smart" program, and that spreading the effort to grizzly country in the lower 48 would be coordinated by British Columbia experts, local non-profit People and Carnivores, and the IGBC.
 The IGBC's purpose is to ensure recovery of viable grizzly bear populations in the lower 48, and is made of representatives from the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Geological Survey. Representatives come from all over grizzly territory, from Canada to Yellowstone, and out to the Pacific Northwest, the Billings Gazette reported.

Meanwhile, UTEP veered dramatically in the opposite direction, shifting the lion’s share of instruction online and restricting in-person student functions with the hope that strict precautions would ultimately lead to a faster return to normal life.
 “The message (was): Let’s get through this semester,” said Guillermina Gina Núñez-Mchiri, women’s studies professor and faculty senate president at UTEP. “You’re not going to miss out on your entire university experience. We’re just going to get through this period right now that is really impacting our community quite badly.”
 So far, UTEP has mostly kept the virus off campus while its community has been hammered. Students and staff accounted for 2% of all new cases in the county between Aug. 24 and Nov. 22, according to a Texas Tribune analysis. University President Heather Wilson credited the school’s proactive testing of asymptomatic students and minimal on-campus activity.
 At Texas Tech — a more populous school where students make up a larger percentage of the county population — 13% of new cases reported in the county were from students and staff between the start of school and Nov. 20. Administrators said contact tracing showed none of that transmission has been traced back to the classroom, which they believe shows their plan was a success, too. They said large off-campus gatherings, where the university had less control over student behavior, contributed to the spread among students.
 While both universities offered free on-campus testing to students and staff, neither campus required testing, which experts say makes it difficult to truly determine spread of the virus among the student body.
 Heading into the spring, with a semester of pandemic data and experience behind them, presidents at both universities plan to stay the course, saying they’re largely satisfied with the results of the safety precautions employed at their respective universities.
 At the same time, health experts warn the worst is yet to come as case numbers and hospitalizations nationwide are expected to intensify as a result of holiday gatherings, deepening pandemic fatigue and as school sports and extracurriculars are pushed inside because of cold weather.
 “I think this semester has not been perfect,” said Texas Tech President Lawrence Schovanec. “But students have still had the opportunity to continue their education with some of the traditional experiences they truly value. ... We’re in a situation if you strive for perfection, you may just be paralyzed.”
 From the beginning of the fall semester, Texas Tech set itself apart from other major state universities, charging ahead with fewer restrictions on in- person activities than its peers.
 Texas Tech offered 70% of classes partially or fully in person, much more than other public universities like the University of Texas at Austin, where only 25% of classes were in person or a hybrid. Texas Tech also bucked national trends and allowed tailgating to continue before football games, which had fewer spectators. This weekend, the school will host in-person commencement ceremonies at its indoor arena.
 It was during the early weeks of the semester that Texas Tech saw the largest spike of new cases as students returned and immediately started socializing off campus.
 Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city of Lubbock, saw one of those gatherings down the street from her house, with 60 to 70 young adults gathered at a party. Few were social distancing or wearing masks. She called the police to break it up.
 “But I wondered, did I scatter the virus to 10 more parties?” she said.
 The early surge in local cases was mostly among 18- to 24-year-olds, Wells said, but it spread to other age groups in subsequent weeks.
 “There was a lot more activity in that age group of getting together that let the virus replicate, and it really spread throughout the rest of the community,” Wells said.
 At its peak, 415 Texas Tech students tested positive for the virus in one week in late August. Other schools across the country have responded to smaller outbreaks with more drastic action. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill shut down campus for the entire semester after 130 students tested positive. The University of Notre Dame went entirely remote for two weeks when 147 people tested positive.
 “I kept waiting for that checklist of things, that if one of these things happens we’re shutting it down,” said Elissa Zellinger, a Texas Tech English professor who taught online this semester but went to campus to work from her office. “That may have been a fantasy on my part. But that never happened.”
 Instead, she said, administrators announced at the first faculty senate meeting of the semester that it would take an “extraordinary number” of cases to shut down the university.
 Administrators at Texas Tech insist the school is meeting the demands of students and parents who want a regular campus experience. But some employees at the university felt like more could have been done to prioritize safety.

All the government needs to do is to walk the talk, by deploying resources to putting the roads back in shape. Cases are rife about haulage companies who after loading goods for clients will receive calls some few hours later that their truck has tilted over, and all the content spilt at bad spots of the road. Though there are many factors that could be responsible for this, the major cause of trucks tilting or containers falling off from trucks are bad spots on the roads, especially potholes that were allowed to fester through neglect into becoming craters and gullies that are common features on our roads.

"He's got a plate of Biblical plagues staring him in the face," said Garry South, who was Davis' chief political adviser.
 Still, South sees Newsom in a far stronger position to survive a challenge compared to the political climate 17 years ago when Davis was pushed out. A Republican hasn't won a statewide race in California in 14 years, and there is no Hollywood superstar emerging as a potential candidate.
 "A recall (election) is never good, obviously," South said. But "the Republicans are in a far weaker position" than in 2003.
 For the telegenic, 53-year-old Newsom, a recall election could unsettle a political ascendancy that many see aimed for the White House. A closer-than- expected race could hurt the former San Francisco mayor's national profile as well as make him look vulnerable for 2022, when he is expected to seek a second term.
 Newsom's challenging year already has encouraged Republicans who have signaled they are likely candidates, including former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and Newsom's 2018 rival, businessman John Cox.
 Recall organizer Orrin Heatlie, a retired county sheriff's sergeant, predicted they would gather the needed signatures, though added an infusion of cash would help.
 State records show just under 300,000 signatures have been filed, though Economy said another 500,000 are in the pipeline with county election officials.
 The group began gathering signatures in June and have about three months to hit the required 1,495,709 signatures. They will need a surplus since some signatures are sure to be disqualified.
 The 2003 recall took off after Republican U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, a car-alarm magnate, poured $1.7 million of his fortune into the campaign to get the proposal on the ballot.
 Organizers this year estimate they would need $2.8 million to hire professionals to gather another 800,000 signatures, at a price of $3.50 each.
 State records show Cox donated $50,000 to the recall campaign in October, but at this point he has no plans to invest more.
 "I'm not going to be Darrell Issa," he said. "If there were a whole bunch of other people that stepped up and helped, I'd probably help some more."
 If he faces a recall, Newsom would have advantages. He would have no donation limits on his fundraising, opening the way for a record flood of cash to defend his seat. Democrats have a nearly 2-to-1 advantage in registered voters.
 The potential election could also increase the chances he picks longtime friend and Secretary of State Alex Padilla to fill the U.S. Senate seat that will be vacated by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Facing uncertainty, Newsom needs a loyalist in Washington who will embrace his priorities, including securing federal funds for the virus and wildfires.
 Newsom's advisers are carefully watching the signature count and depict the effort as a President Donald Trump-inspired tactic to alter the election calendar in hopes of gaining political advantage.
 Voters, they say, want the governor to remain focused on the pandemic.
 "There are a lot of ambitious Republicans who want to be governor but would rather not play by the rules," Newsom political strategist Dan Newman said.
 State Democratic Party Chairman Rusty Hicks said in a statement that "the California Republican Party continues to demonstrate how disconnected they are from the plight and pain of working families."
 If it qualifies, state rules are not specific on when the election would occur. Recall organizers hope the date would be scheduled in July or August.
 Former top Davis aide Susan Kennedy warned that "you just can't underestimate the depth of people's anger" but added that Newsom has time to recast his legacy.
 "He will be defined not by the shutdowns and not by the crisis, he will be defined by the vaccine distribution and the recovery," she said.

Over the last 10 years, Maryland’s Department of Juvenile Services has seen a decline in admissions into its seven detention facilities across the state, but the number of Black children admitted is still disproportionately high.
 The number of children admitted into juvenile detention facilities has gone from 7,494 in the 2009 fiscal year to 2,406 in fiscal year 2019, according to Maryland’s Department of Juvenile Services.
 The department believes the decline in admissions to detention facilities is due to its ability to divert children to various youth programs instead of facing the juvenile justice system, while utilizing Alternative to Detention methods — such as ankle monitors — so that children can avoid being detained as they wait for an adjudicatory hearing.
 Even though the population has decreased, Black children continue to make up the majority of the youth within the facilities.
 During the three fiscal years ending in 2019, Black kids represented around 77% of the juvenile detention center admissions whereas white children made up less than 18% and Hispanic children made up 6-7 %. According to 2019 Census Data, 31.6% of Maryland children between the ages of 5 and 17 are African American. Meanwhile, 41.4% are white and 15.5% are Hispanic.
 “What I see are alarm bells,” Maryland Secretary of Juvenile Services Sam Abed told Capital News Service. “When you see unfairness and [youth] not being treated fairly, it’s a call to action to develop strategies to combat it.”
 The Department of Juvenile Services has been trying to find ways to fight its disparity issues and lower its admission numbers among its detention centers by diverting children to various educational and mentoring programs, but there’s still more work to be done, Abed said.
 “The key for us is to be vigilant and continue our efforts,” Abed said. “We made some progress and that’s good, but there’s a history of trying to make progress and failing.”
 Racial disparities remain because a child may be viewed differently by law enforcement due to their background, and crime in the neighborhood they grow up in, said Gary Ivory, a senior executive officer for the Youth Advocate Program.
 The Youth Advocate Program is a non-profit organization that works with the Department of Juvenile Services to reduce the number of delinquency charges and help keep youth out of juvenile detention centers. It sends advocates into neighborhoods to assist children and their families while offering various programs and mental health care to those who are transitioning out of detention.
 “You have a higher likelihood of getting arrested just based on the ZIP code you are living in and that’s across the United States,” said Ivory, who has worked for the Youth Advocate Program for 22 years. “I think that’s something you can’t solve overnight.”
 Abed has seen misdemeanors and other lesser-offense crimes make up a good amount of the intake cases among African-American children.
 Abed said he feels children who commit these crimes should receive help instead of being locked up in juvenile facilities.
 “For low-level offenses, we should not be using incarceration. That shouldn’t be an option,” Abed said. “What we are trying to do is not punish kids, but change their behavior. We don’t need to use a criminal justice response to change the behavior.”
 In the 2019 fiscal year, 69.2% of the intake cases among children of color statewide were misdemeanor crimes while 13% were crimes of violence, 9.4% were felonies, 0.4% were ordinance offenses, 6.5% were citations and 1.5% were described as “Child in Need of Supervision.”
 Eric Ford, director of the Choice Program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, a non-profit organization that provides mentoring and support to youth in their communities, said he thinks the presence of police in predominantly black neighborhoods and schools has contributed to the racial disparities.
 Over the last three years, 90% of the referrals of youth of color came from police, whereas fewer than 3% came from citizens and adult court transfers, according to the Department of Juvenile Services.
 “To me, communities of color tend to be over-policed,” Ford said. “So when a young person makes a poor decision, it becomes a police issue rather than an adolescent issue.”
 Baltimore juvenile defense attorney Jenny Egan grows enraged every time she sees the over-incarceration of black children, as she believes it has a negative impact mentally and emotionally.
 “An arrest and being put into a cage for an adolescent child is traumatic and life-altering,” Egan said. “If we want children to successfully transition into adulthood, we need to show them in every step that they matter and they deserve the very best, and that is not what we are giving them right now.”
 According to Abed, the department also uses peace circles and community conferencing, which allow youth to hear and understand how their actions have impacted others.
 For over 30 years, the Department of Juvenile Services has been partners with Choice, a diversion program that allows youth to participate in community service and educational activities while receiving mental health resources and college and career readiness training.
 “Programs like Choice are extremely important because it gives young people the opportunity to make mistakes without those mistakes becoming criminal,” Ford said. “We step in with the goal to get them out of the juvenile justice system.”
 In the 2019 fiscal year, Choice program teams in Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Howard County, Montgomery County, and Prince George’s County served a combined 672 children, with 531 being Black children. Out of the children who were served, 98% of them didn’t receive a new charge.
 The Department of Juvenile Services announced on Oct. 20 that it received a $130,000 grant from the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention, Youth, and Victim Services to bring Multisystemic Therapy to Baltimore City.
 Multisystemic Therapy includes community-based programs geared toward providing therapy to youth and young adults regarding mental health, family engagement, and workforce and educational needs while helping youth and families address behaviors linked to traumatic experiences.
 These programs are meant to serve as alternatives to commitment while trying to deal with the racial and ethnic disparities in Baltimore City’s juvenile justice system.
 Last year, 96.1% of the admitted kids in the Baltimore City Juvenile Justice Center were Black meanwhile whites, and Hispanics and other races were a combined 4%, according to the Department of Juvenile Services. In 2019, about 71% of children between the ages of 5-17 who lived in Baltimore City were African American, while 15.1% were white and 9.3 percent were Hispanic, according to Census data.
 “These programs will not only help divert youth from entering the juvenile system but also provide us with one more tool to reduce the racial disparities we face,” Abed said in a statement.
 Egan said she hopes the department will continue to find more ways to solve the racial disparities that have plagued the juvenile justice system in Maryland for years.
 “This is something Black communities have been fighting for ages and I hope we take this opportunity to finally draw a line in the sand,” said Egan. “We have to treat our children like children. That’s my hope.”

In a surprise move, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed that negotiations between both sides should continue beyond the deadline, Xinhua news agency reported.      After a "constructive and useful phone call" with Johnson, von der Leyen said in a statement late Sunday that despite the fact that deadlines have been missed over and over, "we both think it is responsible at this point to go the extra mile".      Further negotiations will take place in Brussels, von der Leyen said, adding that it remains to be seen if an agreement can be reached even "at this late stage".      The development raised hopes on both sides of the English Channel, that at the 11th hour, a future trading deal between both sides started to appear on the horizon.      Despite the last-minute extension, Johnson said both sides remain "very far apart on key issues".

Interestingly, the governor hit the ground running. He started tackling the insecurity pervading the state as soon as he was sworn in. Days into his administration, the governor suspended two traditional rulers - Emir of Maru, Alhaji Abubakar Cika Ibrahim and the district head of Kanoma, Ahmad Lawal - over their alleged involvement in banditry. Shortly after, the governor met with President Muhammadu Buhari and requested the support of the Federal Government in his efforts to rid the state of bandits. He also met with security chiefs. The governor then reached out to the bandits, many of whom have since repented and surrendered their arms. At the moment, relative peace now reigns in a state hitherto bedevilled by acute insecurity.
