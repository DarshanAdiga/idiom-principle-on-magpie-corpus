 A ruptured gas line set off a fire that damaged a house on Erie's west side early Monday morning.
 The fire was reported at 1202 Brown Ave. on Monday at about 2 a.m., according to Erie County 911. Erie fire officials said there was a gas leak at the residence and a gas line was ruptured as a contractor was digging it up. Gas seeped into the house and set off a fire in the basement that traveled up a wall, according to fire officials.
 The fire did not cause extensive damage and there were no injuries.
