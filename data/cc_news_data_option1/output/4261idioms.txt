We’re frustrated when a tired or injured fighter purposely spits out his mouthpiece to buy time by forcing the referee to stop the action. We’re annoyed when the ref has to call a time-out because of loose tape on a fighter’s glove.

The 22-year-old Naser was provisionally suspended in June and charged with failing to meet ‘whereabouts’ criteria, but the decision was overturned on Tuesday by World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal. It said the circumstances surrounding one missed test “would have been comical were the consequences not so serious”.
 Naser, who runs for Bahrain, beat Bahamian Miller-Uibo in the 2019 World Championships by running the third fastest time in the history of the event. Miller-Uibo had to settle for her second world championship silver.
 In a post on Instagram, Miller-Uibo demanded to know why Naser had been allowed to run.
 The world championships were in September and October 2019. Between January and April of that year, according to World Athletics, Naser had failed three times to fulfil her whereabouts obligations, although the last of those failures was on Tuesday deemed not her fault by the tribunal.
 “Why was no action taken,” asked Miller-Uibo. “Why was the athlete not provisionally suspended until one year and two months later?”
 “I cry foul play and believe there is a deeper explanation of how World Athletics ... allowed this to carry on.
 “We need to ensure that in athletics, we the athletes are not competing against any administrators whose only goal is for athletes to run faster, jump further and throw further at any cost.”
 Later she added a comment saying she believed that the World Anti-Doping Agency would appeal the tribunal’s verdict to the Court for Arbitration in Sport.

Hamilton star David Templeton is out for at least three months as head coach Brian Rice confirmed a double injury blow.
 The 31-year-old attacker has suffered a serious groin injury and he will be sidelined for a lengthy spell along with 18-year-old Kyle Munro, who is also out for three months with a fractured wrist.
 Both players sustained their injuries in the 5-3 home defeat to St Johnstone last Saturday and missed the 4-2 loss at Aberdeen on Tuesday night, which kept Accies bottom of the Scottish Premiership table.
 After the players underwent scans on their injuries, Rice said: “They are serious. David Templeton and Kyle Munro will probably miss at least three months each, David probably a wee bit more.
 “It is a huge blow, I am not going to lie. David is a special talent and young Kyle, it is his first full season with us.
 “It is a blow for the lads as well but unfortunately the results have come back and it is one of those things.
 “It is the same at every club. When something happens to one player then the opportunity arises for someone else to step up to the plate.
