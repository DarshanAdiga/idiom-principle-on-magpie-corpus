RALEIGH, N.C. (WBTV/AP) - Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Forest has called for all North Carolina K-12 public schools to reopen without requiring students or teachers to wear masks.At a Wednesday morning news conference, the lieutenant governor said he would not mandate masks if elected governor, and that he wants the state to move quickly to Plan A so everyone can have 100% in-person learning.The current directive from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper allows school districts to partially reopen under Plan B, but also gives local school boards the option to stay fully remote under Plan C.Federal health officials have encouraged mask wearing as an effective way to contain the spread of COVID-19.Copyright 2020 WBTV.

ED, CBI, NCB can summon the whole universe, but will still come up with nothing against Rhea as there is indeed nothing. There is no proof of her laundering money. And the minuscule quantity of marijuana found on one of the peddlers is still disputed. SSR was a grown up man who was hooked on to drugs and people cannot come to terms with his sudden death. BJP is using SSR's death & his family as tools for political gain. Rhea hid SSR's drug habits from all & atleast gave him some dignity in death. Until the family came out after 40 days to demand money & somehow convict her. More importantly, his family hid his mental illness & a sister illegally prescribed dangerous medicines during his last days. The investigation & opinion has turned into a lynch fest for Rhea. India loves mob justice. No matter how modern Indians pretend to be, they are worse than the Taliban & are incapable of thinking with common sense & logic. Indians are the biggest herd of sheep in the world currently being diverted from the free-falling economy, rising COVID cases, unemployment , farmers & the migrant crisis to name a few. Vote wisely next time India.

CBI didn't think twice to jump into the FIR filed for SSR family on Rhea. They jumped in way before Supreme court decided to have CBI investigate SSR case. But CBI hesitates to do the same on the FIR filed by Rhea. Why this hesitation on the part of CBI? Why these double standards? It's true they don't have zero political pressure to take up the FIR filed by Rhea or the other way also they must be getting pressure not to entertain the FIR filed by Rhea. May be they will take up Rheas FIR after the Bihar elections are over! It's disgusting how Indian government uses top investigative agencies to do their political dirty work! Innocents like Rhea are mowed like garbage in their dirty games.

Mrs Jaya Bachchan likes to be authoritative with new actors- male or female. Life had treated her well during her prime, since there was no underworld money flooding in to Indian cinema. so, she did not suffer and made enough hay that might last forever for her and her brood. Meanwhile, sheorey and kangana's have to struggle to have footing in the industry mainly because of nopotism, patriarchy and hawala money of goons and thugs AKA mafia hailing from Indian subcontinent are sitting pretty in Dubai and ruling over Bollywood with their money. For the mafia and some old timer actors who are also friends with them, it is truly 'might is right'. So, usually it is either star kids or nobody else is allowed to continue in the India n film industry
