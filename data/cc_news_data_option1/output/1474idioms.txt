Lucas Moura has set his sights on helping Paris Saint-Germain secure a fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title by going the season unbeaten.
 Brazil star Lucas was on the scoresheet on Saturday as PSG opened up a 13-point cushion at the top of Ligue 1 by thrashing Toulouse 5-0 at the Parc des Princes.
 With the title already seemingly a formality, Lucas has revealed the team are hoping to cap another dominant season by making history.
 "We are not champions but if we continue like this, it will make a great championship," he told Canal+.
 "To make history without losing a game, that's our goal. We know it is very difficult but if we continue like this, I'm sure we can get there."
 Lucas replaced Edinson Cavani after the hour on Saturday and scored just three minutes later before driving through the heart of the Toulouse defence and firing a shot that was parried into the path of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to score PSG's fourth.
 The winger has completed just 90 minutes in two games this term, but hopes that more impressive cameos will force his name into the forefront of Laurent Blanc's plans.
 "I'm very happy, first for the victory, and then being able to come on and help the team," he added.
 "It's always difficult to stay out the team and when I return, I have 10, 15 or 20 minutes to do something.
 "That's what I try to do every game where I get on. I am very happy tonight."

Where does one begin when you write the history of Van Metre Field, the iconic home of Du Quoin football? Do you start with the 23-game winning streak from 1986-89, the 28-game winning streak from 1990-97 or two nine-game playoff winning streaks?
 Numbers are fine, but those who have watched the Indians win game after game at the 79-year old stadium on South Street will tell you it’s a story of humans. A story of ordinary people finding it in themselves to do extraordinary things, whether they were wearing shoulder pads, sitting in the bleachers or standing behind the fabled east end zone.
 “It’s like a shrine to me,” said 1984 Du Quoin grad Steve Marek, who now announces the Indians’ games for WDQN Radio. “I played there and I’ve lived just down the street from the high school my whole life. There’s nothing like hosting a playoff game on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.”

I had been in Greensburg twice before in my life and both times were for Frisch's Big Boy.
 As a kid on the west side of Indianapolis, we had a Frisch's Big Boy within 10 minutes of my house. We were there constantly. It was my mom's favorite.
 Her order never changed. Big Boy with extra sauce and a bowl of vegetable soup --- and go ahead and prepare an extra bowl of soup to go.
 When I was around 10 years old, Big Boy closed and the nearest one to us was then --- you guessed it --- Greensburg, Indiana.
 So I start my job on Oct. 19 completely terrified that I have just spent the last four years of my life getting a degree in journalism that I was unfit for and my hope rides on a place I have been to only twice before in my life.
 After the failure in Noblesville, a failure here would send me into a tailspin I may never recover from.
 Day one, reporter Amanda Browning takes me to a meeting of the Greensburg Rotary Club. Where I meet many great members of this city like Jeff Emsweller who I learn was a former newspaper guy himself.
 The main topic of conversation at that meeting was "stamp out polio". Dr. Anxhela Treska spoke and I learned immediately about the good that comes out of a small community like Greensburg.
 This is a strong city and a great county with a lot of hardworking and brilliant people in it.
 Take some time to put away your phones and turn off your television to think of a better time. Think of where you are and how you got there.
 Stay strong and stay healthy everyone.

Laurent Blanc believes Paris Saint-Germain have "a duty" to play Lorient on Saturday as the nation continues to come to terms with the terror attacks that devastated Paris last week.
 The Ligue 1 champions visit the Stade du Moustoir for their first match since the atrocities in the French capital last Friday that killed 129 people.
 There were concerns that some of the squad would be hesitant to return to PSG duties following the international break, but head coach Blanc says not a single player has informed him they do not wish to play, despite admitting they face a "psychological problem".
 "It's not an easy situation," he said on Friday. "It's not just the PSG players who are affected, it's all the players. Foreigners may have been most affected because they were far away from Paris and they saw horrific images of the city on television.
 "We have a job to do, like all coaches. We keep saying that life goes on, but it's easier said than done. I think playing is the best solution. This will be tough for everyone. This is an important psychological problem to solve and it's not simple.
 "Despite all this, despite the images, the shock of being touched by the events... it's easier said than done, but I repeat that life must continue. It is our duty to play football.
 "There is not a player who came to see me to tell me they don't want to play. We have eight matches to prepare for and we have to do our work."
 Both David Luiz and Marco Verratti will be rested for the game due to injury concerns, while Javier Pastore - who lost two friends in the attack on the Bataclan theatre - will not feature as he recovers from a thigh problem.
 "David Luiz is unavailable for the match. We're going to need him in the future so it's a personal decision in relation to the synthetic field and his knee problems," said Blanc.
 "Javier Pastore will be out, he returned to Argentina on Wednesday. He has a recovery programme. The rest of the group is available, except Marco Verratti, who is under treatment."
 Blanc believes Lorient's artificial pitch could pose some problems as the leaders take on a side who have lost just three times in Ligue 1 so far this season.
 "We have to keep our confidence going. The players were back on Thursday with an advanced state of fatigue. It's not easy to prepare for these matches," he added.
 "Our goal is the same, whether we're at home or away. There is an important element to consider: the synthetic pitch that is not ideal for players of an advanced age. I was told that this was the final year. On their own soil, Lorient are a difficult team to beat."

Much of that can probably be attributed to stocking up on booze for several weeks' worth of self-isolation. According to a survey by Alcohol.org, 1 in 5 respondents said they stockpiled alcohol for just that reason. However, many people are also drinking more in general: 1 in 3 respondents said they are likely to increase alcohol consumption in isolation.
 While a few extra drinks to get you through the stress and boredom of being stuck at home might not be a big deal, it can become a slippery slope.

DETROIT (CNN) - Michigan has seen more than 1,700 deaths from COVID-19, most of them in Detroit, where hospitals have been overwhelmed. Photos from one area hospital show bodies piled up and in refrigeration units and stored in vacant rooms, due to the large number of deaths.An emergency room worker at Sinai-Grace Hospital in Detroit shared photos with CNN that show bodies being stored in vacant hospital rooms and piled on top of each other inside refrigerated holding units brought into the hospital’s parking lot.Two other ER workers, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their jobs, confirm the photos are an accurate portrayal of the hospital during one 12-hour shift in early April.Emergency room workers at Sinai-Grace Hospital in Detroit say at least one room, typically used for studies on sleeping habits, was used to store bodies because the morgue was full.At least one room, typically used for studies on sleeping habits, was used to store bodies because morgue staff did not work at night, and the morgue was full.“All I know is we ran out of beds to keep our patients on, so we couldn’t spare any for the bodies,” said one ER worker, who witnessed the bodies in the room.The hospital ordered portable refrigerator storage units to store the bodies in response to the incident, according to two ER workers.A photo obtained from an ER worker shows body bags overlapping each other inside a refrigerated unit at the hospital. Two other ER workers confirm they have seen victims placed like this due to a large number of bodies.Another photo obtained from an ER worker shows body bags overlapping each other inside a refrigerated unit at the hospital. Two other ER workers confirm they have seen victims placed like this due to a large number of bodies."Bodies are definitely double stacked on the floor. There is no lift to help put the bodies on the shelf," said one ER worker who has witnessed similar scenes of bodies.Six ER workers say the hospital was treating about 100 to 130 patients at a time during a period in early April when it was at its highest volume. Over the past several days, that number has dropped to about 50 patients.“Patients who pass away at our hospital are treated with respect and dignity, remaining on-site until they can be appropriately released,” said hospital spokesperson Brian Taylor after a call for comment from CNN. “Like hospitals in New York and elsewhere, we have secured additional resources such as mobile refrigeration units to help temporarily manage the capacity issue caused by COVID-19.”Taylor says the hospital was focused on bringing in additional nursing resources to help care for the increase in cases.Michigan’s governor says the curve is beginning to flatten in parts of the state.Copyright 2020 CNN, Sinai-Grace Hospital worker.

For most of the people, 2020 didn't turn out as it was planned especially with the onset of the worldwide epidemic of Coronavirus or COVID 19. Even since the deadly Coronavirus began in China, it has been declared as a global health emergency. The disease has already infected more than 10 Lakhs people globally. People across the world are taking necessary measures to protect from the same. People have been advised to stay away from infected patients and stay away from crowded places as the virus mainly spreads from respiratory droplets. Like many other things, the outbreak has caused many changes in the entertainment industry as well. Another industry or sector which has been affected drastically in this situation was the event planning industry especially in India the time from October to April is usually a period of back to back weddings throughout the country as it is considered an auspicious period. For Bollywood too, there was just one glamourous wedding this year. It was the wedding of Kareena Kapoor Khan's cousin Armaan Jain with his long time girlfriend, Anissa Malhotra. Armaan’s mother Reema Jain is a sibling of Randhir, Rishi and Rajiv Kapoor. From Kareena Kapoor Khan performing at the sangeet to Ranbir Kapoor attending the wedding with his lady love, Alia Bhatt – the Jain wedding was one big fat event. Given the other couple which made headlines was Tara Sutaria with Armaan's brother Aadar Jain when they danced together at the sangeet and attended several ceremonies together. Previously several other Bollywood weddings made headlines for weeks due to its glamourous ceremonies and of course our dearest A-Listers who attended these ceremonies in style. Actress Anushka Sharma and ace cricketer Virat Kohli were one of the firsts to start off with the trend of an exotic location for their wedding. He further added that it was so confidential that even the guests didn't know where the ceremony was taking place and the location was kept as a top-secret till the very last moment. He said that even both families agreed with them doing a confidential wedding after they saw the receptions that happened in India. They knew that had the wedding ceremony been done with that many guests in India, it would have been madness. The wedding which happened in Tuscany, Italy had only 42 people on the guest list. Post the wedding, brides all over the country started sporting a similar lehenga like Anushka's and even opted for the same song for their walking down the aisle moment as the actress. Similarly, actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas who got hitched with actor-singer Nick Jonas got married in a dreamy affair in Udaipur with the presence of her close friends and family, there were a lot of questions raised about why the diva did not invite anyone from the industry. World Famous Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres asked her a little about her and Jonas's multi-day wedding in India—and specifically about the guest list and why DeGeneres didn't have a spot on it. "Usually Indian weddings are like 1,000 people at least," Chopra said. "We only had 200 people which was mostly just family because both of us have giant families. Because I think we just wanted to keep it super intimate, about just family. For an Indian family and an Indian wedding, for sure, that’s like less. My mother was so upset with me the entire time. She was like, 'I need to have another event for the 150,000 people I know. How can I not invite my jeweler? How can I not invite my hairdresser?" Apart from the amazing ceremonies, their fashionable outfits during the wedding and other Bollywood biggies, what caught our attention was the amazing wedding decor at these ceremonies. Today we have these 10 pictures from Bollywood wedding to inspire the decor of your big day.

While the Supreme Court initially showed no interest in this argument, a version of it became the law of the land in 1992 when the justices decided _Casey._ The Court declined an invitation to reverse _Roe_ and did not adopt the precise version of the undue-burden standard that abortion opponents had developed. Nevertheless, leaders of the anti-abortion movement believed that _Casey_ had identified a way forward. In the short term, abortion opponents could defend restrictions by detailing their benefits (and describing the harms said to result from abortion). And in the long term, contesting the facts could pave the way for the undoing of both _Roe_ and _Casey_.

Social distancing is pretty much impossible for Helal Uddin.
 The Bangladeshi man — whose nickname “Spicy” is a nod to his training as a chef — shares a prison room with 50 other men, one of whom has tuberculosis. The room is full of bunk beds (without mattresses), but Uddin has only a spot on the floor to sleep on. There are over 600 men in the prison, he said.
 “I’m scared,” the 30-year-old Bangladeshi man told BuzzFeed News in a recent telephone interview. “We don’t have any hygiene, we don’t have sanitiser, we don’t have soap, we don’t have anything.”
 Uddin has been a prisoner at Papua New Guinea’s Bomana Correctional Facility, just outside Port Moresby, for the last 11 months.
 But his journey to the facility started years earlier, in 2013, when he boarded a boat to Australia.
 Since then he has experienced a long stint in Australian immigration detention, found love, had a son, been deported from Papua New Guinea, got right back on another boat across the seas to PNG, been arrested and imprisoned again, and converted to Seventh-day Adventism.

To understand the obstinacy of the two leaders, one has to go back and review the events that shaped the 2019 Presidential Election and GR’s victory. True, the yahapalana regime was so unpopular and discredited that GR would have easily crossed the bar. However, with too many candidates on the run and the two ethnic minorities were not supporting GR, opinion makers and political pundits were betting on a result that would depend crucially on preference votes, which could have tilted the odds in favour of SP. It was this fear that made Buddhist supremacists to work overtime, and canvass among the Sinhala voters to convince them of a hidden threat from Muslims. The 2019 April Easter Massacre by Jihadists was a manna from heaven to the hate campaigners. GR won as a result with a clear majority, and became eternally beholden to the agenda of supremacists.

Choosing the burial over the cremation option’ is not an issue to hit at the patriotism of the Muslim community. It is an issue which has been unreasonably created by the authorities in Sri Lanka with no acceptable scientific or medical basis either within Sri Lanka or in a global sense. The denial of the burial option through a gazette notification to such effect, is rather a stubborn and obstinate move of the GoSL to stifle the rights of those who opt for such option( particularly the Muslims). The media release by the Presidential Media division published by Shivanthi Ranasinghe, Director International relations and Foreign media appears to confirm that even the President is in agreement. She also stated that ‘ill effects’ of burying such bodies may even be seen, thousands of years later, (citing some mysterious deaths when opening ancient graves), which is rather humorous to say the least.

While the Supreme Court initially showed no interest in this argument, a version of it became the law of the land in 1992 when the justices decided Casey. The Court declined an invitation to reverse Roe and did not adopt the precise version of the undue-burden standard that abortion opponents had developed. Nevertheless, leaders of the anti-abortion movement believed that Casey had identified a way forward. In the short term, abortion opponents could defend restrictions by detailing their benefits (and describing the harms said to result from abortion). And in the long term, contesting the facts could pave the way for the undoing of both Roe and Casey. After all, Casey had saved abortion rights partly because the Court had concluded that many had profoundly relied on the availability of legal abortion in structuring their lives. Over time, leading anti-abortion groups planned to show that women should not and could not rely on a procedure that harmed them. If this gambit was successful, the foundation for abortion rights would crumble.
