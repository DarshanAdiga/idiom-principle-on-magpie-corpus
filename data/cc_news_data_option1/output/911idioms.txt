Ellen says: "I really identify with some of the young people messaging us. What I would have done to have two girls like Beth and I to look up to."
 She found her diagnosis easy to handle as a child, but as a teenager felt very self-conscious.
 When she started secondary school she hid the fact she took insulin injections by doing them under the canteen table and sometimes did not eat so she didn't have to inject. "That's so dangerous," Ellen says. "I do not recommend that at all."
 Having the support of each other has helped them grow in confidence as they manage the lifelong condition.
 Beth, who was diagnosed last year, says having a supportive and knowledgeable friend in Ellen, and making videos which are popular, has helped her come to terms with the condition.
 "If I didn't have all this hype and glamour around me would I have dealt with it as well?"
 According to Diabetes UK, people with diabetes are twice as likely to experience depression than those without the condition and , after a diagnosis, the focus on food, weight and body image, can trigger eating disorders - something both women are conscious of.
 The duo agree that the feedback has given them a positive outlook, and the success has spurred them on to make more videos.
 They are aware their videos may appear frivolous to some but believe their message on the reality of living with diabetes cuts through the noise on social media because of their frank take on it.

We'd be lying if we didn't say we find it curious and even a bit crazy how the presidential primary system is organized.
   
 Consider these facts. The early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada -- are intentionally smaller states where the candidates can conduct retail politicking. Somehow meeting with average voters, hearing their concerns, traveling to rural communities and, in the case of the latter two states, engaging in more diverse electorates is supposed to allow voters to kick the tires on each candidacy.
   
 And when all of it occurs in the glare of the national spotlight, this process should allow voters of every demographic to take each candidacy for a test drive and decide how comfortable they are with that person attaining the most powerful political position in the world.
   
 But there is a defect in the primary system that needs to be pointed out, and sadly this defect comes from the haphazard process work as designed.
   
 Ideally, the early states in our primary system narrow the field as they ferret out the candidates who might have good ideas but for a variety of reasons should halt their campaigns. The problem is that this year the winnowing happened after millions of people had cast early votes.
   
 Approximately 800,000 people in North Carolina, for example, cast ballots before Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer ended their campaigns. How many people in the 14 states on Super Tuesday wish they'd known those candidates would call it quits before they cast their early ballots?
   
 If one aim of our protracted primary calendar is that we can all get a close look at candidates before they are entrusted with a major party's nomination, why isn't there more time built into the calendar for the early states to winnow the field before Super Tuesday? An extra couple of weeks could have significantly altered this race by giving more voters a look at the field and the ability to cast votes for candidates who are still in the race.
   
 That simple change would strengthen our primary system and would foster a stronger sense of trust among voters who grow cynical about politics.
