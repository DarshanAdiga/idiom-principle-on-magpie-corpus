Kehrer is expected to be part of the regular rotation of defensemen this season and has good on-ice role models in UW's Emberson, Tyler Inamoto and Josh Ess, Granato said.
 There have been unexpected twists since Kehrer last took the ice for a game on Feb. 1. All of it adds to the anticipation for his first game with the Badgers.
 "The last month, in the summer, it's all been skill work and development, speed, all that," Kehrer said. "Now we're actually getting into defensive concepts and more team stuff. Being able to quickly learn that from these coaches and soak it all in before the season starts, these five weeks are pretty crucial for that."

 Jon Lester, Corey Kluber and Brad Hand were among 15 more major leaguers who became free agents Friday when teams declined their 2021 options, many the victims of budget cuts following a regular season without fans due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
 Also cut loose were Milwaukee infielders Jedd Gyorko and Eric Sogard, Chicago White Sox designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion and left-hander Gio Gonzalez, and Philadelphia relievers David Robertson, Hector Neris and David Phelps.
 AL champion Tampa Bay declined 2021 options on right-hander Charlie Morton and catcher Mike Zunino but say it remains hopeful of re-signing them.
 There are 175 players who became free agents following the World Series and about 15 more can go free this weekend. Among the remaining decisions are on player options by Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton, Boston designated hitter JD Martinez, Cincinnati outfielder Nick Castellanos and Mets reliever Dellin Betances.
 Teams must decide by 5 p.m. Sunday whether to make $18.9 million qualifying offers to eligible former players who went free.

“What’s really great is seeing the enthusiasm of the voters,” Kathy Singer, the Cleveland County Election Board assistant secretary, said. “They don’t seem bothered about waiting in line, I know they’d rather be doing something else, but they’re all treating it almost as an event.”
 With everything Cleveland County residents have been through over these past months, they’re excited to get out and vote, Singer said.
 “[We’re going] through COVID and all cooped up and then this ice storm and now it’s like, ‘OK, we get to go out and do something positive, we’re going to go out and vote,’” Singer said. “That’s kind of the attitude I’m seeing from everyone. We’re enjoying it as much as they are.”
 Singer said that the election board wants to remind voters about electioneering and how it is now allowed at the polls.
 “If you’re wearing anything that is in direct support of a candidate on that ballot, then that is electioneering,” she said. “We’re trying to make it a clean line through there, but there isn’t a really clear line. Especially with slogans; sometimes they’re connected to a candidate, but sometimes slogans are not connected to a candidate. It may just be connected to a party view or a group's view — that is not electioneering.”
 For example, anything with the slogans “Black Lives Matter” or “Back The Blue” is not electioneering because it is not referencing a specific candidate; but the slogans such as “Make America Great Again” or “Build Back Better” is electioneering, Singer said. Voters will be asked to remove or cover up anything that is considered electioneering, if they do not comply, they will be asked to leave, she said.
 “Just be kind,” Singer said. “We’re all Oklahomans, and we’re all going to make our voice heard through voting.”
 Voters at the Cleveland County Fairgrounds said not only was the process smooth, but the people in line made it go by faster.
 “The line moved fairly quickly — it took me about an hour-and-a-half total,” Dwayne Moore said. “Probably 95% of people wore their mask, and it went really smooth. You feel good when you’re done [voting].”
 The backbone of the election, poll volunteers put in the work to help people have their voices heard. Norman resident Sarah Toll has been a poll worker since 2005 and said she enjoys doing it.
 “I feel like if I’m doing it, it’s getting done how it’s supposed to be done,” Toll said. “ … [My favorite part] is getting to help and ensuring it’s done right.”
 In addition to veteran poll workers, there are first-timers as well. Mary Womack, a new poll worker, is now semi-retired and decided this would be a great way to give back and do her civic duty.

Exchange officials and advocates say there is no indication people are being put off by the latest challenge to the law before the Supreme Court, with arguments scheduled for a week after the enrollment period begins.
 “The Affordable Care Act has survived many challenges,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Citizens' Health Initiative, which supported a state measure to make it easier to enroll. “It’s working well, and people understand that."
 The court will review the case, Texas v. the United States, to determine whether it remains constitutional without the “individual mandate” that had required all Americans to buy coverage. Republicans in Congress, who object to government involvement in health care or costs, eliminated the penalty under the mandate in 2017, and the justices agreed to review whether any of the law still can stand.
 The law, which provides insurance to more than 20 million Americans, has retained wide support in Maryland, according to Michele Eberle, executive director of Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, which operates the marketplace.
 She noted that when Republicans also cut off a key subsidy to help insurers pay for the costliest beneficiaries, the Maryland General Assembly stepped in with its own program that has lowered rates by more than 30% over the past three years. That offset the cost of premiums that had chased carriers and enrollees from the program.
 UnitedHealthcare returned to the marketplace this year, bringing the number of carriers to three in many counties. CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield and Kaiser Permenente are the other insurers.
 “We know there is great demand,” said Eberle, citing the special enrollment period aimed largely at people who had lost their employer-provided health insurance during the pandemic.
 There are currently 160,000 people enrolled in private plans through the exchange, up 19% from a year ago, and 1.16 million in Medicaid, up 6% from a year ago. People can enroll year-round for Medicaid, but typically must sign up for private plans during a fall open enrollment period for the following year.
 This year, however, the special enrollment period began in March for those who lost jobs during the pandemic and has been extended until mid-December.
 Eberle said a study during the summer affirmed the coronavirus was the driver for many to seek coverage. Nearly 60% said they were more likely to seek insurance now than before the pandemic. For African Americans, disproportionately hit by the virus, 66% were more likely to want the coverage.
 “We know that thousands have lost health coverage after losing jobs during the pandemic,” Eberle said. “Estimates of loss of health coverage in Maryland this year range from 65,000 to 195,000, according to analysis by our agency and other organizations.”
 She also said she believed people were anxious about the continuation of the Affordable Care Act, which provides coverage to the uninsured but also benefits those with employer coverage. The benefits include allowing children to remain on their parents' plans until they are age 26, covering some preventive care and eliminating some coverage caps. The vast majority of people with exchange coverage also receive subsidies to cover premiums.

Renfrew County's Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Robert Cushman says a COVID-19 outbreak at CNL and the ripple effect from a "superspreader" family Thanksgiving dinner should be a wake-up call to people to follow the public health directives.
 As of Friday, Oct. 30, six people at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories in Chalk River have tested positive for COVID-19 but the ripple effect from this outbreak extends to nearly a hundred people.
 News of the family Thanksgiving dinner that became a superspreader of the virus was reported in the media on Oct. 30. In that case, Cushman said, against public health directives about 15 to 20 family members got together for Thanksgiving dinner several week ago. Someone at the dinner had COVID-19 and was either asymptomatic or wasn't paying attention to their symptoms or ignored them and went anyway, resulting in 13 positive COVID-19 cases, 36 people being tested, and 70 to 90 kids missing two weeks of school and being swabbed because of two teens linked to the gathering. Contact tracing has led to another six new contacts who are being booked for testing.
 "It's a real mess," Cushman said.
 In the CNL case, Cushman is quick to point out that the "six positives" stat doesn't tell the whole story as health officials have another 26 other people from CNL isolating at home, all of whom have been referred for COVID testing. Further, an entire building was shut down, with 60 people sent home under instructions to be very cautious, and to self-monitor for symptoms. Because some of these adults have children, Cushman warns there is the potential for two schools to be affected.
 Cushman hopes people will think about the ripple effect of their actions involving other contacts who must isolate while awaiting test results, or are sent home to watch for symptoms resulting in lost family income and students missing weeks at school.
 "My point is this is a wily virus and look at the damage it can do. This is why we have to be so careful. This virus will take advantage when you disregard the public health directives," he said.
 The family gathering at Thanksgiving shows blatant disregard for those recommendations, Cushman said adding that the CNL outbreak is different and interesting because it shows how easily the virus can spread, even in an environment with the extremely stringent health and safety protocols of the nuclear industry. He credited CNL with working with the Renfrew County and District Health Unit from the outset of the pandemic and with working hard to follow the recommendations.
 "So here we have two very different settings and what's concerning is, this is a very wily virus and if you give it an opportunity, even with high standards, if given an opportunity it will seize the day," he said.
 Cushman said public health staff have been "besieged" doing contact tracing from these outbreaks.
 "You can't imagine how much work public health staff is doing. If you think you have COVID fatigue, try being one of these public health workers [who have been working like this every day since this started]," he said.

One of the prime draws of InfoComm is the opportunity to see tomorrow’s technologies today. But how can you tell what’s worth diving into and what’s just a shiny distraction?
 On Tuesday, InfoComm and the IMCCA teamed up give attendees a roadmap of what to pay close attention to at the show, as well as things to look for in the coming year. Emerging Trends Day, new for InfoComm 2017, gathered 10 experts in various fields to offer their insight into the most important developments in their respective areas. After their presentations, they were made available for one-on-one questions in the room across the hall.
 "It’s really a terrific way to kick off InfoComm," says David Danto, IMCCA’s Director of Emerging Technologies. "This your opportunity to network and learn and come up to speed."
 Getting things started in front of a packed room of more than 600 attendees, Peter Putman, technology consultant at Kramer Electronics and President of ROAM Consulting, gave a rundown of the hottest topics from this past CES that figure to influence the direction of technology this year. With a lighthearted zeal, Putman tackled subjects ranging from the falling price and increasing resolution of TVs to developments in autonomous cars and drones, as well as trends in signal transport and networking, such as the potential of 60GHz wireless.
 The full-day program ran from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m., with an hour break for lunch, and included presentations on microphones, displays, digital signage, collaboration, the cloud and managed services--equipping attendees with insight and talking points to scrutinize all facets of the show floor.

Unconfirmed reports indicate that four persons have been killed, while two are in critical conditions following daylight robbery attacks on traders at Alabar, one of the busiest trading areas in the Kumasi metropolis.
 Eyewitnesses said the robbers in a 'Rambo' style, engaged in sporadic shooting in the area and in the process, several people received gunshot wounds, while others got injured in the melee that ensued.
 The robbers, according to the eyewitnesses, succeeded in taking away several thousands of Ghana cedis from the traders, who ran helter-skelter for their lives during the incident.
 The timely interventions of the police reinforcement helped to save the situation.
 The police who managed to arrest three of the suspected criminals after a gun battle have placed them in custody.
 One is said to have received gunshot wounds.
 The Ashanti Regional police Command is yet to comment on the incident, but there is currently heavy armed police presence in the Alabar, Dr. Mensah, parts of Ashtown and the Kumasi central market.
 Alabar is the hub of motorbikes, motorcycles, and second hand clothes sales and is also the epicenter of currency exchange (black market) in Kumasi.
 The area is one of the busiest business districts in the Kumasi metropolis.

In April 2017, at the beginning of the Class Period, Ultra Petroleum exited a court-supervised reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. According to defendants, Ultra Petroleum exited the bankruptcy in "growth mode." Defendants stated that the Company was poised to maximize the value of its substantial oil and gas deposits (which they valued at $4.19 billion, including $1.5 billion of proved undeveloped reserves) through ramped up production in 2017 and 2018 and that Ultra Petroleum was on track to produce between 290 and 300 billion cubic feet equivalent ("Bcfe") in 2017, with 25% production growth over these figures in 2018. Defendants represented that the Company had the financial and production flexibility to weather even a low- commodity-price environment and was set to ramp up well development with 10 rigs operating by 2018 on the back of an estimated $788 million capital budget. Accretive to this plan was the launch of a horizontal well drilling program, which Ultra Petroleum executives claimed was set to significantly expand the production capabilities of the Company's existing wells.
