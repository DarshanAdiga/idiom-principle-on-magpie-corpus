What I did was, I went through and played the songs. The basic criteria for me, it was always lyrics. 'Cause some of these songs — like "You're Sensational," it's tough to have music be relatable when the references are from another generation. Like, when he writes "I don't care / If you're called 'The Fair Miss Frigidaire,' " that's great, but when you're singing to an audience, for two seconds, 90% of the people don't know what you're talking about. That's not what you want. Every single word matters. I tried to pick tunes that had great lyrics for me, and then I looked at the melodies, and these melodies I responded to. So I could have done "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye," or "Night and Day," but I had to pick. And I just picked ones where I said "Oh, I know what I want to do with this."

And our so-called liberals knew all along what sort of false fire they were playing with. Even the _Atlantic_ , one of the most consistent organs of coronavirus propaganda, now concedes that all the hysteria about deadly voting booths was groundless – that, in fact, “voting with a mask on is no more dangerous than going to a grocery store with a mask on – something millions of Americans do every week.” Actually, masks have no provable effect on viral transmission in the first place, so the upshot of the _Atlantic_ ’s admission is that the whole scare campaign about normal voting – like nearly everything else the “experts” have been yelling at us – was a fraud. And it was a fraud that only strengthened the case for an invalidated election, a fact that was staring the Democrats in the face when they started bleating for mail-in voting. Either they were unpardonably stupid, or – as I tend to think – they were getting tired of democracy and were just about ready to pick the next President in a back-room deal with other political rainmakers.

Let me explain the process. First off, I knew that I didn't want anything too gruesome. It's not that I've lost my tolerance for guts and gore as I've gotten older. I can still get down with a _Fangoria_ splatter-fest with the best of them. But I also have seven-year-old twin boys who have a habit of sneaking downstairs in the middle of the night for absolutely no reason. Their tiny little feet are like super-stealth weapons of surprise. They're goddamned ninjas is what they are. Second, like a lot of people, the pandemic has put me in a pretty nostalgic place, where all I seem to crave is comfort food whether it's TV shows, music, or books. My 2020 mantra has been: No heavy lifting. Which is exactly what _The Monster Squad_ delivers. It's got that whole scary- but-not-too-scary Hardy Boys, Little Rascals, suburban kid-sleuth vibe that feels lifted from the pages of the '80s Amblin playbook. And it's simultaneously the rare B-movie that knows it's a B-movie and wears that label like a badge of honor rather than a scarlet letter. So there you go. Done and done.
 Now, if you missed out on _The Monster Squad_ the first time around back in the summer of 1987, you're not alone. The movie tanked. In fact, it barely managed to eke out $3 million at the box office back in 1987, which, when adjusted for inflation, is, I don't know exactly, but it's still pretty bad. The tween-age horror comedy's death was both quick and painless. Unless, of course, you were Shane Black or Fred Dekker--the roommates and recent college grads who cowrote the film (Dekker also directed). For them, it wasn't painless at all--but more about the Black & Dekker team in a bit.

Ninth-graders Shike, Kleparski, Erica Woodard and Bri Ritchie all will toe the start line Saturday at Hickory Point. The first three members of that quartet were involved in the regional display as well.
 They’ve formed a potent synergy with the likes of seniors Taylor Joop, Elizabeth Hulick and Caroline Bachert and junior Malia Fairbanks, which is especially important this week. On Tuesday, Unity entered a two-week remote learning period because of positive COVID-19 tests at the high school, causing the Rockets to forgo multiple team practices leading up to the sectional.
 “They all have a desire to win,” Leaman said. “From the word go they have been ready to come and train hard. ... They all know what it takes to step up to the next level.”
 That was evident at the 2019 IESA 2A state meet, in which Unity Junior High eased to the top team spot by scoring 50 points to runner-up Chicago Latin’s 130. Woodard (third place), Shike (14th), Kleparski (16th) and Ritchie (33rd) finished within the team’s top six at that particular race.
 Woodard and Ritchie also ran at the Rockets’ 2018 IESA state appearance, which ended with a team victory. And all of these girls were sixth-graders when that outfit produced yet another first-place performance.
 “It’s nice to get to help the team out,” Kleparski said. “I didn’t really think I would be racing varsity my first year. But I guess it happens and I did. We all did.”
 Woodard not only is part of the Rockets’ varsity lineup, but she’s regularly been its No. 1 finisher. The latest example was at the regional, in which Woodard took fourth with a time of 18 minutes, 21 seconds. Only five of the regional’s 89 athletes crossed the finish line in faster than 19 minutes, and Woodard was the only Unity participant to do so.
 “It’s very strange because I’ve never really been the number one runner. So this whole season was like, ‘Woah, I’m first? What?’” Woodard said. “It took a lot of getting used to, to be ahead of the pack and not in the pack. Very stressful.”

As the clouds parted, the Blues only got brighter and they took a thoroughly deserved lead in with them at half-time.
 Guardiola will have had two very good reasons to try to make sure his players did not let up though.
 The manager was dazzled by Sheffield United last season, declaring them as the one team in the league he has learned something from. That opinion has not waned on the back of a poor start to the season from the Blades; Guardiola held up their lowly position in the table as a sign of how unpredictable the league is.
 He is also well aware of how his team have faded in games. Where they are used to finishing so strongly, this season has seen them score just one second-half goal - in the opener against Wolves - and concede six. That is partly why the coach continues to fume about the decision in the division to revert back to three substitutes as his jaded players struggle to last the distance.
 Many would say Guardiola doesn't help his argument by refusing to rest players. There were just three changes from the team that won against Marseille, and the manager had only actually used his full complement of substitutions in two of five league games coming into this match.

It began just seven years ago, with the emergence of the movement amid its organizers' outrage over the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the Florida man who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
 A year later, BLM marched onto the global stage after an uprising in the wake of Michael Brown's death at the hands of a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
 The three women who founded BLM were already activist powerhouses. Cullors had established her own social justice organization in Los Angeles, Power and Dignity Now. Opal Tometi had been executive director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, advocating for social and economic prosperity of Black immigrants to the U.S. Alicia Garza, had been a special projects director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance, fighting for the rights of professional nannies and other caregivers.
 They saw the need to make BLM more than a slogan, Garza said.
 "We were getting people who were wanting to start chapters, and they were from all over the place," she said. "We would be asking them, 'Well, what else do you have in your community?' And they would say, 'Nothing.' We were in the middle of a literal storm and needing to fly a plane as you're building it."
 BLM formed a network of chapters in 2015, building infrastructure and an organization that drew funding from celebrities like Beyonce, Jay-Z and Prince.
 Its first-ever Los Angeles chapter came to the aid of Helen Jones. She believes her 22-year-old son, John Thomas Horton III, was murdered in 2009 through neglect of sheriff's deputies who stuck him in a closet-sized, windowless cell and left him in solitary confinement for weeks. Though officials determined that Horton hanged himself, Jones said injuries on his body suggest that he was brutally beaten.
 She needed a champion to keep her son's case in the spotlight. Enter Black Lives Matter. She worked with local movement organizers and other victims' families to demand stronger civilian oversight of the county jails via a 2020 ballot initiative. Voters approved the measure in March, granting a sheriff oversight commission subpoena powers to investigate civilian complaints.
 BLM's profile increased quickly. In 2017, the founders were awarded the Sydney Peace Prize.
 In 2018, Cullors appeared on stage at the Academy Awards ceremony with prominent voices in the #MeToo and transgender rights movements. Across social media platforms, the Black Lives Matter movement boasts a following of millions.
 "I think over the past seven or eight years, so many people within Black Lives Matter have been asking what started out as questions that were only ever asked in academia -- questions like, 'What can we do about police brutality?' and 'What to do when we feel we can't call the police,'" said Janaya Khan, the network's international ambassador and co-founder of its Canadian branch.
 "So now in this time of pandemic, when so many people are experiencing a kind of precarity, one that so many Black people already know intimately, there are questions that they're asking and we have some answers that we can offer," Khan said.
 Since the wave of protests sparked by George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police in May, BLM has undergone a somewhat quiet transformation. As the words "Black lives matter" began appearing in city-sanctioned street murals coast to coast, the BLM network banked millions of dollars from a surge of donations -- so much that Cullors established a grant fund of more than $12 million.
 While Garza and Tometi stepped away from day-to-day stewardship of BLM years ago, Cullors remains executive director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. Its existing chapters, including those in Los Angeles, Chicago and Detroit, are now autonomous entities that are eligible to receive funding from the network, Cullors said.
 Broad visibility and influence have come at a high personal cost for prominent BLM voices. "Black Lives Matter," as a slogan, elicited "All Lives Matter" and "Blue Lives Matter" responses from foes. It also meant Cullors, Garza, Tometi and many others associated with the BLM movement have faced threats, as well as surveillance by local and federal law enforcement, Cullors said.
 Days before the election, Cullors released a video announcing she and Garza had been contacted by the FBI after their names were found on a list of activists a white supremacist allegedly intended to harm.
 "No threats against me or my movement will stop this revolution," Cullors said in the video. "And we will be here. We will show up to the polls and we will organize."

 BLM has launched a political action committee to support candidates, campaigns and legislation. And as the voting wraps up, the organization is hosting pandemic-safe drive-in rallies, text-banking voters and leveraging its millions to run ads focused on increasing the Black vote.
 One aim is to press sweeping federal legislation known as the BREATHE Act, a bill drafted by the policy table of the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition formed in 2014 that now includes more than 150 affiliate organizations that make up the broad Black liberation struggle.
 The act, not yet introduced in Congress, would divest federal resources from incarceration and policing, including the elimination of a Department of Defense program that allows local law enforcement agencies to obtain excess military equipment -- equipment that has been used against BLM protests.
 At the state and local level, the Working Families Party, a coalition member, said it expects a stellar Election Day performance from its slate of progressive district attorney candidates in Texas, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan, Colorado and Florida. The candidates, some of them incumbents, have pledged to take up or continue policies such as declining to prosecute low- level drug offenses, not seeking cash bail, and holding police accountable for brutality.
 There is some concern that the results of the presidential election might be misinterpreted as either an endorsement or a rejection of BLM.
 "I do worry that people will see a Biden victory and say that it shows Black Lives Matter was supported," said Justin Hansford, a Ferguson protester and law professor who now serves as director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center at Howard University. "That's sort of like the most twisted thing you can think, because he has adamantly stated that he will increase police budgets."
 Biden has supported providing more funding to law enforcement so that they can hire and train officers to better deal with calls involving emotionally distressed or mentally ill citizens. Trump has threatened to pull federal funding from cities that vote to decrease police department funding.
 "If there's going to be any sort of success for Black Lives Matter on a political platform," Hansford said, "it's going to be traction at the local level, in cities and states across the country."

Mumbai Indians ensured a top-two finish in the IPL league table with a clinical nine-wicket decimation of an already battered Delhi Capitals, who wilted under relentless pressure from Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah.
 While Boult (3/21 in 4 overs) dealt telling opening blows, Jasprit Bumrah (3/17 in 4 overs) broke the backbone of the Delhi Capitals middle-order, choking them to 110 for 9.
 The defending champions coasted to victory in 14.2 overs, taking their points tally to 18 and will have two shots in the play-offs to get into the final.
 Delhi Capitals, who had won seven out of their first nine games, have now lost four on the bounce and with a match left are in danger of missing out on the play-offs with an ever-deteriorating net-run-rate of minus 0.159.
 While batting, Delhi Capitals consumed 62 dot balls, which effectively meant that more than half of their stipulated 20 overs had gone without scoring.
 A target of 111 can’t be defended nine out of 10 times and the pocket dynamo Ishan Kishan scored 72 not out off 43 balls to make the chase look like a walk in the park.
 Not for once did Delhi Capitals looked like being in control as they made the Dubai strip and the MI bowling attack look doubly menacing with some of the best batsmen abdicating their responsibilities of playing fearless cricket.
 Boult was brilliant upfront removing openers Shikhar Dhawan (0) and Prithvi Shaw (10 off 11 balls) in the powerplay which pegged the Delhi Capitals back.
 Captain Shreyas Iyer (25 off 29 balls) and Rishabh Pant (21 off 24 balls) then compounded their team’s worries as they failed to regain the lost momentum.
 The duo, for the umpteenth time, looked like playing for themselves and the intent was missing which affected the morale of the batsmen coming down the order.
 Quinton de Kock effected a great stumping off Rahul Chahar to see Iyer’s return to the hut after which came Bumrah’s devastating two-over spell.
 A ball pitched on length was climbing up while moving a shade away which Marcus Stoinis edged to the wicketkeeper.
 Pant’s misery ended when Bumrah came round the wicket and fired one from wide off the crease that came in with the angle to trap him leg before.
 He then tormented Harshal Patel, who played and missed a few before being adjudged leg-before, a decision that couldn’t be reviewed as Pant had consumed it during his dismissal.
 If Delhi Capitals miss out on a playoff berth, Iyer-Pant duo will have to accept their responsibility as premier international players in this DC line- up.
 Iyer has scored 414 runs in 13 games but mostly coming in at No 3, his strike- rate of less than 125 has left a lot to be desired.
 Pant has been even worse and with each passing match, his wretched form is perhaps a vindication of Sunil Joshi-led national selection committee’s decision to drop him from the white-ball squads for the Australia tour.
 In 10 games, he has scored only 274 runs at a below-par strike rate of 112.29 and more importantly failed to score a 50 even when he batted at No. 4 in most of the games.

Dekker was one of the first to hit pay dirt. A horror comedy script he'd written was turned into 1985's _House_ , and he would write and direct 1986's _Night of the Creeps_. Black, on the other hand, was starting to give up hope. He'd convinced his parents to bankroll him for a year to see if he could make a go of it as a professional screenwriter. And time was almost up. The first script he'd written was called _Shadow Company_ , about a bunch of MIA Vietnam soldiers whose bodies are returned home where they unleash hell as zombies. John Carpenter actually optioned it, but then nothing happened. Then he began writing an action-comedy about a pair of odd-couple L.A. cops. Halfway through, he threw it in the trash. Two days later, he dug it back out and finished it. The script was called _Lethal Weapon_. Dekker helped his pal find an agent, who sold the script to Warner Bros. for $250,000. Black was 22.

 He said Thayambaka, one of the finest and popular percussion art forms, could be enjoyed by all sections of people if given in a capsule form. According to him, it can attract not only tourists but also anyone who does not have the patience and time to sit through a one-and-half hour performance.

They can play the grind it out, physical, ball control game, or they can light it up. So obviously a great challenge. I think they’re an excellent football team." — Head Coach Dan Mullen

They've kind of won two games two different ways, meaning they're kind of ground and pound against Kentucky and really kept the ball from Kentucky's offense.

 Joe had many unorthodox and good ideas. Concerning elections, Joe proposed that instead of voting for clamoring, ambitious, self-serving "wannabes," we should instead draft ordinary citizens, like in the old draft lottery, and assign them to political seats. I see great wisdom in this notion.
 My second friend, Archie, had served in the Vietnam War era. He was, like Joe, a philosopher, of course. He told me that there's two ways to determine if a politician is lying: 1. If his mouth is open. 2. If his lips are moving.

History has a funny way of repeating itself.
 It's a scenario Canada found itself in during the early 1970s. Liberal prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau was in charge at the time when his U.S. counterpart, president Richard Nixon, turned his country inward to protect domestic industries during the last stretch of the Vietnam War.
 Nixon's administration slapped protectionist tariffs on Canadian imports with no advanced notice, which strained the "special relationship" the two countries had enjoyed for decades. It also further curdled relations between the countries' two leaders. The U.S. president dubbed the prime minister a "pompous egghead" and called him a "son of a bitch" behind closed doors. "I've been called worse things by better people" was Trudeau's famous retort to the president's insults.
 Now his son, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has found himself in a similar position.

The assumption for Santee’s future going forward is that HomeFed members, now forced to halt the bulldozers, will have to sit on their hands until November of 2022, which is when the Fanita Ranch referendum is expected to be on the ballot, although the developer could pay for a special election to move up citizen decision-making. In either event, Santee citizens will vote on whether they choose to build the project. Unfortunately for HomeFed, no matter when the citizens vote, it is appears unlikely most Santee residents will reverse their stance against the development project.

In tandem with the figure of an Irish boy positioned sanguinely at the front of the boat as a symbol of innocence and optimism, the bread-and-fruit motif encapsulates how food is interlocked with the history of human migration. It recalls the extreme scarcity that refugees have had to endure, while simultaneously serving as a piercing reminder that it is the very victims of famine, disease, war and heartbreak — people whom the pope called "the poorest of the poor" — who have immeasurably enriched global foodways by carrying their produce, seeds, farming techniques and culinary skills with them to their new homes.

What's most interesting about _The Monster Squad_ is how this little things- that-go-bump-in-the-night story about a group of middle-school pals out to stop a menagerie of infamous bogeymen (Dracula, the Mummy, the Wolfman, Frankenstein's Monster, and _The Creature from the Black Lagoon_ 's Gill-Man) has been resurrected and embraced in recent years. It's gone from being a dead-and-buried Reagan-era relic to a genuine beloved cult classic. So much so that a few years back, Michael Bay's production company flirted with a remake before eventually pulling the ripcord. There's even a 2018 documentary about the film's rabid fanbase called _Wolfman 's Got Nards_, directed by _The Monster 's Squad_'s now-grown kid star, Andre Gower.
 To be clear, _The Monster Squad_ isn't any scarier than your average Harry Potter film. But it's certainly a lot more charming due to its rough edges. Plus, if you're a devotee of Universal's classic black-and-white monster movies of the '30s, '40s, and '50s, it's an affectionate, _Van Helsing Lite_ tip of the hat to those gems. Granted, Duncan Regehr's Dracula in the film is no Bela Lugosi (and he's certainly no Christopher Lee--the greatest of all movie Draculas by a mile). But thanks to Stan Winston's make-up handywork, it's a bit like watching, if you'll pardon the expression, the dead coming back to life. Meanwhile, the movie's cast of pint-sized vampire slayers actually seem like real kids. They're not precocious or hammy and there isn't a Corey (Feldman or Haim) in the bunch. They feel like real kids who just happen to fashion stakes in woodshop and melt down their parents' cutlery to make silver bullets so they can literally face down their demons. How _The Goonies_ or _The Lost Boys_ was a hit and this thing wound up in the Blockbuster remainder bin back in the '80s is a mystery to me.

The Railway Protection Force (RPF) on Saturday launched an initiative for shoring up security for women rail passengers in the Mysuru Division.
 Called “Meri Saheli’’, the initiative will provide safety and security to women passengers travelling by trains for their entire journey, from the station of origin to their respective destinations.
 The initiative entails interaction with women passengers – especially those travelling alone – by the RPF women personnel at the originating station. The authorities said the passengers will be briefed about the precautions to be taken during the journey and are advised to dial 182 in case of any problem in the coach.
 The RPF team collects the seat numbers of the women passengers and conveys them to RPF personnel at stations en route. The RPF staff on duty at the platforms will also keep an unobtrusive watch over the coaches and berths and interact with the women passengers if need arises, railway authorities said.
 The RPF escorts on board will also cover the coaches or the identified berth during the course of the journey.
 RPF teams at the destination will collect the feedback from the identified women passengers and their response will be analysed for corrective actions if required. In the event a distress call originates from a train covered under Meri Saheli initiative the response will be monitored by senior officers, the authorities added.

Summit added eight more points when Purry rushed for a 15-yard touchdown and then hauled in a pass from Coy on the 2-point conversion.
 Determined to score, Rams quarterback Aaron Salazar found wide receiver Devin Dustman open for a touchdown. The 2-point attempt was intercepted by the Dragons’ Jeremiah Dallas-Martin.
 Purry went on to return the kickoff 60 yards for a touchdown and Summit led 36-6, following a failed 2-point try.
 Just before the half, Dallas-Martin picked off a pass near his own 40-yd line. He ran it all the way back for a touchdown and the Dragons took a 42-6 lead into the break.
 In the second half, Khalil Johnson took over at quarterback for Summit and scored on a short run, with Purry getting in on the 2-point conversion. The touchdown was set up by a 27-yard run from Jones, who crossed the goal line in the fourth quarter to cap off the scoring.
 “They were good,” said Rams coach Brandon Reaume. “It comes down to blocking, tackling and making plays. They did all three of those things better. It’s a tough way to go out but that’s a talented team. They have some guys for sure.”
 Next up for Summit will be a home game against Robichaud, which dominated Whitmore Lake 50-24 on Friday night.

 The core net interest income (NII) moved up 16% to ₹9,366 crore despite a 0.10% contraction in the net interest margin (NIM) to 3.57% and credit growth being nearly half that of deposit growth at 6%.
 Its president Sandeep Batra attributed the high profit growth to NII, and credited the strategy of risk calibrated growth followed by the bank under new leadership over the last two years for delivering higher income.
 NIM was lower because of the excess liquidity in the system, as the bank was not able to deploy the higher deposits it got for loans, the management said, making it clear that it will now be more open to lending across segments as the economic activity normalises, but follow the same strategy.
 Its overall provisions came at ₹2,995 crore as against the ₹2,506 crore in the year-ago period and the elevated ₹7,593 crore in the preceding quarter.
 Mr. Batra said after setting aside over ₹8,700 crore, done majorly in the March and June quarters, for the possible impact of COVID-19, the bank now feels that the provisions made are sufficient to absorb the impact of the pandemic on asset quality.
 He added that the bank has not utilized any of the excess provisions made for the pandemic. The overall tax expenses reduced by over two-thirds to ₹1,014 crore, which helped the bottom line.
 The bank has received a few applications for restructuring from borrowers across segments, he said, adding that it is still early days as the window is open till December 31.
 It said over ₹1,400 crore of loans could have slipped into non performing advances (NPAs) during the quarter, but for the Supreme Court mandate not to classify accounts up to August 31 as NPAs. However, the bank has made an extra provision of ₹497 crore on such advances.
 The overall slippages came at ₹3,017 crore during the quarter with retail loans accounting for ₹1,700 crore. However, the bank management said the reverses are within the risk appetite and the lender is comfortable with its retail portfolio as well.
 The quantum of low-rated advances, which are at the highest risk of slipping into NPA, came down by ₹1,000 crore to ₹16,000 crore during the quarter on upgrades and slippages from the book, Mr. Batra said.
 The retail loans grew 6% and corporate advances grew 7% during the quarter while there was a sharp 32% decline in the overseas loan book. Unlike some of its peers, it is not observing stress in the unsecured assets book as much of its borrowers are salaried ones.
 Mr. Batra said the overseas book, which used to be at over 12% of the overall loans two years ago, now accounts for 6.5% of the overall advances and will continue to decline as the bank focuses on domestic opportunities.
 The bank is not tracking credit growth as a metric for growth but is rather focusing on the risk-calibrated approach, he said, adding that the objective is to provide consistent and predictable returns to shareholders.
 It expects a normalisation in credit costs from the next fiscal onwards, wherein the money set aside for reverses in asset quality will be at 25% of the operating profit.
 The bank’s overall capital adequacy increased to 18.47% on the back of a recent fund infusion and the management said it is not looking at any inorganic opportunities of growth.
 The bank scrip had closed 1.84% down at ₹392.55 on the BSE on October 30, as against a 0.34% correction on the benchmark.

If you don't want to completely stop making your mortgage payments -- say, you can partially afford them -- you might instead ask your lender to modify your loan's repayment terms. You can also try refinancing to a lower mortgage rate to see if that reduces your monthly payments enough to make them manageable. Avoiding forbearance means you won't get stuck in payment catch-up mode once that period ends, so it pays to explore alternatives. That said, you are allowed to pay your mortgage while your loan is in forbearance, so if you can swing partial payments, that's an option too.

 Members of the Indian National Congress (INC), who attempted to observe a token fast near the Tallakulam head post office, were arrested by the police, here on Saturday.
 The DCC president Karthikeyan told reporters that as part of the Statewide agitation by the Congress, it was proposed to hold agitations against the BJP- led government.
 The objective of the agitation was to condemn the Farmers Act which would ruin the agricultural sector in the country over a period of time. The Centre, he alleged, was keen to help a few friends of the BJP leaders in corporate houses. Keeping this in mind, they passed the Act in a hurry in the Parliament without even a discussion.
 When AICC former president Rahul Gandhi had warned of the consequences, when it was tabled in the Parliament, the BJP MPs led by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi neglected them. Citing the Punjab government, he said, the Congress-ruled State had passed an Act in the Assembly which would protect the farmers.
 Like Punjab, other non-BJP governments in the country would follow suit and save the agrarian sector, Mr. Karthikeyan said and courted arrest along with the cadre.
 Police said that all the arrested people were released later in the evening. The members claimed that they observed the fast during the detention by the police in a private marriage hall.

CUZCO, Peru (AP) — Efraín Valles guided world leaders, pop stars and a princess on exclusive tours through the land of the Incas. He now makes ice cream to survive amid the coronavirus pandemic. Valles, once one of the most sought-after tour guides in Cuzco high in Peru's Andes, is one of the 1.3 million people nationwide in a tourism industry devastated by the novel coronavirus and the measures imposed to fight its spread, including international travel restrictions. Cuzco, the historic capital of the Inca empire near Machu Picchu lives almost entirely from international tourism and is suffering the worst crisis in its recent history. More than 226,000 people who make crafts or work as waiters, hotel staff and taxi drivers, have been plunged into an economic abyss. Merchants say they have lost more than two- thirds of their income. “We are starting from scratch in an activity that we never thought we were going to do,” said Valles, who together with two of his colleagues have started making artisanal fruit ice creams they sell under the name of “Qosqo Creme.\" The last decade was brilliant for Valles. In 2014, he was called the best guide in the world by British tourism magazine Wanderlust and in 2016 the government made him an ambassador for a marketing strategy to draw more international tourists He gave tours to Princess Beatrice, granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II, the former president of the World Bank Jim Yong Kim, British singer Ed Sheeran, as well as the grandchildren of U.S. explorer Hiram Bingham, who photographed Machu Picchu in 1911.

Only Spanish and Quechua can be heard in Cuzco's main square, something unimaginable...
