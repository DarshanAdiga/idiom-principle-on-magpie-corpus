Up against the indefatigable (or so he tells me when he played, if he played) Mark Scully, mein host at the Ale House, so I’ll start with a win. The Sharks (12-) take on the Eels at the Sandpit and, with four Landers (yes four) in their ranks, might just get it done. The Hawks (12-) are at home to Southern at the Crayfish Pot — the Geese didn’t win and neither will the Magpies! Varsity (12-) is pretty small by all accounts and the Onion is a big unit so an upset is on the cards but Varsity just. In the grudge match from hell on the High Veldt Super Club (12-) just beats the Spannerheads. Look out for a fracas in the club afterwards with the Godfather involved.

June 29 – The Fourth of July on a Saturday and a Full Moon makes this one a special one. We may miss getting to share it with our friends and families as we celebrate in different places together. Yes, there will be lots of gatherings, but many older, vulnerable folks will picnic alone with their bar- b-que, watermelon and apple pie, thinking about the current State of the Nation and the good changes they hope will come. The necessary cancellation of the Old Tree Huggers Jamboree will thwart and stymie the myriad enlightened conversations that would have been had over the past, present and future. Those discussions are still going on if only around the kitchen table with the old man or with friends on the phone. Some people just talk to hear their head rattle, but ever so once in a while, something rings true. Whatever that is that rings true for you, it generally conforms to whatever you already believe. There is hardly any point in trying to convince folks who believe differently that you are right and they are wrong. We better just look at each other and grin, maybe shake our heads and leave unspoken our wonder and amazement that people we like and care about can be so obtuse. Harmonize with them if you can “…and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea!”

Poor Rick Stoner (who, Coulson jokingly notes, should probably have a more fun personality given his name).

Stoner loves all their fancy technology (such as the tracking device that allows '70s S.H.I.E.L.D. to pursue the high-tech Zephyr) but doesn't think about where it comes from or what it might cost. When missiles are fired at the Zephyr, he starts to suspect he's not in control anymore, but it's not fully confirmed until the Chronicoms try strapping him down to their brain-drain machine. He's saved in the nick of time by Coulson and May, whose new empathy superpower allowed her to detect that Stoner's right-hand woman had already been Chronified (since they don't have emotions).

In terms of dressing the hurley I’ve improved compared to years ago — I gave Ray Dowling my first hurley to copy once and there was almost an entire roll of surgical tape around the top of it. I like a white grip — Patrick Horgan claims he started the white grips, but I think I did.


  I always went for two braces — I never liked one brace on the hurley, so it’s either two braces or one. People will probably think I’m over the top, but everyone has different needs with their hurley.


  Don’t forget, for instance, an outfield player wouldn’t have time to think about his hurley while a goalkeeper mightn’t touch the ball for two minutes. So he’s just standing there with his hurley in his hands — it has to feel right or else he’s distracted.


  Would I have many hurleys around the house? I counted forty-something in my shed at home one day, and then I headed out to my mother’s house and there were another 20 or 30 there.


  Looking at players with outstanding skills, it has to be Patrick Horgan. His hands are unbelievable. Making the ball talk isn’t an exaggeration.


  I see what he can do at training, obviously, but it’s more than that.


  If I’m training with Cork and I’m not happy with a particular shot or touch, I’d often ask him to stay on after the session ends to put ten balls in a particular place to remedy that.


  Say I left in a shot over my right shoulder during the session — I’d say to him, ‘can you put ten shots just over my right shoulder’ to work on that. Nine out of ten shots that he’d take — or more — would go exactly where I ask him.

We strongly urge you to rescind a 2017 U.S. Department of Justice (“the Department” or “DOJ”) memorandum in which former Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered DOJ to take the position that transgender workers are not protected from workplace discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. At the time it was issued, the Sessions memorandum not only reversed a position that Department attorneys had argued in court, but also contradicted the view of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the decisions reached by five federal appeals courts.  However, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent landmark decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga., which held that “[a]n employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law,” the Sessions memorandum is now at odds with controlling Supreme Court precedent. The Department’s current position therefore misstates the law, poses an ongoing threat to the well-being of transgender workers, and invites liability for employers that misguidedly rely upon it. The Supreme Court’s Bostock decision compels DOJ to rescind the Sessions memorandum and we urge you to abandon it immediately.

The construction of this fencing with no notice and no collaboration to understand how it could best integrate with market operations truly shows a complete lack of regard for producers dependent on the market for their livelihood, of which there are several (myself included).


  The citizens of Franklin County should be proud of the wide array of products being produced here -- from grass fed beef, pastured chicken, organic vegetables, artisanal grains and cheeses and a long list of others, we still possess a wide array of small farms who are proud to do things the right way and put food on your table.

“When the governor said shut down, we shut down. When the governor said we could reopen, we reopened,” he said. They are following all the guidelines, sanitizing pews, sitting far apart and requiring face coverings.


  “If you come in without a mask, we have a mask for you. If you decide you don’t want to wear a mask, we ask you to go away, and I’ll come visit you later to protect the health of others,” he said.


  Bell said too few people in Franklin County are observing the mandate to wear face coverings in public places. She estimates only half do.


  “I’m trying to explain to people if we all just do the right thing now, we won’t have this to deal with this in another wave. I fear that’s already too late,” she said.


  On Wednesday, Virginia enters Phase 3 of reopening, which allows more entertainment businesses to open and stores and restaurants to operate at full capacity for up to 250 people to gather.


  Gov. Ralph Northam, in lifting the restrictions, said Virginia’s numbers look good. Daily case counts and hospital admissions are falling.


  Virginia’s epidemiological curve is similar to the shape of the state, rising from the west to an apex between West Virginia-Maryland and then dropping toward the shore. Northern, northwestern and central Virginia follow that same familiar pattern. Eastern Virginia looks more like a plateau.


  Southwest Virginia begins like its western border, steadily rising during the spring until mid-June, when the trend line appears as though it is racing up a mountain without the peak in sight.


  “Our curve has gotten steeper. It was steadily going up, and now our curve is steep,” said Dr. Molly O’Dell, who is leading the pandemic response for the Roanoke and Alleghany Health Districts.


  Many cases are linked to Myrtle Beach, but not all. O’Dell said many of them are coming from younger people called back to the workforce as restaurants and businesses reopen. Until recently, the districts had hardly seen cases in people under the age of 40. Now, the majority are in that age group, she said.


  Hospitalizations had numbered fewer than 10 a day through most of the pandemic. Last week, inpatients climbed to 21 and were at 22 on Tuesday when O’Dell held her weekly press briefing.


  With Phase 3, she said, “our cases will continue to go up. The more opportunity we have for commingling, the more opportunity there is for disease transmission.”


  Roanoke had accumulated 343 cases until a week ago. O’Dell said the city now has had 489 cases. The state’s website shows 50 fewer, but there is often a lag between what O’Dell reports and what the system logs.


  So far, she said contact investigators and tracers have been able to keep up.


  “If we had more case investigations than we could keep up with in a day, I would have to let my city and county leaders know that,” she said.


  She said it was predictable that this region’s surge would come after the more urban areas. University of Virginia models have shown that throughout the pandemic.


  And, she said, “the rate of increase of our cases is perfectly predictable given the amount of opening we have already had.”


  She said local government leaders are in touch with her and there isn’t a plan to add restrictions.


  “The catch, the difficult thing for all of us, is it would be easy if we just said it has to be either health or social and economic viability. But as you know, we just can’t do that. It has to be both, and not either-or,” she said. “It’s a complicated process trying to assess what’s best for both.”

It's hard to blame Mack for taking a motorcycle ride shortly after they land, to get some air. Deke follows, since he knows what it's like to lose his parents.

David Clark's departure, which also followed criticism for his personal breaches of strict lockdown rules earlier in the year, comes as New Zealand heads into a September general election.


  "It has become increasingly clear to me that my continuation in the role is distracting from the government's overall response to COVID-19 and the global pandemic," Clark, who was criticised for taking his family on a beach trip and driving to a mountain biking track, said.


  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who had earlier refused calls to sack Clark, citing his critical role in the country's response to the pandemic, said she agreed with his decision.


  Three years after becoming the world's youngest female leader, Ardern remains popular, lauded for her compassionate response to last year's Christchurch shooting and swift handling of the coronavirus crisis.


  But blunders by her ministers have drawn claims from the opposition there is a lack of talent in her cabinet, a potentially damaging charge ahead of the September election.


  Ardern's popularity skyrocketed early in the pandemic as she took decisive action limits its spread, imposing one of the world's toughest lockdowns. But opinion polls released last week show the conservative National Party has managed to trim some of Labour's lead.


  "She has no confidence in anyone else not to drop the ball," National Party leader Todd Muller said.


  Grant Duncan, an associate professor of politics at Auckland's Massey University said the opposition had been granted an opportunity to "talk of the government's failure to deliver and incompetence." Clark's resignation would help dampen that rhetoric, he added.


  Ardern declared in early June that New Zealand had eliminated coronavirus, although she warned there would almost certainly be new cases, as she lifted social distancing restrictions.


  Just days later it was revealed that two women who arrived from Britain who were allowed to leave quarantine early on compassionate grounds later tested positive for the virus.


  The country still has no known cases of community transmission, but there are 18 active cases at the border through returning New Zealanders.


  Ardern appointed Education Minister Chris Hipkins as interim health minister until the September election. It is the second time in 18 months Arden has reshuffled her cabinet, replacing her housing minister last year after he came under fire for the failure of the government's flagship public housing project.

After falling to sixth-seeded perennial power Duxbury, 8-7, in the 2019 Division 1 South semifinals, the Franklin High boys lacrosse team was ready to come back even stronger in 2020.


  Returning with one of the top attack units in the state according to head coach Lou Verrochi, this lined up to be a promising spring for the Panthers. Even a state title wasn't out of the question.


  "I thought we were going to have a pretty decent run in the tournament," Verrochi said. "It was (looking like) a very promising year to say the least."


  The coronavirus pandemic had other plans, however, ending what could have been a banner year before it even began.


  "To say the least, it was devastating," Verocchi said. "Especially for the kids. I think they really had some thoughts on being able to vie for a state championship, and I did as well."


  Two of those kids, senior captains Jake Davis and Ben Greco, were part of that aforementioned attack unit.


  "We wanted nothing short of a state championship coming off of the program's best season as a team," Greco said. "I feel like this year could have been our year to win that state championship."


  As the coronavirus pandemic continued to rage on and spread like wildfire, Verocchi knew that the season was probably in jeopardy.


  "When they started talking about how the pandemic was spreading, I automatically knew that we were probably going to cancel the season and that the kids were going to be let go from school," he said.


  Still the players tried to hold out hope.


  "It was obviously a shock, but at the same time it was something that we had talked about it being possible," said Davis on the season getting canceled. "We were trying to stay optimistic about the season but once the announcement was made, it was still a big blow because now there is no chance of us playing."


  Davis and Greco make up two-thirds of that attack line, with the other being junior Matt Lazzaro, who was named an All-American as a sophomore.


  That attack line still hangs out together, working out at Greco's grandparents' house in Mashpee.


  "We are just so close-knit," Greco said. "The chemistry is always there ... I think this year was supposed to be our statement year. Last year we were just young kids and now we are two seniors and a junior. I think we definitely could have been one of the top attack lines in the state."


  While Greco and Davis likely won't be able to play with the rest of their teammates again, the two will both be continuing their lacrosse careers at UMass Lowell, where they will also be rooming together.


  "Off the field, too, it just goes to show that we are pretty close and I think it just translates, quite honestly," Greco said.


  The Panthers will still have a strong team coming back in 2021, with Lazzaro leading the charge along with the likes of Owen Palmieri, Ben and Zach Harvey, Tim Walsh, Jack Maguire, Mike Griffin and Jake's younger brother, Luke Davis, who will be a sophomore next year.


  "(Luke) is supposed to be the real deal," Verocchi said. "We've got some great kids."


  But as promising as the 2021 squad looks to be, it won't have quite the expectations for the 2020 squad.


  "We will still be very competitive in 2021," Verocchi said. "We've got some voids, not as strong as we would have been this year, but we will have a very good nucleus of kids coming back."


  The team still keeps in touch, hoping to be able to play together for one last time in the "Legacy Tournament" which is scheduled to take place July 13-14 in Devens.


  "We've been texting about that," Davis said. "Everybody is excited and is ready to go. It looks like its going to happen so at least we will have that one last hoo-rah together."


  Davis can't believe that he and his older brother, Will, played the same last high school game together even though they are one year apart. Will Davis played part of his freshman season of lacrosse at St. Anselm College this spring before its cancellation.


  "When he said it, it was just weird to think about," Davis said.


  "It's a lot to take in," Greco said. "To think that Duxbury game last year was my last game. These were all the kids that we grew up with, and to have that last opportunity stripped from you, it's sad."

A deep breath here and we'll attempt to explain further. You see, a Ferrari F40 isn't like other current exotic cars. In the last twenty years, the cars with the mile-­high price tags and headache-inducing acceleration have gone through a remarkable metamorphosis: they've become thoroughly domesticated. They have power windows and respectable air conditioners and enough room for six­-footers now. You can see out of them well enough to change lanes without saying Hail Mary first. You can hop into almost any of them and drive cross- country reasonably assured of emerging of sound mind and body.


  Not so the F40. It harks back to a time--the late 1950s and before--when makes like Ferrari, Maserati, Jaguar, and Porsche built sport and GT cars for the road that could be raced with a minimum of modifications. Some started life as high-strung racers and were barely tamed for the street. We're talking about cars like the original Testarossa, the Jag C- and D-types, the Porsche 550 Spyder. The Ford GT40 Mark III is the lone American car that follows this blueprint.

“Being able to see inside the park, it doesn’t get much better than that.”


  Major League Baseball suspended spring training on March 12, and the season that was scheduled to open on March 26 never did. Last week, players and owners reached an agreement to play an abbreviated, 60-game season that would start July 23 or 24 in teams’ home ballparks.


  But they’re not yet ready to crowd the seats with tens of thousands of fans.


  Instead, those hoping to see a game in person may have to settle for places like the Bleacher Bar, the Rogers Centre hotel or the Wrigley rooftops, pressing their face up to the windows or squinting through fences like the Knothole Gangs of yore.


  The Roberto Clemente Bridge provides a look into PNC Park and a hotel in Baltimore might offer rooms with a view of the field at Camden Yards.


  “There is some irony in the fact that the kind of social areas that we’ve created in baseball parks may end up being the key to the social distancing that may be required when we do see the sport again,” baseball architect Janet Marie Smith said. “I think there’s some, yeah, some sort of cruel irony in that.”


  Smith, who helped build the paradigm-shifting Camden Yards and worked on renovations for Dodger Stadium and Fenway, said ballpark designers have tried to find new ways to connect with their urban surroundings after moving back from the suburbs in the 1990s.


  The result: a picnic area in San Diego, a waterfront promenade in San Francisco, a street plaza in Baltimore, a nightclub in Miami.


  And now those new knotholes could be a foot in the door for fans if teams and government officials deem them safe to open before the actual seating bowls.


  “We’re seeing that the mixture of uses bode well for a lot of situations,” Smith said. “We weren’t looking for this one, for sure. But it does allow one to tiptoe back in and have a lighter touch than the traditional way of thinking of a stadium or ballpark with all fixed seating.”


  Most teams contacted by The Associated Press last week said they were following guidance from local officials on whether fans would be allowed to watch games from these areas. In many states, a key distinction is whether they are designed for ticketed fans or outside the turnstiles; in Massachusetts, for example, the Bleacher Bar can reopen as a restaurant even while Fenway and other large arenas remain closed.


  The Toronto Marriott City Centre is awaiting word from the Blue Jays on whether it can rent out the 70 rooms with perfect views of the field, general manager Anup Israni said. (As of Friday, the hotel had “Baseball Stadium view” rooms available for booking for late July and into August.)


  A Chicago Cubs spokesman said it has not been decided if the rooftops along Waveland and Sheffield Avenues will be open.


  San Francisco’s Portwalk, a promenade next to McCovey Cove that has views into Oracle Park, will remain closed, a Giants spokeswoman said. Kayakers are still hoping to paddle around, scrambling for splash shots.


  The Clevelander Marlins Park, a nightclub with a swimming pool beyond the left field fence in Miami, also will not open, the team said. The San Diego Padres said the Park at the Park, a ticketed grassy area beyond the center field fence, will be closed for the regular season; it will be open for the spring training reboot, though, with fans required to social distance.


  Eutaw Street, which runs beyond the right field wall in Baltimore, helped popularize the trend toward seatless viewing areas. On game days, it is typically filled with fans who hawk for home runs or purchase sandwiches at Boog’s BBQ.


  But it is inside the Camden Yards gates, and it will remain closed, the team said. It was also off limits when the Orioles played a game without fans in 2015 because of protests over Freddie Gray’s death in police custody -- until now, the only major league game played without fans in the ballpark.


  Some resourceful Orioles fans watched that game by crowding onto balconies at the Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor, which offers a mostly unobstructed but distant view of the field. (For now, the hotel is closed because of COVID-19 and is not taking reservations until July 14 at the earliest, a Hilton Hotels spokesman said.)


  Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has ruled out fans in the Fenway seats through at least August.


  “I just anticipate it being extremely odd when we get going playing Major League Baseball games in front of no fans, it being a strange environment,” Red Sox president Sam Kennedy said this week.

DeSantis believes these measures are reminding residents they need to be careful. "Now, people understand, this thing doesn't just go away," he says. "You can do a lot of things if you take some small precautions." The rising numbers of cases of coronavirus have raised questions about DeSantis' leadership and his close ties to President Trump, whom he consulted before allowing businesses to begin reopening.


  Democratic Congresswoman Donna Shalala, who represents parts of Miami says, "In their rush to reopen, they've put politics ahead of public health." Shalala says DeSantis made a mistake by not acting sooner to shut the state down. "We needed at the beginning to hit his virus with a hammer, to starve it all the way down," she says. "We didn't do the right thing in the beginning, and now we're trying to play catch-up."
