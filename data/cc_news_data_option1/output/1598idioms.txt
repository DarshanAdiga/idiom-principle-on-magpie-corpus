The contracts with Sky and BT will be watertight, the broadcasting of live matches is in their hands, unless the ­Premier League wanted to break a multi-billion pound deal. Unlikely.                     They are ­desperate to get back to fulfil the deal.                     In light of wiped-out ­advertising revenue, subscription ­cancellations and the future hit they are going to take in the inevitable recession, the broadcasters are unlikely to be overly keen on giving much away.                     Understandable, but in the rights to broadcast Premier League games, they will have a gift that will at least give the nation a semblance of a lift.                     Again, I am no big fan of quarantined football but it is unarguable the first ­Premier League game back will be a landmark match.                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Former Australia fast bowler Peter Siddle's return to county champions Essex has been delayed until at least 2021 after the coronavirus put paid to the start of this year's English season, he announced Thursday.           The 35-year-old took 34 wickets at an impressive average of 20.08 in eight matches last year as Essex won the County Championship First Division title.          He had been all set for a return to the county's headquarters in Chelmsford, east of London.          But with the pandemic bringing cricket to a standstill worldwide and suspending the start of the English season until at least May 28, with further delays looking likely, Siddle and Essex have agreed to hold his deal over until next year.          "It's a shame I won't be returning to Chelmsford this year as I was really looking forward to the season with the Eagles, but there are plenty of things more important than cricket going on in the world at the moment," said Siddle.          "In light of the current situation, it makes sense for me to come back over for the 2021 season when hopefully we're back to normal and playing cricket again," added Siddle, who took 221 wickets in 67 Tests and helped Australia retain the Ashes last year.          Several counties have either postponed or completely cancelled contracts with overseas players as a result of the ongoing pandemic, with Australia batsman Peter Handscomb saying earlier Thursday that his deal to captain Middlesex was "on hold".          Meanwhile doubts remain over whether Australian lockdown regulations that ban citizens from overseas travel will allow Sussex coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, currently in Adelaide, to take up his post with the south coast club should the English season get underway.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Matt Kelley, health officer for Gallatin County, told the board he had assumed the state’s plan would have given a week’s notice before reopening. That’s not the case as it allows places of worship to hold onsite services beginning Sunday and Main Street and retail businesses to open their doors on Monday as long as they adhere to social distancing guidelines.
 Kelley recommended that the board stay in line with Gov. Steve Bullock’s plan, saying Montana and Gallatin County have been successful in flattening the curve of COVID-19 cases.
 “I think it’s imperative we remain united during this time,” Kelley said.
 Becky Franks, chair of the board, noted that the board’s decision does not mean businesses in the area are required to open and that they can stay closed if necessary.
 Kelley said as businesses reopen, there likely will be an increase in case numbers as people begin to interact again, and that vulnerable citizens with pre-existing conditions should still plan to stay at home to avoid catching the disease.
 Christopher Coburn, a board member, said during the meeting he would support the measure, but that if he was considering the policy solely based on the risk to public health, he would want the restrictions to stay in place longer.
 “I don’t think it’s in the best interest of public health,” Coburn said.
 Coburn said that because there are other factors at play, he’d vote in favor of the measure.
 Joe Skinner, another board member and county commissioner, said the goal of closing businesses and other gathering places was to prevent a spike in cases that would overload the health care system before it was ready, and that the goal has been accomplished.
 “I think we've done that. It was never about eradicating the disease,” Skinner said.

The Gautam Budh Nagar police department has urged the public to beware of cyber fraud cases amid the ongoing lockdown and has also advised people to steer clear of any suspicious messages and links that offer "free tests".
 Police said there have been a few cases wherein people have been defrauded of money after clicking on such links.
 "It is not a very significant number but there have been isolated incidents. Some people have also lost money to a fake PMCares fund ID. The idea of issuing the advisory is to ensure that such cases don't pick up in the days to come," Ashok Kumar Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, said.
 According to police, most of these frauds are perpetrated through social media sites and range from fraudsters asking for money from victims as a fee for conducting a medical test to determine Covid-19 or by cloning the social media ID of a person and then asking that person's friends and relatives for money citing some difficulty. In some cases, the fraudsters offer free telecom recharges, police said.
 "If any demands for money are made through social media, people should verify if the information is true and only make any money transfer. Also don't clicks on links send via text messages, offering free recharges or free services," the advisory issued by the district cyber cell said.
 The advisory further said unverified messages or links related to Covid-19 medical tests or provision of essential services should be ignored. On April 18, an engineer was duped of ₹1.5 lakh in the name of donating to a relief fund. According to the complainant, he received a call and the caller asked if he would want to donate money help those in distress and the engineer agreed. The fraud happened in eight instalments and a case was registered at the Sector 39 police station.
 In another incident, a Sector 77 resident was duped of ₹80,000 on the pretext of online delivery of liquor after he clicked on an ad on a social media site. The victim had placed an order for ₹6,200 after which he was sent a QR code. The fraud happened after the code was scanned and a case was later registered at the Sector 49 police station.
 In the district, most cyber fraud cases are related to unified payments interface (UPI) and KYC of e-wallets, followed by fake offers of lottery and jobs. The third most reported offence is bogus ATM withdrawls. In 2019, the cyber cell received 3,050 complaints related to various online frauds. When the commissionerate was formed in January, cyber crime became a special focus area and the department was working on revamping the cell before the lockdown was put in place.

Chandigarh The faculty members at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) have demanded that all patients visiting the tertiary care institute be tested to rule out possibility of coronavirus infection spread.The faculty association raised the issue after a six-month-old baby admitted to the institute with a cardiac problem tested positive for the coronavirus disease in a pre-operative test, following which 54 health workers were quarantined and tested negative. The association has highlighted that the infection among healthcare workers ranges from 10-20% all over the world and has been reported from medical Institutes in India as well. "PGIMER should take only referred patients at least from district/state hospital as per SGPGI pattern and there should be no direct registration. The issue may be taken up with chief secretaries of adjoining states," a press release from the association said."Patients should also get tested in their local designated state and medical college lab in order to avoid delays at the PGIMER," said Dr JS Thakur, president of the association.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said the demand was under active consideration of the administration and a decision in this regard is expected shortly. "We will not go with haphazard testing, but also feel that all incoming patients should be screened and tested for Covid-19," Ram said.OTHER ISSUES FLAGGEDThakur said the PGIMER administration is putting efforts for provision of mask and personal protection equipment as per the institute guidelines but there are still issues related to equitable distribution which need to be addressed."The protocol which the institute has, has been refined four times, but we need to ensure that what is on paper is being followed on the ground too," Thakur said.General secretary of the association, Dr Arun Bansal, said, "The main focus of the administration is the screening of Covid-19 and the Nehru Extension Block where the patients concerned are. However, doctors from other areas, where some surgery or procedure is to be conducted, should be provided better safety gear."

Kemp instead gave the plum gig to sports executive Kelly Loeffler, who is rich enough to self-fund a special election campaign and is allegedly appealing to the suburban women who have been abandoning the GOP in Georgia lately (though Loeffler has been under intense scrutiny over her suspicious coronavirus- related stock trades).

One of the mayors for Liverpool has called for an investigation into why Liverpool's Champions League clash against Atletico Madrid was allowed to go ahead in front of 52,000 supporters last month.
 Despite the game taking place after a plan was agreed to play La Liga matches behind closed doors, 3,000 visiting fans were allowed to travel from Spain and attend the match at Anfield on March 11.
 Days later Spain was forced into a nationwide lockdown and mass gatherings, including all major sporting events, in Britain were cancelled.
 Madrid has been one of the European cities worst-hit by coronavirus and the Spanish capital's mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said it had been a "mistake" to play the game.
 "If people have contracted coronavirus as a direct result of a sporting event that we believe shouldn't have taken place, well that is scandalous," Steve Rotheram, Mayor of Liverpool City Region, told the BBC.
 "That needs to be investigated to find out whether some of those infections are due directly to the Atletico fans. There were coronavirus hot cities, and Madrid was one of those.
 "They weren't allowed to congregate in their own country, but 3,000 of those fans came over to ours, and potentially may well have spread coronavirus.
 "So it does need looking at, and it does need the government to take some responsibility for not locking down sooner."
 The UK government has insisted it was following scientific advice when it allowed the match and other major events such as the Cheltenham horse racing festival to go ahead in the same week.
 However, the British government's deputy chief scientific adviser, Angela McLean, said on Monday that infections in Liverpool due to the Atletico match was an "interesting hypothesis".
 Atletico won the game 3-2 after extra-time to knock out the defending champions 4-2 on aggregate and progress to the quarter-finals.

The victim had placed an order for ₹6,200 after which he was sent a QR code. The fraud happened after the code was scanned and a case was later registered at the Sector 49 police station. In the district, most cyber fraud cases are related to unified payments interface (UPI) and KYC of e-wallets, followed by fake offers of lottery and jobs. The third most reported offence is bogus ATM withdrawls. In 2019, the cyber cell received 3,050 complaints related to various online frauds. When the commissionerate was formed in January, cyber crime became a special focus area and the department was working on revamping the cell before the lockdown was put in place.

The name and logo of China’s first Mars exploration mission will be made public on China’s Space Day tomorrow, according to the China National Space Administration.          China plans to launch the Mars probe this year, aiming to complete orbiting, landing and roving in one mission.          Since 2016, China has set April 24 as the country’s Space Day to mark the launch of its first satellite “Dongfanghong-1” into space on April 24, 1970. This year will be the 50th anniversary of the start of China’s entry into space.          The various activities on Space Day have become a window for the Chinese public and the world to get a better understanding of China’s progress in space. Over the past year, China has made efforts to push forward the development of space science. China’s Chang’e-4 probe, which landed on the far side of the moon at the beginning of last year, has survived for more than 16 lunar days on the virgin territory, and Yutu-2 has become the longest-working lunar rover.          The probe is in good condition, and has made a large number of scientific discoveries, said Ge Xiaochun, chief engineer of the CNSA.          China promotes aerospace innovation, and its largest carrier rocket, the Long March-5, made a new flight at the end of 2019. China has successfully launched a carrier rocket at sea, and also pushes the development of lunar exploration and the construction of a high-resolution Earth-observation system.          Space technology has benefited China’s economic and social development. During the COVID-19 epidemic, China’s Gaofen Earth-observation satellites and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System provided services for the construction of makeshift hospitals.          China is deepening international cooperation and exchanges in aerospace development.          China promotes international space cooperation to contribute to achieving the sustainable development goals set by the United Nations.          China shared the data of its Gaofen satellites with other countries and provided services for countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. The CNSA invited scientists from around the world to participate in the Chang’e-6 lunar exploration mission and asteroid exploration mission.          The China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite-4A was launched at the end of 2019, setting an example for space cooperation among developing countries. The China-France Oceanography Satellite was sent into space in 2018.          Despite the risks of space exploration, China will not cease its development and innovation in space science, technology and application, Ge said.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

NORTH OGDEN — Mike Call, whose North Ogden gym had to shut its doors early this month due to coronavirus restrictions, still recalls the turn of events with a measure of chagrin.
 “It does hurt quite a bit,” he said.
 Since closing after Weber County officials issued a public health order on April 2 calling for a range of businesses to halt operations — at least for now — around 140 customers have either canceled or frozen their memberships. To make ends meet, Call has taken a temporary job at a manufacturing plant, operated by his father, that’s been deemed essential and is still open.
 Call is eager to reopen his business, Snap Fitness. And leaders from Weber, Morgan and Davis counties provided a glimmer of hope Wednesday for him and other impacted business operators. At a joint press conference, the officials announced that restrictions on businesses meant to help slow the spread of coronavirus would be eased starting May 2, potentially allowing shuttered operations to reopen. Industry-specific guidelines, still to be released, would apply, but even so it represents a thawing of the coronavirus-inspired rules that have caused many Weber County businesses to close or scale back operations.
 “I’m excited about it,” Call said.
 At the same time, Call — offering the perspective of a businessman directly impacted by the situation — is disappointed at how the process unfolded, leading to implementation of restrictions in the first place. It’s not that coronavirus isn’t a threat. Rather, Call maintains that business operators are cognizant of such things and should have been given more leeway to deal with the issue on their own. Moreover, the number of coronavirus cases in Weber County, lower than in Utah’s other more populated counties, didn’t seem to represent an outsized threat, according to Call.
 “I’m still disappointed we weren’t able to make decisions on our own,” Call said. If a business wasn’t already implementing measures to guard against coronavirus, as he was when the April 2 county health order forced him to shut his doors, “they were basically committing business suicide.”
 That is, he says business operators will take the needed measures to safeguard against things like coronavirus because it’s good business practice. Customers, likewise, will act on their own. If they’re not comfortable due to things like coronavirus, they’ll stay home or limit their movements.
 In the case of Snap Fitness, Call says he had limited the number of customers allowed into the gym at any one time as a preventive measure against coronavirus. He regularly cleaned equipment, and he provided each customer with a bottle of disinfectant so they could also clean equipment before each use. Regardless, gym attendance had declined as customers decided on their own courses of action.
 “I personally feel that the business should have the option and the customer should have the option to continue the services,” he said.
 Call’s dismay underscores the upswell of condemnation voiced by some at restrictions implemented nationwide to quell the spread of coronavirus — restrictions blasted by critics as the heavy hand of government.
 Weber County officials, however, defended the restrictions implemented, similar to guidelines implemented elsewhere in Utah’s more populated areas. Gyms, hair salons, theaters and other businesses where people come in close contact have had to halt operations while eateries are allowed only to offer take-out service.
 “We’ve been data driven from day one,” said Weber County Commissioner Gage Froerer, dismissing suggestions that the directives didn’t have a basis in science. He said it’s been a “balancing act” for officials, weighing health and economic factors.
 Similarly, Brian Bennion, director of the Weber-Morgan Health Department, said the coronavirus measures and directives didn’t come out of thin air. And without them, the county would likely have seen a higher coronavirus case count.
 “My point of view is we acted as we should’ve at the right time. It wasn’t done in the closet,” he said.
 Kim Bowsher, executive director of Ogden Downtown Alliance, a coalition of downtown businesses, hasn’t seen a swell of opposition to coronavirus restrictions here. Protestors last Saturday gathered in Salt Lake City to voice opposition to restrictions on business, but she hasn’t seen that sort of sentiment in the Ogden area, at least not in a widespread way.
 Whatever the case, Call says most people are eager to see stores resume operations, a sentiment Froerer said he hears too.
 “The majority of people want business to resume and they feel safe,” Call said.
 Businesses in Weber, Davis and Morgan counties allowed to reopen May 2 will still face guidelines meant to safeguard against coronavirus. Brian Hatch, executive director of the Davis County Health Department, said social- distancing guidelines would likely apply and businesses might have to regularly clean and sanitize equipment that gets steady use. Use of masks, too, might be required or advised.

With the coronavirus outbreak raging on and testing patients becoming an uphill task for hospital administration, the Panchkula health department will now be setting up its own Covid-19 testing lab, likely by the end of the month. Officials in the know said the process had begun at the Sector 6 civil hospital in the district.
 As per information, the hospital administration has finalised a space near the psychiatric ward on the fourth floor of Block C, and a team will be checking the premises to install the machine. Currently, the district health department is dependent on Chandigarh's PGIMER and the Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College in Karnal, where blood samples are sent for tests.
 On this, Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said the health department was working to set up the project and aims to open the lab at the civil hospital in the next week. "Installation is underway at a quick pace. Some machinery parts are awaited. It is being calibrated and staff is being trained for it," said Dr Kaur.
 She also said one machine will be installed in the premises will cater to Panchkula residents. It will streamline the process of collecting samples and cut down the waiting period of reports, other labs are deluged with the number of samples coming in every day. Officials said when the lab opens next week, they would first hold a trial. It has been learnt that the machine will test 80 samples at a time.
 750 rapid kits, but stay on their use
 To collect more samples in Panchkula, the district's health department has also got around 750 rapid test kits. Officials said that till now, only those with travel history, their contacts persons and suspected patients who visit the hospital were being tested. But with several confirmed cases which were asymptomatic, more people will need to be tested.
 Meanwhile, these rapid test kits cannot be used for the time being in absence of permission from higher authorities. Civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said, "We have got more than 750 testing kits, but currently their utilisation has been stayed, as we are following the directions of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)."

According to Mother Jones, the at-home rape kits have been donated to Monterey County by a company called the Preserve Group, which is one of two DIY rape kit companies, both of which came under fire last year when they were accused of trying to profit off trauma. The other rape kit company, The MeTooKit Company, wrote to lobbyists in New Hampshire earlier this month, promoting its kit as a way to "save countless lives," Mother Jones reports. Both the Preserve Group and MeTooKits have said they are not interested in selling their products, and are offering to donate them.        *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The other thing they got right was suggesting that you select a backup size when ordering. You can add in a backup bra for no extra charge, which makes so much sense. This way, you have a few to try on at home, under the actual clothes you'll be wearing, and there are fewer back and forth trips to the post office with returns.

"Now it's like we're circling, waiting to land," Wentz said. "Nobody knows anything and it's hard because we really want to do this tour. It was a hard thing to orchestrate because there are three bands, you have to figure out who's doing what and everyoen had to really want it. I know as much as you do about what's going to happen with it."
 When the trek was first announced late last year, rock fans were shocked to hear the lineup. Coinciding with the announcement, all three bands dropped a new single, followed by an album. Green Day released their 13th studio album _Father of All …_, Weezer will drop their 14th LP _Van Weezer_ this year, and Fall Out Boy revealed the compilation album _Greatest Hits: Believers Never Die (Volume Two)_ to follow their seventh studio record, _Mania_.
 "When Green Day plays songs like 'Basket Case', those songs are so massive it's like they're baked into people's DNA," Wentz said. "Fall Out Boy aren't there yet. Is that somewhere we could potentially get to? Yeah, I believe so."

One of the most common mistakes that many Australian brands consistently make is having the content focus on the brand and products that are featured. This is something that users catch on to pretty fast and it loses their interest. For example, professionals from Melbourne seo agency advise that all you need is content that focuses on the content itself, instead of just being a vehicle for advertising. If you create enticing content, you’ll find that it will quickly draw-in consumers left and right. The question is: how do you improve the visibility and effectiveness of your website’s content?

In Africa, COVID-19 cases rose 43% in the past week, up from 16,000 to 26,000 cases, according to John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The figures underscored a recent warning from the World Health Organization that the virus could kill more than 300,000 people in Africa and push 30 million into desperate poverty.          Huge lines have formed at food banks from El Paso, Texas, to the Paris suburbs, and food shortages are hitting Africa especially hard.          The European Union has pledged 20 billion euros ($22 billion) to help vulnerable communities globally. EU leaders scheduled a virtual summit Thursday to take stock of the damage the crisis has inflicted on the bloc’s own citizens and to work out an economic rescue plan.          The coronavirus has killed over 184,000 people worldwide, including about 47,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from official government figures. The true numbers are almost certainly far higher.          In the U.S., the economic consequences of the shutdowns have sparked angry rallies in state capitals by protesters demanding that businesses reopen, and President Donald Trump has expressed impatience over the restrictions. Some governors have begun easing up despite warnings from health authorities that it may be too soon to do so without sparking new infections. In Georgia, gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys can reopen Friday. Texas has reopened its state parks.          The high unemployment levels of the Great Depression lasted for a decade and peaked at around 25%. U.S. officials hope for a quicker recovery this time, although there may be more layoffs to come from many small businesses that tried in vain to receive loans from a federal aid program.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

LUSAIL, CATAR.- Catar continúa con la construcción de estadios e infraestructuras para el Mundial de fútbol de 2022, afirmando que se respetan las reglas de distancia social para limitar los riesgos de propagación del nuevo coronavirus entre los trabajadores, en su mayor parte extranjeros, constataron este jueves periodistas de la AFP. Decenas de obreros vestidos de azul y con los rostros cubiertos por tejidos, más o menos improvisados, trabajan en el 'esqueleto' del estadio de Lusail, que acogerá la final del próximo Mundial. Todos guardan una cierta distancia entre ellos en las obras de construcción de este recinto, que debe convertirse en el más grande del país, con 80,000 plazas en total. El comité encargado de la organización del campeonato afirmó en un comunicado que 'reexamina la situación de manera continua y que está dispuesto a tomar las medidas necesarias para proteger la salud y la seguridad de todos los obreros y del personal'. 'Esas medidas pueden incluir la suspensión temporal del trabajo (en las obras) si es necesario', añadieron. Hasta ahora, los organizadores del Mundial-2022 afirmaron haber registrado ocho casos de infecciones por el Covid-19 en las obras de tres estadios. Desde hace seis días no se ha dado ningún balance al respecto. Las autoridades cataríes declararon oficialmente 7,764 casos de infectados, con resultado de diez fallecimientos. A partir del domingo, llevar mascarilla será obligatorio para toda persona que trabaje en el sector de la construcción, anunciaron las autoridades del país. Los autocares que llevan a los empleados a su lugar de trabajo hasta su domicilio deben vigilar que sus pasajeros se sientan también de una manera espaciada dentro del vehículo, igualmente para limitar una eventual propagación del coronavirus. Según organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONG), las condiciones de vida y de trabajo de los trabajadores migrantes en el Golfo les dejan especialmente expuestos al riesgo de infección por Covid-19.
