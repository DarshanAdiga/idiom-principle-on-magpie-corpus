Plans to remove the Grant Park statue were first reported Thursday night by the Chicago Tribune and the removal followed hours of vocal confrontations between opponents and supporters of the statue. On July 17, protesters had clashed with police, who used batons to beat people and made arrests after they say protesters targeted them with fireworks, rocks and other items.


  "This statue coming down is because of the effort of Black and Indigenous activists who know the true history of Columbus and what he represents," Stefan Cuevas-Caizaguano, a resident watching the removal, told the Chicago Sun-Times.


  Both the Grant Park and Arrigo Park statues were vandalized last month. Statues of Columbus have also been toppled or vandalized in other U.S. cities as protesters have called for the removal of statues of Columbus, saying that he is responsible for the genocide and exploitation of native peoples in the Americas.


  Pasquale Gianni of the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans said the mayor had told him before their removal that both statues would be moved and temporarily housed elsewhere for public safety reasons.


  “The Italian American community feels betrayed. The Mayor’s Office is giving into a vocal and destructive minority. This is not how the Democratic process is supposed to work,” he told WLS-TV.


  Lightfoot and the city planned to announce a process "to assess each of the monuments, memorials, and murals across Chicago's communities, and develop a framework for creating a public dialogue to determine how we elevate our city's history and diversity," the mayor's office added in its statement.


  The removals come amid a plan by President Donald Trump to dispatch federal law enforcement agents to the city to respond to gun violence, prompting worries that the surge will inhibit residents’ ability to hold demonstrations. A collection of activist groups had filed suit Thursday, seeking to block federal agents to combat violent crime from interfering in or policing protests.


  State officials in Oregon had sued for similar requests following the arrival of federal law enforcement due to nearly two months of protests in Portland since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

  This story has been corrected to indicate that the lawsuit by activists was filed Thursday, not Wednesday.

The field is set for the November general election and more than likely the races were decided on July 14. We had some good races, including the race for our junior U.S. Senate seat as well as two open congressional seats.


   


  Tommy Tuberville won an impressive 60-40 victory over Jeff Sessions in the GOP primary runoff for U.S. Senate. The tea leaves portend that the Republican Tuberville will defeat the Democrat Doug Jones by that same 60-40 margin. Tuberville will win for one reason. He is a solid Republican in a solidly Republican state.


   


  Winning the GOP nomination for a U.S. Senate seat, and for that matter any statewide office, is tantamount to election in Alabama. We are a very hardcore, safe, red Republican state, especially in a presidential year. It is also a very safe assumption to say that Donald Trump will carry Alabama in the presidential contest, and Trump's coattails should assure a Tuberville victory.


   


  The two open congressional seats in the 1st and 2nd districts are very safely Republican seats. Therefore, the winners Jerry Carl and Barry Moore can start packing for Washington, D.C.


   


  A not-so-subtle participation occurred in our GOP primaries in Alabama this year. Generally, Republican-leaning political action committees, like the Chamber of Commerce, stay out of party primaries and save their ammunition for the general election battle against Democrats. However, there is a giant that does not play by those rules. This giant is the Club for Growth - a right-wing PAC that promotes Republican candidates who adhere to a free market, free trade, anti-regulation agenda. They also believe and advocate for cutting income taxes and repealing the estate tax. Therefore, as you might guess, the money given to the Club for Growth comes from deep-pocketed, very wealthy, very conservative right-wing Americans. They dig deep into their pockets and write big checks primarily to Republican candidates.


   


  As a political observer, it is apparent to me that these Big Daddy Warbucks political wannabe players have more money than sense. Anybody with walking- around sense knows that anybody elected to a Republican U.S. Senate seat or Republican congressional seat in Alabama is going to be a conservative pro- business vote in Washington.


   


  Whichever candidate won the 1st District congressional race was going to vote the same. Yet the Club for Growth spent over $1 million on behalf of Jerry Carl's opponent. In the 2nd congressional runoff, the Club for Growth donated over $750,000 on behalf of Barry Moore against Jeff Coleman, either of whom would have voted conservatively or pro-business.


   


  In the U.S. Senate first primary race, the Club for Growth spent nearly $700,000 to keep Bradley Byrne out of the Senate runoff.


   


  This $2.7 million was spent in negative advertisements against their opponents, who again are fellow Republicans who are going to vote identically as the other. They gave their candidates another $300,000 for positive ads. That is $3 million in Alabama.


   


  My question to whoever runs the Club for Growth is, "Do you not think that your money would be put to better use to help Republican U.S. Senate incumbents that are in close re-election contests in Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Montana, and North Carolina?" These conservative Republican incumbents are trailing in the polls, as well as behind in fundraising. In short, whoever is calling the shots for the Club for Growth is essentially a political imbecile.


   


  If the Republicans lose the U.S. Senate, then the liberal Democrats will nail those rich idiots' hides to the wall, and they deserve it. However, Alabama does not deserve it nor can we afford it.


   


  If the Republicans lose the majority in the U.S. Senate, our crown jewel, Republican senior U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby, loses the chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Alabama loses all its power and influence in Washington. You will have a say in that. Currently, national pundits have the Democrat, Jones, losing in Alabama to the Republican, Tuberville.


   


  However, that is no guarantee. The national Democrats would love to use Jones as a Democratic vehicle to take control of the U.S. Senate and give the chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee to a liberal Democrat. Therefore, philosophy aside, economically a vote for Jones is a vote against Richard Shelby and the state of Alabama.

“We are going to expose corruption under the Obama-Biden administration in Ukraine,” Telizhenko said. “There’s a lot of new information still to come.”


  Telizhenko’s Ukrainian collaborators, whose names surfaced during the Trump impeachment saga, include a fugitive, a tainted former prosecutor, and the son of a KGB officer who also was trained in Russian spy techniques.


  Andriy Derkach was schooled at a KGB academy in Moscow. He became a Ukrainian lawmaker and is remembered for voting for a Kremlin-like set of anti-protest laws that passed during the country’s pro-democracy revolution in 2014.


  Kostyantyn Kulyk is a former military prosecutor charged with but never convicted of corruption. He has been accused of pursuing politically motivated criminal cases against his opponents and has admitted having ties to a warlord in eastern Ukraine accused of working for Russian intelligence services.


  Oleksandr Onyshchenko is a gas industry tycoon and former lawmaker in the now-defunct pro-Russia Party of Regions. Accused of embezzlement in his home country, he is now on the run.

After a court in Jaipur ordered a probe into Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s alleged role in a multi-crore scam involving Sanjivani Credit Cooperative Society, the Congress on Friday again demanded his resignation.


  It said the scam was to the tune of ₹884 crore and called it the ‘biggest ponzi scheme’ in Rajasthan which, it alleged, has the involvement of Vikram Singh, a close aide of the Minister.


  Mr. Singh, who is a director of the Sanjivani Society, has been is in judicial custody since September 2019 on forgery charge and in connection with other cases as well.


  The Congress had alleged that Mr. Shekhawat was behind efforts to topple the Ashok Gehlot government, released audio clips to back its claims and demanded his resignation.


  “Vikram Singh ji is associated with Gajendra Shekhawat ji in several other companies...The Congress demands the immediate resignation of Mr. Shekhawat whose name has come up in the Sanjivani scam,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera told reporters at a virtual press conference.


  The party alleged that investors’ money was transferred to the Society employees and then to other companies that bought properties in India and abroad, including 2,500 hectares in Ethiopia, a part of which was used for banana cultivation.


  The Congress also slammed Central agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate, the Income Tax Department and the CBI for not investigating the scam.


  “Mr. Shekhawat is trying to make us a Banana Republic while growing bananas in Ethiopia….He has no address for these [Central] agencies,” Mr. Khera said.

Lampedusa, 24 lug. (Adnkronos) - "Siamo partiti un po' dubbiosi, il timore era di trovare un'isola quasi invasa, invece, non ci siamo accorti proprio di nulla. Gli sbarchi? Abbiamo continuato a leggere i numeri dai giornali". Seduta al tavolino di un locale nella centralissima via Roma a Lampedusa la comitiva di turisti milanesi si gode "l'ottimo pescato".

Most of the things I had planned this summer didn’t end up happening, but there is something I hadn’t planned on that DID happen. And that thing is my 8th studio album, folklore. Surprise ��Tonight at midnight I’ll be releasing my entire brand new album of songs I’ve poured all of my whims, dreams, fears, and musings into. I wrote and recorded this music in isolation but got to collaborate with some musical heroes of mine; @aarondessner (who has co- written or produced 11 of the 16 songs), @boniver (who co-wrote and was kind enough to sing on one with me), William Bowery (who co-wrote two with me) and @jackantonoff (who is basically musical family at this point). Engineered by Laura Sisk and Jon Low, mixed by Serban Ghenea & Jon Low. The album photos were shot by the amazing @bethgarrabrant. Before this year I probably would’ve overthought when to release this music at the ‘perfect’ time, but the times we’re living in keep reminding me that nothing is guaranteed. My gut is telling me that if you make something you love, you should just put it out into the world. That’s the side of uncertainty I can get on board with. Love you guys so much ♥️

Purpose is all about the “why” of being in business. As a leader, you need to clearly articulate what problem you are trying to address and the value you are adding to customers, and to the world. Without a clearly defined purpose, employees have no shared intent; there is no central rallying cry for your employees. When you let your purpose drive your business strategy, you take a more unified, holistic approach to decision-making and actions.

 BERLIN, July 22 (Reuters) - German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer aims to clear the way for an almost blanket motorway toll for cars across Germany and Europe during the country's presidency of the European Union, a draft document seen by Reuters on Wednesday showed.
 Within eight years, almost all vehicles on motorways, including lorries, vans and cars, would have to pay tolls, according to the draft for the EU toll directive.
 "As regards member states that have already established a charging system, tolls or user charges shall be levied upon all vehicles except coaches and buses," stated the document which Scheuer wants German ministries to approve on Wednesday.
 That would make it Germany's official proposal for its presidency of the bloc which started on July 1 and runs until the end of the year.
 However, some government officials told Reuters that some German ministries wanted to put the project on ice even though a distance-based toll is widely seen as a measure to help protect the climate.
 It is particularly sensitive for ministries headed by the Social Democrats (SPD), who share power with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and have long been critical of car tolls. (Reporting by Markus Wacket Writing by Madeline Chambers Editing by Michelle Martin)

SYDNEY, July 22 (Reuters) - Former Wallabies prop Pek Cowan had only one thought when the Western Force were included in the domestic Super Rugby AU competition - he was coming home to play for the only professional Australian side he had ever known.
 Cowan was a foundation member of the Force in 2006 and only left when the team was controversially dumped from Super Rugby in 2017. He has been playing in Japan since then.
 The novel coronavirus outbreak, however, forced rugby to shut down globally before Rugby Australia was able to organise their own domestic competition and invited the Force to join their existing four sides.
 Cowan jumped at the chance to add to his 130 caps for the Perth-based team.
 "As soon as I heard that we might have the opportunity to play Super Rugby again I thought there was no other team I would love to be a part of," Cowan told reporters on Wednesday.
 "There's a lot of emotion attached to a team that means a lot to me."
 The 34-year-old had to spend two weeks in quarantine and he acknowledged he was probably not quite ready to play on Saturday against the competition favourite ACT Brumbies.
 "I haven't been able to do a lot of the sessions just getting back but just watching the boys out there ... you can feel they want to do their best," he said.
 "That's something again that I'm really looking forward to being a part of."
 Playing in front of home fans in a few weeks, if travel restrictions allow for it, was also a spur for Cowan's return.
 "I know ... our supporters, the sea of blue, they're sitting there waiting for us to get home," he said.
 "For me, that would just be the ultimate for me to be able to chuck the jumper on and play there." (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)

Worse still, the consumption tax that provided the PTF resource was sourced mostly from the South, while over 75% of the projects executed with it were in the North. By the time the military was ready to hand over to the civilians in 1999, the Trust Fund had drawn much distrust. It had neither brought development, bridged the shortcomings of the agencies it tried to bail out, nor risen above board in many respects. But those benefiting from it had become even more determined to ensure that the incoming civilian regime of Obasanjo retained it. Thus, the media was approached, including some of us on The Guardian Newspapers Editorial Board, to drive a 'media consultancy' that would push a strong campaign, to arm-twist the then President-elect into not scrapping the PTF after being sworn in.

  MONTREAL--Quebec's annual two-week construction holiday is in full swing, and with many Quebecers staying closer to home this summer because of COVID-19, towns in the Gaspe region are seeing an influx of tourists drawn to the charming seaside landscapes.


  But the mayor of Gaspe, Que., a popular tourist destination on the Gaspe peninsula's eastern coast, is concerned some visitors are camping anywhere they find space, harming the environment and upsetting locals.


  "We're seeing a lot of tents on public beaches, in forests, on private land without the approval of the owners of that land," Mayor Daniel Cote said in an interview Thursday.


  Cote said he had high hopes tourists would come to the Gaspe this summer despite the pandemic. Authorities had closed off the region to outsiders earlier this year to stop the spread of COVID-19.


  But Cote said he was caught off guard by the number of tourists who arrived without hotel or camping reservations. "People invaded public beaches and decided that that's where they would set up camp," he said.


  A series of photos posted on Facebook Wednesday showed tents and camping chairs lined up along a beach, as well as empty beer cans and other garbage littering the sand. The Canadian Press could not independently verify the photos, which purportedly were taken at Haldimand Beach in Gaspe.


  The post was shared nearly 600 times as of Thursday afternoon and garnered over 300 comments, many of which criticize the tourists and demand the town take action. Cote said public beaches are under provincial authority, so the municipality has limited means to intervene.


  But he said Gaspe intends to hire people to patrol busy public areas and inform visitors of the rules, which include a ban on driving vehicles on public beaches and to safely dispose of trash.


  The town is also working with Quebec provincial police and the nearby Mi'kmaq Nation of Gespeg to protect the area, Cote added. "As a municipality we don't have coercive power to force people to leave the areas ... so we're going to go with raising awareness."


  In a statement Thursday, officials with the Mi'kmaq Nation of Gespeg said unregulated camping in the area had gotten "out of control" and was negatively affecting local wildlife and ecosystems.


  "On the beaches, washed up wood, which is important for slowing erosion, is being burned without knowledge of its consequences," the statement reads. "Migratory birds are being disturbed on their nesting grounds. We cannot even keep track of the amount of waste that litters the waters, the beaches, the parking lots, and rest areas."


  The regional public health authority launched an awareness campaign this month to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 in the Gaspe region amid the wave of tourists.


  Small teams are being deployed across the region to make sure people are respecting public health guidelines, explained Clemence Beaulieu-Gendron, a spokeswoman for CISSS de la Gaspesie. She said several local mayors have asked the public health teams to come to their towns.


  So far, a team of four outreach workers is working in the area of Sainte- Anne-des-Monts, on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, while others have been sent to Gaspe, Perce, and Carleton-sur-Mer.


  "They're not police. It's important to say that," Beaulieu-Gendron said about the workers, in an interview. "It's really to raise awareness to avoid a second wave, or in any case, to decrease the risk of spreading the virus in the region during summer vacation."


  Lily Gang, the owner of Motel-Camping Fort Ramsay in Gaspe, said this summer seems just as busy as in past years. Her business counts 32 motel rooms and 42 camp sites, which normally can accommodate both trailers and tents.


  But Gang said she chose not to take any reservations for tent camping this year because she felt uneasy with clients using the communal restrooms and showers during the COVID-19 pandemic. She said she also feared campers could put her cleaning staff at risk.


  "I don't know how to handle so many people together," Gang said in an interview.


  Cote said the region typically receives 800,000 visitors every summer, but this year he expects more. He said he intends to speak to the provincial government this fall to make sure the public beaches aren't overrun again next year.


  In the meantime, he encouraged tourists to plan their trips to the region ahead of time -- and only visit if they have reservations. "It will make us very happy to welcome you, as long as you behave respectfully towards people in the area."

One of the things we learned as pilots is the “GO, NO-GO” decision point. On a long flight over water, there is a point of no return to be able to get back to land safely. Or, just beginning the flight at all, continuing or not rather than carry on into marginal weather, or having some mechanical or system issue develop in the aircraft, so do you find the nearest airport and land or continue on? There is a common saying in aviation; “It’s better to be on the ground wishing you were in the air, rather than being in the air and wishing you were on the ground.” We know how to make good decisions, and decisions that are made to avoid real risks, not just an inconvenience.


  As director of the Highlands County Aviation and Aerospace Academy I have a responsibility to provide an effective and safe program. Besides a comprehensive curriculum, students are working with power tools in the construction of a full-size aircraft. Doing that safely is the top priority. This is my frame of mind as I monitor what is happening in the state of Florida, and in the counties surrounding Highlands County. The cases of COVID-19 are increasing at an alarming rate and it appears there is a lack of community discipline to do what has proven to help slow down the community spread. In my opinion, we have a “Cat-5” storm of COVID-19 infections headed our way, and it appears more could be done to prepare for it.


  Our school district has worked hard to find effective solutions to a complex problem, since we had to close schools last academic year. Hours and hours have been spent looking for the safest and most effective way to serve our students, faculty, staff and the community. I appreciate the plans the school district has made to make the schools as safe and sanitized as possible; but without the community making the same effort by wearing masks, social distancing, and minimizing trips outside the home, the virus will continue to spread. Our school district cannot solve this virus issue alone, it will need the cooperation of the community.


  The aviation program at the EAA hangar would require students to work shoulder-to-shoulder working on the aircraft in teams. After a student uses a tool, it has to be wiped down and sanitized before the next student uses the tool. The hangar classroom is not large enough to provide enough space for students to be spread out, even when we reduce the number of students in the program. Four of the five staff conducting the program are in the high-risk category and expressed a desire not to continue the program face to face until the spread of the virus is reduced and contained to safe levels. These considerations led to the decision to conduct the program remotely for the first semester of 2020.

Newsflash: women in their twenties are having less children than ever before. New data released by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed that the average age of women giving birth in 2019 was 30.7 years - a figure which has been gradually increasing since the 1970s.


  What's perhaps more interesting, though, is that fertility rates for women under the age of 30 are now at their lowest levels since records began all the way back in 1938, meaning that we're way less likely to have kids young than the generations before us. And, well, it's not exactly hard to see why.


  With maternity leave meaning you have to put your career on hold (not to mention the drop in income) - which can have a ripple effect in the years afterward - lots of women are waiting longer to take the plunge into motherhood so they can get ahead at work. Plus, with the cost of housing being so extortionate - and many people preferring _not_ to squeeze a child into their flat-share in Hackney - plenty are waiting until they're in a more stable position before they get pregnant.


  Overall, less babies are being born altogether (640,370 were welcomed to the world in England and Wales last year), but confirming the theory that's it's definitely deemed more preferable to wait longer to have a baby these days, the data also reveals the only age group to see an increase in fertility rates (so, the number of women having children) was women over the age of 40.

We have options. We conducted the program at the end of the last school year remotely and we can do it again. We will re-evaluate the COVID-19 situation in December and hopefully we will be able to continue face-to-face instruction in January for the second semester. There is no one more disappointed than me for having to do this. I miss “my” students. We formed a tight bond with the student teams bringing an AirCam to near completion for retired NASA astronaut Story Musgrave. These students are an amazing group that have attained incredible skills. They started the next AirCam build shortly before we shut down for the first round of COVID-19. They are eager to get back to “the build.”


  I understand and appreciate the concerns of parents when their children are not in school. As I indicated earlier, it is not just a school district issue and what the schools do to make the buildings safe, it is a community issue. Our first responsibility is for the safety of our children, teachers and staff. Our immediate action should be to require serious community mitigation efforts. I encountered a man recently in a store who was standing a foot behind me in line without a face mask. I asked him to give me the 6-foot space and then he proceeded to lecture me forcefully, saying I was the problem wearing a mask and staying 6 feet apart. He said he was free to breathe without a mask and would continue to do so when and where he wanted. You sir, and others with that attitude, are the problem.


  If we are going to contain the spread of the virus, the community needs to come together and do the right things that have proven to work. Put aside your ego, stubbornness, and your political soap boxes. This is a serious situation and will require a serious effort to make the changes to bring the virus under control. Businesses may consider adjusting work schedules and shifts so parents have more flexibility so they can be home for their children. We have to look after each other, and be patient and understanding. Are you ready and willing to do what needs to be done?

Maybe that’s why we’re worried about the fall.


  As the school year nears, routine preparations for the new session seem premature as leaders continue working to hash out what school will look like come September. And in all that planning, we worry for the children who inevitably will arrive at the school door — virtual or in person — at a disadvantage.


  The coming year will be pivotal for all students, but it will be especially important for those who struggled in the pre-pandemic world. They’re the ones who, in the best of times, face uphill battles. We worry an upturned education system where administrators are busy scrambling to react to constant change will mean the safety net upon which many students rely will have a few more holes than it did before.


  It seems inevitable — despite the best efforts of overwhelmed teachers and administrators — that more children will fall through the cracks now than before.


  That’s why we want to encourage our community to step toward a physically- distant school year with a watchful eye on those children who are in danger of falling behind.


  It will take a village to lift our most vulnerable students through this turbulent season.

  “This is a great yet somber day,” said Evers. “We humbly remember Cpl. Rochon’s brave sacrifice to our nation and offer our condolences to his family as they now find closure after so many years and lay Cpl. Rochon to rest eternally in his home state and community.”


  Rochon was a member of the 2nd Infantry Division. He was reported missing in action on Sept. 1, 1950, after fierce fighting near Changnyeong, South Korea. The Army officially declared Rochon deceased on Dec. 31, 1953, and declared his remains non-recoverable Jan. 16, 1956.

George Washington’s resignation as Commander in Chief emphasized the power of Congress, affirming that in this country there would be no king, and that power would reside with the people’s representatives. Lincoln, and Grant after him, endured enormous consequences for courageously fighting to implement a meaningful, inclusive and just Reconstruction of a cleaved union. FDR resisted pressures from both left and right to weld together a riven country, and in doing so, not only defeated fascism abroad, but also saved capitalism at home. Lyndon Johnson, a longtime segregationist, signed the Civil Rights Act, even as he acknowledged it would cost the Democratic Party the South.

  The field is set for the November general election and more than likely the races were decided on July 14. We had some good races, including the race for our junior U.S. Senate seat as well as two open congressional seats.


  Tommy Tuberville won an impressive 60-40 victory over Jeff Sessions in the GOP primary runoff for U.S. Senate. The tea leaves portend that the Republican Tuberville will defeat the Democrat Doug Jones by that same 60-40 margin. Tuberville will win for one reason. He is a solid Republican in a solidly Republican state.


  Winning the GOP nomination for a U.S. Senate seat, and for that matter any statewide office, is tantamount to election in Alabama. We are a very hardcore, safe, red Republican state, especially in a presidential year. It is also a very safe assumption to say that Donald Trump will carry Alabama in the presidential contest, and Trump's coattails should assure a Tuberville victory.


  The two open congressional seats in the 1st and 2nd districts are very safely Republican seats. Therefore, the winners Jerry Carl and Barry Moore can start packing for Washington, D.C.


  A not-so-subtle participation occurred in our GOP primaries in Alabama this year. Generally, Republican-leaning political action committees, like the Chamber of Commerce, stay out of party primaries and save their ammunition for the general election battle against Democrats. However, there is a giant that does not play by those rules. This giant is the Club for Growth - a right-wing PAC that promotes Republican candidates who adhere to a free market, free trade, anti-regulation agenda. They also believe and advocate for cutting income taxes and repealing the estate tax. Therefore, as you might guess, the money given to the Club for Growth comes from deep-pocketed, very wealthy, very conservative right-wing Americans. They dig deep into their pockets and write big checks primarily to Republican candidates.


  As a political observer, it is apparent to me that these Big Daddy Warbucks political wannabe players have more money than sense. Anybody with walking- around sense knows that anybody elected to a Republican U.S. Senate seat or Republican congressional seat in Alabama is going to be a conservative pro- business vote in Washington.


  Whichever candidate won the 1st District congressional race was going to vote the same. Yet the Club for Growth spent over $1 million on behalf of Jerry Carl's opponent. In the 2nd congressional runoff, the Club for Growth donated over $750,000 on behalf of Barry Moore against Jeff Coleman, either of whom would have voted conservatively or pro-business.


  In the U.S. Senate first primary race, the Club for Growth spent nearly $700,000 to keep Bradley Byrne out of the Senate runoff.


  This $2.7 million was spent in negative advertisements against their opponents, who again are fellow Republicans who are going to vote identically as the other. They gave their candidates another $300,000 for positive ads. That is $3 million in Alabama.


  My question to whoever runs the Club for Growth is, \"Do you not think that your money would be put to better use to help Republican U.S. Senate incumbents that are in close re-election contests in Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Montana, and North Carolina?\" These conservative Republican incumbents are trailing in the polls, as well as behind in fundraising. In short, whoever is calling the shots for the Club for Growth is essentially a political imbecile.


  If the Republicans lose the U.S. Senate, then the liberal Democrats will nail those rich idiots' hides to the wall, and they deserve it. However, Alabama does not deserve it nor can we afford it.


  If the Republicans lose the majority in the U.S. Senate, our crown jewel, Republican senior U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby, loses the chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Alabama loses all its power and influence in Washington. You will have a say in that. Currently, national pundits have the Democrat, Jones, losing in Alabama to the Republican, Tuberville.


  However, that is no guarantee. The national Democrats would love to use Jones as a Democratic vehicle to take control of the U.S. Senate and give the chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee to a liberal Democrat. Therefore, philosophy aside, economically a vote for Jones is a vote against Richard Shelby and the state of Alabama.

As part of the protocols in place due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Brewers and other Major League Baseball teams will conduct both their home and road broadcasts from their home ballparks. That means Uecker will be working Friday’s road game with the Cubs while staring at monitors from his booth at Miller Park.


  Safety precautions also will prevent Uecker and other broadcasters from chatting with players and coaches around the batting cage or in the locker room.


  “I can’t go in the clubhouse. It brings back such great memories of teams I was playing on telling me the same thing, but somehow I worked my way around it,” Uecker quipped.


  That sense of humor has helped make Uecker one of the most beloved figures in Wisconsin.


  Ever since April 2014, Miller Park has included a statue of Uecker in the back seats of the uppermost level behind home plate, an homage to the commercial from the 1980s in which he says, “I must be in the front row” as he gets ushered out of his seat.


  With no fans permitted in stadiums due to the coronavirus, the Brewers are selling fans cardboard cutouts of their likenesses that will be scattered next to the Uecker statue this season.


  “There’s no single person in this franchise’s history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,” said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers’ radio broadcast team since 2015. “To feel what a season would have been like without him is really difficult to fathom.”

SYDNEY, July 22 (Reuters) - Former Wallabies prop Pek Cowan had only one thought when the Western Force were included in the domestic Super Rugby AU competition - he was coming home to play for the only professional Australian side he had ever known.


  Cowan was a foundation member of the Force in 2006 and only left when the team was controversially dumped from Super Rugby in 2017. He has been playing in Japan since then.


  The novel coronavirus outbreak, however, forced rugby to shut down globally before Rugby Australia was able to organise their own domestic competition and invited the Force to join their existing four sides.


  Cowan jumped at the chance to add to his 130 caps for the Perth-based team.


  "As soon as I heard that we might have the opportunity to play Super Rugby again I thought there was no other team I would love to be a part of," Cowan told reporters on Wednesday.


  "There's a lot of emotion attached to a team that means a lot to me."


  The 34-year-old had to spend two weeks in quarantine and he acknowledged he was probably not quite ready to play on Saturday against the competition favourite ACT Brumbies.


  "I haven't been able to do a lot of the sessions just getting back but just watching the boys out there ... you can feel they want to do their best," he said.


  "That's something again that I'm really looking forward to being a part of."


  Playing in front of home fans in a few weeks, if travel restrictions allow for it, was also a spur for Cowan's return.


  "I know ... our supporters, the sea of blue, they're sitting there waiting for us to get home," he said.


  "For me, that would just be the ultimate for me to be able to chuck the jumper on and play there." (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)

July 22 (Reuters) - Leicester City's Jamie Vardy said scoring 100 Premier League goals was a massive achievement but its significance would hit home only after his retirement from the game.


  The 33-year-old, who netted his 100th Premier League goal in the 3-0 home victory over Crystal Palace earlier this month, became the first Leicester player to reach the milestone.


  He also became the 29th player to score a century in the English top flight, with his 103 Premier League goals coming in 210 games, after he debuted in the competition in the 2014-15 season at the age of 27.


  "It's a massive achievement but it's one of those, 'yes you've done it', but it's all about the next game then, so you don't really get time to have it sink in," the English striker told the club's website.


  "It's probably something that, when I finish football, I can look back on it and actually realise what it means.


  "The season finishes and you get away to forget about football for a few weeks and then you're straight back in to start the next season. So it's all about constantly going and going."


  Leicester host Manchester United in their final game of the season on Sunday which could determine whether they qualify for next season's Champions League.


  Vardy has fond memories of the fixture, having scored his maiden top-flight goal against United in a 5-3 home win in 2014.


  "It was massive. We'd just been promoted, all the world-class players they had and so for us to come away winners was really enjoyable," said Vardy, who has netted 23 goals this season.


  Leicester are fourth in the standings with 62 points, level on points with fifth-placed United, who have a game in hand. (Reporting by Arvind Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris and Christian Radnedge)

The trend for self-care has continued since lockdown, with people treating themselves to a good colour and cut now their beloved salons are opening again. And why should the Duchess of Cambridge be any different?


  Earlier this month, we revealed how Kate Middleton had lifted her usual brunette hair colour with stunning honey-toned highlights (and some '90s Rachel-esque layers thrown in for good measure).


  Kate has always kept things eu naturel in the hair department (and so would we, with glossy locks like that), so the colour overhaul came as quite a shock. But despite the new face-framing layers, Kate stuck to her iconic bouncy blow dry.


  If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?... wrong.


  Kensington Palace just released pictures of Kate meeting with representatives from organisations which will benefit from the Royal Foundation's £1.8 Million fund to support frontline workers and the nation's mental health.


  As well as being _super_ impressed by Kate and William's ongoing support for worthy causes, we couldn't help but notice how differently her newly-coloured hair was styled (give us a break, we're beauty journalists!)  


  As well as the usual bouncy blow dry, Kate's hair had a distinct beach wave throughout - a look created using either a curling tool or straighteners twisted around each strand. However she (or her stylist) achieved the look, the results were stunning.

HOMEWOOD, Ala. -- An Alabama police officer was suspended and demoted after he posted a video of himself rapping a song with controversial lyrics.


   


  Homewood police officer Jon Newland received a three-day suspension and was demoted from corporal to officer, news outlets reported Tuesday. Newland was also moved from the department's training division back to patrol.


   


  In the video posted on Newland's Instagram page, which has since been deactivated, the officer rapped, "I wear black and blue, professional gunslinger, rap singer too."


   


  At the end of the 55-second video, Newland sang "my ways are a blaze of mysterious smoke, around your neck I flex this choke."


   


  Newland posted the video in May, nine days before the death George Floyd, who was killed by Minneapolis police officer.


   


  Homewood police Sgt. John Carr said officials were made aware of the video June 18.


   


  Carr said Newland was not on duty when the video was posted nor was he "representing himself as a Homewood Police officer in any official capacity." Carr also said the lyrics were not a reflection of the department.


   


  Newland has since returned to work, AL.Com reported.


   


  It's unclear whether Newland will appeal the decision. Carr did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A lot of people might say that they'd give him the boot and be done with it and that's all well and good, but it wouldn't be that great for comedy since the whole point of the movie appears to be figuring out how to get rid of him, though it feels safe to assume that by the end the couple might come to grips with the fact that they're getting used to him and he might even come to realize he needs to grow up. But that's a pretty normal direction for any movie to take, so maybe something else will happen and surprise the heck out of everyone in the process. In any case, it's a way to see Pauley Shore being funny again, and while a lot of the sick humor might turn some people off it's bound to attract a good number of viewers that want something to laugh at for no better reason than because it's funny and they just want to smile. After all, considering everything that's happening in the world right now that's a big desire of a lot of folks that are faced with the day to day issues that never appear to stop. Right now comedies are a balm to a lot of folks that are tired of the constant negativity that continues to be a matter of routine in our daily lives, so a movie with toilet humor is going to be welcomed no matter how sick it gets. Well, there might be a limit, but we'll have to wait and see how bad it gets.

Clean the house, do the laundry, wash and dry the dishes, cook, mow the grass, go down to the farm, take care of/check up on the critters, work on a project or two, wash the windows, mow the grass again, go fishing, take a bike ride, go for a walk, get the mail, putter in the little garden and repeat, sometimes in no particular order. I am happy I manage to retrieve the mail each day since that way the bills get paid as they arrive. And yes, there’s a certain rhythm to the days but it’s not a rhythm that differentiates one day from another really. Television used to be a big help. Tuesdays were NCIS, Thursdays were The Big Bang Theory. Now new episodes of Big Bang ended last year so all we get are the inevitable reruns, and with no new weekly NCIS’s that marker too has disappeared. Much of what we watch is on each and every day and we don’t watch much so…. therein could lie a problem.


  But it’s not much of a problem unless I forget an appointment, which I have done (Wednesday? I was sure that was set for Thursday. Oooops).


  Even holidays got lost in the shuffle during this year of the unusual. Mother’s Day we took part in an impromptu parade for someone who had been hospitalized for several months with a driveby/horn honking spectacle. Our daughter was also there, so she handed me my Mother’s Day gifts from her and the kiddos through the truck window. Memorial Day found us at the cemetery placing floral arrangements on loved one’s gravesites, but there was no parade or other activities to attend so we just did the usual chores and tasks of the day when we were finished up there. I sent cards to all the graduates whether a party was imminent or not… We were baling hay on Father’s Day, but our daughter and her family did come out and help, thus she and her dad got to see each other. She got him some UV protective moisture wicking work shirts that come in handy for a guy who spends much of the day outdoors, regardless of temperature. (And some of the temps were mightily unpleasant.) Plus the grandkids gifted him with paintings of their own creation making that day special in a different than usual way. On the 4th of July, with no parade or activities to take in, it was again business as usual. We went fishing in the evening so for the first time in many years didn’t even attend the fireworks or light a sparkler in the yard. The rest of the summer will be the same. No Pioneer Days, no Flambeau Rama, no Price County Fair. Busy? Absolutely. Social? Not so much. I talk to people on the phone more than I have in ages, keep in touch with others via text or an occasional email. Chat with neighbors in the yard. Since the church I attend opened up again I’m more than happy to see my church family each week (and somehow can recall when Sunday comes). But in truth I don’t mind only visiting the grocery store once every three weeks, and the gas station as necessary. My secret is out. I’m a homebody. I have always been a homebody. I will always be a homebody. And it ain’t so bad my friends, it ain’t so bad at all.


  No matter where we are or what we do the days still go by. I just try to make the best of them. Hope you do too.

I think there is still a significant gender imbalance in the STEM fields. Particularly when it comes to leadership positions. Women make up half the world’s population, and yet only 6.6% of CEOs in the Fortune 500 companies are women, and only 24% of representatives in congress are women. Powerful leaders make decisions that affect multitudes. We need women equally represented in leadership circles so they can make changes in policies and perceptions that will enable women to achieve parity in business.

Next week, jazz drummer and producer Makaya McCraven will release a new album called _Universal Beings E &F Sides_. A companion piece to his widely acclaimed _Universal Beings_ record from 2018, this upcoming collection features 14 “new pieces of organic beat music” that were cut from those original studio sessions.


  Earlier this month brought lead single “Mak Attack”, which saw McCraven adroitly “attacking” his kit like the percussion virtuoso that he is. Today, the Chicago native returns with another rattling offering in “Beat Science”. As indicated by its title, here he experiments with a range of thumps and thuds, some wispy and casual, others pointed and moving at breakneck speed.

“I definitely want to compete again,” Wie West said. “That's so far down the road. It's not predictable at all. But I told Pat that I'm totally leaving it up to her. It's her decision. And if she wants me to play, I'll play. If she doesn't want me to play and only be an assistant, I'm fine either way."

“Normally, even in this environment, I wouldn't really think twice about going over and just saying ‘Hi,’ keeping your distance. I'd be even more careful now, because obviously you don't know what the fallout is from this,” Boone said. “So it is a reminder that these things can happen. Here it is, opening day, and one of the game’s best players, it happens to. It's another reminder that it's important to do all we can to keep ourselves safe.”

Graves finished the year with 67 games played before the stoppage occurred, contributing 9 goals and 17 assists while logging 18:57 time on ice per games played. The stat that stands out the most for him is his league-leading plus-40 rating, which shows how much of a positive influence he has when he is on the ice.

That is why its mandate has remained substantially unfulfilled. The dream that led to its creation has remained a delusion and the struggle to retain it has remained the business of the political elite who are benefitting from it. No one seems interested in doing a costs/benefits analysis, to ascertain the wisdom of retaining such a drainpipe that has no real value. It waddles about year after year, ostensibly 'developing' the oil producing states, whereas much of what it does in reality is pay staff salaries and ensure the sustenance of the frightening takings of a leadership elite from all over the federation that has held it hostage. So, to dare suggest that such a hapless cash cow that is being used by the elite to plunder the state in the name of the people be scrapped is to draw the ire of vested interests. That is why, despite the burgeoning scandal in the organisation today, scrapping it and having the monies going to the states is not one of the options on the cards. One can understand the objection that the states themselves are performing miserably on all fronts. But the advantage of scrapping the plethora of commissions will be the reduction of "thieving points" for the elite.

Stefan Berlin did not stop her. He shared another video of Toni soon after this one went viral, where Toni can be seen playing on the carpet. He captioned that video, _“Still haven’t properly unpacked the office/studio space so it’s kinda turned into a dumping ground ð «. Toni’s not really supposed to be in here but I feel she’s lowkey obsessed with the sensation of carpet under her paws? She’ll be big mad when it gets replaced with hardwood ð”. _

Our last advisory class of the year was built around being grateful. Students were each given a Kindness Matters postcard (printed by teacher Karl Bolton) to write a thank you note to someone who was near and dear to them and asked to give them out during lunch time. Watching students share these special postcards at lunch was quite impressive on many levels. Students were also given a skinny slip of paper to write a message of gratefulness to a teacher, friend, or parent that was to be turned in for our school mural.
