TALLAHASSEE -- Florida's top business regulator plans to start meeting with bar operators and craft brewers, amid concerns about establishments closing permanently if a state ban on serving drinks for on-site consumption remains in place.
   
 In a tweet Saturday, Department of Business and Professional Regulation Secretary Halsey Beshears said he will begin setting aside time Friday to discuss his June 26 order that banned on-site consumption at bars to try to help stem the spread of COVID-19.
   
 "Next week starting Friday, I'm going to set meetings throughout Florida with breweries and bars to discuss ideas on how to reopen," Beshears tweeted. "We will come up with a Safe, Smart and Step-by-step plan based on input, science and relative facts on how to reopen as soon as possible."
   
 Beshears has said the order, which is backed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, would remain in place until the growth in COVID-19 cases starts to decline. The state has become a hotspot for the epidemic, with DeSantis repeatedly pointing to young adults -- including those who might congregate in bars -- as one of the reasons for the surge in cases.
   
 Sunday the state reported an additional 9,344 cases, bringing the overall total to 423,855. The state added 73,808 cases during the one-week period from July 19 to Sunday, while 872 Florida residents died of the disease during the period, according to Department of Health numbers.
   
 DeSantis initially stopped bars and nightclubs from serving alcohol for on- site consumption as part of an emergency order on March 20 to try to help stop the spread of the virus. The order was lifted on June 5 in all but South Florida, which has been hit hardest by the pandemic. While bars were allowed to start serving drinks again, the state limited indoor customer occupancy to 50 percent and allowed only table service.
   
 But Beshears reimposed the ban on onsite consumption in the June 26 order because non-compliance with the safety guidelines in the bar industry was considered too widespread to enforce.

 Bar owners have complained, in part, that the order unfairly discriminates against them, as establishments that serve food in conjunction with alcohol are able to remain open. Beshears' order doesn't affect restaurants that derive less than half of their gross revenue from the sale of alcohol.
   
 On July 20, members of the craft brewing industry warned Beshears and DeSantis that the industry was in "jeopardy," as the number of breweries has already started to decrease and "it is our fear that this trend will rapidly accelerate."
   
 "The vast majority of over 320 small businesses, representing over 10,000 jobs, are existing solely on a 'to-go' model for our products -- this constitutes less than 10 percent of our collective sales and is an untenable model for our industry," a letter from the Florida Brewers Guild said.
   
 Some breweries have gotten food licenses, which has allowed them to remain open. But the letter contended the "vast majority" of breweries have been closed in 2020 for more days than they have been open.
   
 "As of the writing of this letter, our internal polling has revealed that we are likely to lose more than 100 breweries permanently if this continues for more than two weeks," the letter said. "Let us repeat that -- more than 100 breweries in two weeks -- and with that, nearly a third of the 10,000 jobs supported by our industry."
   
 Numerous bar owners have filed lawsuits against the state over the order.

An issue that was practically ditched but will come back to the fore when the European Parliament is asked to endorse the agreement centred over linking aid to the 'rule of law'. Hungary and Poland both threatened to veto the package if the EU adopted a policy of withholding funds from nations deemed to fall short of democratic principles. Many critics and many MEPs think that Brussels is showing weakness in the face of abuses of the rule of law and of European values by some Central European member states.

GAINESVILLE, Fla. - At least 17 anesthesiologist residents and a fellow at one of the premier university hospital systems in Florida contracted COVID-19 earlier this month after attending a private party together, according to hospital insiders and internal documents.
   
 The outbreak at University of Florida Health occurred after a party at a private home, according to people familiar with the situation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they said UF Health prohibits employees from speaking to reporters without authorization.
   
 After the party, on July 10, chairman of anesthesiology at the University of Florida College of Medicine, Timothy E. Morey, emailed staff to report that the hospital system's anesthesiology department had 18 positive cases of the coronavirus who were recovering at home.
   
 The cases included 14 junior residents, two senior residents, a fellow and an administrative employee, the email said, noting that it was providing the "latest data from yesterday." It said the anesthesiology department "wishes them well and a speedy return to good health." It was unclear whether or when the employees were returning to work with patients.
   
 The UF Health outbreak illustrates the difficulties of stemming the spread of the pandemic, when even trained health care professionals can be sickened from a private party in Florida - one of the nation's hot spots for the virus - after explicit warnings about the risks from social gatherings.
   
 A copy of Morey's email was obtained by Fresh Take Florida, a news service operated by the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications.
   
 In response to questions, UF Health's chief communications officer, Melanie Fridl Ross, said in a statement: "UF Health educates its faculty, staff and students on best practices to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 on and off- duty. Our goal is to minimize the spread of the illness on our campus and in our community, recognizing that it's impossible to prevent all cases given the way pandemics naturally work."
   
 UF Health operates the UF Health Shands family of hospitals, UF Health Jacksonville medical center and others. It includes the University of Florida colleges of dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health and health professions and veterinary medicine. Its hospitals and doctors manage more than 3 million inpatient and outpatient visits each year. The anesthesiology department has nearly 100 total residents, including 45 junior residents.
   
 In his email, Morey also reminded hospital employees not to come to work sick and to wash their hands frequently. The message did not mention a party or say anything about social gatherings, such as parties. Morey did not respond to emails and a voice message left at his office over days.
   
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned earlier this month that events and gatherings can spread the virus, and health officials around the U.S. have warned specifically that private parties are fueling the pandemic, especially among younger adults.
   
 Details about the house party were not immediately clear. One person described it as a going-away party for a resident, but another person described it as a party organized by second-year residents for incoming first-year residents, with roughly 20 or 30 residents who attended. The conflicting statements could not be resolved.
   
 The incident also raised questions about transparency in uncovering information about outbreaks among health care workers, even at a government- run health care system.
   
 The hospital system declined to confirm or dispute the outbreak or a party. In a prepared statement, and over days of communications with officials there, it said unspecified state and federal privacy laws prohibit it from commenting on specific situations. "Like any business, employees on occasion get sick," the statement from its communications office said.
   
 A national expert in health privacy, Bradley Malin, director of the Health Information Privacy Laboratory at Vanderbilt University, said public health authorities generally are permitted under federal law to confirm an outbreak among a select group of people as long as there are more than 11 people and fewer than 80 percent of the group who are infected. The principal law governing such disclosures is the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
   
 Another expert, Mark Rothstein, a professor who teaches in the law and medicine schools at the University of Louisville, agreed it would not violate the federal health privacy law to confirm an outbreak as long as hospitals don't identify employees by name and they can't be identified in other ways. He said it was common for health officials to blame the law "as the reason when individuals or entities do not want to disclose health information."
