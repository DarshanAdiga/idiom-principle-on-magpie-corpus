The team is currently in phase two, the red phase, where teams can practice with half the players at one time. It has split the team into two practice groups: outfielders on Mondays and Wednesday and infielders on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
 The team will stay in the red phase for two weeks then move into the yellow phase, where the entire team can practice together at one time. The final phase, the green phase, is a greenlight to do basically whatever the team was able to do before the pandemic.
 On top of all this, players have to track and record every place they travel to, on an online spreadsheet, whether it’s to the Fuller’s Market or Tacos El Rey. It helps the team track whether or not a player is at risk if there is an outbreak somewhere in the county. And if any player contracts COVID-19 during these phases, the team has to start all the way back at phase one.
 “The girls have been doing good,” coach Katie Aden said. “It seems like they’ve been keeping up with all the tasks that they need to do. I think the hardest thing for them is tracking.”
 Every practice starts with a temperature reading of each player and making sure they don’t have any COVID-19 symptoms. Masks are not required so long as players remain six feet apart.
 After the team finishes all its phases this fall, the team will head into winter break for a short reprieve. When they return, they start the phases all over again.
 The extensive catalog of guidelines has already taken a blow on the team. Five players have elected to opt out of the season, saying it was either too much hassle or they didn’t want to risk their health during the pandemic. It’s not an isolated incident eithert, Aden said. The baseball and soccer teams each lost about 10 players as well.
 “It’s definitely affected everybody in a big way,” Aden said.

Christmas is just around the corner and local organizations are already starting to tentatively prepare for future holiday events. Because of the virus, many of those events won't look exactly the same as they did in previous years.
   
 At the Kewanee Chamber of Commerce, Executive Director Mark Mikenas spent time this week tying up some loose ends.
   
 "We've already started doing some preliminary work for decorations on Main Street," he said.
   
 Mikenas said preparations are underway for the lighting of Northeast Park as well. The volunteers that help set up the drive-thru lighting event, are back on board. The park district has been notified and semi-trucks will be moved onto the park property next week so decorating can begin. The group hopes to take advantage of the warmer weather.
   
 Since the lighting display is drive-through, Mikenas said the group has no excuse not to carry on the tradition.
   
 "We knew we had to do it," he said. "With COVID-19, we don't have to worry about crowds."
   
 Mikenas said the decorations will be changed up this year and include several new displays. Because of the virus, the Kewanee Life Skills inmates, who usually build and paint decorations, haven't been able to help this year, but Mikenas said that won't stop the volunteers from mixing it up and providing some new items to the drive.
   
 As for Windmont, Mikenas said he hasn't heard from the Windmont lighting committee yet. The KCOC is in charge of organizing the Christmas Parade that kicks off the Windmont lighting and Mikenas said he has yet to address that event.
   
 Kewanee Parks and Recreation Director Brian Johnson said he believes the volunteers for the Windmont lighting event recently met, but he had yet to hear anything official as to whether the volunteers intend to light the park this year following the recent deaths of co-founders Bob Martin and Bob Neirynck.
   
 "My gut feeling is that it will happen," Johnson said of the Windmont Park lighting. "But I just can't say for sure."
   
 Mikenas also sent plans to the Henry County Office of Emergency Managment to hold the annual New Year's Eve Hardcore Run. The annual event is a 5-k run with the tagline, "run your ice off."
   
 "They will evaluate the plan and proposal and we will abide by what they say," said Mikenas, adding that he believes the event can be held safely even during a pandemic.
   
 No word has come from the schools or churches yet about the holding of annual holiday concerts and events, he said, although he sees no reason why the downtown open house, held on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, can't go on as planned.
   
 The annual Kewanee Salvation Army Christmas Concert will go on, just not as planned, said Director Eddie Toliver.
   
 The concert usually takes place during the middle of December and is held at the Baptist Church. However, this year, Tolvier said the concert will be pre- recorded in November at the church and posted on the Kewanee Salvation Army's Facebook page in December.
   
 The event will include some special guests and surprises, said Toliver.
   
 "We'll try to keep it lively."
   
 Visitation Catholic School will hold its 34th A Country Village Christmas Bazaar on Nov. 21, though the school gym won't be covered with booths from school supporters and other vendors offering craft items, holiday treats and other goodies, as they usually are during the holiday season event.
   
 But the highlight of the event, the raffle of donated prizes, will be conducted.
   
 People will be able to come to the gym to drop raffle tickets into buckets corresponding to the various prizes. Only 50 people will be allowed in the gym at a time. Their temperatures will be checked, and all who enter will be required to wear a mask.
   
 A limited menu will also be available for carryout only. Take and bake frozen pies will also be available for carryout.
   
 To order raffle tickets or make a donation to the bazaar, or for more information, contact Kali Nichols at knichols@visitationcatholic.com or Jen Hampton at jennifer.hampton@parkslivestock.com.

Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo will be back in the starting lineup on Sunday when the San Francisco 49ers face the Miami Dolphins.
 Garoppolo, who missed the past two games with a sprained right ankle, was a full practice participant on Friday and coach Kyle Shanahan was pleased with what he saw.
 "He did a good job. Each day got better," Shanahan said of the practices throughout the week. "Never felt too sore the next day, so we needed to hear that today and see him out there today. We feel good to go and he'll be starting Sunday."
 In six total quarters of playing time in 2020, Garoppolo has completed 33 of 49 passes for 390 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions. He was injured in the first half of the 49ers' Sept. 20 win over the New York Jets and hasn't played since.
 Nick Mullens started the past two games, but Shanahan said that C.J. Beathard will be No. 2 on the depth chart against Miami. Beathard relieved Mullens in the fourth quarter on Sunday and rallied the team against the Philadelphia Eagles, but San Francisco suffered a 25-20 loss.
 "Nick understands the situation and understands the business," Shanahan said. "He didn't have his best game. C.J. has been there before. Jimmy has been there before. Nick just had a rough game and I think he played better than it looked. It's never as bad as it seems. But that's kind of a life of a backup."
 The status of running back Raheem Mostert (knee) is still up in the air. He has missed the past two games and the team listed him as questionable to play against the Dolphins.
 "It's really just how he's feeling then," Shanahan said of Mostert testing the knee prior to Sunday's game. "He got a little bit more work today and he was able to get through it. We didn't put them through everything, but I really want to see how he responds tomorrow, how he wakes up tomorrow and how he feels on Sunday."
 The 49ers will get linebacker Dre Greenlaw (quadriceps) back after a two-game absence and safety Jimmie Ward (wrist) also was cleared to play.
 Ahkello Witherspoon (hamstring) is questionable while fellow cornerbacks Dontae Johnson (groin) and Emmanuel Moseley (concussion) have been ruled out.
 Receiver Deebo Samuel (illness) is also questionable. Samuel is away from the team and needs to pass two COVID-19 tests before he is allowed back in the team facility.
 San Francisco will add two players to the active roster over the weekend once it formally places defensive end Ezekiel Ansah (biceps) and cornerback K'Waun Williams (knee) on injured reserve.

 Stretching is one of the best things that we can do for our bodies. We can stretch when we first rise in the morning to awaken our bodies, midday to catch a second wind, and before and after any fitness regimen, all to prepare and loosen our muscles. It's quite simple; we feel better and it can cut down on injury.
 Stretching keeps our bodies limber and mobile, and in many instances, it's just what the doctor ordered!
 Our move today is a downward dog pose or stretch. This exercise is very popular in many yoga and Pilates formats, and is notably known to be beneficial for the whole body. You will simply need a flat surface for this stretch.
 The easiest way to begin this stretching motion is to start on all fours in a tabletop position. Place your hands firmly on the ground, with your arms extended just below your shoulders. Press your navel toward the ceiling to engage the midsection. Keeping your bent knees just under your hips, keep everything squared up.
 Once you feel sturdy, proceed to extend your legs up onto the balls of your feet, and slowly push back with the hips, getting a good extension in the legs. Focus on dropping the chest toward the floor and over exaggerate the stretch in the arms. Remember to keep your neck neutral the whole time you are in this downward dog position.
 Continue to press through the hips to get the maximum amount of stretching, not only in the hips but through the back of your legs into your calves and ankles. If you find that your muscles are somewhat tighter than normal, you can keep the knees slightly bent and continue to hold this position on your toes. The idea is to aim toward your feet being flat on the ground and the legs being in a straight position.
 Once you find the perfect position for your downward dog, try to hold this movement for at least a whole minute. If you cannot hold it that long, you'll have something to slowly work toward.
 After that minute you can release back down into your tabletop position for a small break, then proceed back into your downward dog position again. Try to get a deeper stretch and tone with each new hold.   You will find this stretch is perfect on its own for a complete body stretch. It also works well as a transitioning move in any yoga or Pilates workout.

dimension10': 'Elf on the Shelf',


--DocBreak--
There is a way global inequality dynamics cascade down into the political economy of the Nigerian state and society. By virtue of the colonial calculation and the postcolonial neoliberal capitalist hegemony, Nigeria, with the rest of Africa, has been drawn into the global capitalist system. And to function, capitalism requires elements of the global and national economies that are willing instrument in facilitating the imperatives of capital. On the global level, there are multinational organizations; and at the national level, there are the political, economic and the bureaucratic classes. One way or the other, we arrive at Marx’s clash of class status between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat all over again. In Nigeria, the political class—in cahoots with their bureaucratic collaborators—are arrayed against the helpless masses. And in this conflict, power becomes a very fundamental component. For Claude Ake, “Power is everything, and those who control the coercive resources use it freely to promote their interests.” This statement is reminiscent of Marx’s understanding of the state as coalition of the ruling class organized for its own interest.

It is in this regard that the idea of the common patrimony as a “national cake” becomes really graphic. At the feast of carving out portion of this sumptuous cake, the masses of Nigerians become stunned bystanders who are dazzled daily by the dizzying news of billions stolen from the national treasury, and the vulgar display of obscene wealth. And to make matters worse, the political-business-bureaucratic elites and their foreign business partners further weaken the national economy by facilitating capital flight either to Europe or to their private accounts and business ventures in foreign lands. Nigeria therefore becomes the cash cow milked progressively by class interest. No one will doubt therefore the level of inequality, in terms of wealth and income, that the Nigerian situation has generated. We have a situation in which less than 5% of the population owns more than 80% of Nigeria’s wealth in per capita terms. To use a contemporary political science terminology, we can say that to all intents and purposes, the elites have captured the Nigerian state.

SPRINGFIELD - A group of retirees organized through the senior advocacy group AARP held a virtual news conference Wednesday to express support for a graduated tax constitutional amendment and opposition to a tax on retirement income - two things that they note are mutually exclusive.
   
 Many of the speakers, which included a former state director of the Department on Aging, took direct aim at recent claims by opponents of the tax amendment. Illinois is one of 12 states that do not tax retirement income. Of those 12, nine do not levy income taxes at all.
   
 "The fair tax amendment would also protect our retirement income," Chicagoan Carmen Betances, a member of the Jane Addams Seniors in Action, said at the news conference. "Illinois is one of the few states that does not tax retirement income. The fair tax will not change that. In order to protect retirement income in Illinois, we need more revenue to keep us afloat."
   
 The "fair tax" is a name proponents, including Gov. JB Pritzker, have given to the graduated tax constitutional amendment proposal. That measure, which will appear on the Nov. 3 ballot, would amend the state's constitution to remove the requirement that any income tax be levied at a flat rate equally across all levels of income. If approved by voters, the amendment would allow lawmakers to impose different tax rates on varying levels of income.
   
 Should the amendment pass, a rate structure that has already been approved by lawmakers would take effect in January. It would scrap the current 4.95 percent flat tax, creating six tax brackets for varying levels of income ranging from 4.75 percent under $10,000 to 7.99 percent above $750,000 for single filers.
   
 Those earning more than $250,000 annually would see rates increased under the structure, while those earning less than that amount would pay slightly less or the same under the new tax system compared to the current flat tax structure.
   
 In estimates released prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Pritzker's office said it expects the approved graduated tax rate structure to bring in about $3.4 billion in state revenue once it is in place for a full fiscal year.
   
 Speakers at the news conference Wednesday said state government has ongoing budget deficits in the billions of dollars, especially as revenues plummet amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the graduated tax rates approved by lawmakers are one way to raise revenues without taxing middle income earners or retirement incomes.
   
 Pritzker has estimated the budget shortfall for the current fiscal year at $6.2 billion dollars. Without the graduated tax, which would only be in effect for half of the fiscal year, the shortfall could reach $7.4 billion, he said in April.
   
 "If Illinois doesn't find a way to fix this budget crisis with steps in the right direction, such as passing the graduated income tax, that's when state lawmakers may be forced to consider adding a retirement income tax or more drastic spending cuts," Charles Johnson, AARP Illinois volunteer and former Director of the Illinois Department on Aging, said at the news conference.
   
 Opponents of the amendment have seized on a June comment by Treasurer Michael Frerichs, a Democrat, who said at a local chamber of commerce event, "One thing a progressive tax would do is make clear you can have graduated rates when you are taxing retirement income…And, I think that's something that's worth discussion."
   
 Frerichs called a news conference this week to address the statement, but abruptly canceled it, instead issuing a release saying he is against taxing retirement income.
   
 While opponents have argued that allowing different tax rates on different levels of income would open the door for a future tax on high-dollar amount retirement incomes, the actual wording of the amendment does not create a retirement tax and does not make it any easier for the state to levy one.
   
 Pritzker said in a separate news conference Wednesday he was opposed to taxing retirement income.
   
 "I want to preserve the ban on retirement taxes, and I stand with all democrats opposed to raising retirement taxes," he said. "But the people who are opposed to the fair tax want to put the burden on people who can't afford it. I want to put the burden on the people who can most afford it. And that's our millionaires and billionaires in Illinois."
   
 Opponents, however, have argued that even the $3.4 billion from the graduated tax would not fill the state's budget holes, meaning further increases would be needed in the future and rates could be adjusted. Opponents argue more structural spending and pension reforms are needed before taxpayers are tapped for more revenue.
   
 The amendment does not change the simple majority vote threshold needed from lawmakers to raise taxes in Illinois, but opponents argue by allowing lawmakers to set tax rates for smaller sectors of the population at any one time, it makes it a politically easier move for future General Assemblies.
   
 On Sept. 24, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said lawmakers "will be forced to consider raising income taxes on all Illinois residents by at least 20 percent, regardless of their level of income" if the graduated income tax fails. That would push the current tax rate to about 6 percent.
   
 The Illinois Republican party quickly issued a statement following those remarks, calling them a "scare tactic" that will not sway Illinois voters.
   
 A coalition led by the Illinois Chamber of Commerce, the Illinois Farm Bureau and National Federation of Independent Business has been growing in opposition to the amendment since the beginning of the year, and on Wednesday they announced 40 new members opposing the tax, including 27 local chambers of commerce.
   
 The approved rates also raise the corporate tax rate from 7 to 7.99 percent, and the Vote No on the Progressive Tax Constitutional Amendment coalition argues that, amid the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic restrictions, now is not the time to raise corporate taxes.
   
 "Like the rest of small businesses, our auto dealers are struggling to recover from major losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic," Illinois Automobile Dealers Association Director of Government Affairs Joe McMahon said in a news release. "Now is the worst possible time to increase taxes on our businesses that are fighting to keep their doors open and their teams employed."
   
 Proponents, however, point out that small businesses earning less than $250,000 per year will see taxes lowered if they are pass-through entities such as S-corporations or sole proprietorships.
   
 The graduated income tax will need support from 60 percent of those voting on the ballot question or a majority vote of the total votes casts in the election in order to pass.

Some 38 first graders are set to return to Ormondale Elementary School on Monday, Oct. 12.
 The San Mateo County Office of Education gave the Portola Valley School District approval on Thursday, Oct. 8, to resume in-person classes amid the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a district email to parents.
 The district, which serves over 700 students across Ormondale (transitional kindergarten to third grade) and Corte Madera (grades 4-8) schools, is taking a phased approach for reopening.
 Kindergarteners and transitional kindergarteners will return the week of Oct. 19, while second and fourth will begin on-campus instruction on Nov. 2. Third and fifth graders will follow, starting on-campus instruction on Nov. 9.
 The district's hybrid learning model means students will do some learning in person and some at home.
 Thirteen first graders will continue with full-time distance learning, said Superintendent Roberta Zarea in an email.
 The county moved out of the most restrictive purple or "widespread" risk tier to the red or "substantial" tier on Sept. 22. Since the county has stayed in the red tier for two weeks as of Oct. 6, all TK-12 schools in San Mateo County are allowed to reopen, so long as they develop a reopening plan, have a testing plan in place for staff, and use an incremental approach to reopening, according to the San Mateo County Office of Education website.
 The Portola Valley district joins the neighboring Menlo Park City School District, which reopened for in-person kindergarten and first grade instruction on Sept. 28.
 The district announced at a July 24 board meeting that it would start the fall semester, which began Aug. 21, fully online.
 Notably, the district teachers union, Portola Valley Teachers Association, submitted a letter to the board July 25 which strongly expressed that it did not want teachers and students to return to campus during the pandemic.
 The teachers union could not be immediately reached for comment on the reopening plan.

Stretching is one of the best things that we can do for our bodies. We can stretch when we first rise in the morning to awaken our bodies, midday to catch a second wind, and before and after any fitness regimen, all to prepare and loosen our muscles. It's quite simple; we feel better and it can cut down on injury.      Stretching keeps our bodies limber and mobile, and in many instances, it's just what the doctor ordered!      Our move today is a downward dog pose or stretch. This exercise is very popular in many yoga and Pilates formats, and is notably known to be beneficial for the whole body. You will simply need a flat surface for this stretch.      The easiest way to begin this stretching motion is to start on all fours in a tabletop position. Place your hands firmly on the ground, with your arms extended just below your shoulders. Press your navel toward the ceiling to engage the midsection. Keeping your bent knees just under your hips, keep everything squared up.      Once you feel sturdy, proceed to extend your legs up onto the balls of your feet, and slowly push back with the hips, getting a good extension in the legs. Focus on dropping the chest toward the floor and over exaggerate the stretch in the arms. Remember to keep your neck neutral the whole time you are in this downward dog position.      Continue to press through the hips to get the maximum amount of stretching, not only in the hips but through the back of your legs into your calves and ankles. If you find that your muscles are somewhat tighter than normal, you can keep the knees slightly bent and continue to hold this position on your toes. The idea is to aim toward your feet being flat on the ground and the legs being in a straight position.      Once you find the perfect position for your downward dog, try to hold this movement for at least a whole minute. If you cannot hold it that long, you'll have something to slowly work toward.      After that minute you can release back down into your tabletop position for a small break, then proceed back into your downward dog position again. Try to get a deeper stretch and tone with each new hold.   You will find this stretch is perfect on its own for a complete body stretch. It also works well as a transitioning move in any yoga or Pilates workout.

Howe’s speech captured that mood. He spoke, writes Moore, “with great care, and with dry wit, but also with contained passion.” His words “drew gasps as his point hit home.” The speech makes fascinating reading today, because so much of it concerned Britain’s relationship to Europe, and because it reflects a liberal internationalist worldview that has now vanished from the Conservative Party. Though the details of the policies he was discussing mean little now, at base Howe was talking about attitudes. Thatcher, he said, looked at Europe as “a continent that is positively teeming with ill- intentioned people.” Instead of seeking cooperation and mutual benefit, she kept leading Britain into “isolation.” As a result, she was “running increasingly serious risks for the future of our nation.” He ended by declaring that it was time “for others to consider their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties with which I myself wrestled for perhaps too long.” Although this sentence was ambiguous, his fellow members of parliament immediately understood it as a call to challenge her for the leadership of the party. In retrospect, it also sounds like the first warning bell of the Brexit debate that was to unfold a quarter-century later.

The red planet is big and bright and casting its glow all night long this week. It is just in time for the fall foliage season most of us in the United States and elsewhere in the north are experiencing.      But what would you call the color of Mars?      It's not really "red," but it certainly reflects sunlight in the red end of the spectrum. This may depend somewhat on your eyes and sky conditions, but, to me, it appears more of a golden red-orange to the naked eye.      Mars is currently in one of its closer approaches to the Earth, which you should appreciate while you can. Mars circles the sun about every two Earth years but varies considerably with how near it approaches.      Mars was at its closest point to the Earth on Oct. 6, and will be at opposition with the sun on Oct. 13. That means Mars is directly opposite from the sun in the sky, rising as the sun sets and setting when the sun rises.      In even a small telescope magnifying about 50x to 100x, you can detect Mars as a disc, although it is quite tiny. Still, it is an amazing sight in the eyepiece even if it is so small. You can see the small disc of Mars, likely with faint stars in the background (unless you have a lot of light pollution). Imagine you are in a spacecraft nearing Mars.      If your telescope can handle higher magnifications, and the seeing is good (steady air), you should be able to glimpse dark smudges on the disc and a very small and very white south polar cap.      The "smudges" are referred to as maria, and are fairly permanent markings that you may have seen in photographs. The maria are named and charted on Mars maps. You can even purchase Mars globes, which make for an interesting conversation piece.      The dark features are areas of higher contrast, caused by either darker, basaltic rock or simply where less Martian dust has settled.      The color of Mars in the telescope is striking. The vast Martian deserts are not quite red, perhaps red-orange. To me, it is close to the shade of a peach, more so than a cherry or red apple. Either way, Mars is amazing.      The color is caused by iron oxide chemicals in the dusty soil which resembles rust.      Along with Mars, the colors of autumn can be found in several bright stars visible to the unaided eye and thousands more you can see with a small telescope and a good star map to lead the way.      Perception of color among the stars by our eyes is limited to brighter stars simply because of the way our eyes are structured, at night or in dim light our eyes are less sensitive to color.      The telescope amplifies the brightness, so many more stars are visible that become bright enough to show their shade.      Among red stars, there are red supergiants and red dwarfs. The dwarf stars are very abundant, and none bright enough to see without a telescope.      A couple of wonderful, bright red stars are Antares, well seen on a summer evening, and Betelgeuse, which is most well known as part of Orion, prominent on winter evenings.      Then there is bright yellow-orange Arcturus and bright yellow Capella. You can see these two on opposite sides of the sky as darkness falls in October. Arcturus is in the west, and Capella low in the northwest.      Many more stars are white, or bluish-white.      Early on an October evening, the brilliant star Vega shines with a blue-white light high up in the west; you can also see the bright white stars Deneb and Altair in the west-southwest, and bright white Fomalhaut low in the southeast.      Of course with Mars, we have the planets Jupiter - very bright - and Saturn, a little less bright and to the left, down in the southern sky.      The other morning, I ventured forth onto the deck at around 6 a.m. just in time to make some cats scatter. Looking up, I was delighted to see the very brilliant planet Venus, high in the east, and Mars, which by this time was low in the west. In the southern sky, I had a foretaste of winter but without's winter's cold: there was the wonderful constellation Orion, with the bright red star Betelgeuse, white star Rigel and, to the lower-left the brightest star of the night sky, blue-white Sirius.      The waning gibbous moon was nearly overhead.      Enjoy the colors of the night.      The moon is now a waning crescent, visible in the east after midnight. New moon is on Oct. 16.   Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.

Kupers acknowledges that large-scale clemency is politically risky and commends the Obama administration for introducing a policy that could have backfired easily. "Clemency is a dangerous political endeavor. For years, starting with Reagan, commutations have been very few and far between. Pardons are less risky because you've got somebody who's been out for 5 years and has demonstrated they can live without committing new crimes so it doesn't take a whole lot of courage. A commutation could lead to a Willie Horton scenario." Obama commuted the sentences of more than 1,700 federal inmates, a record number, though he waited until the final years of his second term to do so.
