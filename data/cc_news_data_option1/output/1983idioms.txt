If comedians fear anything, it's silence. You bust a gut to make a joke in front of tens or hundreds of people, only for it to be met with indifference. But COVID-19 has forced all of the live venues closed, making acts take their shows online or risk losing their audiences. With online-only comedy, silence isn't just an occupational hazard, it's the default. I'm in an improv troupe called the Intellectual Hooligans, and we've been wrestling with not gigging while the UK's lockdown order persists. Every couple of months, as well as our regular run of smaller gigs, we sell out 200- and- 300-seater rooms, with the profit going to local charities. Or, at least, we used to. Initially, we tried to keep going by recording little challenges in the style of the TV show Taskmaster while stuck indoors. But, since everyone's still there, we decided to start doing our gigs online, which is the general trend right now.We had a couple of private practice sessions to work out what games -- like those played on Whose Line is it Anyway? -- worked in this new format. And when we had enough to fill a show, we started doing them on Friday nights. The biggest burden of taking any performance online, however, is the absence of an audience, so crucial for all comics. Being in front of people is vital to the act, helping you establish a rhythm, keeping you on your toes and helping you find your funny. It's why even the glitziest of stand-up specials with veteran comics are shot in packed auditoriums. Not even someone as venerated as Jerry Seinfeld wants to do a routine to silence. Running the gigs is more involved than just turning up to Facebook and clicking a button, though. One of the team is a drama teacher and maintains her classes during lockdown with her own Zoom Pro subscription. She streams the feed of our call, via OBS, to Facebook Live, on Friday nights at 8pm. We opted not to have a "live" audience on the stream, as much as we wanted them to be involved and laughing, because it complicated matters. The stream regularly dies (thanks, Facebook) and publishing new room links may have been an open invite for Zoombombers. "Telling jokes with nobody just looks like hostage footage." Michael Che SNL's first Weekend Update (At Home) actually tried adding a small audience on Colin Jost and Michael Che's 'Zoom' call. But the muted, sporadic laughter seemed to undermine the performances, and the experiment wasn't repeated in subsequent episodes. Others have found a way to make this live- audience format work, like Stuart Goldsmith's Infinite Sofa. The podcast star and standup's live variety show invites audience members on to the live Zoom. And, rather than them being audible wallpaper, Goldsmith works the crowd, involving them in the action between interviews with celebrity guests.Performing without an audience means that you can't pick up what they're responding to and adapt accordingly. Sometimes, a live gig will have a stag or hen party that'll go crazy for dick jokes and the more scatological. Other nights, high-brow jokes resonate as loudly as detailed character pieces and anti-comedy. On your own, however, you're left trusting your own judgment a lot more. Streaming also means that there's a momentum-sapping delay between anything you do and the audience's reaction. When you're waiting for people to chime in with suggestions, or in a game like tag lines -- where people write lines you perform -- it's a struggle. And it reduces the number of games you can play in a 90-minute show as you manage the delays. And, while I'm complaining, it doesn't help that improv is a physical medium with a huge emphasis on "object work," a fancy term for mime. Online, with narrow webcams pointed at your faces and a grid of other performers on a screen, it's difficult to do the subtle visual acting you do in a room. It's also hard to make eye contact with your scene partners (a key tool to communicate without the audience noticing) when you're in close-up on camera, too. For all of the gripes, however, there are little rays of sunshine that make the experience a little more validating. The smallest gig we do, or did, on a regular basis was in the top room of a coffee shop where you'd struggle to get 25 people in. Already, the livestreams are clocking double that, pushing us close to some of the paid gigs we do -- did -- each month. And the most rewarding part is watching the suggestions and comments pouring in as we're performing. It's so wonderful to establish that connection with your audience, no matter how far away you are from each other. We'd wondered if anyone would even bother tuning in given the number of competing entertainment options available during lockdown. That, ultimately, makes the logistical hurdles worth overcoming, and the longer these shelter-in-place orders remain, the more vital it becomes for live arts to go online. Because it's not likely that theaters -- those that survive, at least -- will be packed full of willing audiences until long after a vaccine has been developed.

Daltrey: We pay for that space in the hospital. We equip it. We maintain it. And we provide specialist nursing. That's what we do. And you have to remember that a lot of these youngsters who get cancer don't live near a big city. They might be miles out in the sticks. So we are starting outreach programs where we send specialized nursing, setting up web links so that they can link patients up.

India always reforms during a crisis and I am confident that we will get some good reforms from this government, says Ajay Singh. You are allowed to fly again albeit with one-third capacity, airfares being capped and also 7 buckets being put in place depending on the duration of the flights. What is your initial reaction? We are just grateful that we can start to fly. Whatever the conditions are, it was really important that Indian airlines be allowed to fly again because we were just sitting around suffering all the fixed costs and not being able to fly. So I think it is wonderful that we are able to fly and we are grateful to the civil aviation ministry because they have really fought hard for us; there is no question about it. There were so many sceptics. People said that it is unsafe to fly in the aircraft cabins. There were completely ill-informed opinions which said that because air circulates and it is a confined space, it can be dangerous. Fact is aircraft cabins are probably the safest amongst all public transport cabins in the world. So the air actually circulates from the top to the bottom. There are HEPA filters which clean the air. So it is a very clean cabin. So we are grateful that the civil aviation ministry was able to make that case. Also on the issue of leaving that middle seat empty, I think the ministry did understand our point that leaving that middle seat empty serves no health purpose whatsoever. I said this to you in an interview a long time ago that the difference between the distance between the window and aisle seat is 17 inches and it does not fulfil any social distancing norms. But we are grateful to the ministry that they were able to convince the health ministry that indeed was the case and that there are other precautions that need to be taken like face masks and face shields. So we are just happy to fly. We will deal with the complexity. The cap on airfares is done by the government for larger public interest. I do not know if you have the fare chart and if you can share with us. The aviation minister during the press conference told us that for the Delhi-Mumbai route, Rs 3,500 is the price for the lower band and Rs 10,000 for the upper band; 40% has to be saved for the lower band. What does this mean for the airline and the consumers? How are you going to calculate all of this? Will you release the lower band tickets before the upper band tickets? How is it going to work? These are the decisions that will be taken by the commercial teams but let me tell you that airlines are used to a lot of complexity. We live in a very regulated environment in terms of ticket fares. We pretty much chase them every minute. So our commercial teams are well- versed with handling this kind of complexity and they will take their own calls. The government wants the fares to remain in a band for a period of time and we will achieve that. We do understand that there would be some political compulsions and the government would try and ensure that when there is peak demand that might actually exist for a period of time, there should not be the perception that somehow airlines are taking advantage of consumers. So we understand why they are doing it. Are we thrilled about it? Absolutely not. We think perhaps we should have been able to get what the market is willing to pay but we understand their compulsions and we are just grateful that we can start operations, whatever the conditions may be. Given that the fares are going to be capped, you are going to be flying at one-third capacity. If passengers can only carry one piece of luggage, there is going to be no extra luggage to charge for, there is going to be no food that you can charge for on board. Are you going to lose more money now till August 24 or do you think you would have lost more during the lockdown? With the fares that have been set and with the oil prices being where they are today, we do not really believe that we will lose money. We will probably make some money. Now is that going to be enough to pay for the 70% of the fleet which is sitting on the ground at this time? Probably not. But whatever we do now is going to help that and we are completely sure about it. Today when airfares are being capped, do you think it is a missed opportunity? Do you think they must have also carried out some reforms or measures to bring down cost structure, whether it is the airport charges, ATF or other kinds of levies that are put on the carriers as they stay constant? Yes, certainly there is a significant opportunity for reform here and I do not think this is a lost opportunity. It has not passed. I think the government will continue to work on reforms. They have been pretty proactive. We have been discussing with them and as you know, they did take out the throughput charge which was a charge for no service at all on carriers for so many years. We are discussing with them several other initiatives that can be taken including the inclusion of ATF under GST and this is a work in progress. India always reforms in crisis and in this crisis we will get some good reforms from this government and our ministry is extremely proactive in this process. How are you going to decide which routes to operate? With one- third capacity, everybody will want to make a go for the most lucrative routes even though there is a price cap. Will we finally see some kind of domestic code-sharing between Indian airlines? How do you see this evolve because the idea is also to improve air connectivity at a time when families have been separated for two months because of the lockdown? These issues of sharing resources and code sharing will come later. Right now it is important to get started. And as far as selection of routes is concerned, what the government has made clear is that we have to fly 33% of our approved summer schedules and that is easy. We can just take one-third of the flights that we were supposed to fly in summer. Obviously, we had chosen those flights on the basis of profitability and hopefully they remain profitable. If we need to make some changes as time passes, we will approach the government but at this time, we will try to find the most profitable routes that we can and fly those within the rules that the government has set. Right now it is about essential travel and people will want to just reunite with their families. They are not going to go for summer holidays and that is a big problem because all the travel that has to take place will happen maybe in the first couple of days or weeks. Then you are staring at the prospect of maybe flights being completely empty because there will be a fear psychosis? We will cross that bridge when we come to it. From the queries that we are getting on our websites, we do not really believe that to be the case. In fact we have been surprised at the number of queries we are receiving at this time for vacations. I think people are so fed up with being cooked inside their homes that they desperately need to go for a holiday. And amongst the largest queries we are getting is for holiday destinations. So apart from the absolutely critical emergency travel you are talking about, I think we all might be a little surprised at the resilience of consumer demand in India. While it has fallen off across the world and while it might pick up slowly in India, we still might be surprised at the pace at which it picks up. Remember that capacities have been constrained to 33%; so even if demand falls off by 67%, we are still looking at flying with the same kind of yields and the same kind of loads that we were doing pre-Covid. Any message that you have? My message is only this. This is as safe as a plane can be and as safe as any public transport can be. There is no question that when you fly on a SpiceJet aircraft, you will be flying in the safest possible public transport cabin anywhere in the world. Our planes have the latest possible technology. We have leather seats which can be cleaned easily and the chances of contracting infection on our planes is far less than they probably are if you stay in your own home. So, please do come out, please do fly, travel and please do start living life again and start to do business all over again. Just take all the precautions that you can but please start living life again.

Die Mitglieder des Ortsrates Westerbeck haben am Mittwoch bewiesen, dass sie nach Jahren des politischen und persönlichen Schlagabtauschs auch harmonisch können. So zeugten fast alle Beschlüsse von einer gemeinsamen Marschrichtung. Andreas Kautzsch (BIG Sassenburg) hatte sich in Fleißarbeit die Flecken im Dorfkern vorgenommen, die aktuell nicht mit einem Bebauungsplan bedacht sind. Damit hier nicht jeder bauen könne, wie er wolle, beantragte er, einen B-Plan mit örtlicher Bauvorschrift aufzustellen und eine Veränderungssperre zu beschließen. Rainer Knop (SPD) tat sich anfangs schwer, wollte erst einen Planer beauftragen, der sich gleich das ganze Dorf vornimmt. Letzteres mache, schon im Hinblick auf die Haushaltslage, keinen Sinn, beschied Bürgermeisterin Annette Merz (CDU). Und Waldemar Bartels (CDU) hielt es für wichtig, „heute unsere politische Absicht“ zu bekunden. Ein Kompromiss war am Ende die Lösung: Erst Aufstellung und Veränderungssperre, dann Planer.

Majority of high-ranking business managers confirm that corporate revenues have already declined by over 25 per cent during the lockdown and businesses will take more than a year to return to normalcy, according to a survey. The survey titled 'Covid-19 and Your Wealth', conducted by online investment provider Scripbox, reveals the impact of the lockdown on company revenues and job losses. Nearly 67 per cent of top bosses, business owners and founders surveyed said that company revenues have already declined by more than 25 per cent during the lockdown. Further, all respondents believe that business will return to normal only by 2021, while 22 per cent business leaders expect it to take more than a year, from when the lockdown ends. The online survey was conducted with Scripbox customers during May 1-15, 2020. Nearly 1,200 respondents consisting of business leaders took part in the survey. Of these, 54 per cent work in large corporates, 32 per cent in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and 14 per cent in startups. The survey noted that downward spiral in business revenues was accompanied by job losses. 90 per cent respondents have witnessed less than 25 per cent job reductions, while the remaining 10 percent have seen more than a 25 per cent job cuts at their company. The negative impact on jobs is the highest among employees of small and medium businesses, the survey noted. According to the survey, freelancers have been the worst-affected by the lockdown as 66 per cent of them reported more than a 25 per cent reduction in their revenues, out of which 35 per cent said that their revenues have dried up altogether. The old adage of 'Saving for a Rainy Day', could not be more true than in the COVID-19 era. The advice we give to all our customers is to start early and stay invested for the long term and to let the power of compounding help them to grow their wealth, said Atul Shinghal, Founder and CEO of Scripbox. The current situation with the stock markets and wealth management in general, will be short-lived, as the markets recover in the medium term. These are short-term fluctuations, lows will be followed by highs, he added.

Lawmakers must draw up a spending plan by June 30 for the 2020 budget year that begins July 1. They will do so next month amid a level of uncertainty unseen since the 1930s. Predicting how much tax revenue will be collected amid the economic plunge from the COVID-19 pandemic is beyond challenging, although Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has pledged to make a new guess by early June. The federal government could bail out state governments, as it did for a while during the Great Recession, but Republicans in the U.S. Senate are currently stalling House Democrats' push for state aid, meaning Georgia may have to plan for the worst.
