Of these 19 were positive, refused or failed breath tests. A total of 37 drug wipes were also taken and of these, four were positive.


  A total of 48 venues across Peterborough and Cambridgeshire signed up to support the campaign last month by taking part in the ‘I’m DES’ scheme - triple the number of venues compared to last year and one of the highest recorded numbers in recent years.


  The initiative, led by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Road Safety Partnership (CPRSP), aims to reduce the number of road traffic collisions caused by drink driving over the festive period.


  PC Morris said: “Thank you to the high number of venues who supported the I’m DES scheme this time round and everyone who called our drink and drug drive hotline, which can be called in confidence at any time of day or night to report those driving under the influence.”

The Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) changed the over half century traditional deer season opening day from the Monday after Thanksgiving to the Saturday prior amidst strong opposition. To someone not familiar with the dynamics of this weekend, this change might seem innocuous, but that would be a poor analogy. Economic losses were identified from 10 business contacted exceeding $360,000.00, statewide impacts are likely in the several millions. Opposition to this change came from 65% of our hunters who were surveyed by the PGC. 81% of approximately 1300 hunters who contacted the agency opposed the change. Even the agency staff itself who was tasked to research the PGC commissioners' reasons for making this change came back with data that did not validate their thought process. Opposition of this magnitude toward any issue should be concerning, particularly when the decision-making body, The PGC board, is required to educate themselves with this information as a primary source in their decision making.


   


  Why did the majority of hunters oppose the Saturday opener and why the economic losses? The Thanksgiving holiday complicated the new Saturday opener. Thanksgiving condensed countless hunter preparations and traditions previously done throughout the weekend following the holiday, into only one day- the Friday after Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is the most traveled holiday of the year identified by AAA and TSA, this made it difficult if not impossible for many hunters to clear their schedules due to visiting family members or related scenarios. Taking away 2/3 of the pre-opener time in this weekend, upset many hunters in many ways, especially those that hunt from camps, seasonal homes and non-resident hunters. These hunters travel for hours to open and warm their camps and have dozens of pre-hunt preparations to complete before daylight the next morning. The travelling hunters recognized the Saturday opener as a bigger problem, but the overall research evidence and hunter outcry identified statewide negativity. For over half a century hunters anticipated this labor of love steeped in tradition. Lee Dechant, owner of Route 66 Sporting Goods, Shippenville Pa., may have said it best referring to the PGC board: "What a mess they made of this!"


   


  The Saturday opener was unfolding like a bad dream for many hunters, and ended up a nightmare for rural businesses. Putting Thanksgiving to bed and just having enough time to get ready for a pre-daylight Saturday hunt, eliminated long standing traditions and hunt preparation, but also took the hunter patronage out of countless Pennsylvania stores that weekend, almost completely! The Saturday opener reduced an over half-century raging stream of hunter dollars to a trickle in dozens of counties and thousands of businesses. In many northern rural areas, this weekend sales surge from hunters would be the last big sales weekend before the dead months in winter. Dollars made here were stretched until spring when trout season brings sportsman back into these areas. A good indicator of this circumstance was evident in the feedback from sporting goods stores that specialized in hunting supplies, license sales and firearms. The owners of 10 sporting goods stores from throughout the state indicated their sales loss numbers were stunning, some were already in the process of writing letters to the PGC! These 10 businesses ranged in size from very large to medium to mom and pop variety. They all identified losses directly attributed to the Saturday opener totaling in excess of $360,000! With only these 10 stores racking up these kinds of losses, one can only imagine the overall impact to all types of small businesses that hunters previously patronized this weekend. These 10 owners stated many neighboring businesses they spoke with also experienced losses never before seen in this weekend. Their claims were all validated with historical sales analysis of this weekend. They also identified Saturday opener opposition from their hunting customers was running as high as 90% .


   


  The data shows most hunters do not like the Saturday opener. The PGC commissioners were actually recalled to Harrisburg last spring to reconsider their vote by The House Game & Fisheries Chairmen Keith Gillespie and Bill Kortz, in response to hunter opposition. This PGC board was given ample reason and chance yet they refused. Now we have a severe economic impact hurting many small businesses, combined with the hunting related woes. When small businesses identify they depended on the sales from the opener weekend to carry them through winter months, and now questioning how to pay their utility bills again this is not an innocuous situation. When some even stated possibly closing their doors over this, it is time for someone to look at the facts and guide this ship of PGC hypothetical reasoning back to the port of reality and accountability! Several legislators have already expressed their opposition to the Saturday opener, and we need other legislators to push for the return to the traditional Monday opener of the deer season.

Reached by ABC News, Hyde decline to comment on the messages. But when asked if he was offering to harm the ambassador, he said, "absolutely not."      Larry Robbins, a lawyer for Yovanovitch, called the allegations "disturbing" in a statement and that the ambassador hopes the "appropriate authorities" will investigate. Ukrainian officials have said they are investigating.      Several witnesses have testified that the president ordered a hold on $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine, despite clearance from the Pentagon and State Department. And when asked about U.S. aid in general on a July phone call, Trump asked Ukraine's president for a "favor" and called for an investigation into Biden.      Still unclear though is whether Trump directed his top aides to continue withholding the aid - money needed to fend off Russian aggression at Ukraine's borders - until it announced the probe naming Biden.      The White House has said Parnas isn't a credible witness and shouldn't be taken seriously. His media interviews though beg the question of whether the Senate should demand more evidence to understand what happened, before making the fateful decision of whether to remove the president from office.      Parnas said there was no doubt the president and his top aides orchestrated the pressure campaign to extract a political favor.      "President Trump knew exactly what was going on" with his activities in Ukraine, Parnas told MSNBC's Maddow.      Copyright (C) 2020, ABC Audio. All rights reserved.

Today, close to half of Africa’s inhabitants are children. Fueled by steady growth in births and declining mortality rates, the continent’s population aged under 18 will rise 50 per cent by mid-century, topping 1 billion. As the 22nd century dawns, there will be more children in Africa than anywhere else in the world. This expansive growth will bring about great change across the continent, and a great need to ensure each and every child is supported to achieve their full potential. There will be new challenges and opportunities for families and communities, and for African governments and their health, education and legal systems. African states must prepare to meet the needs of their growing young population, and commit to urgent, concrete actions to protect and promote the rights of all children – now and in future generations.

It's undeniable that this will change Chapman's young career, which is what makes his initial reaction to auditioning all the more amusing. "I just genuinely didn't have the time," he says with a slight laugh, recalling how he initially dismissed the opportunity. "[My agents] kept asking me to self-tape for it and I kept saying, 'No, fuck it! It can't I'm up to my eyeballs with, like, words and scripts and characters!" He was on set in Ireland for _Here Are All the Young Men_ , an independent film due out later this year, but, as luck would have it, two months later when he'd wrapped production, Mendes and co. were still searching for the right fit for Lance Corporal Blake.


  "Literally all I knew was the character name," he says of how he went into his first read. "I knew that Sam Mendes was directing. I knew that it was called _1917_ --that was literally all I knew." He didn't know much more even when he accepted the part. "Even the second audition, they didn't send me the full script," he recalls. "[What they sent me] was like four or five pages long."


  Chapman was, then, as surprised as audiences have been to learn Blake's fate: After he and Schofield cross a haunting No Man's Land, survive a harrowing walk through German bunkers, and begin their journey through enemy territory, a plane is shot out of the sky, crashing near their current location. It's not one of their own, and as the flames tear through the pilot's fatigues, Schofield suggests they put him out of his misery. They can't, Blake begs; _go get water_ , he yells. Before Schofield can fetch a bucket, the airman's knife has already inflicted its mortal wound on Chapman's storyline.

When "Bad Boys," the cop-buddy film directed by Hollywood bad boy Michael Bay, and starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, was released 25 years ago, it took in just over $141 million at the box office. When "Bad Boys II," with the same directing-acting combo came out 17 years ago, ticket sales were $273 million. I didn't see either of those films until a week ago, when I sat down for a double feature on my living room couch.      And I liked them! A lot!! It was easy to see why they were such big hits. Both featured boatloads of action, breakneck editing, gobs of handleable violence, a steady thread of humor, snappy banter, a lush and richly saturated color scheme, and a believable and loving camaraderie between the two leads.      Over the years, I had also become - with the exception of his dizzyingly unwatchable "Transformers" films - an unabashed fan of Michael Bay. When I discovered he wasn't directing "Bad Boys for Life," and that it would be co- directed by the unfamiliar (to me) Adil El Arbi and Bilail Fallah, I had some negative thoughts.      But 10 minutes into it, and already caught up by all of the action, fast editing, violence, humor, camaraderie, etc., I knew I was in good hands. About 20 minutes later, when Michael Bay had a cameo as a wedding emcee, and I realized he had given the film his blessing (and later found out he produced it), I was settled in for the ride.      In fact, it opens with a ride - a wild one, with Mike Lowrey (Smith) at the wheel of his Porsche, zigzagging through a high-speed police chase in Miami, with his partner Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) in the passenger seat, screaming for him to slow down. But it turns out not to be a chase. It's a high-speed ride to a hospital, where Marcus' daughter is giving birth to his first grandson.      And so begins the story of what appears to be the dissolution of the partnership. Mike and Marcus have been together all these years, but now Marcus is considering retirement "because family is all that matters." To which Mike, with no thoughts of retirement, replies, "I'll be running down criminals till I'm 100!"      Meanwhile, somewhere in Mexico, there's a bloody jailbreak, a reunion of a vindictive mother and her murderous son, and a vengeful plan that includes making Mike the target of some bullets. With that plotline in play, it's safe to say that retirement is at least temporarily put on the backburner.      There's some dark, serious stuff going on here, but the writers and directors make sure to include a fair share of fun in the mix, and there's some funny crosscutting between action-man Mike still keeping up his old lifestyle and old-fashioned family man Marcus settling into his new one. To clarify, Mike wants revenge on those who tried to off him, and Marcus wants to enjoy life with his grandson.      Joe Pantoliano returns for his third portrayal of the overly excitable Captain Howard, a man who regularly needs a swig of Pepto Bismol whenever Mike goes rogue on him. Series newcomers Paola Nuñez, as the head of a special police team, and Kate del Castillo and Jacob Scipio, as the malevolent mother-son duo, are perfectly cast. But as with the first two entries, it's the onscreen relationship between Smith and Lawrence, the peanut butter and jelly of cop- buddy movies (that's a compliment), that makes the film work.      Their characters are similar in that they're committed to their jobs. They're different because ... well, Mike drives that Porsche, and Marcus drives his wife's Nissan Quest. The nice thing about them playing these action roles again after all this time is that they're convincing as a couple of guys who are too long in the tooth to do it, but can still do it. Will there be a "Bad Boys 4?" The script makes it feasible, but let's see how well this one does at the box office (my guess is very well).      Ed Symkus writes about movies for More Content Now.

A travel vlogger from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Khalid Al Ameri, is the latest traveller to fall "in love with Pakistan and its incredible people", as he claimed in a new video shared on social media.  


  Swept away by Pakistan's beauty, Al Ameri's video shows him touring Islamabad, visiting shopping malls, interacting with people, and enjoying tea at a _chai dhaba_ (roadside cafe).


  Showing his massive fan following the country's hidden beauty, the vlogger said: "One of the greatest lessons I have learned from this trip is don't always believe what the media tells you about a country or a community.


  "Visit for yourself, see for yourself and more often than not you will be surprised by the kindness, beauty and hospitality you will experience," he tells his more than two million Facebook fans and almost 850,000 Instagram followers in a video titled 'The Truth About Pakistan'.


  -- _See the video at the end of this story!_


  Al Ameri explained how his perspective about Pakistan took a 180-degree turn soon after he landed.


  In the video filmed by internet sensation, he can be seen wandering around the federal capital and getting enchanted by the scenic landscapes, the rich culture, and the warmth of the people who welcomed him to the country with open arms.  


  "The people and the country are incredible mashAllah," he said.  


  "When I told people I was coming to Islamabad in Pakistan, everyone had their perception of what this city was going to look like. But I can tell you one thing. Their perception is completely different from the reality that I saw today," he said.


  In fact, he was awed at how a small tea stall owner refused to take money from him because he was Pakistan's 'guest'.


  "I have been inspired by the people I've met that have built this city into what it is today. That want to represent a Pakistan of tomorrow. And that, is what makes this country, and its people, truly, truly special," he added.


  Ending the video, Al Ameri uttered a chirpy "Shukriya Pakistan!"


  The vlogger also met President Dr Arif Alvi and took a picture with him that he shared on his Instagram.

Leonardo DiCaprio might have just dumped his girlfriend Camila Morrone secretly!  


  According to a source spilling details to _Radar Online,_ Leonardo - who is known to break things off with his girlfriends before anything gets serious - is reportedly pushing Camila away.


  "Leo loves being with Camila, but he's been getting so much pressure to put a ring on it, he's ready to hit the bricks," a source told the outlet.


  It looks like much of pressure is coming from Leo's mom, Irmelin Indenbirken, who wants her son to marry Camila.


  "Irmelin wants grandkids, and she'd like to be able to enjoy them in her golden years. She's telling Leo to get a move on and marry Camila," the insider claimed.


  It also went on to add that Leo does things in his life the way he wants.


  "Leo's a bachelor through and through. He wants to do what he wants to do, and when he starts feeling cornered, that's his cue to end it," it said.


  It has been reportedly said that Leo tried to snub Camila at the pre-Golden Globes party, where he sat at a corner of table chatting with his friends.


  "Leo sat at a corner table chatting with Armie Hammer and another pal, drinking and smoking," the insider said, adding, "He refused to cut his evening short when Camila felt sick and wanted to go home."

The last thing we need is something else to concentrate on other than the road.


  Distracted driving is a thing — and it is a dangerous thing — whether you are 16 or 65 and whether you are on a road or a highway.


  Add in speed, poor weather conditions and the risk you take anyway when you are traveling and you have a recipe for senseless loss of life.

It was emotional, he agrees, but not in that he suddenly identified with the brutal soldier experience, of now or of those who served in the Great War. Rather, it was the opposite. In wearing the wet, dank wool costumes, tripping through mud, and struggling to see through fog, he says he was humbled by just how easy he actually has it. "You'd get all of these little reality checks," he explains, "seeing that this is nothing compared to what the men went through. We get to take the costumes off at the end of the day. They didn't."  


  Audiences and critics have also, though for different reasons, been consumed with the WWI epic, which is based on a combination of true stories. The mission Blake, alongside Lance Corporal Schofield (George McKay), are tasked with is shocking: an Allied battalion is about to walk into a German trap several miles ahead and they must be warned before dawn otherwise they all, including Blake's brother, will be killed. With communications down, the two soldiers must travel by foot to deliver the orders in person and save 1,600 lives. And it gets a proper, and unique, treatment from director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins ( _Skyfall_ , _No Country for Old Men_ ). The entire 117 minutes feels like one continuous shot; the audience's perspective never strays from the heroes who lead them across enemy territory.

 Topeka police on Wednesday were crediting several Good Samaritans for helping prevent a man from jumping off a bridge that spanned Interstate 470 on the city's south side.
 The incident was reported around 9:55 a.m. on a bridge in the 3900 block of S.W. Martin Drive.
 Topeka police Lt. Manny Munoz said a man who had threatened to hurt himself had one of his legs over the bridge railing when several individuals \"intervened\" and held the individual.
 Officers who responded to the scene were able to take the man into custody. The man then was transported by American Medical Response ambulance to a local hospital to be treated for minor injuries and to be evaluated, Munoz said.
 The Kansas Highway Patrol was notified and also responded to the scene. Traffic on I-470 was shut down for a brief period in the area of the bridge while officers responded to the incident.

The singer, who has spoken about her struggles with an eating disorder, self-mutilation, drugs and alcohol, celebrated six years of sobriety in March 2018. But she relapsed, revealing the news in the song “Sober,” released in June 2018. A week before the Super Bowl, Lovato will perform at the 2020 Grammy Awards on Jan. 26.

Sky Sports pundit and former Arsenal and England midfielder Paul Merson thinks Klopp could turn the Millers into a top-flight team.


  "I'm a great lover of Klopp," Merson said. "I could use any team here, but I'm just going to say Rotherham... I think Klopp could go to Rotherham and take them to the Premier League in time. He's that good."


  But Warne has other ideas as the manager of a club who have never played higher than the second tier.


  "I think the German coaching badges are a lot better than the English ones," he joked.


  Warne experienced relegation from the Championship last season with a squad in which the highest-paid player was on £5,500 a week.


  "Jurgen is a lot more experienced than me," Warne said. "I can understand Paul Merson's comments because Klopp at the moment is head and shoulders above.


  "But if he got us to the Premier League, wow. I hope my chairman hasn't read that.


  "I'm not sure he could bring Mane and Firmino here, though. I don't think the wage structure will work."


  Rotherham are top of League One on goal difference as they bid to make an immediate return to the Championship.


  And Warne, who originally took charge as caretaker manager in December 2016, has already masterminded one League One promotion at the New York Stadium.


  Would those sort of credentials help the 46-year-old if he was put in charge at Anfield?


  "I'm not sure if I could win the Champions League. I haven't been involved in many Champions League games, so my experience isn't really up there," he said.


  "I reckon I might be able to win the Premier League with Liverpool this year - if I took over now I would give myself a good chance.

You may have heard about the legendary bags games involving reporters Bob LeGere and Larry Mayer, who always played on the same team. LeGere was sort of the Steph Curry of TJ Donlins (the local bar) as he had a knack for draining shots on the fly without any kind of roll. It was pretty common to see LeGere dunk two or three bags in a row, take a sip of his Rolling Rock and then curse as Mayer missed the board completely with his next two shots.

The applicants are said to be already behind bars in the UK or have been deported and are seeking to return.


  The Government has vowed to stop dangerous EU criminals coming into the UK by ending freedom of movement - something Leave campaigners had long argued was one of the reasons why Brexit was needed.


  The Home Office criteria is seen to be a bid to protect the public and prevent a repeat of cases like that of Latvian Arnis Zalkans - who murdered his wife before moving to the UK in 2007 and going on to kill 14-year-old Alice Gross seven years later.


  Slovakian Eduard Peticky was jailed for eight years in 1988 for raping two women in a park then travelled to the UK in 2008 and settled in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.


  In 2015, he was convicted of a series of sexual offences including trafficking and engaging in sexual activity with a child.


  Pro-EU campaigners reiterated concerns that the figures indicated rising numbers of EU citizens being granted temporary rather than permanent leave to remain - claiming some were eligible for settled status.


  The Home Office said pre-settled status was typically granted to people who have lived in the country for five years and insisted applicants had been first offered the chance to prove they qualified for settled status.


  In October, Security Minister Brandon Lewis indicated EU citizens could be deported if they did not apply by the December 2020 deadline.

Off the paven path, the Ascent and its 8.7 inches of ground clearance handles off-road terrain in a manner befitting Subaru. The X-mode button will make the brake torque vectoring more sensitive and reactive up and down hill, but it also applies to slippery conditions on pavement. High approach and departure angles enable getting over ruts and fording washed out roads. With seven passengers in the Ascent, we climbed up and down a Colorado mining road in the foothills of the Rockies. It was not a rugged off-road trail, but it was a rutted dirt path pocked with the kind of potholes that would kill a car in cities. The Ascent shrugged it off, proving that it has more off-road chops than some of those crossover SUVs that just look the part. Excellent outward vision means that climbing up or down a hill doesn’t come with climbing in and out of the Ascent to check angles.

In light of Mr. Marcum’s observation, it is hardly surprising that Tesla is aggressively turning to China in order to open up fresh avenues of growth. As an illustration, the company brought its Shanghai Gigafactory online within a record 357 days from January 2019 when the facility’s construction commenced. By localizing the production of the Model 3 sedans at the Shanghai Gigafactory, Tesla will be able to avoid a 15 percent tariff that has been imposed by China on all cars imported from the U.S and incur additional cost savings through the incorporation of domestic Chinese components into its EVs. This, in turn, will allow the electric car-maker to remain competitive in the world’s largest EV market amid an onslaught of new competition.

"Having this genetic biomarker, we can now very easily test any individual for the presence of the mutation," he said. "Having that ability can potentially save lives."


  Knowing who has the mutation and who doesn't is the first step to preventing tragedies like the ones experienced by the families in the study, Ackerman said. If adults who are carriers for the mutation know that they have it, they can make informed decisions about whether or not they should marry another person who is also a carrier.


  There are still challenges ahead. For children who have inherited the mutation and are at risk of sudden death, the only solution to prevent it is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), which can be extremely expensive. Ackerman said his team is working on understanding more about what causes the duplication in the gene so that a medication to prevent it can be developed, a treatment that would be much more accessible.


  "We're going fast and furious to try to get this figured out for this Amish community," he said.


  But for now, Ackerman hopes the discovery will provide some closure to the families who have lost their loved ones.

Development is good. Really?

When Adele’s songwriting collaborator Paul Epworth listened to 13 consecutive Bond themes to write the song for 2012 movie Skyfall, he noticed that they all had a major ninth as the “harmonic code”.

Each year hunters and anglers wait with anticipation for hunting seasons to open and the ice to clear the lakes for fishing. People from across the country dream of timing the waterfowl migration just right or hooking into a trophy walleye in one of the state’s many lakes.


  The small towns also wait with anticipation for the hunters and anglers to show up and spend their money at the grocery stores, gas stations, bars and coffee shops. Much of our tourism is based on our outdoor fame as a hunting and fishing destination.


  Outdoor recreation is also a mainstay of our state’s rural economy. One only needs to drive through small town Dakota and see the signs welcoming outdoor enthusiasts to know how much these activities are valued. We often hear our elected officials extol the virtues of hunting and fishing as one of the primary factors keeping our small towns from dying, but outdoor recreation also plays a significant role in quality of life for many, and is why many people, myself included, choose to live here.


  The Game and Fish Department reports that hunting and fishing in the state contributes a huge annual input to our state’s economy. When those dollars are added to the many other related outdoor pursuits, that’s a lot of money spent on main streets in towns and cities across the state.


  Unfortunately, outdoor opportunities in the state are diminishing for the regular hunter or angler. The critical factor that ensures sustainable populations and successful hunting seasons from year to year is adequate habitat for each species and public access for hunters and anglers. Insufficient habitat conditions mean reduced populations resulting in limited or poor hunting opportunities. The habitat for many of our favorite game species has been declining for several years. Ask any pheasant hunter and they will tell you that we have significantly fewer acres in the Conservation Reserve Program. Changes in cropping patterns have also reduced traditional, available habitats. Urban sprawl encroaches on areas formerly available as habitat. To make matters worse, there are fewer federal and state dollars available for use in maintaining and establishing habitat. Lost habitat and lack of access from industrialization, land use intensification, urbanization, and minimal support of programs that maintain and expand the economic values doesn’t just hurt the hunter’s bag limit, it results in diminished rural revenue.


  Successful hunting and fishing trips depend on habitat and access. If the game is not there, there is no fish in the lake, or if the access is restricted, people won’t go. Hunters and anglers, and the leaders of our communities must step up to ensure that habitat and access are available. Otherwise hunters and anglers are going to stay home — or worse, trade in their hunting and fishing gear for golf clubs.


  That’s why it’s critical to show support for the Game and Fish Department’s PLOTS (Private Lands Open to Sportsmen), optimum management of our public lands, and strong conservation provisions in the Farm Bill. These programs are critical to the Dakotaa. Our states’ leadership also needs to strongly advocate for programs that keep existing habitat on the land, and that promote establishment of new habitat in support of our hunting traditions. Quality habitat and public access drives our outdoor economy. Supporting those conservation programs that provide habitat and access for our citizens, support our local businesses, our farmers, and our ranchers makes good economic sense for North Dakota.

The expiration of applicable EV tax credits may be one of the most crucial factors responsible for the massive plunge in the Tesla registration numbers for the fourth quarter. Bear in mind that the current U.S. tax rules allow taxpayers a credit of $7,500 which, in turn, suppresses the overall acquisition cost of an EV. The credit, however, begins to decline once an automaker reaches cumulative EV sales of 200,000 – Tesla reached this threshold in July 2018 – and is completely eliminated within 15 months of hitting the stipulated cumulative sales figure. Accordingly, a tax credit of $3,750 was available upon purchase of Tesla’s EVs at the beginning of 2019 but the facility had halved to $1,875 by July. Currently, the credit is no longer available for fresh purchases of Tesla’s offerings which, in turn, makes the company’s vehicles substantially more expensive for new buyers.

Thousands of people visited picnic spots across Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts on Thursday to celebrate ‘Kari Naal,’ the day after ‘Pongal.’


  Since flow of water in waterfalls at Courtallam was very thin, tourists avoided the destination this time. Instead, all irrigation tanks situated along the Chittar watercourse, which are brimming with water and adjoining farms, attracted huge crowd.


  Over 1,000 visitors, after getting permission from the Forest Department, went to the Manimuthar Falls where they took refreshing bath, Forester Murugesan said. It was a great disappointment for the visitors as the recently-launched solar-powered boat was not operated in the Manimuthar Dam due to a technical snag. “It will take one more week to rectify the issue, it seems, as we’re waiting for the arrival of technicians from the supplier company,” he said.


  The Agasthiyar Falls and the Sorimuthu Ayyanar Temple at Papanasam also received good crowd. The Nambi Temple at Thirukkurunkudi, ‘Thalaiyanai’ near Kalakkadu and Vadakku Pachchaiyar Dam attracted huge crowd while hundreds of visitors camped at Gadana, Ramanadhi, Karuppanadhi, Gundar and Adavinaniar Dams.


  The police made elaborate security arrangements in all places where the public camped to leisurely spend the day with their families, friends and relatives. All water bodies along the Tamirabharani watercourse and rain-fed tanks have good storage thanks to the active monsoon and the police kept watch on people who had come to these places. Apart from the policemen from the local police station, a good number of policemen from the Armed Reserve Police were deployed in these areas.


  In Thoothukudi district, Hare Island, New Harbour Beach, Pearl City Beach on North Beach Road, Ammanpuram Spring, Kattabomman Fort at Paanchaalankurichi, Roach Park, Rajaji Park and farms close to the Tamirabharani watercourse were overflowing with visitors on Thursday.

Each of the 7000-or-so Swiss communes is aware that it will pick up the tab from this fund for aliens who cannot pay, so, to protect their own indigent, are swift to check that foreign residents are insured or can otherwise fund their health care - and have a generally stern attitude towards any immigrants who cannot meet this requirement.

_Aaliyah_ dropped on July 7, 2001, boasting what the artists proudly felt was a more mature neo-soul sound than the albums she had put out as a teen. It sold 187,000 copies in its first week, Aaliyah's biggest week of her career, but then sales started to taper off.


  Less than two months later, Aaliyah was dead.


  She had been in the Bahamas shooting scenes for her music video for "Rock the Boat" when on the night of Aug. 25, 2001, she warily boarded a twin-engine Cessna 402-B to be flown back to Florida from the Abaco Islands' Marsh Harbor Airport.


  "Down to the last BlackBerry [exchange] that we had, before she went there, she was like, 'I don't like that plane,'" Damon Dash, who was dating her at the time and later said he had planned on marrying her, recalled on  _The Real_ in 2016. "And I was like, 'don't get on it.' And she was just like, 'I gotta do it.' You know, it was a complicated situation but she had to go do that video."


  The plane, which investigators would determine was carrying as much as 700 more pounds than it should have been, crashed and burned just a few hundred feet from the runway after takeoff.

These projects must have looked like hits on paper. How to tell the difference? Traditionally, Hollywood almost prides itself on its own unpredictability, accepting as a given William Goldman’s adage “no one knows anything”. It is an industry that carries out extensive analysis, research and audience testing, but that still relies to a large extent on human intuition and gut instinct.

The high-end Galaxy Watch earned pretty great reviews when it was released around a year and a half ago, which made Samsung's next two moves in the Apple-dominated market very surprising. Instead of a Galaxy Watch 2, we got a budget-friendly Galaxy Watch Active in February 2019 and a slightly pricier Watch Active 2 roughly six months later.


   


  While the latter model certainly proved to be a serious Apple Watch contender in terms of health and wellness functionality, its design and raw power were still not what many hardcore Samsung fans expected from a sequel to the original Galaxy Watch. You may not want to give up all hope of seeing a premium Samsung Galaxy Watch 2 released sometime soon, though, as the folks over at GalaxyClub (translated) can "confirm the existence" of an unannounced wearable device that might be just that.


   


  Unfortunately, all we have to report right now about this mysterious gadget is its model number and battery capacity. The former hints at a clear family relation to both the OG Galaxy Watch and the still-fresh Watch Active 2.


   


  If history is any indication, the SM-R840 will designate the larger version of this upcoming smartwatch, following in the footsteps of the SM-R800, aka 46mm Galaxy Watch, and SM-R820, aka 44mm Galaxy Watch Active 2. The 42 and 40mm Galaxy Watch and Watch Active 2 models respectively also go by the SM-R810 and SM-R830 labels, strongly suggesting a smaller SM-R850 variant of the SM-R840 is in the works too.


   


  Of course, this could always end up as a third edition of the fitness-centric Galaxy Watch Active, a theory seemingly supported by the 330mAh battery size rumored today. If this turns out to be accurate, it would put the SM-R840 on largely equal ground as the 44mm Watch Active 2, but well below the 46mm Galaxy Watch, which packs a significantly larger 472mAh cell.


   


  Whatever this device is, it's unlikely to go official alongside the Galaxy S20 smartphone lineup and Galaxy Buds+ next month simply because we know far too little about it.

With the end of fall hunting seasons and significant snow on the ground, many sportsmen are looking to cure an itchy index finger that can’t be satisfied with the snap of an ice rod. Luckily, throughout the northern plains, plentiful opportunities for coyote hunting exist through the cold weather months, and never before has there been so many chances to not only engage in the pursuit of predators, but also to do so successfully. With developments in hunter technologies such as digital calling systems, advanced range finders, scopes tailored to predator hunting and even thermal imaging options, sportsmen can get the edge on these wily canids all winter long.


  The popularity of coyote hunting has been on the rise over the past two decades, and according to Jamie Olson, webmaster of coyotehunter.net and professional furbearer hunter and trapper, it's easier than ever to get into the sport, thanks to a boom of information and advancements in the last 20 years.


  The biggest impact in Olson’s mind is the development of electronic calling systems for hunters to use in the field which require the simple flick of a switch to help call coyotes into shooting range.


  “When I first started calling it was with an open reed ... you have to put some time into that to know how to make the individual sounds in order to actually call a coyote towards you,” Olson states, “with the better quality e-callers that have come out not only do they have great sound – Primos, FOXPRO, ICOtec – they’re good quality units and there’s just a large array of sounds, so you don’t have to worry about trying to mimic it with an open reed call, now you just pick the sound that you want to use and hit the button and off you go,” he concludes, referencing the abundance of tutorials online and in digital videos found on e-caller manufacturer’s sites and those such as YouTube, which maximize the effectiveness of electronic calling systems.


  Optics and scopes developed specifically for predator hunting and the growing long-range shooting trend have also been a boon to those sportsmen pursuing coyotes in recent years. Olson cites the development of advanced reticles, rangefinders and even thermal technology as being highly advantageous for the hunter that wants to get into the field and find faster success. Rifles with bullet drop compensators (BDC) help for shooting over a distance and can be tailored to a specific model, caliber and cartridge and the ballistics involved with the combination. With modern wind meters and range finders, sportsmen can hone their optics and ballistics prior to the hunt so they can focus on their quarry and interact with them at the distances required for a good shot. Even more advanced options are making their way into the mainstream as thermal imaging systems and scopes become commonplace among furbearer hunters.


  “The biggest thing right now that I’m seeing, especially in the more populated areas east of the Mississippi, is thermal,” Olson relates to the expanding technology which enhances night hunting opportunities, “it’s a game changer in a lot of areas but those coyotes are going to get smart to that too and eventually that’s going to have diminishing returns, but right now that’s the new thing people are gravitating towards,” he adds, cautioning that coyotes still remain one of the sharpest animals on the landscape.


  The basics remain the same for coyote hunting despite all the technological advances, including playing the wind, scouting terrain and using advantageous setups to get in position to call in these wily animals.


  It’s the thrill of overcoming their sharp senses of sight, scent and hearing that keep Olson and many other predator hunters coming back season-after- season for coyotes.


  “Coyotes will learn immediately from a bad experience, so if you go into an area and you called in a coyote and you make a mistake - be it he sees you, smells you, or you missed – that coyote is going to learn from that negative experience very quickly; it’s a very dynamic animal…it makes you a better hunter overall,” he states conclusively, adding that no amount of technology will fully compensate for the instinct of a seasoned coyote in the field.

The government may increase customs duty on several products like paper, footwear, rubber items and toys in the forthcoming Budget with a view to promote 'Make in India' and boost manufacturing growth, sources said.


  The commerce and industry ministry in its budget recommendations to the finance ministry has proposed rationalisation of basic customs or import duty on over 300 items from different sectors, including furniture, chemicals, rubber, coated paper and paper boards, they said.


  For new pneumatic tyres of rubber, it has proposed to hike customs duty to 40 percent from the current 10-15 percent. Similarly, on footwear and related products, the ministry has suggested increase in duty to 35 percent from the current 25 percent.


  "There is a significant increase in imports of undervalued and cheap footwear. Hike in the duty will help address the issue of price competition. Majority of imports are coming from ASEAN countries, with which India has a free trade agreement. It is also suspected that China is re-routing large quantities of footwear through these countries," the sources said.


  The ministry has proposed to increase import duty on wooden furniture to 30 percent from the current 20 percent. For coated paper, paper boards and hand made papers, it has suggested doubling the duty to 20 percent.


  However, it has asked for the removal of import duty on waste paper and wood pulp, which is currently at 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively. The paper industry has expressed concerns about cheap imports and a surge in inbound shipments.


  "This has a significant negative impact on coated paper manufacturing industry. Increase in duty will help the domestic industry to compete with global players. It would also protect local manufacturers and ensure sustained growth of the domestic paper industry," one of the sources said.


  For wood, metal and plastic toys, the ministry has suggested increase in import duty to up to 100 percent from the current 20 percent. Import of these toys increased to $304 million in 2018-19 from $281.82 million in 2017-18 from China and Hong Kong.

We hadn't had the new microwave that long when, all of a sudden, it decided it just didn't want to microwave anymore.      "You had one job," I said to the microwave, chastising it after it failed to reheat some leftovers. "Is that really so hard?"      Naturally, I had no idea what went into making a microwave microwave. I assumed it probably had something to do with the sun, since it used microwaves, and maybe also radio waves or ultraviolet rays, and therefore there was surely a solar panel installed somewhere, that made it work, as well as a transistor radio and sunscreen. Since I had no experience with microwaves or radio waves or UV waves (except that one time when I was seven and I got a really bad sunburn), I thought this was all well out of my limited range of appliance repair knowledge and decided to call in a professional.      I looked online for a repairman in my area and chose Mike's Microwave repair because it had a number of good reviews and also, Mike and Microwave both begin with an M and I like alliteration. I had to wait two weeks for Mike to show up because apparently, there was a sudden epidemic of microwave deaths at the same time that mine pooped out. It was like some kind of microwave flu that must have been transmitted over the airwaves, or maybe the radio waves, I couldn't be certain.      By the time Mike finally arrived I was beside myself. I was a child of the microwave generation and never realized that food could also be reheated in an actual oven, so for two weeks I ate cold leftovers and brooded about how difficult life was without a microwave.      "I think it might be the fuse," said Mike when he finally arrived and did triage on my microwave. "It should be an easy fix, but there's a chance I might have to do open oven surgery. I need you to sign a release."      "A release?" I said. "For what?"      "Acknowledging that the appliance was not functioning when I arrived and nothing I did caused it to further malfunction."      "Fine," I said and signed the form. "But before you do anything, you should try pointing the satellite dish in a different direction to see if that solves the problem, because not only is the microwave broken, but also, our TV isn't getting very good reception."      He looked at me like I was one burner short of stovetop. "They have nothing to do with each other."      "What?" I said.      "Your microwave and your TV," he said. "Completely unrelated."      "Got it," I said. "But could you check the TV when you're done with the microwave, anyway?"      "I only do kitchen appliances," he said.      "But the TV is in the kitchen," I replied. Then I recalled that the ad said, Mike's Microwaves, and not Mike's Microwaves and TVs, so I decided to let it go.      I watched the one TV channel that worked well while Mike did surgery on the microwave. But when I decided to switch channels, all of a sudden, at the exact same time, the microwave whirred to life.      "Hah!" I yelled. "I fixed the microwave!"      "No, you didn't," said Mike. "I did. I put in a new fuse."      "I'm not so sure, Mike." I said assuredly. "I was on CNN and when I switched to HGTV, the microwave started to work again."      "I told you, they're not related," he argued.      I shrugged. "If you want to believe that, that's fine," I said. "I don't want to make waves."

The demand for dry van container in Europe is expected to increase at a significant pace in the coming years on the back of increasing trade activities in the region. With recovery of the EU economy, European markets have shifted their focus towards adoption of new carriers. With respect to freight logistics, Germany is expected to largely contribute to the growth of the dry van container market in Europe, it being ranked first in terms of logistics performance according to World Bank analysis. Moreover, limited trade regulations have favored seaborne trade among Europe and emerging economies in Asia Pacific and Africa. This aspect has actively pushed the growth in sales and demand for dry van container in Europe.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau regretted in the fall that "divisiveness and disinformation were all too present features of this past election campaign," in which he acknowledged he had become a polarizing figure.


  What the Liberal party leader didn't quite admit, however, is he played an oversized role in turning the October 2019 election, in which his party was reduced to a minority, into a toxic battle about, of all things, religion and sexual ethics.


  Who would have thought it would come to this in multicultural, multi-faith Canada? We like to think it is only other countries, like the rivalrous U.S. or India, that are torn apart by religion-fuelled conflict.


  But we had our own culture war in Canada in part because of the way Trudeau, and to some extent NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, hammered Conservative party Leader Andrew Scheer and even Green party Leader Elizabeth May, over two wedge issues with ties to religion -- abortion and same-sex relationships.


  These two ethical concerns were torqued so hard that most of the electorate likely lost track of any real sense of what Canadian Catholics and Sikhs actually believe about abortion and LGBTQ issues. The public might be surprised.


  The Angus Reid Institute found Scheer, an active Catholic, suffered the most as a result of his religion. Commentators say it's a key reason he announced last month he would step down as Conservative leader.


  More than 51 per cent of Canadians told pollsters they developed a negative attitude to Scheer based on what they heard about his Catholicism and his beliefs.

"Olive, Again" by Elizabeth Strout. Random House, 2019. 304 pages.      Few people, fictional or otherwise, make me cringe like Olive Kitteridge does. When I read any of the linked stories in "Olive, Again," a new collection of fiction by Elizabeth Strout, I stop thinking of Olive as a character in a book. She is real to me, her blunt candor a force I do not at first find charming or endearing, as many do, but that is, eventually, irresistible and cause for deep thought.      Rooted in New England sensibilities, Olive has traits we know. She would be one to speak her mind at town meeting or say what she thinks at the coffee shop regardless of who overhears. That's the power of Olive Kitteridge. She says what she thinks. If there's anything amusing about her, it's the magnetism with which she draws people to her in spite of her rough edges. Says her second husband Jack Kennison as he considers her attraction, "She had an honesty - was it an honesty? - she had something about her." He liked the "Olive-ness" of her and thought, "Olive Kitteridge. Tall, big; God she was a strange woman."      Elizabeth Strout's first book about Olive, "Olive Kitteridge," was published in 2008. The work was honored with a Pulitzer Prize and was made into a popular HBO mini-series that was filmed on Massachusetts' North Shore and Cape Ann in 2013. "Olive, Again," this recent collection of linked short stories set in Crosby, Maine, takes up the small matters of everyday life from multiple points of view. Some of the short stories merely reference Olive while others are told from her point of view. She is the hub throughout, structurally and spiritually - disdained, appreciated, loveable by some, life- changing.      "Olive, Again," is nonetheless Olive, exiting. The book tracks Olive as she ages and moves through relationships, health issues and residences. Strout is remarkable for the way she brings readers the story of aging in all its big and small parts, expressed by its characters in moments of loneliness, terror and occasions of happiness. The insights range from small and obvious to profound and surprising. Foremost are issues of identity, regret, wisdom and day-to-day life as it is lived in the later years.      Strout wins over her readers' admiration, also, in how she evokes everyday life. Her writing provides opportunities for identification with characters and events. Details of the daily interactions characters experience and respond to are spot on. We recognize the precision of the storytelling and we note how there is no pause button. Bad things happen. Bad things pass.      For example, after a good day spent on an excursion in Maine, where they lived, Jack and Olive unexpectedly run into Elaine, Jack's former lover while married to his first wife. Elaine was the cause of his premature retirement from teaching at Harvard after she went to the administration with charges of sexual harassment. After seeing her in the public setting of a restaurant so many years later, Jack realizes Elaine had been a careerist who had engineered the affair, the $300,000 payout and advancement in her teaching profession. Driving home with Olive, all these realizations begin to sink in.      "… as he drove along the river without seeing anything except the white line in the road, it returned to him, the fact that Olive was his wife, and that they had had a day together of happiness before seeing Elaine tonight. But it did not feel like happiness that he had experienced with Olive, it felt far away from him now. And so the day they had had together folded over on itself, was done with, gone. In the silence of the dark car Jack was aware of Olive - his wife - aware of her presence in a way that felt insurmountable."      Despite how crushing the truth of Elaine's devious behavior was, despite how much he missed his first wife, Jack understood well that "… he knew, even tonight in his grief, that his marriage to Olive had been surprisingly wonderful in many ways, to go into old age with this woman who was so - so Olive."      When reading "Olive, Again," we appreciate what Strout's characters have to show us about life, aging and acceptance. The experience is both unsettling and entertaining. As for our embrace of Olive, we do more than condone her candor, we celebrate it and maybe even advocate for more of it in the dailiness of our own lives.

NEW YORK -- More than 100 potential jurors in the rape trial of Harvey Weinstein were expected in Manhattan criminal court on Thursday as lawyers strive to choose 12 impartial New Yorkers to decide the former film mogul's fate.


  The potential jurors, who have passed an initial round of pre-screening, include supermodel Gigi Hadid, who said she had met Weinstein before but could nonetheless be fair.


  Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to charges of assaulting two women, and faces life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge, predatory sexual assault.


  Since 2017, more than 80 women, including many famous actresses, have accused him of sexual misconduct dating back decades. Weinstein has denied the allegations, saying any sexual encounters he had were consensual.


  The allegations helped fuel the #MeToo movement, in which women have gone public with misconduct allegations against powerful men in business, entertainment and politics.


  Weinstein's trial kicked off on Jan. 6 and is expected to last up to months.


  During pre-screening, hundreds of potential jurors were asked whether they could be impartial and if their schedules and health allowed them to sit on the trial. In the next phase, known as voir dire, they will face detailed questions about their backgrounds and beliefs by lawyers on both sides.


  Legal experts have said selecting impartial jurors in a case that has attracted a great deal of publicity could be difficult.


  Both sides will likely question potential jurors about their knowledge and opinion of the case, their work history and whether they have been victims of sexual misconduct, experts said.


  Many potential jurors were dismissed in pre-screening after saying they could not be fair and impartial in the case.


  Weinstein, once one of Hollywood's most powerful producers, made his mark with critically acclaimed films such as "The English Patient" and "Shakespeare in Love."


  On Jan. 6, as the New York trial began, Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced new sexual assault charges against Weinstein.


  On Wednesday, Weinstein filed a last-minute motion with a New York appellate court to have his trial delayed and moved out of Manhattan.


  Weinstein last year sought to move the case to Long Island or Albany, saying media scrutiny in Manhattan would make a fair trial impossible, but the motion was denied.

  "It's so much more work to have children. To have lives besides your own that you are responsible for--I didn't take that on," she told _Esquire_'s August 2014 issue. "That did make things easier for me. A baby--that's all day, every day for eighteen years."


  That's not to say she hadn't considered it, per se...


  "Not having a baby might really make things easier, but that doesn't make it an easy decision," she continued. "I like protecting people, but I was never drawn to being a mother. I have it much easier than any of them. That's just what it is. Doesn't mean life isn't sometimes hard. I'm just what I am. I work on what I am."

Topeka police on Wednesday were crediting several Good Samaritans for helping prevent a man from jumping off a bridge that spanned Interstate 470 on the city's south side.
 The incident was reported around 9:55 a.m. on a bridge in the 3900 block of S.W. Martin Drive.
 Topeka police Lt. Manny Munoz said a man who had threatened to hurt himself had one of his legs over the bridge railing when several individuals "intervened" and held the individual.
 Officers who responded to the scene were able to take the man into custody. The man then was transported by American Medical Response ambulance to a local hospital to be treated for minor injuries and to be evaluated, Munoz said.
 The Kansas Highway Patrol was notified and also responded to the scene. Traffic on I-470 was shut down for a brief period in the area of the bridge while officers responded to the incident.
 Additional details weren't immediately available.

Can you be completely unworthy, but also believe you are unconditionally lovable? In Christianity, this is a common underpinning to understanding God's love. I've long struggled with the emotional disconnect between the two. I used to bridge the gap with guilt. Nowadays God and I have a reproach-free relationship. Does that make me arrogant or spiritually healthy?      At a Sunday service, the question was asked, "Raise your hand if you feel deserving of God's love." I timidly raised my hand along with two others, clearly a minority view.      Then a booming rebuke, "None of us are deserving. That's like saying, 'Hey, Jesus, thanks for dying on the cross because I'm entitled. You owe me!'"      Wow, that stung. Then I saw it, "Traffic sign ahead, Guilt and Shame."      Frankly, I do feel deserving because of the basic relationship God and I share: Creator, creature.      As the creature, I'll compare myself to my pet dog, Ginger. I love, love, love her because "she is" and I chose her. What more God? This unfathomable force breathed me into creation for whatever reason. My job is to find my purpose and fulfill it. Meanwhile, God unconditionally loves me, warts and all, which is why he is unfathomable. In a harsh and unforgiving world, you better believe I'll take it.      Why preach to promote our collective unworthiness? I don't understand teaching folks, "You deserve nothing" in the same sentence as "but God loves you!" It's way too easy to get mired in the "you're nothing" part.      For example, do you have a friend who believes he falls short or that she is one big Debbie Downer disappointment? Would you say, "Yes, you are, but guess what? I love you anyway!"   Or would you remind them of their unique abilities and the love others have for them?      A good friend would buck up their spirits, starting with, "You are deserving of love!"      What more God, the ultimate confidence booster?      I reject the notion of being unworthy because insecurity already is built in. I've spent years overcoming feelings of "being less than" because such beliefs never moved me forward. I want the confidence to say to the divine, "I love you back!" The kind of enthusiasm a child has or at least until negativity and self-doubt closes off childlike wonder. From where I sit, we are unconditionally loveable because God created us each to be unique, and therefore, worthy. That doesn't make me entitled. To the contrary, it's humbling.

Not the only the Declaration of Frederick Chiluba in 1991, or the constitutionalisation of the Declaration in Chiluba’s 1996 constitution, or the preamblisation of the Declaration in Lungu’s 2016 constitution – but the kind of Declaration where Pentecostals believe that they must bring about more involvement of the Declaration in the life of the nation. Honourable Sumaili, the Minister of Religious Affairs likes characterising this as "actualisation" of the Declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation even if what is meant by "actualisation" remains as elusive as ever. There is this feeling that actualisation means more "professing" of the faith, and very little "doing" of the faith. Pentecostals would, therefore, tolerate a politician thief, as long as she holds steadfastly to a confession of faith. As far as the Declaration is concerned, Pentecostals agree as hydrogen molecules agree with oxygen molecules to create water. They are like a phone and a sim card. It is quite hilarious to see how a people who cannot see eye to eye on almost all doctrines of the Holy Spirit and "prophetism" agreeing on the Declaration – no matter how it is construed or misunderstood.
