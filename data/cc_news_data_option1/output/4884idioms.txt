It is the first time they have met face-to-face since Barnier went into self- isolation after a member of his team caught coronavirus. A failure to reach an agreement would see Britain and the EU trading on World Trade Organisation terms, with tariffs immediately imposed on goods travelling to and from the continent.
 Britain has been largely trading on the same terms with the EU since it officially left the bloc in January as part of a transition agreement that expires at the end of the year. As it stands, it will leaves Europe’s trade and customs area in five weeks with talks on a follow-on agreement stalled over fishing rights and fair trade rules.
 Both parties warned on Friday that success was not guaranteed, with Barnier tweeting that the “same significant divergences persist”. “We are not far from the take it or leave it moment,” he later told ambassadors from member states, according to a European source familiar with the closed-door meeting.
 Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s lead negotiator Frost said that people were “asking me why we are still talking,” he tweeted. “My answer is that it’s my job to do my utmost to see if the conditions for a deal exist. It is late but a deal is still possible, and I will continue to talk until it’s clear that it isn’t.”
 A no-deal scenario is widely expected to cause economic chaos, with customs checks required at borders. Concern is particularly acute on the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland, where the sudden imposition of a hard border threatens the delicate peace secured by 1999’s Good Friday Agreement.
 Johnson spoke with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin late Friday and “underlined his commitment to reaching a deal that respects the sovereignty of the UK”. But he also “reaffirmed the need to prioritise the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland,” according to a summary of the call released by London.
 Johnson earlier told reporters the “likelihood of a deal is very much determined by our friends and partners in the EU”, adding there were “substantial and important differences to be bridged.”
 A key sticking point is the EU’s demand for a post-Brexit “level playing field”, with punishing trade penalties if either side diverges from agreed standards or state aid regulations, but Britain does not want to be bound by rules made in Brussels.
 Britain’s fishing waters are also a hot topic, with sources on Friday saying that Barnier told envoys that London was asking that European access to them be cut by 80 percent, while the EU was willing to accept 15 to 18 percent.
 The talks have already pushed on much longer than expected and time is running out for ratification of any deal by the European Parliament by the end of the year.
 Members of the European Parliament have expressed frustration with the delays and may have to ratify a deal between Christmas and the New Year.
 In Brussels, one source close to the talks said she would “eat my hat” if there was a deal by Monday, echoing a chorus of complaints that Johnson was playing the clock

My brief training as a historian has taught me the folly of obsessing over the what-ifs of history, and I do not want to speculate on what the outcome of the Timex strike could have been if more women were involved –– nobody benefits from such speculation, least of all the women of Dundee who had to pick up the pieces and begin life anew once the cold heart of capital decided they were no longer valuable. But the anecdote does tether the unhappiness I articulated in my article to something greater than the concerns of a bourgeois student activist in the 2010s, to an ongoing (but not inevitable, not insurmountable!) problem on the left.

 But Rosie is perhaps the perfect distillation of American Steel's primary business philosophy. The company, located in Lockwood, believes that incorporating new and specialized technologies with the traditional nuts and bolts of steel manufacturing is the best way to corner the market.

Last week the unelected LCDPHE board voted to escalate their business-crushing authoritarianism from “Level 2” (yellow) to “Level 4” (red). This closes all bars, closes all indoor service at restaurants, stops all indoor events among other restrictions. They put no end date on their tyrannical order.
 Businesses that were barely hanging on will go out of business. The Christmas bonus for those families depending on paychecks from them will be a pink slip and unemployment. At least Scrooge only ruined the Cratchit family’s Christmas.
 I have spoken to several of these restaurant owners and each one told me the unsolicited story of employees breaking down into tears in front of them. They can’t lose their jobs and still make ends meet. Many have worked at that place for years; they’re family. If the owners didn’t defy the law, there’d be no presents under the tree for their children.
 If they followed the law many would go out of business anyway. A Hobson’s choice.
 But “follow the science” say the little tyrants to justify everything they do.
 And sure enough, COVID cases are up in Larimer county, but the hot zone is Colorado State University. Good for those kids. They have near-zero chance of being hospitalized and even less chance of dying. Let them power this through to immunity and keep them away from the vulnerable in the meantime.
 But cases of COVID in the city of Loveland (which has the poor fortune of being located in Larimer county not liberty-respecting Weld) are few and far between.
 I wrote this column just before Thanksgiving Day. By the time you read this those Loveland Lawless could have been beaten into submission. Or they could still be trying to hold on, hopefully inspiring other business owners around the state to do the same.
 I hope you’ll support them. It’s worth the drive north to dine at the Loveland Chophouse, McGraff’s, Senior Raphel, Wicked Tequila Room, Grimm Brothers Brewhouse, CJ’s Patio Grill, AKA Kitchen, Cactus Grill and lots of other bars, brewhouses and restaurants.
 If they are forced to close, I hope these Loveland Lawless will do what city governments do actually support — peaceful protests that tear down statues, vandalize, firebomb police cars and smash the windows of their own, former businesses.

“Aseefa will be present on the occasion to represent the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who has contracted Covid-19 and has isolated himself in Karachi,” former PPP Senator Sehar Kamran told The News when contacted.
 She said although Bilawal will be addressing the rally via video link from Karachi, Aseefa’s physical presence will quash unnecessary speculation that the PPP has even slightly distanced itself from the event. “We don’t want to give rise to needless speculation and rumours.”
 However, Sehar Kamran denied that Aseefa’s participation amounted to her formal launch in politics. “She has already been taking part in various political activities. Since she is the daughter of Benazir Bhutto, she has to be a Benazir.”
 Much before Bilawal had taken a formal plunge into politics, Asif Ali Zardari had repeatedly talked about his son’s involvement in politics and his future stewardship of the PPP. As Bilawal completed his studies, he jumped into the political arena and has since been active to revive the PPP in areas where it has suffered losses.
 Some time ago, the family patriarch, Asif Zardari, seemed to have taken a decision that Bilawal will run the PPP while Aseefa will assist him in politics where needed. However, his elder daughter, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, would stay away from politics. For this reason, Bakhtawar has not been seen at political events organised by the PPP for a long time.
 After Zardari’s illness and earlier incarceration, Bilawal has been spearheading the PPP almost single-handedly. He alone ran the party’s campaign for the general elections to the Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly where the PPP stood first in terms of number of popular votes among all the political parties.
 In his lifetime, especially when he was behind bars during General Ziaul Haq’s regime, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had also patronised and groomed Benazir Bhutto from amongst his children to come into politics at a very difficult time for the party as well as for the Bhutto family. Although Begum Nusrat Bhutto was the formal chair of the PPP during his imprisonment, Benazir Bhutto had effective control over the party not only during the martial law period but subsequently as well.
 Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had kept his two sons and other daughter away from politics. Murtaza Bhutto did eventually form his own political party but he could not get much room in the political field compared to his sister, who became prime minister twice.
 She was all set to win the parliamentary polls once more to become the prime minister for a third time but was tragically assassinated as she was leaving the venue of her campaign rally in Liaquat Bagh, Rawalpindi.
 In view of this family history, if Aseefa formally joins politics from the PPP platform it will not be a surprising development.

Full moon occurs this Monday, Nov. 30. As we do every 27.322 days, our lovely satellite bathes in full sunlight, the "Man in the Moon" showing its fullest as we gaze back in wonder.      The Chinese launched Chang'e 5, another robotic mission, on Nov. 23, with the ambitious goal of bringing some moon rocks back to Earth Dec. 16-17. Touchdown on the lunar surface was slated Nov. 27 near the edge of the near side, on the upper left as we in the Northern Hemisphere face Old Luna.      Or in less scientific terms, in the right brow of the Man of the Moon, to the right of his right eye (on our left). Neither the Chinese, NASA or anyone's space agency refers to their landing zones that way, as far as I ever heard.      Designed like the manned Apollo lunar missions, a lander will depart from the orbiting spacecraft and, once the rocks are aboard, will launch an ascent vehicle to meet back with the orbiter for the return to Earth.      China plans to bring back 4.4 pounds of the moon; the first lunar sample returned since the Russians had a similar unmanned mission in 1976.   NASA still plans to return astronauts to the moon by 2024 aboard their Artemis missions.      We do live in amazing times.      Even with the lure of reaching out to other worlds with our robots and someday again with our astronaut boots, there can be no diminishing of the enjoyment we share, the satisfaction we can have, in just "looking up." From the casual admirer of the night sky to the professional astronomer, we have the universe all around us in common, including the moon's shining face.      This Saturday night, the almost-full moon is situated between the bright, red- orange star Aldebaran (below the moon) and the glittering star cluster the Pleiades, to the upper right.      Why do we always see the same side of the moon? The reason is the moon actually rotates once around on its axis in the same time it takes to go around the Earth. The effect is the same side keeps facing the Earth. This is called synchronous rotation.      The orbit is not quite circular; the moon varies in distance from its farthest point (apogee) and closest point (perigee) by 12%.      Not only does the Man in the Moon, in its regular dance, approach and withdraw from us, the lunar face nods on a regular rhythm.      The slight eccentricity of the moon's orbit results in a changing of its angular velocity as it goes around. When the moon is at perigee (closest), its moving faster than its rotation. This lets us see up to eight degrees of longitude on its eastern (right) far side.      Conversely, when the moon is at apogee (farthest), it is moving slower than its rotation, causing it to peek 8 degrees of longitude on its western (left) far side.      That makes the moon rock (no pun intended) to the left and right.      As if that wasn't enough to make our head spin, the lunar orbit is also inclined to the Earth's orbit around the sun by 5.1 degrees. This makes the rotational axis of the moon seem to rotate towards and away from us during one full orbit. The effect is we get to see the Man in the Moon bow its head toward us, or put its chin up (the moon is "looking up") - allowing us to view almost seven degrees in latitude beyond the pole on the far side.   Someone standing on the Earth's North or South Poles can actually see a little more of this nod - a full degree more in lunar latitude.      All this nodding about is called "libration" and amounts to us seeing a grand total of 59% of the moon through the course of a lunar revolution.   Imagine this set to music. It would be a long, drawn-out song to be sure.      Being able to see a tad more on one lunar limb or the other means at certain times, a crater, mountain chain or lava plane (maria) comes into view and appears less elongated than at other times. Examining the rugged, lunar horizon in our telescopes, we can plainly appreciate the spherical shape of our Moon as libration gives us tantalizing peeks of the 41% perpetually hidden from view.      Astronomers are still theorizing why the moon's far side is so different than the near. The vast maria that mark the familiar "Man in the Moon's" features are almost entirely on the side facing Earth. The back of the "Man's head" is mostly mountains and craters.      The Soviet Union's Luna 3 probe first photographed the lunar far side in October of 1959. NASA's Ranger 4 was the first spacecraft to impact the far side in April 1962, but failed to send back any scientific data. In January 2019, the Chinese landed the first space probe (Chang'e 4) successfully on the far side.      There were nine Apollo missions that orbited the moon between 1968 and 1972, involving six landings. On board were 27 astronauts, the only persons to have ever seen the far side with their own eyes.      In a few years, there could be more.      It must be an amazing experience to be on the "back" of the moon, the Earth hidden from sight with no radio communication, thankful their craft would soon bring them around to see the Earthrise once again.   Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.

As a documentary filmmaker, Hao Wu has focused throughout his career on smaller, character-driven stories that bridge the divide between his native China, where he grew up, and his adoptive home in America. In 2013’s “People’s Republic of Desire,” for example, Wu followed three young Chinese people as they pursued internet fame through live-streaming, while his 2019 Netflix film “All in My Family” chronicled his tradition-minded parents’ road to accepting his homosexuality.
 When he was first approached in February about making a film about the growing COVID-19 pandemic, Wu wasn’t sure how to approach such an enormous, headline- dominating subject. “Normally I tend to shy away from newsy topics,” he says. “As a filmmaker, I don’t know what more I could add to a topic that’s being well covered by the news media already.”
 Based in New York, where he lives with his partner and their two children, Wu began reaching out to reporters and filmmakers on the ground in Wuhan to find out what they’d been seeing. Poring through footage from overrun hospitals where healthcare workers heroically struggled to save as many lives as they could, and reflecting on his own family back in China — including a dying grandfather he was unable to visit due to travel restrictions — Wu quickly realized that even this massive, globe-shaking story ultimately boiled down to the sort of intimate human drama that had always fascinated him.
 The resulting film, “76 Days,” offers an alternately harrowing and inspiring look inside four hospitals in Wuhan during the country’s 2½-month lockdown as it became the world’s first COVID-19 epicenter. Co-directed by Wu and two Chinese filmmakers — Weixi Chen and a state-run-media reporter who is remaining anonymous so as not to run afoul of the government — the film premiered in September at the Toronto International Film Festival and will be released Dec. 4 in more than 50 virtual cinemas nationwide, including Laemmle Theaters in L.A.

New Delhi, November 29 (ANI): The new farm laws are "reformist and revolutionary" but should have been passed after more extensive dialogue with the farming community, said BJP MP Brijendra Singh, who is the great-grandson of legendary farmer leader Chaudhary Sir Chhotu Ram.   Singh said the government would not have to deal with agitations if there had been extensive dialogue with stakeholders.   "I do feel there is some lack of dialogue prior to passing of these bills in parliament. Had all the stakeholders been taken on board prior to passage of bills, we would have better situation now," said the great-grandson of the man who was architect of mandi laws.   While party leaders said the farmers' agitation has been politicised, Singh who is a son of former union minister Chaudhary Birendra Singh, had a different view.   "When issues of public are involved, politics is bound to come in. Politics isn't a dirty word. Politics is bound to be there on such an issue of this magnitude," said Singh.   On Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar's alleged accusations of those supporting Khalistan demand being involved in agitation, Singh said that once an agitation attains such a magnitude, there are elements who try to spoil it, be they religious or pro-Khalistan.  
 "They see a window of opportunity for them. We must be careful," added Singh   He, however, is all praise for these laws. The BJP MP believes that government has done it with good intentions. Govt procurement on MSP will continue.   "Agriculture sector was crying out for a change to break out of rut that it has been in. The government has taken a bold decision by bringing these farm laws which seek to provide new direction. However, it's a time consuming process. This will take a long time for private sector to come in and infrastructure to be in place and it will give farmers to see for themselves whether it is for their benefit or not," said the BJP MP from Hisar.   The MP said the basic purpose of farmers marching towards Capital is to have a conversation with government on three farm laws and that after union home minister's statement assuring them of dialogue if they go to the venue, discussions can be initiated.   "That more than amply answers that these farmers are agitating for. They are here to have a dialogue with the government and that is what they are here for. Earlier, government has given them a date. They say why not have it now. That now has also been answered. I feel they will come around after having discussions with various unions who are agitating," says the MP.   Commenting on the war of words between CMs of Haryana and Punjab, Singh said the issue calls for a serious dialogue between stakeholders be it farmers, two governments of Punjab and Haryana, and of Delhi, UP, Uttarakhand. Everyone should put their heads together and resolve this, he said.   "Amarinder is such a senior politician and he has been CM a few times. He fully understands that resolution has to come through dialogue, with farmers, unions, central and Haryana and Punjab governments. There is no getting away from dialogue and for a CM to say that he will not have any dialogue with the neighbouring CM is uncalled for and bit of overreaction and could have been avoided," says the BJP MP.

These gains, however, were not reflected in the practical decisions taken in Paris. The INDCs (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) adopted were totally inadequate and would result not in global temperature increase of 2°C by the end of the century – far less of 1.5°C – but in a disastrous 3.4°C from which there would be no way back. Since fossil fuel emissions have risen by a further 4 per cent since then they would have to fall by 7.6 per cent every year from now until 2030 to stay within the 1.5°C ceiling. We, therefore, have a mountain to climb in Glasgow next year when the INDCs are due to be upgraded into something that can actually tackle the problem.

 The district has targeted to raise paddy on about 10,000 hectares during the pisanam season. Usually, the north-east monsoon remains active till mid- October. However, this year, as the monsoon is still active, farmers are a happy lot as tanks under the Tamirabarani system have almost reached their full storage level. Channels too have been getting water. “Under these circumstances, the target of raising paddy in 10,000 ha would not be a difficult task”, the official said.

Round 1: We open with a lock-up as Hektor takes down Moodo in a headlock… they roll on the mat, but Moodo scoots free before he tried to go for a takedown. Hektor stuffs that as they go to ground, but Moodo rolls in for an armbar that Hektor manages to escape. Hektor looks to pin down Moodo’s shoulders, but Moodo bridges up and monkey flips free as we get double-pin teases with a load of near-falls. A shoulder tackle knocks down Moodo, but he’s back with a hiptoss, before duelling elbows and dropkicks led to a stand-off. Again going to ground, Hektor looks to work Moodo’s arm, going for a bridging hammerlock a la Axel Dieter Jr… but they’re right by the ropes, so there’s an instant break as the clock wound down.

We believe that heightened bed demand in Europe will contribute an approximate ~400bps tailwind on the back of Covid-19 over the coming periods, as cases have begun to surge there again. Already in Q4, ~$25 million of European bed revenue was attributed to Covid-related demand, thus, the trend will likely continue across European markets in the near term. Therefore, we've modelled ~$30 million in Covid-related bed revenue over the coming periods into Q1 2021. Additionally, the surgical solutions segment decreased 29% and contributed ~$80 million to the top, coming in well above estimations. This segment faced headwinds across the quarter, as large construction projects continue to be delayed in key geographical zones. Thus, demand for capital equipment was slumped also. Management are confident in a strong recovery from here in Surgical Solutions and have included this sentiment into 2021 guidance.
 ## Guidance and Outlook
 Although hospital net capital expenditures are showing a recovery from setbacks earlier this year, HRC will likely face headwinds from delays in large capital outlays that are tied up in construction and deferred medical procedures. Certainly, there have been signs of a positive recovery in deferred procedures at the back end of 2020, which will have a net impact on the financial position of various hospitals within HRS's network. However, considering the state of affairs this year, including the net impact from patient deferrals this year, hospitals will likely remain tight on budgetary allocation and capital allocation over the coming years. It is likely that the preference will remain with orthopaedic electives due to their contribution to top and bottom lines. We've confirmed much of this with hospital executives we speak with regularly. So, HRC will likely be forced to dance around this and discover channels to realise the upside in spite of CAPEX uncertainties from hospitals.
 To illustrate, we believe that the net impact of deferrals will realise a significant downgrade in hospital CAPEX over the coming year at least. We've seen evidence of this reflected already in major health centres that have reported ~60% reduction in capital spend this year, with an average ~30% YoY reduction for the remainder of FY2020 in a number of entities. Thus, HRC will certainly absorb the shock of this trend over the next year, which will hamper the cadence of growth to mid single-digits, as guided by management. Guidance has indicated a ~3%-5% decline at the top, which is a slight downgrade from consensus. Management believe free cash flow of ~$300 million is not unreasonable to expect for FY2021, and we would confer with this range, based on the macroeconomic and end market crosscurrents that will be absorbed by HRC over the coming year.

The protesters in Denver want political change and they are willing to litter, burn, vandalize and loot to move the needle to the left, toward a more socialist world where other people are forced to give them things.
 The Loveland Lawless are a little different. Instead of tearing down, their rebellion is to build up. Instead of demanding money from others, their revolt is to risk their life savings, compete to earn money and employ people in their community. That earned money is then taxed (and then redistributed).
 Their act of defiance is to work.
 These criminals are heroes. Theirs is a different type of civil disobedience.
 To be precise, some 78, and I expect that number to grow, bars, restaurants and other small businesses in Loveland have announced they, together, will break the law and stay open even though the county government ordered them shut.
 The board of Larimer County Department of Public Health and Environment (LCDPHE) is appointed, not elected. They can’t be voted out of office or recalled, so they have no direct accountability to the citizens whose lives they are obliterating. But they do have the legal authority to close down businesses under the scare of COVID.
 Businesses had already been struggling to survive after LCDPHE voted in their “Level 2” (yellow), “Safer at Home” restrictions. That cut restaurant capacity to 50% making it nearly impossible for these businesses to survive.
 Restaurants make or break their profitability on packed Friday and Saturday nights. Fortunately, SOME of them were able to create some outdoor seating in the warm summer days. Winter’s here. None of them can do that now.

Fuller kicked with a holder rather than using a tee in a designed squib kick, and the senior sent a low kick to the 35-yard line where it was pounced on by Missouri’s Mason Pack. Fuller didn’t get any other opportunities in Vanderbilt’s 41-0 loss to Missouri.
 Coach Derek Mason made clear that Fuller kicked for the Commodores due to need, not for history or publicity. COVID-19 protocols and restrictions left Mason with very few options, prompting him to reach out to the soccer team for help.
 Fuller, a 6-foot-2 goalkeeper, decided she was up for the challenge.
 “I’m not about making statements,” Mason said. “This was out of necessity. You look at our week. Our students had gone home. The ability to have access to students and tryouts was almost nil in terms of like what’s available. ... That just happened to be the most viable option.”
 After Fuller's kick, she went straight to the sideline, where she high-fived some of her new teammates and swapped some elbow bumps. Fuller's parents watched and cheered from the stands along with her boyfriend and best friend.
 Fuller practiced with the Commodores this week after helping the Commodores win the SEC Tournament last weekend. Fuller said her longest field goal in practice was 38 yards.
 She wore “Play Like A Girl” on the back of her helmet. The senior will get to keep the No. 32 jersey she wore Saturday, the same as her number when playing soccer.
 Fuller even gave a halftime pep talk, which she usually left to her soccer teammates, telling her new teammates that Vandy won the SEC soccer tournament title by cheering for each other whether on the field or the sideline.
 “We had a different mindset coming out the second half,” quarterback Mike Wright said.
 After her kickoff, reaction poured in on social media. Fuller was the No. 2 trending topic on Twitter, followed by Vandy. Her soccer team wrote on Twitter: “Glass. Everywhere.”
 As in glass ceiling.
 Pat McAfee, a former NFL punter, reviewed Fuller's squib kick, noting the ball didn't go out of bounds and there was no chance of a return, setting up the defense.
 “Congrats to (at)SarahFuller_27 for being THE FIRST EVER WOMAN TO KICKOFF A POWER 5 GAME,” McAfee wrote. “Incredibly rare to be the ‘1st ever person to do something’ these days..this is really cool.”
 No woman had appeared in an SEC football game or for any Power Five team. Liz Heaston became the first woman to score with two extra points for Willamette in NAIA on Oct. 18, 1997.

The three-time world champions went into the match under huge pressure after slumping to the Wallabies then the Pumas, leaving them facing the prospect of three losses in a row for the first time in more than 20 years.
 But spurred on by a backlash from their notoriously demanding fans, Ian Foster’s team bounced back emphatically with a five tries to nil win in brutally hot and humid conditions at McDonald Jones Stadium in Newcastle, north of Sydney.
 It was a far more disciplined All Blacks who dominated the first-half, going to the break 10-0 ahead, but there were also missed opportunities with two tries disallowed. Argentina made 10 changes to the team that drew with the Wallabies last week and they lacked cohesion, with New Zealand taking full advantage.
 Two tries in quick succession from young fullback Will Jordan in the final quarter sealed the victory and a crucial bonus point for winning by three tries or more. It all-but secured the Tri Nations silverware for New Zealand, who have 11 points from four games.
 Australia play Argentina next week and either side could feasibility edge out the All Blacks but it would take a bonus point win and by a huge margin given New Zealand’s vastly superior points differential.
 Defeat brought Argentina’s fairy-tale run to a shuddering halt in the tournament’s penultimate round after they beat New Zealand 25-15 then battled to a 15-15 draw with Australia. It proved extra painful for Mario Ledesma’s men, who were hoping to lift the spirits of their nation after the death of football legend Diego Maradona. New Zealand captain Sam Cane laid an All Blacks jersey emblazoned with Maradona’s name shirt number, 10, in the centre circle ahead of the kick-off as a mark of respect.
 Victory eased the pressure on Foster, who had been facing calls for his axing after just five games in charge following their twin defeats. He shuffled his forward pack to better deal with Argentina’s physicality and they responded well. Their scrum was in charge and they cut out the errors that cost them a fortnight ago.
 Jordan, in only his second Test, grabbed the all-important third try with 13 minutes left after picking up a wayward ball and sprinting to the line, then got another when he intercepted a pass and darted down the wing. Patrick Tuipulotu put the icing on the cake with their fifth try five minutes after the hooter.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — In the end, the Joker got the last laugh.
 It’s unknown whether or not Auburn quarterback Bo Nix meant to belittle Mac Jones last week when he stated the Heisman contender “does a great job managing the game. Regardless, the statement didn’t necessarily sit well with the Crimson Tide’s players.
 “When I saw it, I sent it to Mac and showed it to him,” receiver DeVonta Smith said of Nix’s quote. “It was just funny just seeing that. But I mean, at the end of the day, people are gonna talk, they’re gonna do what they want. At the end of the day, we’re just gonna show up, execute the game plan and do what we’ve gotta do.”
 Jones was far from a game-manager Saturday night. The Alabama quarterback completed 18 of 26 passes for 302 yards and a career-high five touchdowns, tearing apart an Auburn secondary that came into the afternoon ranked second in the SEC in pass defense. Jones is just the second passer to reach the 300-yard mark against the Tigers this season. His five touchdown passes are the most Auburn has allowed since former Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa also torched the Tigers for five scores through the air during the 2018 Iron Bowl.
 Saturday’s performance helped Jones regain his momentum in the Heisman race after posting a season-low 230 yards through the air against Kentucky last week.
 “Last week, I feel like I didn’t play as well as I could have and just tried to improve on the little things throughout the week,” Jones said. “But all that other stuff just goes to my teammates. They’re always gonna do their jobs, so I have to match them and do my job, as well. They make it easy. And you’ve just gotta keep improving each week, and that’s how we have to look at it.”
 While Nix’s comments came back to haunt him, his play on the field didn’t do him many favors either. The sophomore completed 23 of 38 passes for 227 yards with two interceptions. He did manage to punch in a 1-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter. Although, by that point, Jones and the Tide had already put the game to bed.

The case shocked France with celebrities and politicians alike condemning the officers’ actions, and has brought debate over President Emmanuel Macron’s law to boiling point.
 Macron on Friday called the incident an "unacceptable attack" and asked the government to come up with proposals to "fight against discrimination".
 One of the most controversial elements of the new law is Article 24, which would criminalise the publication of images of on-duty police officers with the intent of harming their "physical or psychological integrity".
 It was passed by the National Assembly last week -- although it is awaiting Senate approval -- provoking rallies and protests across France.
 Rally organisers are calling for the article to be withdrawn, claiming that it contradicts "the fundamental public freedoms of our Republic". "This bill aims to undermine the freedom of the press, the freedom to inform and be informed, the freedom of expression," one of Saturday’s protest organisers said.
 Trade unions are expected to join the demonstrations, with members of the yellow vests -- whose sometimes violent protests in 2018 and 2019 shook the country -- also expected.
 In Paris, the authorities had demanded that organisers limit the rally to a single location, but on Friday evening officials authorised a march.
 And in a sign that the government could be preparing to backtrack, Prime Minister Jean Castex announced Friday that he would appoint a commission to redraft Article 24. The government says the provision is intended to protect officers from doxxing and online abuse, but critics say it is further evidence of the Macron administration’s slide to the right.
 But media unions say it could give police a green light to prevent journalists -- and social media users -- from documenting abuses.

NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — The theft of a lemur from the San Francisco Zoo in October stirred memories of Sunny, the red panda who vanished nearly four years ago from the Virginia Zoo in Norfolk. The tips line rarely rings these days, but Sunny’s disappearance remains the “greatest mystery” of zoo director Greg Bockheim’s career. Without a trace. After 35 years in his field, he still can’t get over that. Bockheim can find himself lying awake at night still wondering “where she could have gone, what could have happened to her. I just hope she’s out there somehow and doing well.” While the lemur theft was quickly solved with an arrest and the recovery of the ring-tailed victim, the Norfolk case has long gone cold. Staff discovered Sunny, a 19-month-old female, missing from the zoo’s red panda exhibit on the morning of Jan. 24, 2017. Red pandas, an endangered species, are about the size and shape of raccoons. Cute and cuddly looking with a fluffy, long tail, they’re coveted in the black-market exotic pet trade, according the Red Panda Network, a conservation group. Natives of the mountains of South Asia, fewer than 10,000 remain in the wild. But there’s no indication Sunny was abducted on that stormy night — no signs of forced entry or anything suspicious. Prevailing theory is that Sunny got out by accident. The most-likely scenario, Bockheim believes, is that Sunny — shying away from the lustful advances of her male exhibit mate — slipped off a wet tree branch extending over the fence line. An extensive hunt in and around the Granby Street zoo, aided by tracking dogs, thermal cameras, drones, baited traps and scores of volunteers, came up empty handed. Sunny had been outfitted with a standard zoo microchip — useful for ID purposes but with no...

Magdy struck as stoppage time loomed behind closed doors because of the coronavirus pandemic after Amr el Soleya had given Ahly an early lead and ‘Shikabala’ scored a magnificent equaliser before half-time.
 With 85 minutes gone, Magdy controlled the ball with his knee outside the area and hammered it into the net to earn Ahly a record-extending ninth Champions League title and first since 2013.
 The climax was in keeping with a thrilling final that completed a competition which began in August last year and was constantly delayed by Covid-19.
 Success for Ahly meant South African Pitso Mosimane became only the third coach after Argentine Oscar Fullone and Egyptian Mahmoud el Gohary to win the Champions League title with two clubs.
 Mosimane guided Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa to a 3-1 aggregate victory over Zamalek in the 2016 title decider.
 Before the kick off in a stadium that would normally be packed to its 74,000 capacity for a Cairo derby, both teams observed a moment of silence in honour of Argentine icon Diego Maradona, who died on Wednesday.
 Ahly took a fifth-minute lead when Amr el Soleya rose to powerfully head a corner kick into the net after goalkeeper Mohamed Abou Gabal had conceded the set piece under pressure from Hussein el Shahat.

That interview speaks to me, in no uncertain terms, of the dulled imagination of a left that does not fully incorporate feminist aims. These strikers’ desire for inclusion of women did not represent a conservative attack on trade union politics, but a yearning for different approaches to class struggle. When I first wrote the piece, I had only been exposed to feminism as a rather abstract concept, as an eagerness for equality accompanied by certain cultural signifiers restrained to the confines of capitalist society. In the intervening years, I have been made aware of the breadth and depth of feminist imaginations, from everything as abstract as a complete revolution of social relations to everything as concrete as better representation in industrial disputes. Imaginings of a feminist, anti-capitalist future can only happen when women are incorporated into the movement in good faith and not as tokens, and when men do not dominate the left wholesale, as in Dundee in 1993.

The starting point for addressing all this is an ecosocialist world view. But there is a long way to go. Whilst the concept is more widely accepted today than ever before, there is, as yet, no common view as to what exactly it implies. To some it simply means taking the environmental struggle more seriously, to others (including us) it redefines the socialist project. We are no longer engaged in a struggle ‘simply’ to end capitalism and replace it with a democratic and socially just society. The task today is to replace capitalism with a society that is sustainable for the long term and capable of constructing a new, and none-exploitative, relationship between human beings and nature.

Jurgen Klopp’s side took the lead through Diogo Jota’s second half strike after Brighton’s Neal Maupay had missed a penalty in the first half.
 But Liverpool were stunned in stoppage-time when Andrew Robertson’s challenge on Danny Welbeck was ruled a penalty after Stuart Attwell overturned his initial decision.
 Gross converted from the spot, leaving Klopp sarcastically applauding the officials at the end of a disappointing week for Liverpool after their shock Champions League defeat at home to Atalanta.
 Liverpool went back to the top of the table as a result of their draw, but the champions are just one point ahead of previous leaders Tottenham.
 Tottenham would regain pole position if they avoid defeat at Chelsea on Sunday, while the Blues will go top if they win the London derby.
 It was one of those days for Liverpool, who also saw goals correctly disallowed by VAR for offside against Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.
 There was more bad news for injury-ravaged Liverpool as James Milner was forced off in the second half.
 Klopp had claimed it was almost a “crime” that Liverpool had to feature in the early Saturday match after playing in the Champions League just three days earlier.
 He made six changes from the Atalanta game as Jota, Fabinho, Roberto Firmino, Andrew Robertson, Takumi Minamino and Nathaniel Phillips came into the starting line-up.
 Liverpool should have taken the lead in the opening moments when Fabinho unfurled a perfectly-weighted long pass that picked out Salah’s run, but the Egyptian fired wastefully wide from just inside the Brighton area.
 With Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez injured and Joel Matip rested, Klopp’s makeshift defence were exposed when Maupay’s pass sent the unmarked Aaron Connolly racing through on goal.
 But with just Liverpool ‘keeper Alisson Becker to beat, Connolly lost his nerve and timidly guided his shot well wide.
 Connolly’s runs were causing Liverpool problems and when the Brighton forward made another well-timed incursion in the 20th minute, he was tripped in the penalty area by the panicked Neco Williams after he was caught out of position.
 Maupay stepped up to take the spot-kick, but his side-foot effort went wide despite Alisson diving the wrong way.
 It was a lucky escape for Liverpool and Maupay’s misery was compounded when he limped off injured moments later.
 Liverpool thought they had hit back with a sucker punch when Salah sprinted onto Firmino’s pass and scuffed his shot past Brighton keeper Mat Ryan.
 But VAR curtailed Salah’s celebrations as he was ruled offside by the tightest of margins.
 After a spluttering first half, Klopp’s men finally found some rhythm following Jordan Henderson’s introduction at the break.
 In a warning that Brighton failed to heed, Jota turned to flash a shot narrowly wide and in the 60th minute the Portugal forward put Liverpool.
 Robertson found Salah and his pass teed up Jota on the edge of the Brighton area.
 Skipping past two Brighton defenders, Jota cleverly drilled low shot back into the bottom corner.
 Jota has enjoyed a superb start to life with the Premier League champions, scoring nine times in 14 games since signing from Wolves in September.
 Salah was substituted just after the goal, but he didn’t seem happy with Klopp’s move, gesticulating with his hands and ignoring the German when he walked past him to the bench.
 Liverpool were seconds away from three points when Robertson went to clear in his own area as Welbeck closed in.
 Robertson’s foot made contact with Welbeck, but there were few appeals from Brighton before Attwell awarded a contentious penalty after consulting the pitchside monitor.
 With Maupay off the pitch, Gross took this one and fired down the middle to salvage an unexpected point.

Hardworking, loyal, dedicated, genuine and true friend are just a few of the words that describe Ford Martin Stewart, otherwise known as “Pike” to his friends, by some who can lay claim to calling him friend for decades.
 Pike, 88, who was a mainstay at his North Broad Street business, died on Monday, Nov. 23. Pike opened his business, Pike’s Gulf, in 1969.
 Jeff Shoe said that he remembers the station being there “as far back as I can remember. I can remember going when I was in high school and buying gas for 25 cents.”
 Having been in business for more than 60 years owning a gas station and wrecker service, Pike had more than just customers show up at his station, they were his friends.

The roadblocks have centered in part on efforts by the auditor's office to document the scale of the theft and the total amount of money since recovered. According to ESD's estimates, criminals stole $576 million, of which $356 million has been recovered as of Friday.
 McCarthy, a Democrat not generally known as a political bomb-thrower, was at pains to acknowledge the difficulties ESD faces.
 "I understand that they have had a tsunami of challenges with regard to the number of unemployment claims," said McCarthy, referring to the wave of pandemic-related layoffs in March and April. "But right now it is critically important … that we are able to complete this work."
 In a statement, LeVine said her agency has welcomed the audits from the start, and shares a goal with the auditor of continuously improving the unemployment system. She added ESD has put in place procedures to get information to auditors as quickly as possible.
 "We remain firmly committed to full transparency and are collaborating closely with the State Auditor and her staff, as we have all along," LeVine said.

Round 3: The round starts with Marik still on the outside, so Metehan joins him… but it’s a con as Marik charges Metehan into the apron before an apron PK was countered with a leg sweep. Metehan covers Marik with the ring apron and stomps on him - which gets a yellow card and the €100 fine - before they returned to the ring for a slingshot DDT. Some Danielson elbows follow - and there’s your stoppage, just as Metehan predicted. A better outing for Marik, but still the same depressing result, complete with a second yellow card for Metehan for some boots after the match. By my reckoning, that’s seven yellows and €745 of fines for him - he’ll need to win the tournament just to break even at this rate.

Nairobi, 29 nov (EFE).- Un convicto que estaba cumpliendo cadena perpetua por el atentado contra la Universidad de Garissa en abril de 2015 en el que murieron 148 personas, se suicidó usando una manta en una prisión de Nairobi, informó este domingo la Policía keniana.
 Rashid Charles Mberesero, tanzano de 26 años, fue encontrado muerto en su celda en la Prisión de Máxima Seguridad de Kamiti, en la capital keniana, colgado en la rejilla metálica de la ventana de la celda con un trozo de manta atada alrededor de su cuello minutos después de su muerte, recogió hoy el medio keniano The Star que cita fuentes policiales y de la administración penitenciaria.
 'Se suicidó alrededor de las 15.20 horas en su pabellón (bloque H) usando una cuerda improvisada tomada de una manta. El fallecido era un paciente de psiquiatría y estaba medicado', indicó un informe policial según recoge el medio The Standard.
 El fallecido había apelado su sentencia y el caso estaba pendiente en los tribunales de Milimani en Nairobi.
 El 3 de julio de 2019, Mberesero y otros dos hombres más fueron condenados por delitos de conspiración para cometer un ataque terrorista, comisión del ataque y ser miembros del grupo somalí Al Shabab.
 Mberesero, arrestado en el lugar de la masacre y que no pudo explicar su presencia allí, fue sentenciado a cadena perpetua, mientras los kenianos Hassan Edin y Mohamed Abdi (alias Mohamed Ali Abikar) fueron condenados a 41 años de cárcel por haber planeado activamente el ataque junto a terroristas de Al Shabab.
 El 2 de abril de 2015 un comando terrorista tomó el control del campus de la Universidad de Garissa (este del país), ciudad próxima a Somalia, durante dieciséis horas, ante la pasividad de las fuerzas de seguridad, que tardaron más de doce en llegar a la zona.
 Al menos 148 personas fueron asesinadas en este atentado, muchos de ellos estudiantes, por ser cristianos, y otras 79 resultaron heridas.
 EL PEOR ATAQUE SUFRIDO EN KENIA DESDE 1998
 El ataque de Garissa constituye el peor sufrido en Kenia desde el atentado de la red Al Qaeda contra la embajada de Estados Unidos en Nairobi en 1998, en el que murieron 213 personas.
 Al Shabab, grupo afiliado a Al Qaeda, controla parte del territorio del centro y sur de Somalia, y combate desde hace una década con el fin de instaurar un Estado islámico de corte wahabí.
 Somalia vive en un estado de guerra y caos desde 1991, cuando fue derrocado el dictador Mohamed Siad Barre, lo que dejó al país sin Gobierno efectivo y en manos de milicias islamistas y señores de la guerra. EFE

That’s true even in her hometown. So while the unveiling of a statue is usually a festive occasion, few in Grantham expect Thatcher’s homecoming to be celebrated as a hero’s return.
 “If you’re a Conservative,” said Graham Newton, the news editor of the weekly Grantham Journal, “you want a statue, and you want her recognized. But if you’re not, there’s a lot of people who — not to put a fine point on it — hated her.”
 Many in Grantham expect her critics will not wait long to make their mark, Newton added. “Either way, it’ll make a good story for the paper,” he said.
 Culture wars have been roiling around statues since 2017, when officials in Charlottesville, Virginia, said they would remove a statue memorializing Robert E. Lee, the Confederacy’s top general. But voices calling for the removal of statues associated with slavery and colonialism have grown steadily louder this year, particularly since the killing of George Floyd and the resurgent Black Lives Matter movement.
 In England, some have taken matters into their own hands. A monument to Edward Colston, a 17th-century slave trader, was toppled in Bristol in June during a Black Lives Matter protest.
 That same month, a protester in London scrawled “racist” on a statue of Winston Churchill, an ardent imperialist who once said it was right for “a stronger race, a higher-grade race” to claim territory from another. (He is also widely regarded as Britain’s greatest prime minister for his leadership in World War II.) The statue was boarded up to prevent further damage, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter that it was “absurd and shameful” that Churchill’s statue was at risk of attack.
 As in the United States, where a statue of Abraham Lincoln was considered fair game for protesters in Portland, Oregon, a wide range of monuments now seems more vulnerable to attack. And while it is unusual for a statue of a woman — a rarity itself — to attract such strong emotions, this was always the way with Thatcher.
 Internationally, Thatcher, who died in 2013 at age 87, may be seen as a political colossus, the British equivalent of Ronald Reagan. But in Britain, her 11 years in power have a more complicated legacy.

Rize Valisi Kemal Çeber'in katıldığı İl Genel Meclisi toplantısında Rize İl Özel İdaresi 2021 Yılı Mali Bütçesi 96 Milyon TL olarak belirlendi.
   
 İl Özel İdaresi 2021 Yılı Mali Bütçesi görüşmelerinin yapıldığı İl Genel Meclisi Kasım ayı olağan toplantıları, Meclis Başkanı İbrahim Türüt başkanlığında yapılan son birleşimle tamamlandı.

 Kasım ayı boyunca Plan Bütçe Komisyonunun diğer ihtisas komisyonları, ilgili kurum müdürleri ve İl Özel İdaresi birim müdürleriyle yaptığı çalışmalar neticesinde İl Özel İdaresi 2021 yılı mali bütçesine son şekli verildi.

 Meclis Üyelerinin görüşlerinin alınmasının ardından meclis oylamasına sunulan 96 Milyon TL'lik Plan Bütçe Komisyon raporu oy birliği ile kabul edildi.
   
 Meclis Başkanı İbrahim Türüt, bütçeyle ilgili yaptığı konuşmada, 2021 yılındaki yatırım faaliyetlerini şekillendirecek bir aylık bütçe çalışmalarını tamamladıklarını belirterek “Meclis olarak, seçildiğimiz ilk günden itibaren tek gayemiz köylerimizdeki yaşam kalitesini arttırmak ve çağımızın gereklerine uygun hizmetler yapmaktır. Bu hedefler doğrultusunda köylerimizde sürdürdüğümüz Beton, Asfalt, Taş Duvar, Parapet Duvar ve Menfez gibi tüm altyapı hizmetlerimizin yanında turizm başta olmak üzere eğitimden spora, sağlıktan tarıma kadar birçok kültürel ve sosyal içerikli hizmetlerin de içerisinde yer alamaya çalışıyoruz. Bu yıl ülkemizi ve tüm dünyayı saran Covid 19 salgınına rağmen pandemi kuralları çerçevesinde gerekli önlemlerimizi alarak hedeflediğimiz çalışmaları büyük oranda tamamladık ve yıl sonuna kadar tamamlamaya devam edeceğiz. KÖYDES projesinden gelen ödenekler hariç 2020 yılını kendi öz bütçemiz ve yatırımcı kurumlarımızın bütçeleriyle yaklaşık 250 Milyon TL ödenekle kapatıyoruz. Bu rakamın gelecek yıl daha yukarılara ulaşacağı öngörüsüyle planlamalarımızı o yönde sürdürüyoruz” dedi.

Önerilerimi söyledim ve bazı konularda meclis üyelerimizle fikir alışverişinde bulundum. Genel anlamda diğer benzerlerimizle kıyaslandığımızda rahatlıkla en iyilerden biri olduğumuzu ifade edebiliyorum. Bu tabloyu herkes görüyordur. Rize ili her konuda en iyisi olmak zorundadır. Hepimiz bunun için mücadele ediyoruz. Rize ailesi diye bir kavramı artık herkes benimsemiş durumda. Göreve başladığım ilk gün ben söylemiştim; her konuda dümene geçmeye hazırım ama yalnız başıma bir şey yapmamı kimse benden bir şey beklemesin. Tüm kurumlarımız beraber olmak durumda. Kamu kurumlarının birlik ve beraberlik içerisinde çalışma anlamında iyi bir yol kat ettiğimizi düşünüyorum. Bütün kaymakam ve kurum arkadaşlarıma hep şunu söylüyorum; ilçeler ve köylerde yapılacak olan faaliyetlerde mutlaka il genel meclis üyelerinin fikri alınacak. Muhtarlarımız, il genel meclis üyelerimiz ve kurumlarımız bir iş öncesinde birlik içerisinde olmalıdır” diye konuştu.

The title I chose at the time, “De-Dudeing Socialism”, is not one I would pick now. It was intended to smooth the rough edges of talking about feminism and women’s relationship to radical politics in an environment where such talk was equally derided as too liberal or too facile to be worth engaging with. It was intended, of course, to draw the attention of the exact men for whom tokenising women had become a political routine, to convince them that I was on their side and would ultimately not challenge too many of their ongoing practices. It is, then, no surprise that the line most people highlighted in the piece was not about my actual recommendations for making the left more hospitable for women, but about liberals forcing women to answer for men’s behaviour. Several years on, that particular brand of liberal antagonism seems to have largely petered off, making it all the more upsetting that so little has fundamentally changed for women in left organising (at least, I should specify, in Britain).

The concluding 18 holes on Sunday (today) will decide who finally get selected to represent the country in the Nick Faldo Golf Series in Vietnam in March next year. In the girls section, Parkha Ijaz of Defence Raya appears the most skilled in under-21 age bracket, while Humna Amjad of PAF Skyview Golf Club is certainly in a position to emerge as the best one in under-16 bracket.
 Parkha Ijaz was the eminent one in the second round. Her round of gross 67, five under par reflects remarkable golf playing skills and excellent control over the flow of the competition. With seven birdies, three coming in a sequence on holes 1, 2 and 3, slightly upset by a double bogie on the 12th hole, she ended the two rounds with an aggregate score of 144 (level par). Placed 18 strokes behind her is Suneyah Osama (PAF Skyview) who can only hope to end up as runner up.
 In under 16 years group, the best one is Humna Amjad (AGC) with a score of gross 159 and two strokes behind her is Abiha Syed also of AGC.
 In boys under-16 group, S Yashal Shah took over the top slot on the leader board with a stirring round of gross 73 in the second round. His aggregate score now is 151 and he is five strokes ahead of his adversary Omar Khalid. Third placed in this age bracket is Abdul Moeez at 160. Twelve years old M Ashass of AGC is placed fourth.
 In command in the under-18 years selection race is the consummate Damil Ataullah. His second round score was again a gross 74 and that added to his 74 of the first round gives him an aggregate of 148, four over par. The nearest challenger, Mekayl Majid, is at a score of 152.
 In the under-21 race, Nouman Ilyas improved his position with a deft round of gross 73 and now stands at an aggregate score of 152, thirteen strokes ahead of his nearest opponent Usama Nadeem of IBEX Golf Club, Sargodha.

 "A team that gets slightly better will have a big edge on where the title goes, so we want to be in there, which we are, and if we get six points in the next two games it puts us right in the mix.
 “It’s a long way to the end still, but third is not a bad position. Of course we would love to be unbeaten, winning all our games, but we lost two in a row against Partick Thistle and Dumbarton, so to be where we are whilst losing two in a row is not too bad.
 "We've also had to juggle a lot of injuries, a lot of knocks here and there, in the last fortnight, so the players have had to adapt to that as well."

I spent a couple of decade working professionally on energy-related issues, both for major industry players and a conservation-oriented nonprofit and for local communities impacted by development. Some of my time on the City Council was spent dealing with proposed drilling in Grand Junction’s Kannah Creek watershed that prompted the city’s then-controversial Watershed Protection Ordinance. Here’s what I’ve been thinking about while digesting the new rules and their impacts.
 That industry operators will be subject to a sea-change in regulatory emphasis come January is primarily a product of their own “Chicken Little” approach toward previous incremental attempts at rules changes.
 The sky was always supposed to fall if even the most minor alterations to air and water quality regulations, drilling and production procedures, bonding and reclamation requirements etc. were implemented. What I’ve described over the years as a “because we can” attitude often disregarded or paid lip service to concerns of neighbors and impacted communities.
 The fact that the industry is on the ropes right now, that one of northwest Colorado’s major players is being sold out of bankruptcy for less than 20 cents on the dollar and only a handful of rigs are drilling in the state, simply cannot be blamed on regulatory changes.

Sydney [Australia], November 29 (ANI): After scoring back-to-back centuries against India, Australia batsman Steve Smith said a changed batting approach has been yielding better results for him in the ongoing series.   Smith is now 'batting with more finesse' rather than hitting the ball hard. He smashed a 104-run knock off 64 balls and was awarded player of the Match.   Australia posted a mammoth total of 379/4 in their 50 overs as the top-five batsmen scored half-centuries for the team after openers David Warner (83) and Aaron Finch (60) provided a flying start.   The hosts won the game by 51 runs and gained a 2-0 unassailable lead in the three-match series.  
 "I felt good from ball one. It was another great foundation set by Finch and Davey. It's just summing up conditions and what's in front of you. Against India, you need to score big totals. Fortunately, it's come off. I am batting with more finesse now and that's worked. Tried to slog the balls hard a couple of weeks ago. It (records) doesn't bother me, nice to score some runs for the team. The boys were outstanding in the field too," Smith said at the end of the game.   India was behind the eight-ball right from the start of the chase, and it was only Virat Kohli (89) and KL Rahul (76) who could salvage some pride with the bat in hand. In the end, Australia wrapped up an easy win by 51 runs.   Earlier, Steve Smith and David Warner played knocks of 104 and 83 respectively as Australia posted a total of 389/4 against India. Opting to bat first, Australia once again got off to a flier as Warner and Aaron Finch hammered the Indian bowlers all around the park. Both batters went past their 50-run mark and the duo stitched together a partnership of more than 100 runs for the third consecutive time in ODI cricket.   In the final eight overs, Labuschagne and Maxwell added 93 more runs to Australia's total and as a result, the side posted a total of more than the 380-run mark. Labuschagne was dismissed after playing a knock of 70 runs while Maxwell remained unbeaten on 63.   The final and third ODI of the series will be played at Manuka Oval, Canberra on Wednesday, December 2. (ANI)

“Aseefa will be present on the occasion to represent the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who has contracted Covid-19 and has isolated himself in Karachi,” former PPP Senator Sehar Kamran told The News when contacted.
 She said although Bilawal will be addressing the rally via video link from Karachi, Aseefa’s physical presence will quash unnecessary speculation that the PPP has even slightly distanced itself from the event. “We don’t want to give rise to needless speculation and rumours.”
 However, Sehar Kamran denied that Aseefa’s participation amounted to her formal launch in politics. “She has already been taking part in various political activities. Since she is the daughter of Benazir Bhutto, she has to be a Benazir.”
 Much before Bilawal had taken a formal plunge into politics, Asif Ali Zardari had repeatedly talked about his son’s involvement in politics and his future stewardship of the PPP. As Bilawal completed his studies, he jumped into the political arena and has since been active to revive the PPP in areas where it has suffered losses.
 Some time ago, the family patriarch, Asif Zardari, seemed to have taken a decision that Bilawal will run the PPP while Aseefa will assist him in politics where needed. However, his elder daughter, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, would stay away from politics. For this reason, Bakhtawar has not been seen at political events organised by the PPP for a long time.
 After Zardari’s illness and earlier incarceration, Bilawal has been spearheading the PPP almost single-handedly.
 He alone ran the party’s campaign for the general elections to the Gilgit- Baltistan Legislative Assembly where the PPP stood first in terms of number of popular votes among all the political parties.
 In his lifetime, especially when he was behind bars during General Ziaul Haq’s regime, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had also patronised and groomed Benazir Bhutto from amongst his children to come into politics at a very difficult time for the party as well as for the Bhutto family. Although Begum Nusrat Bhutto was the formal chair of the PPP during his imprisonment, Benazir Bhutto had effective control over the party not only during the martial law period but subsequently as well.
 Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had kept his two sons and other daughter away from politics. Murtaza Bhutto did eventually form his own political party but he could not get much room in the political field compared to his sister, who became prime minister twice. She was all set to win the parliamentary polls once more to become the prime minister for a third time but was tragically assassinated as she was leaving the venue of her campaign rally in Liaquat Bagh, Rawalpindi.
 In view of this family history, if Aseefa formally joins politics from the PPP platform it will not be a surprising development.

Of course, there's some wiggle room in that formula. If you intend to maintain a very frugal lifestyle in retirement, you might get away with living on just 50% or 60% of your former income. And on the flipside, if you're hoping to travel a lot in retirement and live it up, you may need _more_ than 80% of your previous wages. But either way, Social Security alone probably won't cut it, so rather than assume that those benefits will pay the bulk of your bills as a senior, plan on having them cover a portion of your retirement costs -- and save enough to pay for the rest.

 First thing if the people give BJP a chance this poll is to “remove all the encroachments” on the stormwater drains and lake beds which had caused the recent floods, he said and charged the TRS-Majlis alliance of allowing them to come up due to “appeasement” politics. “We assure good governance in improving the civic infrastructure to make Hyderabad truly a global city and an international IT hub where youth from across the country will get employment opportunities,” said Mr. Shah.
 Refuting the charge of Centre not releasing funds for flood relief, he claimed ₹500 crore has been released and KCR was not aware since “he does not go to the Secretariat.” The Home Minister also had a series of questions to KCR — who he accused of not stepping out of his house to console people in distress — on the forgotten promises made in the last elections like roads, water, drains, public healthcare, etc., in last five years.
 KCR should openly declare the alliance with Majlis in public rather than have a “secret” understanding, he said and also questioned if there was “no talent” outside the first families which garners all the posts. Mr. Shah declared he was ready to take action against the illegal Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants if Majlis MP Asaduddin Owaisi seeks it in writing. “Everyone must have seen in TV who protests the most in Parliament when we talk about taking such action,” he pointed out.
 Earlier, Mr. Shah arrived by a special plane from New Delhi to the Begumpet airport where he was received by Union Minister of State G. Kishan Reddy, national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, national OBC president K. Laxman, TS party president B. Sanjay Kumar and others.
 Party activists gave him a rousing reception lining up all along the road till his motorcade reached the Bhagyalakshmi Temple at Charminar where he held prayers along with Goshamahal MLA T. Raja Singh, and others.
 From there, Mr. Shah moved to Warasiguda where he participated in the road show on the last day of the campaigning for the capital’s local body which got national attention with the BJP getting top leaders from across the country to take part in the electioneering.

 The applicant’s counsel submitted that the alleged contemnors had not been complying with the court directives despite the lapse of three months, and sought action against them.
 A division bench of the SHC headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar issued notices to the alleged contemnors and called their comments on the petition.
 The petitioners had sought the enforcement of different sections of the Sindh Covid-19 Emergency Relief Ordinance 2020 whereby some relaxations and concessions were allowed to the students of different educational institutions in Sindh during the pandemic.
 The petitioners had submitted in the petition that despite clear provisions in the ordinance, various educational institutions were not implementing the law and charging 100 per cent fee from their students in violation of the beneficial provisions contained in the law.
 The petitioners’ counsel had argued that despite a clear order passed by the court in presence of the advocate general, various educational institutions were still violating the ordinance and not implementing the law in letter and spirit.
 The private schools DG undertook that necessary action shall be taken across the board. He had assured that he would strictly implement the law and take action against the violations.
 A provincial law officer had submitted that the petition had been filed for the proper implementation of the law, and hence he had no objection if the petition was allowed. He further stated that the Sindh Covid-19 Emergency Relief Ordinance, 2020, had become an Act, which would be notified in official gazette.
 The court had by consent disposed of the petition with direction to the Dirpis DG to implement the law in all the educational institutions in Sindh and submit the first compliance report within 20 days.
 The high court observed that although it was the responsibility of the Dirpis DG, being the competent authority, to implement the law, however, the parents may also lodge their individual complaints to the DG’s office so that the officer could take action strictly in accordance with the law.

The model for challenging the elites on all this has been provided in spades by Greta Thunberg, and the movement she has led. This was to demand that they act to reverse this situation and reject their excuses for not doing so. This is the stance we must take in Glasgow next year – demand that they act. Environmentalists are right to point out that governments can make major changes fast when they decide to do so – for example, wage war. They can transform their economies within months. The Covid crisis itself has also taught us is that governments can find vast sums of money when they decide to do so.
