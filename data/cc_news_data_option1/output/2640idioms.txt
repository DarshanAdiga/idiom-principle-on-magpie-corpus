Pity the poor culture warrior, their mental gymnastics burning far more calories than pre-corona gym sessions ever could.      A statue was torn down, and they demanded people follow the proper channels. Statues were taken down via the “proper channels”, and they decried the panicked response. Reviews were announced to avoid a panicked response, and they raged against the reviews. When all else fails, they just conjure controversy out of thin air.      Take the Telegraph. Last week it claimed that the future of a 22-year-old statue of the Roman emperor Constantine outside York Minster was being “looked at”, after church officials “received complaints that the Roman emperor supported slavery”. The story was then picked up by the Daily Mail.      There was one problem. York Minster swiftly clarified it had not received a single complaint about the statue, and ruled out removing it.      This is part of a pattern. Shortly after Edward Colston’s statue was torn down in Bristol, Boris Johnson played up the threat to the Westminster statue of Winston Churchill. Hardly anyone was calling for its removal, but Johnson made it the centre of his response to the Black Lives Matter protests, and the Telegraph duly plastered it across the front page.      Write-ups of the Churchill statue also focused on the role of London mayor Sadiq Khan, a go-to hate figure on the nationalist right. This tactic was repeated recently, when newspapers roped Meghan Markle into their coverage of Prince Harry’s “support for a ban” (actually a review that almost certainly won’t lead to a ban) of the song Swing Low, Sweet Chariot by the Rugby Football Union.      The drivers of this dynamic are not hard to identify. Black Lives Matter is a movement, larger and broader than the organisations that bear its name. It challenges the privileges of the majority who do not experience racism, and the image that majority has of Britain and its history. And some of that majority take at least some of the movement’s arguments on board - while others lash out against it.      Those who lash out are less numerous than you might imagine. Polling conducted days after Colston’s statue was removed found most respondents agreed with the stated aims of the Black Lives Matter movement. Only 15% disagreed – around one in seven. Respondents were more evenly divided on the removal of slavery- related statues, and displayed outright hostility to removing Westminster’s Churchill statue.      But the one in seven who oppose even Black Lives Matter’s broad aims are overrepresented in the rightwing press, on talk radio and the broader network of rage merchants on social media. The organisations they work for claim to represent the unheard British majority, but they do not. They are aghast at the concept of structural racism, which implicates people and institutions far beyond their comfort zone of condemning neo-Nazis and football thugs.      Their interests are not served by tackling racialised economic inequality. The notion that unequal outcomes have structural causes affronts their smug certainty that it’s all about “personal responsibility”. And, of course, their bottom lines are not harmed by whipping up rage.      The problem is that they cannot win fighting against the basic principles of this movement because the public are broadly in favour of them. So their answer is to focus on what people are against, find examples of that, no matter how tenuous, and use them to discredit an entire political project.      The irony is that these critics of Black Lives Matter call it divisive. Given that the campaign challenges Britain’s self-image, its understanding of its history, and structural discrimination against a minority, what is notable is how little division it has provoked – contrast the support for BLM in both the US and the UK to the widespread antipathy towards Martin Luther King in the United States of the 1960s. It makes angry people very angry, but they are in the minority.      Instead, it is supporters of the populist right who are desperate to stoke division by reducing issues of fundamental importance to ephemeral noise and fake news. Their careers, and their ideology, depend on it.

Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers president Gay Culverhouse passed away from an aggressive form of leukemia on July 1.
   
 Three weeks ago, she told me that doctors at the Mayo Clinic told her she might have three months to live, but in reality, she survived only one month.
   
 Gay was a good friend of mine and had so many ties to LSU even though she attended the University of Florida and Columbia University.
   
 Culverhouse's mother was the first female golfer on the LSU golf team because they had no woman's golf program at that time. Two of Gay's grandchildren currently attend LSU and every time she would call me over the last few years she would start the conversation with "How's Coach O doing in recruiting?"
   
 When LSU defeated Alabama in November, it was Gay Culverhouse who was the first to call me as I was waiting to do pregame coverage for WWL-TV Channel 4 and she counted down the final seconds of the contest and let out this loud yell of excitement.
   
 Culverhouse was a frequent guest of "The Second Guess Show" on WWL 870-AM on Monday nights with Bobby Hebert and I and she was very colorful and opinionated.
   
 And behind the scenes, Culverhouse was involved in numerous charities in Louisiana and would ask for information on worthy charities she had heard about in the area. But she never wanted her name attached to the money she would give. She just wanted to help out the folks in Louisiana and also became a huge advocate for player benefits for older NFL players suffering with traumatic brain issues and head injuries and out of her own pocket was paying for nursing care for former players who could not have afforded it and were getting no help from the National Football League.
   
 I asked Gay to give me her thoughts on the best teams in the NFC and AFC leading up to the 2020 season in mid-May.
   
 "The Saints and the San Francisco 49ers are the best teams in the NFC," Culverhouse said. "Seattle is a very good team too, especially at home, but New Orleans and the 49ers are the top teams in the NFC. Tampa Bay will be a better team and a playoff team with Tom Brady and they will have a very improved defense. Brady will not turn the ball over like Jameis Winston did with those receivers and tight ends. But the Saints have a better offensive line, better units on special teams and they have Sean Payton. Coaching matters in any league. Bill Belichick is in a class of his own, like him or not, but right below him are Sean (Payton) and Andy Reid in Kansas City."
   
 "In the AFC, Patrick Mahomes in Kansas City and Lamar Jackson in Baltimore make those two teams contenders for the next 10 years if they can stay healthy," Culverhouse said. "I would watch for the Denver Broncos this season. Vic Fangio is an excellent defensive coach. The Broncos have loaded up at wide receiver and tight end and the young kid (Drew Lock) can play. Lock has got some special skills as a passer."
   
 Culverhouse went on to tell me about going to college to be in education, but when her dad offered her a position with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, she could not turn him down.
   
 "I went to school to be a part of the educational system, but my dad (Hugh Culverhouse) gets awarded the Tampa Bay expansion franchise and he told me to put aside those teaching ambitions and work for him. I started working for the Buccaneers in 1975 and we started play in 1976. I was involved in community relations to sell pro football in the Tampa area and to bring professional sports to the community. I really enjoyed it, but I had no idea what I was doing at first. And the way we played the first two years, I wasn't the only one not knowing what to do.
   
 "We were an expansion team with limited talent. My father was a very impatient man and we had a great coach in John McKay, who had tremendous success at Southern California, but he had never coached in the NFL and I'm not sure he didn't have better talent at USC than he had in Tampa the first two years. We were 0-14 in Year 1 and we were bad. We had players coming in and out daily. Year #2 was different."
   
 "We had Lee Roy Selmon who I think was the greatest Tampa Bay Buccaneer ever and our defense was really good, but our offense stunk," Culverhouse said. "We lost games 13-3, 9-3, 10-0, 13-0, 16-7 and so we had the defense, but nothing working on offense. Coach McKay was not use to losing and every night on "The Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson he would make jokes about us. Coach McKay took that personally because he knew Johnny very well and had appeared on his show numerous times. It was miserable."
   
 Culverhouse brought up that memorable first win against the Saints in 1977.
   
 "As a franchise we go (0-26) and play the New Orleans Saints next," Culverhouse said. "My dad went all out to get John McKay from USC to be our head coach, but if things hadn't worked out with Coach McKay, my dad would have hired Hank Stram to be our first coach. He had great respect for Hank. Archie Manning made a comment about being embarrassed if any team became the first team to lose to the Buccaneers. Others had made that comment before and if the Saints had won it wouldn't have been much of anything, but we go to New Orleans and win. First win ever for the Buccaneers (33-14) over the Saints. We could have walked back on foot to the airport in New Orleans. When that plane took off the party started. The players were dancing in the aisle along with the coaches and my dad. When we got back to Tampa there were 8,000 to 9,000 folks waiting for us at the facility, it melted my heart. So I tell my dad, "Let's be gracious about this and send Johnny Carson a gameball and you have to call Hank (Stram) and talk to him. The owner (John Mecom, Jr.) of the Saints has no clue to what he was doing. Hank told my dad he had spoken to Mecom and the owner knew the Saints were building a team for the future. Next week we play the St. Louis Cardinals and we win that game too (17-7) and the owner of the Cardinals, Bill Bidwell, and he wasn't any better than Mecom, fires their head coach Don Coryell after they had three consecutive seasons with double-digit wins. We finally were on the right track, but those wins got Coryell fired and then weeks later Hank Stram fired."
   
 Rest well Gay. It was great to share time and memories with you.

Ellender High School senior football player TyShaun Hester said family means the world to him.
   
 During his college recruiting process, he wanted to go somewhere that treated him like family.
   
 Hester, a running back, said he found that place not far from his home when he committed to play at Nicholls State University on June 25. He announced his commitment on his Twitter page.
   
 By going to Nicholls, Hester said it will give him a chance showcase his amazing athletic talent right in his backyard. He'll get to play for Nicholls coach Tim Rebowe and the two-time defending Southland Conference champion Colonels.
   
 "It's real close to home," Hester said. "It wouldn't be hard for my peers and family to come watch me play also I love the program that they have installed right there in Thibodaux. The coaches also made me feel welcomed from the day they offered me."
   
 Nicholls gave Hester his first offer on Feb. 19. He also had interest from Lamar University, Louisiana-Lafayette, McNeese State and other colleges.
   
 Despite going down with a serious foot injury during his junior football year, Hester said Nicholls remained interested and never neglected him.
   
 Nicholls running backs coach Sammy Joseph and tight ends coach Russ Gisclair kept close contact with Hester throughout his entire injury setback, which ultimately played a major role in his decision to commit to the Colonels.
   
 "I'm real blessed," Hester said. "The fact that they offered me the day after I had my surgery showed that they really believed in me and realized that I'd come back harder than ever."
   
 Before his injury last year, Hester tore it up on the football field, generating over 800 all-purpose yards and 10 touchdowns as a running back and kick returner. He broke his foot (fifth metatarsal) during a game against Morgan City and missed the final four games of the regular season. He is also a basketball player at Ellender and missed the majority of that season.
   
 "It was real tough," Hester said. "It definitely hurt me a lot but mostly my team. It also hurt a little of my recruitment. I had my team on my back before I went out and it just feel like I failed them."
   
 Now Hester, who stands at 5-foot-10 and weighs 187 pounds, has completely recovered from his injury and he is ready to light up area football fields this fall. He has dedicated himself at summer workouts with the Patriots and has worked with Camp Moula's Ernest Harvey this offseason.
   
 His goal is to help Ellender bounce back from a 2-8 season last year.
   
 The Patriots are also being led by first-year head coach Jesse Turner, who previously worked as the team's offensive coordinator last year. Turner is also a former Ellender High and Nicholls State running back.
   
 "The people and community can expect and whole new program," Hester said. "Just from our summer workouts, you can see it's not the same Ellender. We have something to prove. I love working with Coach Turner. I wouldn't rather any other head coach at this time. He knows the game in and out. He's played at the highest division of football. He was also my offensive coordinator, so I am very familiar with him. It's a different Ellender football this upcoming year. Believe me."
   
 Hester said he is motivated to get back time lost from his injury last year and missing spring football due to the coronavirus shut down this year.
   
 Without both setbacks, Hester said he feels he would've received more interest from other major college programs, so during his senior season, he is ready to show them what they missed out on.
   
 "I feel as if I have some making up to do so I'll definitely double the numbers I would've got last year this year," Hester said.
   
 Hester said it is great that he will follow in Turner's footsteps as a running back at Nicholls.
   
 "It's coincidence now that he can really give me the in and outs of playing at the college level," Hester said.
   
 Turner said it was a great feeling when he learned about Hester's commitment to Nicholls.
   
 "The day before he committed, we sat down and we talked a little bit," Turner said. "He said 'Coach, I think I'm going to commit to Nicholls.' It's very exciting. It's close to home. His family can go watch him play. He's wanted for this moment to play for a college program, especially like Nicholls, who have won a lot of games in the last couple of years. I think he made a wise decision. I can't wait to see him play at Nicholls."
   
 Turner said Ellender lost a major weapon when Hester went down with his foot injury last year. Although his athletic talents were missed, Turner said the Patriots lost a key leader on the field.
   
 "The most important thing we missed from him is leadership. He always wanted to be that guy," Turner said. "He never shied away from it. That's something I love about him. He's going to work to get to that point. I'm glad to have him back. He's healthy. He's ready to ball out. It was definitely tough to lose him last year."
   
 With Hester back for his senior year, Turner said he believes will show great improvement on the football field this fall.
   
 "I want to see him help bring Ellender back to a place where we haven't been in a long time," Turner said. "With his leadership and his ability, he could do that."
   
 When he gets to Nicholls, Hester said he will work hard to gain playing time early in his college career.
   
 "I got recruited to Nicholls for running back but I'm really versatile so I think they might try me at slot also," Hester said. "I'm that missing piece for Nicholls in the future. When I get there, they will have two senior backs so I'll probably be third string behind them but I'll get there and work and try to getting playing time as fast as possible."
   
 Turner said the Patriots have used Hester all over the field. He plays as a running back first, but they've used him as a quarterback, receiver and kick returner.
   
 "He can play all over," Turner said. "He's a very good kick returner for us. We're going to use him all over the field. With the way he's moving, I think Coach Rebowe and those guys are going keep him at running back and I think he's going to do really well over there."
   
 Hester, the son of Travis Hester and Latosha Williams, isn't the only member of his household to get a shot at playing college sports.
   
 His sister -- Trastasha Hester -- is a former girls basketball standout at Ellender. She helped lead the Lady Patriots to a Class 4A state championship in 2017 and she now plays college basketball at LSU-Eunice.
   
 Hester said he has a great relationship with his older sister. He credits his parents for teaching them the importance of hard work, dedication and discipline.
   
 "It's feels good definitely for my parents," Hester said. "They love to see us go to that next level and my sister is a great athlete. I'm just glad I get to do the same."
   
 As always, Hester said he appreciates the support of his family and friends during his journey towards becoming a college football player.
   
 "I definitely want to thank Coach Jesse, my pops for always pushing for this opportunity for me, my mama and any of my peers that were there through the process," Hester said. "This is only the beginning. It's great knowing that those home games at Nicholls they can be right there in the stands to see me playing college ball."

But with a lack of guidance on social distancing in venues, Ms Gordon said it was "unable to fully plan when and how we can welcome people back".
 A two-metre rule meant its auditorium would fill about 18% of its capacity, rising to 25%-30% with a one-metre rule, so it would not be financially viable to reopen in the usual way.
 A recent survey found 17% of people would feel comfortable returning to events, so theatres need a "careful balance of everything" as they would "not only be dealing with a reduced capacity, but a reduced appetite to attend", she said.
 "But with a rise of localism in the future, more home working and less commuting, regional theatres will have a big role economically in rebuilding our towns and also in providing a key place for the community to come together, tell stories, rebuild and gain confidence."
 A government spokesman said: "We want to get the performing arts fully back up and running safely as soon as possible and are working closely with the sector on a phased approach, guided by public health and medical experts."

Making Kasabian's next album For Crying Out Loud "probably saved my life", Meighan later admitted to the NME.
 "It was just an escape for Tom to go, 'This is my band and these tunes are exciting,'" said his bandmate Pizzorno. "Being in the studio made him realise the good things that were going on."
 Just a couple of weeks ago, Meighan said work had commenced on Kasabian's seventh album.
 "We need a seventh baby," he told Sky News. "We're going to try and make a new record as soon as we can but we can't really do anything while we're restricted."
 That interview suggests Meighan's departure from the band has been relatively abrupt. There is no indication on whether they will continue as a three-piece or hire a new frontman.

Pedestrian foot overbridges are sparsely used compared to the at-grade crosswalks in Indian cities. At the signalised intersections, in the presence of at-grade crosswalk, the usage rate of foot overbridge is even less despite the additional pedestrian waiting time. The uneven utilization of the crossing facilities affects the safety and mobility of pedestrians. The objective of this study is to analyse the behaviour of pedestrians and their choices between an at-grade signalised crosswalk and a coexisting foot overbridge (which is quite common in Indian cities) for crossing the street. The actual crossing choice behaviour of 1134 pedestrians was observed from a video survey in Mumbai city, India. The usage rate of foot overbridge in the sample was 26% only. Binary logit model was estimated to find the significant variables influencing the pedestrian choice of crossing facility. The results showed that pedestrian's total crossing time ratio (ratio of crossing time by foot overbridge to total crossing time by at-grade crossing which includes additional waiting time at signal) affects the choice of crossing facilities significantly. The probability of selecting foot overbridge increases by about 60% as the pedestrian's total crossing time ratio reduces from 1.5 to 0.5, For more than 50% of pedestrians to use foot overbridge, the total crossing time ratio should be within 0.75. It was also inferred that choices of women and older pedestrians are influenced primarily by convenience to cross, whereas the choices of pedestrians accompanied by children are driven by the safety benefits of the crossing facility. Another important finding from the study was that pedestrians' crossing behaviour depends on the level of risk they take while crossing (in terms of signal violation). The conclusions from this study may be helpful in strengthening the policy measures in the direction of the design of safe and efficient pedestrian crossing facilities.

Survey and field studies conducted with commercial airline pilots suggest that in-flight sleepiness and related involuntary sleep phenomena are experienced by pilots during their duties. However, for methodological, practical and commercial reasons, there is a lack of publicly available research data of per-flight hour rates of sleepiness experienced by pilots or predicted fatigue risk rates associated with pilots' hours of work. This empirical field study sought to address this gap by collecting self-reported sleepiness/alertness ratings from pilots from 18 different UK airlines via a mobile phone app over the period of August 2017. In tandem, predicted sleepiness levels and sleep opportunities associated with participants' flown rosters were investigated using biomathematical fatigue modelling.      FINDINGS indicated that a quarter of all flying duty periods were predicted to be preceded by a main sleep opportunity shorter than six hours, whilst 10% of all flying hours were associated with elevated fatigue risk levels. Pilots reported 7.3 reports of involuntary sleep on the flight deck per 1000 flying hours, which represents a rate far greater than that previously reported to the regulator. By comparison, the rates of predicted and recorded fatigue- related incapacitations greatly exceeded the target rate of medical incapacitation permissible under the medical incapacitation safety standard for commercial aviation of less than one occurrence per 1,000,000 h.

With unprecedented restrictive protocols in place, fall sports for Fauquier County's three public high schools began organized preseason conditioning Monday.
 This week marks the first time any type of organized interscholastic athletics have been allowed in the county since on-campus classes and sports were suspended statewide March 13 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "I think some of the coaches were confused, believing they could come out and start like a normal practice," said Fauquier High trainer Bryan Grimley. "Really this is just to get the kids back on campus and start conditioning. This is not practice."
 "With all the restrictions, it's going to be tough on the coaches and players," said Fauquier activities director Mark Ott. "You know as soon as they get out there, they are going to want to start team drills. You can't do that.”
 Everyone will need to stay 10 feet apart, Grimley said, rather than the often cited six feet. He explained exercisers breathe more heavily, with the associated exhale plume able to travel farther.
 Each person will undergo a temperature screening each time and will need to answer a list of questions before being cleared for that day's workout. The questions will include whether the person is experiencing any symptoms or whether they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 infection.
 Once cleared, the athletes will assemble in pods of five to a maximum of 10 people. They will not be permitted to change pods during the session.
 Ott stressed no locker rooms or other indoor facilities will be used. Bathrooms will not be available unless an emergency arises, and participants must bring their own water supply. There will be no sharing of equipment.
 "We are not providing anything," Ott said of the school.
 "I feel our coaches will do the right thing, but how much can you actually do," Ott said, adding there will be monitoring to ensure adherence to the protocols.
 Every coach must contact the school's athletic director to schedule sessions. Schools will be limited to a maximum of 50 people on campus at any particular moment, inclusive of coaches.
 The opportunities are limited to football, cross country, field hockey, volleyball and sideline and competition cheerleading. Winter and spring sports teams are not permitted at this time.
 "Our priorities were to get the fall sports going," said Ott, emphasizing the strict limitation on capacity.
 Grimley noted some coaches were disappointed when told of the limitations at a recent training session.
 Grimley said Dr. David Jeck, Fauquier County Superintendent of Schools, allowed Fauquier, Kettle Run and Liberty high schools to commence conditioning sessions after the three school's athletic directors and trainers assembled a set of protocols consistent with guidelines from Centers for Disease Control, the Governor's office and Virginia Department of Health .
 "We came up with a policy together so every high school will be the same," Grimley said late last week.
