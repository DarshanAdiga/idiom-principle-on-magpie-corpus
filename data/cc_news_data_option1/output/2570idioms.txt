Honda
 Far and away, the CR-V crossover SUV was Honda's bestselling nameplate in 2019. Dealers moved 384,168 of them. The Civic family was the automaker's second bestselling model, though it fell short of that total by nearly 59,000 units. The CR-V proved to be more popular than the HR-V, Odyssey, Passport and Pilot put together. Combined sales of these nameplates were only 369,310 units.

"These guys can be the heart and soul of the team. We've got some kids that bring different things to the table and we'll ride the guy that's best and most productive. Each will have their shot and a chance. When it's your turn you do your thing, they need to be great teammates in the backfield. You look at the bigger programs like Alabama or somebody and they have multiple guys that can do a lot of things," Thomas said.

As a long time owner of a vacation rental property in Destin, I am saddened to see the beach chair rental companies taking over the best seating on our beautiful beaches.
   
 I am able to have sold-out dates on my rental calendar because potential rentals can see on my webpage my close proximity to those beautiful emerald waters. Imagine how frustrated they must be on their first day to the beach when they discover they must take a back seat to the plethora of rental beach chairs!
   
 We must all learn to share -- isn't that what we teach our children?
   
 Surely there could be a fair compromise between the rental companies and homeowners. Let's work together on this issue. We have all been cooped up for so long, and we all should be able to sit on the beach without hindrance of a view!

 COVID-19 heralds some good news for this Independence Day. We won't be facing heavy traffic. And, the scarcity of meat will keep our outdoor grills safe.
   
 Folks who grill hamburgers and hot dogs face a nasty choice. The U.S. Meat and Poultry Hotline advises grilling at high temperature to avoid food poisoning by E. coli and Salmo-nella bacteria. But the National Cancer Institute warns that high-temperature grilling of processed meats generates cancer-causing compounds.
   
 Fortunately, we no longer need to choose between food poisoning and cancer!
   
 A bunch of enterprising U.S. food processors have met this challenge head-on by developing a rich variety of convenient, healthful, delicious plant-based veggie burgers, veggie dogs, and soy nuggets.
   
 These products don't harbor nasty bugs or cancer-causing com-pounds. They are missing the cholesterol, saturated fats, drugs, hormones, and pesticides of their animal-based alternatives. And, they are waiting for us in the frozen food section of our favorite supermarket, along with nut-based ice creams, and other dairy-free des-serts.
   
 On this Independence Day, let's declare our independence from the meat industry, which exposes its workers to COVID infection. And, let's stay away from both the COVID and the barbecue bugs!

Turkey is another example. The country, which – in normal times – welcomes more than 50 million tourists a year, has more reason than most to encourage travellers to return. But last week it confirmed that Britons hoping to visit this summer will need to wear masks at all times while out and about (or face a £100 fine), including in public parks and while sunbathing on the beach. Because nothing beats basking in 35C heat while having your breathing restricted. That’s another country off my wishlist.

Biden said the tax cuts were "irresponsible, sugar-high tax cuts." He claimed, without evidence, that cutting taxes made it "harder to foot the bill" for pandemic relief. In fact, interest rates have declined while government spending on pandemic relief programs has skyrocketed.

Mazda
 Mazda is the little Japanese automaker that could. Despite being far smaller than rivals like Honda and Toyota, it sill manages to build some truly amazing products. Far and away, the Hiroshima-based firm's most-popular vehicle in 2019 was the surprisingly upscale and engaging CX-5 compact crossover SUV, which accounted for 154,545 sales. In comparison, the automaker's second-most- popular product, the Mazda3 sedan and hatchback, only racked up 50,741 deliveries. It's also worth noting, the CX-5 outsold all other Mazda models combined, and it did so by a whopping 30,538 units. Talk about a showroom- dominating product.

Certain vehicles are absolute cornerstones of their companies' lineup, accounting for huge percentages of their brand's overall sales. Take the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, for instance. Last year, Bowtie dealers pushed out nearly 439,000 of them, or more than the combined sales of Chevy's entire car range, which includes the Bolt, Camaro, Corvette, Cruze, Impala, Malibu, Sonic, Spark and Volt. Also, did you know the old Grand Caravan is Dodge's top-performing model? It's true! In 2019, this venerable minivan outperformed far sexier products like the Challenger, Charger and Durango. Over at Honda, the CR-V is far and away the brand's sales leader, outpacing the combined deliveries of several other light-truck models.
 Here's a compilation of the most popular new vehicle nameplates at every major automaker, as well as how their figures compare to the showroom performance of other models in a given brand's range. Some car companies avoid reporting sales, while others don't break them out by country. However, these are typically smaller, boutique firms like Ferrari or Aston Martin. Accordingly, they've been excluded from this list. Here's how everything shook out in 2019 (the most recent complete year of sales available) in sales for the good ol' US of A.

When it comes to cramped indoor environments, I’ll give masks the benefit of the doubt. On the rare occasions when I get the Tube, rather than cycle, I’ll wear one – if only out of courtesy for my fellow commuters. Should I go abroad, I’ll follow the same rule of thumb.

This is precisely why Miami's mayor has said he is ready to return the town to lockdown if present trends continue. At the moment, more than 50 percent of those over 2.6 million coronavirus instances in the united states are arriving from hotspot countries like Florida, Texas, and California -- with Florida, particularly, faring so relatively poorly right now throughout the coronavirus pandemic which reporters asked Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday if the state would go back into lockdown steps in light of placing record single-day levels of coronavirus infections. So far, over 152,000 supported cases and over 3,500 deaths, according to the newest statistics from Johns Hopkins University has been reported by the Sunshine State. That is the reason why, despite Gov. DeSantis' assurances to the contrary, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez comes with an entirely different mindset to the coronavirus film confronting his town -- going so far as to warn he's ready to return the city to lockdown if the situation does not change. Suarez advised Business Insider in an interview this week that the nation as a whole has been hammered right now by an influx of new coronavirus instances as a consequence of what he believes was a hurry to reopen the government in addition to lax compliance with matters like social distancing and wearing face masks."People found this was " Suarez, who also was a registered Republican, informed BI. "I can not talk for many Floridians, but… I was the final city to start in Florida and that I have criticized for this and that I think today people see the wisdom in our conservative strategy."He worries that if a crucial stage is reached by hospital ability, he ready to reintroduce a lockdown in Miami to impede the spread of this virus. That slowing has been tried through things such as the June 25 order requiring everyone pay a fine of between $50 and $500 or to wear a face mask of Suarez. It is something that the mayor compares toward wearing a seatbelt to the endorsement we've got."Should you wear a seat belt," he stated, "it will not make sure that you are not likely to get badly hurt if you've got an automobile collision, but it enhances your chances, and it is not a tough thing to do."

If you’d asked Ethan De Nolf a while back if he would ever open a coffee business, he would likely have said you’re nuts.
 “I never planned in my life to start a coffee company,” De Nolf, a barber by trade, said. “But when things work out a certain way, we have to roll with the punches and go with it.”
 Fewer than four months after opening inside De Nolf’s Barbershop at 435 S. Michigan St. in South Bend, Embassy Coffee Co. will move into a new location.

So absurd is New York’s embrace of the face mask that the city’s Health Department recently encouraged residents to wear them while having sex. “Make it a little kinky,” the guidelines said. “Be creative with sexual positions and physical barriers, like walls, that allow sexual contact while preventing close face-to-face contact.” Shagging through a wall. You couldn’t make it up. In short, New York is not a city I’m rushing to visit.
