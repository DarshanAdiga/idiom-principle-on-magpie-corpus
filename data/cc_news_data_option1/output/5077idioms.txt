WASHINGTON (AP) — As the U.S. government plows forward with its plan for lame-duck executions in the midst of a pandemic, the Justice Department disclosed that eight staff members who took part in an execution last month tested positive for the coronavirus and five of those staffers will take part in executions scheduled for this week.The disclosure that the execution team members had tested positive for the virus, in addition to the spiritual adviser of the inmate put to death, is furthering criticism from advocates and lawyers for inmates who say the Bureau of Prisons isn’t doing enough to stop the spread of exploding coronavirus cases behind bars. The prison where the executions are carried out, in Terre Haute, Indiana, is in the midst of a massive COVID-19 outbreak.“The fact that at least 20 percent of the BOP’s execution team has contacted COVID-19 following Orlando Hall’s execution speaks volumes — particularly given the fact that we don’t know how many team members opted in to be tested,” said Cassandra Stubbs, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Capital Punishment Project.In court filings, the Bureau of Prisons said eight members of the specialized execution team – a group of about 40 employees who are brought into the Indiana prison for executions – had tested positive for the virus shortly after the execution of Hall a few weeks ago.Only six members of the team opted to be tested for the virus before they left Terre Haute – and all tested negative, the agency said. But six others tested positive within a week and two more members of the team also tested positive a short time later.The Bureau of Prisons plans to bring back five of those employees to carry out two executions scheduled for this week, saying that such a decision is in line with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s unclear whether they could still be infectious, but the Bureau of Prisons said the guidance allows them to interact with other people because it is more than 10 days since the positive test. Two other team members, who the agency says “tested positive more recently,” will not attend the execution.This week, the Bureau of Prisons plans to carry out two more executions — of Brandon Bernard on Thursday and Alfred Bourgeois on Friday. Three other executions have been scheduled, some just days before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. And Attorney General William Barr told the AP he’s likely to schedule more before he leaves the Justice Department.A spokesman for Biden has said the president- elect opposes the death penalty and will work to end its use when he is in office.As of Tuesday, 264 inmates and 21 staff members at FCC Terre Haute, the federal prison complex where the executions are carried out, had confirmed positive cases for the virus. Two inmates who are not on death row at the prison are suing to try to delay the executions, arguing their lives could be at risk if the Bureau of Prisons continues to bring in dozens of people for each of the executions.For each execution, about 100 people are brought to the prison complex, including the execution team, additional personnel for security, witnesses and others.During a court hearing on Tuesday, a Justice Department lawyer, Jordan Von Bokern, said he didn’t know whether any of the execution team members had any contact with prison staff members who have tested positive for the virus. But he argued the Justice Department should be permitted to move forward with the executions, claiming the protocols in place are adequate and argued it isn’t possible to know how the staff members contracted the virus.“It is difficult to even make the assumptions they contracted it during the execution,” he said, arguing they could have been exposed at restaurants, stores or hotels.But health officials have long said prisons are a perfect storm of risk factors, poor circulation, poor social distance and a lack of personal protective equipment. As the virus surges outside the prisons, it also is surging inside.Since Nov. 6, the number of inmates currently infected and not yet recovered from the virus has increased by 165%, from 2,092 to 5,555. Over that same span, 17 inmates died of COVID-19.The Bureau of Prisons has struggled from the beginning to combat the coronavirus in the 122 federal prisons across the U.S. and inmates, advocates, lawyers and even correction officers have been sounding the alarm for months about what they say are inadequate policies to control the spread of the virus.The number of staff members with current positive tests surged by 79%, from 899 on Nov. 6 to 1,613 on Dec. 7, stretching an already threadbare workforce, according to the agency’s data. The federal prison system does not require employees to be tested for COVID-19, the agency’s director Michael Carvajal told Congress last week.“I can’t mandate somebody to take a test,” Carvajal said. “If I could, I’d be doing it already.”Late last month, a medium-security prison in Mendota, California, hit with a wave of suspected COVID-19 cases reassigned 23 non-corrections employees to work as correctional officers because of staffing shortages.All federal prison employees are trained as corrections officers, but one union official compared the practice known as “augmentation” to having a substitute teacher supervise a class of rambunctious children.“This is a dangerous and extremely unsafe practice,” said Aaron McGlothin, the president of the union at Mendota. “It is not a matter of if but a matter of when someone will get assaulted.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Pornography went wherever Americans went - in life and in death, at war and at sea. Men carved wooden pornographic objects at logging camps in the 19th century, and they made pornographic scrimshaw on whaling vessels during the 18th and 19th centuries. Others were inspired to refashion the 19th-century liberty penny that had "ONE CENT" written on the reverse side of the coin. By changing the "E" to a "U," many Americans had the same idea for rendering the coin obscene. Who knows how many pockets jingled with these pennies over the years?

Voy a contarte donde estaba yo entonces. Hace muchos años escribi un texto del que no he olvidado una sola coma. Lo aprendi de memoria por si algun dia mi enfermedad me permitia un momento de calma y podia transmitirtelo a ti o a tu padre. Yo he visto cosas que vosotros no creeriais. He visto a David Gahan hacer que decenas de miles de personas alzaran los brazos por encima de sus cabezas y los ondearan como las corrientes mueven las algas en el fondo marino, mientras Depeche Mode entonaba _Never let me down_. He visto a The Cure tocar _Charlotte sometimes_ y he saltado de emocion al reconocer los primeros compases de _Killing an arab_ durante su actuacion del 40 aniversario en Hyde Park. He chocado la mano con Brett Anderson en La Riviera, al tiempo que otras mil personas le acompañabamos en el estribillo de _New generation_. He visto a Paul McCartney subirse a un escenario en el Bernabeu y cantar _Yesterday_ y luego versionar _Something_ para dedicarsela a su amigo George Harrison. He visto a ACDC, con Brian Johnson y con Axl Rose. He visto en Barcelona la exposicion _David Bowie is_ con la misma emocion con que dos años antes viaje a Londres para adentrarme por primera vez en el universo intimo de un mito. He pisado el estudio de Paris donde Picasso pinto el Guernica y comido un Año Nuevo en La Coupole, en el mismo sitio donde el genio malagueño paraba a tomar cafe con Paquerette y Man Ray. Me he detenido ante la tumba de Jim Morrison, de mierda hasta arriba, en el cementerio de Pere Lachaise; besado el mausoleo de Oscar Wilde; acariciado la oronda forma testicular del periodista Victor Noir; y me he arrodillado ante las lapidas de Julio Cortazar, Emilio Zola y La Goulue en el camposanto de Montmartre. He paseado por el distrito de Kreuzberg en Berlin, he pisado el punto exacto del callejon londinense donde se fotografio la portada de _Ziggy Stardust_. He visto cientos de veces _El Padrino_ y memorizado sus dialogos mas alla de lo enfermizo. Asisti con mi madre al estreno de _Grease_ e hice que me llevara de nuevo a ver la pelicula en otras nueve sesiones de tarde en el mismo mes. Y ella vino conmigo. He estado en el entierro de Eduardo Benavente y visto llorar a Loquillo. He oido a Jaime Urrutia desgañitarse cantando _Obediencia_ en el Colegio Mayor Mendel y a un punk con una esvastica en el brazo en un concierto de Paralisis. He visto a Radio Futura tocar _Interferencias_ en el Rock Ola y a los punks escupiendo a German Coppini con Siniestro Total. He visto a Antonio Vega sobre un escenario poco antes de su fallecimiento y me he preguntado como alguien con la muerte en el rostro podia seguir pareciendo el genio que era. He visto volatilizarse hace 30 años a la peor generacion de politicos de la historia de España. He visto a este pais sucumbir al odio y la rabia y arruinarse en un par de ocasiones para volverse a levantar. He leido el Quijote dos veces y la _Biblia_ ninguna. He visto a Vargas Llosa estampando su firma en un ejemplar mio de _La ciudad y los perros_ y luego le he visto como parte del publico junto a la exmujer de Julio Iglesias en un programa de cocina. He visto a Camaron y a Jose Mari Manzanares riendose a pierna suelta en un camerino y he visto la puerta exterior de Le Bataclan llena de ramos de flores. He visto a punks y a heavies dandose de hostias en la Plaza de España y a _rockers_ y _mods_ haciendo lo propio en Arguelles. He visto un _rocker_ de raza negra con la bandera sudista cosida en su chaqueta. He visto fascinado el cuerpo menudo de Patti Smith. He visto a Miguel Rios y a Leño de gira por plazas de toros. He leido periodicos en los bares mientras una cucharilla centrifugaba el azucar en el interior de una taza de cafe. He visto y he oido. He visto _Blade Runner_ el año de su estreno. Y quiero seguir viendo todavia, pero me falta tiempo. No he visto, sin embargo, atacar naves en llamas mas alla de Orion. No he visto Rayos-C brillar en la oscuridad cerca de la puerta de Tannhauser, ni creo que haga falta. Todos esos momentos se perdieron en el tiempo como lagrimas en la lluvia despues del Covid19 del año 2020. He visto libros de Nietzsche apilados en cajas de mudanza, y entre esas paginas de libro de bolsillo, desgastado por el tiempo, he leido cosas. Siempre me quede con esta: "¿Es esto la vida?, le dire a la muerte. Pues que empiece otra vez".

While most businesses are hit by the ongoing pandemic, the healthcare market has seen a sudden rise in business and is expected to increase three-fold to Rs 8.6 trillion (US$ 133.44 billion) by 2022. The dependence on mobile technology and online services has increased manifold during the COVID-19 pandemic in almost every sector, including healthcare platforms too. While brands like Practo, Pharmeasy and Netmeds had already made their presence felt even before the pandemic, 2020 has really seen this set of brands come of age and affirm their meaningfulness to consumers. With online consultations and purchase of medication becoming the need of the hour during the COVID-19 outbreak, consumers are turning to these companies to address their needs.

DEDHAM, Mass. (AP) — A man already behind bars after being convicted of raping a woman in Massachusetts in 1996 has pleaded guilty to a second rape the same year. Ivan Keith, 62, who fled to Maine where he lived under an alias for years to avoid prosecution, was sentenced Wednesday in Norfolk Superior Court to up to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated rape and other charges in connection with a 1996 rape in Quincy, The Patriot Ledger reported. The sentence will be served at the same as an identical sentence he received in Plymouth County last month after pleading guilty to raping a woman in West Bridgewater in 1996. The victim in the second case, an administrator at Quincy High School, was bound with her own scarf and raped at gunpoint, prosecutors said. Keith’s attorney, Melissa Fournier, said her client was remorseful and didn’t want the victim to have to testify. Keith fled Massacusetts in 2003 and was was arrested in Seal Cove, Maine, in August 2019, in a house that belonged to his ex-wife, authorities said. He was linked to the rapes in Massachusetts through DNA evidence.

VC: As a writer, I’ve always tried to honor my own truth, whether that truth went against the grain or with the grain. I can’t and won’t be anyone else. I used to feel a lot of shame for not being like other people, but now I try harder to write what feels true to me. I used to think I was supposed to sound like other writers, but I think perhaps starting with my third book, I gave up on that. I just began to write what rang true to me instead of trying to be like everyone else. This wasn’t a conscious decision, it just happened. I think I grew up a little bit (finally). This doesn’t mean I don’t listen to feedback, though. I listen really closely to feedback from close friends who are kind enough to read my work. Sometimes, depending on what I’m working on, I need more feedback than other times. I think a writer needs many things, but persistence and a doggedness are two qualities that can be important. If I didn’t have these qualities, I don’t think I would have been able to survive the brutal literary world. I also think a writer needs to simply love writing. I do and always have. If I have nothing else, I know that I really like writing. As I get older and older, I am less afraid of writing about those harder things. The fear, though, is usually how others will perceive the writing or me. At some point, I have just accepted that poets in particular can be very harsh and judgmental. They won’t like hardly anything anyone writes anyway, so why bother trying to please them? I am more interested in pleasing myself.
