 HMSI is expected to introduce the Honda Forza range sometime next year, considering the response the Forza 300 got at the Honda Big Wing showroom in India. But even then, we expect the Forza 125, or at the most, the new Forza 350 to be offered on sale in India. Even if there's a Forza 750 in the works, it's unlikely to be introduced in India.

What is Outlook’s Daily Briefing?
 The Daily Briefing is a personalized email that Office constructs for you, based upon what Microsoft 365 (or Office) knows about you and your day. It’s an improved, email-based version of what Windows 10’s Cortana function used to do, providing you a pop-up view of your day. It’s also entirely dependent upon your administrator, who must decide whether to enable it—and, in my employer’s case, apparently allow it through the spam filter as well. You can turn the Daily Briefing on and off via Cortana.office.com.

FARGO, N.D. (AP) — A bill named for a Fargo murder victim to address cases of missing and murdered Native Americans is heading to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature. Savanna’s Act, which is named for Savanna Greywind, passed the House Monday after passing the Senate earlier this year. The bill was introduced by former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, of North Dakota, last Congress and was reintroduced by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, in the current Congress. The law establishes better law enforcement practices to track, solve and prevent crimes against Native Americans. It directs the Departments of Justice and Interior to consult with American Indian tribes while developing national law enforcement guidelines. The 22-year-old pregnant Greywind was murdered in 2017 and her unborn baby was cut from her body. Her remains were found in the Red River north of Fargo. Two people are in prison for her death. Her infant survived.

BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota’s top health official has lifted the state’s 14-day quarantine order for people returning from international travel. The quarantine order was issued in April and amended twice, most recently in July. Interim State Health Officer Dr. Paul Mariani said his decision follows the recommendation of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It’s important for North Dakotans to remember that individual countries may have their own restrictions that impact travel,” he said in a statement. “Check with your destination’s Ministry of Health for the most up-to-date information.” The U.S.-Canada border remains closed to nonessential travel due to the pandemic. North Dakota continued to build on record highs for active cases of the coronavirus and number of hospitalizations, according to state Department of Health figures released Monday. The update shows that the number of active cases grew by two in the last day, to a total of 3,210. The number of people currently receiving care in medical facilities rose by six, to 87. Officials reported one new death, a man in his 80s from Rolette County with underlying health conditions. The death toll stands at 193 since the pandemic began.
