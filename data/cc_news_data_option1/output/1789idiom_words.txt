Now about 6, Bina Wana had been scheduled to be freed soon as part of an ambitious program that has released more than 300 rescued Sumatran orangutans into the rainforest.


  But as with so many of his human cousins, Bina Wana’s freedom has been put on hold by the coronavirus.


  Scientists fear that the virus, which is thought to have originated in bats and jumped to humans, could just as easily jump to great apes — gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans — which share 97% to 99% of their DNA with people. All are highly endangered.


  If the virus were to infect even one wild ape, experts fear it could spread unchecked and wipe out an entire population. There would be no way to stop it in the wild.


  “We are worried about this and taking it very seriously,” said Ian Singleton, director of the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Program, which has been raising Bina Wana since his 2014 rescue. “If it happens, it will be a catastrophe.”
