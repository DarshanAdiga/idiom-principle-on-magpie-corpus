The former Southend Manor manager has stepped away from the coaching side of things at the club to move into the new role with the Foxes. And he revealed this has been in the pipeline for months as chairman Michael Foley was keen to hand the club over to help them move forward. "I'm absolutely delighted with this opportunity, it came a lot sooner than I anticipated, as people know that are close to me know I've always had an ambition to run or own a football club," Peek told the club's YouTube channel. "Probably not this soon as i'm still fairly young in my management career, but sometimes an opportunity comes along that you just need to grab, and this i felt was too good not to grab. "This club has a massive history, it had some challenges over the last couple of years, but it helps that it has big potential so what a place to start. "Hopefully over the next couple of years i'll be able to move the club in the right direction and get it back to its old fortunes and make sure the club is growing on and off the pitch. "That in itself is a massive challenge, i love football, i love the business side of it as well as the coaching side, so this is the perfect opportunity." Michael Foley will remain at the club in a new president role, secretary Steve Mahoney will be vice-chairman, manager Jonny Fowell and first-team coach Darren Gosnell will also join the board. "I joined the club with Jonny Fowell back in November and it was very evident from Michael from the early conversations that there were a lot of struggles financially and the club was just ticking along and actually there were some conversations that if there were no changes in the next year that the club could probably not continue. "It was bringing enough revenue in to cover the costs and many different people were having to put their hands into their pockets to keep the club going on a week-to-week basis. "The chairman said they're looking for fresh ideas and fresh blood to come into the club, and they're happy to hand the club over to somebody who wants to do it. "At that point I didn't think anything of it, I just said I've got a bit of experience in trying to help set-up a youth system, so I can help with that but as the months went on the conversations got deeper. "Michael who was the chairman has solely held the club together with a few other people over the years and as we know football has changed it's all about social media and how can you gain sponsorship."

And can town centres start to recover without the "social" elements like pubs and coffee shops that make them a place people want to visit and meet their friends? Many people have missed the social elements of getting out of the house to go shopping - but retailers have recognised that others will be feeling very nervous - and some scientists' warnings that lockdown is being relaxed too fast is likely to cause many people to think twice before heading out on what they might consider "non-essential" shopping. What can our towns do to persuade shoppers that they are safe places when there are constant warnings of the need for social distancing? The future of our town centres is the subject of our next Open House forum that will take place online on Thursday lunchtime for an hour from noon. We have assembled a panel including Paul Clement from Ipswich Central, Mark Cordell from Our Bury St Edmunds and independent retailer Cathy Frost who sits on the Ipswich Vision Partnership and the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership. We will be discussing the future of our town centres - and will welcome questions and other contributions from viewers during the event. The event is the continuation of our Open House forums which began in early March, inviting readers into our newsroom to discuss the biggest local issues. While social distancing measures and the current coronavirus lockdown make it impossible for people to gather in person, we are continuing to stage these events online through a Zoom video conference.

Put simply, World Rugby is desperate to see the United States become a rugby superpower.
 “Raising the profile of the game in the U.S., from World Rugby’s perspective, raises the profile of the game worldwide,” Latham said. “It doesn’t just open up the market for us, it opens up the American market for more evolved and commercially successful unions and teams.
 “The United States market is of huge interest to World Rugby to tap into.”
 Ross Young, chief executive of USA Rugby, told the AP that World Rugby immediately jumped in and helped fund the bankruptcy process when his organization “imploded” — as he described it — when the pandemic struck.
 Already in a perilous position because of huge losses from a poorly attended Wales-South Africa test in Washington and overspending while preparing the men’s team for last year’s World Cup, Young said USA Rugby was thrown “into a tailspin” by the virus outbreak arriving just when the governing body was about to start a new membership cycle. There was also sponsor pull-back.
 The decision to file for bankruptcy was announced on March 31.
 “It gave us the opportunity to hit the reset button,” said Young, who detailed how his organization has removed the old-style congress system, decentralized community responsibilities, and is trying to form a sustainable business structure out of the national office.

La comitiva composta dai dieci giovani descritta nel Decamerone di Giovanni Boccaccio - che durante la peste nera del 1348 decisero di rifugiarsi in un isolato casolare nella campagna toscana - non disponevano di un visore VR e dovettero “accontentarsi” di trascorrere il tempo intrattenendosi attraverso novelle a tema da loro stessi create grazie alla sola forza dell’immaginazione. A differenza della celebre opera della letteratura italiana del Trecento, la nuova brigata 2.0 - oltre a disporre delle apparecchiature all’ultimo grido - riceve un pacco con una lettera, all’interno viene spiegato che i dieci dovranno confrontarsi con una nuova piaga, il mondo intero è infatti bloccato in casa per un motivo misterioso. All’atipica scorribanda viene chiesto di partecipare ad un progetto che intende sperimentare nuove forme di socialità e intrattenimento. Ogni partecipante racconterà una storia agli altri nove e il dispositivo per la realtà virtuale aiuterà loro a viaggiare verso universi dove si mescolano fantasia, sogni e ricordi, trasformando così un isolamento forzato in un’occasione di feconda creatività dove, capolavori provenienti dalla cultura più squisitamente pop e geek degli ultimi 40 anni, sono stati “agitati e non mescolati” in uno shaker alla velocità della luce. Il cocktail che ne è uscito ha il gusto e il sapore di un Ready Player One servito a livello musicale e, come nella pellicola di Steven Spielberg, diverte l’ascoltatore più attento a trovare i giusti riferimenti nerd.

“We are not completely out of the woods yet, but a lot of the hard yards have been done.”
 It means American rugby leaders can contemplate the U.S. hosting a World Cup, either in 2027 or in ’31.
 Latham is a former chairman of USA Rugby's board and is the country's member on World Rugby’s executive committee, so understands exactly what is at stake. He describes it as a “massive undertaking” but is encouraged by Japan successfully hosting the 2019 World Cup, which spotlighted the Asian rugby market.
 The hosts of the ’27 and ’31 men’s World Cups will be announced at the same time — that decision will most likely be pushed back to 2022 now — and Latham said World Rugby may decide to choose one host for its commercial return and another for “potential growth of the game.”
 “It’s something USA Rugby would be interested in, at the appropriate time, and it’s something that World Rugby certainly would be supportive of,” he said.
 “The benefits of it would boost U.S. rugby and the global game.”

The global race for a COVID-19 vaccine boils down to some critical questions: How much must the shots rev up someone’s immune system to really work? And could revving it the wrong way cause harm?
 Even as companies recruit tens of thousands of people for larger vaccine studies this summer, behind the scenes scientists still are testing ferrets, monkeys and other animals in hopes of clues to those basic questions — steps that in a pre-pandemic era would have been finished first.
 “We are in essence doing a great experiment,” said Ralph Baric, a coronavirus expert at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, whose lab is testing several vaccine candidates in animals.
 The speed-up is necessary to try to stop a virus that has triggered a pandemic, killing more than 360,000 worldwide and shuttering economies. But “there’s no question there is more risk in the current strategy than what has ever been done before," Baric said.
 The animal testing lets scientists see how the body reacts to vaccines in ways studies in people never can, said Kate Broderick, research chief at Inovio Pharmaceuticals.
 With animals, “we’re able to perform autopsies and look specifically at their lung tissue and get a really deep dive in looking at how their lungs have reacted,” Broderick said.

Analysing the eight players in action on Tuesday, Paul Krishnamurty says the two big-guns in Group 9 are worth opposing... Ominous start from tournament favourite Favourite backers couldn't have asked for a better start to the new, revamped Championship League. Judd Trump won all three matches and David Gilbert only dropped one point en route to winning his group. Perhaps, despite short matches and a complete lack of form or practice indicators, this will be more predictable than many of us assumed. Then again, perhaps Trump is just a class apart and has been able to practice, while Gilbert didn't have much to beat. Hitman looks well-suited to format The two groups in action today are less one-sided on paper. Group 3 is very competitive. I've backed the favourite Michael Holt at 150/1 on the outright market but, in truth, I wouldn't rule out any of his opponents from progressing. Mark Davis and Mark Joyce also have experience in spades, whereas Louis Heathcote is capable enough to produce an upset. Nevertheless given his pedigree over one frame, preference for short matches and no shortage of natural ability, 'Hitman' definitely looks the one to beat. I'd rather stick to the outright and avoid taking short odds in any of the matches, but around [2.7] for the group is fair. Will Lisowki's natural talent shine through? Jack Lisowski starts favourite for Group 9 and may be the type of naturally talented player to thrive without much practice under his belt. This isn't an easy group though and a similar argument could be made for principal rival Luca Brecel. I'm happy to take both of them on. The day one evidence hasn't altered my instinct that tactical nous and experience will be particularly important this week. Even Trump gave his opponents plenty of chances. Neither Lisowski or Brecel have ever convinced me on those fronts or demonstrated much of a 'B game'. While limited in talent, Robbie Williams does know how to scrap. As for the outsider of four - Oliver Lines is no mug and has taken plenty of superior scalps. Backing both Williams and Lines at [5.5] and [11.0] for the group combines to around [3.5].

Residents in some Forsyth County neighborhoods are left searching for answers as they have watched subdivision pools open all around them while their own amenities have remained closed.The Riverstone Plantation Homeowner’s Association is one of several boards in Forsyth County that made the decision to keep their amenities closed with no opening date planned. At first, the HOA announced earlier in May that it would be opening its pool, asking residents to volunteer to monitor the space and make sure pool visitors were keeping social distancing guidelines in mind. Days later, however, several residents were disappointed and frustrated when the HOA provided them with a statement from its attorney, Benjamin Ost, stating that it was recommended that it keep the pool and other amenities closed for the time being.“The Board has met all of the requirements of the C.D.C. sanitizing and social distancing guidelines, but even with these processes in place the risk to our Association is still great,” the HOA’s statement reads.Ost advised the HOA that even following social distancing guidelines, cleaning as often as possible and putting up warning signs may not prevent lawsuits against the HOA if a resident were to contract COVID\u002D19 while using its amenities.In the meantime, the statement provided that the HOA will continue to work with committee members and vendors to try to open the pool back up as soon as it is safe for both residents and the HOA to do so.The president of Chadbourne’s HOA, Frank Garrahan, came to a similar decision, letting residents know in an email that it is too soon to open neighborhood amenities.“I know that many of you would like to see our amenities area opened,” Garrahan wrote in the email. “I too would like to see it opened and things getting back to normal.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — The Hungarian soccer federation has issued a written reprimand to a player of African origin who showed his undershirt with the words “Justice for George Floyd” after scoring a goal.
 Tokmac Nguen was born in a refugee camp in Kenya to parents from South Sudan and grew up in Norway. He scored for Ferencvaros in its 1-1 draw with Puskas Akademia on Sunday.
 The federation’s disciplinary committee said in a ruling issued Monday that any similar actions by Nguen in the future would result in “actual penalties” on each occasion.
 Floyd died in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving. Floyd’s death has sparked days of protests across the United States.
 FIFA has urged soccer competition organizers to apply “common sense” and consider not sanctioning players demanding justice for Floyd during matches.
 “FIFA fully understands the depth of sentiment and concerns expressed by many footballers in light of the tragic circumstances of the George Floyd case,” FIFA said. “The application of the laws of the game … is left for the competitions’ organizers, which should use common sense and have in consideration the context surrounding the events.”

With the soccer World Cup lined up for 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics two years later, the United States will be the focal point for sports later this decade.
 Another worldwide event could yet be squeezed in the middle.
 Seeking to get back on its feet after filing for bankruptcy during the coronavirus outbreak, USA Rugby retains a vision of bidding for the Rugby World Cup in 2027 and completing an all-American lineup of what, in some parts of the world, would be regarded as the three biggest events in sports.
 “A Rugby World Cup (in the United States) would be the pinnacle of raising the profile of the game,” Bob Latham, U.S. rugby's most high-ranking official, told The Associated Press, “but we need to make sure we are ready to do it.”
 How can a country go from financial oblivion to World Cup host in seven years, some will ask.
 Well, the United States holds a special status in the eyes of rugby’s governing body, World Rugby.
 Never a power in the game on the field — indeed, they haven’t gotten out of their pool at a Rugby World Cup in eight attempts — the Americans nonetheless retain a vital place in global rugby because of the untapped potential they possess, in both a commercial and sporting sense.

Un bando di affidamento e gestione di un tale inestimabile bene se concepito attraverso tali strumenti può quindi rappresentare un momento più organico di rilancio politico del territorio e di investimento finanziario soprattutto per le molteplici attività, finora chiuse a causa dell’emergenza Covid19, che certo permetterebbe alla Città ed ai futuri visitatori e turisti di godere appieno dell’ intero patrimonio culturale e di rilanciare il Centro Storico coriglianese nonché in una considerata economia circolare ,l’intera Città di Corigliano Rossano. Altra cosa se tali strumenti non sono stati attivati come di fatto è rilevabile. Ed è soprattutto per queste mancanze di strumenti che bisognerà verificare se il procedimento dell’eventuale affidamento, che deve essere sempre preceduto da un’ attenta attività di discussione politica ed istruttoria del procedimento, sia regolarizzato in tutte le sue parti, non ultima l’aspetto relativo alla cura ,alla sicurezza, ed alla manutenzione del bene, al controllo costante della gestione. Insomma l’eventuale contrattazione di affidamento a terzi del Castello deve garantire l’alto profilo professionale del gestore e la migliore offerta di promozione del bene che dia, difatti, vantaggi alla Città, senza per questo limitare o danneggiare l’eventuale azione del gestore. Se queste cose non sono state assicurate , dobbiamo avere seri motivi di preoccupazione .Un aspetto del genere così vitale per il rilancio di un’intera area se non ben ponderato può determinare gravi danni per il Comune e principalmente per il Centro storico coriglianese. Per quanto fin qui riportato il bando andrebbe subito ritirato ed affrontato con quello spirito che deve contraddistinguere la lungimiranza di un buon padre di famiglia , appunto, una buona amministrazione.
