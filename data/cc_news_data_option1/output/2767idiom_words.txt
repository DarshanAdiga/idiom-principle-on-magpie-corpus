Let us approach the former subject first. The benefit of being able to look back at every analysis of past events, of course, makes comprehension so much easier than making statements on the day of the event, but in the case of the July 15 coup attempt, one thing became clear at once: A terror network which had infiltrated many layers of the Turkish state was behind it. FETÖ had grown into a cancer-like threat and showed its ugly face by trying to destroy modern Turkey.

The question at the heart of the matter is why European governments and intelligence services did not support Ankara much more efficiently in locating and extraditing known FETÖ fugitives. Why did other European governments and in particular the United States not heed the warnings mentioned by Sir Duncan?

One set of questions springs to mind in this context. How would a government in Berlin have reacted if terrorists flew fighter jets over their national parliament, the Reichstag, and bombed it? How would a French government react should similar events unfold in the capital Paris? What could be the only logical reaction by a Spanish government in the case of a comparable terrorist attack in Madrid? All this must be paired with the realization that this was not a one-man job but the result of a vast terrorist network having infiltrated the entire state structure and was probably ready to strike again.

Correct, but this was the precise reasoning for declaring a state of emergency in the first place: to make certain a follow-up coup attempt was an impossibility, that the criminal minds behind the atrocities would be caught, that the cancer-like FETÖ network would be erased from within the Turkish state and that the rule of law and thus democracy would be defended and guaranteed.

As it seemed, FETÖ was declared an internal Turkish problem and not a global terrorist threat. The logic behind such an approach is hard to grasp.

Onto the latter point raised in the introduction: Why was there such widespread criticism when Ankara declared a state of emergency right after the coup attempt? And why did this criticism not go away when it was rightfully prolonged?

The comment underlined not just the close bilateral relations between two partner nations but also showed that while one European government clearly accepted the fact of how dangerous the Gülenists are, others preferred to close their eyes. In addition, Sir Duncan’s comments gave insight into the shocking reality in so far that FETÖ had established itself overseas and not just at home in Turkey. In this regard there is no big difference between the banned PKK and FETÖ; both as we now know engage in &quot;fundraising&quot; and money-laundering abroad.

Well, a state of emergency would have been declared there and then. But as it was Turkey doing just that, support for the measures was automatically withheld. It was as if Turkey should at once reverse the decision to declare a state of emergency and return to normality as if nothing had happened – a strange way to help an ally and friendly nation in need. Besides, and to highlight this point as often as is, unfortunately, necessary, where were the practical offers to help stop the spread of the FETÖ terrorist network overseas as described in the previous part of this short analysis?

Yet seen from abroad, the acceptance of this reality and conveyance of the message was somehow more difficult. In order to shed more light on this observation, we have to recall the visit by British Minister of State for Europe Sir Alan Duncan, who was the first high-ranking European politician to travel to Ankara after the coup attempt. While most other foreign governments were still in a wait-and-see position, Sir Duncan made a razor-sharp comment. He warned about the perception management of FETÖ members living abroad who would try to turn attention away from the fact that it was the Gülenists themselves who had planned to topple the democratically elected Turkish government.
