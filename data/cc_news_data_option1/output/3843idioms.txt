There are some instruments that are too large to handle easily. The piano was usually a stationary instrument until the electronic keyboard came along. Drums and other large instruments took time to set up and the big bass had to be handled carefully so as not to damage an expensive piece of equipment. Sometimes this meant hours of setting up and tearing down, requiring stage hands to help facilitate a gig or a concert.
 One instrument that could easily be transported, required no help from anyone else to move, and was not an expense or one that required constant tuning was the human voice. This, beyond any other musical instrument you can name, has always been one of the most important components of music. Sure, you can have classical instrumental music that has genius in its composition; Bach and Beethoven are prime examples. Their music can transport people into an almost hypnotic state, but a human voice can, with or without instruments to back it up, tell stories of love and loneliness, war and heroism, faith and freedom, and any element the human condition. Songwriters and singers are the added element that give instruments the ability to describe an emotion, record history, add fun and lightheartedness or describe heartache, fear, hope, joy and the whole array of human emotions into a two or three minute sonnet, or love song that can bring a listener to tears. In the words of Lawrence County songwriter Bill Terry, “There’s an old saying, “If you listen to a country song backwards you’ll get your wife and your dog back.”
 Many songwriters and singers from this part of the world started out on the small stages of local churches. Some of them were practically just out of diapers when they stood on stage and sang along with their siblings, learning harmony seemingly by proximity to their older sisters or brothers.

So Democrats are seriously considering changing the rules if they win both houses of Congress — either by imposing term limits for Supreme Court justices or by adding more seats to the court.
 Term limits are eminently sensible. They would end the ghoulish system of waiting, in most cases, for justices to get sick or die to change the lineup. But it would require a constitutional amendment and take far too long to satisfy Americans who believe the court is out of step.
 That leaves court packing, a brute-force remedy that can be accomplished by an act of Congress. The idea would be to add (in one version) four seats, to enable the next president — Joe Biden, presumably — to swing the court’s majority from conservative to liberal.
 To be fair, there’s nothing sacred about nine justices sitting in black robes. The first court had six justices, and Congress added and subtracted seats repeatedly between 1789 and 1869.
 But it has been nine justices since then, so adding more would shatter a norm — something we’ve seen a lot of in the Trump years. If Democrats force it through, it’s a little late for Republicans to flap their arms over a lack of bipartisan support.
 Biden is not on board, at least not yet. He’s an institutionalist by instinct and history. Last year, he said he opposed court packing because it would harm the court’s “credibility.” But momentum is growing among Democrats, especially progressives.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A Nebraska prisoner who convinced a judge to throw out his first-degree murder conviction and order his release will remain behind bars after the state Supreme Court overturned that ruling on Friday.
 The decision was a win for prosecutors, who had to scramble to keep Jack Harris in prison after the district court judge's order last year. Harris is serving a life sentence for a 1995 shooting death of Anthony Jones during a drug robbery in Omaha.
 Judge Jody Nelson ordered Harris' release in February 2019 after concluding that prosecutors violated his right to a speedy trial.
 Harris, 49, had sought an appeal after a witness recanted and alleged that police intimidated him into testifying. Judge William Zastera granted Harris a new trial in September 2017 and soon retired.
 The Nebraska attorney general’s office appealed, arguing that no evidentiary hearing was held. The case had been in limbo for months because no replacement judge was immediately appointed.
 Judge Jodi Nelson took over the case in July. Nelson said Harris wasn’t tried within six months of Zastera’s order, in violation of his right to a speedy trial. Nelson also criticized the state for failing to take steps to move the case forward.

Doing so will take a bit of work. Although the internet contains uncountable historical treasures, its most-used services tend to constrict our focus to the instantaneous ever-present. Every moment on social media offers up a deluge of novelty; news is always breaking, memes always trending, hot takes never not taken.
 The Trump years, especially, have been marked by a barrage of events so overwhelming that each new day seems to scramble every day that preceded it. We are all Dory, Nemo’s forgetful fish friend, so unsettled by the present that we forge — I’m sorry, my pocket just buzzed, what was I saying?
 Right. To visit the past online, you need to deliberately seek it out. My method was straightforward; I began by reading. In addition to Caro’s Johnson biography, the historian Rick Perlstein’s excellent books on the rise of modern conservatism — which take readers from Barry Goldwater through the treacheries of Richard Nixon to, in the latest volume, the political era dominated by Ronald Reagan — are a perfect place to start.
 Then, as you read, seek out videos online. Among other things, you will find the chilling news coverage of Johnson arriving at Andrews Air Force Base after the assassination. There’s Johnson’s 1965 speech introducing the Voting Rights Act, in which he invoked the anthem “We Shall Overcome,” a speech that made Martin Luther King Jr. cry. You will find King’s own thundering speeches — not just the most famous one, but also many others worthy of your time, including the last one he gave.
 You see Malcolm X parrying with derisive reporters (“What is your real name?”). There’s news coverage of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, as delegates cheer inside and riots erupt outside. Here is Walter Cronkite telling Americans the truth about the war in Vietnam, which pushed Johnson not to run for reelection. By the time you get to Nixon, you are overwhelmed with video — from his slick 1968 campaign ads to the dramatic trip to China to the endless hours of content related to Watergate.
 Sure, there are easier ways to understand Watergate. “Slow Burn,” the Slate podcast that documented Nixon’s downfall, may be a better use of your time than watching every minute of the investigation. But the magic of the internet is how it collapses time; you can listen to a documentary produced in 2017 about a break-in in 1972, and then, if you want to fall in even further, you can watch testimony in the Senate’s 1973 Watergate hearings as if it were just unfolding.

After the 2016 election, I was deeply shaken not just by the outcome, but by the terrifying sense that I did not understand the nation as well as I’d thought I did. To blunt the shock, I went on a bender through American history. I dove into books about the Civil War, the Progressive era and, finally, Robert Caro’s titanic biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, where I washed up on the shores of the turbulent 1960s.
 I discovered something amazing: After 1960, much of history as many Americans experienced it — through popular culture on TV, on the radio and at the movies — is preserved and easily accessible online. With a few clicks around YouTube, history leaps into the present, often in ways that deepen and complicate the narrative.
 For instance, Caro ably describes Johnson’s stirring first presidential address to Congress. It was five days after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the new president pressed lawmakers to pass civil rights legislation in Kennedy’s honor. “Everywhere you looked, people were crying,” the journalist Hugh Sidey wrote.
 Watching the speech is something else. “All I have I would have given gladly not to be standing here today,” Johnson begins, and the hairs on the back of your neck tingle. You feel the weight of the hushed chamber and Johnson’s labored delivery. And then, the trauma that enveloped the audience is transformed, over the 24-minute address, into cheering determination, even hope.
 That was the speech that hooked me, and soon I found myself living a second life in the past. I’d spend my days as a journalist covering the raucous present; but on and off over the last few years, on nights and weekends and vacations, I’d jump into my digital DeLorean and take up residence in earlier times — making my way, slowly, through the 1960s and then the ’70s, accompanied by an unending library of historical documents and pop cultural artifacts I found online.
 It is a project I commend you to try. Go live for a bit in another, far-off decade, and I promise it will give you fresh perspective on a present as nutty as ours.

 And he said it was disappointing that the government had not put hard-hit Bolton in line with the national curfew.
 "This is a huge area that has been under restrictions for a long time now," he continued.
 "We understand the government will be announcing changes later today, but one thing I want to reference is the suggestion the government is moving to a tiering scheme.
 "There are doubts here about the extent to which the restrictions have been effective. At best, we can say they have stopped the growth in cases we would otherwise have seen."

“Most people ought to contribute the maximum,” says Roger C. Hewins III, President of Team Hewins, LLC in Redwood City, California. “The power of compounding is amazing. You need to put it to work for you starting as early as possible. People typically don’t think hard enough about how much they will need to retire and how long it will take to save and invest enough to have financial security. If you cannot do so now, try at least to contribute the amount to get the full employer match. It is free money. Then work your way to the maximum depending on cash flow needs.”

I’ve been called on the carpet for saying the other day that Kellen Moore is the only Boise State quarterback ever to take a regular-season NFL snap. The name Ryan Finley comes up immediately. It’s easy to overlook Finley because he left the Broncos in 2016 and played his final three seasons at North Carolina State (and played very well). But he’s a legit former Bronco—in fact, he’s a legit Boise State graduate. Finley was a fourth-round pick of Cincinnati in the 2019 NFL Draft and is now backing up Joe Burrow for the Bengals. He replaced Andy Dalton as Cincy starter for three games last fall, going 0-3. For the season, Finley completed 47 percent of his throws and passed for 474 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions.

A Turkish coast guard officer, wearing protective gear to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, carries a child off a life raft during a rescue operation in the Aegean Sea, between Turkey and Greece, Saturday, Sept. 12, 2020. Turkey is accusing Greece of large-scale pushbacks at sea — summary deportations without access to asylum procedures, in violation of international law. The Turkish coast guard says it rescued over 300 migrants "pushed back by Greek elements to Turkish waters" this month alone. Greece denies the allegations and accuses Ankara of weaponizing migrants.

For more than three decades, the Palestinians have sought an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories seized by Israel in the 1967 war. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but imposed a crippling blockade when the Palestinian militant group Hamas seized power from Abbas' forces in 2007.
 There have been no substantive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was first elected more than a decade ago, and the two sides are fiercely divided over the core issues of the conflict.
 Instead, Netanyahu has focused on building ties with Arab, African and Asian countries that have long supported the Palestinian cause. In Israel, the agreement with the United Arab Emirates, an oil-rich country with considerable regional influence, is seen as a historic breakthrough that could transform the Middle East.
 Israel put on hold its plans to annex up to a third of the occupied West Bank following the deal with the UAE, while saying it still plans to eventually go through with them. The UAE said the agreement removed an immediate threat to the two-state solution and gave the region a window of opportunity.
 The Palestinians insist that the core Middle East conflict will not be resolved until they realize their aspirations for independence.
 “There can be no peace, no security, no stability, no coexistence in our region without an end to the occupation,” Abbas said, speaking behind a plaque that read “State of Palestine.”
 “We will not bow down," he said. "We will not surrender. We will not compromise. And we shall triumph."
