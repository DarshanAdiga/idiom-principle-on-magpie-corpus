On Jan. 17, 1966, a U.S. B-52 bomber and a refueling plane collided during a refueling operation near the southern Spanish village of Palomares, killing seven of 11 crew members but no one on the ground. At the time, the U.S. was keeping nuclear-armed warplanes in the air near the Soviet border as the Cold War was in full swing.

“If we are looking at increasing expenses, I think we should look at becoming more efficient so you’re able to absorb some of those costs,” he said. “This economy won’t stay great forever. Anytime we can look at becoming more efficient, more productive and using our resources to the maximum potential I think we should do that.”


  He added, “None of this is to say that you’re not doing a good job as commissioners. It’s merely looking at modernizing our county government. It might not work for Marshall County, but I do think we owe it to the tax payer to look into our system as a whole.”


  Hutcheson responded to some of Sen. Scofield’s comments about the unit system.


  “I’m not opposed to anything and don’t think we need to stick our hand in the sand when it comes to the possibility of a new system,” he said. “But I do know DeKalb County is on the unit system and I believe their roads are worse than ours. However, I am open to looking at different scenarios.”


  District 1 Commissioner Ronnie Shumate had a follow up question for Sen. Scofield following Hutcheson’s remarks.


  “So, you’re not interested in getting involved with the revenue commissioner’s request unless we can swap over to the unit system?” Shumate asked.


  “No, I’m saying we need to look at the unit system,” Sen. Scofield responded. “If we’re going to look at pay increases, let’s also look at county government structure. One is not depending on the other. Let’s look at both.”


  No decision was made in regards to switching Marshall County from districts a unit system.

NEW YORK (AP) — A public school in Brooklyn is looking to show how classes can be moved outside to more safely facilitate in-person learning.
 Teachers and parents at Public School 15 in the Red Hook neighborhood took to the street outside their campus Wednesday to demonstrate one way outdoor learning could work.
 From afar, the demonstration looked like a street fair or a farmer's market. Past a crossing guard, a traffic barricade and a handwashing station, teachers held lessons with children under 10, who sat on cushions on asphalt.
 “Teachers and principals and parents are modeling outdoor learning, and fighting to get more of it and soon,” said City Council Member Brad Lander, who has been polling school districts on their desire for outdoor schooling since July.
 The demonstration follows a deal Tuesday between Mayor Bill de Blasio and unions representing school staff and administrators, who had been talking about a possible strike out of concern that the school system wasn't ready to safely start the school year. In a compromise, the start of mixed in-person and online learning was delayed for several days, and city officials promised to test 10-20% of students and staff for the virus each month.
 If New York City schools open their classrooms to students as planned on Sept. 21, it will be the largest district to have pupils physically in school buildings during the pandemic.

The committee is also asking for information about how DeJoy, whose appointment broke a long line of postmaster generals with previous experience at the agency, was picked for the job, as well as any communications between DeJoy and the Trump campaign. It is also requesting DeJoy's unredacted calendar along with records on potential communications with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.
 In a letter Friday to the committee, DeJoy said postal leadership has expanded a task force on election mail with local officials and said his staff was working to provide the requested materials. He has said election mail is his “No. 1 priority,” and that he will authorize expanded use of overtime, extra truck trips and other measures in the weeks before the election to ensure on- time delivery of ballots.
 In a statement after the subpoena was issued, a spokesman for the Postal Service said the agency will comply with the committee's request.
 “We remain surprised and confused by Chairwoman Maloney’s insistence on issuing a subpoena to the Postal Service in the midst of ongoing dialogue with her staff on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform to produce information in an orderly fashion. We fully intend to comply with our obligations under the law,” the statement read.
 Separately, an audit from the inspector general of the Postal Service found that more than a million mail-in ballots were sent to voters late during the primary elections. The watchdog urged greater cooperation between states and the agency ahead of the November election.
 The report found state election boards sent more than a million ballots within a week of their primaries, creating a “high risk” that they couldn't be filled out and returned in time to be counted. In thousands of cases across the country, ballots were sent out after states' mailing deadlines or on election day.

“Democratic mayors don’t govern as Democrats for the most part,” said Elisabeth Gerber, a political scientist at the University of Michigan.


  About 85% of all cities have nominally nonpartisan elections, in which candidates’ party affiliations never appear on the ballot (researchers, however, have ways of sussing out partisanship nonetheless). And in some cities that do have partisan elections, the leading candidates may all be Democrats, making their partisan identities unimportant. Party is less relevant, anyway, to local races that may turn on who can clear the snow fastest, or negotiate with the teachers’ union effectively, or build the most affordable housing.


  “Partisanship isn’t the story either in electoral politics, or in position- taking, or in messaging,” Gerber said. “It’s not like they’re running _as_ Democrats.”


  Cities have been faced with problems far beyond their making. Deindustrialization and globalization wiped out many middle-class factory jobs, destabilizing neighborhoods of blue-collar workers. The federal policy of highway construction enabled both taxpayers and employers to leave cities. Federal housing policies dissuaded or prevented Black residents initially from joining them, cementing patterns of racial and economic segregation that persist to this day.


  The coronavirus pandemic offers another example. Gerber and colleagues found that nearly half of Detroit’s labor force was unemployed at the worst moment of the pandemic this summer, as lower-wage workers were hit hardest by the economic crisis and Black residents were hit hardest by the virus. That pattern isn’t Mayor Mike Duggan’s fault, Gerber said.


  As cities have confronted these problems over decades, Republicans in Washington have cut funding to cities and programs they relied on.


  “Republican administrations have really decided that cities should be left to market forces,” said Marion Orr, a professor of political science and urban studies at Brown University. “And those cities who can survive those market forces are worthy of survival, and those who cannot really find themselves struggling.”

But locals and tourists alike said COVID enforcement measures haven’t been consistent. Capt. Matthias Bitterwolf, owner of Antillean Yacht Charters on St. Thomas, said he delivered a boat to Puerto Rico and was not allowed off the vessel until local police could verify his COVID paperwork. His COVID status was not checked upon returning to St. Thomas.The Virgin Islands’ case counts soon began ticking up. Between June and mid-July, the case count increased by more than 3,500%, according to one NBC news report.


  Gov. Bryan responded by issuing other executive orders to regain control of the outbreak, including prohibiting beach visits after 4 p.m.


  Puerto Rico formally welcomed tourists on July 15 while still imposing some COVID-related restrictions. As in the Virgin Islands, officials required travelers to present documentation of a negative COVID test result upon arrival.


  Dr. Victor Ramos, president of the island’s medical association who is involved with the island’s medical task force, said these decisions tended to expose the rift “between the medical task force that favors closing things and the economic task force that wants to leave everything open.”


  By July, the local economy was in shambles. The Department of Labor reported over 21% of the island’s workforce was receiving unemployment assistance related to the pandemic.


  Government data, though, indicated Puerto Rico’s climbing case numbers were not being triggered by tourists. They are not the culprits, insisted Leah Chandler, chief marketing officer of Discover Puerto Rico, the island’s official tourism website. Rather, the spread was linked to island residents coming home after visiting COVID hot spots like Texas and Florida.


  Despite the global pandemic and the restrictions, both territories have experienced no shortage of vacationers. “We would have expected this to be a slow moment for us in terms of tourism,” said Sewer. “It’s very busy.”


  Still, the trend lines for COVID case counts weren’t moving in the right direction for either territory, so it was no surprise when Puerto Rico closed days after reopening and the USVI followed suit on Aug. 19. The underlying socioeconomic and health issues put residents in both places at high risk. It’s not just the prevalence of chronic health conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The high number of multigenerational households in both areas complicates a family’s ability to socially distance from its most vulnerable members. Roughly a quarter of the population in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands is age 65 or older, and poverty is widespread.


  At the same time, both territories have limited health care infrastructure.


  The Virgin Islands has 20 intensive care unit beds and about 100 one-time-use ventilators for its 106,235 residents, said Justa Encarnacion, the USVI’s health commissioner. Each island has about 30 full-capacity ventilators.


  In Puerto Rico, about 60% of the island’s ventilators for adults were available as of Aug. 24. However, ICU beds are harder to come by, said Ramos. They are filled with COVID patients.


  The string of problems that have besieged these islands magnifies the effects of the pandemic. That includes debt crises and infrastructure damage from hurricanes. Island residents also fear the possibility of battling a hurricane and a coronavirus outbreak at the same time — a reality that they’ve already confronted when COVID hampered the V.I.’s emergency management agency’s ability to distribute sandbags ahead of a storm in late July.


  “At this point, we literally have disasters layered on top of disasters,” said Sewer, of the St. John’s Collective.


  Still, V.I. Tourism Commissioner Joseph Boschulte is cautiously optimistic. “We appreciate the concerns of our tourism partners and stakeholders,” he said. But with the spike in cases, he said, “we must reset, take stock, safeguard human life and prepare for restarting our tourism economy at a later date.”

Maduro said on Aug. 12 that the jail currently houses 74 detainees, and has 47 staff members, which means that nearly a quarter of all inmates have tested positive.


  The jail remains under lockdown, and new arrestees who must remain in custody are being transported to St. Croix’s Golden Grove Adult Correctional Facility, where testing is also being conducted as a precaution. Maduro said no inmates or staff at the prison have tested positive.


  It’s unclear how many inmates and staff members have recovered since the initial outbreak was detected, and how many others have tested positive.

Jones, who signed a one year extension last season, has caught the eye in pre-season, scoring two outstanding goals in back-to-back warm-up games to give the manager plenty of food for thought ahead of the new campaign.


  If the exciting forward can continue to impress he will no doubt push himself to the fore rather than be considered for a short-term loan to get game time.


  Either way, he remains in the manager's plans but it's just a question of how soon he can feature regularly in the new campaign.


  Frenchman Biamou, meanwhile, has slipped down the pecking order this summer and could find himself the victim of Tyler Walker’s arrival.


  The 29-year-old needs to play and his future at City may well depend on whether he wants to stay and fight for his place, as he did so successfully last season, and also whether Robins has to move players on to balance the books.

It’s likely that one of the reasons we always gravitate back toward Crocs is that they’re like no other shoe. The silhouettes are unique—especially when we think of the classic waterproof clog—and they have something _so_ many shoes don’t: comfort. At the end of the day, a pair of shoes that leaves blisters just isn’t worth it. If you have to do a lot of standing or walking during the day, you want something comfortable enough to actually wear for long hours. Thankfully, keeping a pair of the best Crocs for women in your shoe rotation can help you do just that.

Mims is expected to be a key part of the Jets' offense this season, providing Sam Darnold with a speedy deep threat to complement projected starters Jamison Crowder and Breshad Perriman. But until Wednesday, the rookie couldn't do much more than study in the classroom and watch from the sideline during practice.


  “It feels amazing,” Mims said. “It felt really good to compete at practice, get back in a rhythm and get my feet wet a little, catch some balls and just be out there with my teammates.”


  Mims acknowledged it was “very frustrating” having to be sidelined to start his first NFL camp, but remained patient until he got the go-ahead from the trainers and doctors.


  “I just wanted to come out there and do what I was supposed to do and just practice,” Mims said. “I've never had to sit out this long. I've never had anything like this.”


  Gase said the Jets will monitor his snaps in practice while also try to get him up to speed quickly.


  “The fact that he’s been doing as much cardio as he’s been doing and trying to make sure he’s in the kind of shape we need him in,” Gase said, “we’re going to have to build it up, but we need him to put things on fast-forward mentally.”

Alpha Pro Tech Ltd. (APT) shares on Tuesday's trading session, dropped -3.14 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $13.59 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of $0.91 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $2.66 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -12.30% and predicted to reach at 40.74% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out-come was 9.20% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 15.00% for the next five year.

Dear Dave,   With COVID-19 and all the resulting economic problems, do you have any advice for what a young person can do to prepare for the future?   Kyle


  Dear Kyle,   Regardless of the coronavirus or any economic situation that might arise, there are always a few smart, simple things people can do to protect themselves financially. The number one thing is to live on a written, monthly budget. When you give every dollar a name, and write it down on paper, you're telling your money what to do, instead of scratching your head and wondering where it went.


  Staying out of debt and saving as much money as possible are two other great ideas. Remember, your income is your biggest wealth-building tool. If you're saddled with a bunch of debt, your money goes to creditors - not into your pocket. Saving prepares you for the future and all the unexpected things, both good and bad, life will throw at you.


  Even though you're young, investing is a key component in creating a stable financial outlook for yourself. In your 20s, just $100 a month invested properly in good growth stock mutual funds can make you a millionaire by the time you're ready to retire.


  Like I said, these are all simple things. But they'll make a huge difference in your financial situation now and in the years to come!   Dave


  Pay that thing off!


    Dear Dave,   My only debt right now is a car payment. I still owe $12,000 on the vehicle, and I currently have $25,000 in savings. I'm in a very stable line of work, but my income can vary somewhat from month to month. Should I hang on to my savings, or pay off the car?   Erik


  Dear Erik,   Debt is a bad thing to have in your life, especially when your income can vary from paycheck to paycheck. You're in good shape, except for the car note, though. It's like a ball and chain around your neck.


  You'd still have $13,000 left if you paid off the car. And with the money you'd free up, you could rebuild your savings in no time. Pay off the car, dude!   Dave

WACO, Texas — Whether students are returning to school in person or online, social interaction won't be the same as previous years due to health guidelines.      Diamante Maya and Katie Chadwell, both child and adolescent therapists at the MHMR Klaras Center for Families in Waco want parents to know being socially distant doesn't mean social isolation.      "I'd encourage parents to think of it more as putting physical distance but maintaining social connectedness," Maya said.      When coming up with way for your kids to stay connected to their peers, think outside the box and be creative. Kids can be on a video call and play games like charades, Pictionary, have scavenger hunts or just talk. If they go outside, they can kick a ball around, ride bikes, or have a picnic all while staying distant and safe.      "Social interaction is how kids learn things like reading social queues, having empathy for others, having social awareness, learning social norms, you know learning how to share how to follow rules,” Chadwell said.      Not enough social contact can lead to increased depression, anxiety, and anger.      "Social connectedness improves children's chances of showing resilience to adversity, it helps them regulate mood, stay grounded, feel less alone, and manage stress,” Maya said.

Adams Morgan is an especially liberal neighborhood in a very liberal city.


  Sure, there are some conservatives there — I lived in Adams Morgan for over a decade — but picking on random white people in Adams Morgan in the hope of finding MAGA types is like scouring Manhattan’s Upper West Side for taxidermists. It’s theoretically possible to find one, but you’ll have your work cut out for you.


  Regardless, Democrats would be well-advised to draw inspiration from Victor’s refusal to be bullied by a mob, even one she sympathizes with, because she is surely more representative of voters than the mob accosting her was.


  American liberalism’s Achilles’ heel has long been a reluctance, sometimes a flat-out inability, to criticize radicals to their left. In the 1960s, leading Democrats kowtowed to extremists out of what historian Fred Siegel called a “riot ideology,” and it cost the party dearly.


  There have been exceptions.


  Americans for Democratic Action arguably saved the Democratic Party from its leftmost wing led by the “useful idiot” Henry Wallace, FDR’s former vice president.


  Bill Clinton broke the GOP’s monopoly on the presidency by deliberately picking fights with the left in order to attract more moderate voters.


  Clinton’s tactics were arguably more cynical than idealistic — he took time off from the campaign trail to oversee the execution of a severely brain- damaged Black man. But say what you will about his “triangulation,” it worked.


  American politics has become a contest between two competing caricatures of reality.


  The primary driver of this dynamic has been the media’s — particularly cable news’ — addiction to narrative journalism combined with the pernicious influence of social media.

In asking Morvant to dismiss Greene's petition, Matthews' attorney, Mary Olive Pierson, argued to the judge that the courts can't declare "a loser a winner." Pierson also said a "do-over" election isn't necessary because Matthews won fair and square.
 Greene argued the election was unlawful because Matthews cannot serve because of her age.
 "If she cannot serve, there's no reason for us to pay for another election," Greene told the judge, adding that she herself is ready to serve.
 Greene's petition named the Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin and Matthews as defendants.
 "It's essential that we protect the sanctity of the election procedure. The voters spoke," Ray Wood, an attorney for Ardoin, argued to Morvant.
 After Morvant had issued his ruling, Pierson told the judge that Matthews hasn't received her judicial commission but is entitled to it.
 "I don't disagree," Morvant replied.
 Pierson said afterward by telephone that she'll reach out to the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office to see to it that Matthews receives her commission.
 The term for the City Court seat that Matthews won expires at the end of 2024.
 Morvant had ruled last month in an age-related challenge to Matthews' candidacy that she could remain on the Aug. 15 runoff ballot. His ruling was upheld by the 1st Circuit and the state Supreme Court.

_L'Aquila, 02 set 14:56 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Preoccupazione per la scarsità d'acqua nelle zone servite dalla diga di Chiauci. In assenza di pioggia la situazione si presenta come particolarmente critica e a risentire della mancanza d'acqua sono soprattutto le campagne, dove le colture invernali sono nelle prime fasi di crescita. L'allarme arriva da Cia Chieti-Pescara che sottolinea la cattiva gestione del Consorzio di bonifica sud evidenziando come sia necessario un approfondito e ragionato approccio sulla gestione della risorsa idrica. "L'arrivo della pioggia è vitale per l'agricoltura", afferma il presidente provinciale Nicola Sichetti. "Il consorzio avrebbe dovuto fare una previsione più oculata e chiedere al Ministero l'ampliamento fino a 7 milioni di metri cubi rispetto ai 4 a disposizione. La presenza di stagioni siccitose non deve più essere considerata un evento eccezionale mettendo a rischio la produzione agricola", continua Sichetti. "Il rischio poteva essere evitato, non è stato adottato un piano di turnazione dell'erogazione idrica né chiesto di raddoppiare la capienza dell'invaso nonostante gli investimenti finanziati dal masterplan Abruzzo", evidenziaa. E' stato, infatti, portato a termine e collaudato il revamping delle paratoie dello scarico di fondo della diga e conclusi gli interventi sull'ammasso roccioso e sulla strada circumlacuale. "I cinque pozzi a disposizione del consorzio saranno sufficienti a sopperire l'emergenza idrica? - chiede il presidente Sichetti - Le colture frutticole hanno bisogno di acqua costante ed è difficile, in queste condizioni, programmare l'irrigazione delle colture invernali. Il tempo stringe, siamo in attesa di decisioni ed input per la distribuzione dell'acqua a fini irrigui per il prossimo mese di settembre. Quello che ci anima è dare certezze alle imprese agricole".

The inspector general also identified a handful of “concerns” surrounding election mail, including ballots sent without bar-coded tracking technology, mail-in ballot designs that make processing difficult, postmark requirements and out-of-date voter addresses.
 “Resolving these issues will require higher level partnerships and cooperation between the Postal Service and various state officials, including secretaries of state and state election boards,” the auditors wrote. “Timely delivery of election and political mail is necessary to ensure the integrity of the U.S. election process.”
 The report found election officials in Kentucky and New York sent more than 600,000 mail-in ballots late during their primaries. In Pennsylvania, 500 ballots were mailed after election day. Seventeen states sent more than a half-million ballots after mailing deadlines, and 44,000 ballots were mailed on or a day before election day in 11 states. Also, an analysis of political and election mail in seven Postal Service processing centers between April and June identified around 1.6 million mailpieces that were not delivered on time.
 The report did not evaluate controversial operational changes implemented by DeJoy. The inspector general's office has opened a separate inquiry into those changes.
 DeJoy has recommended that voters request absentee ballots at least 15 days before the election and then return them within seven days from election day.
 "To be clear, these recommendations are designed to help ensure that ballots will be delivered and counted, and should in no way be misconstrued to imply that we lack confidence in our ability to deliver those ballots. We can, and will, handle the volume of election mail we receive," DeJoy told the House Oversight committee last week.

Kadra Sommersted-Simmons, a senior at Wayne State, said the sidewalk chalking has sparked some positive conversations about equality on campus, but some students have taken the chalking too far.
 “Regardless of what people are saying, I don’t think they should be writing stuff on the side of school buildings or on the rocks we have on display,” Sommersted-Simmons said. “It’s just diminishing what people are trying to accomplish within the campus community. But I guess some people feel that’s the only way others will hear their voices.”
 The sidewalk chalk has given the freedom for some people to express themselves without facing the backlash they otherwise would on social media or in the classroom, Sommersted-Simmons said, and she believes chalking gives students a peaceful opportunity to express what’s important to them.
 Wayne State has not publicly addressed the sidewalk chalk around campus, but some students said they believe a statement should be made by the administration as a way to let students know that their voices are heard and that the college is actively taking steps to promote inclusion across its entire student body.

“There are very serious questions now that only the Russian government can answer, and must answer,” Merkel said, who described what happened to Navalny as “the attempted murder by poisoning of one of Russia’s leading opposition figures.”


  Navalny, a politician and corruption investigator who is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critics, fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on Aug 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk after the plane made an emergency landing.


  He was transferred two days later to Berlin’s Charité hospital, where doctors last week said initial tests indicated Navalny had been poisoned.


  British authorities identified Novichok as the poison used in 2018 on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England. The nerve agent is a cholinesterase inhibitor, part of the class of substances that doctors at Charite said last week had shown up in Navalny’s system.


  German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the Russian ambassador was summoned to his ministry Wednesday and told in “unmistakable” terms of Germany’s call for the Navalny case to be investigated “in full and with full transparency.”


  “We now know that there was an attack with a chemical nerve agent,” Mass said. “That makes it even more urgent to determine who was responsible in Russia and to hold them to account.”


  The Kremlin remained tight-lipped and said it hadn’t been informed, even though its ambassador in Berlin had been summoned.


  The German government said it would inform its partners in the European Union and NATO about the test results. He said it wants to consult with them in light of the Russian response “on an appropriate joint response.” Germany also will contact the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

While America's Team figures to take one of the biggest hits in stadium revenue, even with fans on hand while other teams don't allow them, the Cowboys also are a symbol of the NFL at large — they should be fine in the long term.


  “The NFL is a juggernaut,” said David Steinberg, co-founder of Zeta Global, a company that analyzes advertising data for pro sports teams. “Other than maybe European (soccer), there’s no other league really globally like that. So I think that they are going to not just survive this. I think they will thrive in it.”


  The Green Bay Packers offer the only glimpse at NFL finances as a publicly owned team. Even with no fans all season, CEO Mark Murphy says the Packers can cover player costs with national revenue highlighted by media rights, which is about two-thirds of the club's overall revenue. Murphy also says the Packers have about $400 million in reserve.


  Most of the the league's 32 teams will start the season without fans. Both Los Angeles teams have announced plans to follow the model started by Korean baseball and adopted by Major League Baseball — fan cutouts in the seats when the new SoFi Stadium opens. Proceeds are going to charity.


  The league is allowing teams to sell sponsorships on tarps covering seats in the lower bowl between the 30-yard lines, capped at 16 spots. The end zone tarps are reserved for sponsors of both the club and the league.

“If those options arise (interest from Premier League clubs) it is something I’d look at for sure,” Bale told Sky Sports.


  “We’ll see what happens, we have plenty of time in this transfer window and a couple of others as well. Time will tell but mainly I think the reason is that the decision is in Real Madrid’s hands.


  “I tried to leave last year but they blocked everything at the last second. It was a project I was excited for but it didn’t materialise.


  “There have been other instances where we have tried to go but the club won’t allow it or they’ve done something. It’s down to the club.


  “I want to play football, I am still motivated to play football, so I guess it’s on the club. They are in control of everything. I have a contract, all I can do is carry on what I am doing and hopefully something comes up.


  “I am only 31 still but I feel I am in great shape still and feel like I have a lot to give. We will see what happens. It’s in the club’s hands but they make things very difficult to be honest.”

Twitter and Facebook make it all too easy to shine a spotlight on outlier events and present them as central to our lives. The focus on the ludicrous “autonomous zone” in Seattle earlier this summer let the right claim the whole city was like a “Mad Max” movie.


  Similarly, the statistically rare (I’m sorry, but it’s true) examples of outrageously bad behavior by some cops captured on video give many on the left permission to push a narrative of wholesale racial oppression by police.


  Social media is like the wall on Plato’s Cave. Selective facts cast shadows we mistake for reality.


  If you take all your cues about what’s happening in America from partisan Twitter, as so many journalists do, you’d be a fool not to buy a gun and prepare for the coming apocalyptic helter-skelter.


  The problem is intensified by the tendency of the hyper-politically engaged left and right to listen only to people in their own echo chamber and to mistake Twitter outrage for sentiment on the ground.


  So despite the fact that a majority of Black and Latino people want the same amount or more police in their communities, we spent weeks listening to “experts” claim that “abolish the police” is a reasonable, mainstream position. (Here’s an illustrative heuristic:


  If you hear politicians or journalists using the label “Latinx” to describe Latinos, you’re listening to someone in a bubble. According to recent Pew Research Center polling, only about 25% of Latinos know the term and only about 3% actually use it.


  Joe Biden won the Democratic nomination largely because most of his competitors talked as if primary voters were indistinguishable from the very online left-wing activists and journalists who dominate MSNBC and CNN.


  To his credit, Biden has unequivocally condemned rioting, vigilantism and street violence.


  But he took too much time to do it, not because he doesn’t believe what he said, but because the campaign let the fringe define the center of the party.


  Condemning violence — by rioters and vigilantes alike — is a no-brainer; it’s a pre-partisan patriotic requirement of political leadership.


  Hesitation to do so is not merely shameful, it’s political malpractice, because most voters expect it and even the appearance of reluctance feeds precisely the narrative that could cost Biden the election.

We know less of Steven Lawless but it looks very much as if he was on the radar under Nigel Clough’s managership and it will not have escaped Lawless’s attention how good a move the Brewers have proved for a string of Scottish players looking to try their luck in England.


  On paper, then, it looks a decent squad, although it may yet get a couple more additions, not least a goalkeeper. Buxton has all of his loan places to play with, which is a healthy position to be in. Results and performances have been promising and, if nothing else, will have got the players used to playing with no-one watching.


  They began with a 2-1 win against Mansfield Town, with Hemmings getting off the mark early, and followed up with a 1-1 draw against Nottingham Forest Under-23s, with Ben Fox lashing in a first-time finish as he returns from a year out with injury. Hemmings scored again against Leicester City Under-23s but two late goals from the Foxes youngsters handed Burton a 2-1 defeat.


  The highlight of pre-season was a 1-0 win away to Championship side Stoke City next, with Hemmings on target again, turning Vernam’s shot into the net for a classic poacher’s goal. Hemmings added two more smart finishes against Coventry City next to take his pre-season tally to five. He appears to have the bit between his teeth and looks as single-minded as a striker should be when the goal is in his sights.


  A 1-1 draw on Saturday against Walsall fizzled out somewhat in the second half after John Brayford’s tap-in cancelled out Walsall’s early goal. These games often can when there are a large number of substitutions and it will not have troubled Buxton unduly, after he turned out a notably less strong starting 11.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Both President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden will commemorate the 19th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in rural Pennsylvania where one of the hijacked planes crashed in a field, the White House and Biden's campaign announced Wednesday.
 It was not immediately clear whether their visits to the memorial in Shanksville will overlap. But it probably will be the closest that the candidates have been to one another in months.
 The National Park Service, which co-hosts the annual memorial event, is planning an abbreviated ceremony this year to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. The agency plans a 20-minute “Moment of Remembrance" set to begin at 9:45 a.m., without a keynote speaker or musical guests. The name of each passengers and crew member from Flight 93 will be read aloud with the ringing of the “Bells of Remembrance," according to the agency's website.
 A White House spokesman, Judd Deere, said the president and first lady Melania Trump would visit the site “to honor and remember the lives lost” on Sept. 11, 2001. Trump is expected to speak, although the White House and Park Service did not immediately reconcile that with the planned commemoration.
 In 2016, Trump and Democratic president nominee Hillary Clinton both spent Sept 11 in New York and both visited the Ground Zero memorial in lower Manhattan. The day ended up being a significant one on the campaign, after Clinton abruptly left the ceremony, complaining she was overheated, and was captured on video struggling to step into a van.
 The 2,200-acre Flight 93 National Memorial marks the spot in rural Pennsylvania where the hijacked flight crashed, killing all 40 people on board. Three other planes hijacked that day were crashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon. Nearly 3,000 people died in the attacks.
 It's the second time Trump will mark 9/11 with a visit to the site. He also visited the Pentagon and 2017 and 2019.

The report further notes that detainees held by Syrian Regime forces are subjected to exceptionally brutal and sadistic methods of torture, and subjected to unimaginably squalid, unsanitary and massively overcrowded conditions in its detention centers without even the bare minimum of hygiene or sanitation to protect against illness and disease. The report also notes that these brutal conditions being a very deliberate and widespread strategy on the part of the Syrian regime with the aim of debasing and torturing detainees. Subjecting detainees to conditions that foster disease and infection and leaving them to suffer without medical help or treatment is another deliberate and conscious part of this strategy, forcing already physically and emotionally traumatized detainees to endure an additional layer of torment and debasement often leading to death. The report warns of the increasing danger facing prisoners in regime detention centers with the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in light of the brutal detention conditions that are favorable for the spread of infectious diseases such as the COVID-19 coronavirus; this now threatens the lives of approximately 130,000 people who are still documented as being detained or forcibly disappeared by Syrian Regime forces, according to the SNHR database.

North Bay council has awarded a nearly $600,000 contract for a new transit fare system that will see new fare boxes installed and allow customers to buy passes through a mobile device.
 Council approved the $592,000 contract Tuesday, plus HST, to Solutions ITSMAX Inc. from Candiac, Que., near Montreal.
 The company, which scored the highest out of three bids submitted to the city, will be responsible for installing new fare boxes and putting in place an electronic fare-management system, which will include ongoing software licensing, support and upgrades for a period of five years.
 The contract may be extended for an additional two terms of up to one year each.
 "It's certainly an interesting project to be involved with and I look forward to this coming forward in transit and supported by council," said Coun. Chris Mayne, who chairs the city's infrastructure and operations committee which oversees transit.
 The new system would allow transit riders to continue paying by cash, while adding new electronic payment options.
 A staff report prepared for council says the system will eliminate the current paper passes and replace them with electronic reloadable "tap" cards, with the option of buying passes and rides through a mobile device.
 Transfers will be held on the electronic card in most cases or be replaced with printed QR codes, meaning paper-based transfers also will be eliminated and expiry times will be verified electronically.
 Along with "no-touch" transactions, the report says the system will create more accurate fare accounts, speed up transaction times and significantly reduce the use of paper.
 "So there are savings to be had when you're not spending so much on paper in the long term," Coun. Mike Anthony said.
 A mobile fare payment app may be used to accept payments from a customer and produce a scannable QR code that will be read and registered by the fare box.
 A fare-scanning system also will be added to Parabus.

The case is expected to now move to the state 1st Circuit Court of Appeal in Baton Rouge — where Greene's mother, Toni Higginbotham, is a sitting judge — and then to the Louisiana Supreme Court in New Orleans. Cases are randomly assigned to judges at the 1st Circuit, though Higginbotham would be expected to decline a spot on a panel hearing her daughter's case.
 The state Constitution sets a mandatory retirement age of 70 for judges but allows them to serve out the remainder of their terms if they reach that age while in office.
 Greene, who was beaten by Matthews by a nearly 2-1 margin, filed a petition Aug. 24 alleging Matthews is "constitutionally barred" from taking office because she was elected after passing Louisiana's mandatory retirement age for judges in early June.
 Greene, who is representing herself in the case, pressed that argument Wednesday during a Zoom hearing that Morvant conducted.
 The judge pointed out that the City Court election had initially been set for the spring, when Matthews was 69. The contest was reset for July because of the coronavirus pandemic, and Matthews turned 70 before the new election day.
 "If the election had gone as scheduled, Mrs. Matthews could have taken office immediately after the May 9 (runoff) election," he said. "Through no fault of her own, but for the pandemic, she would have taken office already."
 Morvant cited two recent Louisiana Supreme Court decisions — one involving fellow 19th Judicial District Court Judge Richard "Chip" Moore and the other the state bar exam — in which the high court also took the pandemic into consideration in its reasoning.

SPRINGFIELD — The 1st Congressional District primary between winner, incumbent U.S. Rep. Richard Neal, and the challenger, Holyoke Mayor Alex B. Morse, had a turning point.
 But it wasn’t the point some folks might think.
 Paul Robbins, owner of the strategic communications firm Paul Robbins Associates, said the turning point was on March 3 when Joe Biden won the Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary over two progressive senators — Bernie Sanders of Vermont and home-state favorite Elizabeth Warren. Biden won without setting foot in the state or spending any money.
 “Right then and there, if I was Alex Morse I’d have said ‘whoops’,” Robbins said Wednesday.
 Biden’s win, and rise to be the Democratic nominee and current front runner in national polls to defeat President Donald Trump in November is fueled not by the progressive zeal behind Warren and Sanders.
 “From the time that Alex conceived of this campaign, the world has changed,” Robbins said. “People are more focused on meat and potatoes.”
 It’s a desire to return to normalcy, Robbins said. And a recognition among Democratic voters that they need someone to fight for them.
 Morse ran almost a national campaign focused on Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.
 “But the reality is, I think people thought ’Alright, we need to save Social Security and Medicare. Who am I going to have in Washington fighting for that?’,” Robbins said. “People decided Congressman Neal.”
 Neal is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, one of the most powerful committees in Congress responsible for tax policy, tariffs and revenue raising.
 Matt Szafranski, editor and chief of the Western Mass Politics and Insight blog, said the race also exposes the gulf between social media — Twitter and Facebook — where Morse did well, and the real world of longtime relationships where Neal clearly had the edge. The real world is where the vote is.
 Neal defeated Morse Tuesday by 24,600 votes or about 60% of the vote to 40% of the vote: 81,485 to 56,787.
 “I just think the district is made up of folks who are comfortable with Congressman Neal, who like the way he’s doing his job and value to clout hat he wields,” said Tim Vercellotti, a professor of political science and pollster at Western New England University. “There just aren’t enough progressives to turn him out.”
 Neal won every major population center in the district — including Morse’ hometown of Holyoke by more than 400 votes — with Morse taking liberal resort communities in southern Berkshire County and a few enclaves in Franklin and Hampshire counties.
 In Springfield, Neal’s home base and the place where he was mayor and councilman, his team was able to get out the vote.
 The voter turnout was 26.89% in Springfield on Tuesday, significantly higher than in recent state primaries with the addition of early voting, according to election records.
 There were 27,652 ballots cast out of 102,810 registered voters, when combining both early voting and Election Day voting.
 In the 2018 state primary, voter turnout was 13.24% and the turnout in 2016 was 12.83%.
 On Tuesday, Neal won Springfield 65.3% to 34.6%, or 15,861 to 8,395 votes.
 But some of Morse’s support may have resided outside the district.
 Vercellotti was poll worker in Northampton Tuesday, a city represented by U.S. Rep. James McGovern, D-Worcester, who was unopposed. Vercellotti said Northamptonites brought their Democratic ballots back to the check-in table asking where they could vote on the Neal and Morse race.
 “It dominated the political discussion,” Vercellotti said.
 This race was 10 points closer than Neal’s most recent primary challenge in 2018 where his opponent spent about a tenth as much money.
 Vercellotti said there is no exit polling saying what issues mattered the most to voters and there wasn’t even that much predictive polling publicly released prior to the election.
 The Morse campaign released some internal polls showing he was within 10 points.
 But Vercellotti said congressional primaries in the summer are hard to poll. There is no good way to figure out who the likely voters are and its too hard to get a good sample of respondents. Add to that the confusion surrounding the pandemic. Early voting and mail -in voting meant the race might have been decided prior to a last-minute push.
 But its also a race with so many confounding variables that observers have a hard time picking apart which ones had what effect. The pandemic made it hard to host rallies, but easier to vote from home, jobs losses and economic turmoil put the focus on Neal’s work on Ways and Means.
 And in August, the Daily Collegian newspaper at the University of Massachusetts Amherst reported that college Democrats there complained to Morse in a letter that his communications with college students on dating apps made some members uncomfortable.
 Later, another college Democrat said some of the allegations may have stemmed from a desire to help Neal.
 Morse and his campaign said the Springfield Democratic machine was behind the letter, though Neal and his campaign have both said that he was not involved.
 The controversy raised Morse’s profile, landing him a sympathetic piece in the New York Times and helping him to raise $1 million in August.
 But Robbins said it hurt him in that the only way to win a campaign is to play offense, not defense.
 There is a lot of speculation as to whether the hotly contested Senate primary between U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III and the winner, incumbent Ed Markey, hurt Morse and helped Neal or vice versa.
 But John Baick, a professor of history at Western New England University said its not a question of whether a Markey voter was a Morse voter but about how the Markey campaign — which was more progressive than Kennedy — took up enthusiasm, volunteer hours and dollars that Morse could have used.
 Also, Morse more than Neal was hurt by the inability to have rallies and meeting for much of the campaign.
 One of Morse’s digs at Neal was that the congressman has not offered town hall meetings throughout his district. The way to drive that point home would be to have a half-dozen gathering a day over months.
 “Morse had been working hard at this for a while. And he was just limited,” Baick said.
 Neal for his part said he plans to focus on Social Security, Medicare and getting the coronavirus under control so the economy can recovery. In his victory speech Tuesday, he referred to getting legislation on the desk of “President Biden.”
 The congressional race and the UMass allegations gave Morse a national profile that might open up opportunities.
 Morse certainly is giving no indication he is going away anytime soon.
 “If one thing is clear, I know that we’re not done yet,” Morse tweeted to his supporters Wednesday.
 Szafranski said there is speculation that Morse won’t run for mayor again in 2021. But time will tell.
 Baick said it is worrisome for Morse that he was beat Holyoke on Tuesday. And politicians often pay the price for taking their eyes off the job they have and paying too much attention on the job they want. (Morse has already been criticized for missing School Committee meetings.)
 Szafranski said redistricting after the 2020 census might make it harder for Morse. All congressional districts will be different in 2022, redrawn to reflect new population patterns.
 In Massachusetts that means a shift to the east where the Boston area suburbs have grown.
 Could Neal use his pull in the legislature to shed some left-leaning towns Morse won to the district now represented by McGovern. Then, Neal would pick up towns he once represented in the Blackstone River Valley, a part of Worcester County that’s conservative enough to avoid Morse but not conservative enough to allow for a serious Republican challenger.

“Unlike typically in the private sector, the U.S. government does not need any reason to terminate an agreement,” Klink said. “We can confidently say that we have delivered on our commitments. While we are disappointed in light of our massive efforts, we will work with HHS to effectuate the partial termination of this contract.”

ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- As eight Navy midshipmen file into their economics class, instructor Kurtis Swope points to the antibacterial wipes on the desk. "Did you grab wipes?" he asks, then tells each one to take two, wipe down the desk when they arrive and again when they leave. "That should be your process."


   


  As chairman of U.S. Naval Academy's economics department, Swope broke his class into two sections, so every student could attend in person. Down the hall another instructor, flanked by chemistry equipment, stands in front of two computers teaching in an empty classroom. And another instructor sits in her office, talking to a grid of camo-clad students on her laptop.


   


  Under the siege of the coronavirus pandemic, classes have begun at the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. But unlike at many colleges around the country, most students are on campus and many will attend classes in person.


   


  This is largely due to advantages the military schools have. They're small, each with about 4,500 students who know that joining the military means they're subject to more control and expected to follow orders. Their military leaders, meanwhile, are treating the virus like an enemy that must be detected, deterred and defeated. They view the students as the next generation of commanders who must learn to lead troops through any crisis, including this one.


   


  "If you look at COVID as a threat, it helps you frame it in a way that I think you can then conduct action against it," said Brig. Gen. Curtis Buzzard, West Point's commandant. The cadets, he said, are getting lessons in "leading through uncertainty and adversity. I've had to do that throughout my career in the Army, particularly in combat, and they're getting a little dose of it."


   


  The virus outbreak sent most academy students home to finish spring semester online. Air Force seniors stayed and graduated early.


   


  Now students have returned, and 1% to 2% tested COVID-19 positive on arrival and went into isolation. Since then, officials say they've seen few new cases. The Navy and Air Force will randomly test 15% of students weekly; West Point will test 15% to 20% monthly.


   


  Because they need dozens of on-campus rooms to potentially isolate COVID students or quarantine those who come in contact with infected persons, the Navy and Air Force academies are renting space off-site for healthy students. The Navy, in Annapolis, Maryland, is putting 375 students at St. John's College and the Air Force, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, will put 400 in three local hotels.


   


  "We know that with this population that about 90% of this age group is asymptomatic," said Brig. Gen. Linell A. Letendre, Air Force Academy dean. "That's what's really scary about this disease. How do we find those individuals who have it when they don't even know they have it."


   


  To limit any spread, the academies made physical and academic changes. At the Navy's Michelson Hall, blue tape marks seats that must remain empty, red tape forms large arrows on the floor showing students which way to go, and stairways are designated up or down. Signs remind students about social distancing. Library books borrowed online sit in paper bags for pick-up.


   


  The Navy has the smallest campus, but two large tents were wedged next to the dorm for dining. The Air Force and Army, however, have been able to create large outdoor classrooms and meeting areas.


   


  "I wanted outdoor classrooms for a long time and we're finally getting them," said Letendre. "I never waste a good crisis."


   


  At West Point, instructors tested their classroom air quality. They added time between classes for cleaning. And faculty walk the halls to ensure students follow health procedures.


   


  The Army and Navy academies will limit students' movements off campus. That may be difficult, since the tourist-filled restaurants and bars of Annapolis' waterfront are nearby. Air Force leaders said they'll let students go to stores or take-out restaurants initially, but will clamp down if there are COVID cases.


   


  "I don't know that anyone else can demand the same things we do with respect to self-discipline. That's just part of being in an academy," said Col. Matthew Dabkowski, director of West Point's systems engineering program. "There's a level of control with respect to the staff and faculty and the cadets that, I think, is helpful."


   


  Academy officials said roughly 50% of their classes will be in-person, the rest will be online or a mix. Some students will attend in person more often if they have lab work.


   


  Students attending academies also need hands-on military experience. The virus made some of that impossible this year, and some students missed critical time in military units or on ships.


   


  "You can do academic course work online. We can teach online," said Andrew Phillips, Naval Academy provost. "But the professional experiences they missed this summer are very hard to make up."


   


  Phillips said most juniors who must pick their service specialty now didn't get out to active-duty units but will, he hopes, choose wisely. Navy students heading to the Marine Corps, however, got a shortened summer experience because Marine leaders felt strongly about seeing them in person.


   


  "You want an individual who is a good fit for the Marine Corps, whose attitude is right," Phillips said. "And you really only can judge that face to face."


   


  Technology is also a challenge, with thousands online for classes. Many instructors want students to have their cameras on, which requires more bandwidth.


   


  Swope, for example, has one computer set up showing his online students; his iPhone camera faces the class, so they are visible online, and his iPad displays his lessons.


   


  Instructors have to be ready to provide online classes to students in isolation, and also be prepared to teach from home if they're quarantined. Celeste Luning started her junior leadership class at the Naval Academy seeking volunteers to set up the computers if she's not there.


   


  "Have you had in-person classes yet?" Luning asks. Amid the chorus of "no," she turns to her computer to address those online: "Can you see your classmates?"


   


  One voice from the computer sums it up. "It's pretty weird," he said.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Jerry Jones won't put a number on the attendance for the Dallas Cowboys' home opener until the crowd is announced later this month at AT&T Stadium.


  The owner of the Cowboys also hopes the 80,000-seat venue with standing room space that pushes capacity past 90,000 will be closer to full as the pandemic- altered NFL season goes on.


  All of which is to say the league's clubs are preparing for a rapidly changing environment while accepting the bottom-line notion that playing games with limited numbers of fans or none at all will affect revenues in 2020.


  “You think about the lost revenue that these teams have across the board with no fans in the building,” said Bill Rhoda, president of global planning for Legends, a stadium operations company co-owned by the Cowboys and New York Yankees.


  “And it goes from tickets to the concessions, to the merchandise to the game, to the lack of private suites being used, which then has an impact on sponsorships. So there is a trickle-down effect that this virus has had on the industry as a whole.”


  Specifics are hard to get because clubs don't disclose or discuss them. According to 2018 figures estimated by Forbes magazine, the Cowboys pulled about two-thirds of their $950 million in revenue from the stadium.

The flame was unveiled in a small ceremony Monday and went on display for the public at the Japan Olympic museum Tuesday, the Associated Press reports. Last week, athletes were back at the National Stadium for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic put a pause on the Games, with widespread effects for athletes and the host country. Those athletes competed in the Golden Grand Prix, a track and field event that featured only Japanese athletes this year instead of those from around the world.
