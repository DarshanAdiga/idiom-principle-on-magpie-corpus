"This is testament to the concerted effort the service has made in surface dressing 1,000 miles of Suffolk's roads and to fix smaller potholes, faster.
 "It is also positive to see the public feel our network is more accessible, especially in respect to those living with disabilities.
 "This aside, there is more that needs to be done to ensure Suffolk's residents and visitors can continue benefitting from well-maintained highways. We will be reviewing all response data and using this to inform an action plan."
 Despite the improvements, opinion over signposting of diversions had fallen by 3% down to 49% while 46% felt cycle route information was adequate - 2% down on 2018.
 According to the report, the winter of 2017/18 was the worst for a decade which caused a rapid deterioration of the road surface in many areas.
 It prompted a blitz of potholes, tackling three times as many potholes than usual from May-September 2018.
 Councillor Jack Owen, Labour spokesman for highways, at Suffolk County Council, said: "I have to be frank and say that I agree with these survey results - Suffolk's roads are simply not up to scratch. In fact, they are pretty dreadful in places.
 "This survey shows that two-thirds of people in Suffolk are not satisfied with the roads they use every day which is pretty damning. Although there has been a small rise in satisfaction, it is still down on the 2017 figures, which themselves were nothing to write home about.
 "We need to see rapid improvements on a road network which is a long way from being fit for purpose."

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — A board member under fire for allegedly swindling an Indian tribe in Oklahoma. The organization’s $3 million Kansas City headquarters, bought and renovated just a few years ago, up for sale. The founder stepping away from day-to-day control. A CEO abruptly leaving after only a few months at the helm. That’s the state of the Kansas City Barbeque Society, the world’s largest organization dedicated to promoting barbeque, which appears to be in turmoil more than three decades after its founding in 1986, KCUR-FM reported. The society sanctions more than 500 barbeque contests each year, including the American Royal in Kansas City, and is viewed as the premier supporter and sanctioning body of its hometown’s most famous export. A non-profit group with roughly 17,000 dues-paying members worldwide, KCBS is in debt, according to tax records, and is selling its 44,000-square foot “world” headquarters building near downtown. KCBS purchased the building in late 2016 and then spent a lot of money renovating it. In 2017, KCBS valued the property at roughly $3 million. The group’s CEO, Heath Hall, left under murky circumstances in July after just seven months on the job and other longtime, loyal directors appear to be jumping ship. Hall, a Kansas City native and former U.S. Senate staffer who co-founded Pork Barrel BBQ, a producer and marketer of barbeque sauces and spice rubs, reached a confidential settlement with the organization. He could not be reached for comment. The society's CEO, Emily Detwiler, didn't return phone calls and an email seeking comment. Some former society board members blame the organization’s current problems on David Qualls, the secretary of the society’s board, who is being sued by the Peoria Tribe of Oklahoma for misappropriating more than $2 million in...

 The Arrows won the meet with a score of 144.85. Host Huron followed at 129.55 and Britton-Hecla was third at 110.3.
 “It was maybe just a tiny bit disappointing,” said Watertown head coach Vicky Fisher. “Our bars and beam weren’t up to par, but we finished out the meet really well on the floor and vault.”
