Germany, the world's third-largest exporter and also signatory to the convention, only conducts "moderate enforcement," as do other major exporters like France, Italy and Spain.
 Germany and Italy both pursued fewer cases in 2019 than in the previous year, while France and Spain improved their performance.
 The Netherlands, Canada and Austria — all signatories to the convention — are the biggest exporters in the category of those showing only "limited enforcement."
 "Too many governments choose to turn a blind eye when their companies use bribery to win business in foreign markets," Transparency International head Delia Ferreira Rubio said. "G-20 countries and other major economies have a responsibility to enforce the rules."
 Transparency's recommendations include ending secrecy in ownership of companies, which makes investigating foreign bribery difficult, and exploring increased liability of parent companies for the actions of their foreign subsidiaries.

But his deficit in Wisconsin remains stubborn. And campaign aides acknowledge that even winning that battleground will not provide the needed votes if Biden claims Florida or the traditionally red state of Arizona.
 The president's travel this week reflects that bind. He's visiting the three battleground states he likely can't win without — Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina — as well as states he once thought were in his grasp — Iowa and Georgia — but where he now needs to play defense in light of recent polling showing Biden improving.
 Trump traveled to Pennsylvania twice in the week before he tested positive for the coronavirus. With 20 electoral votes, the state is anchored by large cities — Philadelphia to the east, Pittsburgh to the west. But the rest of Pennsylvania is largely rural, comprised of small cities and towns where Trump ran up the score four years ago. He will need to again, in even greater numbers, as his prospects have slipped since 2016 in vote-rich suburban Philadelphia, where he underperformed by past Republican measures.
 That helps explain why Trump is holding a rally Tuesday at the airport in Johnstown in Cambria County, a historic coal and steel area that narrowly backed Barack Obama in 2008. But it has trended Republican for the past three decades and, in the 2016 election, Trump scored a 37 percentage-point victory. It is substantially whiter and has lower median incomes and lower rates of college-degree attainment than the rest of Pennsylvania.
 Biden has also visited Johnstown, staging a drive-in rally at the train station while touring parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania by rail late last month. The former vice president has tried to cast himself as a champion of working- class voters while he accuses Trump of focusing on stock market returns and Park Avenue values. Biden says he would like to reduce Republican advantages in conservative areas, even if he cannot win them outright.
 "If we just cut the margin, it makes a gigantic difference," Biden said after his Johnstown rally. "A lot of white working-class Democrats thought we forgot them and didn't pay attention."
 Despite the pandemic, Trump's campaign has prioritized in-person events and aggressive door-knocking as it tries to turn out new and low propensity voters, including more members of the white working class who may have backed Democrats in the past but now favor the president.
 Republicans point to an aging population and a shrinking voter-registration edge for Democrats, down 20% from 2016's election to 717,000, according to the latest Pennsylvania data.

I recently read that "fewer than 1% of our population works hard to divide us, to pit people against one another for their selfish aim."
   
 We have elections at our doorsteps. Much of the election advertisements are trying to pit us against each other.
   
 It seems that each election the voter turnout is slight - generally less than 50% of the registered voters. Yet the vote decides who is going to govern us. That power to govern includes state and local taxation; education of our children; health care; Medicare benefits; Social Security benefits; how to deal with pandemics; providing for our safety and our security; and creating laws and policies that will support or devastate our economy.
   
 It includes the power to wage, or not to wage, war; to give and take away our freedoms; to control the very fabric of our day-to-day lives.
   
 Yet, we still have people who do not vote.
   
 I have an agenda when I vote. I want my rights and my clients' rights to be protected. I want my clients not to worry about healthcare. I want there to be adequate and affordable health services for them.
   
 I want them to have financial security. I want their businesses, farms, retirement, Social Security, and Medicare to be protected. I want them to be safe in their homes; I want them to be safe outside their homes.
   
 I also want certain fundamental rights protected for those who may be of limited means or maybe a member of a minority group, as well as those who have a not so popular religion or lifestyle. I want to be sure that we have all the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution and Bill of Rights - including free speech, the right to vote, privacy, and a free press.
   
 So, that is my agenda. That is my test.
   
 Let me add something that my grandfather taught me - do not trust someone who continues to lie, no matter how big or small the lie. Walk away from that person. That too is part of my litmus test of a candidate, and whether I will support that candidate. Regardless of what that candidate proclaims as his/her beliefs, if the candidate lies, I am out of there.
   
 Some encourage us not to vote. They make it more difficult to vote. They imply that as older Americans we somehow don't matter.
   
 I am one of the greys now. Greys Matter. You matter. Your vote matters.
   
 Create your own agenda, your own litmus test. Your agenda may be a lot different than mine. That is fine. We will not cancel each other out. Vote for the person that most matches your agenda. Vote for someone you trust; someone who has earned that trust. No candidate is perfect, but we cannot just give up by not voting. Vote in person or by mail. Call the County Clerk in your county if you have questions.
   
 We greys matter. Vote.

The Bledsoe-related messaging has also been reflected by Harrison himself. On Monday night, he reminded MSNBC host Joy Reid “there are three people on the ballot” for the election: “It’s Lindsey Graham, myself and Bill Bledsoe, who’s a Constitution Party candidate. He’s also listed on the ballot.”


  Harrison’s campaign confirmed to The Associated Press that it was funding the ads and the state Democratic Party was paying for the website, calling both “standard, routine advertisements.”


  Harrison spokesman Guy King told AP that the campaign is simply “making sure voters know the facts” about Harrison’s “two opponents on the ballot.”


  Bledsoe technically ended his campaign earlier this month, however, to back Graham, as Harrison began to rise in polling and fundraising. But Bledsoe acted too late to remove his name from ballots, and with the three candidates listed in alphabetical order, his name appears at the top of the list.

 At the time, Aucca said, international nongovernmental organizations lamented the way communities were destroying wildlife habitats, yet they resisted engaging those communities in their conservation efforts, seeing that as social work, not conservation.
 Aucca disagreed. He thought it was vital to work with people who lived in the area, to get them invested, and to ensure they benefited as well.
 Proponents of community-based conservation argue efforts to protect biodiversity are more successful when their goals align with those of the local people, and when those people are actively involved.
 "It is a fundamental strategy for conservation to involve local people," said Mariana Montoya, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society in Peru. "Conservation should be done that way -- not just working with or for communities, conservation must be done _by_ communities."
 Aucca asked the residents of Pomacochas what they wanted in exchange for letting him reserve a parcel of land for conservation, and they said trees that would provide shade for their cows.
 He told them: "This will provide food, trees, money and happiness."
 It took time to gain the locals' trust. To reforest the area, ECOAN set up a tree nursery nearby. At first, Aucca had to pay landowners to let him plant seedlings on their property. But local leaders, including a farmer named Santos Montenegro who was particularly adept at spotting spatuletails on his property, helped spread an understanding of why restoring and protecting the habitat was good not just for animals, but for the community -- including improving pastureland and prohibiting development that could pollute watersheds.

It took five sets, but the Greeneville volleyball team figured things out late to earn its first trip to the Region 1-2A championship match since 2016.


  The Lady Devils took down Sullivan South 25-20, 24-26, 25-21, 20-25, 15-5 in the region semifinals on Monday and will now look ahead to a championship matchup with Sullivan Central.


  “I’m just proud of these girls,” Greeneville coach Erin Franklin said. “They came in strong and aggressive with confidence. It got hairy in the middle, but they finished strong. I felt South started playing safe in the end, and we got more aggressive. That made the difference.”


  Greeneville will host Sullivan Central at 6 p.m. Tuesday with a chance to play at home in the state sectionals on the line. Sullivan Central beat Seymour 3-2 in Monday’s other semifinal.


  Tuesday’s winner will be at home against the Region 2-2A runner-up in the state sectionals while the loser on Tuesday will visit the Region 2-2A champion with a chance to go to the state tournament on the line.


  Region 2-2A will play both semifinals and its championship game on Tuesday. Grainger will play Carter and Anderson County will play Knoxville Central.


  “These girls are so excited,” Franklin said. “I told them we’re going to sectionals, but tomorrow is for home-court advantage. It’s huge that we get the region championship at home and in front of our fans. I think they give us a big advantage and hopefully we can use it.”


  The Lady Devils traded points with Sullivan South through the first four sets on Monday, but in the fifth and deciding set they found a new energy.


  The set started with Takiya Curry and Nikkayla Stewart picking up a pair of blocks for a 2-0 lead. Greeneville’s lead moved to 6-1 after Chloe Marsh put down a pair of kills, and from there Greeneville never lost control.


  “We jumped on that fifth set from the start and it helped to get us in front early,” Franklin said. “They made the adjustment on the block and with defense. Then I think once we had the lead we loosened up and were able to play strong.”


  South got within 8-5 when Bradlie Warner came up with an ace. Jocelyn Gillespie answered with a kill and the Lady Rebels followed with three errors for a 12-5 Greeneville lead.


  Lauren Bailey scored on a tip and Chloe Marsh finished the set at the service line for a 15-5 victory.


  Greeneville stared the day by jumping to a 10-1 lead in the first set. Stewart and Bailey each had blocks while Stewart put down two aces in the run.


  Two kills by Marsh and another by Stewart gave Greeneville a 13-3 lead, but South kept fighting.


  A kill and a tip by Riley Haynie along with an ace by Rachel Miller closed the gap to 13-9.


  A kill by Gillespie and two Sullivan South errors gave the Lady Devils a 20-11 advantage.


  The Lady Rebels clawed back, but Bailey slammed a kill to break their run while giving Greeneville a 25-20 win.


  The second set saw five ties in the early going with the last coming at 11-11. Then four straight missed kill opportunities by the Lady Rebels put Greeneville in front 16-11.


  Greeneville led 19-13, but South refused to go down. An ace by Allie Jordan put the Lady Rebels in front 22-21.


  Marsh tied the set for the final time 24-24, but a block by Chloe Nelson and a kill by Miller gave the Lady Rebels a 26-24 win.


  In the third set, Greeneville had to shake off a slow start as it found itself trailing 7-4. A kill by Ansley Inscore tied things 8-8 and a tough free-ball save by Inscore tied things again 9-9.


  A tip by Gillespie got Greeneville over the top at 14-13. Gillespie then caught fire the net and pounded a trio of consecutive kills for a 21-14 Greeneville lead.


  After two kills by Miller closed the gap to 24-21 Jules Aiken finished things by dumping a second hit into a defensive void to secure the 25-21 Greeneville win.


  Despite Greeneville starting the fourth set with two kills from Stewart and one each from Curry and Marsh for a 5-1 lead, Sullivan South was able to take the fourth set 25-20 and tie the match 2-2.


  Four errors by Greeneville tied the set 5-5. A run that saw Miller put down three kills then gave South a 17-14 lead. Greeneville could never challenge for the lead after that.


  Greenville was balanced at the net. Stewart had 12 kills and five blocks, Curry and Gillespie each had 10 kills, Bailey had nine kills and five blocks and Marsh had nine kills.


  Jules Aiken had 25 assists and 10 digs, and Eden Aiken had 23 assists. Emma Renner had 20 digs and Stewart added 10 digs.

Why the confusion? Record keeping and self-mythologizing, mostly. When its namesake fell from power, the original Pasha watch supposedly disappeared. In 1943, a Cartier special order featured a watch with a rounded case and a steel cage to protect the glass. And 42 years later, in 1985, a watch bearing a striking resemblance to that timepiece--brought to life by Gerald Genta, the legendary watch designer behind heavy hitters like the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak and the Patek Philippe Nautilus--hit the market. Its name? The Pasha de Cartier. How the name became associated with the special order and not the rectangular 1933 one-off is debatable. What seems certain is that in 1985, in order to take a bold step away from classic Cartier shapes, the maison leaned on the rounded--and, frankly, more interesting--1943 model.

Is the glass half empty or half full? It is believed that those who see the glass as half full tend to be more optimistic and those who see the glass as half empty are more pessimistic.

 I have enjoyed several webinars through Illinois Extension that focused on being positive and aging. Extensive research has shown that optimism improves well-being and physical health. Studies also show that resilience and optimism are associated with greater longevity. Another study found that when employees are positive, there is a 12% increase in productivity.
   
 Are there things we can do to stay positive? Yes, there are. However, I have found that some of the suggestions on the list have been much more difficult to do the last six months. That means we will just have to work a little harder on staying positive.
   
 The first suggestion is to be around positive people and those who support you. While it is not possible to always be around positive people, be aware of those who bring out the best in you versus those who bring out the worst in you. If possible, find a way to limit the time you have to spend with the difficult people.
   
 Laugh and surround yourself with things that help relieve stress. Doctors tell us that the physiological effects of laughter affect every part of the body. When we laugh, the heart rate and blood pressure speed up. Afterward, these sink below the previous levels and we feel a sense of relaxation. Author, Norman Cousins, was faced with a life-threatening disease but when he had a good belly laugh it allowed him to least two hours of pain-free relief.
   
 Another suggestion is to practice positive self-talk. We most likely all have negative thoughts and self-talk, but it is possible to train your brain to turn it around. Instead of saying, "I've never done it before" try "It's an opportunity to try something new." Positive self-talk does take practice but we can mold ourselves through our thoughts. If you don't listen to and believe what you have to say, then who should you listen to?
   
 One last thought is to practice being grateful. Work to find the small things that make you happy. At the end of the day, try to list three things that you are thankful for. Write them down in a gratitude journal or record them in a gratitude app. If you take the time to do this, it will become obvious there are many, many things to be thankful for. If life becomes difficult, look back at your gratitude journal and savor the memories.

Part 1/3. To say the least, this has been a chaotic, stressful, weird, confusing, uneasy year. But because it was spent with the smartest - most caring -best sense of humor having - so pretty I get stunned every time I look at - perfect woman in the world, it has been the best year of my life. Our trip to Hawaii on this day last year, will be a memory I cherish for the rest of my life. I will be forever grateful for how caring you were during one of the most emotionally exhausting months of my life while living in Australia together last December. I wouldn’t have been able to create my most proud project last January without your constant support. When we were forced to quarantine together and be attached at the hip for an additional 5 months longer than we planned… I wasn’t even mad😌 When you had to go back to Australia without knowing when we’d be able to see each other again it was NOT CHILL. Although we unintentionally spent 4 months on opposite sides of the globe with a 17 hour time difference… I still felt closer than ever to you. The hours on FaceTime everyday and random gift care packages were fun. You completely took over my camera roll because I couldn’t help but to screenshot your face every couple seconds. Getting a little part of you tattooed on my arm also contributed to you feeling closer to me I guess 😝 Thank you for making me happy everyday. Thank you for giving me something to always look forward to. Thank you for making me a better version of myself. I love you Photos by: @jordenkeith

So while we watch the song-and-dance with Barrett, everybody knows the ending. On the issues most important to Republican or Federalist Society donors-- corporate and monopoly power, deregulation of industry, breaking unions and worker power--rest assured that Amy Coney Barrett and her conservative colleagues will deliver every time. While some chunk of The Base might be hoping Barrett will provide the vote to overturn _Roe v. Wade_ , it seems just as likely that abortion rights will continue to die by a thousand cuts from state legislatures, as they have been for years, while conservative justices churn out opinions about how The Framers would have agreed abortion-clinic hallways should be a certain width.
 And if Republicans are successful in turning the 2020 election into a legal fight, the Supreme Conservatives may well deliver on that, too. Republicans were worried that John Roberts might only be in the bag on voting rights, not actually throwing the election their way. They actually said this out loud when they suggested we could not enter the election proper with a "4-4 court" --implying Roberts would side with the remaining liberals--and that they needed to install Barrett to ensure a friendly majority, featuring three justices appointed by the president, to hear cases that could determine whether he remains president. (In today's hearing, Barrett refused to say whether federal law permits the president to delay a presidential election. Is this Textualism?) All this, after John Roberts followed up his time attacking voting rights in Ronald Reagan's Justice Department by rising to the nation's highest court to eviscerate the Voting Rights Act. Ye, of little faith. And that's after the former Chief Justice, William Rehnquist, _also_started off as a Republican operative ratfucking the vote in Arizona. __

The movie begins four years after Zach’s initial diagnosis, and he’s already survived God knows how many rounds of chemotherapy by the time we see him amble into view on a pair of crutches and start cracking jokes about how he’s balder than any of the teachers at his Minnesota high school. “Most teenagers out there feel like they’re invincible,” he confides to us via some voiceover narration, but Zach seems to be empowered by the knowledge that he isn’t; he doesn’t know his cancer is about to come back with a vengeance, but he’s already learned that life is more of a gift than a promise, and he isn’t afraid to live out loud and — say — take the stage at the school talent show and bust out a solid acoustic cover of LMFAO’s “Sexy and I Know It” when his moonfaced BFF gets too nervous to perform the original tune she’s prepared for the occasion (Sammy is played by winsome and multi-talented “Work It” star Sabrina Carpenter, who leans into her character’s mid-‘90s coffeehouse vibe with the confidence of someone convinced that Lilith Fair is about to make a big comeback).

Nella giornata precedente alla tappa tecnica l'inviato dell'Unione europea per il dialogo Belgrado-Pristina, Miroslav Lajcak, ha reso noto attraverso un post pubblicato su Twitter che sarebbero stati discussi i temi relativi ai diritti delle minoranze e alle loro richieste di risarcimento finanziario. Secondo quanto precisato da Lajcak, il tema del confronto è stato concordato dal presidente della Serbia, Aleksandar Vucic, e dal premier kosovaro Avdullah Hoti. "Il presidente Vucic e il primo ministro Hoti hanno convenuto che i loro negoziatori discuteranno delle rivendicazioni finanziarie e degli accordi relativi alle comunità minoritarie. Entrambi gli argomenti sono molto complessi, e per questo motivo domani discuteremo delle richieste finanziarie e nei prossimi giorni degli accordi per le comunità minoritarie", ha scritto Lajcak su Twitter. Il rappresentante speciale dell'Ue per il dialogo Belgrado-Pristina ha recentemente affermato che "è giunto il momento di completare con successo il processo di dialogo" dopo 10 anni. "Oggi sono esattamente 10 anni da quando l'Assemblea generale delle Nazioni Unite ha accolto con favore la disponibilità dell'Unione europea a mediare il processo di dialogo tra Belgrado e Pristina.

 MONTREAL, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Shares in Canadian tour operator Transat A.T. Inc jumped as much as 30% on Tuesday after Air Canada's revised offer raised optimism the deal once shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic could be completed.
 On Saturday, Air Canada cut the deal value to buy Transat by nearly 75% to about C$188.7 million ($143.86 million), down from C$720 million, as COVID-19 weighs on travel demand.
 With the pandemic grounding flights globally, Air Canada had faced shareholder pressure to renegotiate the deal which is still pending approval from European and Canadian regulators.
 On Tuesday afternoon, Transat shares were trading at C$4.74 compared with Air Canada's offer price of C$5.00. Air Canada shares were down 1.8%.
 Analysts said the revised price would give Air Canada greater motivation to conclude the deal, which was believed to be on thin ice.
 "COVID-19 has resulted in significant uncertainty for the airline industry, which made us doubt whether the combination of TRZ and AC would even occur," Desjardins analyst Benoit Poirier said in a note to clients on Tuesday.
 "We believe the revised agreement offers incentives for AC to obtain regulatory approvals for the transaction."
 Letko Brosseau, the largest shareholder in both companies according to Refinitiv data, was not immediately available for comment.
 One portfolio manager who holds Air Canada stock said he believes Transat shareholders will have little option other than to approve it.
 "What are the alternatives," asked the manager who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media. "This is the best that they are going to get in this environment."
 Transat shareholders are set to vote on the deal in early December. (Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal Editing by Chris Reese)
