In terms of end user, infrastructure constitute one of the key market segments. Constructing a building or architectural structure as per contemporary standards has certain specific requirements. It is therefore necessary to develop concrete with specific properties to meet the requirements. This has resulted in the development of self-compacting concrete, which flows under its own weight and thus can easily fill formworks. Furthermore, self-compacting concrete is compacted under the influence of self-weight, without any additional processing. These factors have significantly impacted the use of self-compacting concrete in the infrastructure sector.

All good things come to an end, someday, but so do all bad things. We are stressed because we feel unable to do as we please, go where we wish, check out that new furniture or go to gatherings with our friends and our churches.
 But have you noticed you are fixing up your house and getting the yard ready for summer? It's hard to ignore things when you see them every day. Working from home means you want to fix it up.
 A friend asked me to write something to the people of La Junta as I will no longer be writing for the newspaper. I have enjoyed this job more than any other job in my life, though teaching school was quite a trip. I taught special education with the able assistance of my friend, Lucy Archuleta. One day we had to shred all the files of the children who no longer needed special services as they went on to middle school. "Lucy, we are sitting here shredding our success stories," I said. It is true. One of them is sitting on the city council now.
 Ernie Orahood, a principal and a man of great character, once said to me, "When God shuts a door, he opens a window." I believe that is true, and words to live by.
 The La Junta Tribune-Democrat has been in business since the 19th century. Al Burtis bought the first offset press in the area and printed the neighboring newspapers. It was a sad day for old-timers when the press shut down. Times change but you miss the press guys. You don't miss the breakdowns due to parts wearing out and realizing the only reason they could be replaced was that a small newspaper in New York State was closing down its press.
 Here's hoping the tradition can be continued. We live in a different atmosphere today, but we still need news that has been vetted. That's a new word, but it has the same meaning as the New York Times slogan, "all the news that's fit to print." You don't print things that don't come from a reliable source.

USA Football is launching an app that can help coaches and parents on all youth levels of the sport.
   
 At a key time, too, with so many youngsters across the nation unable to gather for any games or practices -- now or for who knows how long?
   
 The free app, called Coach Planner by USA Football, was built by the governing body of the sport as part of the Football Development Model that aligns with the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee's American Development Model. The FDM is designed to aid in the progression of the whole athlete based on a child's age and stage of development.
   
 Coaches, who are often parents of the players, teach athletes based on their age, skill level and the version of the sport that they prefer, from flag football to 11-player tackle and game types in between. More than 100 football drills and 12 prescribed practice plans are loaded on the app, with more to come.
   
 "If we plan something, it has to be scaleable and global," said Michael Krueger, USA Football's senior director of football education. "With technical skill progressions, it helps provide context for the developmental stage of the athlete and for their coaching. A 7-year old is at a way different stage than a 12-year old. The neatest thing about the app is it helps provide that kind of resource and support in the space where we may not have coaches with extensive background. Their knowledge could be extensive or limited. The resources here run the gamut."
   
 For example, if coaches have been involved in the sport for a decade or more, reinforcement of their techniques is available on the app. But if the coaches are newcomers or relatively inexperienced, there are programs available for them as well.
   
 "It does speak to the differences in coaches," Krueger says, "their approaches and backgrounds, and it's built on the expertise within the sport."
   
 The app took a bit over a year to develop; Football Canada already had one for its youth organizations and provided some guidance to its neighbors in the states. USA Football has nearly 900 youth clubs and leagues already enrolled in the development model, and the app can provide the coaching services currently not available because of the shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 It includes six categories for player development: athletic foundations; passing; running and receiving; kicking and punting; preparation for contact; flag pulling and tackling.
   
 "We have to take the reality of the situation, and the app is a great example of touch points," Krueger explained. "How can we be a resource with kids at home? We have taken on that challenge."
   
 Critical to the success of the FDM are such touch points as ensuring that playbooks and drills are easily usable, and for coaches to connect with their teams and players' parents. to connect. Through the app, they can share all the content needed to teach the sport.
   
 "We want to make sure this really addresses the things parents could do with their kids at home while in shelter," added Jamie Riley, USA Football's chief of staff. "When this rolls out, they can take it and run with it at home.
   
 "As a mom, I can attest to the importance of making sure parents understand and are involved in what their child learns on the field and the Coach Planner app helps them get there. We know nothing is as effective as in-person and face-to-face (learning), yet the app is a great bridge to that."

Ideally, at least for Little League, the season could commence in early-June and a regular-season of 10 to 12 games could be played through July. The regular season would last four to five weeks. Little League district and state tournaments are also a possibility, yet let’s not put the cart before the horse.
 On paper most teams have been put together or drafted, thus it’s a matter of getting in a few practices before hearing the much-awaited words, ‘play ball.’
 Summer travel leagues for baseball, softball, volleyball, soccer, basketball, etc., are also in the same loop in that each would like to get the summer season going, yet each has to wait because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Local officials are keeping their fingers crossed, but they also know the 2020 summer season might not happen at all.
 Stay tuned.

Numerous stories of Kansans going to New York to help fight COVID-19 have been told in recent weeks. Reports of cards, letters and supplies from Kansas lifting the spirits and equipping medical workers in the city are plentiful.
   
 But before anyone ever heard of the coronavirus, a Topeka native was in New York, serving the city's most badly injured and in need of emergency care.
   
 Katherine McKenzie has served as a trauma and critical care surgeon in New York since 2015, and when the city took the brunt of the invasion of COVID-19, she was on the frontline.
   
 McKenzie is a graduate of Topeka High School in 2000, as well as of Kansas State University and Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences. She now serves as trauma medical director at New York's Jamaica Hospital, so she's no stranger to crisis. But she and the hospital couldn't predict what this new virus would bring.
   
 "I was aware that this was going on outside of the United States, but didn't really have an idea how bad things might be here so quickly," said McKenzie, who became aware in late February that the hospital was making preparations for the virus, including stocking up on supplies such as ventilators.
   
 In March, the hospital redistributed all its resources, including the staff. Because the patients McKenzie treats are typically victims of accidents and violence, she wasn't able to just cease her normal responsibilities. She just added more.
   
 "We have really extended ourselves while maintaining our normal role," McKenzie said. "The hospital freed up space and resources by canceling any nonessential care. That also freed up people to redistribute to those areas. But we have to still maintain trauma services, because if we don't, there's nowhere else for those patients to go."
   
 McKenzie said Jamaica Hospital, which serves a population of 1.2 million people in Queens and eastern Brooklyn, has the second busiest trauma center in the city, the busiest in Queens.
   
 "We have a huge reach that we take care of. If we weren't (available) it would be a danger to the community. So discontinuing those services was not an option."
   
 So McKenzie and the trauma staff rolled up their sleeves and took on the virus in addition to their normal load. During the peak of the crisis, the hospital saw between 200 and 300 people a day -- double the normal amount. McKenzie said she has been working about 80 hours a week recently.
   
 "We recognized that we would have to extend ourselves," McKenzie said. "So we took over the care of a 13-bed COVID unit. We rotate covering that, while rotating coverage of the surgery unit. Everyone recognizes the need and everyone wants to pitch in and help."
   
 Even for a veteran trauma surgeon, the crisis has been emotionally and psychologically draining.
   
 "Taking care of the critically ill patients is very hard," McKenzie said. "They are very sick, and few of them get better. That's a challenge for everyone involved with taking care of them. You hear a lot of sad stories. We talk to their families every day on the phone. It's difficult to have those conversations.
   
 "We're used to more of our patients getting better. We're used to having more successes than failures. When patients get to the point that they're requiring intensive care, their risk of mortality is extremely high, and that's something that we're not used to seeing."
   
 Unlike some health care providers in New York, McKenzie goes home after each shift to her husband and 2-year-old son, Nolan. To prepare to be with them, she showers at the hospital, then showers again upon arriving at home, careful to put all her clothes straight into the laundry.
   
 McKenzie developed an interest in medicine when her mother, Topekan Susan McKenzie, underwent two heart surgeries.
   
 "That was an inspirational moment for me," McKenzie said. "She had her last surgery when I was 18 years old, and it was a pivotal moment for me as far as directing me to the career I wanted to go into.
   
 "Growing up in Topeka, I always felt supported and like my interests were fostered, both within my family and in the educational system. I always had teachers who were supportive and interested in helping you find outlets for the things you were fascinated with. I felt like I had a great foundation for the steps that came afterwards."
   
 Seeing some COVID-19 precautionary restrictions lifted, Kansans are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. McKenzie said New Yorkers aren't quite there yet. But things at the hospital aren't as dire as they were in recent weeks.
   
 "It feels like the strain is a lot less," McKenzie said. "Our admissions are down. Just this week, we feel like we're starting to contract from that surge, so that makes everything feel a lot less stressful.
   
 "As far as the community goes, people are still very cautious. My son hasn't been out the front door since March 10. We just don't feel comfortable taking him anywhere, and I don't know when I will feel comfortable doing that.
   
 "So for New Yorkers to feel like they're ready to go out and live life normally, I don't think we're quite there yet. But it does feel like the worst has past. It's still bad, but it feels like it's getting better."
   
 Despite her busy schedule, McKenzie said she visits Topeka several times a year. She appreciates the change of pace and still considers it "home." She said she has been encouraged by messages of support from Kansans during the recent crisis.
   
 "I've been really surprised how many people have reached out to me over the last few weeks, offering their kind words and support. People from childhood who I haven't spoken to in a long time are reaching out to say they are seeing what's in the news and they are thinking about me. That's really powerful."

The silicone gel market will grow to a great extent on account of new applications. Some of these applications are chemistry, LED lighting, cosmetics and personal care, photovoltaic sectors, automotive electronics, aerospace and defense, comfort pads, agriculture, pharmaceutical industries, footwear and medical industries. The rapidly expanding electrical & electronics industry will boost the demand for silicone gel. Silicone gel has some primary properties such as high dielectric breakdown, hydrophobicity, and resistance for humidity, water, and high and low temperatures. It is also easy to use. As these properties are of great benefit to the electrical & electronics industry, it has been demanding silicone gel increasingly. Therefore, the market for silicone gel will rise at a considerable pace.

Already a standout as a freshman, Leonard had grown by leaps and bounds as a player over the last two years with the U.S. Development Academy.
 “We were going to be getting a phenomenal player,” Heugh said of Leonard. “She was already great, but was a much-improved version of herself based on playing the competition she has the last two years. She would have been a big goal- scorer. She’s a great passer with good vision, and she has the ability to score goals with both feet at a high rate.”
 Heugh always remained close with Leonard between 2017 and 2020, as the family has been a big part of the Athens program and Heugh knew Allison wanted to be wearing red and white in the spring.
 “If she was given the opportunity to not have to make a choice, I know Athens soccer was deep in her heart,” he said. “I know she had to make a decision that was best for her future, and I understand that. I know she really wanted to play with her teammates at Athens and I know she was looking forward to this senior year for some time, so she could return to playing for this team.”
 The two years with the development academy led to Leonard getting a chance to play for Butler next season. Ashley Leonard is currently playing at Western Kentucky.
 “Looking back, I can’t say I would change anything, because it helped me grow as a person and player with those experiences,” Allison said of playing with the academy. “But, I do really wish that I would have been able to play one more year of high school soccer.”
 Leonard would have been one of nine seniors on the Athens roster this year. She would have joined Shayna Landess, Emma Wodwaski, Madison Maziasz, Veronica Ballios and Rachel White. Captaining the team would have been seniors Izzy Crum, Jess McEachern and Samantha Slimak.
 Heugh led the Troy Athens boys to a Division 1 state championship in the fall and had high hopes to make a run this spring with the girls.
 “We really experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows this year,” Heugh said. “To go from winning it all with the boys in the fall to not having a season with the girls really was such a range of emotions. The boys and girls programs are really close and the girls were always there to support the boys, and I know the boys were excited to do the same for them this spring. The girls were just really hoping for their shot.”
 While disappointment still remains for Leonard, she has taken a new view on things in recent weeks and is trying to spread a positive message.
 “The first week was rough and I just kept wondering how this could be happening, but my mindset has completely changed,” Leonard said. “This experience is teaching us a valuable lesson that we need to put people’s needs and safety in front our ourselves and what we want. Even if we have to make sacrifices, it’s all about the greater good.”

 How much you enjoy "Frank Miller's Sin City," an ultraviolent fanboy freak show, may depend on how many piercings you have.
   
 The film, an adaptation of Miller's 1991 cult comics, is stylish and visually daring. Miller is, after all, the artist who revived Batman with his epochal "Dark Knight" series.
   
 But this "Sin City" movie is also a half-hour too long, brutal, crude and relentlessly juvenile, a work designed to appeal to the antisocial 13-year-old inside all of us.
   
 Co-directed by Robert Rodriquez of "Spy Kids" fame and Miller and "guest directed," whatever that means, by Quentin Tarantino, the film recalls Stanley Kubrick's 1971 classic "A Clockwork Orange" in terms of transgressive content and Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" (1990) in its outre visual stylings.
   
 The three-part action takes place in a noirish, black-and-white universe. But it's black-and-white with shockingly lush splashes of color, a style Rodriguez ("Once Upon a Time in Mexico," "From Dusk 'til Dawn") derives from his source.
   
 In opening scenes reminiscent of a Calvin Klein ad, Josh Hartnett appears as a handsome hitman. The dialogue is self-consciously hard-boiled, and everything is black and white, except a beautiful babe's iconic red dress and blood-red lips.
   
 Like Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" and "Kill Bill," films Rodriguez obviously admires, "Sin City" veers back and forth between different, overlapping story lines, all set in Miller's crime-ridden, film-noir hellhole Basin City.
   
 In the first, Bruce Willis is John Hartigan, a cop with a "bum ticker" and a jagged, cross-shaped scar on his forehead. John risks his life to save an 11-year-old damsel from a rapist/killer (Nick Stahl) who is the son of a U.S. senator.
   
 Willis, whose boxer persona is the linchpin of "Pulp Fiction," does not serve a similar steadying role here in large part because the character is so implausible. Hartigan is supposed to be "pushing 60" when he stops the serial killer, castrating him with a shot from his cannon-sized revolver.
   
 When the action resumes eight years later, Hartigan must be pushing 70, and yet the now 19-year-old girl, now a stripper (affectless Jessica Alba), longs to go to bed with him. At the same time, the hideously deformed killer known as Yellow Bastard has regrown his naughty bits and is still after her.
   
 The second section features Mickey Rourke with a prosthetic nose and chin in which he resembles the unforgettable actor Rondo Hatton of "The Creeper" film series of the 1940s.
   
 Rourke is Marv, a brutish street fighter with the ability to dish out and take tremendous punishment and leap off tall buildings. When Marv's latest bedmate Goldie (Jaime King) is killed, he goes on a rampage to avenge her. The rampage involves beatings, shootings, a hospital stay and a visit to his naked parole officer (Carla Gugino, the mother in "Spy Kids").
   
 In a thin, third tale, which includes a sequence directed by Tarantino, Clive Owen is Dwight, a surly yet suave private investigator trying to protect Old Town's S & M-costumed hookers, including statuesque ex-girlfriend Gail (eye- poppingly Amazonian Rosario Dawson), after they mistakenly kill a cop (Benicio del Toro). This segment also features Miho (Devon Aoki), a "Kill Bill"-like warrior woman armed with a samurai sword.
   
 In addition to ugly costumes and hairstyles, Rodriguez, who served as cinematographer and visual effects supervisor, has assembled an all-star team of heavyweight screen bruisers: Willis, Rourke, del Toro, Powers Boothe, Michael Madsen and Rutger Hauer as the loathesome prelate Cardinal Roark.
   
 However weak their material, these guys leave big footprints on the screen. Rodriguez also wittily casts the world's favorite hobbit (Elijah Wood) as a murderous cannibal who eats one victim's surgically removed hand in front of her and mounts his other female victims' heads on his wall (only one of the film's flagrantly misogynistic "touches"). Many of the automobiles in this noir universe are vintage Ferraris - works of art on wheels. In the film's most memorably lyrical scene, Marv drives his car off a pier and claws his way to the surface as the automobile, its lights still on, sinks into the abyss.
   
 Tarantino and Rodriguez may be on the same wavelength. But Tarantino is much smarter. He understands how Pam Grier movies trade in both T & A and feminist allegory. Rodriguez can't see past the T & A, and his actors here give wildly divergent performances. In the Gloria Graham-like, tough-cookie waitress role Brittany Murphy is just grating, and a turn by Michael Clarke Duncan ("The Green Mile") is entirely superfluous.
   
 "Sin City" made me ask if my life would have been complete without seeing Bruce Willis rip a guy's genitals off (yes).
   
 There's nothing wrong with pandering to that feral child crouching inside us all. Much of pop culture does. But after a while, that little creep really gets on my nerves.

Game 5 is remembered as the Charles Smith game — the Bulls were up by one but the Knicks had a chance to score and take the lead. The ball ended up in the hands of 6'10" Charles Smith, a guy not known as a scorer but who averaged 10 points a game that season and he was right at the rim, but so were Jordan, Pippen, and Grant.

Leonard could have never anticipated that that season would never begin.
 “It’s crazy how you can be looking forward to something for so long and then just have it taken away in a blink of the eye,” Leonard said.
 Due to the concerns over the COVID-19 outbreak, the MHSAA canceled the entire spring 2020 season for prep athletes, leaving Leonard unable to carry out a plan that had been years in the making.
 As a freshman, Leonard excelled on the Athens soccer team, playing midfield and center back for the Red Hawks. What made the experience special was she got to play alongside her older sister, Ashley, who was a senior at the time.
 “We looked forward to that opportunity because we would be playing alongside each other a lot. It was just such a cool and unique experience to be able to play together for our community,” Leonard said of playing with Ashley. “It was a whole new level of fun for me.”
 Allison was named third team All-State as a freshman, as she scored 15 goals and tallied 15 assists.
 “She was an outstanding player as a freshman,” Athens coach Todd Heugh said. “She actually led our team in overall points. It was like having an ultimate playmaker on your team. She was like a quarterback on the soccer field. She touched the ball nearly every possession and always made the right plays.”
 Leonard knew she would be making the transition to playing for the U.S. Development Academy the next two springs, as she was looking to pursue a Division 1 college scholarship. Still, Allison always had 2020 on her mind.
 Driving that motivation to return to Athens would be a chance for her to play with another sister. This time it would be Amanda, who was going to be joining the team as a freshman this spring.
 “I always knew I would be coming back my senior year because I wanted to play with my little sister, who would be a freshman at the time,” Leonard said. “I thought that would be another truly unique situation to be in. That freshman season was one of the happiest semesters I had, so I knew I had to get back to playing for Athens. My sister led by example and was a great role model for me when I was a freshman. I wanted to make that transition and do the same for (Amanda) this year. Leading by example is very important to me. While it’s great to lead with words, you really have to show people that you can be a true leader.”
 Athens was set to have a strong 2020 roster, as the Red Hawks returned most of their scoring from a 2019 team that spent the majority of the season ranked.
 “I was feeling pretty good about this team,” Heugh said. “We lost to a good Troy team in last year’s districts, but were a top-5 team heading into the postseason. We were returning almost all of our scoring, while adding Allison into that. There was definitely a lot of excitement within the team about what we thought we could accomplish.”

Millions of people who depend on tourism are laid off or furloughed. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 8 million tourism-related workers are jobless right now, or about one-third of total U.S. unemployment, said Roger Dow, the president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
 Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, the leading airline trade group, said carriers need to fill at least 70% of seats to break even on most flights. If they're required to block or remove many seats, they will either stop flying or raise prices 50%, he said.
 That will delay recovery for places like Israel, which sees almost all of its tourists arrive by air. Diklah Cohen Sheinfeld, chief of staff of the Israeli Tourism Ministry’s director general’s office, said the tourism industry — which employs 250,000 Israelis — was the first to be impacted and will likely be the last to recover.
 “There are no tourists and no entry to the country for tourists. The gates are totally closed,” she said.
