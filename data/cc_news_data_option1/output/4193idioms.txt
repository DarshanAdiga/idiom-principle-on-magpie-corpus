For example, a devastating humanitarian situation arises in Yemen and so the government decides that it is going to give some aid to Yemen. But at the same time, the government sells arms to Saudi Arabia knowing full well that Saudi Arabia will use those arms to go and kill people in Yemen. If Saudi Arabia was planning to use those arms to go and kill people in Germany, I think that equation would be different. But the life of a Yemeni is not as valuable, and the money that comes in through the arms sales is much more than that being spent on the aid going to Yemen. At the end of the day, the bottom line is self-interest and a kind of 'any cost' reasoning that says 'as long as this doesn't affect those who have the power'.

To round off our weekend, we walk through the village and the ancient wood above it – at the recommendation of one of the super-friendly reception team – inspect the hotel's eye-catching 18-hole golf course and have lunch at the hotel's 12th-century gastropub in the village, The Castle Inn.
 Again, it could be a tad more antique-y inside, but we very much enjoy our squash soup with chorizo; Sunday roast; fish and chips, and syrup steamed pudding with custard.
 But the biggest hit is the rosemary baked potato focaccia with mouthwatering homemade smoked sea salt butter.
 I'd eat scoops of it.

 We amble back to the hotel via the main entrance, which takes you past a riverside sign indicating the 'perfect photo opportunity' for a picture of the property, along with Twitter and Instagram handles for the hotel and the group that runs it – Exclusive Collection.
 The sign is spot on – it's a great angle (with the flagpole hidden behind a lovely big tree). Given the pretty setting, though, it feels a bit tacky. However, such corporate whiffs are not strong enough to break the spell this bewitching hotel has cast over us.

Crypto.com downtrend continues, but the 200 SMA support could lead to a reversal. THETA's downside is protected by both the ascending trendline and the 50 SMA. AAVE settles above the $40 critical support following migration from LEND. As the week grinds to a halt, we take a look at the gainers and the losers. As discussed on Saturday, Waves, ABBC Coin and Filecoin emerged best-performers. On the other hand, Cryoto.com, THETA and AAVE received a heavy battering from the bears, recording the biggest losses among the top 50. The news highlight of the week is the suspension of digital assets/cryptocurrencies withdrawals by OKEx, a leading exchange in the market. The incident destabilized the market, raising questions over centralized exchanges' reliability and whether decentralized exchanges are the way to go. The suspended services remain unavailable, but "other functions are up and running." Crypt.com downtrend nears its elastic limit Crypto.com sliced through the descending triangle support as predicted earlier. Besides, a tentative anchorage at $0.14 did little to cushion the crypto asset from the breakdown. At the moment, CRO is dancing at $0.127 even as the bearish grip intensifies. A glance farther down reveals a last resort buyer congestion zone at the 200 Simple Moving Average in the daily timeframe. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stresses the bearish outlook by diving sharply into the oversold territory. Therefore, the anticipated support must hold; otherwise, losses might become unstoppable. On the bright side, an oversold condition is a bullish sign and coupled with the support mentioned earlier, may lead to a reversal. CRO/USD daily chart IntoTheBlock's IOMAP model illustrates the absence of resistance to the region between $0.136 and $0.14. Here, 275 addresses previously bought nearly 3.5 billion CRO. Therefore, if the price reverses from the ongoing downtrend, room for growth exists until CRO hits this resistance range. On the flip side, the model reveals the lack of strong support for the token. In other words, the breakdown could continue, mostly if minor support at $0.125 and $0.121 is shattered. Here, 360 addresses previously purchased 8.81 million CRO. Crypto.com IOMAP chart THETA recovery in the offing After losing 15% in the last seven days, THETA seems poised for a reversal. It is trading at $0.63 while the 50-day SMA protects its immediate downside. THETA has not traded below this moving average since May. Therefore, a correction might come into the picture. Besides, a long-term ascending trendline is reinforcing the support. Similarly, the RSI points upwards after hitting levels slightly below the midline, suggesting that the bulls' turn is nigh. THETA/USD daily chart When looking at THETA's network growth, a bearish thesis is brought into the picture. Over the last few days, the number of new THETA addresses joining the network has declined sharply. The number of addresses joining THETA was eight on October 13 but had plummeted to 3 by October 17, representing a 62% drop. The downtrend in network growth is a red flag for the price of THETA in the near term. The regular inflow and outflow of tokens in the network tend to reduce with a downward trend in network growth, affecting liquidity. THETA new addresses chart AAVE settles for consolation LEND recently completed the migration to AAVE following a successful "voting period for the first Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP1)." The move was so that the community governs the new token through systematic voting processes. Consequently, staking has been added to ensure that users earn on their holdings. Moreover, the team says, "the purpose of staking is to act as a mitigation tool in case of a shortfall event." AAVE 1-hour chart Following the migration, AAVE shot up to $57. However, a retreat occurred immediately, sending the token on a spiral to $38. A reflex correction also took place, but recovery hit a barrier at $44. Meanwhile, $40 has been established as the initial critical support. The resistance at the 50 SMA in the hourly range must come down for gains to materialize towards the $44 resistance. AAVE holder distribution chart According to Santiment's holder distribution metric, uptake of AAVE through migration is still in progress. A significant rise in the number of addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 AAVE has been recorded. For instance, whales in this range soared from only five on October 15 to 40 on October 18, representing an 87.5% increase. If buying pressure continues to mount behind AAVE in the coming days, recovery will most likely occur.

Alice Irvine Godfrey passed away quietly at her San Marino, California, home on the afternoon of Saturday, October 3, 2020, bringing to a close a well and fully lived life marked by professional accomplishment, a strong and abiding faith and, most importantly to her, a deep and loving commitment to her family. Alice was born on March 22, 1928, in San Francisco, California, the daughter of William Lepla Irvine and Sarah Sydonia McKinlay Irvine. Her early years were spent living in the Noe Valley area of San Francisco. She attended high school at Dominican Convent High School and went on to earn her bachelor's degree from Dominican College, both in San Rafael, California. It was at a Halloween party while at Dominican College where she met the love of her life, William Clark Godfrey, to whom she was married for 58 wonderful years until his passing in 2011. Bill's career in the oil industry took them initially to the oil fields of Taft, California, and then to Los Angeles, where they welcomed their first of seven children. They moved to San Francisco, living in the Park Merced neighborhood, and added three more to their growing family. Finally, they settled permanently in San Marino where they completed and raised their family and became active members of the parish community of Sts. Felicitas &amp; Perpetua Catholic Church. Alice led an active life as mother, educator, philanthropist, volunteer and friend. After relocating to San Marino, she earned her master's degree in education at California State University Los Angeles, which she employed with great love and skill until her retirement from her role as Director of Gifted and Talented Education for the San Marino School District. Her background in education proved helpful during her years as a member of the Board of Trustees of the San Domenico School for Girls in San Anselmo. She was also an active member of the Social Service League of Catholic Charities and the Christ Child Society. For several years she led a highly popular Bible study program at Sts. Felicitas &amp; Perpetua. Until her passing, she was a devoted friend, colleague and benefactor to the Carmelite Sisters of the Most Sacred Heart of Los Angeles. Alice had a wide circle of friends and, once her children had grown and were busy with their own families, there was little she enjoyed more than meeting one or more of those many friends for lunch at a local restaurant. Alice and Bill's home was always very lively and one of those where all the kids liked to gather. It was full of children and teens, whether their own or the friends of their children. Ever present and welcoming, Alice became affectionately known to all as "Big Al." And when "Mrs. Godfrey" was greeted by one of her many former students while out and about in the community, she was thrilled to respond with a warm smile and hug. And even when she did not quite remember each of their names, she was always ready with "Blessed" as a welcome substitute. Alice is survived by six of her and Bill's children, Peter (Sharyn), Stephen (Kathy), MaryAlice (David Dick), Sally Godfrey, Joan Grubert (Duane) and Emily Bowring (Doug). She was predeceased by their son Joseph. She took particular delight and pride in her grandchildren, Zach and Samantha Godfrey, Elizabeth Warner, Jessica and Nick Godfrey, Alex, Madeleine, Rosalind and MaryCharlotte Dick-Godfrey, William, MarySarah and Richel Shea, Emily and Olivia Grubert, and Boyd, Peter, Amanda, Clark &amp; Webber Bowring. She celebrated her great-grandchildren, Jack, Rylan and Finley Warner, and two more, by Samantha and Madeleine, expected within days of each other in February. She was predeceased by her great-granddaughter Taylor Grace Warner. Whether Mom, Grandma or Big Al, Alice will be missed by many. But when she was called from and departed this world, she left behind a lasting legacy and passed confident in the promises fulfilled in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Services were private and arranged by Cabot &amp; Sons, Pasadena. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to The Carmelite Sisters of the Most Sacred Heart of Los Angeles, 920 East Alhambra Road, Alhambra, California 91801-2799.

In Loving Memory HANLAN, Jody Lynn Jody Lynn Hanlan, age 55, passed away the morning of Saturday, October 10th, 2020, surrounded by loving family. Jody was born to James and Janet (Metlow) Matzdorf in Chewelah, WA on January 5th, 1965. A longtime Valley resi-dent, Jody was raised in Valley, running on the Chewelah High School track team, and graduating from Chewelah in the spring of 1983. That same year, she married her high school sweetheart, Troy Kinder, and they enjoyed three years together before parting ways. In 1986 Jody married Pat Hanlan, and together they welcomed three children, beginning in 1987 with Patrick, followed by James and Lacey. Jody's kids were her everything, and she found joy during this time raising them and encouraging everything they did. After the end of her marriage to Pat, Jody reentered the work force, working in the library at the Springdale School from 2001 until 2006. After a visit from her sister Janell in Alaska, Jody and her children decided to board Janell's converted bus and return with them to the great wilderness of Alaska. Jody spent four years working as a security guard for a large gold mining operation, and in her free time she enjoyed spending time at the Buffalo Bar, which she later managed. Returning to the Valley community that she called home for the majority of her life, Jody retired due to some health concerns in (2010?), and she began to enjoy the extra family time retirement allowed. Family was everything to Jody, and she was overjoyed when her grandsons were born and she was able to become a doting grandmother. Jody will be remembered as a woman with lots of love and a heart of gold, who would frequently go out of her way to make sure that everyone around her and her family was well taken care of and loved. Jody was preceded in death by her mother, Janet Louise Matzdorf. She is survived by her father, James Matzdorf, of Valley; sons Patrick (Sandra) Hanlan and James (Katherine) Hanlan; daughter Lacey Hanlan of Spokane, WA; sisters Janell (Kerry) Erickson of Delta Junction, AK, Jill (Doug) Ryan of St. Maries, ID, and Jamie (Steve) Lovato of Valley; grandsons Maverick Underhill and Lowen Hanlan; and numerous nieces and nephews, as well as all the Lost Boys that she always welcomed into her home.

"There's a piece of me that just wants to give up a little bit. I just hate to have to keep disappointing the kids," she said. "But I also feel like this is an important life lesson: Sometimes people want to silence you, and sometimes people don't agree with you. But if you think what you're doing is important, then you should keep doing it."
 Matthew Young took his Lab School kindergartener to the memorial Saturday morning and saw three mothers of middle school students in the Black Students' Association repairing the damage.
 "My son brought us over there today to show us a poster that his class had put up, and when we got there, we saw that it had been torn down," he said. "My son went to go show us where the poster was, but it wasn't there anymore.
 "He just said that he was sad that it was gone, it was a poster his whole class had contributed to," Young continued. "He showed us where it had been, and he just talked about how his class would like to put it back. And, you know, I think for a five-year-old, he kind of understands a little bit about why somebody might vandalize this and understands that they would want to recreate it.
 "I think it's disappointing, and I would hope that the university would do something about not allowing this to continue. … I just hope when the kids recreate this, it can stay up this time."

LIPPINCOTT, Janette Ann (Rosher) On October 5, 2020, Janette Ann (Rosher) Lippincott passed away in Spokane, WA. She was born in Eatonia, Saskatchewan, Canada, the youngest of five children of Frederick and Amy Nora Rosher. Gradu- ating from Eaton High School and Calgary Business College, Janette worked as a secretary during her working life. She's worked for numerous different organizations over the years, in business and charities. When she met her husband Harry, she was working as a secretary in a mining operation in Lynn Lake, Manitoba. Harry was working for the U.S. government in field survey and was sent to Lynn Lake as part of a working group with the Canadians. Over the years, Janette volunteered through her church, sang in the choir, and volunteered with her daughter's ballet activities mostly sewing many costumes for various performances. She and Harry also appeared on stage in the local annual production of the Nutcracker while living in Maryland. Locally, Janette volunteered on the front desk at the Southside Senior Activity Center and in the office at Hamblen Park Presbyterian Church. When Harry retired, they relocated from Maryland to Spokane, as this was much closer to Canada, for her to visit her family.

She is survived by her husband Harry of Spokane, her daughter Nora (Andrew) Green of Pomas, Aude, France, her sisters Margaret Chalifour and Marie (Irvin) Perkins, and her sister-in-law Mary Ann Rosher of Saskatchewan, as well as many nieces and nephews in Western Canada.

More than a dozen whales have died in New Zealand after becoming stranded on the country's North Island, the Department of Conservation said on Sunday.
 Rescuers and volunteers worked all day on Saturday to refloat about 25 of the animals, part of a pod of about 40 to 50 pilot whales who got stranded earlier that day on a beach in the Coromandel Peninsula.
 Five dead pilot whales were discovered late on Saturday night at a site thought to be the original stranding location, the department said.
 “Although the high tide at about 9 p.m. on Saturday night had allowed the stranded whales to be refloated, members of the pod restranded this morning including several on rocky outcrops at the bay,” the Department said in a statement on its Facebook account.
 “Sadly, about dozen have died after restranding on the rocks this morning. However, we are encouraged by the fact the majority of the stranded whales have re-joined the pod this morning and have been chaperoned out to deep water.”

After increasing prices of Creta and Verna, Hyundai has now increased prices of Venue crossover Hyundai Motors India launched the Venue sub compact UV back in May 2019. It came in at an introductory price of Rs.6.50 lakh and within a month of launch received bookings to the tune of 33,000 units. That was then. Fast forward to Oct 2020, and Venue is now one of the best selling cars in the segment - registering 8k+ sales every month. This too, despite increase in competition. Since launch of Venue, two more cars have been launched in the segment. These are Kia Sonet and Toyota Urban Cruiser. But this has not had any impact on sales of Venue. In fact, sales of Maruti Brezza have gone down. At the time of Venue launch, it was Brezza which was the No 1 selling car in segment. But that is no longer the case in Sep 2020. Price hike With increase in production costs due to rising cost of raw materials, transportation, etc - Hyundai has been increasing prices of their cars recently. Earlier this month, we saw Creta and Verna prices getting increased. And now, prices of Venue have been increased. As you can see in the above table, prices of Hyundai Venue petrol variants has increased by 7k on almost all variants. Except for base E variant, SX iMT and SX Plus DCT. Price of E variant has been increased by 5k, while that of SX iMT is unchanged and that of SX Plus DCT has been increased by 12k. Below are the diesel Venue prices for Oct 2020. Diesel Venue prices for Oct 2020 has been increased by 7k for E, S, SX Sport and SX (O). SX Diesel Venue price remains unchanged while SX (O) diesel price has been increased by Rs 6k. All prices above are ex-sh. In spite of the increase in prices, Venue prices are still comparatively lower than arch rival Kia Sonet in most of the variants. For now, it is the Sonet which is leading the sales charts, as it has been just launched. Over the next few months we will get a clearer idea as to which of the two South Korean branded cars is more liked in India. Engine Specs Hyundai Venue is powered by 3 engine options. The 1.0 liter Kappa Turbo GDI petrol engine offers 120 PS power and 172 Nm torque mated to a 6 speed manual transmission or 6 speed iMT or 7 speed DCT. The 1.2 liter Kappa Dual VTVT petrol engine is capable of 83 PS power and 115 Nm torque mated to a 5 speed manual. There is also a 1.5 liter diesel engine offering 100 PS power and 240 Nm torque mated to a 6 speed manual gearbox. Kia Sonet gets same engine options. Though it does not get 6MT with petrol turbo while Venue diesel does not get AT option.

However, something kept troubling me: One of the most difficult decisions parents can make when faced with a child, even an adult child, who is hooked on drugs and is making absolutely terrible life choices and who has become corrupt, is to "pull the plug", withdraw all support ("tough love"), wait for the child's life to crash and hit bottom and then wait until that child is finally willing to set himself straight and enter recovery, Then the parents can extend their support and love to help that recovery. Clearly Joe and Jill had not yet made that painful decision - Joe's getting a prosecutor fired to protect his son was certainly an extreme measure of support - and they continued to be "enablers" of Hunter's destructive behavior. As I said, "pulling the plug" is a really difficult choice to make, a very good reason to be sympathetic toward the parents' plight.

CAIRO (AP) — Egyptian authorities released a comedian, who was working for a popular satirical television program, after more than two years in prison without trial, a rights lawyer said Sunday. Attorney Mokhtar Mounir said Shady Abu Zaid was released from a Cairo police station late Saturday, but as part of his terms of release must report to a police station twice a week. His sister, Roula Abu Zaid, confirmed the news in a Facebook post and shared a photo of the siblings and their friends at home after his release. Police arrested Abu Zaid in May 2018 after plain-clothed security officers raided his house in Cairo. He was charged with joining an outlawed group, a reference to the banned Muslim Brotherhood, and disseminating false news. Earlier this month, a court ordered his conditional release after he exceeded the allowed two-year period for pretrial detention. Abu Zaid was working on camera for a satirical program whose host was a puppet named Abla Fahita. The show has since been canceled. Before his arrest, he also produced a show called “The Rich Content” that popular on social media networks. In 2016, he attracted controversy for handing out balloons made of inflated condoms to police officers on the fifth anniversary of the 2011 uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak and had been aimed at reforming the state's heavy-handed security apparatus. Abu Zaid was one of many government critics behind bars in Egypt amid a years-long crackdown by the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi on the media. More than 60 journalists are in jail in Egypt, according to the International Press Institute, with the country ranked among the world’s worst jailers of journalists.

Alice Irvine Godfrey passed away quietly at her San Marino, California, home on the afternoon of Saturday, October 3, 2020, bringing to a close a well and fully lived life marked by professional accomplishment, a strong and abiding faith and, most importantly to her, a deep and loving commitment to her family. Alice was born on March 22, 1928, in San Francisco, California, the daughter of William Lepla Irvine and Sarah Sydonia McKinlay Irvine. Her early years were spent living in the Noe Valley area of San Francisco. She attended high school at Dominican Convent High School and went on to earn her bachelor's degree from Dominican College, both in San Rafael, California. It was at a Halloween party while at Dominican College where she met the love of her life, William Clark Godfrey, to whom she was married for 58 wonderful years until his passing in 2011. Bill's career in the oil industry took them initially to the oil fields of Taft, California, and then to Los Angeles, where they welcomed their first of seven children. They moved to San Francisco, living in the Park Merced neighborhood, and added three more to their growing family. Finally, they settled permanently in San Marino where they completed and raised their family and became active members of the parish community of Sts. Felicitas & Perpetua Catholic Church. Alice led an active life as mother, educator, philanthropist, volunteer and friend. After relocating to San Marino, she earned her master's degree in education at California State University Los Angeles, which she employed with great love and skill until her retirement from her role as Director of Gifted and Talented Education for the San Marino School District. Her background in education proved helpful during her years as a member of the Board of Trustees of the San Domenico School for Girls in San Anselmo. She was also an active member of the Social Service League of Catholic Charities and the Christ Child Society. For several years she led a highly popular Bible study program at Sts. Felicitas & Perpetua. Until her passing, she was a devoted friend, colleague and benefactor to the Carmelite Sisters of the Most Sacred Heart of Los Angeles. Alice had a wide circle of friends and, once her children had grown and were busy with their own families, there was little she enjoyed more than meeting one or more of those many friends for lunch at a local restaurant. Alice and Bill's home was always very lively and one of those where all the kids liked to gather. It was full of children and teens, whether their own or the friends of their children. Ever present and welcoming, Alice became affectionately known to all as "Big Al." And when "Mrs. Godfrey" was greeted by one of her many former students while out and about in the community, she was thrilled to respond with a warm smile and hug. And even when she did not quite remember each of their names, she was always ready with "Blessed" as a welcome substitute. Alice is survived by six of her and Bill's children, Peter (Sharyn), Stephen (Kathy), MaryAlice (David Dick), Sally Godfrey, Joan Grubert (Duane) and Emily Bowring (Doug). She was predeceased by their son Joseph. She took particular delight and pride in her grandchildren, Zach and Samantha Godfrey, Elizabeth Warner, Jessica and Nick Godfrey, Alex, Madeleine, Rosalind and MaryCharlotte Dick-Godfrey, William, MarySarah and Richel Shea, Emily and Olivia Grubert, and Boyd, Peter, Amanda, Clark & Webber Bowring. She celebrated her great-grandchildren, Jack, Rylan and Finley Warner, and two more, by Samantha and Madeleine, expected within days of each other in February. She was predeceased by her great-granddaughter Taylor Grace Warner. Whether Mom, Grandma or Big Al, Alice will be missed by many. But when she was called from and departed this world, she left behind a lasting legacy and passed confident in the promises fulfilled in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Services were private and arranged by Cabot & Sons, Pasadena. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to The Carmelite Sisters of the Most Sacred Heart of Los Angeles, 920 East Alhambra Road, Alhambra, California 91801-2799.
