One striking detail of this gadget boom is that the horsemen of the once- inevitable gadget apocalypse have slowed to a trot. Gartner, the research firm and consultancy, estimated that smartphone sales fell by 20% in the second quarter of the year, when much of the world was dealing with severe and increasing COVID-19 caseloads and economies in steep decline. There are new game consoles on the horizon, but they're not yet out; the breakout device in the gaming industry was also the most gadgety of its peers -- the 3-year-old Nintendo Switch.

With four defenders sidelined by injury, Monk gave deadline-day loan signing Aden Flint his debut and called upon Massimo Luongo to fill in at centre-back. It was needs must.
 Yet the game plan Monk and his technical team plan devised worked to perfection.
 Their formation was 3-5-2 without the ball but it turned into a 4-4-2 system when they were attacking with Luongo dropping into midfield (more on him later). It completely bamboozled the hosts for 70 minutes.
 The front two of Josh Windass and Callum Paterson set the tone. They ran themselves into the ground, pressing and harrying Birmingham's shaky-looking back four into submission.
 Some of their football in the first period was very pleasing on the eye. The Owls could have been out of sight at half-time had they shown more of a cutting edge in front of goal. Neil Etheridge produced a fine save in the first half to keep Adam Reach at bay, Windass hit the woodwork with a free- kick, Paterson glanced wide after a peach of a cross from Moses Odubajo and Reach fired over the bar when well-placed.

The defense had several good moments during the game, but started to wear down in the second half. West Virginia ran 28 more plays than the Jayhawks and won the time of possession battle.
 It put the defense in bad positions, but Lee said it is the job of the defense no matter what the situation is.
 “That's not my problem,” Lee said. “You'd love to get some long drives and some points, but, at the end of the day, I'm here to play defense and it's not really my concern what the offense is doing. It's my job just to stop them from getting into the end zone.”
 The defensive line accounted for 12 tackles, three for a loss and Lee’s interception. He believes the line will continue to improve and grow since many of them have been in the program for a year or less.
 “Marcus Harris, DaJon Terry, Jereme Robinson, and Caleb Taylor, we've got a lot of them,” he said. “We've got a lot of really young guys in there. I know Caleb Sampson and myself, we still have two years of eligibility after this. We will see if Sam wants to come back up here after this season. There's a lot of room for improvement. We've only been with each other for about a year. The ceiling is really, really, high. I've got a lot of optimism for our group.”

In June 1971, a young Member of Parliament stood up to initiate a discussion, calling for the government of India to accord diplomatic recognition to the Bangladesh government-in exile based in the Bangladeshi town of Mujibnagar that functioned as the provisional government, while its leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was in a Karachi prison.
 The MP, 36-year-old Pranab Mukherjee, spoke at length about the precedents to intervention in world history, and the brutal atrocities being carried out in Bangladesh that necessitated Indian action.
 “I am talking of a political solution which means categorically recognising the sovereign democratic government of Bangladesh. Political solution means giving material help to the democratic, sovereign government of Bangladesh,” he said.
 The speech and his memories of 1971 and the liberation war of Bangladesh are in one of the last long articles the former Indian president completed before he died in August, a part of an anthology of essays in honour of the birth centenary year of Mujib, as Bangladesh’s founding father is known.
 The book, called Voice of Millions, was published earlier this year but is yet to be launched formally. What makes the essay more poignant is that Mukherjee was due to address another session of Bangladesh Parliament, this time a special session on March 22-23 to mark the Mujib centenary, and also to attend the book’s launch. However, the functions in Dhaka were put off due to the coronavirus pandemic, and when they are held, the former MP, minister and president will not be a part of them.
 According to the editors of the book, Mukherjee was the only foreign dignitary asked to contribute, and he readily agreed to their request.
 “Mr Mukherjee was invited to contribute to the book as a ‘family member’ of the Prime Minister,” explained Asif Kabir, part of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman centenary committee, referring to the close relationship he shared with Mujib’s daughter and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
 Mukherjee’s private secretary, Abhijeet Rai, said the essay, which was the last extensive piece penned by the late president, needed considerable research on Mujib’s life and political career and Mukherjee drew from Mujib’s own Unfinished Memoirs that were published years after his death by Hasina. Mujib was freed only after the Pakistan army surrendered in Dhaka in December 1971, and as recorded by Mukherjee, for many days he was kept unaware of the incidents, while Pakistan’s soon to be president, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, attempted to negotiate with him. Eventually, Bhutto gave up and Mujib returned to a triumphant welcome in Dhaka with a brief stopover in Delhi to thank Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for India’s support.
 The book contains an emotive essay by Hasina, titled “My Brothers”, who along with her sister Rehana, were the only survivors when Mujib, his wife, all his other children and their spouses (15 family members in all) were gunned down at their home by army officers a few years later in 1975. In later years, when Hasina was in exile herself and lived in Delhi with her family, it was Mukherjee and his wife Suvra Mukherjee, who had lived in East Bengal before Partition, who became their closest friends.
 “It’s so hard to lose one’s parents even when they have a natural death,” said Mukherjee’s daughter and Congress leader Sharmishtha Mukherjee. “It is unimaginable what Sheikh Hasina has gone through, and I think the bond between her and my parents was stronger because she needed emotional support at the time.”
 Sharmishtha Mukherjee also recalled that during a visit to Delhi as prime minister, Hasina wanted to visit Suvra Mukherjee at home. As he was a “stickler for protocol”, Pranab Mukherjee, who was then finance minister, conveyed his discomfort to Hasina’s office. Hasina’s reply was: “I am not visiting the Minister, but my Boudi [sister-in-law in Bangla].”

Richard William Segraves   August 21, 1947 - October 2, 2020   Wichita, Kansas - Richard William Segraves was born on 21 August 1947 in Wellington, Kansas to Carl and Mary Segraves. After graduating from Newton High School, where he purportedly had the highest IQ score the school had seen to that date, he matriculated to Kansas State University. He joined the Air Force, working in intelligence, rising to the rank of staff sergeant and being stationed in Okinawa, Japan and Germany. In Germany, he met the mother of his two children. Richard matriculated to Oklahoma State University where he earned a 4.0 in every subject except his major which was accounting. Lynne Dodenhoff Segraves and Richard were married and raised two children, David and Elizabeth. Richard got to know his three grandchildren, Christopher "CJ", Alexander, and Shaylee before he passed.   Richard loved the outdoors. He loved hunting, fishing, and camping. Richard loved teaching young children how to fish, successfully teaching children, nephews, nieces, and grandchildren alike. He was an intrepid jokester, never shying away from going over the top. But for his children, Richard would do anything. He served as a scout master for Troop 515, after having helped camp outs and other outings from the time his son was a tiger cub onward.   Richard lived by his own code. He loved his family. He did not worry about what others thought of him. In the end, he raised two kids who turned out great. Nothing else matters.   In lieu of flowers, you can make a donation to Troop 515, by sending it to Blessed Sacrament Church care of Troop 515 at 124 N. Roosevelt, Wichita, KS 67208.

4° Siendo así, es rotundamente evidente que por más que el art. 45 de la C.N sostenga que la Cámara de Diputados se compondrá de representantes del pueblo lo cual se compadece con los ya citados arts. 1 y 22 del mismo texto, ello no deja de ser más que una fake news institucional toda vez que los diputados no representan al pueblo sino a los partidos políticos que ejercen el monopolio de tal representación. De tal forma, el representante no se encuentra ligado a instrucción o mandato alguno de sus electores, sino que sólo debe responder a sus propias convicciones, lo que lo convierte así “en el ‘señor’ investido por sus electores y no en el ‘servidor’ de los mismos. Y esta característica se aprecia modernamente en los Parlamentos a través de la acción de los partidos políticos ya que éstos son los que presentan los candidatos y los programas a los ciudadanos políticamente pasivos y por compromiso o votación dentro del Parlamento crean las normas para la administración, la controlan, apoyan gobiernos con su confianza y los derriban también cuando se la rehúsan de un modo permanente, siempre que hayan podido obtener la mayoría en las elecciones” (Weber) Se advierte entonces que las constituciones “tratan a las asambleas legislativas como si estuviesen compuestas de representantes soberanos y con libre potestad de decisión, en una atmósfera desinfectada de partidos” siendo que los representantes acceden al Parlamento a través de las listas de candidatos que presentan los partidos políticos, encontrándose generalmente sometidos a las instrucciones y potestad disciplinaria de esos mismos partidos. Por tanto “se repetirá hasta la saciedad la mística espuria de que el miembro del parlamento representa a la nación entera, siendo el resultado práctico que el parlamentario puede cambiar de partido según su voluntad, sin tener que temer que sus electores le pidan cuentas por ello” (Loewenstein)

In mid-November, Paul finally came round – but, unable to walk or talk, it was clear his recovery was going to be incredibly difficult.
 Over the next few weeks, his speech improved and he regained some movement in his arms and legs.
 “I would sit and talk to him, squeezing his hand,” said Tracey. “At first, it was almost impossible to understand him, but he made great progress and was even able to tell me he loved me again.”
 In January 2018, Paul was moved to a specialist rehabilitation unit for people with brain injuries in Bristol, Somerset.
 There, he continued to go from strength to strength – even managing to stand with the help of extensive physiotherapy and a special walking aid.
 But in March, everything came crashing down once again.
 “I went in for my usual daily visit and, overnight, Paul had gone completely backwards,” said Tracey.
 “He couldn’t speak or move. To this day, nobody has any idea why. He’s had so many tests but they’ve all come back clear. Doctors suggested it might have been a secondary infection, but we will never know for sure.”

Jerry left us on September 12, 2020, after a long illness.Jerry was a proud native of Wisconsin who loved Idaho with his heart and soul. His goal was to spend as much time as possible in the Idaho mountains hunting the wiley elk. He and Karen logged many miles together in those mountains. Jerry and Karen had two children, Becky and Jesse, and when the kids were young most weekends were spent camping as a family. Jerry loved hosting hunting camps for family and friends at Bear Valley. Hunting season didn't last all year long so much time was also spent fishing Idaho lakes.Jerry was a good man, admirable and solid, and he took great care of his family and his beloved dogs. He is dearly missed by his wife, Karen, daughter Rebecca and her husband Rick Sheppard (Liberty Lake, WA), his son, Jesse (Post Falls, ID), and by his special girls, granddaughters Emma Korpi, and Grace, Sophie and Hannah Sheppard.

Michael Onwenu stepped on the scale and immediately Thomas Wilcher was surprised.
   
 Onwenu was a 15-year-old freshman at Cass Technical High School in Detroit at the time. The teenager looked like a man already with legs like oak trees to go with a wingspan of 82 inches. When the scale read just over 330 pounds, however, his high school coach realized how big he truly was.
   
 "That's how he got the name 'Big Mike,' " Wilcher said. "We couldn't believe that he weighed that much."
   
 That kicked off a central theme in Onwenu's life. He holds his weight well, but his weight was a blessing and a curse. Throughout high school, he was ridiculously strong. He was able to bench press well over 200 pounds as a freshman. As he continued to grow, he developed into a legitimate Division I prospect. That scale read 370 pounds by the time he was a senior.
   
 People always asked the same questions.
   
 Is he too big? Is he unhealthy? Is he working hard enough?
   
 That bothered Onwenu. That's why Wilcher, who ran track and played football for Michigan, tried to get his pupil not only comfortable in his own body, but also focused on ways he could improve his eating habits. Once he did those things, Wilcher knew the sky was the limit.
   
 "He's created a better outlook towards life," Wilcher said, adding that Onwenu got past people focusing on his weight. "He's come to identify that's who he is and he knows how to look good, how to look healthy, and how to be supportive of himself. And that's the most important thing right there. He's a very strong character now because of who he is and what he has learned about himself."
   
 A big part of Onwenu's journey involves that scale. Instead of the number holding him back, Onwenu has consistently used it to prove people wrong. That's what's happening in New England with the Patriots.
   
 Family values
   
 Stephen and Roseline Onwenu were born in Nigeria and came to the United States to make a better life. Roseline is a business owner, operating Detroit's Sterose International Boutique, a clothing store that specializes in head geles (a piece of fabric wrapped by hand around the head to form an often flamboyant head wrap.) Stephen is a hard-working corrections officer in the city.
   
 They raised their son Michael to be a hard-working and a serious student. That's what Tim Drevno noticed when he started to recruit Onwenu for Michigan. The teenager's size was obvious, but the Wolverines offensive line coach saw more than just that.
   
 "They're a really tight knit family that loved each other. It's one of those things -- you can see why he blossomed," Drevno said. "(On the field), he moved really well. He had really good initial quickness in terms of foot speed and agility for a big guy for 370-plus pounds. Some people make his weight a big issue like, 'Oh, gosh, he's too heavy.' If he's able to move and move with functional movement things, it was good enough for me."
   
 When Onwenu entered Michigan in 2016, no one wanted him to play at 370 pounds. At first, the goal was to get him under 365. Coaches saw unbelievable strength and athleticism for a guy this size, but trainers wanted him to be at a healthier weight.
   
 Drevno explained that the trainers would never ask Onwenu to be 330 pounds and added that "would be strictly impossible." It was more about getting him to an ideal size to take advantage of his strength without losing any of it.
   
 "He's a big guy. He's got really good lower body girth. Hard to move. And the D lineman at Michigan used to tell me he used to have a death grip," Drevno said. "If he got his hands on you, you're done.... He's that strong. He could probably just condition and be just fine because he's got that brute strength."
   
 Fine-tuning his body
   
 Ed Warinner became the Michigan offensive line coach when Onwenu was a junior. When he looked over the roster and saw Big Mike's height and weight, he thought the same thing many people did.
   
 Was this healthy? Is he working hard enough?
   
 Those worries went away thanks to a DEXA scan machine that measures body composition. At Michigan, along with body fat percentage, they also measure bone density.
   
 "The assumption is that being that big, you have to be carrying a lot of fat … and his (readings) were as good as anybody on the O-line," Warinner said. "It's his bone density, his thickness, his muscle mass, that's what's incredible on him. It's not that he weighs 360 or whatever because he has 30 pounds extra fat that he could lose.
   
 "He's just a big, thick human being. People presume things, I being one of them. 'Oh, God, you can't play at that weight.' But we have some really science-oriented people on our nutrition and weight staff and so they did a lot of studies on him and we got him down."
   
 Onwenu had natural talent, but Warinner wanted to see him attack practice as hard as he attacked the games. The staff also wanted him to get his weight below 360 pounds. Following his junior year, Onwenu put it upon himself to make dietary changes. When he returned to Michigan as a senior, he hit 350 pounds -- dropping 20 pounds from his high school senior year.
   
 In that 2019 season Warinner saw a player that could take on any defensive lineman one-on-one. He saw an NFL offensive lineman.
   
 "For him, he became a really good player here when he started to practice at a high level, when he took practice really seriously and worked his [butt] off," Warinner said. "And when he started doing that, then it manifests itself in the games with better play. He took his diet and weight and conditioning to a new level."
   
 Getting noticed
   
 People tend to forget about the scale when Onwenu steps on the field.
   
 A sixth-round pick, Onwenu has turned into the biggest surprise for the Patriots. He's started all four games and even more impressive, he's played four different positions -- right tackle, left guard, right guard and jumbo tight end. This is after he played only guard in college.
   
 In his last start, at right guard, Onwenu didn't allow a single pressure on the quarterback. Following that game against the Super Bowl-champion Chiefs, Pro Football Focus had Onwenu as the highest-graded rookie in the NFL. His 92.2 mark is also the highest ever given to a rookie through the first four weeks of the regular season, dating back to 2006.
   
 How did the NFL miss on Michael Onwenu? How did he last until the sixth round, pick 182?
   
 It turns out the rookie couldn't escape questions about his weight. Add in COVID-19 and most teams didn't get to see him in person. It hurt his draft stock.
   
 "He probably slipped because of the measurable and maybe some people got scared of his weight," Drevno said. "But I think that the Patriots did a heck of a job. ... They started to figure out what the kid's wiring is. 'Does he process quick on his feet? Does he panic? Can he stay with the focus on the task at hand? Is he mature? Can he retain information? Can he not be a repeat offender?' Those are the things that you see in him. I knew he was an NFL guy when I got him out of high school and when I coached him."
   
 At the NFL Combine, Onwenu weighed 344 pounds, which was remarkable considering he entered college at 370. Despite the drop in weight, he was the heaviest interior offensive lineman at the combine. For the workouts, he opted to participate only in the bench press. He didn't know he wouldn't get a chance to participate in Michigan's Pro Day due to the pandemic. He was able to visit the Patriots and Miami before the pandemic canceled the rest of his visits.
   
 "No one ever got to put their hands on him," Warinner said. "So there was really no data and as you know, the NFL is big on all these numbers. … All I know is he's a really good player. And sometimes, certain places and people use those numbers more than the film. If people would have worked him out, they would have [seen] what I saw every day for two years."
   
 That number on a scale might have followed him to the NFL, but his results speak louder. Michael Onwenu is a big man. He always has been. He's also a talented football player.
   
 That's the focus now.

The vast majority of trips this fall will be road trips, according to a recent AAA travel survey.
 The survey showed that 80% of all trips in the fall will be automobile travel.
 “The pandemic has given many Americans a reason to dream about their next getaway,” Bevi Powell, senior vice president, AAA East Central, said in a press release. “This is leading to a rise in road trips to scenic American destinations.”
 In a sign of the rising popularity of auto travel this fall, use of AAA’s road trip planning tool has doubled compared to the spring and early summer, the release said.
 Lower prices at the gas pump may also be motivating some would-be travelers to hit the road this fall. On average, gas prices nationally are nearly 50 cents cheaper than this time last year and are the cheapest fall prices since 2016. West Virginia gas prices are averaging just over $2.20 a gallon for regular unleaded, according to AAA.
 The West Virginia Tourism Office is recommending a fall foliage road trip as colors are spreading from the eastern mountains to the north-central regions of the state.
 “Fall color is popping up all over the state,” said West Virginia Tourism Commissioner Chelsea Ruby. “While some of our higher elevations have peaked, there are still several weeks’ worth of leaf peeping ahead in southern West Virginia and the panhandles.”

Ronald G. Osborn   May 3, 1937 - October 14, 2020   Lee's Summit, Missouri - Ronald Gene Osborn, 83 years old, passed away October 14, 2020. Ron was born May 3, 1937, the son of Ernest Lonzo Osborn and Leona Pearl Hughes.   Ron grew up in Springfield, MO, and moved to Kansas City in 1956 to work with his brother at Armour Packing Co. His early work experience convinced him of the value of technology and laid the foundation for his next five decades in business. Ron's entrepreneurial spirit and work ethic led him to start Info- Data Services, along with a handful of other businesses, and consult with other major companies in Kansas City. Ron served on the board of The Boys and Girls Club of Kansas City, Music Arts Institute, the Board of Governors of the American Royal, and Chair of the Kansas City Better Business Bureau.   Ron's success in business was only surpassed by the love he had for his family, which he considered his greatest accomplishment. To all that knew him, Ron's zest for life, constant desire to teach and serve his family, and irrepressible humor and spirit were ever present.   Ron is survived by his wife, Nancy Osborn of Lee's Summit, MO, their two children, son Jason (Jessica) Osborn of Lee's Summit, MO, and daughter Kate (Matt) Altenhofen of Overland Park, KS, daughter Shari (Nathan) Scott of Kansas City, MO, son Ronald (Karen) Osborn, Jr. of Camdenton, MO, and twin sister Donna Kessel of St. Louis, MO. Ron was blessed with twelve grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.   A funeral service will be held at 1 o'clock p.m. on Monday, October 26th, 2020, at Northland Cathedral, 101 NW 99th St., Kansas City, MO 64155, with a socially distanced reception to follow. In lieu of flowers, donations in Ron's memory may be made to Ascend Hospice, 783 NE Anderson Lane, Lee's Summit, MO 64064. Arrangements are with Speaks Chapels.

Lopez was favored 119-109, 117-111 and 116-112 on ringside scorecards in a bout held without fans at the MGM Grand conference center. The Associated Press had Lopez winning 117-111.
 Lopez proved faster and stronger than the 32-year-old Lomachenko, who won two Olympic gold medals as an amateur and was regarded as one of the top pound- for-pound fighters as a pro. Surprisingly enough, he was also the better boxer and proved he could close the show by bloodying Lomachenko’s eye in the 12th round.
 “I had to dig deep, man,”’ Lopez said. “I’m a fighter, I’ve got to dig in deep.”
 Lomachenko, ordinarily a slow starter, was too slow this time as he gave away rounds early as he tried to figure out the style of Lopez. By the time the fight got competitive in the eighth round he was too far behind to come back.

Richard (Dick) Percy King   October 6, 2020   Countryside, Kansas - Richard (Dick) Percy King, age 88, of Countryside, Kansas passed away peacefully on October 6, 2020. After spending time in a rehabilitation center, he was released to the loving and devoted care of Maria and Roger Baker of Countryside who brought him home to surround him with love for his remaining time on Earth. Maria and Roger invited friends to welcome him home and through this thoughtful act, he knew that he was loved.   Dick was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on January 10, 1932. He enjoyed his early years with his parents, Metha and Percy King and his sister, Shirley. He attended primary and secondary schools in Lincoln and graduated from Lincoln High School in 1950. In his youth, he enjoyed playing basketball with friends and lettered in track where his special talent was throwing the shot put. During his high school years, he earned the rank of Eagle Scout – an honor that is bestowed upon few and an accomplishment for which he and his family were extremely proud. Upon high school graduation, he entered the University of Nebraska at Lincoln where he earned a degree in business.   Dick was bitten by the travel bug early in life and after graduation he traveled with friends to far off places which included Israel, Egypt, and other locations in the Middle East. He then joined the United States Coast Guard and served his county for several years by becoming a specialist in radio communications. He was stationed both overseas, including Midway, Hawaii and the Philippines, and in the US at locations on the East Coast and points along the Mississippi River. After completing his military service, he settled in the Kansas City area, where he began working for the Department of Agriculture in the early days of mainframe computing. He served the Department for the entirety of his career and retired in 1987.   While working in Kansas City, he met Marilyn Stadsklev and quickly knew she was 'the one'. They married in 1964 and began their life together in Countryside, Kansas, where they lived together for 54 years. Dick loved their home in Countryside and cherished the close friendships that he and Marilyn developed with neighbors over the years. Marilyn shared Dick's passion for travel and they both sought adventures that took them to locations throughout Europe and the United States.   Dick had many interests. He loved to fish and spent many happy hours on the Lake of the Ozarks and on a favorite fishing hole at Marilyn's family farm in Florida. He learned to fly and became an experienced private pilot. After being inspired by a professional photographer, Dick taught himself the art of photography and became extremely accomplished. His special interest was candid shots of the culture and people in the countries he visited. Dick spent many happy hours on the golf course and was highly knowledgeable about professionals in the sport. Most of all, Dick adored Marilyn and genuinely loved his family and friends. He loved spending time with them and building memories that he enjoyed retelling over the years.   Dick was predeceased by his wife, Marilyn in 2018 and is survived by his sister, Shirley King Berry and brother-in-law, George Berry of Denison, Iowa; brother-in law, Tom Stadsklev (Joan) of Marianna Florida; sister-in-law, Charlotte Brasington of Satellite Beach, Florida; niece, Susan Berry Hill (Chris) of Lovettsville, Virginia; and three nephews, Scott (Kim), Kirk (Patti), and Eric (Shanti) Brasington all of Satellite Beach, Florida. He has eight grand nieces and nephews. He is also survived by Maria and Roger Baker, who were sent from the Heavenly Father to extend His loving hand to care for Dick in his final years.   Dick will be interred with his beloved wife, Marilyn at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The memorial will take place in January 2021 in Florida. Dick was passionate about the homeless. In lieu of flowers kindly consider donations to Salvation Army or City Union Mission of Kansas City in his name.

One of the hardest hit sports in the state this year due to the restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic was girls swimming.
   
 Both Adrian and Tecumseh's teams were hurt by the delayed starts, but Tecumseh, who was even more delayed and was a few weeks behind their rivals from down M-52, has had a solid rebound so far considering that Tecumseh's team was restricted to doing out-of-pool work for the first few weeks in coach Sarah Zietlow's third season at the helm, being aided by her junior captains Kylie Balent and Amelia Danley.
   
 "They were that connection point for the girls, because they couldn't necessarily get together as a group, but they could stay in contact with their group chats and different things like that," said Zietlow. "They were really helpful in keeping everybody together, on the same page and keeping us moving forward."
   
 Neither one of Lenawee's swim and dive programs has a diver this season, as while Tecumseh's girls team didn't carry a diver last year, Adrian graduated Division 3 state champion and current NCAA Division I diver with Eastern Michigan, Annabelle Rosen-Hurley, and did not replace her for 2020.
   
 That being said, the Adrian team, totaling 10 swimmers, has made strides even in the midst of a pandemic behind the leadership of coach Robert Petkus along with the Maples' captains, Gwendolyn Frolich, Emma Mehan and Jasmine Rice.
   
 "Our growth has been extremely impressive all the way through," said Petkus. "I know Tecumseh graduated some of its top seniors last year, so we can't think it's all our growth, but for the most part, we've been lucky enough to be in the pool since August, and I know (Tecumseh) had been struggling with pool time up until everything started. Right now, I'm happy with how we've progressed, even in this whacky season."
   
 The Maples may not have any MHSAA state qualifiers yet, but Petkus feels that Adrian has several events that, with the Southeastern Michigan Independent Swim League and Southeastern Conference final meets still to come, that could see them hit qualifying times.
   
 "We have our (100 butterfly swimmer) Audrey Force fairly close to (the state qualifying mark)," said Petkus, "and our 200-yard freestyle relay team is close. We're looking to take a couple points back against Tecumseh going into the SMISL and SEC meets, see what we can do there. Looking forward to going against teams that we've had close meets against. Pinckney was close, Lincoln was close, they're small but strong."
   
 For Tecumseh, which also has a 10-girl strong team in 2020, the rebound from not even having the ability to do their standard workouts in the pool to the current point, which has the team now with qualifiers in five events (three individual and two relays). Linda Hensley has two of the individual qualifying times set Thursday in the 200 free and 100 breaststroke and Makayla Sanders the other one in the 50 free to lead a Tecumseh team surging towards the summit of its season as Danley has been close to hitting the state-qualifying marks in the 100 backstroke and 100 butterfly.
   
 "Makayla has done a good job this year in terms of just showing up and being a leader by example," said Zietlow. "Evelyn Adams came out to the team this year and she's made tremendous strides in just learning new skills for swimming, and Izzy Hennings has done a really nice job as well. One of her big things this year was 'Coach, I've made all the intervals this year so far,' and I was like 'Yeah, that's really awesome,' so they've had a lot of different types of success, not just wins this year given the circumstances."
   
 As Tecumseh's season rolls towards its end, Zietlow is focused in on not only giving her squad the best chances now, but also in the future, as Tecumseh, barring the unforeseen, will return all 10 of its swimmers for the 2021 season.
   
 "This is more of a building or stepping stone year since we've had so much time out of the water," said Zietlow. "Most of our girls are year-round swimmers, and they had a six-month break where they weren't able to do anything, so we're trying to get people back into shape, get their bases back, get their strength back up and then just move forward from there."
