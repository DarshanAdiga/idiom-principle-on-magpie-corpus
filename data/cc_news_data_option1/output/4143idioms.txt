It was a well-deserved win for the Seahawks, even if they had to fight a bit more. The pass rush looked good, while the Miami run game failed to get off the ground. Through the first three weeks, the “bend, don’t break” mentality of the Seahawk defense looked very questionable, even while they were winning games.
