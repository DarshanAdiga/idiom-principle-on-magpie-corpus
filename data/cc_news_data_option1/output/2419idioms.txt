riuscito a dormire, almeno un po’?   «No… appena chiudo gli occhi riparte quel film».   Quale film?   «La salita, il camion che arranca, cambio marcia, la curva a sinistra, la macchina della municipale che mi viene incontro, il gruppo di ciclisti, Zanardi che sbanda… E io che sterzo a destra provando ad evitarlo. Ma era impossibile. Non c’era spazio».   A casa di Marco, la mattina dopo, c’è odore di caffè. Quella appena trascorsa è stata una notte senza sonno. Nell’appartamento a Castelnuovo Berardenga, nel Senese, i tre figli hanno appena finito di fare colazione. Le tazze e i biscotti alla cioccolata sono sul tavolo. «Mi scusi per il disordine, vuole anche lei un caffè?», si affretta a dire la moglie.   L’ospitalità sincera di una famiglia di brave persone, con l’animo oppresso da una storia più grande di loro.   Marco («il cognome no per favore, voglio tutelare i bambini») ha 44 anni e da quando ne aveva 20 guida autocarri per l’azienda che fu del padre e ora è del fratello maggiore.   Ha viaggiato ovunque in Italia. La strada da Pienza a Montalcino l’ha percorsa tante volte, non ha mai avuto problemi. Mai, fino al pomeriggio di venerdì. Le 16.45, quella curva, Alex.   Cos’è successo, Marco?   «L’ho visto con i miei occhi sbandare e cadere. Ha come perso il controllo del mezzo. Prima ha invaso un po’ la mia corsia, poi è caduto a terra sbattendo la spalla sinistra. È stato un secondo, le ruote della sua handbike erano per aria. Ho provato ad allargarmi sulla destra rischiando di andare fuori strada, ma se non l’avessi fatto sarebbe stato un frontale. Con la coda dell’occhio l’ho visto sparire, ho temuto che fosse finito sotto le ruote».   A che velocità stava andando?   «Io non più di 30 chilometri all’ora. Il camion era a pieno carico, stavo trasportando cereali da consegnare al Consorzio Agrario di Sinalunga, e la strada, nella mia direzione, era leggermente in salita».   Il gruppo di Zanardi a quanto   andava?   «Piano non andava, ma non so di preciso. Nel drappello c’erano 7-8 ciclisti, mi pare. Era preceduto da un’auto della municipale, bianca e rossa, e dietro c’erano altre due automobili».   Ha capito subito che si trattava di Alex Zanardi?   «No, ero troppo sconvolto. Mi sono fermato appena sentito l’impatto: ho alzato la tavoletta dell’acceleratore e il camion, così pesante e in salita, si è arrestato immediatamente. Sono sceso, e già attorno ad Alex si era formato un capannello di persone che gli stavano prestando soccorso.   Ero ammutolito. Sono riuscito solo a comporre il numero di mia moglie.   Non ricordo bene quando mi hanno detto che quell’uomo a terra era Zanardi». (La moglie gli si avvicina, lo conforta stringendogli il braccio. «È un uomo sensibile, è ancora sotto choc…»). «Proprio Zanardi… Una grandissima persona, lo ammiro per il suo coraggio, per tutto quello che ha saputo fare nella vita. Come sta?».   È grave, in rianimazione.   «Speriamo che ce la faccia anche questa volta».   È una strada pericolosa, quella?   «Un ciclista mi ha detto che la curva dell’incidente è "bastarda", perché se non stai attento il leggero pendio ti porta a invadere l’altra corsia. Pare succeda spesso».   C’era qualche segnalazione?   «No, zero. Un chilometro prima ho notato una macchina parcheggiata lungo il ciglio della strada, credo fosse della provinciale, con una donna al posto di guida. Non stava segnalando niente. Poi, dopo alcune curve, ho visto arrivare la colonna dei ciclisti, preceduta di pochi metri dall’auto della municipale. Era come se la stesse scortando facendo da apripista, ma non aveva lampeggianti e nessuno sventolava bandierine per avvertire del passaggio, come ho visto fare durante le gare. Comunque, ripeto, io andavo a trenta all’ora ed ero nella mia corsia».   È stato sottoposto all’alcol test?   «Sì. Era negativo. Negativo anche il tossicologico. Sono molto ligio, non mi hanno mai ritirato la patente».   Era al telefono quando ha incrociato il gruppo di ciclisti?   «No. E comunque ho l’auricolare e il vivavoce nella cabina».   Il suo camion è molto grosso e ha un rimorchio. Poteva circolare in quel tratto?   «Sì, non ci sono divieti per i tir. Del resto passano tutti di lì, è una via molto trafficata».   Si sente di dire qualcosa alla famiglia di Zanardi?   «Sono distrutto dal dolore, ma neanche immagino quello che possano provare in queste ore la moglie e il figlio di Alex. Mi dispiace tantissimo. Appena avrò modo, voglio parlare con loro. Lo farò, ma non attraverso il giornale».

Fair trade regulator CCI is adopting a multi-pronged approach, including nudging entities to desist from anti-competitive practices, to ensure there is no violation of the competition law and is extremely pro- active in responding to challenges due to COVID-19, according to a top official. While acknowledging that COVID-19 has thrown new challenges for competition regulators, CCI Chairperson Ashok Kumar Gupta emphasised the competition law is quite flexible and forward looking . Competition Commission of India (CCI) works to prevent unfair business ways in the market place and has powers, including to penalise as well as direct entities to cease and desist from such practices. In a recent e-mail interview, Gupta said the regulator is adopting a multi-pronged approach to ensure that the law is not infringed. Apart from responding to formal filings, CCI, through scanning of media reports, keeps a watch on the anti-competitive conduct and behaviour of the market players. Once a prima facie case gets established, the same is taken up suo-motu to initiate inquiries. Needless to mention, CCI also supplements and complements such enforcement actions through advocacy initiatives by nudging the parties to desist from adopting and following anti- competitive practices and policies, he said. In the wake of COVID-19, the watchdog has taken a series of administrative and regulatory steps. Among other measures, arrangements were made for parties concerned to electronically file anti-trust cases as well as combination notices. Also, matters for internal consideration were dealt with through video conferencing. Gupta said a dedicated helpline was set up to attend to the queries of stakeholders during the pandemic and all urgent receipts from government/ statutory bodies as also representations were processed electronically and relevant inputs were provided expeditiously. CCI has been extremely proactive in responding to the challenges arising out of outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic both on the administrative side as well as on the regulatory front, he said. To deal with significant changes in supply and demand patterns arising out of the extraordinary situation due to the pandemic, Gupta said CCI issued an advisory for guidance of businesses. According to him, the in-built safeguards of the Competition Act to protect businesses from sanctions for certain coordinated conduct were highlighted, provided such arrangements result in increasing efficiencies. However, it was cautioned that only such conduct of businesses which is necessary and proportionate to address concerns arising from COVID-19 will be considered. Businesses were, however, warned not to take advantage of COVID-19 to contravene any of the provisions of the Act, he said. When asked whether he thinks the pandemic has resulted in a paradigm shift that will require competition regulators worldwide to recalibrate the way markets and business practices are assessed, Gupta replied in the affirmative. No doubt, COVID-19 has thrown new challenges for competition regulators. Fortunately, our law is quite flexible and forward looking and it equips the Commission to address the challenges arising out of COVID-19 like situations, he noted.

Sollten die Anteilseigner am Donnerstag nicht zustimmen, würde dies bedeuten, "dass die Deutsche Lufthansa AG möglicherweise zeitnah zur Hauptversammlung ein insolvenzrechtliches Schutzschirmverfahren beantragen müsste, wenn es dann nicht unverzüglich zu einer anderen Lösung kommt", warnte die Fluggesellschaft. Auch eine Insolvenz in Eigenverwaltung schloss sie nicht aus.
 Die entscheidende Rolle bei der Hauptversammlung liegt beim Unternehmer Thiele (79). Er hat zuletzt seinen Lufthansa-Anteil auf mehr als 15 Prozent aufgestockt. Die Airline fürchtet, dass er den staatlichen Rettungsplan blockieren könnte.
 Thiele hat das Paket kritisiert, vor allem den geplanten Einstieg des Bundes. "Ich bin der festen Überzeugung, dass der Staat nicht der beste Unternehmer ist", so der Unternehmer in einem Interview. Zugleich betonte er, die Aufstockung seines Anteils sei "kein Signal, auf der Hauptversammlung gegen irgendetwas zu stimmen". Thiele monierte, dass Lufthansa-Chef Carsten Spohr nicht die mit dem Bund behandelten Alternativen benannt habe. Die müsse der Vorstand auf den Tisch legen: "Ich glaube, man hätte intensiver verhandeln können."
 Sein Stimmverhalten auf der Hauptversammlung ließ Thiele offen. "Ich werde aber sicherlich hier nicht blockieren oder ausbremsen", sagte der Unternehmer, der Hauptaktionär beim Bremsen-Spezialist Knorr-Bremse ist. Er hoffe vielmehr, dass noch zuvor etwas bewirkt und in Bewegung gebracht werden könne.
 Thiele wolle an diesem Montagmorgen mit Finanzminister Olaf Scholz (SPD) und Lufthansa-Chef Spohr über das Rettungspaket sprechen, schrieb die "Bild am Sonntag" unter Berufung auf eigene Informationen. Auch das "Handelsblatt" hatte zuletzt berichtet, dass ein Gespräch geplant sei. Das Bundesfinanzministerium bekräftigte auf Anfrage am Sonntag, zu eventuellen Gesprächen im weiteren Verfahren äußere man sich nicht.
 Angesichts der Kritik von Thiele hält es der Lufthansa-Vorstand für möglich, dass das Rettungspaket an einer möglicherweise nötigen Zweidrittelmehrheit scheitern könnte. Das Management appellierte daher an die Aktionäre, ihr Stimmrecht wahrzunehmen.
 Auch die Gewerkschaften sind alarmiert. Die Aktionäre hätten eine Verantwortung, betonte die Flugbegleitergewerkschaft Ufo. Diese würden "über die Zukunft des Konzerns und seiner Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeiter mitentscheiden". Auch die Pilotengewerkschaft VC forderte die Aktionäre auf, für die Staatshilfe zu stimmen. "Ein Schutzschirmverfahren wäre hingegen unkalkulierbar", warnte sie.
 Die Staatshilfen sind aber nicht das einzige Thema, das die Lufthansa umtreibt. Vorstandschef Spohr will den Anteilseignern zudem ein Sparkonzept präsentieren. Es droht ein großer Stellenabbau. Den rechnerischen Überhang in der Corona-Krise beziffert der Konzern auf 22 000 Vollzeitstellen, die Hälfte entfalle auf Deutschland. Wie tief die Einschnitte ausfallen, wird mit den Gewerkschaften verhandelt. Auch damit stehen der Lufthansa ereignisreiche Tage bevor./als/DP/zb

Berry, Hosmann and Hockett were the top returning hitters. Berry finished 32-for-94 with 12 RBIs, 26 runs scored, six doubles and a triple in 2019, and Hockett was 29-for-90 with 13 RBIs, 13 runs scored, two doubles and a triple.
 Hosmann was 31-for-80 with 32 RBIs, 18 runs scored, 11 doubles and three home runs.
 Dorothy Dueck had 17 runs scored last year, and Kapsner finished 2-for-6 with two RBIs, three runs scored, a double and a home run.
 That strong group with the expected younger girls coming up to contribute gave Koltes and the coaching staff high hopes to catch people by surprise.
 “I think a lot of teams were trying to figure out how to get over the hump, and we’ve done that,” he said.
 Kapsner and Hosmann, who is headed to the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire to play softball, were other returners from 2019 that lost their chance at a second state title, but Koltes said that the disappointment of not playing could be balanced with knowing they finished their careers as state champions.
 But it was still a difficult time going through the month with the season suspended before it was officially canceled on April 23.
 Koltes said that the Crimson were able to have practices from Monday through Friday before scrimmages were called off on the Saturday when state girls basketball championships were canceled.
 There was an idea of what the full varsity roster would be, but nothing had been finalized.
 During that month, the staff did what it could with Zoom meetings and lunches and individual workout plans. Koltes said the staff was in contact with the captains and other players and families at least every other day.
 And now, there is the unknown of heading into 2021 with youth sports still up in the air and modified social distancing practices expected to be able to begin soon.
 Koltes said that the team does have plans at the end of July and August to get together and have scrimmages – to make the connections with the players again and see any improvements from club softball.
 The juniors and Berry from this year’s roster are all expected back with the class of younger players that will fill out the roster. That does make Koltes excited for 2021 to have a bit of experience and the talent from the upcoming class.
 “We look at it as maybe this junior group doesn’t get the chance to be the leaders this year that would have really catapulted us next year, but everybody is in the same boat by not having their younger kids be that leader up front,” Koltes said.

Such questions are critical to answer, particularly in a world grappling with COVID-19. For the past several months, the U.S. has been negotiating a Special Measures Agreement (SMA) with South Korea, a document that governs how much that country will contribute to the costs of hosting U.S. forces. Washington has had such agreements with Seoul since 1991; the latest one expired at the end of 2019 over disagreements on how much South Korea should contribute going forward. Another such agreement exists with Japan, governing that country’s host nation support for U.S. forces; negotiations over an updated SMA with Japan will be starting later this year.
 Yet the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the environment in which such talks take place. It is clear that the disease has the potential to reshape the global balance of power for the post-pandemic world, and the way the U.S. handles the SMA talks with its allies will play a major part in defining the future of Indo-Pacific security and the role that the U.S. will play in it. Success in these talks, therefore, is critical.
 Unfortunately, the talks with South Korea have gone poorly thus far. U.S. President Donald Trump initially wanted Seoul to increase its contributions to about $5 billion per year, a more than 500 percent increase from the $924 million it paid last year. Despite Seoul offering to increase its contributions to $1.3 billion, Trump rejected that offer in early April as too low. This does not bode well for the alliance.
 According to one poll in December 2019, just 4 percent of South Koreans supported their government meeting Trump’s demands. With no agreement in place, on April 1, local Korean employees who support U.S. facilities in South Korea were furloughed for the first time in the alliance’s history, a development that would have rippled through the Korean economy with negative consequences for Koreans’ views of their American ally had Seoul not stepped in to provide for these temporarily laid-off workers.
 And although the talks with Japan have yet to begin, one early report suggested the U.S. might be seeking a five-fold increase over its current five-year, $8.7 billion SMA. Should this turn out to be true, this too is likely to create friction in alliance relations.
 These demands have sent shock waves through Seoul and Tokyo. Not helping matters is the fact that confidence in Trump is low in both countries, with just 46 percent of South Koreans and 36 percent of Japanese reporting trust in the American president.
 Based on past discouraging statements by the president about South Korea and Japan, there are real fears in both countries that, should negotiations fail, the Trump administration might move to withdraw U.S. forces in part or in toto, leaving the allies to confront the threats of China and North Korea on their own. While Trump has denied any intention to withdraw troops, rumors to that effect continue to surface, forcing USINDOPACOM Cmdr. Admiral Philip Davidson to reiterate in November 2019 that he has “no plans to draw down troops” from South Korea.
 Even if no troops are pulled out of South Korea or Japan, there are real consequences to failed negotiations or talks that drag on or conclude with great acrimony. China and North Korea, after all, have long sought to create or take advantage of any seams or schisms in the policy positions between the U.S. and its allies through gray zone coercion, influence operations and hostile social manipulation, or political warfare, hoping to weaken and ultimately to break the U.S.-centered alliance network in the Indo-Pacific.
 Any discussion of allied contributions must start with an assessment of the relevant trends in defense budgets and spending by the two countries. Japan spends about $50 billion per year on defense, and has grown its defense spending consistently for the past eight years. It is home to strategic U.S. forces that themselves are responsible not just for Japan’s defense, but for regional security and defense of U.S. interests.
 Japanese companies also provide critical maintenance support to U.S. forces, saving them the trouble of having to return to the U.S. In addition to these contributions, Tokyo pays for the construction of facilities in Japan, such as the Futenma Replacement Facility in Okinawa, and for relocation costs and construction of new facilities elsewhere, such as the roughly $3 billion of the costs of relocating 4,000 U.S. Marines to Guam.
 Meanwhile, Japan has accelerated development of its amphibious forces and is developing capabilities in the new domains of cyberspace, outer space and the electromagnetic spectrum. Tokyo is also moving to beef up its defense capabilities through the purchase of, or expressed intent to procure, critical assets including stand-off missiles, E-2D Hawkeye early warning and command and control aircraft, three Global Hawk long-endurance surveillance UAVs, five V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft and 147 F-35s.
 For its part, South Korea spends 2.2 percent of its GDP on defense, totaling roughly $44 billion in 2020. In addition, Seoul paid for 90 percent of the $10 billion construction costs of Camp Humphreys, the new consolidated base for U.S. Forces Korea that is the largest overseas U.S. military installation in the world. Like Japan, South Korea is also procuring advanced U.S.-sourced systems, including four Global Hawks and 65 F-35s. However, in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, South Korea has trimmed its planned defense expenditures by approximately $738 million, or nearly 1.5 percent.
 But it is important to note that, apart from defense spending, arms purchases and contributions to host-nation support, Japan and South Korea are enormous contributors to U.S. power, influence and well-being. For example, Japan and the U.S. together promote the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy, helping regional states focus on sustainability in their development and support regional openness, fairness and transparency.
 Likewise, Japan and the U.S., together with India and Australia, form the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, focused on a shared commitment to preserving and promoting the rules-based order in the region. South Korea also stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the U.S., with its forces having fought alongside the U.S. in Vietnam and Iraq, and having spent decades training together in case hostilities with North Korea should resume. Additionally, South Korea has shipped the U.S. critical medical supplies that include 750,000 COVID-19 testing kits and 10,000 masks and bottles of hand sanitizer to Native American veterans of the Korean War, proving that a friend in need is a friend indeed.
 In a COVID-19 environment, it makes little sense for Washington to squeeze Seoul or Tokyo for marginal defense dollars — such a step would be pennywise but pound foolish, and even if the highest dollar amounts sought were actually achieved, the additional funds gained would total only about a percent and a half of the U.S. defense budget. This is not to say that these allies should not pay more; they should. As allies facing mutual shared adversaries with growing capabilities and an appetite for greater provocations, we share a responsibility to meet those challenges with new resolve and greater lines of effort. But the timing of any U.S. push to encourage these allies to do more needs to be reconsidered.
 These are not normal times. To proceed with SMA negotiations as if they are normal circumstances risks damage to long-term U.S. interests. What could help is a short-term solution, a stop-gap measure such as an agreement on South Korea’s recent offer of $1.3 billion per year in host-nation support, with a plan to revisit the issue again once the COVID-19 threat has passed. A similar short-term deal could be reached for Japan.
 U.S. alliances with Japan and South Korea are the foundations — “the cornerstone and the linchpin” as one recent report put it — of U.S. power and influence in the Indo-Pacific region. But COVID-19 has complicated any effort to hammer out new sustainable SMA deals. While SMA negotiations are critical to the long-term health of the alliances, pushing forward with them when Japan and South Korea — like the U.S. appear to be on the precipice of deep recessions amid an ongoing pandemic will not serve long-term U.S. interests. Doing so could result in political ill-will, reduced public support, and weakened alliances, all of which benefit U.S. adversaries.
 These allies are decades-long investments built on shared values and interests, as well as grassroots ties between people. Compromise could be possible, especially if it results in stronger alliances against a backdrop of growing challenges and common threats. At the end of the day, the great value the U.S. extracts from its alliances with Japan and South Korea is not the money they provide to offset the costs of hosting U.S. forces; the value is the deep and abiding alliances themselves and the liberal, democratic, rule of law market economies and societies to which they link the U.S.

Considered by many as the greatest all-around ballplayer in the game's history, along with Shea, Mays,too, is a regular at Giants home games. It was inevitable that the storyteller and the story would combine their talents.      24 - Life Stories and Lessons From The Say Hey Kid (www.stmartins.com) is the product of both Shea's writing expertise and Mays opening up his professional and personal life as he previously hasn't.      326 pages of baseball wow.

Sure, there is the 660 home runs, and "The Catch" made during Game 1 of the 1954 World Series at the Polo Grounds, and these subjects are two of many that Shea grabs details from Mays on in 24. But there is so much more addictive reading about Mays, the man, that makes this a must for all baseball fans.      24 offers fresh material on Mays, by Mays.      For Shea, during the process of gathering the material for 24, what would be planned for a two hour conversation at Mays' home, a short drive from Oracle Park, would morph into five hours. The access Shea received from Mays for 24 is indicative to how important this project is to "The Say Hey Kid."      " It (24) was 15 years in the making," says Shea during a recent telephone conversation. "I've been covering the Giants since 1988, and I'm from the Bay area. There is a trust factor with Willie."      Shea was persistent over the years in wanting to write a book about Mays, and wasn't shy in asking. Once Mays agreed, the two-time National League MVP wanted to steer the final product towards what would be read in classrooms. This is very important for Mays, and Shea nails it.      After Mays said "Let's get this done" (24), Shea agreed that anything that has been said in the past was off limits.      There's fresh material on the Giants-Milwaukee Braves 16-inning game in July 1963 won by Mays with a walk-off home run. Then, beginning on page 125, chapter 10, Mays goes into detail on his four home run game on April 30, 1961. The game with the Braves in Milwaukee is a story well worth waiting for.

How important is Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama to Mays, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1979? 24 spills the beans.      According to Shea's research, looking at Mays' career through modern analytics, he could have won seven, not two, MVP awards      " Willie contributing throughout (24) gives an up-to-date, comprehensive story of his life," Shea said.      Throughout the process of building 24, Shea tells of Mays being very engaged, and never got the "brush-off."      Mays' relationship with his father Cat Mays is highlighted in 24. A talented ballplayer in his own right, the love and confidence displayed to his son, as a single parent, demands an applause. Growing up in Fairfield (AL), teaching his son about the game, and watching him grow far beyond his years, beginning first as a bat boy, is part of the excitement of 24.      "The Catch."      With Shea transcribing Mays' memories of the 400 feet-plus shot hit by Cleveland's Vic Wertz in 1954 (Mays' first full big-league season), page 81 explains why there is another exciting part of this play that has never been given detail to, until 24.

How much did the winner and runner-up get compensated?

At 89-years-old, Shea says Mays has never gotten baseball out of him. He keeps busy with his Say Hey Foundation. Living about a 30-minute drive from Oracle Park in the same home home he purchased in 1970, Mays is a regular at Giants home games.      24 offers baseball history straight from the mouth of one of the greatest to ever lace up a pair of spikes. To hear how Mays overcame all the hardships standing before him, and never imagining baseball wasn't worth it, is nothing less than amazing.      Mays was anxious for 24 to be completed. Now, it's the public's time to be excited. 24 doesn't disappoint.
