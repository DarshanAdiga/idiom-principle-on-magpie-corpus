Furious Cardiff boss Neil Harris threatened his players with the axe after their 3-2 defeat at QPR
 Dom Ball’s brilliant stoppage-time strike won the game for Rangers after Harris’ side had fought back from 2-0 down.
 QPR scored twice in a one-sided first half and could have been further ahead by the interval.
 The Bluebirds’ display in that opening 45 minutes angered Harris, who said: “The first half was the worst in the time I’ve been in charge.
 “We were outfought, outrun and didn’t defend our penalty area. We can’t give teams head starts.
 “I’m here to win games of football and be successful as Cardiff City manager and I expect my players to have the same mentality.
 “We’ve got to bounce back. It’s their jobs. It’s what we’re asking from them.

Around the same time every year, Chelsea Ihle feels the same heavy weight in her chest.
 “It’s not like it’s all of a sudden it’s there and you feel it,” the Minneapolis resident said. “I think it’s something that slowly creeps up on you over time.”
 Sherri Holmen of Plymouth, Minnesota, has struggled every fall and winter for 15 years.
 “I overeat, oversleep, I stop visiting friends, I find it hard to get to work in the morning,” she said. “My concentration at work is much poorer.”
 Holmen and Ihle experience seasonal affective disorder, with the appropriate acronym SAD. And there are concerns the isolation and anxiety caused by the pandemic may intensify symptoms for many people.
 Craig Sawchuk from the Mayo Clinic, who researches seasonal affective disorder — also known as seasonal depression — described SAD as feeling “blah.”
 “When people start to talk about their mood they may not always report their mood is sad, like how we stereotypically think about depression — but more apathetic, more flat,” he said.
 It’s an annual battle for Madisyn Gowans of Minneapolis, too. She wonders what will happen as the pandemic continues.
 “People get sick left and right during the winter and we just brush it off as a cold — but now more than ever people are really taking it seriously and getting scared. So people are going to isolate more and they are going to be alone more,” she said.
 That’s a concern for Sawchuk. We’ve all had routines disrupted during the pandemic, and the researcher said those disruptions could make this winter more difficult for people with SAD.
 “We look at unhealthy habits that haven’t necessarily developed because suddenly it’s like, ‘I want to start drinking more and sleeping more.’ It’s just the way the environment and social rhythms have changed,” Sawchuk said.
 A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey from June showed about 30 percent of respondents feeling anxious or depressed due to the pandemic. That’s about three times more than the same time last year.
 But the experts — and Minnesotans who live with SAD — say there are ways to prepare. Like creating and following a schedule that designates a time for sleep, meals, exercise and self-care. Ihle said that provides her a welcome sense of familiarity.
 “What are the small things that you can make really predictable, that you know can have an incremental impact on just honestly making you feel better?” she said.
 Holmen said she monitors the early symptoms to get a jump start before her energy drops.
 “I would really encourage people to line up resources now that can be put in place, so when your tank is already low, it doesn’t just completely drop when we get to those months,” she said.
 Those resources may include a network of friends and family, and perhaps a professional.
 “If a person starts feeling melancholy, starts feeling extra blue, starts feeling like they’re not interested in their usual hobbies. (If) they’re not eating or drinking too much — those are all signs that they needed to reach out to a counselor or mental health professional,” said Irene Greene, a Minneapolis therapist and mental health educator.
 Greene teaches her patients to use the image of a donut to manage anxiety and depression.
 “The inner circle are the things I can do and I can influence, and the outer circle is what I cannot control or influence,” said Greene.
 The therapist said taking up activities such as growing indoor plants, reading, writing letters and painting can give a person something to look forward to each day. And she said it helps to remind ourselves what we’re thankful for.
 “Gratitude helps us feel more empowered — a sense of, ‘What do I have and feel good about and am grateful for?’ — helps us feel more empowered and off- balances the sense of powerlessness that COVID has collectively provided our world,” she said.
 Sawchuk from the Mayo Clinic recommends light therapy as an inexpensive and effective form of treatment. He says even just going for a daily walk, opening blinds or turning on lights can be a mood booster.
 Experts also recommend physical activity. Gowans said one of her go-to coping mechanisms lately is yoga.
 Holmen said she counts the hours of sunlight as a reminder that seasonal depression is just that — seasonal.
 “I feel much better substituting my cellphone scrolling with knitting,” Ihle said. “Colors, patterns and tactile feel of textures is something a little bit more soothing to focus on while doing activities like watching TV.”
 Ihle said there are simple steps we all can do to help each other in the months ahead.
 “Because so many more people are going to potentially go through that for the first time this winter,” she said, “just to be a little bit more patient, to be a little bit more kind, to be a little bit more understanding — that’s really the most that we can do for each other.”

“It’s their job to represent the club to the best of their ability and at the moment they’re not doing it.
 “I told the players in no uncertain terms where they’re at fault and who is at fault. I’ve never been so angry after a game.
 “I want to be successful and win games of football. If my players don’t do that then they won’t play.”
 After goals from Ilias Chair and Todd Kane put QPR in the driving seat, Joe Ralls pulled a goal back with a penalty early in the second half.
 Ralls followed to equalise after his second spot-kick was saved by goalkeeper Seny Dieng, but Ball’s brilliant goal gave Rangers the points.
 Harris, whose team have won just two of their opening nine league games, said: “I will praise my players for the second half, when they were outstanding, bossed the game and looked a real threat going forward.
 “People will say it (Ball’s goal) was a great goal but it summed us up. When the ball goes forward it gets in behind us and that’s not acceptable. I’m gutted.”
 QPR manager Mark Warburton was delighted with his team’s first win in eight matches but admitted they still have much to learn.

Swindon’s wretched league record looked like going from bad to worse when Lewis-Potter put Hull ahead in the 16th minute with a fine solo effort.
 Lewis-Potter started a jinking run from inside his own half before steering the ball into the far right corner past Matej Kovar.
 Caddis lashed the hosts level when Jonny Smith took a corner quickly which caught out the sleeping defence, with Caddis offered time and space to fire in off the bar in the 31st minute.
 Grant turned the game on its head in the 54th minute when a fine passing move by the Robins ended with Hallam Hope flicking the ball towards the winger who took his time and knocked it in for 2-1.
 Hull pushed hard for an equaliser but looked more likely to get caught on the counter and concede a third.
 Swindon assistant manager Noel Hunt, deputising for isolating boss Richie Wellens, said: “I thought the boys were fantastic today.
 “To go a goal down and show the character we showed and the goals that we scored were clever thinking.

 The forward took his goal tally to five in two games as the Gulls claimed a fifth consecutive victory, condemning Pools to their first defeat of the season.
 Wright sent Torquay into a 2-0 lead inside 14 minutes before another defensive error led to a third from Ben Whitfield, who fired home.
 Wright completed his hat-trick in the 57th minute, heading in Whitfield’s cross, and substitute Gary Warren’s tap-in made it 5-0 three minutes from time.

Playhouse On The Square Cancels Shows To January 2021 Amid COVID-19 Spike


--DocBreak--
_Kirsten Nelson._ At the foot of a giant, shiny condominium tower in downtown Dallas stands a shy, diminutive structure with a design far more complex than one would imagine upon first seeing it. From the street, the little building looks like a single story structure with some big windows. But once visitors step inside, they are suddenly basked in a soft, filtered version of daylight that illuminates objects and people evenly throughout the space. The first impulse is to glance upward toward a glass ceiling with an outer layer of roof panels designed to allow tamed light to enter only from the north.
 This is the Nasher Sculpture Center, designed by the revered architect Renzo Piano and built ten years ago. Indoors and outdoors, it houses a collection of greatest hits in sculpture. But about 18 months ago, as the Nasher's 42-story neighbor neared completion, the works at the museum were suddenly under threat. Sunlight reflecting off the tower's curved edifice had multiple negative effects. Viewers endured the painful glare of direct sunlight, art works were suddenly under fire, and the heat scalded plants in the garden outside.
 Now the museum and the ironically named Museum Tower are locked in a battle over who must rectify the situation. The museum insists that its specialized needs have been affected by the intrusion of this massive addition to the Dallas skyline, and therefore the condo structure should be altered to correct the light glare. Meanwhile, the tower's owners have indicated that the Nasher's demands are unreasonable and the museum should fix its own problem.
 The conflict is unlikely to be resolved any time soon, but it does resemble a debate within our own industry. Will the giant edifice of IT never bow to the unique requirements of AV? Well, new light was shed on the question at January's Integrated Systems Europe (ISE) show in Amsterdam. It seems that the big tower of IT is the one that customers tend to point toward whenever there's trouble with the comparatively little AV end points. So IT is realizing that the quality of the experience within the room requires the finesse of AV experts, and new partnerships are being formed. The conversation is just beginning, but it might just be that the big tower suddenly sees the stunning effects of the little building's careful design.

“It was very pleasing to get that early goal, that really settles you down, then we challenged the lads at half-time.
 “We were able to use our squad in the second half, and the depth in there, and to be honest they were a bit fortunate we didn’t go on to score three or four.”
 It had been a dramatic start to the game, with Fleetwood going ahead after only 45 seconds when Camps chested down then volleyed home superbly.
 Goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler was then the Town hero as he brilliantly saved James Henry’s penalty kick after Charlie Mulgrew had bundled over Matt Taylor.
 Oxford offered little after that moment, but it took until the 76th minute for Fleetwood to wrap up a well-deserved win when Paddy Madden smashed home clinically from 15 yards.
 Oxford boss Karl Robinson continues to rue a number of missing players through injuries.
 “I have no words after that,” said Robinson. “I won’t stand here and point the finger at anybody, though.
 “We go behind after 30 seconds or whatever it was, to a real wonder strike, but then we should have been level from the penalty.

 But manager Hodges already has an eye on Tuesday night as Wimbledon prepare to host Doncaster at their new stadium.

Planar Systems, Inc., a provider of digital display technology, has released 3D Building Information Modeling (BIM) models of select Planar large format LCD displays and video walls for free through the Autodesk Seek web service.
    Autodesk Seek allows architects, engineers and designers to easily find, preview and download 3D models of Planar displays. They can then incorporate these models into their building plans without having to create the models themselves. According to a report by McGraw-Hill Construction titled, "The Business Value of BIM in North America: Multi-Year Trend Analysis and User Ratings (2007-2012)," BIM adoption has grown 500 percent in the past years among AEC (Architect, Engineering, Construction) professionals and research indicates that up to 80 percent of firms have adopted BIM.
 "The BIM process has transformed design and construction with its ability to improve project 3D design and team collaboration," said Jennifer Davis, vice president of marketing for Planar Systems. "By offering our products as BIM ready objects, we make it easier for architects, engineers and designers to integrate Planar displays into their project designs right from the start."
 3D BIM models of three Planar product families are now available from the Autodesk Seek online content library, a web service that supplies free BIM models from a wide range of building product manufacturers. The models include Planar Mosaic architectural video walls, Clarity Matrix LCD video walls and Planar UltraLux Series large flat panel monitors. Each of these BIM models provides data-rich drawings and product specifications that accurately depict the displays and their options within Autodesk Revit, a 3D design platform.
 While Planar has provided 2D CAD drawings of its products for years, it was time-consuming for designers to turn these 2D drawings into accurate 3D objects. With the 3D BIM models available on Autodesk Seek, building professionals can now download these models and easily plug them right into their overall project designs, speeding up their work and improving the quality of their project models.
 "Building Information Modeling technology has quickly become the industry standard for accurately simulating buildings in 3D before they're constructed," said Rob Gaspard, AIA, principal of architectural firm WORKSBUREAU. "As a result, we have a growing need to integrate product data from manufacturers like Planar into our BIM designs. By putting 3D models of its displays on Autodesk Seek, Planar is not only miles ahead of the curve, but it's allowing me to offer enhanced decision making capabilities to my clients, making my job a whole lot easier."

 “I thought it was rubbish,” he said. “I thought the game was rubbish, but the conditions didn’t help it. We have got to manage the conditions better, I don’t think we did. We never won enough second balls, we never got in people’s faces, and to give away the two goals we did was criminal.
 “The second goal the ball has gone through the wall and then someone has to track the runner. Expect the unexpected.
 “I have said this week we have played well, had good spells in games. We didn’t play the percentages. It was never going to be pass the ball and move, intricate play, it was going to be about the ugly side of the game and we need to get back to that.
 “I don’t think we put their defence under pressure like they did to us first half.”

“We are all looking forward to getting there. It feels like home and we can’t wait to be in the heart of Wimbledon – we can’t wait to perform there.
 “We’ve been through a lot to get there and I’ve seen it come from being a Greyhound Stadium to being flattened so we are all really excited for Tuesday.
 “It will mean so much to the fans and everyone involved in the club.”
 Battles between the two Dons are often tetchy affairs but the absence of fans led to an understandable drop of intensity in Milton Keynes.

 Pigott went close to nodding the visitors back into the lead when he met Shane McLoughlin’s cross with a powerful header.
