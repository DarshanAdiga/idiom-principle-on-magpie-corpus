You’re driving down the road – and the person behind you hits the back of your car. You slam on your brakes and hit your head on the steering wheel. Getting out of the car, you check for damage. Your bumper is crushed and both tail lights are broken – and your neck hurts. Police are called to the scene. What now?
 According to Travis T. Mohler, trial attorney at Colombo Law in Columbus, and Dana Paris, partner at Nurenberg, Paris, Heller & McCarthy in Cleveland, the next step would be to seek a settlement from your insurance company.
 Settlements are pretty formulaic, but there are differences depending on the severity of the crash and the amount of damage.

FILE - In this June 9, 2020, file photo, a picture of a former American soldier is displayed at the former U.S. army Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin, Germany. In vowing to pull thousands of U.S. troops from Germany, President Donald Trump is following a pattern of disruptive moves against allies that have dismayed many of his fellow Republicans. Trump has consistently promised to bring American troops home, dismissing the conventional view that a far- flung U.S. military presence, while costly, pays off in the long run by ensuring stability for global trade. Earlier this week he said the 34,500 U.S. troops in Germany would be reduced to 25,000. less

“What adds to the strangeness of it all is this happens at a time when Hearts players are being asked to take wage cuts and defer pay.
 “How are the club going to justify going out and bringing in another manager? That’s what I would ask if I was a Hearts player just now.
 “It must be hard to stomach. If I put myself in the shoes of the Hearts boys yesterday morning I’d be far from happy to say the least.
 “It can’t work both ways. You can’t be asked to take a wage cut on one hand while spending that kind of money with the other.
 “If I was a player I’d be chapping a few doors and asking questions.”

“The process itself is the same, but the types of damages to which you’re entitled to are going to be different,” Paris noted. “If there is only property damage, you can claim the at-fault party’s insurance company to either repair your vehicle or total it out. If for whatever reason the at- fault party does have insurance and it’s just property damage, you can claim your coverage to get it fixed or total it out. If the injuries are physical, the extent of your damages is going to be very different. That could include medical costs, loss of wages, a loss of earning capacity and your non-economic damages, like pain and suffering.”
 While the professionals said they don’t purpose drag settlements out, there is no benefit to rushing to a conclusion, especially if there has been a degree of bodily injury. Paris suggested holding out until you know exactly how injured you are.
 “Scenario one is if a client makes a full recovery and all of their physicians believe they are back to baseline and have no ongoing issues, at that point I know there is a finite amount of medical bills, loss of wages and pain and suffering,” she said. “There is essentially a bookend, where their injuries stated and resolved. Scenario two is after all of their treatments, the client has not made a full recovery and doctors are telling me these are going to be chronic health issues. In other words, this is a permanent injury. That changes the negotiation paradigm dramatically.”
 Mohler added, “Also, the insurance company’s first offer is rarely the best. And when they say ‘take it or leave it,’ it’s almost always not true. We’re not trying to hit the lottery, but clients are deserving of a reasonable offer.”
 Should someone find themselves in this situation, contacting a lawyer for advice is not a bad place to start.
 “Reach out to an attorney and find out what your options are,” Paris said. “Because that is what is important, finding out what is available to them, especially if they have never experienced something like this.”
 Mohler added, “The first thing on your mind should not be a settlement or lawsuit. It should be, ‘Am I OK? Am I injured?’ You need to go to a doctor, listen to their advice. If you end up seriously injured, call a lawyer. The insurance company may be nice, but they are not your friend and their goal is always adverse to yours.”

"When you have been out for six months it is just getting that feeling back on the pitch. You can train as much as you want but being out here is totally different."Tomas Soucek's own goal had opened the scoring as West Ham remain precariously poised outside the relegation zone only on goal difference.But Hammers boss David Moyes was furious the opener was not ruled out for a handball by Davinson Sanchez as he flicked a corner into Soucek's path."I can't believe they have ruled that as a goal," said Moyes. "Who is on VAR tonight? He needs subbed I know that. That's the rules."Jose Mourinho's men were well worthy of a first win in eight games dating back to February.Victory takes Spurs to within six points of the top four and within one of Manchester United in fifth.Should Manchester City's appeal against a two-season ban from European competitions not prove successful, fifth would be good enough to qualify for the 2020/21 Champions League."I am happy with the result, the clean sheet, it means the team is more solid, the players have less doubts," said Mourinho. In keeping with many of the 14 games since the Premier League's restart seven days ago, this was another slow burner as Spurs took time to start picking holes in West Ham's rearguard.Son Heung-min thought he had broken the deadlock on the stroke of half-time with a smart finish at Lukasz Fabianski's near post, but the goal was ruled out for offside after a VAR review.Mourinho launched an impassioned defence of his record of working with world-class strikers on the eve of the game after criticism that his playing style could see Kane look for pastures new.And Kane had no shortage of opportunities after the break as his near post flick was turned behind by Fabianksi before he fired wide after sprinting the full length of the field as Spurs broke dangerously from a West Ham corner."He has been phenomenal in lockdown, he did amazing work at home and he is in the condition to help the team," added Mourinho. In between times, Pablo Fornals dragged wide West Ham's big chance to go in front and aid their battle to beat the drop.Moyes's men were undone by one of their own when Soucek unwittingly turned a corner into his own net 26 minutes from time.Jarrod Bowen smashed a shot against the post as the visitors suddenly had to alter their gameplan of containing Tottenham to look for an equaliser.But in doing so, they left themselves exposed at the back and Kane timed his run perfectly from a Son pass before coolly slotting past Fabianski and collapsing to the ground in a mixture of relief and exhaustion."I probably should have scored one other but it was nice to put that one away," added Kane."As a striker it's what you want to do. You want to score goals and want to help win the games."",

The chief executive of World Rugby believes the sport can at last get to grips with the longstanding problem of a global calendar, just days out from a seemingly key vote.
 Brett Gosper remains optimistic, despite a "frank" exchange of views at a meeting of the World Rugby professional game forum last week that broke up without an agreement.
 The sport had been in lockdown since March because of the coronavirus until New Zealand's in-house Super Rugby tournament started earlier this month.
 But the European season has yet to resume and, with several 2020 Six Nations matches still to take place, elite players face the prospect of a fixture pile-up later in a year blighted by COVID-19.
 Both the English Premiership and French league (LNR) voiced their disquiet over what they said was a "fait accompli" during last week's talks.
 However, Gosper, speaking ahead of a June 30 vote by World Rugby's council, which may now restrict itself to discussing the remainder of this year's programme, insisted that was not the case.
 "Our role is one of facilitating an outcome that is good for all and we are listening and understand the views of all stakeholders," he told AFP from Dublin.
 "It is important that the process recognises and supports the needs of both the clubs and the unions."
 The 61-year-old Australian insisted a compromise deal was possible.
 "While there appear to be some entrenched positions, there is a good understanding of the issues and a commitment to explore possibilities in much greater detail," he said.
 \- 'Meaningful games' -
 Gosper, in the post since 2012, said once there was an agreement covering the rest of this year, officials could then draw up a longer-term plan for re- aligning the calendar.
 He hoped that would lead to the November internationals being more than just one-off Tests, without them harming domestic club competitions.
 "Once we get some agreement on what the end of this year looks like, there will be deeper consultation to understand how we can achieve a more optimised long-term calendar than we currently have for the benefit of all –- unions and clubs," he said.
 "It would be a consultative process.
 "There would be more time to evaluate the options and reduce or remove overlaps between club and international competitions, giving a chance to build a narrative with more meaningful games across some form of competition in the November Test window."
 Gosper will hope his words will can placate the likes of LNR president Paul Goze, who has threatened to take action against World Rugby.
 The Frenchman claims the global governing body want to move the European season to the summer and reduce the number of fixtures, while at the same time expanding the November international window from three weeks to seven.
 France's Top 14 has the most expensive television broadcasting deal of any league in the world and the highest salary cap set at 11.3 million euros ($12.7 million) a season.

“It’s been really strange watching the English games without the supporters and the noise. But it’s something we are going to go with for now.
 “It’s a longer pre-season period so we are not rushing like we are in previous years. In some summer’s they only get a couple of weeks off.
 “But this time we can take a common sense approach to it and get quality work into them. Hopefully it will benefit us in terms of Europe.
 “The domestic season will hopefully have started and hopefully we’ll have a game or two under our belts by the time the qualifiers start.
 “We’ll need to plan it a week or so in advance and start looking at getting some matches at some stage. We want them to get used to playing behind closed doors so we might use the stadium for training a few times as well.
 “The preparations will be so important and we might look at going abroad to get games. It might be difficult playing down in England as we’d have to wait until their season is finished before we can even think about arranging games with them.

“One of the biggest negatives of that situation is that it costs money to transfer assets should you die without a will,” Sowald noted. “And you can’t exactly choose who gets what. I can’t think of any positives if someone dies without one, besides if there are disputes within the family and they don’t want to choose who gets up and leaving it up to probate.”
 Adel added, “Probate costs are higher, and it’s all public record and there is a significant time delay. The state is trying to give creditors time to get their bills in. By avoiding probate, you avoid all of that. There are also people in the law that you might not want to have a hand on your assets. You lose all of the flexibility within being able to distribute things without proper planning.”
 For families facing this situation, just be aware of how long it might take to get everything situated.
 “At the outset, it is going to take a bit more time to learn who the beneficiaries will be,” Gariepy explained. “When you have a will, you open it up and everything is in black and white. If you don’t have a will, there are those default rules. What else to expect is that it will be a bit more costly because now you have to go through probate. There is going to be some confusion, complexity and cost. It’s a bit more involved too since a will can really streamline the process.”
 Sowald added, “A lot of people will come to me and explain they don’t know what they have because it was never discussed. Just be aware that if there is a need for the property to be transferred, someone is going to have to go and get a court order to get those items. So, many people struggle to know where to even start. Also, be aware that you might also have other people making claims on assets in the event there is no will.”
 But the best way to start this process lies in contacting an estate planning attorney. Having them involved from the outset will help them guide you in the right direction.
 “We can help by creating a strategy in advance because fully disclosing everything to everyone is going to be better for efficiency purposes,” Adel said. “This is, unfortunately, a very emotional time and if you can rely on someone like me, you can let the emotional part be dealt with. The parts that will make the family uncomfortable, let that be handled by us.”

As we all know, shopping is so much fun when faced with huge selections of items you love. However, shopping can quickly have a negative effect if you are prone to spending too much. Let's take a close look at how to be financially responsible while shopping.
 Shopping Lists
 Shopping lists naturally help you to be financially responsible. Without a list, it's easy to be tempted by everything while in the store. You don't have anything on your agenda, so you're essentially buying at will. Soon enough, you've loaded up your cart with lots of things that you don't really need. With a shopping list, you know exactly which items you need when you enter the store. This helps you to make rational decisions instead of in the spur of the moment. Create the list at home when you are thinking critically about your finances. This will also help you to know which aisle of the store to go to. Without a list, you will have to walk through almost every aisle, which will only tempt you to buy more than is necessary.
 Online Shopping
 Online shopping is another fantastic approach. Not only are there more products to choose from online, but these stores have a number of unique features. Technology can help you save as much money when you checkout with your credit card. First, install an app such as Checkout Saver. Then, whenever you make a purchase online, it will automatically apply any eligible coupons and discounts. You hardly have to do a thing except select the item in the first place. Moreover, you receive cashback instantly upon each purchase. Some online shopping sites also allow you to bypass certain taxes due to the country of origin. When you factor in free shipping that is becoming so abundant, online retailers are excellent choices for financially minded shoppers. Most of these stores accept credit cards, debit cards and other payment services, so you have all your normal financial tools at your disposal.
 Gift Cards
 Finally, gift cards are other great options. When you buy discount gift cards, you're investing a certain sum of money to get back even more. It's essentially free cash. As long as you plan to shop at the store in the near future, there's really no reason to not opt for discount gift cards. In addition, gift cards give you a realistic limit of how much you can spend. As mentioned above, when you're armed with a credit card and no shopping list, it's very easy to go overboard with your purchases. With a gift card, you can't reach this limit of infinity without at least thinking twice about what you are doing. Because you acquired the gift card at a discounted price, you can feel good about your actions at the same time.
 Conclusion
 In conclusion, it's important to be financially responsible while shopping. Although your credit card may seem like an endless supply of money, it's really not. Choices you make now will come back to bite you later, so use your best discretion when making purchases.

 Police opened an inquiry at the time but the case was closed after a judge ruled it "accidental" death.
 However, CCTV footage of Tahiri's last moments in which he shows no signs of violence -- a requisite for authorities to resort to such a restraint -- was leaked to a Spanish newspaper.
 "If you see the video, you'll never believe it was accidental as the judge said," his brother Anass Tahiri, 22, told AFP.
 "The video shows how they killed him. It's murder," said Anass, whose family has lodged an official appeal against the case's dismissal.
 Published by El Pais, the footage emerged as global protests raged following the death of George Floyd in the US when a policeman knelt on his neck.
 The video's authenticity has been confirmed by a spokeswoman for Ginso, the private company managing Tierras de Oria.
 Within a week of its publication, the Spanish ombudsman's office called for the abolition of such procedures in juvenile detention centres.
 On June 18, the Almeria public prosecutor's office asked for the case to be reopened, denouncing as "illegal" the protocol for using such restraints.
 Tahiri's case centres on mechanical restraint -- strapping a person to a bed so they can't hurt themselves or anyone else -- but can only be used if they are agitated, aggressive or violent.
 \- 'Unnecessary aggression and violence' -
 In the video, six men roughly wrestle Tahiri on to a bed face down, at one point kneeling on his buttocks to tighten a strap around his waist, eventually realising he's no longer breathing.
 Tahiri, who arrived in Spain in 2017, was placed in juvenile detention over "some problems in the street", his brother told AFP.
 He had been at Tierras de Oria for two months when he died.
 The day before, the teenager was visited by his mother and told her he'd been subjected to threats and abuse, Anass recalled.
 "He wanted her to get a lawyer to get him out because he'd reached the point that he'd rather be in prison than in that centre," he said, adding that his brother had been on suicide watch.
 In a statement to AFP, Ginso said "the need for the restraint procedure was demonstrated (during the investigation) as was its correct application by staff who complied scrupulously with the protocol," saying its use was "exceptional" and only undertaken with the "minimum necessary force".
 But Andalusia's Human Rights Association (APDHA) says mechanical restraint is "standard practice" in juvenile centres, where it is often used for discipline or punishment.
 "What the video shows is a grossly disproportionate use of force given Iliass' attitude, involving completely unnecessary aggression and violence when he was restrained," APDHA's Francisco Fernandez Caparros told AFP.
 "Clearly his death occurred while they were applying the restraints... it was this situation of stress and violence that killed him," he said.
 Two other youngsters have died after being restrained: one in Madrid in 2011, and another in Spain's Melilla enclave in 2018.
 \- A swift reaction -
 Ombudsman Francisco Fernandez Marugan called on the government to change the law.
 "A swift and radical decision is needed that will end the use of mechanical restraints once and for all," he said.
 "Nobody else must die in these circumstances in Spain."
 The Almeria public prosecutor also ordered that all such restraints be "immediately" suspended.
 The restraint protocol puts youngsters "at serious unjustified risk", and where that results in injury, those responsible for approving such procedures will be held criminally liable, it said in a legal document.
 Contacted by AFP, the regional justice ministry declined to comment on the prosecutor's statement.
 But a spokeswoman said it would "respect and abide by" all judicial decisions.
 The closing of the Tahiri case "is currently being appealed," she said.
 \- No regional investigation -
 According to Andalusian opposition lawmaker Maribel Mora, the regional government did not hold an inquiry after Tahiri's death or check how the procedure was being used in centres under its jurisdiction.
 In 2016, the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture visited Tierras de Oria and denounced its restraint procedure as a "disproportionate use of force", urging regional governments to halt the practice, Mora told AFP.
 Despite the call, mechanical restraints were used 360 times in the region's 16 juvenile centres in the following two years, official figures show.
 "Whether or not they reopen the case, it is clear something is going very wrong and the (regional) government needs to respond and take responsibility for this," Mora said.

“While on the roadway, the crowd surrounded a State Trooper, who was alone and seated in his vehicle, and began rocking the vehicle, with the trooper having no safe means of egress,” said Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw in an initial statement, released on June 1, the day of the event.
 Several other public records also appear to contradict Outlaw’s statement, which drew immediate criticism from activists and civil rights groups.
 Although the state police released several hours of footage on Tuesday, only about 50 minutes are fully visible before the windshield is painted over. The portion of the video just before the gassing of demonstrators shows several troopers in a staging area on the highway, a few blocks west of the protest.
 The officers are seen donning SWAT gear and conversing, before an unidentified trooper pulls away in K1-15 and heads toward the protest. After battling gridlocked traffic in the eastbound lane of I-676, the trooper comes to a complete halt in a severe traffic jam just as the first scattering of protesters approaches.
 “All traffic is stopped. Repeat, they’re peaceful, just walking eastbound,” says an unidentified voice over the police radio, describing the protests.
 A Philadelphia bike patrol officer approaches the dashcam. The trooper exits his vehicle to speak with the officer just before the bulk of demonstrators approaches.
 “It’s just me right now, everything is shut down. I’m going to try to keep my long gun out of view,” the trooper says.
 Both men then appear to leave the vicinity of the SUV. In the following minutes, a mass of protesters slowly surround the empty vehicle. Aside from the spray-painted windshield, the vehicle appears to be otherwise undisturbed. No rocking is visible in the footage. Shortly afterward, screams can be heard as police begin to deploy tear gas canisters.
 About 10 minutes later, the trooper re-enters his vehicle.
 “I’m ready to go man, ready to f---ing move them,” says the trooper.
 In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Deana Gamble, spokeswoman for the mayor’s office, said the discrepancies between video footage and initial statements were merely the product of the commissioner “relaying information that she was provided at the time” in initial statements. She said the police Internal Affairs Division and an independent auditor were still investigating the incident.
 “This video will be included in that review, and so it would be premature to comment on it,” Gamble said.
 Although Kenney has defended the city’s use of tear gas as a “last resort” method to suppress unrest, he has asserted that he learned of the decision to fire canisters only after the confrontation. Last week, he said officers would be held accountable if investigations found that the Philadelphia Police Department commander on scene, who ordered the deployment, had acted prematurely.
 “We did not, and would never, pre-authorize or give police officers free rein to use any type of force against peaceful protesters exercising their constitutional rights,” he said. “If we discover that any officers used force inappropriately or without proper authorization, we will deal with it swiftly and accordingly.”
 State police spokesman Ryan Tarkowski insisted that the videos had been released unedited and “in their entirety in the interest of transparency.” However, approximately 42 minutes of footage leading up to the encounter with protesters has no attached audio. Though several other state police vehicles can be seen on the roadway in the clips, Tarkowski said footage from K1-15 was the only “recoverable” video of the incident.
 Tarkowski did not immediately respond to questions about the discrepancies.
 In an email, he said, “The department continues to review the incident.”
