The issue was revived during Francis’ 2019 summit on the Amazon. The region’s bishops called for the question of women deacons to be revisited given the shortage or priests in the vast territory. Francis agreed at the time, and the new commission appears to be his follow-up.
 Significantly, the scope of the commission's mandate does not appear to be limited to the early church, as was the 2016 commission. Amazonian bishops had called for the real-life experiences of their region's Catholic faithful to be taken into consideration in any new evaluation.
 Advocates for expanding the ministry to include women say doing so would give women greater say in the ministry and governance of the church, while also helping address priest shortages in several parts of the world.
 Opponents say allowing women to be deacons would become a slippery slope toward ordaining women to the priesthood. The Catholic Church reserves the priesthood for men, saying Christ chose only men as his 12 apostles. Francis has repeatedly reaffirmed the teaching.
 The new commission has as its president the archbishop of the central Italian city of L’Aquila, Cardinal Giuseppe Petrocchi. An official from the Holy See’s powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was named to serve as No. 2.

Il Real Madrid ha raggiunto un accordo con giocatori, staff tecnico e dirigenti sia della squadra di calcio che di pallacanestro per la riduzione degli stipendi. Di seguito, la nota della società spagnola: "I giocatori e gli allenatori delle prime squadre di calcio e pallacanestro del Real Madrid, guidate dai loro capitani, insieme ai dirigenti dei diversi settori del club hanno volontariamente deciso di abbassare la propria remunerazione per quest'anno tra il 10% e il 20%, a seconda delle circostanze che potrebbero influire sulla chiusura di questa stagione sportiva 2019-2020. Questa decisione, adottata da giocatori, allenatori e dipendenti, evita misure traumatiche che colpiscono il resto dei lavoratori, oltre a contribuire agli obiettivi economici dell'entità in vista della diminuzione del reddito che subisce in questi mesi a causa della sospensione delle competizioni e la paralisi di gran parte delle sue attività commerciali. Il comitato aziendale del club sostiene fermamente questa decisione, che considera responsabile ed esemplare. Il Real Madrid è orgoglioso di tutti coloro che compongono questa grande famiglia e della sua cultura incrollabile di valori, che diventa particolarmente preziosa in tempi di difficoltà come quella attuale. Allo stesso modo, il Real Madrid, i suoi partner e i suoi tifosi vogliono estendere tutto il loro amore e la loro solidarietà a coloro che hanno subito le conseguenze dirette di questa malattia che ci sta colpendo, specialmente quelli che hanno perso un membro della famiglia o qualcuno che amano. Il club augura una pronta guarigione a tutti i malati e vuole esprimere il suo più profondo ringraziamento a tutti coloro che svolgono un ruolo essenziale, esemplare e di supporto nella lotta contro il COVID-19. Dal Real Madrid, tutto il nostro sostegno e la nostra forza nella convinzione che insieme supereremo senza dubbio questo momento difficile".

My dog is squirrel obsessed.      This is not as much of an issue now that we moved to the city, but it was a big problem when we lived in the suburbs where there were a kajillion squirrels. I had to imagine he was genetically wired for this because he did not have any kind of traumatic squirrel experience as a puppy that would cause him to have a squirrel vendetta. Of course they may have ganged up on him when I wasn't looking and pelted him with acorns or something just for laughs, and I never knew about it. He was actually traumatized by a giant woodchuck that lived under our deck years ago, so maybe he thought all squirrels were small woodchucks and this was his way of working through his issues. This was not such a stretch considering the first time I saw the woodchuck, I thought it was a beaver. Maybe wildlife idiocy runs in the family.      Whatever the reason, the dog was clearly not a fan of squirrels and would sit by the deck door watching the backyard like some kind of squirrel mercenary. Neither sleep nor hunger would tear him from his post unless of course he needed a nap or heard the sound of food accidentally dropping on the kitchen floor. When a squirrel appeared, he would growl menacingly and finally erupt into a fit of hysterical barking until I let him outside to chase the man- eating squirrel over the fence or up a tree.      This happened ... no kidding ... every five minutes.      Like I said, there were a lot of squirrels out there.      In the city, however, there were not that many squirrels around, so the dog took to hating pigeons instead. I have to admit, I was kind of with him on that. At least the squirrels didn't poop on your head from above.      Unbeknownst to me, though, the pigeon thing had the potential to be an even bigger problem. In the suburbs, I could just let the dog run wild in our backyard to chase squirrels. (He never caught any, but I think it was just the thrill of the chase). But in the city, the dog was on a leash. And I didn't learn about his pigeon obsession until I had him out for a walk. As we strolled down the street, we came across a flock of pigeons just hanging out on the sidewalk, doing their pigeony things.      When the dog saw them, he lost his mind.      He lurched after the pigeons, dragging me behind him like a piece of toilet paper on the bottom of your shoe. And then the pigeons did something that squirrels don't do. They flew. Thinking he could follow them, the dog flew, too … for one second. Just long enough for me to also fly … into a tree.      Had I not gone face first into a tree, I might have been impressed that:   a) the dog thought he could fly,   b) all the pigeons got away, and   c) my face found one of only three trees on the whole street.      As I sat in the dirt next to the tree, the dog came over to me. He did not try to comfort me or come to my assistance in any way. Instead, he looked at the tree with some obvious interest.      I shook my head at him.      "Don't even think about it!"   You can follow Tracy on Twitter @TracyBeckerman and become a fan on Facebook at www.facebook.com/LostinSuburbiaFanPage.

Leftist US Senator Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign Wednesday, clearing the way for rival Joe Biden to secure the Democratic nomination and challenge Donald Trump in November.
 The feisty 78-year-old democratic socialist shook up the 2020 race with his relentless pursuit of "economic justice" for all Americans and a demand for universal health care.
 But he acknowledged his campaign fell short, as party voters determined Biden would be a stronger candidate to go up against Trump in the general election.
 "I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will not be successful," Sanders told supporters in a livestream from his home, where he has remained for the bulk of the coronavirus pandemic that put all in-person campaigning on hold.
 "Vice president Biden will be the nominee," he said, adding that he congratulated Biden, "a very decent man, who I will work with to move our progressive ideas forward."
 Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the party's nomination in 2016, mounted a formidable 2020 bid.
 He raised astonishing amounts of money from record numbers of donors, becoming the frontrunner early this year and earning the most votes in the first three state-wide contests.
 But he was eclipsed by a surging Biden, who won the vast majority of remaining primaries and now holds a commanding lead in the all-important race for delegates who choose the nominee.
 Sanders brought his liberal ideological platform -- including a call for universal health care and a $15 hourly minimum wage -- into the mainstream.
 "Together we have transformed American consciousness as to what kind of nation we can become, and have taken this country a major step forward in the never- ending struggle for economic justice," Sanders said.
 Several US lawmakers have come out in support of his policies, and Biden has shifted leftward to incorporate some Sanders positions, although he does not support Sanders's Medicare for All plan.
 \- Biden seeks party unity -
 Biden immediately hailed Sanders as "a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country."
 He urged Sanders supporters to join his campaign, which already has the backing of nearly all other ex-rivals in the race including senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, and former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg.
 "I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country," Biden said in a statement to Sanders and his supporters.
 "I hope you will join us. You are more than welcome. You're needed."
 Trump made his own pitch for Sanders's supporters, though in a more abrasive tone.
 "Bernie Sanders is OUT!" the president posted on Twitter, saying Senator Elizabeth Warren helped split the liberal vote by remaining in the race during key contests, thereby helping Biden, the Democratic establishment's clear choice for the nomination.
 "The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!" Trump said.
 Trump won the 2016 election with help from disaffected working-class voters who believed they were being left behind by politicians in Washington.
 Sanders also appeals to those voters.
 On Wednesday he warned the coronavirus was causing an "economic meltdown" that has resulted in millions of lost jobs and a scramble for many to regain access to health insurance.
 Sanders said he would not remain in an unwinnable campaign that would "interfere" with important anti-coronavirus work while the country is gripped by crisis.
 But he stressed he would remain on the ballot and seek to gain as many delegates as possible in order to "exert significant influence" over the direction of the party.

 As the grieving mother told Hawaii News Now, she's choosing to focus on the positives rather than the negatives -- like the fact her daughter did find happiness during her short time on Earth.

 "It was frustrating how others can be so, so reckless and be fine but we were so careful and we got it," she adds.  
 In the end, the mom has a message to anyone who thinks it's fine to run out for a walk or errand that isn't necessary.
 "PLEASE STAY HOME!" she wrote on Facebook. "The government needs to be more strict!"
 She ended her post with some meaningful food for thought.
 "Is it really worth your life or anyone else’s life for the sake of a walk or a run?" she asked. "Or even a trip out in the car?"  
 We think most people would agree that it's really not.

Passersby on Route 231 may have noticed heavy machinery and construction- related activity less than a mile west of Serenity Farm in Charles County.
 A road is in the process of being built, Charles County Planning Director Jason Groth said. The road — which runs north from 231 at its junction with Tanyard Place — will be used to access the 19-lot Grace Landing subdivision, Groth said.
 A preliminary subdivision plan was approved in June 2015 and lots were recorded in February 2018.
 The developer, Drew Havrilla’s J.C. Drew Homes, plans to build homes on 18 1-acre lots and one 25-acre lot that has agricultural use, county planner Ben Yeckley said.
 The 62.4-acre site is slated to have 12.6 acres of open space, according to Groth.
 No building permits have been applied for yet at the site, 7000 Tanyard Place, Yeckley said, but Havrilla said four homes are under contract.
 Havrilla said he personally designs the custom-build homes and has around 12 designs available. “It literally comes down to whatever the customer wants,” he said.
 “We still have customers in spite of all this,” he said, referring to the impact of COVID-19.
 Havrilla said he was planning to show lots to another potential customer on Friday.
 “We anticipate paving in the next 30 to 60 days,” he said, referring to the road to be known as Grace Landing Court, which will be named after his twin 8-year-old daughters, Elle and Ayla, who both have Grace as a middle name.
 The coronavirus hasn’t stopped his home-building, Havrilla said, noting that his company is currently building two homes at Lord Creek, 7320 Field O’Mary Place in Hughesville.
 “We’re working around it,” he said of social distancing requirements, noting that only one person is working at each house at a time. “We find it very comforting that we still have customers coming out.”
 Havrilla purchased the land five years ago and said that by the time Charles County got done re-engineering it, he couldn’t afford to hire an excavation company to build the road.
 “So I and a friend (Tommy Jones) ended up building the road,” he said, which has taken 18 months.
 “You are blessed sometimes when you get stuck in a situation and people come to your aid and help you out,” he said, noting that Joe Husic of Husic Construction lent Havrilla some equipment to build the road.
 Havrilla has been building homes since 1994 in Southern Maryland, including Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s counties.
 He started J.C. Drew Homes in 2008 when he was building homes in Quicktree Farm, which is just west of Grace Landing.
 He built 16 of the 17 homes in that subdivision, he said.
 Havrilla said he’s built eight homes in Calvert County, including four of the six in The Orchard in Huntingtown.
 “By going over there (to Calvert), I remembered what I love about building,” he said. “I can’t say enough good things about Calvert County,” referring to the planning department specifically.

The departure of Sanders, the last remaining rival to Biden, sets up a race between the former vice-president and Trump, who is seeking a second four-year term in office. Sanders’ decision comes as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic that up-ended the nominating schedule, with some primaries postponed and others up in the air.

Three decades later, in both his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, Sanders continued with that theme. In 2016, he released his Medicare for All plan by declaring, "It is time for our country to join every other major industrialized nation on Earth and guarantee health care to all citizens as a right, not a privilege." His 2020 campaign website further echoed this sentiment, stating that "the United States will join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right."

The Trustees of Reservations will reopen more than 70 of its properties around the state Thursday just two weeks after it closed all 118 of its farms, trails and wildlife reservations to the public.
 "Now more than ever, we recognize that offering access to our special places provides respite, solace, fresh air, and a physical outlet during this unprecedented time in our world," Trustees President & CEO Barbara Erickson said in a statement.
 The properties to reopen include the Holmes Reservation in Plymouth, Governor Hutchinson's Field and Pierce Reservation in Milton, Moose Hill Farm in Sharon, Signal Hill in Canton and the Governor Oliver Ames Estate in Easton.

 The Trustees first announced the closures on March 24, citing Gov. Charlie Baker's stay-at-home advisory as the guiding force behind the decision. The initial closure order said the properties would stay closed through at least April 7.
 In the time since, the Trustees say they've been working with local and state officials to determine how to open some of the properties for the public's use while keeping staff and visitors safe. The 76 properties set to reopen are those that do not require staffing in order to open and which did not experience overcrowding prior to the closures.
 In its announcement, the group encouraged any potential visitors to only visit their local outdoor destinations and not travel to places outside their communities.
 "We know that it is so important that visitors follow the CDC social distancing guidelines for everyone's safety and that they stay close to home," Erickson said.
 All properties that require staff presence or where town officials have requested they stay closed will be shuttered through May 4. Sites with narrow trail systems were also kept closed and Trustee farms will remain closed, except for curbside food pickup.
 The group's announcement said it hopes to be able to reopen all properties eventually, with a plan for controlled access.
 The Trustees are not the only group struggling with how to keep outdoor spaces open in a safe way.
 Mass Audubon also closed its properties the week of March 23, and has not signaled any plans to reopen. All scheduled programs have been canceled through April 30.
 "We understand that our decision to temporarily close our trails is disappointing to our members and supporters . . . And it is not a decision we took lightly," the organization said on its website. "We want nothing more than to reopen our trails. And the moment we feel it is safe to do so we will."

A drone soon will be screening visitors to the Daytona Beach Police Department, checking to see if they have a fever as efforts continue to combat COVID-19, officials said on Tuesday.
   
 Others will fly around the city, watching for groups and warning them about the coronavirus.
   
 The drone that can check for fevers, which was bought with seized drug money at a cost of $26,000, is equipped with a digital camera and a heat detecting device, FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared). The machine will be placed for now in the lobby of the police department, said police Sgt. Tim Ehrenkaufer, who heads the department's Unmanned Aviation Systems Unit.
   
 The drone equipped with FLIR will be able to read people's temperatures from a distance of 300 to 400 feet, said Messod Bendayan, police spokesman.
   
 Using shades of color, the drone with FLIR can pick out a person with fever in a crowd, the sergeant said.
   
 "If I zoom in on a crowd of people and somebody in there had a ... everybody was 98.6 degrees, or whatever the new normal is 97, and somebody has a 102 fever, he would be red in a crowd of orange people," Ehrenfauker said.
   
 This would alert police and first responders to make sure to take extra precautions and have the extra equipment needed to handle the situation, the sergeant said.
   
 The drone also has the capability of dropping off medication, gloves, or a cellphone in a hostage situation -- places that may not be easily or safely accessed by police officers, officials aid.

 The heat-detecting drone is one of two types Daytona police are now using to aid in preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 The department also has two Mavic 2 Enterprise model drones that will leave the office. Each valued at $3,000, they're on loan from DJI Enterprise, a China-headquartered drone manufacturing company with operations in California. The equipment agreement is under the manufacturer's U.S. Disaster Relief Program, Bendayan said.

 The drones come with a speaker, a spotlight, a strobe light and battery, Ehrenkaufer said. They will be deployed to inform people who may be out in violation of Gov. Ron DeSantis' Safer-At-Home order, Ehrenkaufer said.
   
 With more than 30 missions flown over closed parks and city properties over the last weekend, police have discovered that people have been compliant with the drone's announcements, Ehrenkaufer said.
   
 "We're flying them over, making the announcement. They look up at the drone, startled for a second that they are hearing somebody from the air talking to them, they then wave to it, leave the property and every thing is good," Ehrenkaufer said. "(Police have seen) not just compliance but nobody seems to be upset with it either."
   
 In the wake of coronavirus, the drone program will be a key tool, Ehrenkaufer said.
   
 "I think its really important right now because we are starting to run into situations where we can only do so much without having to come face to face with people that may or may not have the virus," the sergeant said. "In terms of keeping officers safe, I think it's very important."

Lobo Stadium was closed briefly Wednesday morning, but Longview ISD officials then reversed course and said that the stadium will remain open while officials monitor the situation.
 Longview ISD closed access to the stadium in a release before then stating that they will monitor the situation and make a determination in the coming days.
 "There are quite a few people in the community that are using the stadium in the proper way," Longview ISD trustee Chris Mack said. "There are groups of kids that are playing on the field, which we cannot allow, so we're going to try to police it for a couple of days.
 "If that does not work, then we will have to shut it down."
 Mack said that there are signs in place at entrances to the stadium urging residents to practice proper social distancing guidelines while exercising. He said that staff at the campus will monitor the situation but ultimately it will come down to the public abiding by the guidelines.
 "Hopefully the signs will do the trick," Mack said. "Hopefully they'll read the sign, respect what we're trying to do at this point and we won't have to punish the whole community.
 "We'll have to see how it goes. We're not going to be real patient, and we're not going to give it a long time — a day or two maximum. This is a chance for the public to use common sense like they're doing everywhere else."
 Elsewhere in town, Pine Tree assistant athletic director Kerry Lane said that Pine Tree's facilities are closed. Pirate Stadium has never been open to the public and the old Pirate Stadium on Pine Tree Road has been locked.

Louis Vuitton is converting five of its French worshops to make masks for frontline health workers, the luxury brand said Wednesday.
 Its chairman Michael Burke praised employees who had volunteered to make the non-surgical masks with France hit -- like several other countries -- by shortages of protective facing coverings.
 He said hundreds of thousands of masks would be produced in the workshops which usually turn out designer clothes and luxury leather goods.
 Dior, which is also owned by LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods group, has been making masks since the end of last month for hospital staff.
 It said that seamstresses who usually work on couture creations had volunteered to go back to its ateliers in Redon in Brittany in western France, which has been closed since France when into lockdown on March 17.
 "In an exceptional show of solidarity, our wonderful petites mains (or "little hands", as those who make luxury clothes are called) are working tirelessly" to protect health workers, the label said.
 A number of fashion labels have also been making masks for free, with designers also sharing their DIY patterns online.
 LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, the world's second richest man after Amazon's Jeff Bezos, last month ordered his perfumeries that usually make fragrances for Dior, Guerlain and Givenchy to switch production to hydroalcoholic gel hand sanitiser.
 The gel was then distributed free to French hospitals. LVMH said they would make as much of the gels "as was needed... and honour the commitment as long as necessary."

County cricketers will take "maximum reductions" in their salaries during April and May and have agreed to waive £1 million ($1.25 million) in prize money during the coronavirus crisis, the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) announced on Wednesday.
 The county championship, comprising four-day matches, was due to start on Sunday but English cricket is shut down until at least May 28, with the expectation of further postponements.
 The PCA on Wednesday welcomed the collective player agreement, which covers an initial period of April and May.
 "Discussions between the PCA, ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) and 18 first-class counties reached a conclusion today with all parties supporting an initial two-month agreement that will see maximum reductions to player salaries and relinquishing of domestic prize money," the PCA said in a statement.
 The PCA has relinquished £1 million of the domestic player prize money for 2020 and players will also agree to be furloughed if asked to by their county.
 Champions Essex confirmed that the club's playing staff, along with most non- playing staff, had been placed on furlough.
 A number of other clubs including Yorkshire and Worcestershire had previously confirmed they would be using the government's job retention scheme.
 PCA chairman Daryl Mitchell said: "The coronavirus pandemic will continue to put financial pressure on the game and this initial two-month agreement will support the game for the period of April and May.
 "We were due to start the county championship season on Sunday and sadly for us all that will not be the case. As a group of players, we will do everything we can to ensure that when cricket does return the sport is in a position to thrive."
 The ECB last week announced a £61 million aid package in response to the "once-in-a-generation" challenge.

"
 My dog is squirrel obsessed.
 This is not as much of an issue now that we moved to the city, but it was a big problem when we lived in the suburbs where there were a kajillion squirrels. I had to imagine he was genetically wired for this because he did not have any kind of traumatic squirrel experience as a puppy that would cause him to have a squirrel vendetta. Of course they may have ganged up on him when I wasn't looking and pelted him with acorns or something just for laughs, and I never knew about it. He was actually traumatized by a giant woodchuck that lived under our deck years ago, so maybe he thought all squirrels were small woodchucks and this was his way of working through his issues. This was not such a stretch considering the first time I saw the woodchuck, I thought it was a beaver. Maybe wildlife idiocy runs in the family.
 Whatever the reason, the dog was clearly not a fan of squirrels and would sit by the deck door watching the backyard like some kind of squirrel mercenary. Neither sleep nor hunger would tear him from his post unless of course he needed a nap or heard the sound of food accidentally dropping on the kitchen floor. When a squirrel appeared, he would growl menacingly and finally erupt into a fit of hysterical barking until I let him outside to chase the man- eating squirrel over the fence or up a tree.
 This happened ... no kidding ... every five minutes.
 Like I said, there were a lot of squirrels out there.
 In the city, however, there were not that many squirrels around, so the dog took to hating pigeons instead. I have to admit, I was kind of with him on that. At least the squirrels didn't poop on your head from above.
 Unbeknownst to me, though, the pigeon thing had the potential to be an even bigger problem. In the suburbs, I could just let the dog run wild in our backyard to chase squirrels. (He never caught any, but I think it was just the thrill of the chase). But in the city, the dog was on a leash. And I didn't learn about his pigeon obsession until I had him out for a walk. As we strolled down the street, we came across a flock of pigeons just hanging out on the sidewalk, doing their pigeony things.
 When the dog saw them, he lost his mind.
 He lurched after the pigeons, dragging me behind him like a piece of toilet paper on the bottom of your shoe. And then the pigeons did something that squirrels don't do. They flew. Thinking he could follow them, the dog flew, too ... for one second. Just long enough for me to also fly ... into a tree.
 Had I not gone face first into a tree, I might have been impressed that:   a) the dog thought he could fly,   b) all the pigeons got away, and   c) my face found one of only three trees on the whole street.
 As I sat in the dirt next to the tree, the dog came over to me. He did not try to comfort me or come to my assistance in any way. Instead, he looked at the tree with some obvious interest.
 I shook my head at him.

Wells Fargo also posted higher litigation accruals, to the tune of $1.5 billion. Bulls may argue that the balance sheet cleanup with the write-down sets a bottom from here. The new CEO is at the beginning phases of orchestrating a turnaround. At a price-to-earnings ratio below 8 times and a dividend that yields over 7%, value investors may speculate by buying WFC stock here.

Landrieu is harshly critical of Trump for downplaying the virus's threat earlier this year and for lashing out at governors who criticize his handling of the pandemic. Landrieu said Edwards “has done a great job of trying to keep his powder dry with the president under difficult circumstances” while keeping all state officials, Republican and Democrat, “in the loop because you're one team.”

Things are going to get worse before they get better, that much is clear. How much worse and when is a tougher question to answer.
 So it should come as no surprise that this week, like the one before it, the state was focused on preparing for both the known and unknown.
 As Congressional lawmakers attempted to explain how a historic $2 trillion stimulus would help Massachusetts, talks were underway for a fourth federal relief package, state lawmakers were exploring how they could chip in, and the state was building a volunteer force of medical professionals that by Monday was already 1,800 people strong.
 Gov. Charlie Baker also made the call to extend his executive order closing all non-essential businesses for at least another month, telling businesses to prepare to be shuttered through at least May 4.
 Thursday was supposed to be Opening Day at Fenway Park, but the only talk of fields had to do with the hospitals the state was scrambling to set up in time for the surge in infections on its way, and the only sports franchise generating headlines was getting its attention for a covert mission to China to secure 1.2 million masks.
 But enough, already. Let's go to the tape.
 A day after visiting the DCU Center in Worcester as it was being set up as a field hospital to accept COVID-19 patients, Gov. Charlie Baker was back at the State House on Thursday and finally ready to share his public health team's best estimates for when the virus will peak in Massachusetts.
 Baker said the surge was now projected to arrive between April 10 and April 20, and as many as 172,000 people could ultimately become infected. Of course, that was the high end of what turned out to be an extremely broad range that could be as low as 47,000 infections if social distancing goes well over the next few weeks.
 That was the bad news.
 The good news, if you can call it that, is that using models based on what happened in Wuhan, China, Baker said that the state's current fatality rate of 1.5 percent is on track to remain lower than some other states and parts of the world, in part because of lower population density and smoking rates and earlier action to keep people home.
 "We know all models are not perfect, but obviously you need to plan for the worst and at the end of the day hope you do not need to go that far," the governor said.
 To meet the surge demand, Baker said the state needs to add 500 intensive care beds and an untold number of acute-care beds for less severe infections.
 Which circles back to the DCU Center, where three trucks full of supplies showed up this week to turn the hockey, concert and convention venue into a 250-bed field hospital to accept overflow from UMass Memorial Medical Center.
 The Boston Convention and Exhibition Center is being looked at as a second field hospital for both the homeless and COVID-19 patients, and Baker said Joint Base Cape Cod and the MassMutual Center were also on the radar to locate additional acute care beds.
 Hospitals are also working to maximize their own physical footprints, and at least two nursing homes so far - Beaumont in Worcester and AdviniaCare in Wilmington - are being emptied to accept coronavirus patients.
 In that process, at least one patient at Beaumont tested positive for COVID-19 and was kept at the facility so as not to carry the disease to another nursing facility.
 Some local communities, like the city of New Bedford, are going further to prevent the coronavirus from infiltrating senior care facilities. On the opening day of scallop season, New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell said he would start requiring twice-daily temperature checks of all staff, and regular screenings for residents.
 Mitchell was trying to prevent the type of outbreak that led to the death of 21 residents of the Holyoke Soldiers' Home. All told, 59 residents of the home have been diagnosed with COVID-19.
 Amid suggestions from Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse and others that the superintendent of the Holyoke veterans' home Bennett Walsh concealed the outbreak until it was too late, Baker put Walsh on leave, and brought on former federal prosecutor Mark Pearlstein of McDermott Will & Emory to conduct an investigation.
 "We will get to the bottom of what happened and when and by who," Baker said.
 On a more uplifting note, the Wall Street Journal on Thursday morning detailed the who, what and when of a complex, back-channel humanitarian mission that involved the governor, Robert Kraft, the Boeing 767 that doubles as the New England Patriots' team plane, and a tight three-hour window on a tarmac in China to bring over a million medical masks back to Boston.
 The successful delivery of personal protective equipment came after an order of 3 million masks from BJs got confiscated in the port of New York. Instead of trying traditional channels again, Baker found a partner in the Krafts to help transport masks directly from China, getting help from the Chinese embassy, the State Department and the governor of Alaska along the way.
 The Patriots were back in the picture a day later when it was announced that Gillette Stadium would become the site of a drive-thru testing center for first responders - another positive story for the team that didn't involve Tom Brady moving into Derek Jeter's Tampa manse.
 For those who don't live in mansions, the House on Thursday passed legislation to put a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, lasting 30 days beyond the end of the state of emergency. The House also passed a bill that would let the commissioner of education waive or modify MCAS testing requirements for seniors hoping to graduate this spring, while the Senate tackled an expansion of unemployment benefits.
 While the two Democrat-led chambers work to get on the same page on those three bills, the Legislature did finally strike a deal on a municipal governance bill that was signed by Gov. Baker Friday giving towns some flexibility in their deadlines to deal with permits, budgets and other government functions.
 The bill also extended the personal income tax filing deadline to July 15, and gave restaurants doing take-out business permission to sell beer and wine to go.
 With restaurant operation severely cut back, celebrity Boston chef Tiffani Faison had time one night this week to go on the Joseph Kennedy III nightly webcast to cook some chicken and talk about coronavirus.
 Kennedy has largely suspended his campaign during the pandemic, but he did manage to outraise incumbent Sen. Ed Markey in the first quarter of 2020, pulling in $1.95 million in donations and starting the second quarter with $6.2 million in the bank to Markey's $4.4 million.
 Markey, however, scored a win of his own when the Democratic Party decided to cancel its May 30 nominating convention in Lowell, with the blessing of both Markey and Kennedy's campaigns.
 As part of that decision, Kennedy conceded the party endorsement to Markey, who all agreed was likely to prevail based on the delegates elected so far.

The coronavirus pandemic has crippled the U.S. legal system, creating constitutional dilemmas as the accused miss their days in court. The public health crisis could build a legal backlog that overwhelms courts across the country, leaving some defendants behind bars longer, and forcing prosecutors to decide which cases to pursue and which to let slide.

Donations are being raised via a GoFundMe for distribution to two organizations supporting the industry’s crew members, the Motion Picture & Television Fund (MPTF) and The Actors Fund. The announcement noted that the MPTF and The Actors Fund are working in tandem applying the same eligibility requirements and dispensing the same amount of money – generally $1,000 for an individual and potentially higher for families – and coordinating to ensure people only apply to one of the funds.
