"I got used to wearing extensions, really just over the last decade. All different kinds, tried them all, the ones that are glued on, the tape-ins, the clip ins, and then into a total hair system that I hated, and finally to a unique solution that really did work pretty well for me for the last 4 or 5 years. I tried wigs on a few occasions but never could get used to them. It all felt fake and I was super self-conscious and uncomfortable," she said.

Gallagher, a lawyer, is former president and chief executive officer of Community Foundations of the Hudson Valley, a position she resigned from to run for comptroller. Gallagher previously was chief strategy officer for Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress, deputy planning director and director of business services for Ulster County, and chairwoman of the Ulster County Industrial Development Agency.
 She also worked for Maurice Hinchey when he was a state assemblyman, before being elected to Congress.
 Gallagher's term runs through Dec. 31, 2021, which would have been the end of Auerbach's term. The position will be on the ballot in November 2021, and the winner will serve a four-year term starting Jan. 1, 2022.

Voters in Virginia, where Western democracy began 400 years ago, have always been pretty good about going to the polls every four years, when there's a presidential contest on the ballot. About 70 percent of the state's voters show up for that.
 But turnout has tended to plummet - to 30 or 40 percent - in the off years, when it's time to pick a governor and other statewide officials, members of Congress, or state legislators.
 Trump seems to have disrupted that pattern. Voters who love or loathe the president have gone to the polls in record numbers to register their support or opposition.
 The year after Barack Obama won the White House, 40 percent of Virginia voters cast ballots in the 2009 governor's race, won by Republican Robert McDonnell. In 2013, a year after Obama won a second term, 43 percent of voters participated in elections that put Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Executive Mansion.
 Yet turnout was 48 percent in 2017, a year after Trump's election, when Democrat Ralph Northam won the governorship over Republican Ed Gillespie.
 Forty-four percent of voters cast ballots in congressional elections in 2010. And 42 percent did so in 2014, for congressional contests and a nail-biter between Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat, and Gillespie. But turnout spiked to 60 percent for congressional races in 2018.
 Turnout traditionally hits its nadir the year before presidential elections, when every seat in the Virginia House of Delegates and Senate is on the ballot, without any statewide or federal contests. Those "off-off year" elections drew about 29 percent of voters in 2011 and 2015.

The city’s Community Risk Reduction Division is reminding business owners that they won’t get a bill for their business license and fees are due beginning Thursday.
 Implementation of the city business license ordinance started in October last year. Still, Fire Department Lt. Jeremy Sansing said less than a quarter of businesses in the city had obtained a business license by the end of 2019.
 Division Chief Clint Nichols said division members will be going to businesses to inspect them as part of the department’s effort to maintain the ISO rating of 2, which was lowered from 3 last year. Insurance companies can use information from the rating to set home and business insurance premiums and they could be lower. He said owners should check with their insurance companies to make sure they know about the lowered ISO rating.
 At the time of inspection, firefighters will be making certain that businesses have their licenses posted according to the ordinance.
 The city once had a business license ordinance and contracted with the Harrison Regional Chamber of Commerce to issue licenses, collecting data and fees for the city. But that was found to be contrary to state law and the city was cited in its Legislative Audit. The ordinance establishing the contract was rescinded in 2018 and a new ordinance was passed last year.
 Nichols said the division is operating off the list of businesses made under the old ordinance, but that list is now outdated. New inspections and licenses will update the list.
 Sansing said no bills can be sent out because the list isn’t close to complete.
 “Until this ordinance, we really had no way of knowing what businesses were in town,” Sansing said last October.
 Anyone could simply open shop and the city might not have any idea what they were doing unless it had to be reviewed by the Planning Commission or if the owner applied for a building permit.
 The new requirement will help the city keep records of businesses. It will also help with pre-incident planning by locating utility shutoffs and making a preliminary plan for response in case of fire or other emergency at the business.
 Sansing explained the fee schedule for business licenses.
 For businesses with one to 49 full-time employees, the annual business license fee is $50. From 50-99 full-time employees, the annual fee is $100. The annual fee is $200 for businesses with 100-149 full-time employees, then the fee will be $250 annually for businesses with 150 or more full-time employees.
 You can visit www.cityofharrison.com to find a link to the license application under the Fire Department section. Once the application is filled out, you can mail it to the Harrison Fire Department, 120 North Spring Street, Harrison, AR 72601 along with a check for the fee.
 Owners can also pay by credit card at the time the application is completed (the license is a PDF that can be filled out online and emailed to the department) or at Fire Station No. 1 on North Spring Street next door to City Hall.
 The owner can opt to have the business license emailed to them or they can go to the department and pick it up.
 You can also go to Fire Station No. 1 next door to City Hall to pick up an application or deliver one. The fee can be paid with a credit card either online or at the station.
 Normal business hours at Fire Station No. 1 are 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. The phone number at Fire Station No. 1 is 741-6384 for any questions.
 Once issued, the license must be posted in a conspicuous place inside the business. The permit is good for one year and is valid from Jan. 2 of each year. The license will be valid until Jan. 2, 2021, for anyone who obtained a business between Monday, Oct. 14, of this year and Jan. 2, 2020.
 Division Chief Clint Nichols said a new business opening must undergo a fire inspection by Nichols or fire inspector Lt. Matt Price. Nichols said that inspection must be complete before the business license procedure begins.
 Not all businesses are subject to the fees. For instance, the ordinance exempts:
 • Churches and non-profit organizations (application still required)
 • Hospitals, public schools, or colleges (application still required)
 • Residential and commercial landlords
 • Farmer Markets, and children based (under 18 years old) activities such as lemon aid stands, etc.
 • Home-based type businesses, as well as businesses not having a physical location within the Harrison city limits
 • Other non-brick and mortar type businesses that do not fall under the Insurance Services Office requirements as permitted by the fire chief.

“When I first arrived, I was impressed with the high expectations,” he said. “It’s not pressure, but expectation to put into sports and academics their best effort. Many of our student-athletes work in the off-season to improve themselves and have that desire for personal growth. And success is contagious, so the more successful they are in sports, it will help them in other levels. Many of our athletes have returned to coach our teams, so now they’re successful. If our student-athletes don’t win a title, they’re still winning by becoming the best they can, both on and off the field or court — in everything, as many of them are our top students as well as athletes.”

The Telluride’s electric-shaver grille and tall headlights exude confidence—but you don’t have to look any further than the TELLURIDE lettering on the nose to see Kia knows it has a hit on its hands. The clean shapes and handsome trim choices in the cabin play well off the Telluride’s low dash; we like the lighter-toned wood and leather, where the impression of a luxury car is no longer an impression—it’s the real thing, minus the pricey badge.

_After the electoral victories, these imported armed political thugs were abandoned to hunger and starvation. They devised other means of survival and brought up the idea of Boko Haram, recruited your sons and daughters into the fold, and gradually morphed into the berserk terrorists they are known today. This is a sad history unworthy of recollection or recounting. But it has become necessary at this point to call a spade a spade._
  _The pioneers of this queer version of Islamism have probably all been killed in combats while battling Nigerian security forces over the years. But the inheritors and promoters of this awkward and satanic project are your children, who answer your calls as fathers, uncles and brothers._
  _It 's absolutely indiscernible that BEF had never ever contemplated penetrating the rural populace to dialogue, interact and appeal to their own kith and kin for armistice over a decade of battle or expression of anger in bloodbath. How come they are suddenly afraid of their own children?_
  _CALSER has challenged BEF to show even one instance they embarked on peaceful dialogue with their people on Boko Haram or attempting to win the confidence of the people to sheathe their swords? We guess it will be a hard nut to crack._
  _Is this not shameful enough that elders who are by African tradition supposed to lay down their lives for the younger generation would in reverse order, pleasantly allow the destruction of their posterity and land for whatever reason? What has prevented BEF from fostering persuasive and meaningful dialogues among communities and groups towards ending insurgency?_
  _Each time BEF voices out in the media, its either they are requesting President Buhari to sack Security and Service Chiefs or change the anti-Boko Haram Strike squads on the battlefield. The conduct inspires a lot of suspicions and raises dust on the sincerity of BEF members as a whole on ending insurgency._
  _Borno state has worthy, wealthy and influential sons and daughters, both former and serving government appointees. Honestly what are they doing with this clout and affluence when their land is on fire? Who else do BEF members expect to exclusively blight the fire, while they covertly instigate it and stand on the fence to curry sympathy from the world in undisguised blame games of government and security agents?_
  _We are asking the elders in BEF that where is their impact now that Borno is boiling? Where are all those who have hibernated in BEF as former governors, former or current Senators or House of Reps members? Where are all the current and former ministers, all the former and current and former state assembly legislators?_
  _We want to know the efforts of dialogue all the rich businessmen and women from Borno as well as all the government bureaucrats at both national and state levels have done collectively or individually to quench the fire of insurgency? What role has this rich assemblage of worthy sons and daughters played in bringing an end to Boko Haram insurgency in the state or in complementing the efforts of government and security agents?_
  _It is the greatest shame of a people staring BEF elders in the face before the rest of the world. We are tempted to believe incontrovertibly that while Borno state burns, these wealthy and influential elders revel in affluence and squander in safe havens far-flung from home. And so, they think it is the exclusive responsibility of others to quench the fire of Boko Haram._
  _It is completely unacceptable. Insurgency started in Borno and it must end in Borno where it has receded to concentrate now. The time to tell ourselves some sacrosanct truths is now! We cannot flinch from it forever. BEF must know, the time for the truth and the necessary action to salvage our suffering, deprived and dehumanized people is now!_
  _So, every BEF member must dust the toga aloofness and move into the communities and villages of Borno to speak to their people; invest or spread the wealth through poverty alleviation schemes. BEF must service the cord of fraternity for the rest of us to have peace and security. Again, Boko Haram started in Borno and currently nourished by majority of masked Borno people and BEF must find a non-military solution to it._
  _It 's a mistaken notion to leave this arduous task solely in the hands of the Nigerian Army. Its time all of us must move to either the trenches or invade our communities with messages of peace and reconciliation. If Niger Delta elders can achieve it with militants, it's not impossible in Borno, the Northeast and Nigeria. _
 _Finally, we wish to state clearly that we are issuing a 7-day ultimatum to Borno Elders to initiate necessary actions in consonance with the concerns expressed in this open letter. If after the expiration of the ultimatum and nothing is done, CALSER would be forced to activate other peaceful and lawful instruments in order to give peace and security to our distressed and traumatized humanity in Borno state._

In 2017, Gillespie got 1.18 million votes for governor, the second-highest total for any gubernatorial candidate - behind Northam, of course, who got 1.4 million votes and a nine-point win.
 Even Corey Stewart, a Trump acolyte who received a 16-point trouncing from Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, in 2018, got more votes than Gillespie or Warner in their 2014 Senate battle. While Stewart's 1.37 million votes fell far behind Kaine's 1.9 million, he was ahead of Warner's 1.07 million and Gillespie's 1.06 million.
 Farnsworth said Trump has not been the only factor, particularly in November's elections, when it was clear that the state House and Senate were both up for grabs. Republicans had an overwhelming majority in the House until 2017, when Democrats - surprising even themselves - picked up 15 seats.
 Heading into Nov. 5, Republicans were defending narrow majorities of 20 to 19 in the Senate and 51 to 48 in the House, with one vacancy in each chamber. As it turned out, Democrats picked up six seats in the House, which as of Jan. 8 they will control 55 to 45, and two in the Senate, which they will lead 21 to 19.
 "Virginia faced a pivotal election in 2019 with control of both the House of Delegates and the Senate of Virginia at risk," Farnsworth said. "And as a result of this, Democrats and Republicans engaged in a particularly intense election cycle. Extraordinary amounts of money were delivered to both parties, and top-quality candidates decided to run.
 "And so, to me, there are really two factors here. One is President Trump, but the other is the key nature of this election for the future of Virginia. It was clear to anyone even thinking about voting that 2019 was an election not to miss."
