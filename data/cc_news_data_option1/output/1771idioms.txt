However, behind the scenes tourism officials and hospitality bosses are busy working out how destinations will start to welcome back visitors this summer. Without knowing exactly what changes will be announced when Boris Johnson produces his roadmap on Sunday, tourist boards across the UK are setting out plans for a phased reopening of attractions and businesses as they endeavour to salvage some of the 2020 season. “We can’t afford to wait until lockdown’s over and find we’ve not got the plans in place,” said Gill Haigh, chief executive of Cumbria Tourism. “The question is how we reset.”

It doesn’t seem that long ago when I was in Daytona for Speedweeks all that everyone wanted to talk about was what the schedule was going to look like for the 2021 season and what the new race car that was to be introduced beginning in that season would do for the sport.          That line of thought has long since left the sport as NASCAR because of the impact of COVID-19 has already pushed back the introduction on the new car until the 2022 season and we are now more concerned about what the remainder of this season is going to look like than the 2021 season.

Hotels, restaurants and bars also fear that opening halfway through the season with reduced capacity due to social distancing will be fatal to certain businesses unless the government extends its financial support. In an open letter to Johnson this week, Robin Hutson, chief executive of Homegrown Hotels, which operates six Pig hotels and the Lime Wood Hotel in the New Forest, wrote: “The worst possible scenario for rural hospitality would be the ‘perfect storm’ of furlough ceasing, hospitality opening up, but social distancing rules imposed … This toxic recipe would immediately translate to mass redundancies and the permanent loss of hundreds of thousands of rural jobs. This would be economically and socially devastating for rural Britain.”

According to police, Burgess went into very thorough detail about the sexual things he wanted to do with the girl in messages with her, and admitted to her that he knew it was wrong for a man his age to be in love with a 15-year-old girl. He reportedly told the girl repeatedly that she was “very mature for her age.”
 Police also say that Burgess would threaten juvenile boys who attempted to talk to the girl or those who had been in a previous relationship with her. At one point, Burgess even convinced the girl that he is going to marry her “in three years,” which she agreed to, and the two discussed how many children they were going to have.
 In the messages, Burgess would reportedly call the girl “momma” and she would call him “daddy,” and they would also tell each other “I love you.”
 The complaint says Burgess would use his 14-year-old daughter to get permission for the girl to stay over at his house. Burgess reportedly admitted in the chat messages that his daughter knew about the relationship and was not happy about it.
 Police say the messages also showed that the girl, along with Burgess, would admit with each other that they were dating, how many months they were supposedly together, and that they knew they had to keep it a secret.
 Burgess has been charged with sexual assault in the third degree. He is currently behind bars at Southwestern Regional Jail.

“We understand this remains a time of uncertainty,” said Underwood. “While some services and procedures will reopen, we are not changing the safety measures currently in place and risking the safety and well-being of our patients. Social distancing of at least six foot separation among patients and staff will remain essential, among other restrictions.”
 All patients will be required to wear a face mask, as recommended by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control). All those who arrive without a face mask will be provided one.
 Castle explained that visitation will still be prohibited for inpatients. Family members accompanying elective surgery patients as well as those presenting for routine services such as lab or x-ray, will be asked to wait in their cars to maintain proper social distancing. Dietary services will remain carry out only and Pharmacy services will remain drive thru and delivery only for the time being. Everyone entering the hospital and clinics, including employees, will continue to be screened in order to identify potential COVID-19 cases. Waiting rooms will be set-up to provide six foot separation among patients.
 “The more heavily utilized areas of the hospital continue to be cleaned and sanitized several times throughout the day,” Underwood said. “We continue to place safety first for our patients and employees. This has been an unprecedented time in history and we at Boone Memorial Hospital appreciate the understanding, concern and support being received by our community, patients and staff. We are all in this together and we will continue to fight this pandemic together.”

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Even before the coronavirus hit, cystic fibrosis meant a cold could put Jacob Hansen in the hospital for weeks. He relies on hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes to stay healthy because he also has cerebral palsy and can't easily wash his hands from his wheelchair, but these days shelves are often bare.           For millions of disabled people and their families, the coronavirus crisis has piled on new difficulties and ramped up those that already existed. Many are immunocompromised and therefore more vulnerable to infection, but terrified of new coronavirus-era hospital guidelines they fear could put them at risk.           The leader of the U.N. said Wednesday the 1 billion people living with disabilities around the world have been among the hardest-hit by the virus. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for them to have equal access to prevention and treatment of COVID-19 as the pandemic exposes and intensified global inequalities.           In the U.S., a number of states are moving toward reopening businesses shuttered by the virus, but many people with disabilities are staying behind closed doors, worried that more interaction could lead to a wave of new infections.          “It’s honestly kind of scary, with my disability even the common sniffles could put me in the hospital,” said Hansen, who usually likes volunteering at the library and rubbing shoulders with superheros at Comic-Con.          Hansen, 20, has done well with a new medication and was ready to start a grocery-store job near his Utah home before the virus hit, but the infection risk has put a stop to that for now. He used to have help from health-care workers with things like eating and bathing, but they had to stop coming after one had a potential exposure. The coronavirus test turned out to be negative, but they decided the risk was too high. Now Jodi Hansen does most of those things for her son, bringing drinks, scratching itches and bathing him, even though she has a bad shoulder and is working 40 hours a week from home at her as a transition coordinator for the Utah Parent Center.
