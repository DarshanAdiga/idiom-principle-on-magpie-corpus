Jasprit Bumrah (@Jaspritbumrah93) August 31, 2020


  Put in to bat first, India posted 416 on the back of Hanuma Vihari's maiden Test century.


  In the seventh over of the West Indies innings, Bumrah had opener John Campbell caught behind.


  In the second ball of his next over, he bowled a beautiful out-swinger across left-hander Darren Bravo, who edged it to KL Rahul in the slips cordon.


  Shamarh Brooks was the next batsman in and Bumrah trapped him LBW with an in- swinger.


  Chase was next, and he failed to connect with yet another in-swinger. The umpire initially said it was not out, but India captain Virat Kohli reviewed, and rightly so, as Bumrah got a well-deserved hat-trick.


  Only Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan had taken hat-tricks in the longest format of the game for India before Bumrah.


  Bumrah finished the innings with figures of 6-27, which included the top five batsmen in the West Indies line-up and captain Jason Holder.

  It was Bumrah's second five-wicket haul in the two-match series, which India swept 2-0.

ZANU PF FACTIONS BACK WITH A VENGEANCE

City Police Chief Jeff O’Brien has handled several complaints about a large encampment that sprung up near Ross’ campsite.


  The group, settled near the Commons’ women’s trail east of Elmwood Street, has spurred noise complaints and reports of drunkenness and physical and verbal attacks, O’Brien said.


  “The sanitary conditions were not good at all,” he added, noting the space is overcrowded and residents damaged nearby trees and foliage. “I called Ryan and said, ‘We’ve gotta get some folks moved outta here.’”


  The camp’s residents have since been told they have until Labor Day to pack up and move on.


  Breaking the camp up wasn’t an easy call.


  O’Brien said the decision followed multiple complaints, officers discovering the site’s unsanitary conditions and the camp’s avoidance of resources provided, like a porta-potty and dumpsters. Many walkers and runners have lodged complaints about being unable to pass through that stretch of trail without name-calling or other confrontation.


  “You can’t go to the bathroom and eat in the same place,” O’Brien said. “One or two people kinda ruin it for everybody.”


  Typically, city police don’t go looking for encampments and don’t disturb them without reason. Instead, policy has become giving Hannon a ring when there’s an incident — provided it’s not an emergency.


  Often, those calls are referrals for people who are ill or newly homeless, Hannon said.


  Any heavier-handed responses, like uprooting camps, are complaint-driven.


  Those situations wouldn’t come to a head if local leadership pushed for better options, O’Brien added — like low-income housing.


  The lack of long-term shelter is a bigger issue in the face of the pandemic’s likely continuation through winter.


  It worries Hannon.


  “There’s an ongoing concern that many other places aren’t going to open that normally would,” he said.


  Ross doesn’t worry. Thanks to help from Goodwill Street Outreach and other volunteers, he’ll be moving into a new home on Sept. 1.


  “I’ll be out of the woods and in my house,” he said with a grin. “Of course, it’s 10 miles out of town, so it’s kinda a struggle — I’m not one to ride a bike 10 miles.”


  There simply aren’t enough homes to provide the same to everyone in his shoes.


  “We all want the same solution — the conditions for people living unsheltered, it’s not good. It’s not acceptable,” Hannon said. “Nobody wants to see people experiencing homelessness. Nobody wants to experience homelessness.


  “The only way out of this is housing.”

The 2020 MTV VMAs took place in New York last night, and while the show was thought to be streamed live, it turns out that many of this year's speeches, performances and red carpet appearances were actually pre-recorded - with some celebs not even setting foot in NYC.


  While it was known that this year's VMAs would be happening with "limited or no audience" due to the coronavirus pandemic, the awards show still claimed to be "live from multiple outdoor locations across New York City".


  However, it's since been discovered that not _all_ celeb appearances were live, with stars __including Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande shooting their performances on a green screen in LA to make it look like they were in New York, according to reports.


  We can't decide what's more awkward: a fake backdrop or the cringe fake audience screams edited in throughout the show. Ouch.


  While it of course makes sense for the ceremony to be adapted for the pandemic, the decision for a large amount of the show to be pre-recorded wasn't fully announced, with fans quickly figuring it out once they realised that celebs who were supposed to be at the event actually weren't... all thanks to Instagram Stories.


  As the show aired, Miley Cyrus was, erm, in the gym, while Bella Hadid was out and about in a garden and Lady Gaga was hosting a VMAs watch party.

Dear Dave,


  My in-laws have very generously offered my wife and me $250,000 to help with a down payment on a home. I know the amount exceeds the IRS's yearly gift allowance, but they want to structure it as a family loan and have already told us they don't care if we pay it back. If we accept, we technically owe them a lot of money. If we say no, they may be offended. What do you think about this and how it might impact the relationship?


  James


  Dear James,


  Well, it makes sense your wife would be on board with the whole thing. It's her dad making the offer, so of course, she would be a lot more comfortable with the idea than you are.


  This is a big deal, and it's something you two should have a very serious conversation about. Get on the same page in every regard. Also, I'd recommend making sure you get everything in writing. See to it, as well, that it can be forgiven at the maximum allowable annual gift rate.


  In addition, in the event of death, make sure it's included in the estate, it's forgiven and there will be zero call on the note. In effect, that would make it an advance on your inheritance instead of debt. Under no circumstances should they, or any other heirs, have grounds to call the note.


  That's a good question, James. And a nice gift!


  Dave


  Dear Dave,


  I have a full-time job, but I also have a side job providing firewood to help pay off debt. I make $600 to $1,000 a month with this project. My log splitter went down recently when a hydraulic line burst and the machine caught on fire. I'm not sure how much it will cost to get it going again. Should I invest in a new one that will increase my productivity and help me pay off debt faster?


  Chris


  Dear Chris,


  If I'm in your shoes, I'm going to fix the old one. Even if it means duct tape and glue, I'm going to try to find a way to repair it instead of spending a bunch of money or going deeper into debt.


  If you can't do that at a reasonable price out of pocket, I'd be in the market for a decent, used log splitter. And pay cash! I get your line of thinking when it comes to increasing productivity. Splitting wood is real work. But don't try to justify buying an expensive, new piece of equipment when it's just not necessary.


  If you're making that much with a side hustle, you can make your money back on a used splitter in a month or two - three at the most. Be smart about it, Chris!

A dangerous driver who killed a cyclist while he was crossing the road in Trumpington was jailed for three years.


  Miles Polite, 28, of Cornfields, Burwell, was driving his yellow Ford Focus when he struck Stewart Milne, 44, as he was crossing the road at around 10.20pm on December 12, 2017.


  Polite stopped at the scene and called emergency services for assistance, telling a call handler "I hit the guy, he was going across the pedestrian crossing but it was a green light".


  Keen cyclist and father of three Mr Milne was taken to hospital where he died two days later on the evening of December 14.


  Polite admitted during a roadside police interview that he "might have been going a bit too fast".


  Enquiries subsequently revealed that Polite would have been travelling at around 45mph in a 30mph zone at the time of the collision.


  On August 24, Polite pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and was handed three years in prison. He was also disqualified from driving for four and a half years.

An update to my review below now that it's got 75k miles. I have done 30k miles in 3 years and so far have had no issues at all with reliability. The car runs like it is brand new, the transmission is extremely smooth shifting. The interior still looks great and materials are holding up very well. All I have done is change 2 front tires, the oil and other fluids. The one thing that really bugs me though is a squeaky back shelf when it is cold outside. It is very very annoying and very loud and I cannot figure out how to stop it. Maybe it's a simple fix but I haven't figured it out. The drive in incredible - extemely responsive, very nimble handling and is quick when you want it to be. The tiptronic manual option is a real blast to use. I'd buy this car again if only for the squeaky shelf - but I plan on giving it to my kids in a couple of year as I think it will be a very safe first car. The car is 6 years old, but the design was ahead of the curve, so it still looks like a new car design.

Subcompact crossovers haven't been around for very long, but there's already a critical mass of competitors for the CX-3 to check out. Tops on the list is the 2016 Honda HR-V, which lacks the CX-3's quickness and agility but counters with comparable fuel economy and superior cargo capacity. You've also got the Fiat Chrysler cousins, the 2016 Fiat 500X and the 2016 Jeep Renegade, with the former offering Italian flair and the latter boasting real off-road ability. Another rival worth trying is the venerable Nissan Juke, which is the quickest of the bunch in a straight line but has comparatively little interior space. They're all worthy candidates, but the 2016 Mazda CX-3 keeps them honest with its strong performance across the board.

In accepting the Republican nomination for a second term as president, Donald Trump sounded lofty themes of national unity and love for country while also offering a glowing and highly exaggerated account of his stewardship. He claimed, for example, that he had done more for African Americans than any president since Abraham Lincoln and promised to produce a coronavirus vaccine “before the end of the year or maybe even sooner.”


  He also made characteristically reckless attacks on his Democratic opponent, suggesting that the election of Joe Biden would threaten the American way of life. “Despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now endangered,” Trump ominously warned. “This election will decide whether we save the American dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny ... Your vote will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans, or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists, agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens.”

One person was shot and killed late on Saturday in Portland in the US state of Oregon, as a large caravan of President Donald Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters clashed in the streets, police said.


  It wasn’t clear if the shooting was linked to fights that broke out as a caravan of about 600 vehicles was confronted by counter-demonstrators in the city’s downtown.


  Police said the caravan had left the area around 8:30pm, and officers heard gunshots around 15 minutes later, according to a statement.


  Officers arrived at the shooting scene “within a minute,” police said, but the man who was shot did not survive.


  Police said the man was shot in the chest. He was not immediately identified. It’s unclear who shot him.


  “This violence is completely unacceptable and we are working diligently to find and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible,” Police Chief Chuck Lovell said.


  Portland has been the site of nightly protests for more than three months since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Many of them end in vandalism and violence, and hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested by local and federal law enforcement since late May.


  In the two hours following the shooting, protesters gathered downtown and there was sporadic fighting and vandalism, police said. Ten people were arrested.


  The caravan had arrived downtown just as a protest planned for Saturday was getting underway. It marked the third Saturday in a row that Trump supporters have rallied in the city.


  The chaotic scene came two days after Trump invoked Portland as a liberal city overrun with violence in a speech at the Republican National Convention as part of his “law and order” re-election campaign theme.


  The morning after the clashes, Trump issued a flurry of tweets and retweets including several that blamed Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler for the death and one in which the president appeared to be encouraging his supporters to move into Portland.


  “GREAT PATRIOTS!” Trump wrote as he shared video of his supporters driving into Portland to confront the protesters.


  Trump and other Republican speakers at last week’s convention evoked a violent, dystopian future of the US if Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wins in November and pointed to Portland as a cautionary tale for what would be in store for Americans.


  The pro-Trump rally’s organizer, who recently coordinated a similar caravan in Boise, Idaho, said in a video posted on Twitter on Saturday afternoon that attendees should only carry concealed weapons and the route was being kept secret for safety reasons.


  The caravan had gathered earlier in the day at a suburban mall and drove to the heart of Portland. As they arrived in the city, protesters attempted to stop them by standing in the street and blocking bridges.


  Videos from the scene showed sporadic fighting, as well as Trump supporters firing paintball pellets at opponents and using bear spray as counter- protesters threw things at the Trump caravan.


  The Black Lives Matter demonstrations usually target police buildings and federal buildings.


  Some protesters have called for reductions in police budgets while the city’s mayor and some in the Black community have decried the violence, saying it’s counter-productive.


  Early on Saturday, fires set outside a police union building that is a frequent site for protests prompted police to declare a riot.


  An accelerant was used to ignite a mattress and other debris laid against the door of the Portland Police Association building, police said in a statement. At least one dumpster was also set on fire in the street nearby.

Sürekli olarak terör örgütleriyle kol kola girip iş birliği yapan CHP, son olarak şehit Savcı Mehmet Selim Kiraz soruşturması kapsamında tutuklanan ve cezaevinde yaptığı açlık grevi sonrası hayatını kaybeden DHKP-C üyesi Ebru Timtik'e sahip çıktı. Sabah Gazetesi yazarı Hilal Kaplan bugün köşesinde kaleme aldığı yazıda CHP ile terör örgütü arasındaki bu iş birliğine dikkat çekerek 'Gözlerimizin önünde bir terör örgütü meşrulaştırılıyor.' dedi. İşte Sabah Gazetesi yazarı Hilal Kaplan'ın 'DHKP-CHP' başlıklı o yazısı Ajit- prop, dikkatleri belli bir meselenin tek boyutuna çekerek, sistematik bir çabayla, genellikle hoşnutsuzluk, öfke ve nefret gibi duyguları çoğaltarak bir kitlenin tutum ve davranışlarını yönlendirme çabasıdır. Sovyet propaganda makinesinin keşfi ve temel taşı bu yöntemi en çok kullanan terör örgütü DHKP-C'dir. Ebru Timtik'in ölümle sonlanan inadı da örgüt dinamiklerinden bağımsız düşünülemez. Daha önce örgüte eleman kazandırdığı bilinen, Şehit Savcımız Mehmet Selim Kiraz'ın katillerini haklı bulan, kariyeri DHKP-C'lilerin avukatlığını yapmakla geçmiş, en son örgütten kızını almaya gelen anneye 'Kimsin sen ya' diye çıkıştığı anların videosunu izlediğimiz militan bir DHKP-C'li idi Timtik. Örgüt kararı ile kendini açlığa, ölüme mahkum etti ve öldü. Ama DHKP-C zihniyetiyle yakın olan CHP İstanbul İl Başkanı Canan Kaftancıoğlu, Adana gibi bir ilin CHP İl Başkanlığı başta olmak üzere farklı CHP teşkilatları, sözde ulusalcı Yılmaz Özdil, İstanbul Barosu, Birgün ve Cumhuriyet gibi daha önce de örgüt propagandası yapmış yayın organları... Bir de 'İslâmcı vicdanjörler' var tabii ama neyse ki etkileri az. Gözlerimizin önünde bir terör örgütü meşrulaştırılıyor. En iyi ihtimal terör yardakçısı olan bir isim, örgüt talimatı veya kendi kararı fark etmez, neticede devlet kaynaklı bir durum yokken kendini öldürüyor. Hepsi bir ağızdan robot gibi 'Adil yargılanmadı, zulmedildi, ölüme mahkum edildi' diyor. Niye adil yargılanmamış? Avukata erişim, kendini savunma hakkı, delillere erişim ve sorgulama, hangi eksik hak söz konusu, söylenmiyor. Çünkü gerçek önemsiz. Ajitasyon bahane, propaganda şahane!

Infatti, l'art. 7 del predetto decreto prevede uno specifico esonero contributivo che, configurando un aiuto di Stato, e subordinato all'autorizzazione della Commissione europea ai sensi e per gli effetti dell'art. 108, paragrafo 3 del Trattato di funzionamento dell'Unione europea. In particolare, concerne tutte le assunzioni - effettuate fino al 31.12.2020 - a tempo determinato ovvero con contratto di lavoro stagionale nei settori del turismo e degli stabilimenti termali, per un massimo di tre mesi. Inoltre, lo stesso esonero puo essere applicato anche nei casi di conversione (recte trasformazione) di un contratto a tempo determinato in un contratto a tempo indeterminato a condizione che detta trasformazione avvenga a far tempo dalla data di entrata in vigore del decreto n. 104/2020 (ergo 15 agosto 2020).

Brian Austin Green isn't ruling out a possible reconciliation with estranged wife Megan Fox. The _90210_ actor opened up about their "different paths" during an Instagram Live Saturday, saying that while the actress is currently dating Machine Gun Kelly, he can't say definitively what the future holds for he and Fox. "I never say never," Green said when asked about maybe repairing his marriage.
 "I kinda feel like people are on paths in life and sometimes your paths are together and you travel that path together and you see eye to eye and then sometimes paths do different things," Green continued, adding that before their split at the end of the year, he and Fox had an "amazing" 15-year relationship as well as sons Noah Shannon, 7, Bodhi Ransom, 6, and Journey River, 3.
 "Right now the paths are different and she is on her path doing what she feels she needs to be doing to be happy and I'm on my path doing what I feel I need to do to be happy and it's not for a lack of love for the kids or lack of being responsible," he added, saying he wished her "all the best" and had nothing against Machine Gun Kelly.
 "Do I like Megan's new man?" he responded to a fan's question. "I've never met him, I have no idea." The actor continued that while has heard "bad stories" about the rapper, he's heard stories about himself that are untrue in the press as well. "As of right now, I have no problem with him at all," he explained. "I really hope that he and Megan are happy."

 Green went on that it would be "selfish" of him to only want the _Jennifer's Body_ actress to be happy with him. "We did that for 15 years. If that has run its course, then so be it. That's not a failure," he said. "It was a really special relationship, and it still is." At some point in the future, the _Desperate Housewives_ actor thinks he and Fox's "paths will regulate a bit and run parallel to each other." He added, "Not necessarily the same but that's OK. Sometimes you have to sort of really swing far away from something to find a more stable ground to stand on."
 Green announced in May that he and Fox had split at the beginning of the year following her time overseas filming a movie. In March, Fox met Kelly on the set of their upcoming movie together, _Midnight in the Switchgrass_ , and the two quickly became inseparable, with Kelly saying recently he is "locked in" with his new girlfriend.

Second, it's not going to break the speed barrier. It has a 2.5 liter 152 cubic inch front wheel drive motor that only produces 167 horsepower@ 6000rpm and 168 foot pounds of torque @ 4000 rpm. Its a peppy 4-cylinder motor without a turbo. It will do 0-60 mph in approximately 7.5 to 8.5 seconds depending on having the manual or automatic transmission. If you "need" something quicker the MAZDASPEED 3 is the version for what you want with a turbocharged 2.3 liter 263 hp @5500 rpm with a 6-speed manual. Mazda has this covered for you. Do you really need something quicker? My 2005 Mustang with the 4.0 liter V6 with cold air intake got 17 mpg to 25 mpg and it was running around 225 horsepower at a curb weight of 3300 lbs. On the interstate my Mustang could keep up with a new 2010 Shelby Mustang at twice the price to it's owners dislike. This isn't the Autobahn, so once you are at highway speed a quicker 0-60 and higher top end is irrelevant. It has more than enough power to merge with traffic both on and off the interstate. On an emergency trip to our local vet hospital, I was more than impressed with not only it's speed, but also it's stability and handling.

The SA Joint Anti Child Exploitation Team (JACET) charged the man, 62, after receiving information from the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) that sparked an investigation. AUSTRAC financial intelligence found people in Australia allegedly sending suspicious payments to known facilitators of abusive material. The accused is allegedly one of them and is suspected of transferring about $65,000 to different recipients in the Philippines since 2006.SA JACET searched the man’s home last month and seized a laptop, USB, DVDs and CDs, a dozen Western Union money transfer forms and external hard drives. Investigators later allegedly found the abusive material and communication with suspected Philippines residents. The man was later charged with possessing and using a carriage service to access child abuse material, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in jail.He was due to appear in the Elizabeth Magistrates Court on Monday. The seized items are still being analysed, and further charges could be laid. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) said information was provided to Philippines authorities to try to identify any victims and perpetrators.AFP detective Acting Superintendent Gavin Stone said children were being forced into the most appalling violence on camera for money, and anyone who viewed this material online was just as complicit in the abuse as those who physically harmed a child.“No child anywhere in the world should have to be victimised for the perverted desires of some people in our community,” Supt Stone said.“The AFP and South Australia Police are working around the clock with our partners to bring to justice those who seek to do harm to our children.” AUSTRAC intelligence partnerships national manager Bradley Brown said monitoring the transactions people used to pay for online child abuse materials was one of the most effective ways of tracking down individuals committing these abhorrent offences.

NEWBURY — After months of being closed to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic, plans are in place to resume in-person access to the Town Offices on Kent Way early next week. During this next phase of the town’s reopening, the public may enter the building by appointment only, Town Administrator Tracy Blais said at a recent selectboard meeting.


  The board also heard briefly from Joyce Machiros, Evelyn Noyes, and Sandee Small, of the Newbury Council on Aging Expansion Committee. They issued a report in June on the programming and space needs for the Senior Center, noting that the current location lacks adequate exterior parking as well as the proper interior space for programs and administrative tasks and dedicated restroom facilities that aren’t shared with the Newbury Elementary School. The COA space, located inside the school, isn’t compliant with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its Protected Health Information regulations.


  With the new police station near completion and money secured for upgrading the Town Hall, Chair JR Colby said he felt it was time to “get this project in the pipeline.” Vice Chair Alicia Greco thanked the three women for their “excellent analysis of COA needs,” noting that the next step is to conduct a formal needs assessment by an outside agency.

TIRUCHI


  Intra-district public bus services are all set to resume on Tuesday after a gap of two months with the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation authorities making all arrangements for operation of its buses ensuring adherence to the government guidelines.


  The services, which resumed with restrictions in June after a gap of over two months when the lockdown was clamped in late March, were suspended later that month in view of the spread of the viral infection.


  Consequent to the State government's announcement on Sunday, the public transport services are set for resumption from Tuesday. Senior TNSTC officials in Tiruchi and Pudukottai regions said that the plan is to operate about 50% of the corporation buses within the respective districts.


  The TNSTC Tiruchi region encompassing Tiruchi, Perambalur and Ariyalur district has a fleet of 930 buses, while the Corporation's Pudukottai Region has a total number of 383 buses. Ahead of the resuming the services from Tuesday, the TNSTC buses were disinfected on Monday in the respective depots.


  The TNSTC, Tiruchi region, has a total number of 13 depots with 10 of them in Tiruchi district; two in Ariyalur and one in Perambalur. The number of depots in Pudukottai region was nine with seven depots in Pudukottai district alone and one each in Tiruchi and Thanjavur district. The bus drivers and conductors have been communicated about the resumption of services from September 1, said the officials.


  The officials say although all the buses in their fleet were ready for operation the initial plan was to operate 50 per cent of the services on the day of resumption to ascertain the ground-level situation and act accordingly. The drivers and conductors have already been provided with masks, gloves and sanitisers. In Pudukottai, face shields have also been provided to the drivers and conductors additionally, says a senior TNSTC official adding that seating arrangements inside the vehicles would be made to ensure personal distancing. In Tiruchi region, the bus drivers and conductors would soon be provided with face shields as a protective measure, another senior official said.


  The services would resume from the early hours on Tuesday and the buses would be operated within the jurisdiction of the respective district and head back. Passengers would be insisted to wear mask before boarding vehicles, the officials said.

Overall, we've given the Mazda 3 a top Edmunds.com "A" rating and a recommended spot in our 2015 Sedan Buying Guide. But it is one of several excellent compact cars available today. The Ford Focus is also enjoyable to drive and has a high-quality interior with many high-tech options. The stylish 2015 Kia Forte isn't as entertaining, but it's hard to beat for value. The always dependable Honda Civic and high-end 2015 Volkswagen Golf are also great picks worth considering. It's going to be hard to choose, but if you want a car that covers the bases and does it with flair, we think the 2015 Mazda 3 is the way to go.

  Vibes, tazes, topazes, and other boats zoomed about the Seaton bay over the three-day holiday.


  For many this was the first time on the water since last year due to the Covid-19 lockdown which coincided with the beginning of the sailing season.


  On Sunday afternoon the northerly wind made for flat seas and ideal conditions for launching and retrieving the dinghies.


  Axe Yacht Club has been committed to getting cadets and families out sailing dinghies within the safe parameters of the pandemic restrictions and RYA guidance.


  _Axe Yacht Club members in action. Picture PAUL SAMMONS_


  However, this has not been straightforward and has required restrictions on the use of the club house and changing facilities, as well as distancing on the water.


  This means that those sailing together in a dinghy or boat must be within the same ‘bubble’ and must be able to launch and retrieve the boats themselves.


  Two support boats also with crews in respective social ‘bubbles’ were out due to the number of sailors including cadets to assist where necessary.


  Amanda Parker, commodore of Axe Yacht Club said: “I was so thrilled to see so many of our younger sailors out enjoying the very favourable sailing conditions.

The Mazda 6 does have a few minor shortcomings, the most notable being middling fuel economy and the cabin's occasionally cheap plastics. At the same time, there are some newer family sedans that might hold more appeal. The smooth-riding Hyundai Sonata is worth a look, as is the undeniably handsome Kia Optima -- both come chock-full of unexpected standard features and are more affordable than the 6. The Volkswagen Passat offers European refinement, and the sporty Nissan Altima, spacious Honda Accord and engaging Ford Fusion are also fine choices. Despite these talented rivals, the 2012 Mazda 6 is still a very worthy pick, especially for those who love to drive.


  ## 2012 Mazda 6 models


  The 2012 Mazda 6 is available in six trim levels: i Sport, i Touring, i Touring Plus, i Grand Touring, s Touring Plus and s Grand Touring. Models with the "i" prefix come with the four-cylinder engine, while models with the "s" prefix come with the V6.

Mazda 3s models get a 2.5-liter four-cylinder generating 184 hp and 185 lb-ft of torque, joined to a six-speed automatic transmission (the manual is not available). EPA-estimated fuel economy for this engine in the sedan is 32 mpg combined (28 mpg city/39 mpg highway). According to Mazda, adding the optional i-ELOOP system that captures and redistributes braking energy improves fuel economy by as much as 10 percent, but we think 5 percent is more realistic. The EPA's tests validated a 1-mpg improvement across the board to the 3s hatchback's fuel consumption.
 ## Safety
 Every Mazda 3 comes equipped with antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, active front head restraints, front side airbags and side curtain airbags. A blind-spot monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alerts comes standard on the 3i Touring trim level and above, while the 3i Grand Touring and above also have a rearview camera. The available Technology package for the 3s Grand Touring includes a lane departure warning system, forward collision warning and Mazda's Smart City Brake Support, which is a collision- mitigation system that can automatically brake the car to a stop at low speeds if the driver doesn't react to an imminent collision.

The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards took place overnight, and Lady Gaga wowed the show and the red carpet in an array of different outfits - all complete with a matching mask.


  The 'Rain On Me' singer led the awards with nine nominations, and wore a different outfit for each one. Throughout the evening she kept her nose and mouth covered with an array of creative coverings, and during an acceptance speech told the audience: "Stay safe, speak your mind, and I might sound like a broken record, but wear a mask -- it's a sign of respect."


  Not only did we get two red carpet looks from Gaga (an actual red carpet!) she also performed a medley alongside Ariana Grande, and changed mid-way through. Oh, and not to mention her many different looks for accepting awards. Fancy checking them all out? Keep scrolling to see every outfit...

It had been revealed that Heer Khan was making anti-Hindu and anti-national videos from the last two years. The video that caused the controversy had indecent comments about Mata Sita and Ayodhya. Her previous YouTube channel was banned, and she made a new one in January this year. Heer Khan alias Sana Khan made derogatory remarks on Hindu Gods and Goddesses, after which she was arrested on 26th August. The initial investigation has stunned the police. To ensure they get a chance to dig deeper into her connections with Islamist countries and anti-national elements, police have registered a case against her under several sections, including 153B of sedition, sections 295A, 298, 505 (1B), 505 (2B), and 124A. The court granted permission for 5-day police custody starting from 30th August.

In Edmunds testing, an automatic-equipped Mazda 6 sprinted to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds, which is a quick time for a midsize sedan with a base four-cylinder engine. The EPA estimates fuel economy at 30 mpg combined (26 city/38 highway) for the automatic-transmission car and 29 mpg combined (25/37) with the manual. With the Grand Touring's optional i-Eloop feature, fuel economy rises to an impressive 32 mpg combined (28/40).


  ## Safety


  Standard safety features for the Mazda 6 include antilock disc brakes, traction and stability control, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and active front head restraints. Standard on all trims other than the manual-transmission Sport is a rearview camera, while rear parking sensors are optional across the board. The Touring and Grand Touring trims additionally include blind-spot and rear cross-traffic monitoring.

Completely redesigned for 2012, the latest Mazda 5 is an evolution of the previous model. Highlights include a bit more power, more comfortable seating and swoopier styling. At its core, however, the 5 remains a mini-minivan for those with modest family transportation needs. With two seats in each of its three rows, it only seats six compared to the seven- or eight-passenger seating of a big minivan (now that's an oxymoron). But if occasions to haul multiple passengers are few and far between, the Mazda 5's design has a sizable (size being the operative word here) practical advantage over compact crossover SUVs.

This text is a reaction to Mr. Bryan's letter of criticism (OCM July 25, 2020) of Mr. Sullivan's July 15 text in the OCM. It is disconcerting to say the least that Mr. Bryan and Mr. Sullivan and myself agree on so much, such as the anti-Americanism embedded in repression of minorities in our country, yet disagree over "the end does not justify the means," with which Mr. Bryan evidently disagrees. Indeed the end does not justify the means: racial lethal repression cannot be condoned by the blanket justification of law and order; uniformed thugs must not rule our society. Indeed they must not, even by people hailed by Mr. Bryan as "constructive non-violent militants" that led others to destructive violence, such as the Black Panthers, Angela Davis, Kwame Ture and more.


  The positive goal of racial justice and peace does not justify alliance with the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) organization and its promoters. Their sole objective is to support the foreign policies of a pair of tyrannical and violent foreign governments - specifically the "Palestine Authority" ruling the West Bank (of the Jordan River) and the terrorist Hamas of Gaza. How on earth can an American claim to support American ideals, if and while supporting the destruction of the only democracy in the MidEast? Especially when that nation (Israel) is incessantly libeled as "apartheid" - which categorically it is not. Indeed all the Muslim Mideastern countries are apartheid, but not the tiny solitary Israelite country in ancestral Cana'an. BDS has learned from Hebrew the word "hutzpah" (in English gall, impudence, effrontery), and applies it with steroids to hide its own betrayal of America.


  The intersectional link and solidarity the BDS wants and needs with the supporters of the Black Lives Matter motto (myself included), is abhorrent. It wishes to link the most positive development in modern American inter-racial development, with that most anti-American expressions of warped mob-mind, anti-Semitism.


  I call upon all readers regardless of political convictions, to refuse this link, and discard it into refuse.


  With regards to Mr. Richard Rothstein' justified letter in OCM of Aug 5, I believe I am the person with whom he spoke and mentioned. We agree the motto Black Lives Matter is correct and legitimate and I say it needs to be supported. We also agree the BLM slogan has been hijacked by a crowd of extremists for whom violent anger is the first and only expression on their to-do list. This crown has organized in the BLM Foundation and the Movement for BL (MBL), and Mr. Rothstein fears support for the spirit of the motto, can be misconstrued as support for the hijackers. I am confident Rev. MLK Jr., had he been still alive, would have rejected their ways and means. Especially rejected their alliance with the BDS organization (a foreign Palestinian NGO of no redeeming quality whatsoever).

Ulteriore comune denominatore per fruire dell'indennita de qua e che tutte le categorie di lavoratori finora menzionate non devono, alla data di presentazione della domanda, essere titolari di un rapporto di lavoro subordinato a tempo indeterminato (eccezion fatta per quello intermittente) e/o essere titolari di pensione. Per completezza, si segnala che il comma 4 ricomprende fra i beneficiari anche i lavoratori iscritti al Fondo pensioni lavoratori dello spettacolo. Quanto alla categoria dei lavoratori subordinati stagionali e necessario effettuare un distinguo fra quelli operanti nel settore turismo e stabilimenti termali da quelli, ex adverso, rientranti in settori differenti. Piu in dettaglio, il comma 1 prevede che la predetta indennita spetti ai lavoratori dipendenti stagionali (anche se dipendenti da agenzie di somministrazione i cui utilizzatori siano) del settore turismo e degli stabilimenti termali che abbiano cessato involontariamente il rapporto di lavoro nel periodo compreso tra il 1° gennaio 2019 e il 17 marzo 2020, non titolari di pensione, ne di rapporto di lavoro dipendente, ne di NASpI, alla data del 15 agosto 2020 (entrata in vigore del D.L. n. 104/2020). Il comma 2, lettera a), invece, si occupa dei dipendenti stagionali differenti dal settore turismo e stabilimenti termali. Per tale tipologia e prevista, oltre alla cessazione involontaria del rapporto nel periodo 01.01.2019 - 17.03.2020, anche lo svolgimento della prestazione lavorativa per almeno trenta giorni nel citato periodo. Infine, il comma 5 individua, quali ulteriori percettori dell'indennita in questione, i lavoratori dipendenti a tempo determinato del settore del turismo e degli stabilimenti termali, prevedendo espressamente che, al fine della percezione dei 1.000 euro debbano essere in possesso cumulativamente dei seguenti requisiti: a) titolarita nel periodo compreso tra il 1° gennaio 2019 e il 17 marzo 2020 di uno o piu contratti di lavoro a tempo determinato nel settore del turismo e degli stabilimenti termali, di durata complessiva pari ad almeno trenta giornate; b) titolarita nell'anno 2018 di uno o piu contratti di lavoro a tempo determinato o stagionale nel medesimo settore di cui alla lettera a), di durata complessiva pari ad almeno trenta giornate; c) assenza di titolarita, al momento dell'entrata in vigore del presente decreto, di pensione e di rapporto di lavoro dipendente.

In Article 3 of the state constitution, the people divided power among the executive, legislative and judicial branches (as happened in the federal constitution).


  In particular, Colorado’s executive branch (the governor and his lieutenant) is required to faithfully execute the laws of the state while the laws must come from the Legislature. On this latter point the constitution is clear: “No law shall be passed except by bill” (Article 5, section 17). The people of Colorado gave elected members of the legislative branch alone the responsibility to create laws. The constitution also emphasizes that each branch of government must stay in its lane, so to speak. It says no member of one branch can exercise the powers of another branch “except as in this constitution expressly directed or permitted” (Article 3).


  This is where Gov,. Polis’ executive orders fall short. In his July 16 rollout of new rules, including the mandate to wear a mask in public, the governor said, “This is a law like any other.” No, it (and they) is not. Under our Constitution, bills are proposed and passed through the Colorado House and Senate. They are subject to public hearings, debates and amendments in both bodies. Only after this process is complete do bills go to the governor to be signed into law. That’s not the process for executive orders.

The CX-3's ride quality is on the firm side, especially with the lower- profile 18-inch tires on Touring and Grand Touring trims. If you're considering those trim levels, we'd suggest that you try out a Sport, too; it has 16-inch tires with taller sidewalls with which to absorb road irregularities. Either way, road and wind noise levels in the CX-3 are low compared to class norms, bolstering the premium feel established by the CX-3's cabin and driving dynamics.


  ## Interior


  With a keen attention to design, the 2017 CX-3's cabin looks sleek and contemporary, and it's trimmed in materials that look reasonably high-end. The plain Jane gauge cluster in lower trims makes way for a prominent central tachometer and integrated digital speedometer in Grand Touring trim.

Broadmoor President and CEO Jack Damioli issued the following statement Sunday:


  "The Broadmoor had reported five positive Covid cases within its 1,150 total employee population since July 25. The employees affected by this virus have been from various departments across the resort’s 5,000 acre campus.


  "During this time frame, the resort has accommodated well over 50,000 overnight guests, as well as many day visitors on its grounds. These cases represent five one thousandths of a percent of the people at the property during this time frame.


  "I remain very proud of The Broadmoor’s loyal employees for working in a safe manner in these challenging times to serve our guests, as they always have done, for the last 102 years."


  The outbreak comes about two months after the historic hotel reopened after shutting its doors in mid-March amid the onset of the global pandemic in the U.S.


  After implementing new safety protocols, it reopened its 784 rooms to guests at the end of June, including those in suites, cottages, an estate house on the Broadmoor’s southwest campus and three offsite wilderness retreat areas.


  Other amenities, including the Broadmoor Seven Falls, a series of scenic waterfalls in South Cheyenne Canyon, as well as its spa, the Golden Bee Tavern, Ristorante Del Lago and its golf courses, also reopened.


  Since reopening, social-distance markings were installed on the lobby floor and automated hand-sanitizer stations were placed at the main entrances and elevator banks. Behind the scenes, efforts to limit risks from COVID-19 were spelled out in a 13-page document posted on the hotel’s website.


  The hotel also said it would use “electrostatic sprayers” to apply an antimicrobial coating to high-touch areas and fabrics in its rooms. If a guest becomes ill, they will receive “paramedic/in-house doctor assessments,” by phone or in-person.


  The Broadmoor joins a growing list of restaurants, day care facilities, churches and other facilities across the county to report outbreaks of the virus. A full list of outbreaks are listed on the county’s website.

 Due to difficult family urgency issues, my wife logged over 2000 miles the first month. If it hadn't been such a sweet, effortless driving experience, she couldn;t have managed it. It made the impossible possible. Most of the traveling involved mountain driving, the shortest distance to and from the destination. She felt secure making it in the Mazda. She would have gone the long way with any of our previous cars. That is saying a lot for her to feel comfortable choosing the 2 lane mountain road. She loves her I phone and frequently talks while driving. She has given up her ear buds and now loves to talk through the car using Blue Tooth. Works well for her. Given that most of our traveling has been on grades or around town, we have yet to see anything close to 40mpg. It has all been between 30-35. Still much better than our previous vehicles. We challenged the back storage behind the back seat today with a large grocery shopping trip. Even I was amazed at all we got in there (stacking it of course), with room to spare. Overall it has been a joy, a lifesaver, and is turning into a trusted friend.

"I hope this will lead to all sorts of positive things including the reconsideration in the Sports Ministry of the Arjuna award and the Dronacharya awards for chess. It has been a long time," said the country's first Khel Ratna awardee, India's highest sporting honour.
 The last time a chess player received the Arjuna was in 2013 when Abhijeet Gupta was bestowed the honour, while a chess coach has been given the Dronacharya just twice -- Raghunandan Vasant Gokhale (1986) and Koneru Ashok (2006).
 "Sometimes you need to show that we are still there and I hope this results in positive impetus for many things," Anand said.
 The five-time world champion was expectedly ecstatic about the triumph even though he didn't expect it after server malfunction led to two Indian losses, prompting an appeal from the team.
 Nihal Sarin and Divya Deshmukh lost in the second round of the finale due to disconnection and server malfunction.
 "I didn't anticipate this. I mean clearly the strongest argument in our favour was that this disconnection was not our fault. The rules are clear that if a team loses by disconnection, they forfeit the game.
 "But in this particular case, it was quickly verified that the problem was not at our end. So FIDE had to consider that in our appeal," he said.
 The 50-year-old said he was waiting to be told of a rematch instead.
 "I expected something along the lines of replaying the second match...You know the Russians may not have been happy with this and there would have been discussions. I was expecting a replay.
 "I think then the FIDE opted for the other route, declared both as winners. Look these are teething problems. We are starting online chess, this will not be the last disconnection in online chess. I think this was a fair decision," he said.
 The senior Indian men's team comprised, apart from Anand, Vidit Gujarati (captain), P. Harikrishna and Arvindh Chithambaram (reserves).
 The senior women's side featured Koneru Humpy, Dronavalli Harika, Bhakti Kulkarni and R. Vaishali.
 "It is nice to write their co-tales as well," Anand said. Anand also said that his performance in the event was not great.
 "I was able to rely on the team," he explained.
 He also said it was a good idea to have an online Olympiad this year instead of postponing it amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "The event was a pleasant surprise...The original decision was to move it to next year and then this good idea, I think, to have an online Olympiad. Any sport still has to function, you can't postpone it by a year.
 "I also commend their decision to improvise with the format. So instead of the same format, they got juniors and women, made the event much more fun to watch. It went really nicely."
 Lauding his teammates, Anand said each one of them clicked at some point.
 "During the whole tournament whenever I watched the other boards..some team member somewhere had done something...," he said.
 "Everyone clicked at least in one game. That really worked to the strength of India that we have such depth not only in men, but also women, girls, juniors."
 Asked if the tweaked format helped India, he said: "I think in future it will be nice for India if you can double the number of boards, for instance to showcase our depth.
 "Because we have so many good juniors, so many girls playing. Whether it particularly favoured us, I don't know...nice thing is that if you are putting pressure on all six boards then you could feel someone or the other could click for us. Even when we had one setback, someone could rescue us."
 On whether it was a conscious decision by him to sit out the first game of the final, Anand said he had expressed the desire to play only one game.
 "Yes, it was. I discussed with N Srinath (vice-captain) that I wanted to play only one game on the final day. Because I strongly felt that we had a good team. I thought we had to use that strength.
 "You saw without me the team beat China and that result helped us a lot. So I was happy to repeat that again," he quipped.

 The India-Russia final was said to be widely followed online with over 60,000 viewing it and there were a lot of congratulatory messages flowing in afterwards, which Anand said was a pleasant surprise.
 "Again, it is peculiar to this year that the whole chess world has kind of moved online. It is a positive feeling especially for this generation of youngsters who are part of this winning team."
