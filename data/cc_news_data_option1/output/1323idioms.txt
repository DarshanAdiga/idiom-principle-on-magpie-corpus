"My suggestion is to use existing instruments quickly and effectively" with a three-pronged plan based on the ESM, European Investment Bank and unemployment reinsurance at the EU level, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz Scholz told the Funke newspaper group Friday.
 With a strike force of about 420 billion euros, the ESM provides credit to countries in difficulty, but in exchange, governments must implement belt- tightening and reforms - as was the case for Greece.
 At a summit two weeks ago, Italy and Spain refused this avenue, seeing the conditionality demanded as humiliating -- they would have to agree to external policy oversight -- especially in a health crisis that was not of their own making.
 But Scholz on Friday insisted: "There won't be any senseless conditions as there were sometimes in the past." - European Investment Bank - Germany and the Netherlands have touted other acts of solidarity, including the decision by the EU's executive to suspend deficit and debt rules during the course of the crisis, as well as lift bans on state aid.
 The European Investment Bank, run by the 27 member states, is proposing a pan- European guarantee fund. It would be supported by guarantees from the member states, which would make it possible to mobilise up to an additional 200 billion euros mainly targeted at European small business.
 \- 'Marshall Plan' - The European Commission has proposed a bloc-wide guarantee that could raise 100 billion euros to aid strained national unemployment schemes as millions of jobs are hit by the coronavirus outbreak.
 In the complex scheme, the bloc's 27 national governments would give a temporary budget to Brussels so the EU executive could raise money on the markets to lend to member states struggling to help employees suddenly left without work.
 The commission has also suggested using the EU's long-term budget for 2021 to 2027, currently under negotiation, which could be beefed up to act as a "Marshall Plan" to deal with the crisis.

_#BestOfGT: On this day in 2010, Hope Rush threw her second career no-hitter to help Georgia Tech to a 15-1 win over Virginia Tech. She had already thrown one no-hitter earlier that season in a 5-1 win over North Carolina, and would throw another against the Tar Heels in an 8-0 win on May 15. Rush would finish her career at Georgia Tech second in program history with 79 wins and third with 471 strikeouts._
 Junior Kristine Priebe went 4-for-6 with a home run and six RBI and freshman Hope Rush threw her second career no-hitter as the No. 10/7 Georgia Tech Softball team (31-5, 7-1 ACC) swept Virginia Tech (13-22, 2-6) in a doubleheader Friday night at Mewborn Field. The Yellow Jackets won game one 15-1 in five innings behind the Rush no-hitter and then took game two by a 3-1 score as sophomore Jessica Coan struck out 11.
 The wins clinch the 13th straight ACC series for the Yellow Jackets. Rush (17-3) allowed just one unearned run in her second no-hitter against an ACC team as she walked three and struck out seven. Coan (8-1) was perfect for the first three innings and allowed one run on a solo home run in the fifth. She gave up four hits and one walk to go along with the 11 strikeouts in the complete game effort.
 Junior Christy Jones, sophomore Kelsi Weseman and redshirt senior Jen Yee all had three hits apiece for Georgia Tech. Weseman and Yee each had two doubles and two RBI while Yee was intentionally walked three more times on the night.
 In game one, the Yellow Jackets score in every inning en route to a 15-1 win. Yee led off the first inning with a double and came around to score on a RBI single by Priebe. Freshman Caitlin Jordan also recorded a RBI with a ground out in the inning.
 The second inning saw Virginia Tech pitcher Kenzie Roark strike the first two Tech batters out but the next five all reached base and scored. Junior Christy Jones got it going with an infield single and then Roark walked both Yee and sophomore Kate Kuzma to load the bases. Yee’s walk was her 13th intentional walk of the season. After a two-run single by Weseman made it 4-0, Priebe cleared the bases with a three-run home run to make it a 7-0 game. It was Priebe’s seventh home run of the season.
 Ashton Ward entered the game in relief of Roark in the third inning and gave up two runs on a two-run home run by sophomore Jessica Sinclair, her seventh of the season. Then in the fourth inning, the Yellow Jackets broke the game wide open with six more runs off of Ward. Priebe and Jordan each had RBI singles while Rush added a sac fly. Later in the inning, the Jackets got three more runs on RBI double by sophomore Danielle Dike and two-run double off the bat of Yee.
 Rush gave up just the one unearned run in the top of the fourth inning but still managed to record in her second no-hitter in the last couple of weeks.

NEW YORK -- Global currency fund managers racked up gains in the first quarter as they benefited from the extreme volatility that the coronavirus pandemic has stoked across financial markets.
 The BarclayHedge currency traders index was up 6.13% for the first three months of the year and posted a 2.54% gain for March, according to data the firm posted on Friday, showing results for 42% of the funds it tracks.
 By contrast, the S&P 500 fell 20% in the first quarter in its worst quarterly decline since March 2009, while U.S. crude oil lost 66%.
 Driving the gains in currency funds has been a surge in the market swings that traders need to make money, as expectations of the worldwide coronavirus- fueled slowdown prompted investors to move out of a broad range of currencies and into the U.S. dollar.
 The first quarter followed a long period of sleepy trading in currency markets that had frustrated investors and shuttered numerous funds over the years.
 "March was a period of wild deleveraging, sharp reversals, and extreme moves," said Richard Benson, co-chief investment officer at Millennium Global Investments in London, with $18 billion in assets under management.
 Deutsche Bank's currency volatility index shot up to 16.36 on March 19, its highest level since at least 2012. It now stands at 10.63. In specific currency pairs, such as dollar/yen, the surge was even more significant, hitting levels last seen in November 2008 in the midst of the global financial crisis.
 Many of the market's gyrations have hinged on moves in the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser degree, other haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc.
 The dollar was the foreign exchange market's best performer in the first quarter, notching gains of about 2.6% against a basket of major currencies as economic slowdown fears pushed investors to sell assets across the board and pile into cash.
 The dollar rose 1% last month despite a slew of measures from the Federal Reserve to flood the financial system with greenbacks to address a liquidity crunch caused in part by demand for U.S. currency.
 The Swiss franc and the yen, two other popular destinations for nervous investors, were up 3% and 1% respectively in the first quarter.
 Other currencies saw deep losses. Sharp declines in prices for oil, metals, and other raw materials sparked routs in commodity currencies like the Australian dollar and Norwegian krone, which fell 12% and 18% in the first quarter, respectively.
 Declines in some emerging markets currencies at the end of the March were particularly eye-popping. The Brazilian real fell 23% in the quarter while the Mexican peso slid 20%.
 "In periods like this, you should be long the U.S. dollar, the yen, and Swiss franc and short everything with low liquidity like the Swedish krona, Norwegian krona, and currencies close to global growth like the Australian and Canadian dollars," said Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management in New York.
 BNP Paribas Asset Management's currency program was also up in March, notching 1.5%-2% return on 5% volatility. Long positions in the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen helped BNP's performance, Pojarliev said.
 "If anyone has made money in this environment, it is by being risk averse quite quickly," said Adrian Lee, president and chief investment officer at active currency manager Adrian Lee & Partners, which oversees $12 billion in assets.
 "To some extent, there was a very gradual response to all the information that was coming out of China. So we went risk averse from the end of February and we still are."
 Lee and Millennium's Benson both said their funds gained in March. (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Tom Brown)

The online multiplayer games often took a different path. 2003’s _Resident Evil Outbreak_ was an online PlayStation 2 title that used a traditional approach with old- school campaigns and virus infection mechanics. There hasn’t really been an online game like _Resident Evil Resistance_ , which pits a group of survivors against a single mastermind. The goal is simple enough: escape from a hell house of monsters and traps. What helps _Resistance_ shine is how much control the villainous player has to drop in monsters on the fly or sabotage survivors in the heat of the moment.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration abruptly changed its description of the Strategic National Stockpile, the federal government's repository of life- saving medicines and supplies, to conform with President Donald Trump's insistence that it is only a short-term backup for states, not a commitment to ensure supplies get quickly to those who need them most during an emergency.
 The change, reflected on government websites on Friday, came a day after Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and White House senior adviser who has taken a larger role in the coronavirus response, offered a new argument about the stockpile.
 After saying that states should use their own stockpiles first, Kushner said, "And the notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile. It's not supposed to be states' stockpiles that they then use."
 Until Friday, the federal Health and Human Services website had reflected a markedly different approach to the stockpile. The "Strategic National Stockpile is the nation's largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency severe enough to cause local supplies to run out," the website used to say, according to an archived search.
 "When state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency," the website had said.
 But, according to data, the description changed Friday morning: "The Strategic National Stockpile's role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies. Many states have products stockpiled, as well. The supplies, medicines, and devices for life-saving care contained in the stockpile can be used as a short-term stopgap buffer when the immediate supply of adequate amounts of these materials may not be immediately available."
 Officials at the agency said the change had been in the works for weeks, downplaying any connection to Kushner's comments. Kushner made his claim during his first appearance at the daily White House coronavirus task force briefing, a moment meant to highlight his growing role in managing the federal response to the pandemic, particularly in delivering vital supplies.
 Trump has long insisted that the onus for battling the crisis lies with the states and that Washington is meant to play more of a supporting role. He has resisted calls to issue a national stay-at-home order and said that he didn't want to overly use the Defense Production Act, which allows him to mobilize private companies for the effort, because he believed the states should take the lead in obtaining supplies.

I really wish my students hadn't begun our first online class March 17 with comments like, "You predicted this, I can't believe it, but you predicted it!" And I sort of had -- I began to track the outbreak of what became known as COVID-19 with the students in my class on "The History and Evolution of Infectious Disease" in the third week of January when it first made science news.
   
 Since then we grew frustrated, increasingly alarmed and then horrified as we watched it unfold like a great train wreck that we were powerless to stop.
   
 And I really wish that students from over 20 years ago weren't reaching out to me now, when they hear echoes of my lectures in the news, or to tell me materials from my course provided arguments to shut down schools, or even to call for statewide shelter in place orders.
   
 These aren't compliments. My students are afraid. They are reaching out to me for comfort and support. They've seen it coming, and they know what may happen next.
   
 They've seen the historic data from the Spanish flu of 1918, and its eerie parallels to COVID-19. They've learned their biology, and understand the difference between infectivity and virulence, linear and logarithmic or exponential, and what it means to "flatten the curve."
   
 They've learned a lot about viruses and about mutation and recombination, and accept the fact that evolution is not just part of some abstract theory. It is embodied in the respiratory systems of people with COVID-19 who can't breathe and then just die.
   
 They've studied the common patterns accompanying outbreaks, the suffering, the loss, the scapegoating and the social upheaval, the kind of extreme damage that tears the fabric of even the most civil societies, and often on a global scale.
   
 Microbes, I remind them, don't care about borders or national boundaries, or even at times the rich or the poor. They can be the great levelers, colonizing our bodies and turning us all into "microbial meat." But they also know that each epidemic in history leaves behind a distinct fingerprint -- a kind of signature, if you will -- that is inscribed in collective memory. Every cruel epidemic is cruel, in its own way, to paraphrase Tolstoy.
   
 They know they can prepare for it, and many have, but they also know that it may be futile, if everyone doesn't do it. PowerPoint slide No. 1, or so, in my class points out the obvious: infectious disease is social, by definition. It takes more than one. It thrives on human interactions and co-dependencies, exploiting a basic human need to be with one another.
   
 We are social animals, after all. And they know that whatever we do to come to terms with it, to fight or to adapt, the microbes will find a way to catch up with us.
   
 "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature," isn't just a catchy jingle from a 1970s margarine commercial. It is the theme of the course, a stern reminder that we aren't as smart as we think, and that we have to rethink what we eat, how we live and how we travel, and to do everything we can to preserve the biodiversity of the planet or what's left of it.
   
 We've already eliminated so much of the life on earth, or made it impossible to thrive; we've turned vast rainforests into giant feedlots, to meet the needs of a growing population of human bodies. We've taken the stunning diversity of life on earth and reduced it to a monoculture, on a global scale, a nearly pure cultivated crop of human bodies.
   
 Is it now any surprise that some virus, some opportunistic parasite, is able to take advantage of what is available, namely us, microbial meat?
   
 We've known all this for nearly three decades, especially at the University of Florida where many of us have been sending warning signs to generations of students of the impending train wreck. Powerless to stop it now, we must do what we can to minimize the damage, try to understand what happened and make sure that it does not happen again.
   
 And needless to say, HIS 3495/ZOO 4926, the History and Evolution of Infectious Disease, taught this fall semester (if I survive) is filled to capacity as of today.

Bloomberg) -- The scarcity of safety equipment essential to the coronavirus fight is fueling tensions between longtime transatlantic allies, with local officials in France and Germany accusing unnamed Americans of using unfair means to obtain protective masks.
 Berlin's state interior ministry blamed the U.S. for confiscating 200,000 masks ordered from a U.S. producer when they were in transit through Bangkok. French officials have accused unidentified Americans of paying over the odds to secure masks in China that had already been earmarked for France.
 The U.S. embassy in Paris said any suggestion that the federal government was involved in such practices was "completely false." There was no immediate response the allegations from the White House or the State Department.
 "We view this as an act of modern piracy," Berlin Interior Minister Andreas Geisel said. "You cannot act in such a way among transatlantic partners. Such wild west methods can't dominate, even in a time of global crisis."
 With hundreds of western citizens dying each day, the incidents highlight the fundamental distrust between the U.S. and Europe. It risks hampering efforts to collectively tackle the damage unleashed by a virus that has brought the world's economy to a standstill.
 The degree of suspicion also feeds into a narrative that it's every nation out for itself as Europeans are also viewing with greater skepticism offers of help from Russia and China, wondering if there are strings attached.
 French Prime minister Edouard Philippe said Thursday that his administration has seen orders canceled as a result of the global shortage of protective gear. Some French officials are blaming unidentified Americans for swooping in to outbid them as they try to secure supplies.
 "A load was taken from us by Americans who overbid on a batch that we had identified," Valerie Pecresse, regional president of Paris, told broadcaster LCI Thursday. "We pay on delivery because we want to see the masks, while Americans pay cash and without looking. Of course this is more attractive for those who just seek to turn a profit on the back of the world's distress." She didn't say whether the people involved were federal officials, company representatives or private individuals.
 The pandemic has left governments, companies, charities and individuals around the world competing for scarce supplies of protective kit and medical equipment as health care systems face an unprecedented surge of highly infectious patients with acute, sometimes deadly respiratory problems.
 3M Co. on Friday defended its decision to export respirators from its U.S. facilities to Canada and Latin America, saying there would be "significant humanitarian implications" from halting supplies. President Donald Trump earlier threatened retribution against the company for sending masks and ventilators outside the U.S.
 The head of the Grand Est region in France, Jean Rottner, told RTL radio that his representatives had been outbid by rivals from the U.S. when they were trying to source masks.
 "On the tarmac, Americans take out cash and pay three or four times the price for our orders, so we really have to fight," he said. A spokesman for Rottner declined to comment.
 With the whole world trying to buy masks from China, it's possible that there may have been some "incidents" involving the delivery of orders, an official in the President Emmanuel Macron's office said.
 "The United States government has not purchased any masks intended for delivery from China to France," the U.S. embassy said in an emailed statement. "Reports to the contrary are completely false."
 France has taken delivery of 1.7 billion euros ($1.8 billion) worth of masks already and the volume is set to increase after this week's air shipments arrived as planned, Macron's aide said. The president has promised that France will be able to produce all the masks it needs domestically by the end of the year as the administration works to ramp up production.

TUPELO – Dealing with the loss of a loved one is never easy, but the company of friends and families helps to soothe the emotions.
 But in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, funeral homes have had to adjust their operations to ensure not only the health of grieving loved ones, but also their own employees.
 A coalition of the seven funeral homes in Lee County – Grayson-Porter Mortuary, W.E. Pegues Funeral Directors, Holland Funeral Directors, N.L. Jones Funeral Directors, Lee Memorial Funeral Home, Kesler Funeral Home and Agnew & Sons Funeral Home – issued a joint statement Friday to explain new guidelines in place.
 "We as concerned citizens and the profession of death care providers are fully aware that the COVID-19 pandemic has created a higher health risk," said Whitney Pegues-Beck, president of W.E. Pegues Funeral Directors. "We have been flexible in continuing to meet your death care needs with dignity and sensibility.
 "However, the governor's shelter-in-place order, which we believe is in the best interest of our community and state, will further complicate our offerings."
 The funeral homes have agreed to not allow public visitations. In addition, services will be limited to no more than 10 family members.
 "Please understand our need to protect ourselves, our staff and you," she said. "We understand the importance of services and friends gathering during difficult times of grief, but we have to do our part to stop the spread of this horrible and deadly virus."
 Live streaming of services has been available for years and is being put to more use today, and funeral homes are willing to talk about other options for their services, Pegues-Beck said.
 One idea is to have balloons tied to chairs at a service, representing mourners who are unable to be there.
 Jacque Grayson said the safeguards may be inconvenient, but having funeral directors join together to set one policy is important.
 "This is critical in joining in the fight to stop the spread of coronavirus," she said.
 Response has been mostly positive.
 "At first, they were in disbelief," she said. "Now families are understanding the entire situation. I know it's hard. It's so hard for me to tell a family what they cannot do. I don't like it one bit. But it's not in our control. I love serving and love for the family to do what they want for their loved one. But it's important for me to do the right thing, what's best for them, the best thing for us as our staff, and to the public."
 Steve Holland said he's had some pushback from some as he's told them the new policies.
 "We've struggled with it, but by and large, most families have been understanding," he said. "It's hard because grief can't be quarantined. It's no different when people lose a loved one than it's ever been, but the circumstances are just different now."

BUIES CREEK -- During his four years at Campbell University, Cory Gensler heard Kevin McGeehan say a certain phrase over and over again.
   
 "Pour everything in," Gensler recalled.
   
 Unlike a slew of seniors, the Cary native got the chance for closure on the basketball court before concerns around the coronavirus swept across the nation.
   
 National Student-Athlete Day is set for Monday to recognize players that have achieved success on and off the court or field.
   
 Gensler fits the definition.
   
 "He's been such an unbelievable program guy, as far as just doing everything the right way," said McGeehan, who just completed his seventh season as head coach of the Camels.
   
 "He's been so committed to making himself a great player and being reliable."
   
 Gensler, who was named the Big South Conference's scholar-athlete of the year in men's basketball, compiled a 3.74 GPA as a business administration major and earned spots on the Big South Presidential Honor Roll and all-academic lists.
   
 In addition to that success in the classroom, Gensler finished his four-year career on the court with 72 victories and 133 games played, which are the best marks in program history.
   
 "That's just something I've taken pride in since I got here -- being consistent," Gensler said.
   
 "And just excelling in my role, being that team guy that you can always count on."
   
 The buzzer sounded on Gensler's career at UNC Asheville on March 3 following Campbell's 72-68 loss in the Big South Conference tournament.
   
 Over 126 starts and 4,123 minutes, Gensler drained 192 3-pointers, nabbed 141 steals and finished 23rd on the all-time scoring list with 1,006 points.
   
 "He's made the most of his college basketball career by being an everyday guy," McGeehan said. "You root for guys like that because they're not all like that.
   
 "That's what programs are built on. Every year there's turnover. … He's just been so reliable and other guys follow that. They follow the approach, they follow the toughness, they follow the reliability. That helps everybody get better."
   
 The moment that sticks out the most, Gensler said, is when Campbell won the 2018-19 Big South regular-season title at Gore Arena.
   
 "That was a really important moment for this program and just a really fun day," he recalled.
   
 "It's been a lot of fun. It's been a really special four years. I've been through a lot with this program. … I really enjoyed my time here."
   
 As for everything off the court, including his grades and work in the community, Gensler never shied away from the importance of those things.
   
 "That stuff always comes first," he said.
   
 "My mom's a teacher and that's just how it's always been in my family. Just going about everything the right way in the community, in the classroom and being someone that embodies what being a student-athlete is all about."
   
 In that regard, McGeehan "never had to worry about one minute" with Gensler, pointing to Gensler's "good base," work ethic and daily approach.
   
 "I think he's going to be successful in whatever he decides to do in life," McGeehan said.
   
 "No doubt about it. He'll be a good husband, a good father, a good friend. He's the kind of guy you want to have, and if you can find 'em, they do a lot for you. On a personal level, I feel like I'm a better coach because of what he's been able to bring to our program.
   
 It's safe to say Gensler was able to "pour everything in" during his time in Buies Creek. And that's the message he leaves to the players that come after him.
   
 "Give it everything you have," he said. ". … Once it's over, it's over. You can't get any of this time back."

RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT) - Engaged couples across the country are reinventing their weddings, as the pandemic is forcing people to stay apart, even on one of the most special of days. Richmond newlyweds Ian and Danica Lovern just transformed their entire ceremony, streaming it on Instagram live to hundreds of their guests.After a picture-perfect engagement last September, the pair solidified their big day for April 11. The ceremony was set for Blue Bee Cidery. All the vendors were booked and paid. Every detail was arranged with attentive care.“Everything, down to even my engagement ring, has been very, very thoughtful,” said Danica, during a Zoom interview with NBC12, while still wearing her breathtaking wedding dress.After the global pandemic forced Governor Ralph Northam to limit crowds to fewer than 10 people in March, Danica and Ian faced a painful decision."We canceled about two weeks ago,” she said. “In that short period of time, we had to figure out… how is it possible for us to still get married?”So, with a bit of adjusting and letting go of the expected, Danica said they pivoted to a barebones ceremony of four people. "It's been a really emotional two weeks,” she said.Ian and Danica created their alter at the top of Libby Hill Park, a block away from their apartment, picking the spot the night before. After waiting for a truck to clear out, Danica made her way to Ian and their reverend, while a favorite love song played from Ian’s cell phone. The pair pledged their vows, streaming the nuptials for nearly 300 of their closest family and friends (and probably some random viewers) on Instagram live.“Yesterday, my mom did a test run on Instagram,” Danica said. “I think a lot of (our guests) understand that we did this for their well-being, as well as their loved ones and their loved ones, and so on.”Champagne toasts, first dances and wedding photos were taken at the most familiar of places, the couple’s apartment.“I think this is the best thing we could have imagined,” said Danica. “At the end of the day, it’s about the love and the celebration of your relationship and partnership that you have with that person... and whether there’s 500 people or two people there to celebrate with you, that’s what important.”Danica and Ian said all of their vendors were also very accommodating, offering to adjust in any way they could or refund their money.Copyright 2020 WWBT.

 Jake Adams earned himself a place alongside Babe Ruth, Jim Thorpe, Calvin Koonce and others by producing a special memory in Fayetteville's baseball history a year ago today.
   
 The former Big Ten Conference Player of the Year helped make the long-awaited debut of the Fayetteville Woodpeckers a rousing success in Woodbridge, Virginia, with a four-for-six, seven-RBI hitting performance that led to a 15-0 victory against the Potomac Nationals. Highlighting the evening for the Woodpeckers and Adams was his fourth-inning, grand-slam home run over the highest sign above the left-field wall at Pfitzner Stadium.
   
 "I've had some big games throughout my career, but I think that's one of the top five,'' Adams said earlier this week in a telephone interview from his home in Brandon, South Dakota. "But that may have actually been the best game in pro ball that I've had. For it to be the opening game for Fayetteville, and have it play out like that was very special.''
   
 The day capped a build-up of anticipation that started in December 2016 when the Houston Astros signed a 30-year lease agreement with Fayetteville to house its Advanced Class A minor league franchise. The team had to play its first two seasons at Campbell University's home field 30 minutes away in Buies Creek while a new $30 million stadium was constructed in the heart of Fayetteville's downtown.
   
 The finishing touches were being put on Segra Stadium as the Woodpeckers took the field for the first time in Woodbridge, where minor league baseball was actually coming to an end. The Nationals had already announced a move to Fredericksburg, Virginia for 2020 and were playing their final season at Pfitzner Stadium, which explained the small crowd present on a chilly spring evening for the opener.
   
 Adams, a first baseman, had finished the 2018 season in Buies Creek, where he helped the Astros win the Carolina League championship. His game-tying home run in the eighth forced extra innings in the title game, which Buies Creek eventually won 2-1 against Potomac.
   
 Spring training had been a struggle for Adams, who was revamping his swing. He collected just one hit - that one coming in a spring exhibition game with the major league club - before reporting to Fayetteville to start the 2019 season.
   
 "I was changing my swing a complete 360, so I was kind of mentally prepared for the struggles that were going to happen in the spring,'' Adams said. "I was just trying to get my timing right and the mechanics down. Going into opening day everybody was jacked up and ready to get out and there and start competing. I just went out there and tried to have fun.''
   
 The first time up against Potomac, however, Adams' spring training woes continued as he struck out. "I'm a power hitter, so I know I'm going to strike out,'' he said. "I think I swung at a couple of bad pitches, so I really got myself out. But you can't beat yourself up much after the first at bat of the season.''
   
 Adams would snap out of his slump in spectacular fashion with his next four at bats. He belted a pitch so hard off the left-field wall that he was held to a two-RBI single in the third inning to put the Woodpeckers ahead 4-0. The right-handed slugger then came to the plate again in the top of the fourth, this time with the bases loaded.
   
 Former University of North Carolina pitcher A.J. Bogucki entered the game for Potomac in relief and quickly ran the count to 1-1 against Adams.
   
 "I think I did take one big hack and missed,'' Adams said. "I had to step out and kind of settle myself down a little bit. I'm a power guy so if I put a pretty good swing on it, it's going to go regardless. So I just calmed down and waited for my pitch. And I got it.''
   
 Adams crushed a slider from Bogucki high over the left-field wall for a grand slam, giving him six RBIs in the game. He would later add another RBI single to left field.
   
 "I think that game gave our (Fayetteville) fans something to look forward to when we got home,'' Adams said.
   
 Of course, the Woodpeckers would play 13 more road games while Segra Stadium was being completed before debuting there before a crowd of 6,202 on April 18.
   
 Adams went on to become one of Fayetteville's most popular players and top hitters. He hit .246 with a team-best 15 homers and 66 RBIs to earn Carolina League all-star honors before being promoted to Class AA Corpus Christi in August. Adams continued his strong hitting there, cracking seven homers and driving in 21 runs in 27 games.
   
 Now, like everyone else around the world, Adams is confined to home in Brandon due to the COVID-19 outbreak that led to the cancellation of spring training and had put the 2020 baseball season in jeopardy. He's still finding places to work out and spending time with his new wife, Lexi. The pair were married last November.
   
 If the 2020 season is played, Adams expects to start out again at Class AA Corpus Christi. But he'll never forget the time spent in Buies Creek and Fayetteville.
   
 "I'm always going to remember those two places because they are very special to me,'' Adams said. "Winning a championship in Buies Creek, then helping get things started in Fayetteville and with the new stadium were special things to experience.''

Family & Community Services, Inc., operates several shelters which, as Gov. Mike DeWine recently pointed out, aren't built for social distancing.  
 That's why Mark Frisone, director of the agency, said he's been meeting with county emergency planners to determine the best way to protect residents of the shelters from COVID-19, before the first case of coronavirus was ever diagnosed in Portage County.  
 "Even when the rest of the world grinds to a halt, we're still in business," he said.  
 The governor addressed shelters in a recent press briefing, acknowledging that many are not built for social distancing. Other residential facilities, including sober living houses and group homes, also have groups of people in close quarters, DeWine added.  
 Family & Community Services operates several shelters in Portage County, including Safer Futures, Miller Community House and Freedom House, which accommodates veterans. It also operates facilities for people in recovery, Portage Area Recovery Center and On Track to Recovery houses in Kent and Root House in Ravenna. The agency also operates food pantries in Kent and Ravenna, and provides transportation through Emerald Transportation.  
 Michelle Madden, chief operating officer at Independence of Portage County, said the agency has 43 beds in its six group homes.  
 Both agencies have policies to protect its residents.  
 Frisone said his agency is represented in countywide planning groups, and works closely with the Portage County Health District, whose offices are in the same building.  
 Residents at the facilities have their temperatures taken twice each day, he said. They limit who goes in and out of the facilities and there are no visitors allowed. Personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves, are provided to residents and staff.  
 Because all of the facilities are too small for a person with symptoms to self-isolate, people are removed from the facilities at the first sign of an illness. He said there are two such residents who are being isolated. One, he said, is at an apartment that his agency operates. Another resident is being housed at a hotel room.  
 "Their bed will be waiting for them when they come back," he said.  
 Madden said if a resident of one of those group homes develops symptoms, the policy states that the resident should be separated from other residents, wearing personal protective equipment should they leave their bedroom. The agency, she said, also has policies allowing employees to self-isolate themselves at home should they be ill or exposed to the virus.  
 "The well-being and safety of the individuals we serve and our staff is our number one priority," she said. "While there is still much that is unknown about COVID-19, we understand that it is thought to be most easily spread from person-to-person via respiratory droplets among close contacts.We are taking extraordinary precautions and following all applicable guidance to protect, as much as possible, the individuals we serve and our staff from the COVID-19 virus."  
 She said the precautions include limiting interactions between residents who are most at risk, regularly monitoring staff and residents for signs of infection, using the early screening process for all staff for coronavirus symptoms, restricting visitors from coming into the homes, cleaning and sanitizing homes each day, and requiring staff to use personal protective equipment when working with residents who have any symptoms.  
 Frisone said some shelters in Ohio have closed their doors because of the pandemic, which he said he finds that "astonishing." He said that won't happen in Portage County, because the agency's services are "critically needed in our community."  
 "Feeding people, housing people and moving people, those are basic needs," he said.
