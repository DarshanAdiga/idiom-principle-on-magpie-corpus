Luke Roberts, the 2019-2020 STAR student for Ingomar High School, has selected Tabitha Dillard as STAR teacher of the year.


  Roberts was selected as the school’s 2020 STAR (Student-Teacher Achievement Recognition) student for the 2019-2020 school year by the Mississippi Economic Council’s M. B. Swayze Foundation, sponsor of the STAR program.


  In addition to being named the STAR student, Roberts was inducted into the Ingomar High School Hall of Fame, was elected as student body vice president as a junior and a student body president as a senior. He has also been a member of the varsity basketball team for four years, including during its recent win of the Class 1A state championship. He was named Scholar Athlete for the championship game. He has also been a member of the varsity cross country team since he was in the 7th grade and has been named to the all- county team and all-division team four times and the all-state team two times.


  Roberts has also been involved in the Union County Theatre club, where he has participated in the productions of The Addams Family Musical, Cinderella, Big Fish and Grease. He has also been a member of the Future Business Leaders of America, Students against Destructive Decisions, the math club, science club and student council.


  In his spare time, Roberts enjoys hanging out with friends, running on his own, spending time with his family and working with animals. He is currently an animal care technician at the Tupelo-Lee Humane Society..


  Roberts advised his fellow seniors to not doubt themselves.


  “Over the many years we’ve had together I’ve seen first hand how amazing everyone of y’all is,” Roberts said. “Y’all can do anything you put your minds to. I know we are living in a tough time right now, but always be positive and never doubt or give up on yourself.”


  He also encouraged other students at Ingomar to cherish every second of high school.


  “I know it sounds cliché, and you have heard it 100 times, but it is true high school really is over in the blink of an eye,” Roberts said. “Nothing is for certain. The class of 2020 did not know that our last day of high school would be on March 5 and if we did, we would have cherished those last memories a little more. So never take anything or granted and enjoy every second because these truly are the best years of your life.”


  Roberts said he will be attending the University of Louisiana-Monroe to major in pre-pharmacy. In seven years, he hopes to graduate with a PharmD and begin work as a retail pharmacist.


  Roberts is the son of Kenneth and Jenifer Roberts and has one sister, Sydney Roberts.


  Dillard, who currently teaches high school English at Ingomar, has a bachelor's degree in curriculum and instruction in secondary English education from Blue Mountain College, a masters degree in curriculum and instruction with a focus in Secondary English from the University of Mississippi, a specialist degree in educational leadership from Arkansas State University and a National Board Certification in adolescence and young adulthood in English.


  The STAR teacher was first hired at South Pontotoc Attendance Center, where she taught junior high creative writing and high school English for three years. She then transferred to North Pontotoc for one year to teach high school English and was hired to teach at Ingomar in 2007.


  Over the last 13 years of teaching at Ingomar, Dillard has taught junior high reading, English 1, English II, English IV, world literature, Mississippi writers and oral communication. She also served as the yearbook sponsor for five years, as well as the Beta Club and blood donor coordinator.


  Dillard said she has found success in the classroom by modeling the work she expects from her students.


  “It's easy to tell students what they should do, but if they can't see it, they normally don't understand,” Dillard said. “Furthermore, since most of my students are visual learners, I color code during most lessons. For example, I teach students to include specific information in the body paragraph of an essay. Before having them write their own, I project one I have written and highlight each required part a different color. I may highlight the topic sentence yellow, the two points blue, all textual evidence pink, the commentary purple, and the concluding sentence orange. Once students finish writing their own, they check for the same information by highlighting each part of their paragraph using the same colors as I did in mine. If they see only one area in blue, then they realize they must add one more point. If they have no purple, they see they did not explain any of their evidence. My students have told me many times how much seeing my writing and then color coding their own helps them to be successful.”


  Dillard said Roberts, whom she taught during his freshman and sophomore years, had told her during his junior year that, if he were named STAR student, he would choose her as STAR teacher.


  “I smiled, told him how sweet he was, and thanked him,” she said. “Then, a couple of months ago, he stopped by my classroom and asked if I remembered him saying that to me. I told him that I did. He then confirmed that he was named STAR student and that he was choosing me as his STAR teacher. He said he felt like I was responsible for helping him achieve a high score on the English and reading portions of the ACT and he thanked me. I was so excited for him, and I was all smiles the rest of the day.”


  She went on to praise Roberts for his hard work.


  “Luke Roberts is an intelligent young man who worked diligently to earn this honor,” she said. “I may have planted a seed, but Luke's achievement resulted primarily from his own hard work and determination. It does a teacher's heart good to hear students say 'Thank you' and 'I wouldn't have done as well without you. I feel privileged that Luke chose me as his STAR teacher. It makes my heart smile. More importantly, it makes me feel appreciated, and for that, I thank Luke.”

The novel coronavirus lockdown has been a traumatic experience for many cricketers and teams will have to change their approach to mental health when the game resumes, mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton has said.
 Cricket, the South African added, does not have a good track record of managing players’ mental health, which is likely to suffer as the game’s suspension drags on.
 “Every player might have gone through their own ‘trauma cycle’ after the coronavirus suddenly pulled the rug out from under their feet,” Upton, who worked with India’s 2011 World Cup-winning team said.
 “It’s not dissimilar to an athlete suffering an injury and being forced to sit out for months. It’s about having to deal with not being able to play or train. Now there are also issues such as not being able to go outdoors.”
 United Nations health experts have warned of a looming mental illness crisis, with millions surrounded by death and disease and forced into isolation, poverty and anxiety.
 Cricket, like most sports, ground to a halt in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the future of this year’s marquee tournaments such as the Indian Premier League (IPL) and Twenty20 World Cup in Australia hangs in the balance.
 Upton said some players could benefit from the enforced break but others were struggling with financial worries and the emotional stress of being cut off from the game and their team mates.
 “Attention to players’ mental health in good times is not that comprehensive and we’re going through an unprecedented time where a number have gone through various emotional and mental turmoil,” he added.
 “If in good times there’s very little support to manage their mental struggles, I imagine at this stage it would be exacerbated. We don’t really know how well players are coping behind closed doors.”
 The International Cricket Council is exploring ways to restart matches, but Upton believes the suspension could last several more months.
 “I don’t see us playing cricket for a fair number of months,” the 51-year-old said. “International travel isn’t open and it doesn’t look like it’ll change in the immediate future.”
 When the game does resume, only teams who adapt to the post-COVID-19 landscape will thrive, added Upton, the former Performance Director of Cricket South Africa.
 “I think some athletes need more support than ever before,” he said. “They’re not dealing with performance pressures but there are personal pressures.
 “Smart teams are going to sit down and figure out the new dynamics. I guarantee whenever the World Cup comes along, you’ll have teams who figure out the psychology of this post-COVID existence. They will be set up to perform better.”

The University of Missouri could see a 25 percent decline in revenue if the coronavirus forces another shut-down of in-person instruction and students are sent home from campus housing, a worst-case budget scenario given to the Board of Curators shows.


   


  Two other scenarios, one with an almost-normal fall and spring semester and another where students are sent home for part of a semester as the university resumes online-only learning. Those outcomes would mean revenue falls 3 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively.


   


  "I think our best-case scenario is the most unlikely of the three we went through today," Vice President for Finance Ryan Rapp said.


   


  Rapp used references to the actions taken during the Great Depression, including a 38 percent cut to payroll from salary cuts and layoffs, to show that decisive action will help prepare the university for the worst-case scenario.


   


  The board met via Zoom in a special meeting to discuss budget, enrollment and other issues in advance of a June meeting where curators would normally set a spending plan for the coming year and set tuition rates.


   


  The pandemic forced the four campuses to shut down in-person learning in mid- March, a move that was followed by directing most personnel to work from home.


   


  System President and interim MU Chancellor Mun Choi reiterated that the university is planning to go online if necessary but is working as though classes will start as normal. A task force will work on setting a program for testing students and isolating them if necessary.


   


  "People very much want to see the university back in business and the students back here," curator Robin Wennecker of Columbia said.


   


  The revenue hits so far include a $37 million cut in state support and refunds of room-and-board and activity fees totaling almost $30 million. To mitigate those revenue declines, the system has made layoffs and furloughs, cut administrative salaries and asked employees to take voluntary cuts.


   


  Each campus is planning to cut at least 12.5 percent from its budget.


   


  Non-payroll spending has been cut $30 million over April 2019 levels, Rapp said.


   


  The UM System is operating under a $3.4 billion budget for the fiscal year that ends June 30. Of that amount, about $1 billion is for MU Health Care and $1.4 billion is for operations of the Columbia campus.


   


  As they plan for the year that begins July 1, some curators signaled that they want to operate within revenues, and tuition rates that charge the same for online and in-person instruction are unacceptable.


   


  "I am not sure I can be a yes vote on a budget that is going to operate out of reserves," curator Greg Hoberock said.


   


  University officials are planning for an almost-normal fall semester, with students in residence halls in normal densities and in-person instruction. It would be difficult and expensive to limit dorm rooms to single occupancy, President and interim MU Chancellor Mun Choi said.


   


  A one-person-per-room limit would mean finding housing for about 5,000 students, Choi said.


   


  "We are not sure the community is able to handle that additional influx into the community," he said.


   


  The enrollment picture across the system is mixed. Undergraduate registrations are up 15 percent at the Columbia campus and down 4.9 to 17.2 percent at the other three campuses. The opposite is true for graduate student acceptances, which are up 38.3 percent at Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla and lesser amounts at University of Missouri-St. Louis and University of Missouri-Kansas City.


   


  Graduate student acceptances are down 1.3 percent in Columbia.


   


  Registrations by first-time students who recently graduated high school is up 1.6 percent in Columbia and 3.2 percent on the Rolla campus and down in Kansas City and St. Louis.


   


  Administrators are considering a modest tuition increase, Choi said. The amount could be equal to inflation, 2.3 percent in 2019, to as much as 3.5 percent, he said.


   


  "Any increase will be based on actual need we have at the university," Choi said.


   


  Under state law, tuition increases are limited to the change in prices generally due to inflation, except when state funding is cut. When the state reduces support, as it did this year, higher education institutions in Missouri are allowed to add an additional increase of up to 5 percent.


   


  The tuition increase will be to provide new money for priorities, not cover budget shortfalls, Choi said.


   


  "This university has never been in the position of asking parents and students to account for a lack of revenue coming to the university," Choi said.


   


  The board should consider whether it can use pricing to encourage online learning, curator David Steelman of Rolla said. The budget and tuition decisions should not be made quickly because they will have a significant impact on the future of the university, he said.


   


  Another reason for considering different tuition for online and in-person instruction is the expectations of families that they are paying full price for a complete college experience, Hoberock said.


   


  "I cannot in good faith charge our parents and our students the full price of face-to-face learning if it is going to be done remotely or online," he said.
