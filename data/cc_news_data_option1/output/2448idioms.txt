Step one was something that seems uncontroversial today: Pao wanted to ban the nonconsensual posting of sexual pictures of former partners, aka revenge porn. It wasn't yet illegal in any U.S. states but bills banning it were on the way. (It's still not illegal in some of them). Pao was simply ahead of the curve.

And of course, millions of everyday African citizens did their part, too. Many stayed indoors, halting the normal rhythms of their lives at great personal cost. Some struggled to get prescriptions refilled or receive routine health care. Others lost jobs and income. But so far, the continent has by and large averted disaster.

Adesso indaga la Procura di Parma, che ha aperto ufficialmente una inchiesta. La famiglia di Marotta sostiene invece con forza che il tutto sia da attribuire alla eccessiva violenza mostrata da parte delle forze dell'ordine. "Lo hanno ammanettato con la forza, immobilizzandolo in maniera violenta. Questo è un abuso di potere proprio come quanto accaduto negli Stati Uniti con George Floyd". La vittima era originaria di Salerno e dopo la scomparsa della moglie era andato ad abitare in Emilia dove si trova da tempo sua figlia, che ha un lavoro stabile e ha messo su famiglia. Lui poteva anche passare molto tempo con i suoi nipotini. Il genero della vittima protesta all'Ansa. "Quel che è accaduto è inspiegabile. Gli agenti lo hanno immobilizzato ed ammanettato con la forza, fino a soffocarlo una volta costretto a terra".

Ironically, their efforts to take it down have only led to more visibility for it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Meyers said he and his son decided to install a security camera near the sign after someone attempted to take it down, capturing multiple acts of vandalism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "We couldn't believe that someone would actually steal the sign," he said. "So then we put up the cameras. And to see the hatred — one guy with a knife, one guy practically ripping our fence down, two separate guys with spray paint — it's sickening."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And while the situation has left him disheartened, Meyers said he was "far more encouraged by the countless young adults who are becoming activists and agents for positive change, especially my son."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Despite the damage to the sign, Meyers said he was grateful to the sheriff's department for being forthcoming with the arrests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "The sheriff's office does an amazing job — this is one of the safest communities in the US," he said. "It's been so impressive that he stood up, identified one of the vandals as someone in his office, and acted on it immediately. That says so much. I think we all look forward to putting this behind us and moving on to a tomorrow where everyone is treated equally and with the respect that we all deserve."

Mass gatherings are still banned, meaning professional sport will have to be played in front of empty stadia for the time being, with no timetable for when fans can return.

I also knew that teams wanted to show their support, as well. Until we started walking and I could see every driver there, looked back and saw each team jump off the wall and fall in line. Then to go back to the rain delay, first thing I did was looked at the phone and saw the photos. To see how many people were on pit road showing their support for Bubba, that warmed me up tremendously.

Elsewhere, a real sense we've turned a corner this morning with reports that fine cultural pursuits like going to the theatre, watching a film at the cinema and smashing pints in car parks that have been converted into beer gardens should be on the cards from 4 July. Gordon Rayner has the full story and there's some more on the car park / beer garden plan from Harry Yorke here.

This was a time when grandchildren were beginning to be the joy of their life. Hazel found the need to move on and moved to Central Valley - now known as Shasta Lake City. She bought a home and found a job at an art gallery in the Mt Shasta Mall. Two years later she married Orval "Buck" Gendron. They were perfect companions and spent a number of years traveling between Shasta Lake and Arizona with other friends and snow birds. Buck became ill in 2005 and Hazel once again found herself a widow. With the majority of her family living in the Redding area there was no time to just sit. Her favorite pastime was sports. Her monthly calendars had very few empty days. You could find her in the stands at all of her grandchildren's games plus many of the local Central Valley High and Shasta College games.

Canobie Lake Park in Salem is getting ready to open its doors on July 16, with reservations only, a 25% capacity limit and other social distancing and cleaning guidelines.
 Chris Nicoli, the park’s brand manager, said the experience will likely be very different from what visitors are used to, with shorter lines, spaced-out queues and seating on roller coasters, and some rides unavailable at certain times.
 “The product is definitely going to look differently this year,” Nicoli said.
 Staff members will wear masks. Nicoli said it is likely that guests will be required to wear masks, at least at the start of the season.
 He said the park may create a new daily update web page, since rules and ride availability are likely to change day by day.
 “This is our path forward to be able to do anything,” Nicoli said.
 Social distancing is not expected to be a problem.
 “One of the unique things about us is the space,” Nicoli said.
 He said the 65 acres of property at Canobie make it easier to ensure social distancing, and even with the customer capacity restricted to 25%, the park can still serve thousands at a time.
 Amusement parks are allowed to open in the state as early as June 29, but Nicoli said a park of Canobie’s size needed more time to get ready.
 Almost no one has been at the facility for about three months, and Nicoli said staffers have been doing virtual meetings from their homes, with a very minimal staff presence at the park.
 “Everyone … is very excited to be back on property,” Nicoli said.
 The park is working to bring seasonal staff on board. Nicoli said they expect the number will be a little less than a normal year. Some workers — such as street performers and costumed characters who would normally interact with kids — will instead enforce social distancing and sanitize rides, he said.
 “This is not going to be a great year, but we can survive it as long as we have the opportunity to do the safe, smaller openings,” Nicoli said.
 “We’ve been around over 100 years; we plan on being around another 100 years. Decades from now, it will be another blip on the radar.”
 He said the purpose of the park isn’t just to make money, but to give folks a way to have fun, create memories and forget about the outside world for a bit.
 “And I think a lot of people need that right now,” Nicoli said.
 Hudson resident Brett Parker, who has gone to the park since he was a kid and has been bringing his family to the park multiple times a year, said he remains concerned about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the numbers he’s seeing.
 “Me and my family will be sitting out this year regardless of the precautions,” Parker said.
 Still, Parker said he wishes the park well, and as a business owner he is sympathetic to the park’s need to reopen.

Smile and the world smiles with you, so they say. But that's easier said than done when our faces are concealed beneath a mask. A joyful expression tends to be one of the harder facial expressions to read when our mouth is covered, primarily because we grow up learning that a smile is the main indicator of happiness.

The central concept behind Shipbreaker is fairly self-explanatory if the name isn’t very memorable. Your job is to salvage old spaceships, grabbing everything that's not nailed down. After that, you’ll start ripping out the space nails and taking the ship apart at the seams, selling the raw materials for an even bigger profit. You only have a set number of shifts to dismantle each ship, as well as oxygen and fuel you’ll have to restock every once in a while, which can encourage you to cut corners and rush through some of the technical cutting. That is not advised though, as spaceships are filled with all kinds of dangers that can get your cutter killed. Forgetting to de-pressure a ship might launch you into space, and more importantly, it might rip the ship apart and destroy a lot of its value. Accidentally cutting through a fuel line or power cell without properly disengaging them might also lead to an equally large explosion. And to make matters a little more interesting, each ship has a slightly different layout, forcing you to always keep aware of what exactly your cutting apart with your lasers.

Non è ancora chiara la dinamica dell'accaduto. Risulterebbe che la Stradale abbia fermato Marotta per un normale controllo. In passato l'uomo era stato sorpreso al volante senza cintura di sicurezza per più volte. Durante la compilazione del verbale il 63enne si sarebbe scagliato con rabbia contro gli agenti, spingendoli via. E come riporta la Questura di Parma, i poliziotti lo hanno immobilizzato a terra. Appena visto che era diventato pallido però hanno provveduto a chiamare i soccorsi. Il 118 ha fornito loro via telefono le procedure da seguire, ma tutto è risultato inutile ed i tentativi di rianimare Marotta non sono serviti a niente.

Many turning points ensued over the course of that YCombinator year. It took a surprisingly long time for Huffman and Ohanian to arrive at the name Reddit; for the longest time they wanted to call their site Snoo, as in "what's new." But the first key feature turned out to be a combination of the upvote and downvote — subtly different from "liking" or "disliking" a story, this merely indicated whether a user thought it was important enough that others read it — and the "karma" points you'd receive for upvotes on links you posted. (Ohanian posted the first story, and Huffman, true to form, immediately downvoted it.)

"Not a bad run for our Fastenal Ford Mustang and our team," Buescher said in a post-race interview on social media. "Lots of excitement throughout the race at different areas and I obviously wanted to replay the end to do a little bit better. At the end of the day, it was a good run for us.

In the past several years the town has provided less and less detail for more and more spending. Does this make sense? Without details and breakdowns how does a well-informed voter determine what amounts in the budget maybe too high or maybe too low?
 In this day and age of electronic data and spreadsheets, coupled with the town’s website for distribution, it all fits together and can provide enormous amounts of organized information. This happens if, and only if, the town truly wants the citizens to know how their money is being spent. The town continues to drag its feet, hide, bob and weave, fake left and cut right, and go deeper into the rabbit hole to provide timely information. The town enjoys watching you sit in the chair, without Novocain, while you pull your own teeth.

That means that when you encounter a sharp stock market sell-off -- like in February-March -- you should generally "stay the course" with stocks and avoid the temptation to sell at a steep loss. It is also a good idea to gradually rebalance, which means selling fixed income that has maintained its value and buying stocks at lowered prices to help you get back to your long-term asset allocation.

Governor of Kaduna state, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, refused to be Omokri’s ATM as narrated with email evidence by Mohammed Salihu in a July 2011 article. And since then Omokri has made it a mission to attack and traduce El-Rufai. He has taken on a self-appointed mission of ensuring that El-Rufai doesn’t become the president of Nigeria in 2023. This jingoist of region and religion, with a past of forgery and a present of incitement has tried to attribute every failing under the sun to El-Rufai or his family members, in bid to get settled.

The security challenges across much of the north have been in the news. Attacks by bandits in many parts of the Northwest are reported for the criminal actions that they are, but Reno’s circle of bigots will report similar attacks in parts of Kaduna state as an ethno-religious issue, once the victims are not Hausa-Fulani or Muslim. El-Rufai has done everything humanly possible to ensure the security of lives and property, including creating a Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs to coordinate the state government response to the security challenges. If truly Omokri is a man of God, he ought to have acknowledged that the security challenges are not limited to Southern Kaduna, but the entire country, unfortunately. And if Omokri has any conscience, he owes the religious right the duty of educating them, rather than solidifying their hate.

Then the dam burst. In October 2017, with a _New Yorker_ reporter as witness, Reddit formed a "war room" to take down more than a hundred subreddits that went beyond the pale — including r/KKK, r/killallJews, and r/sexwithdogs. These were tiny subreddits, mere flies in the giant Reddit soup, but the fact that they existed at all showed how absurdly tolerant Huffman and his successors had been of the most abhorrent forms of free speech. The awkward young programmer, once drawn to a vague form of libertarianism and trollish behavior, had finally been shocked into growing up.

Chairman Daniel Levy had said earlier in the lockdown period that he hoped players would follow suit as club staff took pay cuts, those below board level eventually not having to after a u-turn on using the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme funds.
 Some Premier League players have already taken wage cuts to help out their clubs. Down the road at Arsenal, a "voluntary agreement" from the players and management staff saw their annual earnings reduced by 12.5 per cent.
 It is understood that at Tottenham, those involved are waiting until the end of the season to ascertain the full picture of how much the club have been hit by the lack of income.
 Mourinho was asked whether he would be willing to take a wage cut if necessary.
 "I am with my club and I am with my players. The decision of my club and my players are my decisions, always. Always. So with me, zero problems," he said.

It needs to be pointed out that the sentiments of black people towards Filipinos during the US colonial period were divided, as argued by Ingrid Dineen-Wimberly. For some blacks, US expansion in the Philippines opened a gateway for “upward mobility while they subverted domestic racism.” T. Thomas Fortune, a mixed-race and black-identified newspaper editor and prominent leader in the Afro-American business community who served as Special Agent to the Philippines from 1902 to 1903, saw potential for African Americans in the context of the US occupation. Fortune advocated for black emigration in the Philippines, arguing that African Americans would be able to supply the labor that was needed in the Philippines while pursuing liberty and happiness in the rich and fertile islands.

Hazel will be remember fondly by family and friends of her many talents. She was an artist, writer, historian, knitter - but most of all a mother and grandmother. Her love of history of the Klamath River area and Native American Karuk tribe was well known. She co-authored 4 issues of Siskiyou Pioneer through the Siskiyou County Historical Society. She was a newspaper reporter for the Siskiyou Daily News, Pioneer Press, Humboldt Times and Medford Tribune. In 2000 she started her "The Project of My Heart" to restore her great grandfather Ezra Tanner name to local landmarks. After 1960 the name Tanner was misprinted on area maps and signs with the name Tannen. She spent two years of research, documentation and letter writing. In 2002 she was the honored guest at the Bend Oregon Board of Geographic Board meeting where it was voted unanimously to approve the restoration of the name to Tanner Lake, Tanner Mountain and two creeks.

Mr Johnson slashed the social distancing rule, a measure which will allow businesses to get more customers through their doors.
 He detailed how pubs, bars and restaurants can start gradually to re-open from July 4, saying the number of new Covid-19 infections is declining by between two and four per cent each day. He also confirmed that hairdressers can reopen with barbers told to wear masks.
 He said soft play areas, gyms, bowling alleys and water parks will be among places that will have to remain closed for the time being.
 He said: "This pandemic has inflicted permanent scars and we mourn everyone we have lost.
 "We do not believe there is currently a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS.
 "We no longer face a virus spreading exponentially although it remains in general circulation. All parts of the UK are now travelling in the same direction.
 "We can now go further and safely ease the lockdown in England. At every stage caution will remain our watchword.
 "We can change the 2m social distancing rule from the 4th of July."

China fully supports African countries’ efforts against Covid-19, and pledges to continue assisting Africa with supplies and medical experts and accelerate the construction of African CDC. China promises that once the Covid-19 vaccine is completed and put into use, African countries will be the first in line to benefit from it. China is willing to work together with the international community to step up support for African countries, particularly those that are hardest hit by the coronavirus and are under heavy financial stress, by such means as further extending the period of debt suspension, to help them tide over the current difficulty.

The UK had been an outlier in not using the Apple/Google model, with a number of other nations - including Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the Republic of Ireland - all using the software built by the tech giants.
 Tackled over the cost of the "technical fiasco" to taxpayers in the House of Lords, Lord Bethell said the amount to date was £11.8 million.
 Pressing the Government over the volte-face, Liberal Democrat peer Lord Clement-Jones highlighted the anger felt at the "sheer incompetence and lack of humility" over the NHSX debacle.
 He said: "It's go it alone approach and attempt to shift the blame onto tech companies simply won't wash.
 "Isn't it time the Government just accepted the fact that we can't develop our own app and go straight to adopt the available interface... behind the off- the-shelf, decentralised app now in widespread use and introduced in Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Denmark where they appear to be working well."

As for the $1 trillion infrastructure-spending proposal, bear in mind that it hasn't passed through Congress. And if it does manage to become a law, its focus will be roads and bridges and perhaps some 5G-network spending thrown in for good measure. The positive impact on cruise lines will be mostly indirect and probably delayed.

Ms Vardy, 38, has filed a defamation case against the wife of Wayne Rooney after Ms Rooney posted an accusation on Instagram last October about leaks to a tabloid newspaper.
 Coleen said she posted a string of fake updates about her life onto her private social media in order to expose someone who had been leaking stories about her.
 The scandal earned Coleen the nickname of ‘Wagatha Christie’ after she made a post on Instagram in which she detailed the steps she took to expose the source of the stories.
 According to reports the two women held a video meditation session last month but it fell flat and now the case is to come to court with legal bills expected to reach up to £500,000 on each side.
 The proceedings are expected to begin in the new year.

In 2010, almost 78 percent of voters opposed a constitutional amendment removing 'Providence Plantations' from the state's name.

RICKY STENHOUSE JR.: Yeah, it was cool to see everybody pushing bush's car there down to the front. I would say it was a Kevin and Jimmie idea that everybody jumped onboard with. Then to see all the crew members follow suit was really cool.

The partnership between Apple and Intel was formed in 2005, when Steve Jobs outlined a move away from PowerPC processors onstage at the same Apple event series for developers. Intel helped Apple catch up to Windows computers, some of which were more powerful at the time. In tandem, though, Apple was working on more energy-efficient chips for mobile devices based on Arm Ltd. designs and continues to use those to power the iPhone and iPad.

After all, this is not a president who ascribes to the shirt sleeves photo op. Not someone who invites his electorate in to see him, jacket tossed aside, elbows-deep in work at his desk. Not someone interested, like President Barack Obama and former Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain or even former Vice President Joe Biden, who seems equally comfortable with or without a tie, in announcing his sensitivity to the younger generation and their value system by willingly rejecting the suit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    He is, rather someone who believes deeply in the pageantry of his office, of airbrushed calculation (see: Ivanka, Melania, even Jared), branding, and the power of costume. Be that pageantry in the generals whom he famously once lauded as “straight from central casting” or his disastrously staged march across Lafayette Park to St. John’s Church in response to the protests in Washington D.C.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It’s a tenet that was clearly on display in Tulsa not just in his own uniform — the flag-reflecting blue suit, white shirt, red tie — but in supporting acts that included Lara Trump, son Eric’s wife and a Trump campaign adviser, in a white wrap dress; Kimberly Guilfoyle, son Don Jr.’s girlfriend and chairwoman of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, in a bright blue wrap dress; and Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, in red, like a matching patriotic array.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And when it comes to Mr. Trump’s costume, the tie matters. Especially the bright red tie, which he made his doppelgänger during the 2016 campaign, glowing in all its Republican glory; subliminally reminding everyone of the party’s Reagan heyday; of the good old times when everyone dressed according to establishment role; representing, in all its ridiculous, below-the-belt length — well, who knows? Something! Manhood or power or Mr. Trump’s willingness to stretch the rules (he also Scotch-taped the back, remember?). The psychological speculation has been endless, and varied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The problem is, when the tie becomes a sign of victory, it can also be a sign of defeat. So it looked Sunday morning. Sure, it was very early. You can understand why a tie might be undone. But Mr. Trump understands as well as anyone that he is always on display, always playing his part. There isn’t really a backstage in his job, especially during his entrance and exit moments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Add to that the cap-in-hand, and the symbolism gets pretty loaded. As one observer tweeted, “I mean, when does a baseball coach scrunch up their team cap — it ain’t when they’re winning, is it?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Nope. It’s usually when they are about to throw it on the ground and jump up and down on it in frustration and disgust, because nothing is going according to plan.

Which is why, through all the bombast and brouhaha, the denialism and accusations, that both characterized the flop in Oklahoma and followed it, the unplanned photo op stood out as a rare moment of truth, caught on camera.

The third lane I felt like with this package got hurt the most. It seemed like you could get some runs going, but it would stall out pretty quick. Seemed like the bottom and middle were the way to go. It kind of took the top lane out of it, which in turn a lot of times we run single file around the top and the race can get kind of stale.

JIMMIE JOHNSON: For me, I feel like I went through all of those emotions. When I woke up this morning, read the news, anger, pissed off, all of that. My blood was boiling. I could not believe that that had happened.

"Yeah, I felt like I was a sitting duck there by myself," Stenhouse said on MRN Radio. "Just trying to pick up different people to draft with all day. The Fords really stuck together, [Kyle Busch] and I pushed really good [at] each other and then, I don't know what issue he had. So, I lost that guy, which I worked well with all day. All in all, our NOS Energy Drink car was really fast. Glad that a few fans got to stay here and watch a great race. I felt like we battled hard all day and put on a great show. It was fun."

With half of US states reporting a rise in new cases, one expert warns of 'danger signs' in some parts of the US.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    After weeks of many Americans failing to heed face mask and social distancing guidelines, health officials in some states are reporting an increase in younger populations testing positive -- saying those individuals are often asymptomatic but could be infecting others. And public health measures meant to control infection aren't quite up to speed -- a problem the country has consistently faced in past months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "As you reopen ... you expect to see more cases. But what we're hearing, in terms of the public health model -- of testing people, through contact tracing, and then isolation and quarantine -- it doesn't sound like it's working as well as it really needs to," says former acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Richard Besser.

Digg won the battle for users in those early years, thanks to a button that could be embedded on other websites. But it took itself out of the running permanently with a disastrous redesign in 2010, meant to appeal to advertisers. Digg users rebelled and started posting links to Reddit, which remained staunchly primitive until a (relatively minor) 2018 redesign.

Across the UK, as of 9am 22 June, there have been 8,029,757 tests, with 139,659 tests on 21 June. 305,289 people have tested positive.
 As of 5pm on 21 June, of those tested positive for coronavirus, across all settings, 42,647 have died.
 These latest figures come as the number of global coronavirus cases continues to surge in many large countries which have been lifting lockdowns, including the US, even as new infections stabilise or drop in parts of western Europe.
 India has been recording about 15,000 new infections each day, and some states are considering fresh lockdown measures to try to halt the spread of the virus in the nation of more than 1.3 billion.
 The government earlier lifted a nationwide lockdown in a bid to restart the ailing Indian economy, which has shed millions of jobs.
 Hospitals in Pakistan are turning away patients, but with the economy there teetering, the government remains determined to reopen the country.
 New cases have also shown a steep rise in Mexico, Colombia and Indonesia.
 Brazil, with more than 1.1 million cases and 51,000 deaths, has been affected more than anywhere except the US, which has reported more than 2.3 million cases and 120,000 deaths, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.
 In the US, surges in cases across the south and west of the country are raising fears that progress against the virus is slipping away, as states reopen and many Americans resist wearing masks and keeping their distance from others.
 On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci will return to Capitol Hill at a fraught moment in America’s response. The US government’s top infectious disease expert will testify before a US house of representatives committee.
 His testimony comes after US president Donald Trump said at a weekend rally in Oklahoma that he had asked administration officials to slow down testing, because too many positive cases are turning up.
 Many rally-goers did not wear masks – an act of defiance for some against what they see as government intrusion.
 White House officials later tried to walk back Mr Trump’s comment on testing, suggesting it was not meant to be taken literally.
