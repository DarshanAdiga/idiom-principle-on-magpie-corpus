WATERMAEL-BOITSFORT, Belgium (AP) — Something he saw as he drove to work one morning gave Tristan Van den Bosch an uplifting idea.
 “I saw a man shouting at his mother,” said Van den Bosch.
 Not unusual — except that the man was on the ground and his mother was three stories up. She was, like many seniors, locked down in a care home to avoid the COVID-19 virus. But as days have turned to weeks and months, families like this one have struggled.
 “We can help this man!” Van den Bosch thought.
 As operations manager at Group-f, a cleaning and maintenance company, Van der Bosch had a problem. The pandemic had reduced business to a trickle, leaving many of his cranes standing idle in the depot.
 Why not use those cranes to lift people, so they can see relatives on the upper floors of homes for the aged?
 Since then, Van den Bosch has been driving his cranes to homes in several towns across Belgium. A platform carries families to their relatives’ windows. A daughter or grandson waves, and worries vanish from faces creased by age. No internet connection does as well.

Ishaan Khatter also revealed why he opted to work in _A Suitable Boy_. He said that he had been gone through several narrations and readings, but this one stuck with him. The actor added that when somebody like Mira Nair, gives herself to you in such a wonderful way, she was very generous and welcoming. She showed more enthusiasm about having him on board then he did and he found himself taken by her nature.

Oh the glamour! After giving birth women can be faced with a whole new host of health issues which can continue when they return to work. Some women may face several issues with breastfeeding in the postpartum period. In some cases when the breasts are full, they can leak and squirt milk so they will need to be pumped manually. Not to mention the feeling they may explode at any moment which is enough to put any of us on edge!

Natalie was going to have an uphill battle convincing a jury of winners to reward her $2 million dollars after spending exactly seven days in the game. The rest of the time she was on Edge.

Nevertheless, she was absolutely dominant while on Edge, securing way more fire tokens than anyone else, winning the majority of challenges out there and forging real bonds and relationships with everyone there... who also happen to be the same people voting.

In other words, no one can deny how hard she worked on the Edge, which makes her returning to the game on Day 35 somehow less controversial than when Chris went out on Day 8 only to return Day 35 and win the game. This Edge had a lot more going on and we saw that Natalie was playing every bit as hard as those in the game, just in a very different way.

I'm the first to admit that throughout pregnancy there are many changes that our bodies experience and this also applies after you have given birth. This can take some getting used to when you return to work. In this post I'll take a look at some of the common concerns mums have when returning to the workplace after maternity and I'll suggest how to maintain a healthy lifestyle whilst acknowledging that that is easier said than done when you're tired and constantly juggling.
