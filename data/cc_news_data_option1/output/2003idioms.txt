WASHINGTON — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits in the two months since the coronavirus took hold in the U.S. has swelled to nearly 39 million, the government reported Thursday, even as states from coast to coast gradually reopen their economies and let people go back to work.


  More than 2.4 million people filed for unemployment last week in the latest wave of layoffs from the business shutdowns that have brought the economy to its knees, the Labor Department said.


  That brings the running total to a staggering 38.6 million, a job-market collapse unprecedented in its speed.


  The number of weekly applications has slowed for seven straight weeks. Yet the figures remain breathtakingly high — 10 times higher than normal before the crisis struck.


  It shows that even though all states have begun reopening over the past three weeks, employment has yet to snap back and the outbreak is still damaging businesses and destroying jobs.


  “While the steady decline in claims is good news, the labor market is still in terrible shape,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial.


  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said over the weekend that U.S. unemployment could peak in May or June at 20% to 25%, a level last seen during the depths of the Great Depression almost 90 years ago. Unemployment in April stood at 14.7%, a figure also unmatched since the 1930s.


  Over 5 million people worldwide have been confirmed infected by the virus, and more than 330,000 deaths have been recorded, including over 94,000 in the U.S. and around 165,000 in Europe, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University and based on government data. Experts believe the true toll is significantly higher.


  In other developments:


  — President Donald Trump’s approval ratings have remained steady amid the crisis, underscoring the way Americans seem to have made up their minds about him. A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research says 41% approve of his job performance, while 58% disapprove. That’s consistent with opinions of him throughout his three years in office.


  — Trump made a trip to Michigan to tour a Ford factory that has been retooled to manufacture ventilators, and he did not wear a face covering despite a warning from the state’s top law enforcement officer that a refusal might lead to a ban on his return. The president has been locked in a feud with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer over the outbreak and also has threatened to withhold federal funds over Michigan's expansion of voting by mail.


  — Whitmer has prevailed after Republican lawmakers sued over her authority to declare emergencies and order sweeping restrictions during the pandemic. The Republican-controlled Legislature didn't extend her declaration in late April but she acted anyway. That means her stay-at-home decree stands, which has drawn anger from gun-toting protesters and is likely to be extended beyond May 28.


  Across the U.S., some companies have begun to rehire their laid-off employees as states have eased restrictions on movement and commerce. On Monday, more than 130,000 workers at the three major American automakers, plus Toyota and Honda, returned to their factories for the first time in two months.


  Still, major employers keep cutting jobs. Uber said this week that it will lay off 3,000 more employees because demand for rides has plummeted. Digital publishers Vice, Quartz and BuzzFeed, magazine giant Conde Nast and the owner of The Economist magazine announced job cuts last week.


  Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the latest layoffs may be particularly worrisome because they are happening even as states reopen.


  “There’s a high probability that those layoffs could persist for longer than those that were a function of (businesses) just being closed,” Stanley said.


  The latest figures do not mean 38.6 million people are out of work. Some have been called back, and others have landed new jobs. But the vast majority are still unemployed.


  An additional 1.2 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week under a federal program that makes self-employed, contractor and gig workers eligible for the first time. But those figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations, so the government doesn’t include them in the overall number of applications.


  Alexis Weber, laid off from her job as a bartender at an Atlanta restaurant, said it was a struggle to secure unemployment benefits — she filed on April 1 and had to wait until early May to get her first payment. She is not sure when her employer will want her back, or if she will want to return.


  “Social distancing doesn’t really apply very well to the hospitality business,” Weber said. “I don’t feel safe returning right now.”


  One rehired worker, Norman Boughman, received an email last week from his boss at a secondhand clothing store in Richmond, Virginia, where he worked part time, asking him to return. But even with a mask, he worries about his health.


  “We’re having to sort through people’s things, and I feel like that puts us at a higher risk,” he said.


  European countries also have seen heavy job losses, but robust government safety-net programs in places like Germany and France are subsidizing the wages of millions of workers and keeping them on the payroll.


  Meanwhile, doubts are growing over ambitious plans by European governments to use contact-tracing smartphone apps to fight the spread of the virus as they ease their lockdowns. The apps can help authorities determine whether people have crossed paths with those who are infected.


  British Security Minister James Brokenshire told the BBC that an app that was supposed to be introduced by mid-May is not ready, suggesting “technical issues” were to blame. Similarly, France delayed last week's roll-out of its app because of technical problems and privacy concerns.


  As for the search for a vaccine, drugmaker AstraZeneca said it has secured agreements to produce 400 million doses of a still experimental and unproven formulation that is being tested at the University of Oxford. It is one of the most advanced projects in the international race for a vaccine.


  AstraZeneca said it has received more than $1 billion from a U.S. government research agency for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine.


  Around the world, the effort to get back to business is raising worries over the risk of new infections, from hard-hit Milan, Italy, to meatpacking plants in Colorado and garment factories in Bangladesh.


  China's top economic official promised higher spending to revive the economy and curb job losses as the fight persists against the virus, which emerged in Wuhan late last year. The budget deficit will swell by 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) this year to help meet targets that include creating 9 million jobs, Premier Li Keqiang said at the country's ceremonial legislature.

“Me going on my bus from town to town is not congruent with what we should be doing in America,” he said.                                                                 He has applied for government aid but is preparing for a brutal year ahead.                                                                 “Small businesses along the trail, one of America’s national treasures, they’re being ignored,” he said. “I’m willing to bet we’ll see 50% of hostels along the trail will close.”                                                                 The Open Arms Hostel in Luray, Virginia, normally has hundreds of visitors in the spring. This year, its owner, Alison Coltrane, had one guest between April 6 and May 14 as she abided by a county ban on short-term lodging. Coltrane, 55, was able to get a three-month deferment on her mortgage, and to stay afloat, she started delivering pizza for Domino’s at night and working 5 a.m. shifts at a Walmart distribution center.                                                                 “I am a one-woman show,” she said. “It’s been rough. I miss my hikers.”                                                                 Colin Gooder, the owner of Gooder Grove Hostel in Franklin, North Carolina, was an early bearer of warnings to hikers, even before he shut down in mid-March. While most hikers followed official guidance, he said, some were offended that he asked them to take precautions and wear masks.                                                                 “There was almost a subculture of indignation about it,” he said. “The division that has hit all of society is now affecting the Appalachian Trail’s society and culture.”                                                                 And he said that although his business has been devastated — his application for government aid is in limbo, and he is only now cautiously reopening under state guidelines — he did not regret raising an early alarm.                                                                 “It’s hard to tell people that something they had planned for years, for the next six months of their lives, is impossible right now,” he said. “Don’t shoot the messenger.”                                                                 Some hostels have tried to continue serving thru-hikers. David Magee, the owner of the Station at 19E in Roan Mountain, Tennessee, said he has had hikers stranded from Europe and Hawaii.                                                                 “What do I do? Close and go home while I’ve got these grubby hikers here?” he said. “I can’t turn my back on hikers.”                                                                 “It’s a hard choice, it’s like there is no good answer,” he said.                                                                 Many hikers, on and off the trail, suggested there was no right answer for everyone. Even those who disagreed with the conservancy’s decision said they respected the organization and understood its leaders’ rationale.                                                                 “They had to cover themselves and do something,” said a thru-hiker who asked to go by her trail name, Caboose, to avoid the backlash some hikers have experienced. “The question everyone is asking themselves is what could the ATC have done to make sure that we could still have the hikers and still have the distancing. I don’t know.”                                                                 Ultimately, she said, she and her sister decided to start hiking this month.                                                                 “We’re doing it for us,” she said.

Salons


  When making your appointment, ask about safety measures. You might be required to attend your appointment alone, wash your hair at home to reduce traffic near the shampoo area, and wait in your car or outside until your appointment begins. In addition, you might ask whether the salon is offering blow drying. Eliminating blow drying could reduce the spread of germs.


  Ideally, the salon will stagger appointments to limit how many people are in the facility at the same time. You might ask about the salon’s disinfecting practices. Is the staff regularly wiping down high-touch surfaces? Are chairs and headrests disinfected after they are used? Is the staff wearing cloth face coverings and regularly washing their hands? Are they wearing single-use gloves for nail and facial work? Also, look for touchless payment options.


  Grocery stores


  Before going to get your groceries, consider visiting the chain’s website to check on the precautions being taken. For smaller businesses, call the store.


  To make social distancing easy, visit the grocery store early in the morning or late at night, when the store might be less crowded. If you’re at higher risk of serious illness, find out if the store has special hours for people in your situation and shop during these times. You might also consider ordering your groceries online for home delivery or curbside pickup.


  At the store, disinfect the handle of the shopping cart or basket. Stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others while shopping and in lines. If possible, pay without touching money or a keypad or use hand sanitizer after paying. Also, apply hand sanitizer after you leave the store. When you get home, wash your hands.


  Banks


  During visits to the bank, use the ATM, if possible. Clean the ATM keyboard with a disinfecting wipe before using it. When you are done, apply hand sanitizer. Wash your hands when you get home.


  Gas stations


  Before pumping gas wipe down any handles or buttons you’ll need to touch. After you finish fueling, apply hand sanitizer. Wash your hands when you get home or the next time you are near a sink.


  Pharmacy


  Plan to order and pick up all of your prescriptions at the same time. If possible, call in prescription orders ahead of time and use a drive-thru window, curbside pickup, mail order or other delivery service. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you can get a larger supply of medication so that you don’t have to visit the pharmacy as often.


  Massage therapy


  Before having a massage, ask about what precautions your massage therapist is taking to prevent COVID-19. Ideally, the number of people in the space will be limited to allow for social distancing and you’ll be able to check in and out using virtual tools.


  Massage rooms, communal areas and any objects you might touch should be thoroughly cleaned, disinfected and sanitized. Ask about the laundry policy for linens, towels and other washable items. Massage therapists should follow hand-washing and hygiene protocols and use equipment to protect themselves, such as gloves and masks.


  Parks and outdoor spaces


  Before heading out, check with state and local authorities to see if parks, recreational facilities, natural bodies of water, beaches and swim areas are open. The National Park Service will decide on a park-by-park basis if a national park will open. If an area is going to be open, check if bathrooms and food concession stands also are open.


  Choose a park that is close to home. Travel often involves stops, which can expose you to COVID-19. Keep space between yourself and others when using swimming pools.


  While at the park, look for open areas, trails and paths that allow you to keep a distance of 6 feet (2 meters) from others. Avoid crowded areas.


  As businesses continue to open, guidelines might change. Stay informed. Also, don’t be afraid to ask questions. If you don’t feel confident about a business’s safety practices, postpone your visit. Protecting your health is worth it.

Charlotte, Atlanta and Texas Motor Speedway, facilities all owned by Speedway Motorsports, have condo towers with floor-to-ceiling windows with a clear view of the track. Some are decorated as lavish homes with king-size beds, leather couches and custom-made bars, while others resemble rentable hospitality rooms for entertaining guests.


  They aren’t cheap.


  A luxury two-bedroom, 1,400-square-foot condo at Charlotte’s Turn One Towers typically runs between $500,000 and $600,000. At Texas Motor Speedway, a one- bedroom, 1,000-square-foot unit is on the market for $199,000, with larger units available for $345,000 to $485,000. The IndyCar series opens its season at TMS on June 6 and the condos in Turn 2 are expected to be the only option for fans to watch live.


  Most of the Charlotte condo owners have some connection to NASCAR, but few live at the track year round. They’re mostly used to entertain clients during races, although Trent Cawthon of TriMaxx Graphics in nearby Mooresville uses his condo for both. TriMaxx produces vinyl graphic paint schemes for several Cup teams including Ryan Newman and Ricky Stenhouse Jr.


  Residents typically received five complimentary tickets from the speedway with an option to purchase up to 15 or 20 more depending on the size of the condominium. Residents are allowed just the five tickets this year and security is expected at the entrance to the building to prevent additional guests. Once inside, everyone must stay in the condo before and during the race.


  Cawthon understands the restrictions.


  He said his phone has been “ringing off the hook” this week with requests from friends who are craving live racing. Instead of hosting a typical watch party, he’s planning to hunker down with three buddies and some pizza and beverages to watch the race. .


  “I love it that way,” Cawthon said. “You don’t have to worry about the hospitality and making sure everyone has enough food and drinks, and then making sure some of these people don’t have too many drinks before they head home. So it’s a lot less hassle.”

DULUTH, Minn. — Essentia Health said Thursday it is laying off 900 employees as the coronavirus pandemic cuts into business.


  Essentia Health CEO David Herman said in a statement that the recent cost- reduction measures the Duluth-based health care system has taken “are not sufficient to preserve our mission and the health of the organization.”


  The cuts represent 6% of Essentia’s workforce, the Star Tribune reported. The cuts are in addition to 850 Essentia employees who have been placed on administrative leave.


  Essentia is the largest employer in Duluth with more than 6,000 employees in the northeastern Minnesota city. The health system has about 14,500 employees in Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin.


  More than 450 jobs will be lost in the Twin Ports of Duluth and Superior, Wisconsin, with the rest of the layoffs spread across Fargo, North Dakota; Detroit Lakes, Brainerd and other regional locations.


  About 20% of the layoffs affect staff in direct patient care. The rest is spread across support services.


  Minnesota hospitals are dealing with a steep drop in business while preparing for an expected surge of COVID-19 patients. Routine visits have been postponed and elective surgeries were not allowed until recently.


  “While surgeries and procedures are restarting at our facilities, we are approaching that process carefully and slowly to protect our communities, patients and staff, preserve personal protective equipment and ensure available hospital beds for COVID-19 patients,” Essentia said in a news release.


  The Minnesota Nurses Association said none of its members are affected by the layoffs.

I hadn't really heard much Alan Vega/Suicide until fairly recently. I was aware of him, for sure, and every time I'd hear something of his, my ears would prick up. But, he was someone I'd always forget to follow up on. Working in a record store, though, you have that fortunate thing where you're staring at records all day, so you can be reminded of things you've been meaning to check out. Luckily a couple of years ago I spotted a copy of 'Saturn Strip' on top of a pile of LPs at the shop. The cover practically jumped out at me, all fluorescent pink and neon glows, and Vega decked out in leather jacket, bandana and a tiger t-shirt. Right up my alley, as someone that lived through the 80s as a kid. First listen hit me like a bolt of lightning, and I knew right away that I had to buy it. A punk rock cowboy with synthesizer, drum machine, and minimal guitar. Simple, repetitive, and unbelievably catchy songs that get your shoulders wiggling and your feet tapping. Completely addictive stuff. And that 'Wipeout Beat'! God damn, I don't know how many times I've cranked that song since buying the record. Chunky synth sounds and melodies to die for with that classic 80s beat, and a cool rhythmic spoken croon. Alan Vega combines my love of 80s pop music with my love of punk rock, country, and Elvis. I'm sure this record put some ideas in my head for my new album. No doubt about it.

My Script' really struck a chord with me. It was simultaneously written and recorded, and is basically Kim doing most things on the record (with producer/engineer Myles Mumford), with a few guests throughout. It's a damn fine album. The songs are fantastic. The lyrics are clever, and sometimes quite funny. He really has a way with words. And the guitar playing is out of this world. The album has now been out for 5 years, and I'm still listening to it on high rotation. And, as fate would have it, I've recently joined Kim's live band, and I've been playing a lot of these songs on stage with him, and I'm still not sick of them. It's actually made me love the songs even more (if that was even possible).

As a teenager growing up in Geelong in the '90s, I'm lucky to have been around for the early years of Magic Dirt, and all of those all-ages shows. I was a huge fan from the very first moment I saw the band on stage, and Adalita immediately became my favourite woman in music. Someone I could really look up to. Her voice was incredible, and she had all the rock moves and kick arse guitar to go with it. I couldn't take my eyes off her. Over the years, I've seen MD countless times, and still have their very first 7″ single in my collection, along all of their other releases. I've also been blessed to get to know the band, and play a few gigs with them myself. They're lovely people, and have all been so supportive of my music for a long time now.

Alaska has reported just over 400 cases of COVID-19, with 10 deaths. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death.


  Travis Smith, who co-owns two restaurants in Juneau, said he left town in December for a brief sabbatical after coming off what he called his “best year ever" in business. From afar, he said he watched as things fell apart “in a matter of weeks.”


  The state in March ordered restaurants closed for dine-in services; drive-up, delivery and drive-through options remained. Though the state in late April began letting restaurants resume dine-in service with limits on capacity, Smith said, from a business standpoint it didn't make sense.


  Smith's restaurant, The Rookery Cafe, has a long, narrow flow and “you do have to do so much business to make these things make sense,” he said. It recently opened for takeout service.


  As of Friday, businesses in Alaska were allowed to fully reopen. State guidance says businesses should help individuals with “personal mitigation strategies,” such as encouraging face coverings, regular cleaning and finding ways for customers to keep distance from each other.


  Collette Costa, co-owner and manager of the Gold Town Nickelodeon, said she has projects she wants to work on at her Juneau theater but also would be cautious about reopening. The theater has been doing drive-in screenings.


  She said she doesn't know what the future will hold for her industry.


  “I just know that I don’t want to get sick. I don't want to get anyone sick,” she said.

The film is a mystery and a thriller, wrapped up in a bit of melodrama, to boot. Lauren Monroe (Lily Collins) is an ambitious young District Attorney in New York. The daughter of the wealthy and powerful Archer Monroe (Patrick Warburton), Lauren has always taken a more altruistic path than the rest of the family, including her Congressman brother William Monroe (Chace Crawford). When the patriarch of the Monroe family passes away unexpectedly, he leaves most of his inheritance to his wife Catherine Monroe (Connie Nielsen) and William. Lauren receives some money, but also a secret of Archer's that he only trusts her with. Thus begins a descent into something quite bizarre, involving a man named Morgan Warner (Pegg). What happens once they meet, and the circumstances in which they meet, are best left to be discovered, but it's just the tip of the iceberg, in terms of shocking secrets. Vaughn Stein directs a screenplay by Matthew Kennedy, with cinematography by Michael Merriman, while Marlon Espino composed the score. Supporting players include Michael Beach, Alec James, Josh Murray, Marque Richardson, and more.

And for a little while it seemed as if we were finally settling on a strategy for containing the virus while also limiting the economic hardship caused by the lockdown.                                                                 But Trump and the Republican Party as a whole have now given up on that strategy. They won’t say this explicitly, and they’re throwing up various disingenuous explanations for what they’re doing, but their basic position is that thousands of Americans must die for the Dow.

MADISON — Business owners, candidates for office, a pastor and one of the organizers of last month's “reopen Wisconsin” protest at the Wisconsin Capitol have filed a federal lawsuit alleging that local stay-at-home orders are unconstitutional.


  The lawsuit, filed by 17 Wisconsin residents Wednesday in federal court in Milwaukee, challenges the local orders that took effect after the state Supreme Court last week tossed out Gov. Tony Evers' statewide “safer at home” order as unconstitutional. The new lawsuit names 21 state and local Wisconsin public safety and health officials, including Evers and all members of the state elections commission, as defendants.


  The lawsuit asks the judge to declare the local orders unconstitutional and void them all.


  The lawsuit claims violations of the constitutional rights of assembly, free speech, exercise of religion and equal protection. It also argued that two candidates for office, one for state Assembly and another for Congress, were impaired in their ability to circulate petitions to collect nomination signatures to get on the ballot because of local stay-at-home orders.


  Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said last week that the local orders, many of which have already been rescinded, were legal. Ryan Nilsestuen, Evers’ attorney, said Thursday that he was confident the new lawsuit will “go nowhere," noting the Kaul opinion.


  Dane County Executive Joe Parisi, whose county includes the capital city of Madison and has a stay-at-home order in place, promised to fight the lawsuit.


  “This pandemic is the greatest threat to the public health and safety of families this generation will experience,” he said in a statement. "We will vigorously defend common sense provisions based on public health guidance to protect the well-being of the residents of Dane County. We do not want to become the next large community consumed by the ravages of this highly contagious, debilitating virus.”


  Madison Marie Elmer, who organized a Capitol rally that attracted about 1,500 p eople last month, is among those bringing the lawsuit. Others include the Rev. Daniel Jay Quakkelaar, pastor of the Friend of Sinners Mission Church in Milwaukee; Cindy Werner, a Republican congressional candidate in Milwaukee; Jay Schroeder, a candidate for state Assembly in Neenah; and Blong Yang, owner of the Eggrolls Inc., restaurant in Appleton.


  They are represented by Joseph Voiland of Veterans Liberty Law. Voiland served as an Ozaukee County Circuit Court judge from 2013-2019.

The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to avoid exposure. If you go out, wear a cloth face covering. Keep a distance of about 6 feet (2 meters) from others if COVID-19 is spreading in your community, especially if you have a higher risk of serious illness. Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick or has symptoms. Also, avoid large events and mass gatherings.


  In addition, practice good hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze and then wash your hands or use hand sanitizer. Also, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.


  If you feel sick, stay home. Don’t visit public areas unless you’re going to get medical care. Avoid taking public transportation if you’re sick.


  And if you’re at higher risk of serious illness, don’t head out into the community just yet. It’s safer to stay home. If other members of your household return to work or visit places where social distancing isn’t possible, it’s recommended that they isolate themselves from you.


  Safety tips for public places


  Beyond taking general precautions to prevent COVID-19, consider specific safety tips for visiting different public places.


  Traveling


  Before traveling check the websites of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) for health advisories and self-quarantine requirements. Consider checking the Transportation Security Administration’s website and your airline’s website for additional guidance.


  Consider the risks associated with different types of travel. There might be a risk of getting COVID-19 on a crowded flight if other travelers on board are infected. On a bus or train, sitting or standing within 6 feet (2 meters) of others for a prolonged period can put you at risk of getting or spreading COVID-19. Traveling by car or recreational vehicle often involves stops that could put you in close contact with infected people.


  If you’re planning on booking a hotel room, check the hotel’s website to learn about precautions being taken and if amenities, such as the gym or restaurant, will be open. Bring cleaning supplies with you. When you get to your room, disinfect all high-touch surfaces, such as light switches, sink faucet handles, door knobs and the remote control. Wash plates, cups or silverware before using. Also, confirm the hotel’s cancellation policy before making a booking.


  Restaurants


  Before you go to a restaurant, check the restaurant’s safety practices. Are the employees wearing cloth face coverings, regularly disinfecting high-touch surfaces and practicing social distancing? Is there good ventilation? Are tables set far enough apart from each other to allow for social distancing?


  Ideally, the restaurant won’t offer salad bars, buffets and drink-filling stations that require people to use common utensils or dispensers. If you need to wait in line for service, maintain a distance of at least 6 feet (2 meters) from others.


  When ordering takeout, try to pay online or over the phone to limit contact with others. If you’re having food delivered, ask for it to be left outside your home in a safe spot, such as the porch or your building’s lobby. Otherwise, stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from the delivery person. If you’re picking up your food at the restaurant, maintain social distancing while waiting in the pickup zone. After bringing home your food, wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.


  Gyms


  Before going to the gym, call to see if it’s limiting how many members are allowed in at the same time. You might have to reserve a block of time in advance, with staff cleaning the facility between blocks. Ask about the facility’s cleaning and disinfecting policies and whether you’ll be able to use the locker room or bathroom. If you are interested in group exercise classes, ask if they are being offered.


  Your gym will likely enforce social distancing by blocking access to every other cardio machine. Follow the gym’s guidelines and stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other members. Clean equipment before and after using it. Some equipment that’s difficult to clean, such as foam rollers and yoga blocks, might not be available.


  If you’re at higher risk of serious illness, you might consider waiting to return to the gym. Ask if your gym offers virtual classes or training.

“Recent events have directed us to investigate additional technologies for improving cabin air for our heating and air conditioning systems. We’re also looking at antimicrobial materials and easily-cleanable surfaces for our interiors,” a Fiat Chrysler spokesperson said.                                                                 “COVID-19 will prompt more focus on air filtration and, perhaps, on more segregated climate zones in the cockpit, features there was already movement toward. But more extreme measures, like antibacterial touch surfaces, will be poorly rewarded in the long term if they mean less visually attractive or durable interiors” said Eric Noble of product development consultant The Carlab.

You do a full cleaning between shifts or at the end of the day and maintain it with short doses throughout the day.”                                                                             Advertisement

TIVERTON -- No dice was the answer Tiverton officials got from the state lottery and governor's office to a request to make good on $1.84 million in gaming revenue the town believes it is owed for this fiscal year.


   


  "They disagree with our position. They definitely told us we're not getting paid," said Interim Town Administrator Christopher Cotta.


   


  The town is now considering legal action.


   


  The Town Council had a special meeting Thursday night to discuss the casino revenue and budget going forward, and then went into executive session.


   


  Town Clerk Nancy Mello said the executive session lasted 20 minutes and ended with a vote. "I'm unable to disclose it at this time because it could jeopardize our legal strategy regarding the casino guaranteed payment," Mello said Friday.


   


  Cotta and Town Solicitor Michael Marcello had a virtual meeting with state officials last week that was arranged by Rep. John 'Jay' Edwards, D-Tiverton, who also sat in on the meeting.


   


  The town was guaranteed $3.1 million in gaming revenue from the state once the casino was open a full fiscal year. Casino revenue to the town for fiscal 2020, beginning July 1, 2019 and ending June 30, 2020, totaled some $1.25 million before the Twin River Tiverton Casino Hotel was shuttered in mid-March to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19.


   


  "Their opinion is that the guarantee is no longer valid," Cotta said, because the facility was not open the entire fiscal year and the casino has to be offering gaming for the town to get its share.


   


  "I'm not surprised," Town Council President Patricia Hilton said, "but I'm very disappointed."


   


  Edwards said he plans to push for a prorated payment to the town.


   


  "Their opinion is once the casino closes their obligation stops," Edwards said of the state. "That might be true," said Edwards, but the casino was open for three quarters of the fiscal year and the town should then get a prorated amount of revenue based on those three quarters.


   


  Instead of $3.1 million, the town should realize a total of $2.3 million.


   


  "If you took $3.1 million and divided it into quarters and paid the town based on that, the state would meet its obligation," Edwards said. "Rep. Dennis Canario and I are trying to work with the House leadership to see if we can get it prorated," said Edwards who is a member of the House finance committee.


   


  Anything the representatives can do is much appreciated, Cotta said, but he thinks it will be tough to get legislators from other parts of the state to agree because all municipalities in the state are facing huge financial issues due to the economic shutdown from the coronavirus pandemic.


   


  "All the big cities are looking for their share too. It's a big ask," Cotta said.


   


  The state is facing a $900 million revenue shortfall between the current fiscal year and next fiscal year that begins July 1, said Edwards.


   


  "It's a huge hole," Edwards said.


   


  Revenue from gaming and the lottery is the state's third-largest revenue source "and we're going to take a major hit," Edwards said, even in the next fiscal year because once the casinos reopen there will be social distancing guidelines that would limit the number of people in the facilities in Tiverton and Twin River Casino in Lincoln.


   


  Cotta is working to find savings in this year's budget and looking to next year's budget that has not yet been formulated but will be affected by revenue shortfalls right out of the gate.


   


  Department heads have been asked to let union workers know that the town is in a "financial crunch," Cotta said, and may have to consider layoffs and furloughs. "It's a door-opener to start the discussions," Cotta said of workers being made aware of the situation and possible steps needed to address it.


   


  "It's going to be a lot of belt-tightening everywhere," Hilton said.


   


  The council plans to ask the School Committee to meet soon to discuss the budget.

NEW YORK (AP) — Authorities investigating the long-running mystery of skeletal remains strewn along a suburban New York beach highway said Friday they have identified the remains of one of the women using DNA technology.


  Suffolk County police said they would soon post information about the woman, known as “Jane Doe No. 6," to a website the department created about the case. Police officials declined to provide more specific information about when the announcement would be made.


  The previously unidentified woman's remains were found in two areas of Long Island, more than 40 miles (65 kilometers) and a decade apart: in 2000 in Manorville, near where Long Island splits into its two eastern forks, and in 2011 near Gilgo Beach on the Atlantic Coast, where the remains of 11 people were found.


  Investigators have been unable to determine who killed them or whether a lone serial killer or several suspects were involved. Over the years, they've said it is unlikely one person killed all the victims.


  The case has attracted national headlines, been featured on true-crime television shows and was the subject of a recent Netflix film.


  The previously unidentified woman is at least the second whose remains were found at the beach and also in Manorville. Police found the skull of Jessica Taylor, a 20-year-old prostitute who disappeared in 2003, near Gilgo Beach and most of the rest of her body in a wooded area of Manorville.


  In January, police revealed a previously unreleased photograph of initials on a black leather belt — either an HM or WH, depending on the angle — that they say was handled by an unknown suspect.


  Last fall, state officials gave investigators the green light to ask the FBI to deploy genetic genealogy, a technique in which genetic profiles are run though databases to find potential relatives of a homicide victim or suspect. It's that technology that led to the woman's identification, police said.

Or maybe it’s just recycling that most tired of Middle East conflict cliches — the well-worn cycle of violence, where killings beget killings and no one enjoys the moral upper hand. You’ll enjoy the show more if you aren’t wedded to any of these narratives.


  You’ll also need to suspend your disbelief. Wait, this seemingly hyper- realistic portrayal of Israeli counter-terrorism ops isn’t actually how it is? You mean, Palestinians haven’t gotten hip to the fact that the same four guys and (and one hijab-wearing woman) keep showing up on West Bank street corners just when the bombs start exploding? You mean, Israeli commandos aren’t routinely seducing Palestinian doctors to get close to their patients? You mean, Bashar and his dad managed to smuggle two kidnapped Israelis across the breadth of the country while a full-scale manhunt is underway (or that they even thought it was a good idea to try)? The list goes on — but you should suspend this line of thinking too.


  I found these plot absurdities galling at times, but let it go. At the end of the day, “Fauda” is just good television. Not perfect, mind you. There’s the “Game of Thrones”-esque tendency to kill off characters we’ve grown fond of, though perhaps that’s one concession to realism the writers couldn’t avoid making.


  And then there’s the sense, familiar to fans of “Narcos,” that every scene has happened a dozen times already — the team taking up poses of practiced nonchalance in a some dusty village; the drones above streaming buckets of data to a command center; IDF officers pensively adjusting ear pieces as they prepare to wage cyber war. The all-seeing IDF can’t possibly miss this time, you think. But they miss this time. And the next time. Until this time is the last episode of the season, in which case, they don’t.


  It’s all quite pat, but I fall for it reliably — just like I did when Pablo Escobar escaped the clutches of the DEA for the hundredth time. No other show reliably spikes my blood pressure quite like “Fauda.”(Whether that’s a wise form of recreation for a man in his 40s during a public health crisis is a topic for another time.)


  No matter how many times I see Doron and company do their thing, I find myself digging nails into the fabric of the couch. For the half-season the team was in Gaza, I nearly tore the cushions to shreds. (Gaza is way scarier than the West Bank — trust me on this.)


  There’s a million things wrong with this show, but ignore them all. You’ll thank me for it, even if your cardiologist won’t.

If other giant companies follow suit, tech employment could start to shift away from expensive hubs like Silicon Valley, Seattle and New York. The option to work from home could also provide more reason for tech workers who complain that their enviable salaries still aren’t enough to buy a home in San Francisco or San Jose to consider settling in other parts of the country.                                                                 Zuckerberg’s announcement followed similar decisions at Twitter and the payments company Square, both led by Jack Dorsey. Dorsey said last week that employees at his companies would be allowed to work from home indefinitely. At Google, employees have been told they can work from home through the end of the year, but the company has not made any indications about permanent plans.

Because our mouths are swimming in bacteria, Wolf explained. Most of that bacteria is left over from the food we eat, and it hides between our our teeth, under our gums, on the back of our tongue and in our sinuses, Wolff said. There is also natural bacteria that lives in our mouth all of the time. So when we breathe, the moist — and sometimes fetid — air hits our masks. And as this air evaporates, it leaves behind a stench that when it hits the mask shoots right back up into our nostrils. Yuck.


  Most of the time, halitosis can be cured by focusing on basic oral hygiene. Take the time to floss in the morning and at night, Wolff says. Brush your teeth three times a day. Wolff suggests that we also brush our tongues and the sides of our cheeks. And don’t forget a bacteria-killing mouthwash like Listerine.


  If you are, however, noticing your breath is particularly smelly, you may have periodontitis, also known as gum disease. Gum disease is largely preventable and it happens when the bacteria left over from the food we eat lodges deep into the pockets surrounding our gums. This bacteria eats away out our gums, causing our teeth to loosen and eventually fall out. Gum disease releases a sulfurous chemical called methyl mercaptan, that smells like rotten eggs, Wolff says. So when that noxious gas crawls back up into the nostrils, it can be most unpleasant.


  Popping in a breath mint before you don your mask can help, but Wolff says, it only masks the problem. (Pun very much intended.) If you suspect your bad breath is due to gum disease, please visit your dentist as soon as you safely can.


  In the meantime, keep those masks clean, and lay off the garlic and coffee before you go out. Your nose will thank you.

In her testimony in the 2018 trial, Reade was questioned about her degree by Soltesz. She testified that she received a liberal arts degree, as was stated on her résumé provided by the district attorney’s office. “The focus was political science,” she said, according to a trial transcript.                                                                 Reade also told the court that she was currently a substitute teacher but had worked in domestic violence prevention for more than two decades and testified in more than 20 cases. Her career began, she said, in Biden’s office.                                                                 “I was a legislative assistant,” she said, according to the testimony. “He worked on the Violence Against Women Act, the federal act.”                                                                 Staff lists published in 1993 show Reade listed as a staff assistant, a different position from the legislative assistant job she cited in her testimony. Both titles are common in congressional offices, with legislative assistant indicating a slightly more senior post that involves working on policy. In multiple interviews, Reade described her duties as managing the interns, never mentioning any direct work on the Violence Against Women Act.                                                                 In an interview, Soltesz described Reade as “well spoken” and “a good witness on the stand” and said he was impressed by her experience with Biden.                                                                 But both Soltesz and Scott Erdbacher, the lawyer for Vasquez, raised objections to Reade’s testimony, according to the transcript, saying they were skeptical that her work experience qualified her as an expert. The judge overruled them.                                                                 Now Soltesz says he is exploring whether he can reopen his case. On Wednesday evening, he emailed a network of more than 100 public defenders, alerting them to questions about Reade’s background and credibility.                                                                 Monique S. Hill, a lawyer in another domestic violence case in which Reade served as an expert witness, said she also saw grounds to challenge the conviction.                                                                 “Had I had the information that I have now, this case, in my mind, would have gone differently,” said Hill, who served as a public defender.                                                                 The Monterey County chief assistant district attorney, Berkley Brannon, said that if Reade had misrepresented her academic credentials, the office would alert all defense lawyers involved in cases that featured her as an expert.                                                                 “That would absolutely be of concern to us, and it’s something that the defense attorneys would need to know about,” he said. “We don’t want people that we call lying about anything.”                                                                 He said the office would not make any move to contact defense lawyers until it was satisfied that she indeed had not obtained her bachelor’s degree. And, speaking hypothetically, he said that the extent to which a false academic claim would affect the cases she participated in would depend on how material her testimony was to the outcome.                                                                 The 6th District Appellate Program, a state-funded public interest law firm that represents low-income clients in the region, is also reviewing all the cases involving Reade.                                                                 Reade maintains that she has an undergraduate degree, saying the school has no record of her graduating because of special arrangements put in place to protect her from her ex-husband. She sent the Times a screenshot of a transcript showing her with 35 course credits, her department as “BA Completion” and nothing listed under “date conferred” or “degree conferred.” According to the photo, she entered school Oct. 2, 2000.

I don't hear any barking, do you? The last I looked at Canes Venatici, this pair of hunting dogs were quiet as can be. They must be sleeping. After all, the only time I see them is after dark.      Canes Venatici, of course, is a constellation, a small one at that, with only two easily visible stars. This pair is easy to find, right under the Big Dipper's handle.      When I say "under" I mean in respect to how the Big Dipper is usually pictured, like a real kitchen utensil right-side up on a table. In late May/early June in the evening, the Big Dipper is high in the northern sky, seemingly upside down as far as utensils go.      From mid-northern latitudes, like where I hang my hat in Pennsylvania (well, place my hat on the shelf), at around 9 p.m. this time of year, Canes Venatici is virtually straight overhead, in the zenith.      These stars are not bright. That may not sound nice, but I mean in magnitude. The star on the left (as seen on a spring evening), on the east side, is brightest. Cor Coroli is +3 magnitude. About 2 1/2 degrees away is +4 magnitude Chara. (A half-degree covers the apparent width of the full moon.)      Cor Coroli is a fine wide double star, a nice sight in a small telescope. The name means "the heart of Charles"; the star was named by Astronomer Royal Edmund Halley, at the suggestion of Sir Charles Scarborough in memory of King Charles I, the deposed British king.      Cor Coroli is a fine double star, easily resolved with a small telescope. The star system is 110 light-years away.      Chara has a yellow hue and is 42 light-years away.      Amateur astronomers love spotting the several relatively bright galaxies in Canes Venatici. The most well known is the Whirlpool Galaxy, also known as M51. It is close to the last star in the Big Dipper's handle and is seen as a hazy spot in binoculars on a dark night. Telescopes of 6 inches and larger easily show M51 with a companion galaxy early attached. Photographs reveal M51 as a grand spiral galaxy, seen face-on.      Astronomers have detected one of the largest almost-empty regions of space, called the "Great Void," in the general direction of Canes Venatici. Containing few galaxies, the void is over a billion light-years wide. Nothing like some "cosmic elbow room."      Take a look low in the west-northwest in evening twilight, about a half-hour after sunset. The bright planet Venus is accompanied by Mercury, which is not quite as bright, about two degrees to the upper left.      On May 23, the thin crescent moon will be below Venus; on May 24, the thickening crescent moon will to the upper left of these two planets, in line. While visible to unaided eyes, the trio will be stunning in binoculars.      Venus appears as a big, thin crescent in even a small telescope at low power.      First quarter moon is on May 29.   Keep looking up at the stars!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.

Alaska's April unemployment rate was 12.9%, compared with the national rate of 14.7%. It is the highest recorded rate for Alaska since reporting began in 1976, state labor department economist Karinne Wiebold said by email. The state's rate in March was 5.2%, a low.


  But she said comparing the virus-related shock to an oil-price related economic downturn “is like comparing apples and oranges.” The state hit an unemployment rate of 11.2% in 1986, which Wiebold said was the prior high and came during a oil-bust recession.


  Dan Robinson, chief of research and analysis for the department, in a recent report cautioned against reading too much into Alaska's unemployment rate.


  He said state and local rates are produced using models created by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics that “struggle to capture short-term dramatic changes in the labor force, especially in small states with high seasonality like Alaska.”


  Job estimates and unemployment claims could be more helpful measurements in assessing the economy, he said.


  Initial and continued unemployment claims, for the most recent reporting week, were sharply higher than a year ago.

Though they missed the playoffs last season and were never really in the conversation in the larger AFC discussion, the Steelers should be commended for managing to finish 8-8 amid the circumstances. Year one without both Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown brought more challenges than one could anticipate, starting with the loss of Roethlisberger after just two games. James Conner's persistent injury issues didn't help, nor did the loss of Smith-Schuster to injury, causing him to miss four games. The Steelers went from a team led by a future Hall of Famer at quarterback who was working with promising talent at receiver and running back to a team with an offense engineered by a backup handing off and throwing to backups.

Southeastern Conference schools will be able to bring football and basketball players back to campus for voluntary activities starting June 8 at the discretion of each university.


  The SEC’s announcement Friday is the latest sign that a college football season will be launched in some form this fall. The move comes two days after the NCAA Division I Council voted to lift a moratorium on voluntary workouts on campus by football and basketball players, effective June 1.


  Other conferences are expected to follow suit, though decisions could be left to individual schools.


  “At this time, we are preparing to begin the fall sports season as currently scheduled, and this limited resumption of voluntary athletic activities on June 8 is an important initial step in that process,” SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said.


  SEC officials noted any workouts would take place “under strict supervision of designated university personnel and safety guidelines developed by each institution.” They referred to June 8 as the start of “transition period that will allow student-athletes to gradually adapt to full training and sports activity after this recent period of inactivity.”


  Permitted actions are limited by the NCAA to voluntary activities supervised by strength and conditioning personnel.

NEW ORLEANS, La. (WVUE) - “We’ve been locked up in our house for 8 to 10 weeks now, and I travel every week for work. I love to travel for fun also. It’s just sort of a part of our lifestyle,” Juliet Pappalardo said.Juliet Pappalardo, though, hasn’t traveled in months, and even with so much uncertainty about the future of travel, she signed up for a trip to see the Saints play in Las Vegas.“I think this year it means so much more, and to go to a fun city and see a new stadium, it’s even better,” Pappalardo said.She isn’t alone. More than a hundred people have signed up with ‘Tailgate NOLA’ for a package deal to watch the Saints play the Las Vegas Raiders on September 21st for the first game in its new stadium.“We’ve had well over 500 text messages, phone calls, etc,” Daniel Flynn said.For $1750 a person, the company is offering a roundtrip flight to Vegas, 3 night and 4 days at the Paris Hotel, along with tailgate parties and a ticket to the game.“We have a great party set up for Sunday night on the second floor of a pub, and we have a sever hour tailgate for the game,” Flynn said.Still, it’s unclear if there will be large gatherings allowed in September or if the NFL will allow fans in stadiums.“It’s a risk. We don’t know what’s going to happen. I choose to be hopeful that it will by then, that we flatten the curve,” Pappalardo said.“I think you’re always concerned in the back of your head, but you know what, we have to live life. This is it. Let’s go, live, party. It’s Vegas,” Nick Chisesi said.Nick Chisesi says he needs a trip to look forward to, as a way to feel like life is back to normal.Pappalardo says she’ll take all precautions as long as she gets to be there.“If we have to wear masks, if we have to bring Clorox wipes, I’m ok with that. I would do it. We want to make sure that everyone is safe, but it’s a risk we’re willing to take,” Pappalardo said.Daniel Flynn with ‘Tailgate NOLA’ says the company is pretty confident everything will be ok, but they’re prepared just in case.“One hundred percent refund. If they do play the game on September 21st with no fans, we’re still going out there and you’ll have everything included in the package but we’d refund the ticket to the game,” says Flynn.“I’ve been at the grind, been on the front lines, and it’s time to get away. I need a break, and this is the break I’ve been looking for. Vegas, here I come,” Chisesi said.Copyright 2020 WVUE. All rights reserved.

Over its history, the Conference of Presidents has engaged both American and global leaders to discuss the most critical issues facing world Jewry, anti- Semitism and American policy toward the State of Israel. The Conference of Presidents successfully fulfills this role as one entity — even as its members may vigorously disagree internally on particular policies. With today’s fractious political climate in the United States, we often forget that our political opponents can also be our brothers and sisters in arms on the causes we all care about.


  When we take our internal squabbles outside of the Conference of Presidents forum, we endanger the organization’s ability to represent our Jewish community. Conference of Presidents members would be hampered in deliberating honestly and openly if they fear that their words will be used against them or that their viewpoint will be vilified externally.


  The critical role of the Conference of Presidents is jeopardized if its members do not honor the rules of deliberation as they attack each other or undermine each other’s organizations. The more we drag these disagreements into the spotlight, the more we damage American Jewry as a whole.


  The Conference of Presidents’ relevance and importance has grown exponentially from its founding in the 1950s. When Jews around the world are in danger — when they are jailed by authoritarian regimes or threatened by anti-Semitism — the first call is to the Conference of Presidents. It is this umbrella group’s leadership who works behind the scenes tirelessly to protect and save Jewish lives.They leverage relationships across the community to make a difference. These same leaders work with the American administration to understand the plight of Jews and the State of Israel, as well as sharing insights on America with the Israeli government.


  One of the most foundational obligations of the Torah is the mitzvah of “ahavat yisrael,” the love for one’s fellow Jews. I personally have seen how the Conference of Presidents forges ties with key leaders around the world and acts silently to support and protect our brothers and sisters. As leaders representing organizations within the Conference of Presidenets, we must put aside our differences and remember the important role that we all play in supporting the Jewish people. Our disagreements should only make us stronger, not weaken and divide us.

“All good questions and all questions with answers. But not in a position to answer any of them at this point in time,” Daly wrote in an email. “If and when we are in a position to make an announcement, we will try to make sure they are answered in that context.”                                                                 Under the plan proposed by the NHL/NHLPA Return To Play committee, the top four teams in each conference would play each other in a mini-tournament for seeding while the remaining 16 teams face off in a best-of-five series play-in round to set the final 16 to compete for the Stanley Cup.                                                                                                                                                                                                   Games would likely be played without fans present, and the teams grouped in hub cities around the continent. Las Vegas has become the city most mentioned as a potential site, particularly because of its large concentration of hotels that could house numerous teams.                                                                 Other cities mentioned include Columbus, Ohio; Nashville, Tennessee; Raleigh, North Carolina; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Edmonton, Alberta.                                                                                                                                  Should players provide a green light, the plan would go to the league’s board of governors, who would be likely to approve it. The next step would have the Return To Play committee sort out further issues including health and safety protocols.                                                                 Both sides agree there is no ideal plan, while acknowledging the limitations they face because of the uncertainty created by the pandemic. The NHL’s regular season was paused on March 12, with 189 games remaining and its 31 teams having played an uneven number of games.                                                                 “Obviously, it’s not ideal, but I think in a time like this, how can anything be super traditional?” Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Tyson Barrie said this week. “I think we all have to adapt and be willing to adapt and kind of realize that it’s not going to be this perfect, classic NHL playoffs. I think for the situation we’re in, for a year, I think that’s fine.”                                                                 Under the proposed 24-team format, Montreal would be the final team to qualify in the East based on a slim points-percentage margin. With 71 points in 71 games (.500), the Canadiens edge out Buffalo, which had 68 points in 69 games (.493) and would extend the league's longest active playoff drought to a ninth consecutive season.

  TONIGHT AND SATURDAY


  The showers that started Friday morning will continue at times through Saturday night as our pesky low drifts east along the Mason-Dixon Line and eventually out to sea. While it won't be a washout, and it won't rain all of the time, there will be some occasional bouts of steadier rain with a thunderstorm also not entirely out of the question later tonight into Saturday as two-day rainfall totals generally average between 0.25" to 0.50" for most. With that said, there may be some pockets of around 1.0" of rain. Saturday won't be quite as cool as today's 60s, with highs inching up a few degrees into the low 70s by Saturday afternoon.

Indiana's frontcourt depth was already a bit questionable with Smith on the roster, but now with him gone, there could be a case made to add another body from the transfer portal.


  Usually, grad transfers are looking to make the move to help themselves. Most of the time that doesn't mean going to a team for a lesser role. Every once in a while you will get that, but it has to be a perfect match.


  With the amount of talent that is still returning for Indiana, the Hoosiers are not in a need for someone to come in and be a go-to player. Now, that doesn't mean you don't take a look, however.


  Bringing in another big man for 10-12 minutes a game could be helpful, but at what cost? Could it hurt the development of Race Thompson? There is a lot more that goes into finding the right fit than just saying, 'this guy could be helpful'.


  With the NBA Draft and combine expected to be delayed even further, that could mean more names show up in the portal after receiving the feedback they wanted from NBA teams. Until then, I'm not sure this is the route Indiana will go.

Everyone looks forward to tomatoes. We can't wait for the peaches and corn. Some of us even get excited about zucchini. But who gets pumped for kohlrabi? Anyone?      It doesn't help that a kohlrabi plant looks like a snake that recently swallowed a beach ball. The edible part is the swollen section of stem, which tastes like the part of broccoli most people throw away.      Kohlrabi is perhaps most popular with farmers who are looking for some early season variety in their market displays, CSA boxes or farm stands. Thus, kohlrabi finds its way into the fridge and lurks there, for weeks or longer, never spoiling, never letting you off the hook.      If you take the time to peel one you will be rewarded with a crisp, watery bite and a faint hint of spice, like a cross between jicama and a mild radish.      Sliced thickly on a veggie platter next to some dip, kohlrabi may never get a second chance. Sliced thinly or shredded, kohlrabi clings to sauce the way angel hair pasta does, which opens up many possibilities.      My favorite way to use shredded kohlrabi is in som tum, a green papaya salad that is one of the world's favorite Thai dishes. Green papaya are scarce in my parts, and kohlrabi so available I use it instead, along with shredded carrots. Salty, sweet, spicy, acidic, with a bitter garlic pungency and full of umami, this salad has something for every taste bud.      When I was in Bangkok I spent some time seeking out the best som tum I could find, a mission that took me to a certain outdoor market on the edge of the city. I found my way to the section where stall after stall serves nothing but som tum. I bowed to a man with a bandana on his head.      The "som" in som tum refers to its sour taste, while the "tum" mimics the sound of the pounding of a pestle into a mortar. I'm not sure what I told this gentleman, or what he heard me say, but he nodded and smiled. Then he put a handful of small, living crabs into a tall wooden bowl, and started pounding. His heavy wooden pestle went "tum tum tum" on those crabs until they were a paste, to which he added spices and pounded some more. Then he ladled in some fish sauce, generously -- the way you would want someone to add hot fudge to your ice cream.      The som tum maker swapped his pestle for a pair of wooden forks and added shredded green papaya, herbs and, for good measure, more fish sauce. He stirred it all together, scooped the salad into a paper bowl, and handed it to me.      It was a bit fishy, and hot enough to burn a hole in the sun, but the rich array of flavors was dazzling. The beauty of this dish is that it balances flavors so intense, each one would be too overpowering on its own. But together they neutralize each other, like a mutually assured destruction.      I respected that som tum, but between the fish sauce, high heat and mashed up crabs I was in over my head. I didn't take too many bites, but in looking into that abyss I learned something, and returned to my quarters thrilled with my discovery.      Kohlrabi som tum can be an adventure, too, if less cathartic. I call it kohl som, which translates to something like "Thai-style sour kohlrabi."      Kohl Som   • 1 baseball-sized kohlrabi, peeled and grated or shredded (about 3 cups)   • 1 large handful cherry tomatoes, sliced into halves or quarters   • 1 medium carrot, grated (about 1 cup)   • 1 medium-sized clove garlic, pressed or grated   • ½ teaspoon salt   • 1 or more tablespoons fish sauce   • Juice of 1 lime (or 3 tablespoons lime juice)   • Chile flakes, to taste   • Up to 1 tablespoon brown sugar   • 2 green onions, chopped   • ½ cup chopped cilantro (or parsley)   • Optional garnish: 2 tablespoons peanuts, dry roasted in a pan   • Sliced jalapenos, optional      Combine the kohlrabi, carrot, tomatoes, garlic and salt in a mixing bowl. Give the tomatoes a squeeze to crush them a little. Set aside.      Combine the fish sauce, lime juice, sugar and chile flakes, and stir until the brown sugar is fully dissolved. Add this sauce and the green onions, cilantro and jalapenos, if using, to the mixing bowl. Toss the salad in the dressing, a little roughly to crush the tomatoes a bit more, and garnish with the peanuts.

  Some landlords in Toronto whose tenants are struggling to make rent after losing their jobs due to COVID-19 are exerting undue pressure for payment, advocates say, including showing up at their residences with an eviction notice or a machine to take immediate payment.


  For now, that's about all they can do, since the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) that adjudicates on disputes between the parties has postponed eviction orders and proceedings, with only urgent matters being considered via telephone or in writing.


  But with both tenant and landlord groups in Ontario bracing for even more renters to fall into arrears in May, tenant advocates are warning of a wave of evictions once the moratorium is lifted.


  "It is going to be a terrifying bloodbath," warns Geordie Dent, the executive director of the Federation of Metro Tenants' Associations.


  He calculated that renters who fell into arrears in April may have created the justification for some 50,000 landlord applications to the board, compared to the roughly 4,000 it deals with in a typical month.


  "Everyone seems to think May will be worse," he added.


  "We do expect May to be worse," agreed Tony Irwin, the president of the Federation of Rental-Housing Providers of Ontario, noting that his member landlords had reported 10 per cent delinquency in April, a tenfold increase from a typical one-per-cent rate.


  "People may have gone through savings and had no employment income in April to help them pay May rent," he said. "And so while they do get government support, we're concerned that in places like Toronto, where rent is higher than other places, that the support that people are receiving may not be enough."


  The impact of the pandemic and related shutdowns are being felt particularly acutely by younger people, most of whom are renters and are often employed in precarious or part-time work.


  "The rise of the gig economy, which is characterized by independent contractors and freelance workers, has always been problematic," said Bahar Shadpour of the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario. "The pandemic is exposing that vulnerability."


  She added that younger people are also more likely to be single, with single- person dwellings among the most unaffordable.


  While monthly rental rates for a one-bedroom unit in Toronto did decline in May, the average asking price was still more than $2,100, according to data from rentals.ca.


  That is more than the $2,000-a-month emergency payments the federal government has made available to people who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic.


  Premier Doug Ford said in late April that he would ask the federal government to work with the province on a residential rent relief program, but none has so far been forthcoming.


  Ottawa has, however, launched a rent relief program for small businesses and is encouraging commercial landlords to take part in it.


  Irwin said that while the landlord group was focused on responding to the emergency for now, they are also eyeing the LTB's eventual return.


  "At some point down the road, we're certainly going to be looking to the government to reopen the tribunal in some way," he said, with landlords in the meantime typically arranging for unpaid rent to be repaid over three to 12 months.


  Tenant advocates are meanwhile calling for measures to ensure the crisis does not lead to a wave of evictions, which would allow landlords to then charge new tenants even higher rents.


  "In the absence of rent forgiveness and/or a prohibition against eviction on the basis of late rent during the months of the crisis, there will be mass evictions," said Cole Webber, who works at Parkdale Community Legal Services.


  Some 865,000 people across Canada have signed an online petition calling on the federal government to cancel residential rent and mortgage payments for the duration of the pandemic.


  Melissa Jean-Baptiste, a staff lawyer at Kensington-Bellwoods Community Legal Services, said those falling into arrears are being threatened, but she is not seeing more legal filings.


  "The filing costs $190, so if they (landlords) don't think they will get a hearing anytime soon, they may be holding off," she said, adding landlords are still pushing tenants on notices to vacate that were posted before the pandemic.


  A spokesperson for Tribunals Ontario, which oversees provincial tribunals including the LTB, has not responded to queries the National Observer first posed on May 8 about whether it had seen a spike in applications from landlords whose tenants had fallen behind since the pandemic.


  Jean-Baptiste said some of her clients are paying $800 a month in rent- controlled housing that could bring in $2,500 in today's market, and that she is advising them to pay whatever they can to put them in good stead if and when their landlord tries to move them out.


  "There are some landlords that are licking their lips and hoping people fall into arrears," she said. "If they can get them out, they don't even have to go through the whole renoviction process," she added, referring to a landlord's argument that major renovations require a tenant to move out, at which point, they can reset the rental price.


  Benjamin Ries, of Downtown Legal Services, said he has been hearing a lot of complaints about landlord entry at rental properties during the pandemic. While landlords have been advised not to do inspections or show properties now, he has had to tell worried tenants that if either side had provided notice to vacate prior to the pandemic, then regular provincial rules around access remain in place.


  Likewise, with residential construction broadly excluded from shutdowns. Tenants have little recourse when landlords decide to continue with renovation and repair work, which would, in normal times, be done during business hours when most people are not in their residences.


  "It's a head-scratcher why that's continued," Ries said. "The government's approach to keeping that going has made tenants prisoners."


  He said his clinic, which caters to both low-income renters and students, has heard from students being asked to pay rent for the rest of the school year or not getting their security deposit back even if the pandemic has forced them to move out or even leave the country, in the case of international students.


  He's been fielding a lot of questions about whether they can break their lease early or get a reduction in rent, he said, "and the answer is usually no."


  Ries also wondered about how the ongoing effects of the pandemic will change housing for the next school year, which is likely to largely be conducted online.


  "If students find out they don't have to rent in Toronto, what does that mean for those that have already signed leases?"
