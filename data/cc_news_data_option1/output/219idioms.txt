Most stars appear white to the eye, although a closer look will reveal hints of blue, yellow, orange and red. What about green?      Alas, astronomers say there are no green stars, but I still find it hard to believe.      Most stars appear white to the eye, but that is primarily because our retinas are not sensitive to color in low light conditions. In a backyard telescope, beautiful swathes of stellar clouds, such as the Great Nebula in Orion (M42, visible in the south in mid-March evenings just below the famous three "belt stars" of Orion), appear white. Long exposure color photographs bring out vivid colors, which can do a disservice to the stargazer if one expects the same thing at the telescope eyepiece.      Brighter colored stars do stand out in shades of blue, yellow, orange and red. Many others still appear white. With the unaided eye, you can appreciate the orange-red star Betelgeuse on the upper left corner of Orion, or the bright yellow star Capella high overhead. Brilliant Sirius gleams to the lower left of Orion and is distinctly bluish-white. Aim binoculars at the outer, top tip of the Big Dipper "bowl," which is named Dubhe and is vivid orange.      Stars vary in color with their surface temperature and are classified by "spectral types" listing stars by letters. Cooler stars with spectral types K or M radiate most of their energy in the red end of the spectrum. Hotter stars, such as spectral types O and B, emit mostly at blue and ultraviolet wavelengths. Our sun is of spectral type G and is yellowish-white.      Spectroscopes reveal the stellar spectrum, and in the rainbow of light, there is always a component of green! Even if the star's light is predominantly another shade, there is still green light! Unfortunately, our eyes do not perceive a star as green because those with the right temperature to mainly emit green light, emit starlight in a manner that is blended by our eye as white.      Spectrums of stars also reveal dark lines where elements making up the star - such as hydrogen or helium - absorb narrow frequencies of the light, which show up as thin dark lines in the color. Like a fingerprint, astronomers are able to learn the chemical makeup of stars and other celestial bodies this way.      Occasionally we can even see green sunlight. When the conditions are right at sunset or sunrise, a green spot of light is visible above the upper rim of the disk of the sun. Called the "green flash," it normally is seen for no more than a second or two. On rare occasions, it has been seen like a green ray shooting up from the point of sunset or sunrise.      The green flash is caused by refraction, with the component colors of the sunlight split. Green flashes are more likely to be seen in stable, clean air, when more of the light of the low sun reaches the observer's eyes without being scattered in the atmosphere. They usually are seen on a flat horizon such as over the ocean.      Now, where are the purple stars?      What about the planets? The Earth has lots of green. The planet Uranus has a bluish-green hue as a result of methane in its atmosphere. Venus, so bright in the evening sky (look southwest), is really white.      Last quarter moon occurred Jan. 17-18. After this, watch for the early morning crescent, waning towards new moon on Jan. 24. The moon, by the way, is also not green despite the cheese it's supposed to be made of.

 E3 is the biggest video game trade show of the year, so when Sony announced that they were skipping last year's event, no press conference and no booths set up so the public and media could get hands-on with their upcoming titles, it was a little surprising.
 Surprising, but at the same time it kind of made sense. Because they showed so much of their lineup early at the 2018 E3 press conference, last year's show would have featured mostly the same titles. And it was much too soon for them to really go into detail about the PlayStation 5 launching this holiday.
 But this year, Sony has a lot to talk about. The PlayStation 5 is coming out this year, and with it will be a new controller, new games, a new online store and a new user interface that gamers are all interested in.
 So when Sony announced earlier this week they were once again skipping E3, I was shocked. The PlayStation 4 has completely dominated this console generation. Although Microsoft hasn't announced Xbox One sales numbers in years, games analysts believe Sony has outsold Microsoft by about 2-1 this generation.
 It might not have been a knockout punch, but Sony landed a huge haymaker against Microsoft at E3 2013 that led the way for PlayStation to recapturing the market lead. At that E3, Microsoft focused their press conference on all the multimedia features of the Xbox One, how it could replace your cable box and be the place you watch movies, TV and live sports. And that it was going to cost $500. Sony followed that up a few hours later focusing on games and announcing a $400 price point.
 It still looks like Microsoft is going to host their press conference at E3 and be on the show floor showing off the Xbox Series X, so more than likely they will dominate the gaming headlines in early June.
 Sony has teased some details about the PlayStation 5 through some exclusive articles with Wired magazine, but my expectation is for them to do a big reveal on the system before E3. The PlayStation 4 was formally announced at an event in February 2013, more details were released that June at E3 and the system launched in November of that year.
 Only time will tell if skipping E3 will end up being a mistake.   Dusty Ricketts is the editor of The Destin Log and The Walton Sun newspapers and can be reached at dricketts@thedestinlog.com.

"This match was unreal," said world number 18 Rublev.
 "I don't know how I won. I lost myself a bit when I trailed 2-0 (third set). I told myself to start again, breathe and fight for every point."
 \- 'It makes me feel old' -
 Barty took a while to get going against 27th-ranked American Collins who dominated the opening set.
 But the second was a different story, with top seed Barty quickly finding her game to level the match.
 The third set went to a tie-break after the players traded breaks of serve.
 Barty lost a 4-2 lead in the breaker, but won on her second match point as a Collins return clipped the top of the net.
 "I worked hard tonight, and we got the result that we're after," she said. "I felt I had a lot of clarity with what I wanted to do.
 "Danielle has the ability to take the match out of your hands a little bit."
 Barty beat Yastremska in their only previous meeting last March in Miami.
 "Dayana brings a lot of variety to her game, she's an exceptional ball- striker. All of these young girls are hitting so hard, it makes me feel old," the 23-year-old said.
 \- Harris reaches first final -
 Yastremska thrashed world number 20 Donna Vekic in the quarter-finals and was a set up against former Australian Open winner Angelique Kerber when the German retired from their last-16 match with back pain.
 Ranked 24th, Yastremska is bidding for the fourth title of her career.
 Harris, 22, will be competing in his first ATP final.
 "To be honest, it doesn't seem real now," he said. "It was a tough match for both of us, we were both nervous.
 "I tried to lift my level, but it was a difficult match all in all, one of those days where I felt like I wasn't at 100 percent.
 "I wasn't playing my best, but somehow I managed to battle through it - that was amazing for me."
 Harris needed two hours and 11 minutes to advance past the American, firing 13 aces and breaking four times while losing his own serve twice.

GRAHAM -- The Graham City Council's first meeting of 2020 ended with an unexpected closed session and a cryptic announcement of a police investigation.
   
 "We will turn over a criminal investigation to [Police] Chief [Jeff] Pritchard under state statute 14-234," Mayor Jerry Peterman said Tuesday, Jan. 14, "and that will go to the chief and come to a resolution one way or the other after the chief does his stuff."
   
 That statute refers to "public officers or employees benefiting from public contracts."
   
 Council member Jennifer Talley, returned to the council in November after 10 years, requested the council go into an unscheduled closed session at the end of the regular meeting to discuss a potential investigation with the city attorney. The request seemed to surprise the rest of the council, but City Attorney Bob Ward said the discussion should be heard in private.
   
 Ironically, Talley had just requested the council consider a policy to do a better job letting the public know when it would be considering items for votes. Talley said she had asked to put several items on this month's agenda, but was told she could add only one because of time constraints.
   
 "I don't like it either," Talley said. "What other choice do I have?"
   
 While no one said who or what the police were being asked to investigate, former City Council member Lee Kimrey told the Times-News on Wednesday he suspected it was about him. In December, Kimrey asked the council to investigate allegations people have made against him about a small lot at Pine and Goley streets near Graham Middle School, where he plans to build and sell a house.
   
 Kimrey and Peterman told the Times-News in December the city needed an easement on the property for a sidewalk. Rather than buy the easement for cash, the city manager and public works director made a verbal agreement with the property owner at the time, Jim Albright, also a former council member, to clear and grade the lot in exchange for the easement.
   
 After that agreement was made, Kimrey said, Albright approached him about buying the lot. They made a subordination agreement wherein Albright would be paid for the lot once the house was built and sold.
   
 Kimrey said he believed the police investigation would clear him.
   
 911 changes
   
 The council voted 4-1, with newly elected council member Ricky Hall voting "no," to enter a contract with Burlington to have its Burlington Emergency Communications Center dispatch Graham's emergency services, instead of renewing its contract with Alamance County Central Communication.
   
 "I believe this move will be a disservice to the city and our city residents," Hall said before hearing from the police and fire chiefs. "I don't feel like it's in the best interest of our city to make this move."
   
 The contract with Burlington would be significantly more expensive than the current contract with the county -- $253,000 plus $77,800 for installation, versus $130,000 to stay with the county. But both Pritchard and Graham Fire Chief Tommy Cole said Burlington's dispatch works on a Greensboro-based communications system called TRON (Triad Regional Operability Network) that has much better reception in the city, and especially inside buildings, than the county's dispatch, which is based on the 20-year-old VIPER system.
   
 Firefighters have gone into buildings and lost radio contact while thinking they could still reach command outside if needed to call for help, Cole said.
   
 "That scares me, and it should scare every one of you," Cole said.
   
 Police Lt. Duane Flood told the council he responded to a shooting Jan. 6 at The Pines Apartments on Ivey Street, and had radio problems while he was tending to the victim who had been shot in the head.
   
 "I needed to relay info to C-Com to make sure we're getting the proper medical response that we need," Flood told the council. "I'm standing there with this individual with my radio, and as soon as I key up, I 'bonk'" -- meaning he couldn't make contact because that area has a "dead spot."
   
 Flood said he had to walk about 20 feet from the victim, hold his radio up in the air and shout at it to make contact.
   
 City Manager Frankie Maness said he had hoped the conversation would focus on the quality of service rather than the cost, and that just looking at the difference in the cost of the two contracts was a failure to understand the city's "comingled budget."
   
 Considering the contract with Burlington would reduce in price over the next few years, Maness said, and the contract with the county is expected to get more expensive, combined with changes in other cost-sharing agreements with the county, like Animal Services or the library, and declining workers' compensation premium costs, the net cost actually was much lower than it looked.
   
 "When you combine those things, the real cost to the city is about $45,000," Maness said.
   
 Talley said a county commissioner had contacted her, saying there would be a variety of problems with changing the system, and that she was concerned about Graham's emergency personnel being able to communicate with other agencies.
   
 Cole, who previously ran a 911 dispatch center in another county, said the city's radios could switch back and forth easily from TRON to VIPER frequencies.
   
 The changeover should happen this summer.
   
 Master plan
   
 The item Talley did get on the council's agenda was revisiting the city's controversial downtown master plan. She said Hall's and her opposition to the plan, which the council approved Nov. 5, was the reason voters put them on the council the same day.
   
 "It was my understanding after we won the election we would have the votes to rescind the plan," Talley said. "I'm getting some push back on that from some council members."
   
 Peterman and council member Chip Turner voted against adopting the plan in November, but said they did not want to start the whole process up again.
   
 "If we rescind the plan now, we'll still need to have something in place," Peterman said.
   
 Upgrading downtown's stormwater and sewer systems ahead of the state Department of Transportation's repaving of N.C. 87 -- Main Street -- was the main reason the council hired Maryland-based Toole Design Group to develop a small-area plan for Graham's infrastructure. The DOT will give the city some say in how the work is done and time to upgrade the underground infrastructure before repaving, which would be much cheaper, but only if there is a plan from a recognized group like Toole. Otherwise downtown would be tied up once for repaving and again in two or three years for infrastructure upgrades.
   
 The plan also included ideas and drawings for a slower, greener downtown with less parking and loading zones on Court Square. That turned off a number of downtown business, and images of Court Square with more trees, fewer parking spaces and small parks in the corners triggered a public backlash.
   
 Peterman and Turner said they agreed the plan needed some changes like leaving downtown parking unchanged, Peterman said, and not planting a lot of trees, Turner said, which the council could take on gradually. Council member Melody Wiggins said it was too early to change the plan, and the council would have plenty of opportunities to tweak things in the coming years as different projects come up.
   
 "I know that's the truth if this plan is rescinded," Talley said, "and puts the other side in a situation where they have to work with the new people to be able to pass something."
   
 The council members, other than Wiggins, agreed to instruct county staff not to move forward on any of the above-ground proposals or seek any grants based on the master plan without coming to the council first.

Emily has since skied with her family at Mammoth Mountain in Mammoth Lakes as well as at Brian Head and Eagle Point ski resorts in southern Utah. She even raced her mom, Amy, to the bottom of a slope. “And I won!” Emily said with a giggle. “It was really funny, because she’s usually way better than me.”
 Willemse said she and her husband learned to ski at Snow Valley when their kids took up the sport. Three of her four offspring are still skiing and daughter Traci — a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who now teaches Marines how to fly Cobra attack helicopters in San Diego — became a ski instructor.
 For true novices, instructors begin by teaching them how to put on skis before advancing to the Magic Carpet lift (something like a moving sidewalk) to try out an easy run. Students might not get to ride a chair lift until the second if not the third week, she said.
 “You can take any kid to the top of a hill,” she said. “They’ll probably get down, but if they can’t control their speed, or turn or know how to stop, you’ve got a problem — and it may not be pretty. They may get hurt or never want to ski again. So lessons are really the way to go.”

Like an internet meme -- for example, that viral stock image of an indignant women staring at her boyfriend in disbelief as he looks at another woman -- it's the template that lodges itself in the public consciousness rather than any one particular instance. What's funny are the clever tweaks on the formula we've all seen to exhaustion.
 Of course, the iteration critical to TikTok also makes it impossible to understand at a glance. Many people were introduced to the app by way of "Kombucha Girl" Brittany Broski, whose reaction to tasting drink for the first time went viral across platforms. The problem is that in isolation her video is not at all representative of content on TikTok. The only thing about the video truly typical of TikTok are the thousands of videos made in its wake, using its audio.
 But wait, you might ask, what about all the dancing? It doesn't take long, scrolling through TikTok, to stumble on some eager 15-year-old girl performing an elaborate routine in her bedroom after school. Keep going and and you'll find thousands of other girls running through practically indistinguishable moves.
 Viral dance challenges have been around much longer than TikTok. Think Harlem Shake or, pre-internet, the Macarena. Now, however, a dance craze can start with almost anyone and spread with dizzying speed. Late last year, 10 seconds of amateur choreography performed to Madcon’s 2007 song “Beggin” was picked up by tens of thousands of teenagers. A fast-paced routine set to an obscure beat by K Camp, mostly involving hand gestures, has been copied in clips from locations such as the Louvre, in front of the Mona Lisa.

At the end of the day, no matter the purpose these tattoos serve, all tattoos end up being a part of a person’s identity and even those of a more traditional or cultural context were once originally made to express something.

We hadn't had the new microwave that long when, all of a sudden, it decided it just didn't want to microwave anymore.      "You had one job," I said to the microwave, chastising it after it failed to reheat some leftovers. "Is that really so hard?"      Naturally, I had no idea what went into making a microwave microwave. I assumed it probably had something to do with the sun, since it used microwaves, and maybe also radio waves or ultraviolet rays, and therefore there was surely a solar panel installed somewhere, that made it work, as well as a transistor radio and sunscreen. Since I had no experience with microwaves or radio waves or UV waves (except that one time when I was seven and I got a really bad sunburn), I thought this was all well out of my limited range of appliance repair knowledge and decided to call in a professional.      I looked online for a repairman in my area and chose Mike's Microwave repair because it had a number of good reviews and also, Mike and Microwave both begin with an M and I like alliteration. I had to wait two weeks for Mike to show up because apparently, there was a sudden epidemic of microwave deaths at the same time that mine pooped out. It was like some kind of microwave flu that must have been transmitted over the airwaves, or maybe the radio waves, I couldn't be certain.      By the time Mike finally arrived I was beside myself. I was a child of the microwave generation and never realized that food could also be reheated in an actual oven, so for two weeks I ate cold leftovers and brooded about how difficult life was without a microwave.      "I think it might be the fuse," said Mike when he finally arrived and did triage on my microwave. "It should be an easy fix, but there's a chance I might have to do open oven surgery. I need you to sign a release."      "A release?" I said. "For what?"      "Acknowledging that the appliance was not functioning when I arrived and nothing I did caused it to further malfunction."      "Fine," I said and signed the form. "But before you do anything, you should try pointing the satellite dish in a different direction to see if that solves the problem, because not only is the microwave broken, but also, our TV isn't getting very good reception."      He looked at me like I was one burner short of stovetop. "They have nothing to do with each other."      "What?" I said.      "Your microwave and your TV," he said. "Completely unrelated."      "Got it," I said. "But could you check the TV when you're done with the microwave, anyway?"      "I only do kitchen appliances," he said.      "But the TV is in the kitchen," I replied. Then I recalled that the ad said, Mike's Microwaves, and not Mike's Microwaves and TVs, so I decided to let it go.      I watched the one TV channel that worked well while Mike did surgery on the microwave. But when I decided to switch channels, all of a sudden, at the exact same time, the microwave whirred to life.      "Hah!" I yelled. "I fixed the microwave!"      "No, you didn't," said Mike. "I did. I put in a new fuse."      "I'm not so sure, Mike." I said assuredly. "I was on CNN and when I switched to HGTV, the microwave started to work again."      "I told you, they're not related," he argued.      I shrugged. "If you want to believe that, that's fine," I said. "I don't want to make waves."

Nine-year-old Avery Norbryhn can ski backward, which is no small feat. The fourth grader has also mastered jumps at her local hill, Snow Valley Mountain Resort, in the San Bernardino Mountains about 90 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. One day in the not-too-distant future, she says she’s going to be able to keep up with, and maybe even out-ski, her 40-year-old dad, Robert.
 Both learned how to ski at Snow Valley’s Rim Youth ski and snowboard program, which aims to teach very young kids their way around the slopes.
 “I started learning in the program when I was 6, way back when I was a kindergartner,” said Robert Norbryhn, now a ski instructor. He grew up in Running Springs, moved to Idaho for a while, but returned to the area seven years ago. He and his wife have four children, three of whom will participate in the program this winter. Norbryhn also helps out as a chaperone, sometimes helping the youngest children get on and off the lifts.
 “I skied as many as three times a week with friends and family growing up, often with my dad,” he said. “It was my life during winters. And for lots of my friends too. I recall sitting in the back of my parents’ old [Chevrolet] Suburban and changing on the way up to the resort. Most of the instructors back then were parents and other volunteers. One was a pastor at a local church.”

GRAHAM -- Gov. Roy Cooper marked a milestone with a grant for community college students' living expenses at Alamance Community College because ACC was one of the first schools to make sure students got it.
   
 "We want to show the rest of the country, and the world, that North Carolina gets it," Cooper said Thursday, Jan. 16, in the Advanced Applied Technology Center at ACC, "that education is the key to opportunity; it is the key to hope for families."
   
 Cooper was celebrating 3,000 of the grants being awarded so far. 122 of them at ACC paying, according to ACC President Algie Gatewood, 346 bills totaling $124,162.
   
 Finish Line grants have been around for almost a year and a half. They are up to $1,000 for students half way through their studies to get degrees or credentials, who run into financial hardships that could keep them from finishing their educations. Eligible expenses include child care, housing, medical expenses, dependent care and car repair.
   
 They became available in September 2018, Cooper said, and ACC had students putting in applications that October like a "duck on a junebug," he said.
   
 Rosalyn Chambers is on track to graduate in June with a double major in office administration and office legal office administration. When she had a tooth abscess that turned into a root canal her determination to finish her degree and move onto a better career ran into a hard real-life obstacle. She was in class, but, in a lot of pain and at a real health risk, struggling. Another student told her about the Finish Line Grant and she qualified the same day.
   
 "Without that grant, I'm not sure what I would have done because that was not a situation that could be ignored," Chambers said.
   
 Andrew Hann is a nursing student supporting a wife and young children. A young man, he was perhaps lucky enough to have a car problem rather than a health problem, but money is money, and it was enough to make him decide whether or not he could keep up his demanding course load and part-time work schedule to graduate on time to provide a better life for his young family or take time away from all that to take care of his family's transportation short term.
   
 "I didn't have to make a decision about putting food on the table, paying this bill or whatnot," Hann said. "It was a huge blessing."
   
 Cooper, like local Republican legislators in town this week, did not miss an opportunity to take a shot at the opposition.
   
 "We put this in our budget for the General Assembly for Finish Line grants for community colleges and universities," Cooper said. "The general Assembly said 'no,' so we were able to find some federal money to get this program started. We could only use it for community colleges because of the nature of the federal money."
   
 Cooper said the program's success made him think it might be copied in other states.
   
 After the presentation on the grants, Cooper answered reporters' questions, which focused on the ongoing budget crisis. Cooper didn't show any signs he wanted to change his position.
   
 "What you have now is a legislature that wants to keep cutting corporate taxes, and North Carolina has some of the lowest corporate taxes of any state," Cooper said. "We don't need that, we need long-term investments in public education; we need meaningful raises for teachers."

E3 is the biggest video game trade show of the year, so when Sony announced that they were skipping last year's event, no press conference and no booths set up so the public and media could get hands-on with their upcoming titles, it was a little surprising.      Surprising, but at the same time it kind of made sense. Because they showed so much of their lineup early at the 2018 E3 press conference, last year's show would have featured mostly the same titles. And it was much too soon for them to really go into detail about the PlayStation 5 launching this holiday.      But this year, Sony has a lot to talk about. The PlayStation 5 is coming out this year, and with it will be a new controller, new games, a new online store and a new user interface that gamers are all interested in.      So when Sony announced earlier this week they were once again skipping E3, I was shocked. The PlayStation 4 has completely dominated this console generation. Although Microsoft hasn't announced Xbox One sales numbers in years, games analysts believe Sony has outsold Microsoft by about 2-1 this generation.      It might not have been a knockout punch, but Sony landed a huge haymaker against Microsoft at E3 2013 that led the way for PlayStation to recapturing the market lead. At that E3, Microsoft focused their press conference on all the multimedia features of the Xbox One, how it could replace your cable box and be the place you watch movies, TV and live sports. And that it was going to cost $500. Sony followed that up a few hours later focusing on games and announcing a $400 price point.      It still looks like Microsoft is going to host their press conference at E3 and be on the show floor showing off the Xbox Series X, so more than likely they will dominate the gaming headlines in early June.      Sony has teased some details about the PlayStation 5 through some exclusive articles with Wired magazine, but my expectation is for them to do a big reveal on the system before E3. The PlayStation 4 was formally announced at an event in February 2013, more details were released that June at E3 and the system launched in November of that year.      Only time will tell if skipping E3 will end up being a mistake.   Dusty Ricketts is the editor of The Destin Log and The Walton Sun newspapers and can be reached at dricketts@thedestinlog.com.

Some credit goes to a Titans defense that limited the Ravens' trio of talented tight ends, favorite targets of Jackson. More credit goes to Derrick Henry, who rumbled for 195 rushing yards in his third straight 180-plus-yard game. Henry averaged an impressive 6.5 yards per carry on 30 attempts against a stout Ravens defensive line that knew what was coming and couldn't do anything about it. As NFL On CBS analyst Jay Feely notes, "with Derrick Henry, you have a guy that's almost 6'5″ 250 pounds, runs a 4.4 40 but has lateral quickness and the ability and explosiveness when he makes that lateral move, that's really tough to stop."
