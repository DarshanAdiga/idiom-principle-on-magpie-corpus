The dollar was higher, while the euro came under pressure from data showing inflation in the eurozone fell in March on a slump in energy prices caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
 "China provided Western investors with a light at the end of the tunnel," said Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex trading group.
 China's manufacturing sector saw surprise growth in March, having been mauled in February as the country went into lockdown to tackle the virus.
 China's Purchasing Managers'Index, a key gauge of factory activity, jumped to 52.0 from a record low 35.7 the month before. Anything above 50 is considered growth. China is slowly returning to a semblance of normal life after months of tough restrictions which locked up millions of people at home and brought economic activity to a near standstill.
 "Chinese factory data overnight gave a flicker of hope that the world's second largest economy is firing back up, despite large parts of the world grinding to a halt," said City Index analyst Fiona Cincotta.
 However the World Bank has warned that fallout from the coronavirus pandemic could bring China's growth to a standstill, with even a best-case scenario seeing expansion slow to 2.3 % this year from 6.1% in 2019.
 Trillions of dollars pledged to offset the economic impact of the deadly virus have provided a semblance of stability to world markets, which were initially pummelled by the rapid spread of the disease, which has forced swathes of the planet — and the economy — into lockdown.
 While the number of infections and deaths continues to rise, observers said traders appear to be getting used to the new normal, with some suggesting the sell-off in stocks may have seen its worst. After another rally on Wall Street, which saw all three main indices jump more than three% Monday, Asia picked up the baton.
 Hong Kong climbed 1.9% while Mumbai and Manila climbed more than three% Tuesday.
 Shanghai edged up 0.1% and Wellington added more than one%.
 But Sydney reversed early advances to end down two%, having soared seven% Monday on its best day in history. Tokyo finished 0.9% lower Tuesday.
 "As far as the coronavirus is concerned, China is the blueprint of what to expect, and once traders get the impression a country's crisis is at or approaching the peak, then more bulls might be coaxed back into the market," said David Madden at CMC Markets. But there were warnings of a wave of desperately bad figures to come from around the world and Gorilla Trades strategist Ken Berman said stock markets continued to be hostage to uncertainty.

France on Tuesday reported its highest daily number of deaths from COVID-19 since the coronavirus epidemic began, saying 499 more people had died in hospital to bring the toll to 3,523. There are now 22,757 people hospitalised in France with COVID-19, with 5,565 of them in intensive care, health official Jerome Salomon told reporters in his daily update. French health authorities reported 499 new deaths from coronavirus on Tuesday, taking the total to 3,523, an increase of 17% in the past 24 hours. It was the third consecutive day that the rate of deaths accelerated in France, which is now in its third week of lockdown to try to slow the spread of the virus. The daily government tally only accounts for those dying in hospital but authorities say they will very soon be able to compile data on deaths in retirement homes, which is likely to result in a big increase in registered fatalities. State health agency director Jerome Salomon told a news conference that the number of cases had risen to 52,128, a rise of 17% in 24 hours, probably due to the fact that France has been ramping up testing Salomon said 5,565 people were in a serious condition needing life support, up 9% compared to Monday, a rate of increase slightly slower compared to previous days. The health system is struggling to cope with the pace of the outbreak. France has increased the number of beds in intensive care units from 5,000 to about 10,000 since the start of the crisis and it is scrambling to reach 14,500. In the morning hours, President Emmanuel Macron visited a factory producing medical masks to both show support and announce an additional €4 billion ($4.4 billion) to fund the production of masks, respirators, and supplies. The production of masks will reach 15 million per week by end of April, Macron promised. The factory Macron visited, PME Kolmi-Hopen, is the largest of four companies in France producing surgical and filtering face masks. They are operating round-the- clock to meet the demand. An Air France cargo plane also landed at Paris-Vatry Airport on Tuesday carrying 10 million masks purchased from China for nationwide use. Additional medical supplies were also on board. After first appearing in Wuhan, China, last December, the virus has spread to at least 179 countries and regions, according to the U.S-based Johns Hopkins University database. More than 826,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported worldwide, with the death toll over 40,700 and over 174,000 recoveries. Despite the severity of the virus, most people experience mild symptoms and recover in due time.

How are you doing? You are home with the kids. Today is the first day that I actually brushed my hair and put on some makeup. I've had kylie, the only sister that I've seen, I had her come over and do my makeup because she's so much better at it than me because we're all really taking this extremely seriously. We haven't seen any sisters, and let me say, being at home with four kids, if I ever thought for a minute that I wanted another one, that is out the door. It's really tough. I can only imagine. Now, a lot of couples are struggling with all of the time that they now have to spend with each other. I'm spending a lot more time with my husband in particular. How are you and Kanye handling all this time together, Kim? I actually love that time because we do travel so much in our regular world that this has been -- I think the family bonding part of it all, going on walks outside, we've watched every single movie you could possibly imagine, I've been showing the kids all these '80s movies like "Harry and the Hendersons" that they wouldn't watch and it's so much fun. I love the bonding stuff but I've been doing laundry and cooking and we're now -- the kids just got on spring break, thank god. Being their teacher too, my newfound respect for teachers, they deserve so much. It's been tough juggling it all and you really have to put yourself on the back burner and just focus on the kids. Kim, this is Sara. Now, you have a really big and close family and I always love talking to you about that as one of four kids myself. You usually see each other all the time. What has it been like to be separated for all these weeks? It's been really hard. I mean, we do zoom dinners where we all get on, you know, all make our plate and then have dinner and talk. We're on a group family chat all the time facetiming my grandma, my sisters. It has been really challenging. It was just really good to see kylie this morning just even for a second when she was doing my makeup and even just everything we wanted to catch up on. Our kids haven't S This is breaking news from channel 7 eyewitness news. And good morning. Hello. I'm David novarro. I'm Shirleen allicot. New York's governor is giving an update on the coronavirus pandemic. All in search of the apex and the other side of the mountain, but we are still headed up the mountain. Number of people tested last night was a near record amount. We tested over 18,000 people. We are testing more people than any state in the country and I'm very proud of that. More per capita than China and South Korea. Total number of people tested, 200,000. Population of 19 million. It's not going to give you a random sample, but it's been helping us track down the positive cases. Number of positive cases, 9,298, total cases 75,000 cases. You see the predominance in new York City, then westchester, then Nassau, then suffolk, then rockland. So you can see it's that area of density. It spreads out from that area of density. The March of coronavirus, of course, in the state of new York continues. Down to just two counties that don't have a case. The overall numbers, 75,000 have tested positive, 10,000 people in our hospitals. 2700icu2700 icu patients. So people come in, they get treated, they go home. Excuse me. New York is at 75,000 cases. Next data 16,000, California is so you can see New York is a magnitude of difference more than any other state. 1550 deaths. That's up from 1218 yesterday. Again, we are studying the charts, we are trying to study the data, follow the data. The data is uneven. It bounces. Numbers often bounce in any model. There are variables in this model. The hospitals are reporting it. So what every hospital reported that day, were they busy or were they combining a couple of days in one? It's an imperfect reporting mechanism. The basic line is still up. What the statisticians will tell you is you basically draw the state line that the columns indicate and we are still going up, which is what we see on the overall trajectory. That was still going on. Number of intubations was down, not much, but it was down, and that's a good sign. You also see the number of discharges going up and that's consistent. The longer people are in, they either get treated and leave or they get put on a ventilator and the longer you're on a ventilator, the less likelihood you will come off the ventilator. That's the blunt truth of this situation. We have two missions overall that we are pursuing. One is the front line of this battle is our hospital system. That's what this is going to come down to. The second is social responsibility, stay at home. Don't get infected in the first don't get infected in the first place because it goes back to you're creating a burden on our healthcare system that healthcare system cannot handle. We are talking about exceeding the capacity of our hospital system by some estimates two times. So what does this come down to besides all the other issues? It comes down to not overwhelming the hospital system because those people who need acute care may not be able to get the acute care. So it's all about the hospital system. That is the front line. What we are doing is we are following the mathematical projections of the experts. We are speaking to all the

The latest album from this Bay Area jazz-funk combo is something of a torch- passing. Founding members Emilio Castillo, Stephen Kupka and Dave Garibaldi are all still in the fold, but their 19th studio album finds both bassist Francis Prestia, who was part of the original lineup, and their vocalist Ray Greene, handing the reins to some younger guns. For most other bands, those lineup shake-ups would be small causes for alarm, but TOP has five decades’ worth of membership changes and it hasn’t slowed them down one bit, nor has it had a noticeable effect on their horn-heavy sound. Which is to say that new vocalist Marcus Scott has slipped into the role of frontman with ease, adding a shot of energy to the three songs that he sings lead on, while Greene settles comfortably into the fine-tuned grooves of each track on this double LP set. That goes double for the rest of _Step Up_. TOP are smart enough to not mess with the core sound that turned them into a consistently great touring act, even 50 years after they first tread the boards together in the late ‘60s.

"I can tell you his dad would certainly be proud."
 Twice Jason Mohns was named the AIA Division III's top coach (2013-14). He received the '15 National Football Foundation Arizona coach of the year honour and two years later was recognized as the Arizona Cardinals outstanding high school coach.
 Mohns was also a '17 finalist for the NFL's Don Shula National coaching award.
 But one of Mohns's proudest accomplishments was being named Saguaro's head coach in 2012 while his father was still alive.
 "Just him seeing me make that climb and get the opportunity to be the head coach at a top program, he was extremely proud of me," Mohns said. "I wish he could've been there with me on the sidelines for a game . . . but I've always known he's been with me.
 "I have no doubt he's had a role in all the success I've had and everything that's happened for me."
 Predictably, NCAA programs have taken notice but Mohns said he would take a special offer for him to contemplate leaving Arizona.
 "I've got a great situation here," he said. "A great job in a beautiful part of the country, I get to be a part of my kids' lives every day and my family and my wife's family are here.
 "The competitor in me, if the right thing comes along, I'd love to give it a shot but I'm not going to chase it. I'm not going to take the wrong job just to say I made it to that level. I think I've got a good perspective seeing my dad and his career."
 Mohns still keeps in touch with Rita, former CFL player-coach Joe Paopao and longtime scout Craig Smith. He's also developed relationships with Paopao's nephew, Jordan — a coach at UNLV — and former Hamilton quarterback Timm Rosenbach, now Montana's offensive co-ordinator.
 Mohns admits he has a lifetime's worth of CFL memories. Two favourites involve Toronto's '96 snowy Grey Cup win over Edmonton, and a recollection of former Argos quarterback Doug Flutie.
 "I was on the sidelines for the Snow Bowl and got to sip champagne from the Cup with my dad at the celebration afterwards," he said. "You never forget things like that.
 "I got to travel to a game that year in Winnipeg. The Argos won and afterwards dad and I were walking to grab a bite and Doug Flutie asked to join us. He tore it up that game, Toronto scored 40-something points, but all Doug talked about were the mistakes he made, the reads he missed. I never forgot that."
 Time has allowed Mohns to come to terms with his father's passing, in part thanks to one of his dad's most unique possessions.
 "Something dad did that was very cool was keep a helmet from every single team he was with, college and pro," Mohns said. "In my office, I have a wall that's lined in chronological order with helmets from his first job to his last.
 "College coaches come in all the time and ask, 'How do you have a B.C. Lions helmet,' or "How do you have a Memphis Mad Dogs helmet?' I talk about him all the time, I talk about him on a weekly basis and that's really helped me cope with not having him.
 "It's easier than it used to but every now and then it jumps up and bites you. It's never not tough but it gets easier when you talk about it."

LONDON: European stock markets extended gains Tuesday after a largely positive showing across Asia and as oil prices rebounded from 18-year lows, with a jump in Chinese factory activity providing a surprise boost for the virus-hit global economy.
 Around midday, Europe's main stock markets were up more than one% on average.
 The dollar was higher, while the euro came under pressure from data showing inflation in the eurozone fell in March on a slump in energy prices caused by the coronavirus outbreak.

The personnel listed on the back of Jon Hassell’s debut album only offers slight hints of what the novice listener might expect when dropping the needle on this reissue: percussionists Nana Vasconcelos and William Winant, synth pioneer David Rosenboom, guitarists Michael Brook and Larry Polansky (working in technical roles). But even knowing a bit of each artists’ work will only get you partway to what Hassell created on _Vernal Equinox_. It was the first flushes of his self-proclaimed “Fourth World” sound that blended musical ideas from Africa, Asia and South America and fed them into the welcome arms of new technology like early effects pedals and modular synths (the ARP, Buchla and Serge synthesizers all make appearances here), all led by Hassell’s heavily processed trumpet. The music on _Vernal_ floats between stations—shortwave broadcasts from around the globe battling for attention and creating juxtapositions that shouldn’t work yet somehow make perfect sense when combined like this. Hassell, with remastering assistance from Al Carlson and new lacquers cut by John Bonati, oversaw the re-release of this album, as part of his work to secure his bag and his legacy via his own label Ndeya, which should assure you as to the quality within. The strange allure of these spirituous compositions is still reaching out to fresh ears some 43 years after its original sessions. It’ll hook you if you let it.

"I played football when I was younger but I really got into hockey," Mohns said. "All through high school I played club hockey . . . so coaching football was never on my radar.
 "I played every sport growing up, I loved to compete and was blessed to be around some awesome teams with my dad. But football wasn't my first love and it was one of those things that kind of fell into my lap."
 While attending Arizona State University, Mohns worked with the city of Scottsdale and became involved in community youth sports programs, coaching girls basketball and flag football for grade 7-8 students. When many of those players went to play Pop Warner, Mohns followed as a volunteer coach.
 He founded the Scottsdale Argonauts youth club (for players aged eight to 14). In 2007, he was hired as the head coach of Saguaro's freshman team.
 "When they called me up out of the blue I told them I didn't think I was qualified to coach high school football at any level," Mohns said. "I'd only had fun coaching youth sports and was volunteering to coach Pop Warner and it wasn't anything I was trying to do as a career.
 "I ended up taking the job and kind of caught the coaching bug. All the experiences I had with my dad . . . there was definitely something inside of me and once I started doing it I fell in love with it."
 But at the expense of hockey.
 "My hockey bag just officially made the move up to the attic," Mohns said. "Our program is recognized nationally and it's a year-round deal and takes up a ton of my time.
 "When I have free time I try to devote it to my wife and two kids so it's hard. My buddies who I played with still play and they've been trying to get me into the old-guy leagues. I was really close but ice times are at 10-11 p.m. and I was like,' Guys, I can't do it.' I miss it like crazy . . . but I might officially be retired now."
 However hockey equipment still exists at the Mohns household.
 "We have hockey sticks throughout the house," he said. "My son is 16 months old and I'm teaching him how to handle a stick and we have the mini goal and nerf pucks set up."
 Greg Mohns spent the better part of two decades in the CFL. He served as a player-personnel director, assistant GM and head coach with Hamilton (1991-94), Memphis (1995), Toronto (1996, 2003-09) and B.C. (1998-2000).
 Mohns was also an NCAA coach and served as a scout and co-ordinator of pro scouting with the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs. He won two Grey Cups with Toronto ('96, '04) but died in 2012 at age 62 due to throat cancer.
 Adam Rita, the longtime CFL coach/GM who worked with Greg Mohns in Toronto, Memphis and B.C., isn't surprised the junior Mohns eventually landed in football.
 "I kind of had a suspicion when he named the team he organized in Arizona the Argonauts," Rita said. "I think it's no different than when your father is a carpenter and you follow in his footsteps . . . you gain an interest and expertise in something you feel comfortable with it and you move on with it.

Goodman's and Moynihan's attack piece in Saturday's paper is a joke. It labels the COVID - 19 scourge "The Trump pandemic" as though he was the cause. It criticizes his statements about the country being released from the COVID - 19 restrictions by Easter labeling them "lies and misstatements" rather than what they are -- hopeful remarks aiding the country to look on the bright side in a time of pervasive gloom. It closes misusing/abusing an interview with Sean Petty, an emergency nurse from the Bronx. who no doubt is hard working and dedicated. He referred to not having enough masks (first the hospital's responsibility, then the city's responsibility and then the state's responsibility) and Goodman and Moynihan linked that to Sean's misdirected statement, no doubt out of frustration, "that the Trump Administration and the federal authorities have done virtually nothing." Goodman and Moynahan are masters of the lie. This letter is not politically motivated. It is motivated out of disgust over lack of journalistic integrity.

"But to actually think that we've had to forget about football and start focusing on our health, to collectively fight against something, you just never imagined it would be in your lifetime."
 In typical Herdman fashion, he looks for the silver lining in the dark COVID-19 cloud currently above all of us.
 "I keep saying to the staff ... we've got to keep looking for the opportunities and there's been some real opportunities to dig in," he said.
 On the football front, that has included strategic planning, statistical analysis and tactical reviews as well as starting scouting possible World Cup qualifying opponents.
 With the world understandably preoccupied with the pandemic, there has been no word on whether the CONCACAF qualifying path has changed with the ongoing schedule disruptions.
 "Who knows? Everything is up in the air," said Herdman.
 The Canadian men, currently ranked 73rd in the world and seventh in CONCACAF, are chasing El Salvador (No. 69 in the world and sixth in CONCACAF) in a bid to move past the Central Americans in the ratings. That's because the top six CONCACAF teams after the June international window will advance to the so- called Hex, the most direct route of World Cup qualifying out of the region.
 The top three teams in the Hex will book their ticket to Qatar 2022.
 Teams ranked seventh through 35th in CONCACAF, which covers North and Central America and the Caribbean, face a more convoluted route. The last team standing will face the fourth-place finisher in the Hex to determine the CONCACAF representative in an intercontinental playoff.
 Canada planned March 27 and 31 games against No. 105 Trinidad in a bid to gain needed ranking points and close the 14-point gap on El Salvador. With the March matches cancelled and the June international window possibly coming and going without competition, Canada Soccer awaits word on what's next.
 "We haven't been officially informed of anything yet," said Herdman. "And I think everyone is just giving each other the grace to focus probably on themselves and their families and then to look at some of the bigger impacts that the virus is having on the game.
 "So I think those decisions will be made by FIFA and CONCACAF and at the right time will be passed down the line to us. But we'll be ready. That's the catchcry internally."
 Herdman expects a congested schedule when soccer returns, so being prepared is key given time may be short.

Again, it’s an evolving thing. The goal here is to get through this. And you just don’t know. There was just a paper in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ that says that the virus, albeit at lower numbers, can survive on stainless steel and plastic for three days, and on cardboard it goes away within 24 hours, which probably means that on paper it also does. So initially, I had been going out with normal hands, just getting the mail and taking it inside. Then, I was sanitizing my hands and wiping off the mail and getting rid of [the junk mail] in a trash can right at the mailbox. Now, I actually get the mail with gloves on, discard 90 percent of it [in the trash can], and then open [the remaining 10 percent] with the gloves on. And if I want to keep something, then I bring it in the house and wipe it off. And I’ve been putting [the mail I do want to keep] aside so you don’t even have to look at it or touch it for a day or so. So it’s actually segregating it. I get that this is really perhaps going overboard, but what’s the big deal? It doesn’t cost me a damned thing to do it.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — A large haul of drugs, including opioids, methamphetamine and cocaine, being smuggled from Mexico to California was seized from a cross-border tunnel equipped with ventilation, lighting and an underground rail system, authorities said Tuesday.The tunnel connected warehouses in Tijuana and San Diego, extending about 2,000 feet (610 meters) with an average depth of 31 feet (9.5 meters) and width of 3 feet (0.9 meter), according to the San Diego Tunnel Task Force, an investigative team made up of several federal agencies. Investigators believe the tunnel existed for several months “due to the advanced construction observed in several portions.”This photo released Tuesday, March 31 2020, by the San Diego Tunnel Task Force, Department of Homeland Security, shows a rail system in a cross-border tunnel running from warehouses in Tijuana, Mexico to San Diego. U.S. authorities seized a large haul of drugs including opioids, methamphetamine and cocaine, being smuggled through the tunnel equipped with ventilation, lighting and an underground rail system. Authorities believe it existed for several months.Authorities seized more than two tons of a variety of drugs, a departure from earlier discoveries that consisted largely of marijuana. The discovery of the tunnel on March 19 netted about 1,300 pounds (590 kilograms) of cocaine, 86 pounds (39 kilograms) of methamphetamine, 17 pounds (7.7 kilograms) of heroin, 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms) of marijuana and more than two pounds (0.9 kilogram) of fentanyl.The tunnel was built near a vaunted double-layered border wall constructed under President Donald Trump's watch, illustrating the limitations of such barriers against sophisticated drug smuggling organizations. While border walls built under Trump go underground to deter digging, they are not nearly deep enough to stop the most advanced secret passageways.The discovery marked the first time that five types of drugs were found in a single tunnel in San Diego, a magnet for Mexican cartels for its clay-like soil and abundance of industrial warehouses on both sides of the border that give cover for trucks and heavy construction equipment.No arrests were made but authorities said the investigation was open.Opioid smuggling has grown in line with demand in the U.S. and has traditionally been done in cars and by people through official crossings with Mexico because it is easier to conceal and less odorous than marijuana. Authorities said the latest tunnel is more a reflection of overall drug demand in the U.S. than a strategic shift in smuggling methods.“There's no rhyme or reason to it,” said Lauren Mack, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit. “They make their decisions based on contacts or where they think they're more likely to get the drugs through.”U.S. authorities said they alerted Mexican counterparts about their investigation for help locating the entry point in Tijuana and later executed a search warrant in San Diego's Otay Mesa industrial warehouse district.In January, authorities announced the discovery of the longest smuggling tunnel ever found on the U.S.-Mexico border, stretching more than three-quarters of a mile from a small industrial building in Tijuana into San Diego. The nearby tunnel had an extensive rail-cart system, forced air ventilation, high voltage electrical cables and panels, an elevator at the tunnel entrance, and a complex drainage system.There were no arrests, drug seizures or confirmed exit point in the United States in that discovery. But the length — more than 14 football fields — stunned authorities. It went under several warehouses in San Diego.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

 United are keen on Sancho, but the fee remains a significant barrier to any deal. Reports suggest that Dortmund have indicated they will stick to their guns on that massive asking price, even though the market has clearly changed, because of the Coronavirus crisis.

YORK, Maine -- Town officials are set to decide this week whether to impose a "stay-at-home" order to help curb the coronavirus pandemic, which has sickened dozens of locals with COVID-19, including one person who died.
   
 York Health Officer Amber Harrison confirmed the death Monday night during a Board of Selectmen meeting and said there are roughly two dozen people in town who have tested positive for the virus.
   
 The virus has been spreading in York County, where there were 59 confirmed cases, as of Tuesday morning, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the state's 303 cases are in Cumberland County, where there were 169 cases.
   
 The patient who died in York was a local woman in her 80s, Maine CDC Dr. Nirav Shah said during a press conference Tuesday, when he announced Maine's COVID-19 death toll had climbed to five statewide. Citing privacy considerations, Shah declined to share additional information about the circumstances of the local death, which was York County's first.
   
 York Hospital spokesperson Jody Merrill confirmed Tuesday that the death occurred at the hospital.
   
 The somber news came during Monday's Board of Selectmen meeting as town leaders discussed the possibility of issuing an emergency proclamation with an order to stay home.
   
 Board Chair Todd Frederick said there's no mistaking the fact the pandemic has arrived in York. "It's here in our town, and it's here in a bad way," he said.
   
 Board member Robert Palmer Jr. said he and his fellow selectmen ought to act carefully. Palmer and others noted their concerns with the way some municipalities, including Portland, had worded and imposed their own stay-at- home orders amid the pandemic. But selectmen also should act with urgency, he said.
   
 "If we wait two weeks, it's going to be too late." Palmer said.
   
 With a series of unanimous votes, the board directed Harrison to work with Police Chief Charles Szeniawski to prepare a draft order for selectmen to consider at an emergency meeting at 7 p.m. this Thursday. The order would outline what activities people in York would be prohibited from doing while the proposed stay-at-home order is in effect, as well as what essential activities will be allowed.
   
 Town Manager Steve Burns said he has been working with his counterparts in surrounding communities and urging the state government to lead with a stronger hand. Burns suggested Gov. Janet Mills could impose stay-at-home orders on a county-by-county basis.
   
 "It doesn't have to be a one-size-fits-all approach -- we even think a regional or county approach could work so long as each town is under the same expectations," Burns said late last week, when York extended the closure of its non-essential offices until April 18.
   
 In light of their concerns over the state government's hesitance to issue a blanket order, selectmen directed Burns, with help from Szeniawski and Harrison, to let surrounding communities know what York is preparing to do so others might join the effort.
   
 They likened the effort to York's decision early last week to close beaches to reduce crowds of people, through which the virus can spread quickly. By the end of the week, beaches were closed in Ogunquit, Wells, Kennebunk and Kittery.
   
 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.
   
 Nationwide, the public is advised to adhere to physical distancing guidelines, which include avoiding crowds, staying 6 feet away from others, not shaking hands or hugging, and using phones or other media to chat with friends and loved ones rather than meeting face to face.
   
 People can protect their health by taking the same preventive measures that help to avoid catching a cold, officials said: Wash your hands often for 20 seconds, cover coughs and sneezes, and stay home if you are sick.
   
 COVID-19 symptoms include fever, shortness of breath and lower respiratory distress. Individuals who exhibit those symptoms are advised to contact medical providers before going to a health care facility. Medical providers will make initial determinations about who should be tested.
   
 Need help?
   
 Anyone who may be in crisis and needs help is encouraged to call the Maine Statewide Crisis Hotline at (888) 568-1112.
   
 Anyone with general questions about COVID-19 can call 211, or (866) 811-5695, text their zip code to 898-211, or email info@211maine.org. Calls, texts and emails are answered every day around the clock by someone within the state, according to the Maine CDC.
   
 Anyone looking for specific medical advice regarding symptoms they may be experiencing is urged to call their medical provider, an urgent care center or 911, depending on the severity of their symptoms. COVID-19 symptoms include fever, shortness of breath and lower respiratory distress.
