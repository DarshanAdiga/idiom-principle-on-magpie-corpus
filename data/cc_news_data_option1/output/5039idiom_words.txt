 This morning will go down in history, not just as the day that marked the beginning of the end of this pandemic but also as a milestone in science. To have condensed all the research and development of a vaccine for a completely new virus into ten months, have it work, get it approved, manufactured and into arms is a feat unknown before.
 It is an unprecedented moment few will forget and will be written about for years to come.

 150 vaccinations will be done at this hospital today and 400 a day by next week. Once they scale up in the New Year they hope to have a tent in the car park, similar to testing sites we’ve seen throughout the pandemic. Let’s hope that is the case, since the Pfizer jab is so tricky to store that is a big ask.
