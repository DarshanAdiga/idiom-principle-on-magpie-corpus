 "I assume those things will come up if cases are still happening closer to the date, then we'll touch base with Cricket Australia and have a chat," Hazlewood added.
 Meanwhile, the Tamworth-born pacer is not expecting a starting place in Australia's T20I side against England but retains the ambition to be a three- format player at the international level.

TUCSON, Ariz. - Combat rescue crews from Davis-Monthan are prepared to fly into danger---even enemy fire---to get people to safety, but they just came back from a long, unusual mission that took them from the desert---to hundreds of miles over the ocean.
 Several units pulled together to pull off a challenging long range rescue. A Chinese cargo ship called for help when a crewman fell about 30 feet and broke multiple bones. The California Air National Guard flew an HC-130 fixed wing more than 1,300 miles over the Pacific. Pararescue jumpers from the 129th Rescue Wing parachuted into the sea, boarded the ship and stabilized the crewman.
 Two helicopters from Davis-Monthan’s 563rd Rescue Group flew to Moffitt Field in California then headed offshore at daybreak keeping a close eye on fuel as they flew more than 400 miles to find the ship.
 The ship had no landing pad, so they needed to spend about an hour carefully hovering and hoisting the injured sailor and five pararescue jumpers into the helicopter from a small side deck.
 Captain Mark Ross says, “So that made it pretty challenging for not only the pilots, you have to keep references on the ship, but as well as our special mission aviators who have to very precisely lower and raise the devices to that deck in order to keep everybody safe in the survivors on and off the aircraft, and to the ship.”
 Staff Sergeant Michael Conley worked long hours to keep the helicopters’ satellite communications able to finish the mission.
 “It doesn't matter how many hours we work. It's all about getting that save getting, you know, saving anybody's life really. It doesn't have to be anyone's in particular, and we're just there to get the mission done and we’re ready to do it at any given moment.”
 The helicopters had to use mid-air refueling four times to be able to fly an eight hour mission.
 Finally, they landed back in California and the injured sailor was on his way to hospital care.

O Orçamento de 2021 entregue ao Congresso nao traz margem de manobra e ainda calcula uma despesa aquem daquela que o governo realmente tera. Primeiro, o Renda Brasil, discutido pelo presidente Jair Bolsonaro, ministros e lideres partidarios, nao foi previsto. Para completar, a despesa previdenciaria, alerta o comandante da Instituiçao Fiscal Independente (Ifi), Felipe Salto, esta inferior ao que foi projetado, por exemplo, na Ifi. Em relaçao ao teto de gastos, nao ha folga, "o que deixa o governo numa armadilha de ter de cortar despesa em caso de gasto adicional", alerta Salto.   Diante da dificuldade, Salto nao ve saida para o Poder Executivo que nao seja resolver logo o impasse do teto de gastos. Pode ser, inclusive, algo semelhante ao que foi adotado em 2018 em relaçao a regra de ouro (nao poder gerar divida para pagamento de despesas correntes). Foi possivel gerar divida para as despesas correntes, desde que mediante aprovaçao do Congresso. O que nao da, diz o proprio Salto em artigo publicado em O Estado de S. Paulo, e discutir o Renda Brasil distante dos numeros. "Se prevalecer a tese de que nao e preciso aumentar receita e/ou cortar despesa para custear o aumento de novas despesas, tera vencido o populismo fiscal. É preciso barrar essa ameaça".

The war - Moore’s second - brought out a common touch in an artist so far known to be difficult. His Shelter Drawings rival that renowned photograph of St Paul’s ringed with fires in shaping our folk memory of the Blitz. Moore also went north, to draw miners at the coalface beneath his native Castleford. In 1943 he began work on his most amiable public sculpture, the Madonna and Child group in St. Matthew’s, Northampton. This was followed by family groups in bronze, some of which ended up in the New Towns.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A plan by the governor of Oregon to use sheriff’s deputies from surrounding counties to help patrol Portland following the deadly shooting of a right-wing Trump supporter was sharply criticized by law enforcement officials who said it wouldn't end the “cycle of violence” in the city that’s approaching 100 consecutive nights of often-violent Black Lives Matter protests.

I would like to note that the process of documenting a drug group (as a rule, there are very few single drug dealers, the drug dealers are working in whole groups) is complex, laborious and requires collection of the most complete evidence base.

Unite Norman submitted signatures to recall Clark, Petrone and Wilson, now resigned. City Clerk Brenda Hall has said she will finish verifying signatures no later than Sept 14. If enough signatures are valid, the council will set a recall election according to the City Charter and the Cleveland County Election Board schedule.
 FINDING THE FIRM
 Bierman told The Transcript last week that councilors hired Crowe & Dunlevy, a firm that specializes in petitions, but she learned there was a conflict of interest.
 “Our attorneys at Crowe & Dunlevy had done their initial conflict-of-interest check before they took on the case,” she said. “What they did not do was check their own backyard. They discovered one of their attorneys had circulated, who lives in Norman, had actually circulated the petition.”
 When contacted on Monday, Melanie Rughani of Crowe & Dunlevy said the firm had no comment.
 “Unfortunately, it is our policy not to comment on such matters,” Rughani said. “Thanks so much for reaching out.”
 Beirman said she and Petrone will consult with the Norman Wohlgemuth Group Tuesday in Tulsa. Petrone has fully recovered from COVID-19, she said Monday.
 A focus of the challenge is that the charter does not require an affidavit for signatures, Bierman said. Unlike requirements for state initiative petitions, the charter does not require a notarized signature from a recall petition gatherer or designated person swearing the signatures were authentic and obtained legally.
 Councilors find the inconsistency troubling. While Bierman was hesitant to be more specific about further legal challenges to the recall signature process without the input of legal counsel, she alleged Unite Norman’s petitions did not meet certain requirements.
 “From what we know now, the petitions certainly don’t meet the requirement in the charter, but they also don’t meet the requirements of state law,” she said. “All Norman residents deserve due process when it comes to whatever kind of petition is being circulated in this community.”
 Bierman also said the legal challenge could mean a charter amendment would be proposed to voters but was not optimistic it would be in time for an election this year, she said.
 Co-Chair of Unite Norman Russell Smith said his group “followed the charter to the letter” and that any proposed amendments would “not apply retroactively.”

CENTERVILLE -- A local company has won $25,000 for its innovative face mask design.
 "I couldn't believe we won, I was over the moon," said Bethany Salvon, owner of Speakeasy Travel Supply in Centerville, about winning the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative's inaugural COVID-19 Intrapreneur Challenge last month.
 The Intrapreneur Challenge is a competition focused on companies pivoting operations to produce general-use face masks. It featured competition among 11 established Bay State companies pitching their designs and business plans focused on addressing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
 Speakeasy, founded in 2013 by Salvon, a professional photographer and former travel blogger, sells a wide variety of travel scarves. The company's signature scarves have hidden pockets and self-locking zippers that allow wearers to securely hold and disguise items such as passports, cellphones, keys, money and maps.
 "Necessity is the mother of invention," said world traveler Salvon, 44, about creating the market's first travel scarf.
 "I needed my phone with me and women's travel clothing does not have a lot of pockets, but I always had a lot of scarves," she said. "So I went home and made one (travel scarf) and it worked."
 Soon after, Salvin had a sewing machine, customers and a thriving company.
 But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in the spring, travel and the travel industry were deeply affected.
 "We needed to pivot really quickly and started making cotton face masks in March," Salvon said.
 The masks initially were for donation only, she said, but eventually were offered for sale to sustain the ongoing donation program.
 Salvon said Speakeasy initially landed on the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative's radar when it was launching a similar competition, but it was for personal protective equipment and not applicable for the company.
 "But our name stayed on their list, and in June the competition expanded to face masks and we were invited to apply," Salvon said.
 The challenge of the competition, managed by Lever, a North Adams-based business accelerator and innovation support organization, was to make a better face mask. Lever worked with participants on market positioning, developing a solid business plan and creating go-to-market strategies. They were also given access to manufacturing experts and potential face mask customers.
 The winning Speakeasy entry, awarded by a panel of expert judges, was a two- sided, fully adjustable mask with no ear loops that can be worn like a scarf and pulled up when needed to cover the mouth and nose. It features a built-in nose bridge, which is removable, and a pocket for a filter.
 Unlike a tight-fitting neck gaiter, the Speakeasy invention is adjustable and elastic, and features all of the safety and security of a face mask.
 "It feels nice," Savlon said.
 Savlon said the $25,000 award will be used for supplies, marketing and other business operations. She expects the new product to be available later this month at an approximate $25 to $30 price point.

Sign of the times: New Collinwood mural reflects modern-day community hope

Images of packed beaches, lakes and bars have made the rounds on traditional and social media for much of the summer, drawing scorn from those concerned about the coronavirus spreading among those crowds.
 Less prominent but also troubling are the growing instances of case clusters arising from smaller gatherings.
 Contact tracing yields information about the sources of infections as the USA, by far the world leader in total COVID-19 cases and deaths, grapples with how to keep its population safe while propping up a flagging economy. More than 182,000 Americans have been killed by the disease.
 The hasty reopening of businesses across much of the nation after the spring shutdown was largely blamed for a summer surge in infections, but social functions of various sizes among relatives, friends and co-workers may have been a contributing factor as well.
 Public health experts sound the alarm as the Labor Day weekend approaches.
 "People don't think of it in the same way as the (President) Trump rally in Tulsa, a bunch of people on the beach or in the bars, but these small events add up to a lot. It's just invisible," said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco who specializes in infectious diseases.
 There's no generally accepted definition of what's a small gathering - it may range from five to 30 people - and the majority of these activities take place behind closed doors. That makes it difficult to garner hard data about them.
 In late July, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said contact tracing revealed 44% of those testing positive for the virus in the state reported attending a family activity and 23% a house party, but the size of the events was not specified.
 Plenty of anecdotal evidence supports the notion that getting together with people outside the immediate household, even in fairly limited numbers, can lead to a rash of infections. Chin-Hong said several of the COVID-19 patients he treated believe they caught the virus at barbecues.
 Weddings have been more troublesome, including a 100-guest event in San Francisco in early July that resulted in at least 10 people contracting the virus, among them the bride and groom.
 Smaller events, such as family, office and graduation parties, have yielded COVID-19 cases as well.
 In Alabama, eight of 11 relatives who went to a lake house together in July tested positive for the coronavirus.
 In the Washington, D.C., area, the host of a backyard dinner in June for about 25 came down with COVID-19, as did some of her guests.
 And in Houston, seven members of a family that went out for a Fathers' Day meal developed COVID-19.
 "Small gatherings are a concern because there's so many of them. They may account for a much greater proportion of the cases than we think right now,'' said Dr. George Rutherford, a colleague of Chin-Hong's at UCSF and the principal investigator for California's contact tracing program.
 Rutherford emphasized the need for those planning to attend or host functions on Labor Day weekend to practice social distancing and wear masks as much as possible, but he's even more wary of what may be in store after Thanksgiving.
 Extended families traditionally convene on that holiday, often after traveling from far away, and sit around for long stretches, be it eating or watching NFL games on TV. The dinners are almost always held indoors, where limited ventilation makes it easier to contract the virus.
 "Everybody's going to be there with their belts undone and the top button off their pants, snoring and laying without masks on watching football in some tiny little den," Rutherford said. "It's not a pretty picture. There could be a lot of transmission. And Christmas is going to be exactly the same. It's unfortunate, but this is not the year for family gatherings."
 Given human nature, it's nearly impossible to prevent them.
 Matt Lambert, an emergency room physician based in Washington, D.C., said he would advise against any gatherings bigger than 25 people, small enough for the hosts to inquire about symptoms before the event.
 Those seeking to congregate for special occasions could take extreme measures, like a couple Lambert heard of who held their wedding at a zoo, where the staff enforced distancing regulations.
 Even then, it's hard to keep people apart.
 "We're not made that way," Lambert said. "You get extended loved ones together, especially at a wedding, and there's going to be some hugging going on."
 Lambert said he has treated patients who contracted the virus at a dinner with only eight participants, although he noted the party was held indoors and guests sat close to each other.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization posted guidelines for gatherings, and Chin-Hong said relatively safe barbecues can be held if the hosts and guests take precautions.
 He pointed out that, besides mask usage, the main determinants of risk when people assemble are the size of the group, the type and duration of the activity, where it's held (indoors or outdoors), whether alcohol is served, whether there is shouting or singing and how well participants know each other.
 Chin-Hong suggested inviting no more than two or three groups, each from a single household, and having them stay in their own "pods," at least 6 feet apart from the other participants. The event should be outdoors, hand sanitizer should be readily available, and either a host wearing a mask should serve the food, or the members of each pod could serve themselves while maintaining distance from the rest. Anybody using the bathroom should wear a mask.
 "It's fine to have a barbecue if you do it in a modest way and think about these risk aspects of keeping the pods apart from each other," Chin-Hong said. "I'm not against barbecues at all, but you can make it safer by not having a big event. Don't try to have a class reunion barbecue right now."

Thanks to a $700,000 grant from the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Graham County communities will soon have a plan in place to address potential flooding.
 Pima, Thatcher, Safford and the county all have areas that are flood prone.
 Several Thatcher residences were flooded in 2018 when a First Avenue irrigation canal broke during a massive rain storm. One woman was trapped inside her home in Quail Ridge when flood waters pressed her doors shut and first responders had to come to her rescue.
 The Town of Pima spends nearly $40,000 every year to remove loads of silt from canals — the result of the 2017 Frye Fire on Mount Graham. The fire destroyed the foliage that would normally keep it from running down the mountain when it rains.
 The silt and sand builds up in the canals and the Town of Pima empties it by the semi load, but it continues to build up, which can result in water overflowing the banks, said Pima Town Manager Sean Lewis.
 “We’ve been having to maintain it and we’re basically spinning our wheels. We’ll have 50 to 60 semi loads of sand removed, and in one rain storm it’s all back,” Lewis said.
 In Thatcher, irrigation canals sometimes break because they weren’t built to deal with excess water that accumulates during heavy rains, said Michael Bryce, Graham County engineer.
 Graham County, the City of Safford and the towns of Pima and Thatcher worked together on the grant application and it was awarded in early August.
 “This is a multi-phase and multi-year project, this first phase is an assessment that will lead to specific designs of areas that will then lead to the actual construction of drainage and flood control facilities,” said Graham County Manager Dustin Welker.
 All of the areas waterways and flood plains will be assessed. Once completed, those involved with the Gila Valley Flood Protection and Watershed Improvement Project will apply for additional grant funding for actual construction projects based on the assessment.
 “The great thing about this project is all four communities, Graham County, Safford, Thatcher and Pima, are working together and taking a county-wide approach to the solution. Each of our organizations has very talented and knowledgeable engineers and they will be taking the lead on this project,” Welker said.
 County officials were thrilled to get the grant.
 “Now we have the funds to look closer at the issue,” Bryce said. “It could end up being multiple projects. The main importance is that our citizens’ property is better protected from possible flooding damage.”
 Bryce estimated the assessment will take up to 18 months to complete.
 Lewis said he hopes a dam near Pima will end up on the list of needed improvements, but nobody knows what a new waterways and flood mitigation plan will look like.
 However, one thing is clear, if the Town of Pima has fewer flood plains, property values will increase, he said.
 City of Safford Public Works Director Lance Henrie said hopes to see a gate on the Highline Canal. Such a gate would send heavy rain water directly into the Gila River bed instead of overflowing farming canals and flooding homes.
 “This is going to be a nice study of the overall valley, pinpointing potential projects that can help us out for the whole valley,” Henrie said. “I think it’s a great project and it will be a good project to base their future capital projects off of and possibly be funded by the NRCS.”
 As for Thatcher, there are flood plains near Dailey Estates, but the town has other issues as well, said Town Manager Heath Brown.
 “One of our biggest problems is a lot of the street water and flood water makes its way into the canals and then they get full and in big storms they overflow and go right into houses and businesses,” said Brown. “Eventually we want to come up for outlets for the canals so we can get water to drain out of the canals straight down to the river to stop those canals from overflowing.”
 Thatcher has also eyed adding town-owned retention basins.
 The water run-off from Mount Graham causes sand and silt to build up in Thatcher’s dam. Several years ago another grant allowed the town to dredge the dam, but the continuous flow of sand and silt from the mountain continues, Brown said.
 “I love that we’re doing this collectively as a county,” said Brown. “I think it’s a great collective project.”
