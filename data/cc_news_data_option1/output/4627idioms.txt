A quick look at how much time, money, and stress this could save us – 1/5th of doctor’s consultation time is spent on non-medical issues and there are more than 13.5 million GP appointments that do not require medical attention, most of these can be attributed to the human nature of worrying and because there is no other way of ruling out how we feel. Devices like Kala that use existing technology in innovative ways can pave the way to make monitoring devices digital, smaller, non-invasive, and most importantly, accessible. Over 60% of the world’s deaths are caused by heart disease, stroke, cancer, respiratory disease, and diabetes. The first step in diagnosing these ailments requires simple tools like a stethoscope, thermometer, blood pressure pump, and self- glucose monitor – Kala includes all of these and more. It tests lung functions, temperature, blood glucose, blood oxygen, stethoscope, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure which can reduce panic doctor visits and save time on follow-ups too.

ECU senior quarterback Holton Ahlers has passed for 1,354 yards and 12 touchdowns. The Bearcats also are wary of sophomore receiver C.J. Johnson, who has 13 catches for 286 yards and a team-leading four touchdowns this season. In last year's meeting, a 46-43 Bearcats victory, Johnson had 12 catches for 283 yards and a TD.
 Cincinnati has outscored opponents 236 to 70 this season.
 “When you look at their roster, the same guys have been playing for multiple years," ECU coach Mike Houston said. “They are seniors backed up by juniors across the two deep. We played well against them offensively last year. Obviously, having to travel up there and playing on the road will be tough.”
 Cincinnati senior running back Gerrid Doaks rushed for a career-high 184 yards in last week's win over Houston. Junior quarterback Desmond Ridder has accounted for 13 touchdowns in the past three games, including eight rushing TDs.
 “They have a lot of quarterback design stuff with reads off the backside of the run," Houston said. “With the way (Ridder) runs, you have to account for him. It’s something that will be a challenge this week.”
 The Bearcats also are getting healthy, with receiver Alec Pierce and cornerback Arquon Bush set to return. They also are motivated after dropping one spot in the AP Top 25 rankings this week despite the 38-10 win over Houston.
 “I want us to be greedy. Greedy to want more," Fickell said. "It creates a little chip on our shoulder. You try to find things that can keep you on edge, keep you motivated. I want us to stay humble, hungry and focused as much as we possibly can.”

“Why would we pack it in?" receiver Allen Robinson said. "We’re sitting second in our division, seven games left. There’s no need to panic and pack it in at all. At the end of the day, we know the kind of players that we have on this offense.”
 The past three games have been particularly tough for Chicago.
 The Bears got dominated in a Monday night loss to the Rams in Los Angeles, then lost in overtime to New Orleans at Soldier Field. At Tennessee last week, the Bears didn't score until the fourth quarter, and two late touchdowns made a 24-17 loss look closer than it really was.
 The Vikings, meanwhile, got tripped up in a 1-5 start that included one-point losses to Tennessee and Seattle. But wins over Green Bay and Detroit following a bye have them in contention.
 They can thank Dalvin Cook. The NFL's rushing leader has 478 yards and six TDs from scrimmage over the past two weeks.
 “Part of it is sticking to it and believing you can get some wins,” coach Mike Zimmer said. "I talked to them, I guess a few weeks ago: ‘Just believe.’ You’ve got to believe that you’re going to pull these games out, the ones we didn’t win early.”
 TIME TO GET GOING
 Cook has just 86 yards on 34 carries in three career games against the Bears. Quarterback Kirk Cousins, since joining the Vikings in 2018, is 0-3 with just three touchdown passes, two interceptions and one lost fumble against the Bears with an average of 5.5 yards per attempt. The onus will be on Cousins and Cook along with offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak and an improving offensive line to buck this recent trend of struggles against the sturdy Chicago defense.

If a town can be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable, Bend may be judged harshly for the death of David Melvin Savory on a cold night on the street.
 Indifference, delays, Not In My Backyard and lack of money lets homeless people die. Savory, a double leg amputee, died overnight outside a business on East Third Street. He was found Tuesday morning.
 Temperatures have routinely dipped below freezing in recent weeks. Bend's emergency warming shelter still is not open. Why does a warming shelter in Bend not have a permanent location? Why must there be a scramble to find one?
 Savory, 57, was on the waitlist for several homeless shelters. No room. Good Samaritans gave him blankets and food. They tried to find him a hotel. Hotels apparently would not take him in because he had no valid ID. Can't we do better as a community than that?
 The city of Bend has proposed a temporary camping area at Juniper Ridge. It wants a permanent winter warming shelter. The goal is to couple a shelter with a navigation center to help connect homeless with services. Those changes won't get everyone off the street. They won't solve every problem with addiction or mental illness. They might not have helped Savory. They could and would help some.
 The camp proposal faces resistance and concern from people who live near Juniper Ridge. They have reasons to be worried. The Juniper Ridge Fire in August was one. There's garbage, uncertainty and more. What is the city going to earn the trust of residents near the proposed camp? And if such a camp is not going to be at Juniper Ridge, where is it going to be? Somewhere else is not an answer.
 Helping the homeless requires money. The city needs a source of funding if it is going to make a difference. One proposal is to add an additional fee on development. If that isn't the answer, what is it going to be? Where is the money coming from?
 There are many organizations, agencies and individuals in Bend and the county who already try to help the homeless. You could make a difference. Learn about what they do. Learn about the gaps. Volunteer. A good place to start is to check out the information on the Homeless Leadership Coalition website, cohomeless.org.
 Colleen Thomas, the Homeless Services Coordinator at Deschutes County Behavioral Health, told us the answers are not just about warm coats and donations. It's the long-term solutions that matter. Do we care enough in Bend to do more?

 # Appeals court clears Harvard of racial bias in admissions
 Collin Binkley
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Boston_ – Harvard does not discriminate against Asian American applicants, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday in a decision that offers relief to other colleges that consider race in admissions, but also sets the stage for a potential review by an increasingly conservative U.S. Supreme Court.
 The decision came from two judges on the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston who rejected claims from an anti-affirmative action group that accused the Ivy League University of imposing a “racial penalty” on Asian Americans. The judges upheld a previous ruling clearing Harvard of discrimination when choosing students.
 It delivers a blow to the suit’s plaintiff, Students for Fair Admissions, a nonprofit that aims to eliminate the use of race in college admissions. In a statement, the group’s president, Edward Blum, said he was disappointed but that “our hope is not lost.”
 “This lawsuit is now on track to go up to the U.S. Supreme Court where we will ask the justices to end these unfair and unconstitutional race-based admissions policies at Harvard and all colleges and universities,” Blum said.
 Both sides have been preparing for a possible review by the Supreme Court, and some legal scholars say the issue is ripe to be revisited.
 Filed in 2014, the lawsuit has revived a national debate about race’s role in college admissions. In multiple decisions spanning decades, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that colleges can consider race as a limited factor in order to promote campus diversity. But the practice faces mounting challenges in the courts, including three suits from Students from Fair Admissions.
 Many elite colleges consider applicants’ race and give an edge to some underrepresented students to promote diversity on campus. The Trump administration has opposed the practice and backed the lawsuit against Harvard. In October, the Justice Department filed a similar suit accusing Yale University of discriminating against Asian American and white applicants.
 In Thursday’s decision, however, the judges ruled that Harvard’s admissions process passes legal muster and aligns with requirements that the Supreme Court laid out in previous cases.
 “The issue before us is whether Harvard’s limited use of race in its admissions process in order to achieve diversity in the period in question is consistent with the requirements of Supreme Court precedent. There was no error,” the judges wrote.
 Blum, a legal strategist, has spent years working to rid racial considerations from college admissions. Before the Harvard case, he orchestrated an unsuccessful fight challenging the use of race at the University of Texas. In that case, a white student said she was rejected by the university because she was white.
 Several Asian American groups filed legal briefs supporting Harvard, while some others filed briefs backing the suit and alleging discrimination in Ivy League admissions.
 The suit alleges that Harvard’s admissions officers use a subjective “personal rating” to discriminate against Asian Americans who apply to the school. Using six years of admissions data, the group found that Asian American applicants were given the highest scores in an academic category but received the lowest scores on the personal rating.
 The group’s analysis found that Harvard accepted Asian Americans at lower rates than any other racial group, while giving preference to Black and Hispanic students with lower grades. The lawsuit also alleged that Harvard works to keep a consistent racial breakdown among new students, which the organization says amounts to illegal “racial balancing.”
 Harvard denies any discrimination and says it considers applicants’ race only in the narrow way approved by the U.S. Supreme Court. In close calls between students, some underrepresented students may get a “tip” in their favor, school officials have said, but students’ race is never counted against them.
 After a three-week trial that cast new light on Harvard’s secretive selection process, a federal judge ruled that other factors could explain why Asian Americans are admitted at lower rates than other students. In her 2019 ruling, District Judge Allison D. Burroughs said Harvard’s admissions process is “not perfect” but concluded that there was “no evidence of any racial animus whatsoever.”
 A three-judge panel of the appeals court heard arguments in September, but one of the judges, Juan Torruella, died in October before the case was decided. The ruling notes that Torruella heard oral arguments but did not participate in issuing the decision.
 The judges agreed with a district court finding that Harvard’s personal rating is not influenced by race. Although the rating may be correlated with race, the judges wrote, the link is more likely to be caused by outside factors including students’ personal essays or letters of recommendation.
 Ultimately, the judges wrote, Asian American identity has a statistically insignificant effect on admissions probability, and they concluded that Harvard does not place outsized emphasis on race.
 “Harvard has demonstrated that it values all types of diversity, not just racial diversity,” the judges wrote. “Harvard’s use of race in admissions is contextual and it does not consider race exclusively.”
 The decision received praise from the American Council on Education, an association of university presidents, which called it a “clear win” for Harvard and other universities.
 Some legal scholars, however, believe that the current makeup of the Supreme Court may be more likely to place tighter limits around the use of race in admissions or to forbid the practice entirely.
 The three Supreme Court justices appointed to the court by President Donald Trump have pushed the nation’s highest court more conservative than when it last ruled in favor of the consideration of race in college admissions in 2016.
 Along with the Harvard case, the Virginia-based Students for Fair Admissions is also suing to rid racial considerations at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and a separate case at the University of Texas at Austin.

 # Justice Dept.: ‘Poor judgment’ used in Epstein plea deal
 Michael Balsamo and Eric Tucker
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Washington_ – A Justice Department report has found former Labor Secretary Alex Acosta exercised “poor judgment” in handling an investigation into wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein when he was a top federal prosecutor in Florida.
 The report, obtained by The Associated Press, is a culmination of an investigation by the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility over Acosta’s handling of a secret plea deal with Epstein, who had been accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls.
 Under the 2008 non-prosecution agreement – also known as an NPA – Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. That allowed him to avert a possible life sentence, instead serving 13 months in a work-release program. He was required to make payments to victims and register as a sex offender.
 The investigation centered on two aspects of the Epstein case – whether prosecutors erred or committed misconduct by resolving the allegations through a non-prosecution agreement, and also whether they mishandled interactions with victims in the case.
 The report concludes that none of the attorneys committed misconduct in their interactions with the victims because there was no “clear and unambiguous duty” to consult with victims before entering into the non-prosecution agreement.
 Epstein was later charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan for nearly identical allegations in 2019, but he took his own life while in federal custody as he awaited trial.
 The Justice Department’s internal probe concluded that Acosta’s “decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA constitutes poor judgment.”
 Investigators found that although it was within his broad discretion and did not result from “improper favors,” the agreement was “a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its investigation of Epstein.”
 The investigation included interviews with more than 60 witnesses and a review of hundreds of thousands of Justice Department records. Officials from the Office of Professional Responsibility identified as subjects of the investigation Acosta, three former supervisors in his prosecuting office as well as an assistant United States attorney involved in the Epstein case.
 The report drew immediate condemnation from Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, who has questioned Justice Department officials about the plea deal repeatedly.
 “Letting a well-connected billionaire get away with child rape and international sex trafficking isn’t ‘poor judgment’ – it is a disgusting failure. Americans ought to be enraged,” Sasse said. “Jeffrey Epstein should be rotting behind bars today, but the Justice Department failed Epstein’s victims at every turn.”
 The report concluded that Acosta, who took responsibility in interviews for his decisions, had the authority as the U.S. attorney “to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his decision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors.” The office said its investigation had turned up no evidence that Acosta was swayed by “impermissible considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations” and in fact had resisted efforts by defense lawyers to return the case to the state for whatever outcome the state wanted.
 The report also did not find that a well-publicized 2007 breakfast meeting with one of Epstein’s attorneys led to the non-prosecution agreement – which had been signed weeks earlier – “or to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein.” Records reviewed by the office show that prosecutors weighed concerns about witness credibility and the impact of a trial on victims, as well as Acosta’s concerns about the Justice Department’s proper role in prosecuting solicitation crimes.
 “Accordingly,” the report said, “OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional misconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other subjects committed professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.”

Some people have argued that Disney is doing this intentionally, essentially reviving the old Disney Vault with these typically hard-to-find titles the way they did with animated favorites like _Pinocchio_ and _Aladdin_. Putting it bluntly, there are two options when you consider this argument. Either this argument is flat-out wrong or it implies that Disney+ is overvaluing this content to a strange degree. _Make Mine Music_ , for example, is a must-watch for any true fan or completist of Disney animation. It’s never been released officially in HD quality. (One of its segments, a riff on the Western battle between the Hatfields and the McCoys, has a fair amount of cartoon gunplay.) But the casual viewer won’t care _quite_ that much about a 40s-era package film being made available on Disney+. The same can be said for the anthology episodes, and plenty of other examples. These all _should_ be made available on Disney+, but treating them like some of the studio’s most beloved and popular films is…weird, to say the least.
