 The spokesperson of Western Railways said the Sharmik Special mentioned in the video started its journey on May 21 and completed it on May 24.
 The train was diverted because of network congestion on the Uttar Pradesh- Bihar route.
 Replying to the video post on Twitter, Western Railways said, “It is stated that as 80% Shramik Special trains were headed to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the Jabalpur-Satna-Manikpur route got congested, owing to which some trains were run on diverted routes for two days only. Now there is no congestion and trains are running on this route. Hence, it is misleading.”
 In a series of tweets on Wednesday, the Ministry of Railways said over 3,500 Shramik Special trains had so far been operated, and they had carried more than 48 lakh passengers. Nearly 80% of these trains were bound for various destinations in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

 “Most of the destinations in Uttar Pradesh are around Lucknow and Gorakhpur and in Bihar around Patna. Convergence of trains on these destinations caused some congestion in a particular section of the network,” it said.
 In a separate release, the Railways said that since May 1, it had operationalised 3,736 Shramik Special trains, transporting 50 lakh migrant workers, and about 67 trains were in the pipeline.
 After complaints of passengers suffering for lack of food and water, the Railways said it had distributed over 85 lakh free meals and 1.25 crore free water bottles to migrants since May 1.

The coronavirus pandemic is putting long-standing relationships between cash- strapped consumers and their banks and insurance companies to the test.  
 Before the outbreak, if a bank made a mistake with a deposit, it might not have been a big deal, said Bruce Clapp, president of Market Match, a financial-marketing company based in Dayton.  
 Now, the sting of a bank failing to help a small-business customer get a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan through the Small Business Administration that it needed to stay afloat hits much harder and might have those customers considering other banks, he said. The same might be true for a customer who couldn't make a mortgage payment and struggled to get relief.  
 "I would never forget it," Clapp said if his bank had let him down during such a crucial time. "When I needed you in my hour of need, you weren't there."  
 On the other hand, banks that have become creative to extend help will score points, he said.  
 "We're going to work with you," Clapp said those banks tell their customers. "We still have strong legs, and so do you."  
 Insurance relationships will be as challenged as consumers who are driving less try to rein in costs.  
 "People are going to need to find a way to save money, and shopping for insurance is one of those ways," said Dean Fadel, president of the Ohio Insurance Institute, an industry group.  
 Insurers have given refunds, dividends, discounts and credits totaling more than $10 billion during the pandemic, according to estimates compiled by the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group. But those are temporary discounts that reflect drivers who have mostly parked their cars in the driveway during the outbreak.  
 "During times like this, cost becomes a critically important feature," said Mark Berven, president and chief operating officer of Nationwide's property and casualty business.  
 That means turning to technology to reduce costs and improve service, he said.  
 One tool to achieve that is telematics, a system in which drivers allow insurers to monitor when, how far and how safely they drive using a smartphone app or a device installed in their car.  
 Such policies can cut rates by as much as 20%, according to industry groups.  
 "Consumers want more control over their experience. They want to do things on the phone. They want usage-based insurance," Berven said.  
 Down the road, telematics is expected to enable more customized and transparent policies for consumers versus the more traditional method of lumping drivers together with those who have similar characteristics, he said.  
 The industry is unlikely to return to old ways of doing things after the pandemic, Berven said.  
 For example, he said, more auto claims will be handled by policyholders snapping photos of the damage to their cars and submitting them to insurers. That's proving to be faster, cheaper and more convenient than the traditional method of having a claims adjuster personally examine the damage.  
 Insurers also will need to be more creative in helping business clients prevent losses, especially in areas such as workers' compensation, said T.J. Obrokta Jr., president and CEO of Encova Insurance.  
 "The best insurance companies have loss control departments to prevent losses; this pandemic will require insurers to work creatively with their insureds to find new ways to help prevent illnesses related to COVID-19," Obrokta said.  
 Rob Wash, a partner at Spreng-Smith Agency, an insurance agency in Ashland, said the industry may eventually put language into insurance policies to cover virus outbreaks.  
 "The industry will change from this, I don't think we know specifically yet exactly how," he said.  
 In banking, the pandemic has encouraged more consumers to do more banking online, a trend in place since before the outbreak, but which has picked up steam since most bank lobbies have been closed during the outbreak.  
 Consumers will do more work online, including sign documents electronically, said James Thurston, spokesman for the Ohio Bankers League.  
 "Customer relationships will be more critical than ever," Thurston said.  
 Unlike the Great Recession, when many banks failed, those institutions are far better prepared to withstand what's ahead for the economy, said Matt Miller, president of Park National Bank in Newark.  
 "The banking industry is in a much better spot today than it was in 2007, 2008. Banks increased capital levels and became more prepared for the next downturn or recession."  
 The severity of this downturn will take time to determine, he said: "The impact on the bank will depend on how the economy comes back and how long the unemployment may last."

It sports that brutal moment when Cagney's Tom shoves a grapefruit into his girlfriend Kitty's (Mae Clarke) face - a scene we revisit in films like _The Big Heat_ and _The Long Goodbye_. The influence of this film on all that came behind it is massive. It's one of the major headwaters of the genre.
