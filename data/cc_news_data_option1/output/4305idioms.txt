A weak front is pushing through our area and rain will continue on and off throughout the evening hours in the region. Cloud cover will stick around into tomorrow and portions of early next week as the front will turn stationary for the next day or so. This will increase our chances of spotty showers for the early work week. As we move into the middle of the week there will be another front that will bring a good chance of precipitation. This front will interact with a tropical system sometime next week and will bring widespread rain coverage to our region.   LATE next week, a cool down is on the way as a block of High pressure will move in.

FALL RIVER - Elio Younes wants his customers to wake up and smell the coffee.
 He says the coffee machine inside the new Riverside Gas & Diesel -- located at the corner of North Main Street and President Avenue -- will not be typical of what one usually finds in most other convenience stores and self-serve gas stations.
 "It will have a touchscreen (and) will grind the beans while you wait," Younes said, referring to what is known in the coffee-machine industry as a self- serve "bean to cup" system.
 He says despite the fact that the machine cost more than $12,000, a small cup of joe, with tax, will cost less than two bucks.
 Younes, 24, will manage Riverside Gas & Diesel, which he said should be open for business within the next two weeks, on behalf of the owner, who happens to be his father Sam.
 The elder Younes, 58, bought the property more than a year ago.
 He puts his total investment -- including land purchase, new gas pumps, a repaved parking lot, landscaping and convenience store -- at close to $1.5 million.
 Sam Younes started working in the United States as an auto mechanic in the Worcester area, after emigrating 25 years ago from Lebanon. He also owns and operates an auto repair, service station in Franklin and the Fairhaven Gas Minimart.
 "I like the town," he said, referring to Fall River. "And I like that it's next to the school so we can keep all the kids happy."
 Younes says the Riverside name makes perfect sense considering that the Taunton River is within walking distance of the busy intersection.
 It's been at least a decade since the land parcel at 1101 North Main St. has been utilized for a business.
 At one time it was a Texaco gas station with an independently owned repair shop. Going back to the 1990s you could even buy a used car there.
 Elio Younes says the old gas station that came with the land was razed last April and has since been replaced with a 2,000-square-foot, rectangular-shaped building.
 There will also be six self-serve gas and diesel fuel pumps, all of which face perpendicular to the long, narrow building.
 Younes anticipates hiring three to five part-time employees.
 Riverside Gas & Diesel has a beer and wine license. Younes says he's buying beer from three separate vendors and wine from two vendors.
 "I don't drink, so I don't know much about brands," he said. "I told them (vendors) to treat it like it's your store, because it's their business too."
 Tentative hours at the seven-day-a-week operation, he said, will be 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.
 That way, Younes said, there won't be any chance of a clerk accidentally selling an alcoholic beverage past the 11 p.m. legal limit.
 The store will also have a small cigar humidor, a unisex bathroom for customers and will sell lottery tickets.
 Even though he helped his father while going to high school, he said being a full-time manager in Fall River, while also keeping an eye on the Fairhaven gas station and convenience store, will be somewhat of a change of pace.
 Younes says he enlisted in the Army in December 2014.
 "I loved it," he said.
 After basic training in Missouri, he lived in various states and became a combat engineer. He eventually also managed to attend classes at the University of Massachusetts where he earned a business degree.
 But Younes, who is single, says he decided not to reenlist for active duty in order to go into business with his father on a full-time basis.
 "I thought it was time for a new page in my life," he said. "My father has lived the American dream, and it's the least I can do for him and my country."
 Younes is now a member of the Army National Guard. Once a month, he said, he puts his combat engineering skills to use by instructing other soldiers, using simulation-based training, in how to use an M4 carbine rifle and Humvee vehicles.
 He says he's particularly proud of the fact that his father has been recognized as "a patriotic employer" by the Defense Department program known as the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve.
 It took a few months before his father stumbled upon the Fall River site. Younes says they previously had looked at properties from Bellingham to Worcester and closer to Boston.
 "But we just love this area," Younes said. "The SouthCoast is beautiful. The Portuguese people are great (and) you've got some amazing food here. It's diverse, and it's kind of quiet."
 Younes, who now lives in New Bedford and says he intends to eventually buy a house in Fairhaven, said when was a UMass student he transferred from Amherst to the Dartmouth campus so that he could live in the state's southeast region.
 He says he has a younger sister in college studying psychology and an older brother who works as an engineer for Fidelity Investment. His mother, he said, still helps out in the family business.
 Younes said he worked with a designer to come up with the blue-and-green business logo: "The blue is for the ocean, and the green is very refreshing," he said.
 The closest competition in terms of physical proximity to Riverside Gas & Diesel is the 7 Hills gas station, which has a much smaller building and sits directly across the street.
 Both gas stations sell unbranded gasoline.
 "Everyone gets their share of the pie," Younes said, adding that "he has to make a living. I hope he does well, too."
 Younes said the pandemic is hurting gas stations as result of fewer drivers on the road and more people working from home.
 But the neighborhood is full of triple decker apartment houses, and he's confident the new and inviting store will make up for any reduction in gasoline revenue.
 "We'll make money down the road -- I just want everyone's health to be better," Younes said.
 "And I'm hoping that one day, with God's blessing, I'll build more gas stations," he added.

Usually, a bad loss can be flushed to a degree. South Carolina gets a bye after this game, and a coaching staff getting paid more than $8 million a year will be tasked with washing away whatever hangover comes with this.
 But it's going to leave a mark on the collective psyche of those who follow the team and want the Gamecocks to do well.
 Will Muschamp and his staff won't get fired this year, not with the state of athletic department fiances. The Auburn win provides enough buttress to prevent a complete collapse that makes even the most dire money situation seem flexible.
 But a win or even a spirited loss? That builds a staff goodwill. Goodwill isn't 100% needed if the wins are flowing (though they tend to go together), but in tight spots it's a factor that helps.
 And getting beat to a pulp in a game that looked pretty favorable? Well, that builds "badwill." Lots of it.
 Three-hour odysseys of miscues and shoddy defense? Those put folks in a bad mood in a venture (college sports) that lives on excitement.
 If you had told most anyone prognosticating that South Carolina's season the Gamecocks would be 2-3 at the open week, they'd most likely take it. But circumstances change, and the trip to LSU could've yielded many outcomes that were reasonable. Getting housed wasn't one of them.
 "It was a huge opportunity, of course," quarterback Collin Hill said. "We came off two wins. We were ready to go, but didn't make enough plays."
 Barring something dramatic, 2021 is going to be the prove-it year for this staff. This was supposed to be that year, but the unusual nature of 2020 saw that almost everyone gets a mulligan.
 But games like Saturday's, they burn through goodwill and patience. South Carolina is probably a program that needs to develop consistency before it takes big steps forward. After after a week of cautious optimism raising hopes, the Gamecocks' play hammered home the point that consistency feels a long way off.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice President Mike Pence plans to maintain an aggressive campaign schedule this week despite his exposure to a top aide who tested positive for the coronavirus, the White House said Saturday.Pence himself tested negative, his office said. Under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, the vice president is considered a “close contact” of his chief of staff, Marc Short, but will not quarantine, said spokesman Devin O’Malley. O’Malley said Pence decided to maintain his travel schedule “in consultation with the White House Medical Unit” and “in accordance with the CDC guidelines for essential personnel.” Those guidelines require that essential workers exposed to someone with the coronavirus closely monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 and wear a mask whenever around other people.O’Malley said Pence and his wife, Karen, both tested negative on Saturday “and remain in good health.” Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease expert at George Mason University, called Pence’s decision to travel “grossly negligent” regardless of the stated justification that Pence is an essential worker.“It’s just an insult to everybody who has been working in public health and public health response,” she said. “I also find it really harmful and disrespectful to the people going to the rally” and the people on Pence’s own staff who will accompany him.“He needs to be staying home 14 days,” she added. “Campaign events are not essential.”After a day of campaigning in Florida on Saturday, Pence was seen wearing a mask as he returned to Washington aboard Air Force Two shortly after the news of Short’s diagnosis was made public. He is scheduled to hold a rally on Sunday afternoon in Kinston, NC.Pence, who has headed the White House coronavirus task force since late February, has repeatedly found himself in an uncomfortable position balancing political concerns with the administration’s handling the pandemic that has killed more than 220,000 Americans. The vice president has advocated mask-wearing and social distancing, but often does not wear one himself and holds large political events where many people do not wear face-coverings.By virtue of his position as vice president, Pence is considered an essential worker. The White House did not address how Pence’s political activities amounted to essential work.Short’s diagnosis comes weeks after the coronavirus spread through the White House, infecting President Donald Trump, the first lady, and two dozen other aides, staffers and allies.Short, Pence’s top aide and one of his closest confidants, did not travel with the vice president on Saturday.Pence’s handling of his exposure to a confirmed positive case stands in contrast to how Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris responded when a close aide and a member of her campaign plane’s charter crew tested positive for the virus earlier this month. She took several days off the campaign trail citing her desire to act out of an abundance of caution.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A squandered chance followed by a great stop led to the only scoring of the third quarter. Miami marched 88 yards across 16 plays to add a 20-yard field goal that allowed the Hurricanes to take a 13-7 lead into the fourth quarter.
 It took an impressive UVa goal-line stand to force the 20-yard field goal, but Nick Grant missed what would’ve been an interception return for a touchdown near midfield during the middle of the drive. The Virginia cornerback jumped a screen pass perfectly, but whiffed on the ball, which squirted off his chest and fell incomplete.
 After bending but not breaking, Virginia’s defense broke on a Miami drive spanning the end of the third quarter and start of the fourth quarter. Miami drove 80 yards in 12 plays against a fatigued UVa defense. The Hurricanes’ lead swelled to 19-7 with 12:04 left after a touchdown run from Donald Chaney Jr. and a failed two-point conversion.

I think we have to come to grips with the fact that America is still struggling with certain things. Whether it be race, whether it be poverty, whether it be violence. And so I think hip-hop offers an exciting opportunity to look back on these moments — and not only chronicle history and culture in America, and the tension between generations and communities — I think it's also a great American story in regards to the way young black folk, young poor folk, folk of color in America are grappling with these things: commercialism, hyperconsumption. These are things that are not only central to young people, but central to the American experience.
