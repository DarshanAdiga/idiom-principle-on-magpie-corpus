The economy is in shambles and unrest due to systematic racism is affecting communities across the country. There is chaos and corruption in the current government, and a leader who disparages the military. If this was a business, the CEO would be fired. We have a chance to fire our CEO (Donald Trump), and the policy makers under him who turn a blind eye to all his bad decisions. They do not deserve another term, they have failed in the most basic tenant of governance, keeping us safe.

"People don't feel safe in their neighborhoods," he said. That's causing businesses to move out of cities, including Spokane, he told a Republican women's meeting recently.
 Asked for statistics on businesses leaving Spokane, which local economists said they were unaware of, Larkin backed off and said he didn't recall mentioning Spokane but has talked to business owners who say they are leaving Seattle.
 Washington's crime rate has fluctuated between 2013 and 2019, the last year for which full statistics exist, but has tracked national trends and stayed consistently below the national rate, data from the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs show.
 Larkin acknowledged that state law only allows the attorney general's office to intervene in such cases if the local prosecuting attorney or the governor asks. Those requests typically come from rural counties with small offices facing big cases, like a murder.
 "I would train up a team of prosecutors willing and able to assist," he said, then send out the word around the state. "We're here. We're standing by the phone. I think they would call. I would hope they would."
 He would also ask the Legislature to pass a law giving the attorney general's office the authority to help city prosecutors, something it currently lacks.
 Ferguson said his office provides prosecutors to counties when asked and recently handled a murder case in Ferry County and has a case involving sexual misconduct charges against a sitting judge in Asotin County. But he can't force his staff on county prosecutors, and he questions the fiscal sense of setting aside staff to help with requests from city prosecutors, who only handle misdemeanors.
 One of the main duties of the attorney general's office is defending state officials, agencies and legislation in court. Larkin, who has campaigned at times with GOP gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp, said he could defend Initiative 1639, which added new gun-control restrictions, even though he disagrees with it.
 For law enforcement officials who say they won't enforce it -- which Culp, the Republic police chief, has said ever since the initiative passed -- Larkin said those officials have the discretion to decide what laws to enforce and exercise it all the time.
 "What I struggle with is them openly saying it, because it is a dangerous precedent," he said. "You get into slippery slopes."
 Someone running for attorney general also should follow state laws, Ferguson said, and that includes the current restrictions on gatherings and requirements for wearing face coverings that are part of the emergency orders issued by Gov. Jay Inslee. Larkin has appeared at rallies with larger crowds than those restrictions allow, where most people didn't wear masks.
 "You can't violate the law to further your political views," he said.
 Larkin, a Gonzaga Law School graduate who also has a masters of law degree from George Washington University, served in the George W. Bush White House and currently works as legal counsel for his family's pipe manufacturing company. He said the state would benefit from an attorney general with the "fresh perspective of a business owner" and one who is not a "career politician."
 At campaign events, Larkin has suggested Ferguson "never had a real job," something the incumbent countered by saying he's worked at a range of jobs, from dishwasher to educator, and that Larkin is denigrating their work. He graduated from New York University Law School, clerked for U.S. District Judge Frem Nielsen in Spokane and was a member of a large Seattle law firm before serving on the King County Council.
 Ferguson also said Larkin has overstated his experience as a prosecutor in Spokane and Pierce counties. Larkin served as student volunteer known as an extern in the Spokane County prosecutor's office while at Gonzaga, so would have needed supervision by an attorney, and only worked for about two months in Pierce County as a deputy prosecutor before leaving to help with the family business.
 Larkin defended the description, saying he did do some courtroom work by himself as a Gonzaga extern and mentioned his supervisor Brian O'Brien.
 O'Brien said later he had no specific recollection of Larkin's work but that externs were allowed to do some District Court work by themselves "after an appropriate period of supervision."

It’s always hard to know which candidate to believe come election time. They extoll their records and some then scramble to re-write their history. It’s the latter who bother me, denying their past, just to get re-elected or even worse saying one thing to Montanans then voting the opposite. These are the actions that give politicians a bad name. Our junior senator, Steve Daines, unfortunately falls into this category.
 On public lands, health care, education and many other issues Daines has continued his ugly habit of saying one thing to Montanans then voting the opposite. Health care is the perfect example, saying he favors good health care for Montanans while voting to take away health care provisions we already have. He’s tries to have it both ways. Montanans don’t like people who break their word or people who are afraid to take a stand on important issues. If you try to believe in everything you essentially believe in nothing.

KEARNEY — The city of Kearney is focusing on Porter Ridge Road and possible improvements to its surface.
 With a bid coming in from Amino Brothers to the tune of $103,000, the city considers a two-inch mill and overlay, which means to tear up the surface and replace it with a new layer of asphalt, from Missouri Highway 92 south and east to the end of the cul-de-sac.
 "The board approved the 2020 street repair list with a $490,000 budget at their July meeting," City Administrator Jim Eldridge said in an email.
 That list was reduced by an approximate $100,000 worth of projects in light of coronavirus. Still included on the list is future work patching asphalt in other areas of Kearney, paint striping at Bennett Boulevard and on Nation Road.
 "Our bids were good this year — we expected unit prices to increase, but they stayed the same," Eldridge continued. "With Porter Ridge Road overlay work added to the scope, staff estimates that the over repairs work will be well below the $490,000 budget."
 Kearney's Public Works Department recommends approval of the bid.
 "Porter Ridge is in the Marimack subdivision," Eldridge said, "and the work is needed."
 This issue will be introduced to the board during its Monday, Oct. 5 meeting.

“They had me a little bit worried, but they fought back,” Hansen said. “They are pretty good at doing that. We tend to be able to stay focused. They are working hard on staying focused and in control.
 “We have a few drills to work on that. We are trying to stay in control of the ball, not so much having to score every single time. They work on control, focus and make sure that they are playing good game ball.”
 Lincoln carried the momentum from the first set into the second. The Lady Golden Bears made quick work of the young Lady Aggies, winning 25-7.
 “Sometimes teams, and my team included, when they fall behind, they lay back and lay off,” Hansen said. “Once we won that first set when they got so far ahead of us … it seemed to take a little bit out of them.”
 Swain was named the MVP of the tournament. The senior recorded 27 kills for the Lady Golden Bears.
 “She is just good on the net,” Hansen said. “Neither one of my middle (blockers) Kinsley (Smith) or Brittany had very many blocks because we didn’t have a lot of hits coming from our opponents (Saturday).
 “Brittany is what I call my silent leader. She is not real vocal, but she knows how to get the job done. She plays well for us. She had some spectacular hits and kills for us. I am proud of what she did.”
 Bailey Gowers, Jayce Woods, and Kinsley Smith were tabbed to the all-county team.
 Hansen was pleased with the way all of her players played on Saturday.
 “Maddie Barnhart stepped up and played good (Saturday),” Hansen said. “Emma Hobbs played well (Saturday).
 “The day was a hard day for the back row. We didn't play a lot of big-hitting teams today, but when we needed the back row, they stepped up. Mckynlee Young, Haylee-Grace Mullinax, Bailey Ruggs, Kam Carr. It was a hard game for them because they didn’t get a lot of play. They stepped up and made great passes, they got it to the setter to set up the assist to get the kill. The back row was very instrumental in getting what we needed to be done.”

For many progressive opinion-makers, the only way to save the Supreme Court is to destroy it. They believe the best response to the Republican-held Senate confirming a Trump nominee to fill Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat on the Supreme Court is to pack the Court if Democrats win in November. Holding out the court-packing threat, they argue, also might give Republicans second thoughts about filling the vacancy.
 For the Democrats, court-packing would be a murder-suicide. It would end the Supreme Court as we know it, and almost certainly bring a swift and decisive end to Democratic congressional majorities. There’s a reason Republicans aren’t taking the threat seriously in their calculations. No matter how infuriated a party is, the rules of political gravity still apply. A president is at the high point of his power at the outset, steadily losing juice over time. Would Biden spend precious capital on court-packing early in his presidency?
 If so, voting, green energy and health care legislation would take a back seat. If, instead, all of that legislation went first, then court-packing would be pushed toward the back of the line, when Biden would have diminished clout for the political fight of a lifetime. The question of timing would enter in another way. If Democrats managed to add Court seats in the second year of a Biden presidency, how much time and political capital would they have left to fill them before the midterms?
 If Republicans took back the Senate, they certainly wouldn’t fill them. And, of course, when Republicans hold the presidency and Congress again, they’d add their own seats or subtract the Democratic ones, making the entire exercise a nullity. It’s also true that, as a general rule, big changes happen in our system when a party makes a sustained public case for them prior to an election.
 Very few elected Democrats are willing to come out in favor of packing the court, and Biden the other day pointedly refused to endorse it. Making court- packing the major initiative of his presidency would be an awkward fit for Biden. It would validate the critique of him as weak and prone to getting pushed around by the left. It would blow up his hope to bring some normality back to Washington. It would inexorably make the destruction of the legitimacy of the Supreme Court part of his legacy, when he imagines himself an institutionalist.
 The argument that Republicans have already “packed the court” is a false equivalence. Yes, Republicans have used hardball tactics to keep open, or now to try to fill, vacancies. But these seats opened up in the natural course of events. They weren’t conjured out of nowhere in a fit of pique or vengeance. It easy to pound the table and demand an incredibly momentous change to our system when you don’t have power and don’t have to cope with the consequences.
 It’s another to act in the face of vigorous opposition and with nervous officeholders in marginal districts or states looking for a way out. No matter how much progressives want elected Democrats to write the ransom note, they aren’t going to take the Supreme Court captive next year, let alone kill the hostage.

_Tokyo, 02 ott 07:58 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- I cittadini giapponesi potranno ottenere gratuitamente la vaccinazione contro il nuovo coronavirus, secondo una nuova direttiva politica approvata dal ministero della Salute di quel paese oggi, 2 ottobre. Il governo giapponese sta tentando di assicurarsi entro la prima metà del 2021 una quantità di vaccini sufficiente ad immunizzare l’intera popolazione del paese, ed ha riservato a tal fine un bilancio di 671,4 miliardi di yen (6,4 miliardi di dollari). Ad oggi Tokyo ha già sottoscritto contratti di fornitura con le compagnie farmaceutiche AstraZeneca Plc e Pfizer Inc, e ne sta negoziando uno analogo con un terzo colosso del farmaco, Moderna Inc. Ad oggi nessuna delle tre aziende ha completato lo sviluppo di un vaccino efficace. Il ministero della Salute ha anche presentato una proposta di emendamento che renderebbe lo Stato direttamente responsabile delle eventuali reazioni avverse alla vaccinazione.

The driver of the suspect vehicle, identified as Long, hit part of a spike strip and his vehicle ended up running off the road and through a cow pasture, causing damage to a fence and the vehicle.
 The Washington State Patrol advised that the vehicle, which had been spray painted a different color, had been stolen two days earlier out of Everett.
 Troopers reported that Long appeared to be “on the nod” and Long admitted to injecting heroin 20 minutes prior to the pursuit and “swallowing everything else” once the pursuit ended.
 Law enforcement searched the car and found spray paint cans that matched the color of the spray painted vehicle, syringes containing suspected heroin and methamphetamine and suspected burglary tools.
 Long told police that his former drug dealer had offered him more drugs if he drove the vehicle north of Tacoma. Long was not sure what city he was in at the time of his arrest.
 The state patrol was later advised that the same vehicle had been involved in a pursuit in Clark County earlier in the morning on the same day, but the vehicle had gotten away.
 Long is scheduled to be arraigned on Oct. 8.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump have tested positive for the coronavirus, he said Friday. The positive test comes a month until the election and after the president has spent the year largely downplaying the threat of the virus.
   
 Trump's positive test comes just hours after the White House announced that senior aide Hope Hicks had come down with the virus after traveling with the president several times this week. Trump was last seen by reporters returning to the White House on Thursday evening and looked to be in good health. Trump is 74 years old, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has now killed more than 205,000 people nationwide.
   
 "Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!" Trump tweeted.
   
 In a memorandum, the president's physician said that the president and first lady "are both well at this time" and "plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence."
   
 "Rest assured I expect the President to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering," he added.
   
 Trump had announced earlier in an interview with Fox News that he and the first lady were awaiting their results.
   
 The diagnosis marks a major blow for a president who has been trying desperately to convince the American public that the worst of the pandemic is behind them even as cases continue to rise just weeks before the Nov. 3 election. And it stands as the most serious known public health scare encountered by any sitting American president in recent history.
   
 Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough and breathing trouble. Most people develop only mild symptoms. But some people, usually those with other medical complications, develop more severe symptoms, including pneumonia, which can be fatal.
   
 In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday, Trump said he was awaiting results of a COVID-19 test. "Whether we quarantine or whether we have it, I don't know," he said, adding that first lady Melania Trump was also awaiting results.
   
 Hicks traveled with the president multiple times this week, including aboard Marine One, the presidential helicopter, and on Air Force One to a rally in Minnesota on Wednesday, and aboard Air Force One to Tuesday night's first presidential debate in Cleveland.
   
 Trump had consistently played down concerns about being personally vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, even after White House staff and allies were exposed and sickened.
   
 "I felt no vulnerability whatsoever," he said told reporters back in May.
   
 He has instead encouraged governors to reopen their states and tried to focus the nation's attention on efforts to revive the economy -- not a growing death toll -- as he seeks another four-year term.
   
 The news was sure to rattle an already shaken nation still grappling with how to safely reopen while avoiding further spikes. The White House has access to near-unlimited resources, including a constant supply of quick-result tests, and still failed to keep the president safe, raising questions about how the rest of the country will be able to protect its workers, students and the public as businesses and schools reopen.
   
 Senior staff have been tested for COVID-19 daily since two people who work at the White House complex tested positive in early May, prompting the White House to step up precautions. Everyone who comes into contact with the president also receives a quick-result test.
   
 Yet since the early days of the pandemic, experts have questioned the health and safety protocols at the White House and asked why more wasn't being done to protect the commander in chief. Trump continued to shake hands with visitors long after public health officials were warning against it and he initially resisted being tested. He has been reluctant to practice his own administration's social distancing guidelines for fear of looking weak, including refusing under almost all circumstances to wear a mask in public.
   
 Trump is not the only major world leader known to have contracted the virus. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care, where he was given oxygen and watched around the clock by medical workers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel self-isolated after a doctor who gave her a vaccination tested positive for the virus, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau worked from home after his wife fell ill.
   
 The White House got its first COVID-19 scare in early March when at least three people who later tested positive came in close proximity to the president at his private Florida club. That included members of the Brazilian president's delegation, including the Brazilian charge d'affaires, who sat at Trump's dinner table.
   
 In mid-March, as the virus continued to spread across the country, the White House began taking the temperature of everyone entering the White House complex, and in April, it began administering rapid COVID-19 tests to all those in close proximity to the president, with staffers being tested about once a week. The frequent tests gave some staff the false impression the complex was safe from the virus, and few, as a result, followed recommended safety protocols, including wearing masks.
   
 But then the bubble broke.
   
 On May 7, the White House announced that a member of the military serving as one of the president's personal valets tested positive for the virus, followed a day later by a positive diagnosis for Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary.
   
 Even then, Trump said he was "not worried" about the virus spreading in the White House. But officials again stepped up safety protocols for the complex, directing everyone entering the West Wing to wear a mask.
   
 "I think it's very well contained, actually," Trump told reporters on May 11.
   
 But by June, concerns at the White House had dissipated once again, with few staffers bothering with masks even as more and more people tested positive for the virus, including campaign staffers preparing for a Tulsa rally and Secret Service agents.
   
 On July 3rd, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., tested positive in South Dakota before an Independence Day fireworks show at Mount Rushmore. Guilfoyle, a former Fox News personality who works for Trump's campaign, had not flown on Air Force One and had not been in direct contact with the president, though she had had contact with numerous top GOP officials.
   
 In July, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, tested positive.
   
 While there is currently no evidence that Trump is seriously ill, the positive test also raises questions about what would happen if he were to become incapacitated due to illness. The Constitution's 25th Amendment spells out the procedures under which a president can declare themselves "unable to discharge the powers and duties" of the presidency. If he were to make that call, Trump would transmit a written note to the Senate president pro tempore, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pence would serve as acting president until Trump transmitted "a written declaration to the contrary."
   
 The vice president and a majority of either the Cabinet or another body established by law, can also declare the president unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, in which case Pence would "immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President" until Trump could provide a written declaration to the contrary.

Let’s make some wobbly assumptions and look to the future. Suppose the country survives the onslaught of lies — or “alternative facts,” as Kellyanne Conway (remember her?) used to call the stream-of-conscious gibberish Donald Trump tweets and screams at rallies — and Joe Biden wins the election. Then we get past all of Trump’s post-election chicanery or something even more serious and Biden is declared the winner.
 At the time of the election, the Trump presidency would have more than two months to go. That is plenty of time for Trump to do a huge amount of damage while still in office. He could approve any number of malicious policies and corrupt giveaways. He could pardon all of his buddies.
 There are wars he could start, and there is little that Biden could do about it until he is inaugurated. Until noon, Jan. 21, 2021, Trump remains POTUS, with enormous power to act against his political enemies or give further leeway to certain special interests — especially his own special interest. Sometime in the afternoon on that Wednesday, new President Biden would have to undo all that outgoing President Trump has done, particularly during the transition period. But what about the pardons?
 There is not much Biden can do. You can’t unpardon someone. But what about pardoning Donald Trump? Biden will have to decide whether to allow federal criminal prosecution to proceed investigating all the crimes that Trump has allegedly perpetrated while in office — or before, when it comes to charges of obstruction, extortion and the tax problems that The New York Times has just alleged, the ones Trump says are “fake news.” By now we have learned that what he calls fake news is actually true. “Absolutely!” you shout.
 But do we want to go down the road to a Banana Republic? Is the United States of America going to take that authoritarian step? We already stand accused of criminalizing politics, where independent counsels pop up like whack-a-moles and those on the periphery of any presidency get in legal trouble, even sent to jail, or are bankrupted by attorney fees. Do we want to make the spectacle of a trial and maybe conviction the price you can expect to pay for leadership? We need to tread that path very carefully.
 Can a president, before he leaves office, pardon himself for any crimes or future accusations of federal law violations? In the Nixon years, a Justice Department memorandum said no because of “the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.” But the Constitution contains no such limitation, except in cases of impeachment. But American tradition is that “no man is above the law.” The conflict is not resolved. Note that the pardon or commutation power does not cover state or local violations, only “offenses against the United States.”
 Nor does it involve civil law or, as we are reminded by The Times’ reporting on his tax accounting, being audited. Donald Trump has long experience being sued and audited. Trump will “not go gentle into that good night.” He attracts the spotlight too much. Of course, as I mentioned, he must lose the election in November, which is a dicey proposition, since Trump knows that when he leaves the White House he steps into legal jeopardy.

In July, the Trump administration turned New Mexico into a tactical area on law-and-order efforts by deploying federal agents to Albuquerque, along with other Democrat-led cities. Trump brought relatives of an Albuquerque murder victim to the White House to announce the initiative. That was followed in August by U.S. Justice Department legal challenges to pandemic restrictions on reopening schools and private school regulations from the Democratic administration of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham -- a distant cousin by marriage of Rep. Lujan.

If hope is the thing with feathers, as Emily Dickinson said, then we've all been going through a major plucking in recent months. For me, working at and writing for the _Reader_ (which I've done, off and on, since 1992, starting back when we were still occupying several floors at 11 E. Illinois) has always been a source of joy. So on Wednesday, March 11, when I left the current (much smaller) _Reader_ offices, I was thinking, "Well, may not be back for a couple of weeks or so, depending on how this COVID-19 situation plays out."

He has been reluctant to practice his own administration’s social distancing guidelines for fear of appearing weak, including refusing under almost all circumstances to wear a mask in public.
 In a statement, White House spokesman Judd Deere said: “The president takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously.”
 “White House Operations collaborates with the physician to the president and the White House Military Office to ensure all plans and procedures incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting Covid-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible both on complex and when the president is travelling,” he added.
 Mr Trump is not the only major world leader known to have contracted the virus. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent time hospital, including three nights in intensive care, where he was given oxygen and watched around the clock by medical workers.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel self-isolated after a doctor who gave her a vaccination tested positive for the virus, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau worked from home after his wife fell ill.

Schurman’s second goal, in the 34th minute, gave the Gazelles a 5-0 cushion at halftime. Yankton closed the scoring with Christensen’s goal in the 65th minute, and the Gazelles had a handful of shots to end the game early via the mercy rule.
 “The biggest thing is, our combinations worked and we found feet with our passes,” Schuring said.
 “We’ve struggled to score this season, so it was really nice for our girls to see the net ripple a few times.”
 Senior Rachel Hebda began the game at goalkeeper for the Gazelles and freshman Alex Schmidt came in to close the game.
 By that point, the outcome was already decided.
 “We really wanted that dub (win) before playoffs,” Christensen said.
 Yankton will hit the road for next Tuesday’s first round matchup against No. 3 Rapid City Stevens.
 “Either way, we know we’ll have a tough matchup, so we’ll have to play defense like we did in the first half against Aberdeen Central,” Schuring said.
 “The competition is going to be stiff, so we’ll need to stay organized and keep to our formations.”
 Yankton beat Huron 8-0 in Thursday’s junior varsity game, thanks to three goals from Keira Christ, and one goal each from Carly Cap, Hannah Tramp, Chloe Blom, Monica Massey and Eleanor Johnson. Alex Schmidt and Renee Stehlik combined for the shutout in goal.

“You’re watching a man unravel before your eyes. This is no ordinary person, this is the person who is currently the president and apparently cannot keep himself together long enough to allow the person across from him to speak uninterrupted. It should be extremely troubling for all Americans. I don’t think they even need two more debates. Americans saw enough [Tuesday] night.”
 Brittany Smalls, a Pennsylvania state coordinator for the Black Voters Matter Fund, agreed. She said the president’s remarks were nothing short of incitement.
 “The highlight of it as a Black person is the fact that our current sitting president completely didn’t denounce white supremacy,” Smalls said. “He is trying to incite a civil war. I don’t think he cares about Black people being oppressed. He just wants to keep his base solid to keep the votes coming in. He just doesn’t care about Black people.”
 Smalls added that Trump “had a point” when he called out Biden for sponsoring a 1994 crime bill that’s been noted for criminalizing Black people and driving mass incarceration.
 “The thing about it is, that’s why Black people are not comfortable with voting in this current [election] cycle because they don’t have any representation,” Smalls said. “We’re in a cycle where it’s hard to engage young Black voters, and Biden is not doing anything to aid and giving responses needed so the people can really feel comfortable supporting him. They are looking for the truth. Just acknowledge it happened and the detriment that it was to the Black community.”
 Smalls is currently traveling Pennsylvania and Ohio to engage communities in the political process and said she has observed that, although the Democratic Party has been the party that “our ancestors and forefathers stuck with,” a new generation of Black voters are not as convinced that they are the party to support.
 “No disrespect to our senior voters and super voters ... [but] when they decided that the Democratic Party was the party we were going to support, our ancestors and forefathers stuck with that and no matter what happened, they supported the Democratic Party,” she said. “Now we have a new regime of young people that’s saying, ‘No more. We are going to stand up for ourselves. Ya’ll are not just going to spoon feed us the information that you want but you are going to tell us how we are going to move forward.’
 “We keep ending up in this vicious cycle. We are in a vicious cycle where the cops are still murdering Black people. We’re still in a vicious cycle where we don’t have stability in our communities in terms of education, fair wages and essential housing. So, at the end of the day, it comes to a point you have to say enough is enough, we’re not going to give our votes anymore. We need each candidate to address our concerns.”
 In response to Biden’s comment that he did not plan to defund the police, a demand that has been at the forefront of many demonstrations this summer, Smalls said she was disappointed.
 “People are saying defund the police and create a new order because the current [one] is not working. If something isn’t working, you need to do away with it and he is not respecting that,” she said.
 Tyler described Biden’s approach as politically safe and said he wasn’t surprised.
 “As a person who works on these issues pretty much full time, issues around police accountability, there are definitely going to be differences between how a person like myself would view what needs to happen with changing law enforcement and policing in America and how Joe Biden is going to see it,” Tyler said. “Many of the thoughts and plans we have — elected officials of all stripes are going to push back on because it’s not something that they want to take a gamble on.”
 Salima Suswell, a political strategist and the first Muslim woman to serve on the Pennsylvania Commission for Women, said she has observed voters as being “curious and some hopeful about the Biden-Harris ticket being able to reverse and roll back the damage that has been” done in the past four years.
 “The major concern about President Trump is his refusal to denounce racism, racist acts and racist organizations,” Suswell said. “His alignment with these groups as his base has been a concern since day one of his campaign in 2015. Everyone is concerned about his refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if the results of the election are not in his favor.”
 Suswell said Black Muslims, just as the rest of the Black community, continue to wrestle with economic and social justice issues.
 “We are concerned about the growing rate of unemployment and the ability to financially provide for our families, save for our future and retire comfortably,” Suswell said. “Black Muslims are concerned about affordable health care whether they are a salaried or hourly worker. Black Muslims are concerned about [the] surge of civil unrest due to the brutality experienced by Black people and other minorities by law enforcement. We are concerned about fair funding in all public schools, voter suppression, and the effects of new appointments to SCOTUS. We are concerned about the issues that affect all Americans but disproportionately affect the African-American community.”
 For these reasons, Smalls described this election as one in which Black people would be “fighting for our lives.”
 Even with the skepticism observed toward Biden, she and Tyler advised voters to use a lesser-of-two-evils factor in making their decision.
 “We do remember, we remember both of them from the 1990s, so we are going to go in with our eyes wide open about who has our best interest in mind,” Tyler said. “Neither man is perfect but certainly, in the words of Sonia Sanchez, if it’s a question of lesser evils, give me less evil every time.”
