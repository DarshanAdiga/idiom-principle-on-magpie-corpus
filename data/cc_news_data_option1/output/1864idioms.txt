Though laudable, the fact that major platforms like Facebook and Twitter have banned some manner of digital forgeries does not mean that deepfakes will inevitably be “relegated to sites with too few users to have a major effect.” Those bans do not implement themselves immediately or perfectly. Fakes have to be detected, and then they have to be judged fraudulent in a particular way that contravenes the policy (something that is not always self-evident even when modification is detected). Even then, much of the harm is already done. Because the half-life of social media posts is measured in hours, the harm from deepfakes in the form of nonconsensual porn, misinformation or fraud will come fast and furious, even with well-intended and well-executed policies. The dry, debunking truth will never quite catch up with the sizzling lie. So, yes, deepfakes will continue to “percolate in shady areas,” as suggested, but their best days having an impact through high-volume platforms likely lie ahead of us, not behind us.

Cloud computing enables transmission and storage of large amounts of information and data through the internet. Tencent has so far concentrated mainly on collaborating with Japanese game-related enterprises in the cloud sector.                          In Japan, U.S. IT firms such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have a strong position in the cloud market. Tencent's latest target is expected to intensify competition among them, economists say.                          "In addition to the game business, we will strengthen services" for such fields as video distribution and manufacturing this year, said Zhao Jiannan, managing director of Tencent Cloud for Northeast Asia.                          While declining to mention a specific name, Zhao said Tencent is likely to work with a major Japanese carmaker later this year, adding it will offer support on tapping into the Chinese market to Japanese firms that use cloud computing.                          Zhao said Tencent and Japanese automakers can work in tandem to promote safety technologies and "connected cars" equipped with advanced telecommunication systems.                          He also said that in the electronics area, Tencent will contribute to the creation of next-generation factories, where minor defects in the manufacturing process can be detected using artificial intelligence.                          "We want to develop together in the fields where Japan leads the world, including games, cars and medical services," Zhao said.

First and foremost, this budget-friendly bad boy is predictably set to increase the usable screen real estate of its forerunner, jumping from 6.2 to 6.8 inches while retaining an FHD+ pixel count of around 2200 x 1080 and possibly keeping the overall dimensions in check thanks to that aforementioned waterdrop-style notch replacing the good old fashioned bezels of the Stylo 5.                                                                                                                                                                                                               The triple camera system on the back of the LG Stylo 6 will apparently combine a 13MP primary snapper, 5MP wide angle lens, and 5MP depth sensor, which is certainly better than the single 13MP shooter offered by the Stylo 5 but might not be enough to give the 48 + 16 + 2MP camera arrangement on the Moto G Stylus a run for its money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                Speaking of money, we sure hope the LG Stylo 6 will be able to undercut its direct rival, as it's also only set to pack a 3GB RAM count and 64GB internal storage space, compared to the 4 gigs of memory and 128 gigs of local digital hoarding room provided by the $300 Moto G Stylus. For what it's worth, the LG Stylo 6 looks bound to match the 4,000mAh battery capacity of the Moto G Stylus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                By the way, the LG Stylo 5 initially saw daylight last year on Cricket Wireless before gradually expanding to Boost Mobile, Sprint, Metro, T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T, so we definitely wouldn't rule out a discreet LG Stylo 6 debut taking place at Boost in the next few days or so.

The BBC reported the bill could be as high as ₤340 million ($240 million) for the Premier League, which continued on with talks about "Project Restart" on Monday.                                  "We were able to update our clubs today on our situation with broadcasters, which is obviously confidential," said Premier League CEO Richard Masters. "Whatever happens, there's going to be significant loss of revenue for clubs. That is inevitable.                                  "We were able to paint a picture today about what would happen in various scenarios, playing out the season and not playing out the season, to allow them to have a picture of that as we stand in the early part of May."                                  The rebate to broadcasters would surge to an estimated £760 million if the season cannot be completed. Masters has previously warned of a £1 billion loss once the absence of gate receipts is taken into account.                                  For the first time on Monday, the 20 Premier League clubs discussed the models that may have to be used to determine the final standings if it is not deemed safe to finish the season.                                  New government guidelines have paved the way for professional sports to return behind closed doors in England from June 1.                                  However, England internationals Raheem Sterling and Danny Rose are the two latest high-profile players to raise their concerns over a return to contact sports when the rest of society is being advised to follow social-distancing guidelines.                                  "The moment we do go back it just needs to be a moment where it's not just for footballing reasons, it's safe for not just us footballers but the whole medical staff, referees," Sterling said on his YouTube channel.                                  "(I am) not scared, but reserved and thinking what the worst outcome could be.                                  "I've had friends whose grandma has passed away, I've had family members as well that have passed away."                                  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in parliament on Monday that the return of sports on TV would "provide a much-needed boost to national morale" in a country that has been one of the hardest hit by the global pandemic, with the government officially recording more than 32,000 deaths from COVID-19.                                  "People's lives are at risk," Rose, who is on loan at Newcastle from Tottenham, said during an Instagram live chat.                                  "Football shouldn't even be spoken about coming back until the numbers have dropped massively."                                  But Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of England's Professional Footballers' Association, said many of his members would be open to playing again, provided "everything that can be done is being done" to assure their safety.                                  "We've got to try it, see if we can do it and see if we can return to some form of activity," Taylor told the Mirror.                                  "But it's also being as careful and having as many assurances as possible that it's achievable."                                  The Premier League is due to meet the PFA and the managers' union later this week to discuss protocols for a return to group training.                                  A further complication for Project Restart is where matches would be played, with the clubs opposed to a proposal for a limited number of neutral venues to be used.                                  The U.K.'s national soccer police, has previously stated resuming matches on a home-and-away basis would "present challenges" to the emergency services.                                  But Mark Roberts said on Tuesday that police, government and soccer authorities were working together on a plan "which minimizes any risks to public safety and unnecessary pressure on public services, but facilitates a sensible restart to the season."                                  London Mayor Sadiq Khan has come out against the idea of playing matches in the capital at this stage, with the city having been hit particularly hard by the pandemic.                                  Five of the 20 Premier League sides are based in London.                                  "With the country still in the grips of this crisis, and hundreds of people dying every day, he believes that it is too early to be discussing the resumption of the Premier League and top-flight sport in the capital," Khan's spokesperson told the Evening Standard.

Cloud computing enables transmission and storage of large amounts of information and data through the internet. Tencent has so far concentrated mainly on collaborating with Japanese game-related enterprises in the cloud sector.
 In Japan, U.S. IT firms such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have a strong position in the cloud market. Tencent's latest target is expected to intensify competition among them, economists say.
 "In addition to the game business, we will strengthen services" for such fields as video distribution and manufacturing this year, said Zhao Jiannan, managing director of Tencent Cloud for Northeast Asia.
 While declining to mention a specific name, Zhao said Tencent is likely to work with a major Japanese carmaker later this year, adding it will offer support on tapping into the Chinese market to Japanese firms that use cloud computing.
 Zhao said Tencent and Japanese automakers can work in tandem to promote safety technologies and "connected cars" equipped with advanced telecommunication systems.
 He also said that in the electronics area, Tencent will contribute to the creation of next-generation factories, where minor defects in the manufacturing process can be detected using artificial intelligence.
 "We want to develop together in the fields where Japan leads the world, including games, cars and medical services," Zhao said.

As we saw last season, the Tiger-Cats used a number of tailbacks in their backfield. After Sean Thomas Erlington's season-ending knee injury, they used the likes of Maleek Irons, Jackson Bennett and even Bralon Addison at times to take handoffs. With Thomas Erlington on the mend, Hamilton could go all-Canadian at running back. However, the addition of Don Jackson during free agency changes things. Jackson is a proven starter, and it's likely that offensive coordinator Tommy Condell could give both Jackson and Thomas Erlington equal touches this season.

Publicly, Reade began by speaking out against general "misconduct" by Biden, and later came forward with more details and the full story. Instead of viewing this as the common behavior of sexual assault survivors, Biden campaign staff, NPR, writers from Salon and Vox, as well as some of Reade's previous coworkers, are using this to point out "inconsistency" in Reade's story and discredit her.
 MINIMIZING SEXUAL assault by leaving out specific details or glossing over a painful event as a generalized "he was inappropriate sometimes" or "I felt uncomfortable," is a well-known coping mechanism for victims of sexual assault. There is a certain element of shame or self-blame, in particular, because victims don't want to believe that someone they like or admire - whether a boyfriend or boss - would do such a thing. If it was the victim's "fault," then at least she was "in control" and can prevent it from happening again.
 For Reade, it would have been even more difficult because women are socialized not to be perceived as whiny or weak in the workplace, and women who "make trouble" often face retribution, which Reade claims she faced before even coming forward with the full story. If Reade as a young professional in politics had come forward openly in 1993, does anyone honestly think she would have had any future career?
 What struck me as particularly disturbing about the case of Tara Reade is that, unlike the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh, the alleged assault did not occur when Biden was an intoxicated teenager, but while he was holding public office. Also unlike the Kavanaugh situation, a number of people have stepped forward to corroborate that they knew about this incident when it happened.
 Nevertheless, Instead of supporting and believing Tara Reade, Biden supporters, his staff and Biden himself have outright denied all allegations and attempted to discredit Reade. Others have "questioned her motives."
 Whether with Christine Blasey Ford or with Tara Reade, it's not for the public to "question the motives" of a woman who comes forward after sexual assault. The hypocrisy is stomach-turning. When Kavanagh or Trump were accused, there were marches, rallies, protests and social-media campaigns, but when it's the Democratic candidate who is being accused, we question the accuser's motives.
 Truthfully, history is rife with great men (and women) in public life who were horrendous human beings in their private life. It may be that both Trump and Biden are sexual predators. It may also be that either could be a fantastic president of the United States in their ability to govern. But the American public shouldn't be lied to about the integrity (or its lack) from these men, and Democrats and Republicans alike are harming women when they cover it up or minimize it.
 At the end of the day, the problem isn't the track record of Biden or Trump in their atrocious behavior toward women, and it isn't the Democratic or Republican parties. The problem is that the American people believe that men who sexually assault women are still fit to hold the highest offices in the land. That's why no matter who wins the election in 2020, it is women who will lose.

The customary chain of command goes like this: When the president of the United States and his team have a message for Israel, the message is sent to the secretary of state, who then either informs the prime minister of the message or asks the US ambassador to Israel to pass on the message.
 That's the customary chain. But that model is broken between Trump and Netanyahu.  
 This US president and this Israeli prime minister pick up the phone and talk. And that's what should be happening now - especially now.
 In the heat of the coronavirus pandemic, given the risks of the contagion, given the size of the secretary's team, given the criteria we are all being asked to follow, and given the reason for the visit, it all seems excessive.
 WITH THIS visit, Mike Pompeo will violate a rule that every Israeli - and every person aching to visit Israel - knows. If you travel to Israel you go into quarantine for 14 days. Period, end of discussion. Or so we thought.
 So what if the US State Department has explained that the team and the secretary will be following specific protocols and preserving the six-foot social-distancing policy, or the "bubble of six feet or more" as they put it?
 So what if they get off their plane, have their meeting and get back on the plane? So what if they follow CDC protocols? So what if people on Pompeo's plane will be regularly tested and screened before boarding and while on the plane, and that anyone coming near the team with be screened for COVID-19? So what?
 We all know that everyone is at risk, and that no one is safe no matter how stringent one is with protocols and precautions.
 How often has Netanyahu been tested and even quarantined because members of his inner sanctum have tested positive? Now a personal valet of the US president has tested positive, and the spokeswoman for Vice President Pence who, ironically, is also the spokesperson for the President's Coronavirus Task Force, has also tested positive.
 Rules are rules and they are there for everyone to follow.
 This smacks of a double standard. This visit tells us that rules are there for everyone except for powerful leaders. Just like over the Passover lockdown when, almost across the board - in Israel and in the United States - political leaders had visits from their children while it was forbidden to everyone else.
 What's really going on here is something else. The White House would not be putting the secretary of state and his team and Israeli leadership at risk if they needed only to speak about the pandemic. We can only conclude that there is an important message to be delivered, a message that cannot be trusted to Zoom or Skype or WhatsApp.
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is traveling and violating Israeli protocols and US protocols and putting himself and his team at risk in order to deliver a message that is probably about the annexation.
 I would venture to say that the message is an extension of an earlier message sent after Israel declared its intention to annex and the White House agreed, but then asked Israel to slow that process down. Pompeo will probably say that the White House agrees with annexation but that this is a tumultuous time.
 Whether I am correct on the messaging or not, there is no doubt that the reason for the visit is the delivery of a personal message. And like hand- shaking and travel, that is the role of a secretary of state.

The Thousand Oaks-based facility said it would return to its original name of Sports Academy. It was founded in 2016. Bryant, who spent 20 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers and helped the franchise win five NBA championships, joined in 2018.                                                                          Games were being played at the academy when the news broke of Bryant's death. Players immediately stopped and many people in the gym burst into tears when told Bryant was aboard the helicopter that crashed.                                                                          The academy is under consideration as a home base for an NBA minor league program that will provide one year of preparation, on and off the court, for some elite players who choose to bypass college but are not yet eligible for the NBA draft.                                                                          Bryant is the only NBA player to have his team retire two numbers in his honor. He was selected last month for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. A ceremony is scheduled for late August though it may be delayed until at least October because of the coronavirus pandemic.                                                                          Bryant’s production company, Granity Studios, has remained active since his death. The latest children’s book released by Bryant’s company last month — "The Wizenard Series: Season One” — became his fifth book to reach No. 1 on The New York Times’ best-seller lists.                                                                          The helicopter crash remains under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.                                                                          In February, Bryant’s widow, Vanessa Bryant, sued the estate of pilot Ara Zobayan and the charter company that owned the helicopter, Island Express. She claimed Zobayan failed "to use ordinary care in piloting the subject aircraft” and alleged negligence.                                                                          On Friday, Zobayan’s brother, Berge Zobayan, said in a court filing that Kobe Bryant knew the risks of helicopter flying and his survivors aren’t entitled to damages from the pilot’s estate, t he Los Angeles Times reported.                                                                          Island Express responded in court papers Monday saying they are not responsible for damages, calling the crash, among other things, "an act of God" and "an unavoidable accident" that was beyond their control. The charter company also said the Bryants knew of the risks and dangers of flying in a helicopter and "voluntarily assume(d) the risk of the accident, injury, and damages" when they got on the chopper.                                                                          Vanessa Bryant separately last week filed a claim — a precursor to a lawsuit — against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department after deputies were accused of sharing unauthorized photos of the crash site. The claim was first reported by PEOPLE; the investigation into the deputies’ photos was initially published by the Times. The sheriff has declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation                                                                          The survivors of crash victims Sarah Chester and her daughter Payton filed a complaint Monday against the helicopter company and the pilot's estate. Families of other victims previously filed lawsuits.

Can technology really save us, as Hwang suggested, by spawning reliable detection tools? As an initial matter, we disagree with the claim that detection tools inevitably will win the day in this cat-and-mouse game. We certainly are not there yet with respect to detection of deepfakes that are created with generative adversarial networks, and it is not clear that we should be optimistic about reaching that point. Decades of experience with the arms races involving spam, malware, viruses and photo fakery have taught us that playing defense is difficult and that adversaries can be highly motivated and innovative, constantly finding ways to penetrate defenses. Even if capable detection technologies emerge, moreover, it is not assured that they will prove scaleable, diffusible and affordable to the extent needed to have a dramatic impact on the deepfake threat.

Even prior to the outbreak in Seoul’s gay bars, a positive coronavirus diagnosis carried deep stigma in South Korea. In a survey conducted by Seoul National University’s School of Public Health, 62 percent of people reported they were more afraid of the social consequences of getting the virus than they were of the potential health risks. Recently, South Korean health officials have met with gay rights groups in the country to discuss the homophobic attacks. They’ve promised that anyone who may have been in the clubs from April 26 to May 6 can get tested anonymously, no questions asked.                                                  "The virus outbreak is bringing up many social issues that have been unresolved in South Korea for a long time,” said Ki Moran, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Center. "Homosexuality is one of them, and public disapproval is now testing the nation’s ability to get those who fear that stigma to be tested.”                                                  People have lots of reasons for wanting to remain anonymous. The Malaysian government has detained hundreds of undocumented immigrants and imposed stricter restrictions in areas that are home to mostly foreigners. The crackdown has also affected the 180,000 people recognized as refugees by the United Nations, though not by Malaysia, which isn’t a party to international refugee agreements.                                                  The news of mass arrests in early May was "counter-productive and clearly a step backward in the ongoing public health response to the pandemic,” the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia said in a May 3 statement. "As a consequence, one can expect these vulnerable people will be less willing to come forward for any tests or medical treatment, regardless of the argument or persuasion for them to do so.”                                                  Others fear vicious personal attacks. Varun Vig found himself a target within hours of landing in New Delhi on March 22. After the New York-based graphic designer arrived at the empty suburban apartment he’d chosen for his mandatory home quarantine, neighborhood chat groups began reporting the surreptitious arrival of a coronavirus-positive "patient.”                                                  That was the first thing the nosy neighbors got wrong — Vig didn’t have the virus — but it wasn’t the last. They said he’d escaped from virus-ridden Rome with his infected Italian girlfriend. He’d reportedly evicted his grandparents to take refuge in their home. Maintenance staff soon refused to clear his "contaminated” trash and police came knocking.                                                  "I want to spend these 14 days in peace, not being harassed by cops, not being harassed by security guards and by other building residents,” the 23-year-old pleaded in an Instagram video post.                                                  Still others have more pedestrian reasons for wanting to maintain their privacy. In Gifu, at least 30 infections were eventually traced to one of the city’s hostess clubs. While such clubs, where female employees flirt with and entertain the mostly male clientele, are entirely legal, discretion is part of their business model. Customers — and employees — may not be known by their real names.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted decision of over 48 per cent Indian students who wanted to study abroad, according to a report by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), which comes out with coveted global ranking for educational institutions.                                                                                                  The significantly lower return of investment in an already expensive international higher education domain coupled with further reduced chances of employability in the post COVID-19 world have a key role to play in this shift, experts at QS have pointed out.                                                                                                  The report titled "Indian Student's Mobility report 2020: Impact of COVID-19 on Higher Education Choices" has been compiled by QS IGAUGE, which rates colleges and universities in India with complete operational control held by London-based QS.   "Our findings suggest that COVID-19 has impacted the decision of 48.46 pc students who aspired to study abroad in the recent past. However, there is a larger proportion of non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) students who have reconsidered their decision to pursue higher education outside India," it said.                                                                                                  "The significantly lower return of investment in an already expensive international higher education domain coupled with further reduced chances of employability in the post COVID-19 world have a key role to play in this shift.    "While there is likely to be a demand for STEM based professionals, it might not be the same for non-STEM courses which resonates with the higher percentage of students in the latter category to reconsider their higher education plans," it added.                                                                                                   According to the report, while higher education institutions might adapt sooner or later to the e-learning practices, it might take a relatively longer time to come to terms with the drastic changes in the student mobility for higher education.                                                                                                   "It is no longer a mystery that global travel is a key factor in the spread of communicable disease. The repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to produce pronounced changes in teaching and learning practices for all levels of education.                                                                                                   "This had led to debates and deliberations on student mobility in times to come. Various findings have come out highlighting the challenges the higher education community is likely to face in the international context. Our study contextualises the issue of student mobility for Indian students both within the country and abroad through data driven research," it said.                                                                                                   The report has also highlighted that while the magnitude of change will be exponential for international student mobility, there is likely to be some impact on Indian students' inter-state mobility as well.                                                                                                   More than 4.2 million cases of COVID-19 have been recorded worldwide, including at least 289,000 deaths. The deadly virus has brought several countries to a standstill with many of them imposing international travel restrictions.
