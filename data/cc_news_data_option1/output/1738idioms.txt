Beyond that, he added, there also could be more voters requesting mail ballots because they’re concerned about voting in-person during the pandemic.
 A limited or defunct USPS has the potential of leaving millions of voters in a lurch, according to elections experts and voting advocates.
 Mindy Romero is the executive director of the California Civic Engagement Project, a nonpartisan civic engagement research center based in Sacramento. She said the postal service has always been essential to elections in the U.S and its role was expected to expand in November in light of the pandemic, she said.
 Election officials already were trying to figure out how to safely offer in- person voting in November, she said; now added challenges for USPS would complicate mail ballot voting as well.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - The coronavirus pandemic has left a big question mark over colleges and universities and how many students will return to campus, or if campuses will re-open for the fall semester.Colleges and universities need money from students’ tuition and fees, but they also need to make sure everyone is safe when they return.“The number one thing that’s impacting every decision-maker is health and how do we make sure that everything we do puts that as priority number one,” said Gordon Stone, Executive Director of Alabama’s Higher Education Partnership. “Number two, how do we make sure that the learning experience is maximized for our young people because that’s why they’re choosing to attend our institutions."Stone says the third priority is to make sure employees have a vital role, not just on campuses, when it comes to instruction but also a role in our state.Students everywhere are reconsidering their options in light of COVID-19. Eleven percent of students who were surveyed by Strada Education Network said they canceled their college plans because of the coronavirus outbreak, and 40-percent still haven’t submitted a deposit to any school signaling a commitment to attend in the fall. Those numbers play a huge role in how colleges and universities plan and pay for the next semester.“The trends nationally that we’ve seen that have impacted us over the last decade have been a reduced amount of revenue that comes from public sources. In Alabama, we’ve seen our operations and maintenance funds which is basically what runs the institution, those funds which were predominantly state-funded for public universities, shift a lot to tuition and fees,” Stone explained. “When you seen that shift, then you have a concern that enrollment could go down, you have to understand that doesn’t change the marketplace, we’re still graduating young people from high school. Universities still want to meet that demand.”According to another survey by higher ed consulting firm Simpson Scarborough, as many as 20-percent of students who had been planning to start college in the fall may not actually attend. The main reason, diminished family finances. “All of our institutions have been willing to work with the families and with prospective students to try to try to make this decision as easy as possible, and recognizing that there’s a lot of unknown, even day by day at this point,” said Stone. “So, first and foremost, knowing there’s a willingness to work with you at every campus. number two, stay in touch with the people that have been your contacts. All of them are still working and they’re still available, so try to make sure you talk through your circumstances with your recruiter or your admissions counselor."Stone says they encourage students to talk to your institution and find out what you need to do.“They will work with you,” Stone added.Most schools would have required students to accept their admissions offers by May 1. This pandemic has forced many colleges to push that deadline back to June 1, giving families a little more time to figure out their finances and make this decision. “We encourage people don’t give up on your dream, don’t back away from your pursuit. If you feel like this fall I’m uncertain about what to do, explore what that institution has ways to stay enrolled, to continue to be a part of that institutional environment."Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News.

As Kolkata Knight Riders and Gujarat Lions boarded a flight from Rajkot on Saturday afternoon, it wasn’t surprising to see the Knight Riders were the chirpier lot.


  While the pall of Chris Lynn and Gautam Gambhir’s onslaught didn’t make it a memorable journey towards Hyderabad for Lions, Knight Riders revelled in their openers’ record-breaking display.


  Lynn, the king of Friday night, preferred to rest along with most of his overseas journeymen during the hour-long flight, even as captain Gautam Gambhir joined the younger group in a game of cards.


  While the game of blackjack had to be abruptly halted with the descend towards Mumbai, Gambhir’s gunners will look to continue their near-perfect start to their IPL campaign against Mumbai Indians on Sunday night.


  The spinners came good and the calculated gamble of promoting to Lynn to the top of the batting order worked wonders.


  The coaching staff — consisting of head coach Jacques Kallis, assistant coaches Simon Katich and L. Balaji and performance analyst A.R. Srikkanth — suggested the move was wholeheartedly backed by Gambhir.


  If Lynn and Gambhir continue their antics at Wankhede, Mumbai Indians would be hard-pressed to open its points tally.Rohit Sharma’s boys had a reason to rejoice and an injury concern ahead of the game.


  The Sri Lankan duo of veteran Lasith Malinga and newbie Asela Gunaratne have joined the squad after finishing their national duties.


  ##


  Malinga boost


  Malinga’s presence will boost the MI’s prospects of death bowling, which eventually resulted in its nail-biting loss in Pune.


  It would be interesting to see if Mumbai Indians draft Malinga into the eleven straightaway. If coach Mahela Jayawardene opts for it, it may result in Kiwi Tim Southee being benched after an expensive spell in the first match.


  The onus will be on Rohit to hold the innings together. He could hardly contribute to his team’s cause with the bat on his return to top-flight cricket after a prolonged injury layoff. He couldn’t ask for a better stage to explode with the willow and make it a happy weekend for the MI Paltan.

WASHINGTON — U.S. officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak — and how contagious the disease is — to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.
 Chinese leaders “intentionally concealed the severity” of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.
 The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government’s response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump’s political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.
 Not classified but marked “for official use only,” the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by “denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data,” the analysis states.
 The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus “was a contagion” for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad — and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.
 Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China’s changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report.
 China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on Jan. 8.
 Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government’s missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information and officials hesitant to report bad news. There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world’s medical supplies.
 In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame U.S. intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.
 “Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S.,” Trump wrote without citing specifics. “Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.”
 Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible “mistake.” His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.
 Speaking Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, “Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories.”
 “These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab,” Pompeo said. “And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”
 The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.
 Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn’t human-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.
 Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on U.S. accusations that the outbreak was China’s fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak. China’s public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the U.S. nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the U.S. government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.
 “The U.S. government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic,” Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

Wearing masks in public will likely become the norm for a while, as our society copes warily with the virus threat. It’s a necessary, sensible step recommended now by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vice President Mike Pence set the right example on Thursday by wearing a mask in visiting a GM plant in Indiana. That was a welcome turnaround from Pence’s decision to go mask-free Tuesday when he visited one of the nation’s pre- eminent medical centers, the Mayo Clinic.
 Health authorities offer various recommendations for mask usage: Keep the mask tight enough to provide a good seal. Use them no more than three or four hours at a time, then wash them in hot water and dry them thoroughly before the next use. Wash hands for 20 seconds before putting on a mask and after taking it off. Don’t touch the outside of the mask while wearing it or touch your face under the mask.
 Health officials note, too, that masks don’t replace the good hygiene procedures now so familiar — social distancing and proper hand washing, for example. All these steps, masks included, are part of a regimen we all should now be following, to protect ourselves and our communities.

El portal inmobiliario Lamudi reporta durante marzo y abril una intención de compra de 80 por ciento y de renta de 75 por ciento.


  Se trata de gente que no sólo busca, sino que encuentra una propiedad que le gusta y deja datos para ser contactada, lo que podría detonar el sector una vez que pase la contingencia sanitaria, comentó Daniel Narváez.


  “Se espera una clara recuperación del sector en el segundo cuatrimestre. La gente tiene más tiempo de exposición a canales digitales y eso nos da como referencia una mayor intención de compra”, comentó el especialista.


  Este repunte podría ocurrir incluso con la fuerte caída en el empleo, con la pérdida de más un millón de fuentes de trabajo, que se espera debido a la crisis sanitaria por el coronavirus.


  La razón, coincidieron, será la baja en las tasas de interés por parte del Banxico que, recientemente, la recortó en 50 puntos base para dejarla en seis por ciento.


  Con este nivel de tasas, el sector inmobiliario podría librar lo ocurrido en la crisis de 2009, cuando por el brote de influenza AH1N1 la venta de casas disminuyó casi dos por ciento a tasa anual.

Glenn Maxwell proved the maximum player for his team at the Holkar Stadium here on Saturday.
 He read the flow of the game superbly and then delivered the decisive blows with the bat. As skipper, he made all the right moves for Kings XI Punjab.
 In the first half of the game, Maxwell opted to chase, rung in the bowling changes capably, and smartly had a left-arm spinner operating when M.S. Dhoni batted.
 In the chase, Maxwell cleverly held himself and David Miller back, promoted Axar Patel, and got some handy runs from him.
 When it really mattered, he and Miller launched into the Rising Pune Supergiant attack. The explosive right-left combination powered Kings XI home.
 Maxwell, the quintessential impact player, shone bright under evening floodlights with his unbeaten 20-ball 44.
 Pursuing 164 on a surface with some grass and bounce, Kings XI defeated the strong Supergiant by six wickets in this engaging IPL game.
 There was only one way the match was going to end when Maxwell rocked back to pull Imran Tahir for a six over mid-wicket and then dismissed the next ball in the same direction over the ropes.
 Maxwell versus leg-spinner Tahir was a key duel within the larger battle and the Aussie clinched it. Indeed, Kings XI and Maxwell won the key moments.
 Maxwell tactically upstaged his Australia skipper Steve Smith. When Maxwell and Miller (30 not out) cut loose, Smith appeared to run out of ideas. Tahir had appeared threatening, foxing Wriddhiman Saha with a googly and setting out on his war dance.
 Then, Maxwell and Miller took the game away from Smith and Supergiant.
 Earlier, Mayank Agarwal was done in by an in-swinger from Sandeep Sharma, who bowled wicket-to-wicket and altered his pace.
 The nippy left-armer T. Natarajan, living a dream, made an immediate impression on his IPL debut, taking out Ajinkya Rahane with a delivery outside off.
 Smith appeared in ominous touch — a straight drive screamed past Natarajan — before being held at deep square-leg off Stoinis.
 M.S. Dhoni, caught in two minds, knocked back a flighted one from Swapnil Singh. Dhoni has had his share of troubles against left-arm spin. Ben Stokes (50) and Manoj Tiwary (40 not out) launched a counter-attack. Stokes, his back-lift flourishing, bludgeoned a few stunning blows. Tiwary, with his quick hands and bat-speed, thumped a few through the gaps. It seemed a combative score but Kings XI and Maxwell put their foot on the accelerator in the final stretch.

The heart of the problem is that local news, in particular, has been severely disrupted by a broader restructuring of the economy over the past two decades. Historically, advertising sustained serious journalism. As New York University’s Clay Shirky pointed out in a 2009 commentary, Walmart may or may not have had an interest in the news from Iraq, but it was nonetheless subsidizing newspapers’ Baghdad bureaus.
 When digital platforms like Google and Facebook started hoovering up the advertising revenues that previously went directly to news organizations, local outlets were the first to feel the pinch. Newsroom staff was cut dramatically. According to a recent Brookings Institution report, one in five local U.S. newspapers has disappeared since 2004, leaving 5 million Americans with no local newspaper at all, and 60 million more with access to only one.
 The growth of such “news deserts” has had profound political effects. When there are no journalists to report on town council meetings and public procurement decisions, corruption can run rampant. But partly because no one hears about it, political interest also declines. Hence, the shuttering of local papers has been associated with lower electoral turnout, fewer candidates seeking office and more incumbents winning. The same trends undercut citizens’ representation at the national level, because local and regional papers cannot afford to keep a correspondent in the capital to report on what their members of Congress or Parliament are doing.
 Less obviously, the decline of local news has reinforced the pernicious polarization that we are witnessing in a number of democracies. When it comes to local issues, citizens within the same community or neighborhood are generally pretty good about diagnosing problems and arriving at practical solutions to them. But as local reporting has dried up, the vacuum has been filled by national news, which tends to be geared toward zero-sum culture wars and partisan flame-throwing.
 In Hungary, Turkey and other countries where democracy and the rule of law are being systematically dismantled, some relatively independent national newspapers and websites have survived. But, perversely, such institutions can become a fig leaf for regimes facing international criticism for their attacks on press freedom, while pro-regime outlets often enjoy a monopoly at the local level. In rural Hungary, the situation has gotten so bad that the U.S. Department of State has sought to subsidize independent reporting there.
 Finally, the fate of local newspapers does not necessarily run in parallel with that of the national press. In the United States, the major “papers of record” have benefited from a “Trump bump” since 2016. And while the COVID-19 crisis could, in theory, make citizens recognize the existential importance of receiving accurate information about their immediate surroundings, a local news bump has yet to materialize.
 What can be done? One solution is to tax the Big Tech companies that have destroyed the local-news business model, then redistribute the funds to local outlets. Another option is to legislate an antitrust exception so that newspapers can bargain collectively with digital platforms. The media outlets providing the actual facts and information that show up in a Google search should be compensated accordingly. Australia, the European Union and several individual European countries have already moved in this direction, and similar legislation is pending in the U.S.
 There has also been a blossoming of successful nonprofit news organizations in recent years, many of which have a local focus. But the risk now is that such institutions could become dependent on some billionaire philanthropist, leaving them beholden to one person’s arbitrary will. The French social scientist Julia Cage has proposed an ingenious solution: ordinary supporters of accurate reporting could pool their resources to secure controlling shares of the most effective media nonprofits.
 It can be fine for such nonprofits to have an agenda. After all, just as with political parties, supporters join organizations because the latter reflect their values in some ways. Having an agenda — such as investigating social injustices — is compatible with a commitment to the highest journalistic standards. What matters is accuracy, (ideally) accessibility and accountability. As philosopher Onora O’Neill explains, truth-seeking media “needs internal disciplines and standards to make it assessable.” Audiences should be in a position to understand who funds an outlet, what guides its editorial decisions and how particular stories are generated.
 The problem with many right-wing outlets today is not necessarily that they have an agenda, but that the agenda is hidden, with mere opinion being presented as professionally generated news. A particularly egregious example is Fox News, which earlier this spring eagerly spread dangerous disinformation about the coronavirus, probably costing the lives of some of its predominantly elderly audience.
 The COVID-19 crisis has reminded us that journalists are essential workers. Many national media outlets will probably survive (indeed, some are already benefiting from governments’ spending on emergency relief). But local journalism was already in bad shape before the crisis, and the public good it provides tends to be less appreciated. For the sake of our physical health and that of our democracies, we urgently must support it.

 The consequences: lasting organ damage, or neurological setbacks for those experiencing strokes, or worsening chronic diseases such as diabetes.
 It is clear that what medical professionals are observing on a case-by-case basis is part of a larger trend visible in county data, which show that the total number of daily emergency visits for all local hospitals since mid- March, when stay-at-home orders took effect, has dropped 40 percent on average when compared to rates for the same time frame last year.
 Though it is unclear exactly how many are paying the price, a recent spike in death-related emergency calls in San Diego County, despite the overall death rate appearing to hold steady, suggests that the individual reports emerging from the front lines, not just in San Diego but nationwide, are important warning signs that people are delaying needed medical care during the pandemic.

 # Ari Lennox Talks Lacking Individuality In Music: “I Have To Live A Lie Because People Are Judgemental”

CHICAGO — When Jesse Smith looks out at his Zoom audience, he knows exactly what the crowd is going through.
 The captain of the U.S. men’s water polo team is adjusting his training, too. He also misses playing alongside his friends.
 One way Smith is dealing with the coronavirus pandemic is through virtual speaking engagements with water polo clubs and teams all over the country, passing along what he has learned during a couple decades in the water.
 The 37-year-old Smith is one of several Olympic athletes who have been using digital avenues to help their sport during the shutdown. While Zoom sessions are a frequent choice, some athletes are offering training tips on Instagram and Olympic federations are pitching in with newsletters and other web-based help.
 “We're all as athletes affected the same way,” Smith said. “Even though I'm a four-time Olympian, a silver medal (winner), training for my fifth Olympics, the captain of my team, the same thing is going on in my head as a 16-year-old that got their (season) canceled, and I think that I have more tools available, so I'm trying to share that."
 Beach volleyball star Kerri Walsh Jennings has been doing online talks with young volleyball players, including one with the team at her alma mater of Archbishop Mitty High School in California. U.S. wrestlers Mallory Velte, Pat Smith and Yianni Diakomihalis detailed their at-home workouts in a post on the federation website. Casey Patterson and April Ross were among a group of beach volleyball players who shared workout tips during Facebook live sessions on the AVP page.
 The federations also are reaching out. USA Water Polo has been sending out a weekly newsletter called “At Home with USA Water Polo” featuring interviews with coaches and athletes. U.S. Rowing has been holding webinars for its members. USA Volleyball has a page on its website with COVID-19-related resources.
 “A lot of people look to (us) in the athlete world, in our communities, for us to kind of be a voice. Like, how are we going to respond? What actions are we taking?” said U.S. softball pitcher Monica Abbott, who has been doing speaking engagements with young softball players and holding pitching-inspired workout sessions.
 The effort by Olympic athletes and federations comes amid concern about the future of college sports. Some Olympic sports could be on the chopping block for athletic departments looking to save money after losing revenue due to the COVID-19 shutdown.
 “I wouldn't say that that's something I'm focusing on, but it's definitely something that's in my mind and helps me plan for these,” U.S. water polo center Matt Farmer said, “because I'm taking an optimistic view of what's going to happen in college water polo, because it means so much to so many people.”
 Farmer, a 24-year-old Chicago native who played on three NCAA championship teams at UCLA, is focusing his outreach efforts on the Midwest. California is the home of American water polo, but Farmer is hoping he can help some young players follow in his footsteps.
 “I kind of blazed a trail from Chicago to international water polo,” Farmer said, “and I want to share my experiences with people and maybe give advice to people who are thinking about playing in college or continuing the sport and just want to grow as players and as people.”
 The online conversations usually touch on a variety of topics. There are the usual practical tips for playing the sport at a high level, but there also are elements of sports psychology — especially with young players away from their teams and searching for motivation.
 Walsh Jennings, a three-time Gold medalist, said the calls have become a highlight of her day.
 “We're all feeling the same frustrations and longings,” she said. “It's pretty special to be able to speak to the fact that we're not alone in this and that it is up to each of us to make the best of what we have to work with — to focus on that which we can control.”

TOPEKA -- Kansas Democrats, who participated in unprecedented numbers in the party's presidential primary, overwhelmingly selected Joe Biden as their choice for president.
   
 Biden already was the party's presumptive nominee when voting began in Kansas. The former vice president won 76.9% of 146,873 votes, leaving 23.1% for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in the final tally of a new ranked-choice system for the state party.
   
 The change from a caucus format and an aggressive push for mail-in ballots while the state was on lockdown for COVID-19 led to a dramatic increase in turnout for the party, which typically sees 8% to 10% participation in presidential primaries. Four years ago, the total turnout was 39,230.
   
 This year, the vote total more than tripled as 34.7% of registered Kansas Democrats participated.
   
 "The KDP offers its congratulations to former Vice President Joseph Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders for receiving delegates from the Sunflower State," said party chairwoman Vicki Hiatt. "Kansas Democrats made history in this election with record participation levels along with demonstrating how a vote-by-mail election can protect voters and our democracy, even in the most uncertain of times. We are confident the enthusiasm and engagement seen during the 2020 Primary will only continue to grow and translate into Democratic victories up and down the ballot in November."
   
 Biden won 69% of votes in the first round of a ranked choice system. The candidate receiving the least votes is eliminated every round, with those votes going to the next choice on the ballot. Sanders won 18%, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren getting 8% and 1% going to Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. About 3% declined to commit to a top choice.
   
 Gabbard, uncommitted and Warren votes were redistributed over the course of three additional rounds.
   
 "The Kansas Democratic Party will carry this record-breaking momentum into our robust coordinated campaign to elect Democrats who will fight for working families, health care reform and a future we all can be proud of in November," said Ben Meers, the party's executive director.
   
 District-level party officials will select delegates for the national convention later this month, and additional delegates will be chosen by party officials during the first week of June.

MILWAUKEE — It’s Saturday night at Odd Duck, a popular restaurant in Milwaukee’s trendy Bay View neighborhood.
 The kitchen is packed with chefs and managers preparing carry-out orders.
 But the dining room has been empty since the state ordered all Wisconsin restaurants and bars closed on March 17 to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
 Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and the state Department of Health Services says these measures are working. But for many, COVID-19 is having more of an effect on their financial well-being than their health.
 One in four Americans have lost their job or income due to the pandemic. And perhaps no industry has been hit harder than restaurants and bars.
 The Wisconsin Restaurant Association says at least half of state’s establishments have shut their doors completely during the pandemic. Others, like Odd Duck, began offering carry-out services.
 Melissa Bucholz, the owner of Odd Duck, said making the transition to carry out was hard, because the restaurant had never offered it before.
 “We literally didn’t have bags or to-go boxes, we had to re-write the whole menu for something that would work for carry-out,” Bucholz told Wisconsin Public Radio.
 Business at Odd Duck is down 70%, but for now, they’re holding on. The restaurant normally has 36 employees. Now, they’ve got 14 employees. They self-isolate, to stay healthy and keep the restaurant running.
 “It literally feels like you are a failure every day, but you have to tell yourself it’s a win; considering the circumstances,” Bucholz said during a virtual event hosted by Opportunity Wisconsin.
 Odd Duck has created a pantry to feed its workers. And tips the working employees are given are donated to those who have been laid off from the restaurant.
 Bucholz considers herself lucky. The restaurant has been in business for eight years. It is established, has good cash flow and is out of debt.
 “If this had happened in year two of business, we would not be standing at this point,” she said.
 Kristine Hillmer, president and CEO of the Wisconsin Restaurant Association, said even restaurants that are open for carry-out have seen a reduction in revenue between 50 and 70%. And when the pandemic ends, as many as half of the state’s restaurants could permanently close.
 “Some have just decided to close their doors right now, and focus on reopening,” Hillmer said. “The longer this goes, the less likely that is going to be.”
 Some restaurants tried to convert to carry-out but stopped after a few weeks. That’s what happened at Bounce Milwaukee, a restaurant and inflatable sports arena.
 Becky Cooper Clancy, the owner of Bounce, said March is usually the restaurant’s busiest month. This year, sales were down 80%.
 “It just completely knocked the wind out of us,” Clancy said. “We had to make decisions basically where we were deciding basically what’s good for the business or what’s good for the employee. And it’s really needed to prioritize taking care of our employees.”
 A small staff briefly remained for carry-out orders. But now most employees have been furloughed, given severance packages and promised jobs when the economy is better.
 Tony Marquez, owner of La Estacion in Waukesha, says he doesn’t know how he’s going to pay for the restaurant or his personal bills. Often, he doesn’t sleep at night.
 He’s currently keeping his restaurant open for carry-out in an attempt to survive.
 “We didn’t create this,” Marquez said. “We were working, running our business. Next thing we know the carpet is moved from our feet and we are left out to sea. If you can swim, swim. If you can’t, you can’t.”
 In early April, small businesses could begin applying for loans and grants contained in the $2 trillion federal stimulus package known as the CARES Act.
 But the restaurant association’s Hillmer said there are still a lot of unknowns and likely many restaurants won’t be open in time to take advantage of the federal programs.
 Some of the uncertainty lies in the fact that qualifying for the federal programs depends on business’ ability to have workers back by June — which wont be the case for many restaurants.
 Bucholz said owners need clear guidance, bridge loans and financial support for their staff.
 “We are really busy trying to save our businesses,” Bucholz said. “We don’t have time to slog through millions of miles of paperwork and websites. We just need to know what to do to get through this so we can get back on our feet and come through this so we can come out the other side and be stronger than ever in summer.”

USA Football is launching an app that can help coaches and parents on all youth levels of the sport.
 At a key time, too, with so many youngsters across the nation unable to gather for any games or practices — now or for who knows how long?
 The free app, called Coach Planner by USA Football, was built by the governing body of the sport as part of the Football Development Model that aligns with the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee’s American Development Model. The FDM is designed to aid in the progression of the whole athlete based on a child’s age and stage of development.
 Coaches, who are often parents of the players, teach athletes based on their age, skill level and the version of the sport that they prefer, from flag football to 11-player tackle and game types in between. More than 100 football drills and 12 prescribed practice plans are loaded on the app, with more to come.
 “If we plan something, it has to be scaleable and global,” said Michael Krueger, USA Football’s senior director of football education. “With technical skill progressions, it helps provide context for the developmental stage of the athlete and for their coaching. A 7-year old is at a way different stage than a 12-year old. The neatest thing about the app is it helps provide that kind of resource and support in the space where we may not have coaches with extensive background. Their knowledge could be extensive or limited. The resources here run the gamut.”
 For example, if coaches have been involved in the sport for a decade or more, reinforcement of their techniques is available on the app. But if the coaches are newcomers or relatively inexperienced, there are programs available for them as well.
 “It does speak to the differences in coaches,” Krueger says, “their approaches and backgrounds, and it’s built on the expertise within the sport.”
 The app took a bit over a year to develop; Football Canada already had one for its youth organizations and provided some guidance to its neighbors in the states. USA Football has nearly 900 youth clubs and leagues already enrolled in the development model, and the app can provide the coaching services currently not available because of the shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 It includes six categories for player development: athletic foundations; passing; running and receiving; kicking and punting; preparation for contact; flag pulling and tackling.
 “We have to take the reality of the situation, and the app is a great example of touch points,” Krueger explained. “How can we be a resource with kids at home? We have taken on that challenge.”
 Critical to the success of the FDM are such touch points as ensuring that playbooks and drills are easily usable, and for coaches to connect with their teams and players’ parents. to connect. Through the app, they can share all the content needed to teach the sport.
 “We want to make sure this really addresses the things parents could do with their kids at home while in shelter,” added Jamie Riley, USA Football’s chief of staff. “When this rolls out, they can take it and run with it at home.
 “As a mom, I can attest to the importance of making sure parents understand and are involved in what their child learns on the field and the Coach Planner app helps them get there. We know nothing is as effective as in-person and face-to-face (learning), yet the app is a great bridge to that."

It sounds like you are kind of thinking that the trajectory into the current quarter has a wide dispersion and hence you can't forecast it.

Russia has spent more than a decade rebuilding its navy, which deteriorated after the Cold War, though it remains smaller than its Soviet predecessor.


  Adm. James Foggo, head of US Naval Forces Europe-Africa, has warned repeatedly about Russia's increasing naval activity, describing rising tension at sea as the "fourth battle of the Atlantic," after the world wars and the Cold War.


  Foggo, a submarine officer by training, has pointed to increasingly sophisticated Russian submarines as a concern, citing their new ability to launch missiles as a potential threat to European cities and infrastructure.


  "The Russians are operating first-rate submarines, but let there be no doubt ... we still have the competitive advantage in the undersea domain," Foggo said at the US Naval Institute's annual meeting on April 30.

Opinion is divided among agriculturists and experts whether all categories of farmers require farm a loan waiver.


  This assumes relevance in the light of the Madras High Court’s recent direction to the State government to extend waiver of cooperative loans to all farmers, irrespective of the size of landholding.


  Last year, the government waived loans of about 16. 9 lakh small and marginal farmers to the tune of ₹ 5,780 crore. If it chooses to extend the scheme to other farmers, it would cost ₹ 1,980.33 crore more and benefit around 3 lakh farmers, according to the Court’s order.


  P.Ayyakannu, State president of the National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Association, and who had moved the High Court against the government scheme of providing the waiver to small and marginal farmers, emphasises that drought and floods affect farmers, big or small, equally. So, there is no justification for making the distinction between the two. The crux of the problem is the lack of remunerative returns.


  “If the Central and State governments come forward to implement the key recommendation of the M S Swaminathan Commission that the minimum support price be set at the cost of cultivation plus 50% of the cost, we do not require any subsidy or debt waiver.”


  ##


  Risky venture


  Describing agriculture as the “risky venture,” S. Ranganathan, general secretary of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, points out that government assistance should be given to all those whose primary source of income is agriculture, regardless of the size of landholding.


  But, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam president K. Balakrishnan wonders how big farmers can be equated with small and marginal farmers. The underlying principle behind welfare schemes of the government is to ameliorate the conditions of downtrodden. “If the distinction between small and marginal farmers and big farmers is questioned, one can also question the rationale behind the classification of below poverty line (BPL). One can also challenge the economic criterion fixed for students’ scholarship schemes,” Mr Balakrishnan, former legislator from Chidambaram, says. The basis of the classification can be amended to cover more deserving farmers but the classification has to be done, he adds.


  R. Kannan, former civil servant and author of many publications on agriculture and cooperative sector, says there is nothing new about the categorisation of farmers and this has been in vogue for over 50 years. Invariably, when any scheme on loan waiver is framed, farmers who have repaid their dues are left out and defaulters get rewarded. This would only encourage indiscipline among borrowers (farmers).

At times, Flynn’s book has an off the cuff feel, inevitable given that the author is setting out ‘a pre-theory concept of intelligence.’ Whilst it is the case that the air of considered extemporaneity is part of the book’s charm, it also reveals its shortcomings. By the end we are into the realm of conjecture and contention. The last couple of chapters are rushed and slight on substance; ideas are suggested, picked up and dropped, only to be taken up a few pages later. It all begins to resemble something of an impassioned ramble, in marked contrast to the self-assured and efficient tone at the outset. That is not to say that I did not learn much, which, to someone outside of a professional interest in this subject, is the primary reason for reading. However, I was still left feeling dissatisfied. Near the end of the book, Flynn says that ‘(he) cannot say (he) enjoyed the task of trying to make sense of massive IQ gains over time.’ I cannot say that I always enjoyed reading the fruits of his labour either.

Company executive director Lori Butler said the company hosted a virtual “State of the Arts in Oceanside” forum on March 20, followed by an online playreading April 2 of Casey Tibbitts’ play “Quiet Cross,” which was co- produced by Scripps Ranch Theatre.
 Butler said 120 people logged in for the Zoom-based performance, which was unfortunately Zoombombed by a hacker. Ultimately, the company was able to provide a recorded version of the play-reading via email to all ticket- holders.
 The company has launched a fundraising campaign called OTC First Responders. Many “Sweet Charity” ticket-holders donated back to the company the value of their tickets rather than ask for a refund. And community members also stepped up to offer donations. Over the three-week period in March and early April, OTC raised $16,000 in donations from more than 100 donors.
 Next up for OTC, Butler said the company is raising $32,000 to produce online plays, music and art performances. Since the company’s youth theater camp has been canceled, the company is also considering hosting online youth theater workshops this summer.
 “The support of local art lovers now and for the future that includes a complete renovation of the Brooks is critical to maintaining our spot as the center point of the Oceanside Cultural District and a state of the art venue for performing arts in San Diego County,” Butler said.

 Fears of contracting the disease have been exacerbated by periodic shortages of masks, hand sanitizer and other protective gear at Metro’s bus yards, and a lack of hazard pay, drivers said.
 “If I come to work, am I going to catch it today? Will I catch it tomorrow? Will I catch it next week?” said a driver from a bus yard in Boyle Heights. “It’s always in the back of my head.”

 Political mailers and pamphlets also are a favorite of campaigns at the local, state and federal level, and they, too, reach voters through the postal service.
 In light of the coronavirus pandemic, election officials throughout California and the country were expecting USPS to play an outsized role in the November election.

Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi on Saturday left for New Delhi after she was called up to the Capital in the middle of the tour of Karaikal.


  Her sudden trip to Delhi assumes significance amid a meltdown in ties between the Raj Nivas and the Congress government in Puducherry.


  The ties between Ms. Bedi and the government have hit rock bottom after the Puducherry Municipal Commissioner, considered her confidant, was removed and put on compulsory wait by Speaker V. Vaithilingam until the Assembly Privileges Committee disposed of a complaint raised against the official by AIADMK (Amma) MLA A. Baskar.


  In spite of missives from the Lt. Governor, who was away at that time, the Chief Secretary in order to avoid contempt of the House, had issued an order giving additional charge of the municipality to S. Ganessin.


  When on Monday, Mr. Chandirasekaran, on the instructions of Ms. Bedi reported for duty at the Municipality office, he had to retreat after the Government appointee assumed charge with police protection ordered by the Speaker. Mr. Chandirasekaran was left facing another charge of contempt for disobeying the Speaker’s transfer ruling.


  The Privileges Committee also summoned Secretary to the Lieutenant Governor G. Theva Neethi Dhas to reply to the proceedings of the contempt of the house before April 19 on charges of “abetting R. Chandirasekaran to act as the Commissioner of Pondicherry Municipality against a ruling given by the Speaker.”


  Ms. Bedi, who lashed out against the developments in a series of tweets, then trained her guns on the Chief Secretary. “The irresponsible and immature conduct of the Chief Secretary has brought huge anguish and rift in the governance of Puducherry,” she tweeted.


  However, Mr. Manoj Parida said, “The Chief Secretary, who at the highest level, is accountable to the Ministry of Human Affairs, has full powers to give additional charge to any officer temporarily. Besides, in this matter, the Speaker’s orders are final and binding,” he said.


  It is also pointed out that neither has the Ministry of Home Affairs nor the Lt. Governor have yet issued any order overruling the Chief Secretary’s decision.


  Meanwhile, barring the BJP, political parties across the spectrum are ranged against the Lt. Governor. An all-party delegation plans to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister to press for Ms. Bedi’s recall.


  Ms. Bedi has not backed down yet and has reaffirmed her stand that she would not be a figurehead administrator. Ironically, it is a similar refusal to be a lame-duck administration by the Congress Ministry with the mandate of the people behind it, that forms the crux of the crisis in Puducherry.

Rebalancing is designed to get your asset allocation back to its target after it's been thrown out of whack by the stock downturn. So if your target asset allocation is 60 per cent stocks and 40 per cent investment grade bonds, and stocks have declined by 20 per cent while your investment grade bonds are unchanged in value, the resulting asset allocation for now would be 55 per cent stocks and 45 per cent bonds. To rebalance, you would sell bonds and buy stocks until the asset allocation again reached 60 per cent stocks/40 per cent bonds.

She is known for her colorful writing and speaking style and for her ability to engage in a healthy give and take with the justices. She was also a prominent liberal supporter of Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious Senate confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court.


  Each lawyer will get two uninterrupted minutes to make an opening statement, after which Roberts will kick off the questioning. After that, the justices will ask questions in order of seniority, although the longest-serving justice, Clarence Thomas, almost never questions lawyers. Kavanaugh, who joined the court in 2018, will go last.


  The court sometimes issues opinions at the start of argument sessions, with the justice who wrote for the majority reading a summary of the opinion and, more rarely, a second justice summarizing a dissent. But in another change wrought by the virus outbreak, opinions are being posted online without any statements from justices. The court will next issue opinions on Thursday.

The Flynn Effect’ was the phrase Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray coined in their book _The Bell Curve_ , to describe the enormous gains in IQ scores in the 20th century from one generation to the next, which James R Flynn, Professor Emeritus at the University of Otago, did so much to measure and document. _What is Intelligence?_ , written for the general reader as well as the specialist, seeks to come to terms with the implications of those gains. It also attempts to analyse the evolution of intelligence, to ‘solve the problem of defining (it)’ and to discuss a new approach to the subject based on treating ‘the brain, individual differences, and social trends as having equal integrity.’

“The problem with the Chinese is that they are never forthcoming with information,” Keller said. “A lot of times you can’t trust it. Our intelligence people are going to have to get to the bottom of this.”
 Keller said China needed to be held accountable for the worldwide pandemic however it actually began. President Trump, he noted, may have some information which has not yet been released to the Oversight Committee.
 Keller said there was reason for optimism as more is known about flattening the curve of coronavirus cases. As more science is applied, more will be understood about behavior associated with its spread and how to care for family and friends.
 However, the unemployment rate, Gross Domestic Product and consumer confidence numbers may take shocking swings in the months ahead. Projections of second quarter numbers have been bleak. Keller said the prospects were expected considering what has unfolded in 2020 to date.
 “I think some of what has happened may be baked into the stock market,” he said. “It may come down some, but we sort of going into it understanding that so it’s not a surprise.”
 Economic fundamentals, Keller added, were strong before the pandemic. He projected that once people get back to work, the economic rebound will be substantial.

The ratio of children to the overall population fell for the 46th straight year to a new low of 12.0 percent, below South Korea's 12.4 percent and the lowest among 32 countries with a population of 40 million or more, according to the U.N. Demographic Yearbook.
 By contrast, people age 65 and over account for 28.6 percent of Japan's population, reflecting the graying of society.
 The child population peaked at 29.89 million in 1954. The number briefly picked up in the early 1970s but has continued to fall since 1982.
 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to tackle the nation's declining and aging population by promoting women's empowerment in society and increasing the number of day care facilities, but his efforts have yet to bear fruit.
 The government has set a goal of lifting the total fertility rate — the average number of children born to a woman — to 1.8 by the end of fiscal 2025, from 1.42 in 2018.
 Those age between 12 and 14 comprised the largest group of children at 3.21 million, while newborns to 2-year-olds totaled 2.75 million. By gender, there were 7.74 million boys and 7.38 million girls, the ministry said.
 Among the 47 prefectures, Tokyo was the only one that saw an increase in the number of children, with 1.55 million, more than 20 times that of Tottori, the prefecture with the lowest total. Tottori announced last Oct. 1 it had a child population of 70,000.
 Okinawa had the highest ratio of children in its overall population at 16.9 percent, while Akita logged the lowest at 9.8 percent, the first time any prefecture has dropped below 10 percent since comparable data became available in 1970.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate will gavel in Monday as the coronavirus rages, returning to an uncertain agenda and deepening national debate over how best to confront the deadly pandemic and its economic devastation.With the House staying away due to the health risks, and the 100 senators convening for the first time since March, the conflicted Congress reflects an uneasy nation. The Washington area remains a virus hot-spot under stay-home rules.Tops on the Senate agenda is not necessarily the next virus aid package, despite a nationwide jobless rate that's approaching Great Depression-level heights and pleas from the governors for more money."There's kind of a pause period right now," said White House's Larry Kudlow, director of the national economic counsel, on CNN. "Let's see how it's doing as we gradually reopen the economy."Senate Republicans are trying to set the terms of debate, frustrated that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was able to fill up earlier aid bills with Democratic priorities. They’re reluctant to unleash federal funds beyond the nearly $3 trillion Congress already approved in virus relief."We are going to need more help," Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, the chairman of the National Governors Association, said on CNN. Instead, Senate Republicans are counting on the country's reopening to kick- start the economy as their best hope to limit a new round of big spending on virus aid.President Donald Trump, on the eve of the Senate's return, held a town hall encouraging Americans to get back to work. "We have to reopen our country," Trump said, even as he revised upward his projection for the total U.S. death total to 80,000 or 90,000.The COVID-19 crisis has all but closed Congress since late March, a longer absence than during the 1918 Spanish Flu or the 2001 terror attacks. In making a snap decision to return, Senate Majority Mitch McConnell said the Senate cannot "sit on the sidelines." He compared the senators to the essential work force of grocery clerks, truck drivers and others keeping Americans fed during the crisis.Yet re-opening part of Capitol Hill poses health risks not just for the lawmakers but the cooks, cleaners, police officers and other workers who keep the lights on at the Capitol complex.Capitol Hill erupted late last week after the attending physician informed top GOP officials the health office did not have the means to perform instant virus tests on returning lawmakers or staff. Over the weekend, Trump himself offered Congress access to the instant virus test system used to screen visitors to the White House. But in an extraordinary rebuff, McConnell and Pelosi said in a rare joint statement Saturday that they would "respectfully decline" the offer and instead direct resources to the front lines "where they can do the most good."Senators will instead return to a partially reopened Capitol Hill with new guidelines, including the recommendation that senators wear masks — blue face coverings will be available for free — keep their distance and leave most staff at home. Hand sanitizer is back in stock. But public access will be limited, including at public hearings. The Capitol itself remains closed to visitors and tours. Democrats complain the risks of reopening the Capitol complex is not worth the noticeably light agenda, which is focused on confirming Trump's judicial and executive nominees rather than the virus pandemic.With more than 65,000 U.S. deaths due to the virus and 30 million Americans suddenly unemployed, Democratic senators say the focus needs to be singular — to ease this crisis and prevent a second wave of infections."If we're going to go back, let's do something about COVID," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.McConnell has loaded up the agenda with hearings for Trump's nominees, including Justin Walker, a conservative, McConnell-backed pick to be a federal judge on the U.S. Courts of Appeal in the District of Columbia Circuit, which is seen as a stepping stone to the Supreme Court. A nomination hearing also is scheduled for John Ratcliffe, the Texas Republican congressman who is Trump's choice to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Several committees will meet to debate issues related to the virus outbreak, including the nominee for a new oversight commission. The Health Committee will hold a session on potential cures and the Commerce Committee a hearing on the airline industry. For all that's changed during the pandemic, some traditions remain in Congress.Republican senators still plan to sit down for their regular luncheons, though the physician's social distancing guidance limits them to three to a table. It was after one of their lunches in March that several senators went into self-quarantine because of their exposure to fellow GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who tested positive.Democrats, who will meet for lunch over conference call, are assessing whether to appear in person for the committee hearings or dial in remotely.The physician's office sent guidelines late Friday encouraging Senate offices to minimize staff presence and reschedule any visitors who are visibly ill with "shaking chills" or "vomiting."But for Republicans, operating the Senate even in a diminished capacity aligns with Trump’s effort to return to a sense of normalcy, despite the ongoing health risks.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.
