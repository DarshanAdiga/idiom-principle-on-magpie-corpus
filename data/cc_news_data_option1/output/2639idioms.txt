The last two years have seen extreme swings in Pooja Dhanda's career. The Haryana wrestler had capped 2018 with a 57kg bronze at the World Championships in Budapest following silver at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast.And just when her confidence was sky high, she suffered shoulder and knee injuries in 2019, which spoilt her chance of earning a berth in the national squad for the continental Olympic qualifiers. With some of the best grapplers in her category, Dhanda lost to Anshul Malik in the national trials for the Asian Olympic Qualifiers in January this year. And, with it her hopes of going to Tokyo were all but over.But the postponement of the Games to next year has rekindled her hopes of making the cut for Tokyo. The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) will most likely hold fresh trials next year to select the best team for the Asian Olympic Qualifiers, which too were postponed this year in the aftermath of the pandemic."The cancellation of the international calendar and shifting of the Tokyo Olympics to 2021 has given me one more chance to stay in the race. The selection process will start again. It will be one big opportunity for me to bounce back," says Dhanda.On the forgettable 2019 when she suffered a spate of injuries, Dhanda says, "It was a shoulder injury I suffered during the World Championships in 2018 which flared up. Then it was the knee. So, it became difficult to make much progress. I was just busy undergoing rehab last year. It came as a huge setback in pre-Olympic year."You have to be super fit, otherwise it's difficult to make the cut as domestic competitions are getting tough," the 25-year-old says of her loss to Malik in the trials.Dhanda says sports activities have resumed in her hometown Hisar but she isn't keen on outdoor training as the "situation is not conducive". "The best place to train right now is home. I'm only doing basic fitness and weight training."While some wrestlers may have started training on the mat, Dhanda says she isn't keen. "I don't want to train with local wrestlers who I am not sure have maintained social distancing."She says it will take 6-8 weeks to tune up her body to be ready for practice on the mat. "I want to go slow as there is no competition this year. My focus is to stay healthy and prepare for the challenging domestic trials next year."

Detroit lost their final eight games with Stafford sidelined with a back injury so his value to the team is clear. With good targets around him, Stafford can bounce back in 2020.

Flying the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Commander Pushpanjali Potsangbam has been airlifting Indians stranded in different parts of the world and bringing them back home amid the COVID-19 pandemic.But the New Delhi-based Air India pilot has not been able to meet her husband, well-known India footballer Gouramangi Singh, for the past four months as she got down to quietly go about her task.As a Commander with Air India, the Manipuri woman is part of the government's Vande Bharat mission to rescue stranded Indians from across the world.The former India central defender, whose foray into organic farming recently created quite a buzz, feels worried and proud at the same time."It feels good when one of your own is trying to do something for the country during a time as unprecedented as this. I understand it's a very difficult and stressful job. Yes, I would be lying if I say it doesn't worry me," Gouramangi told PTI.Pushpanjali has been working with the country's biggest carrier for the past 11 years, having started out as a first officer."Last week she was in Lagos (Africa) for bringing back Indian citizens stuck there. She only operates on the international sectors," said the 34-year-old.It is not easy when one has to undergo the COVID-19 test three times for operating a single flight -- before departure for destination, on arrival at base and then another after five days of touching down at one's base."It is very stressful and then there is always that fear of the virus. Hats off to them, my wife and all her colleagues who are on the frontline like doctors and nurses," a proud husband said.He has waited long enough and is now set to visit the national capital and reunite with his wife."I am coming there in the next few days. Delhi has been my second home for some years now."Gouramangi is one of the most decorated players in Indian football in recent times -- having won the National Football League, Federation Cup and I-League titles, along with the AIFF Player of the Year award in 2010.He was also a part of India's triumphant Nehru Cup campaigns in 2007 and 2009 and the AFC Asian Cup in 2011, where he scored the team's opener against Bahrain.He is hoping that the situation normalises and sporting activities resume."I understand we all are helpless but we can't be hopeless. I have heard the AIFF is trying to arrange a competition when things improve a bit and then get the go-ahead to decide the winner of second division league and find a qualifier for the I-league," he said.After a successful 14-year career as a professional footballer, Gouramangi signed up as the first team coach for FC Bengaluru United, which plays in the country's second division league.Besides, the player with 71 international appearances had sometime ago teamed up with entrepreneur Karan Huidrom to open KaGo Football Training Centre (KFTC) with its own artificial turf for development of grassroots football in Manipur.It is mainly meant to attract aspiring players, boys and girls, from the age of 6 years and onwards.

Devendra Fadnavis, former Maharashtra chief minister and leader of opposition in Maharashtra assembly, on Monday, visited Thane, which has crossed 10,000 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases amid a spike in the viral outbreak in the densely populated Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and suggested a raft of measures to contain the spread of the pandemic.He recommended that the state government pay more attention to the Covid-19-hit civic bodies, whose financial condition is not all that robust and are also in dire need of infrastructure and manpower."All civic bodies are not financially stable, even though funds have been allocated to various municipal corporations. The government also has to provide them with proper infrastructure and manpower because they are relying on private hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients," he said. Fadvanis visited the quarantine centers in Thane, the 1,000-bed Covid-19 facility at Balkum and also met Dr. Vipin Sharma, who has recently taken charge as the Thane Municipal Commissioner (TMC) He also suggested that the Covid-19 test results need to be made available within 24 hours, as the delay often leads to the administration's inability to provide timely treatment. "The daily test count needs to be increased, which will help get better clarity about the extent of the spread of the disease, and also a solution to tackle the healthcare crisis can be found. There shouldn't be any attempt to suppress data related to Covid-19, as it would worsen the handling of the pandemic," he said.He alleged that the Mumbai Police's botched transfer bid amid the viral outbreak is an indication of distrust between Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Home Minister Anil Deshmukh. "Ideally, the decision related to transfer is taken by the Home Minister, while keeping the CM in the loop. However, it is clear that the CM was not aware of the transfers, which led to the scrapping of the order at the eleventh hour," the former CM added.

Government-imposed quarantine measures in 36 countries across Africa and the Middle East (AME) account for 40% of all quarantine measures globally. With over 80% of travellers unwilling to travel when quarantine is required, the impact of these measures is that countries remain in lockdown even if their borders are open.   "It is critical that AME governments implement alternatives to quarantine measures. AME has the highest number of countries in the world with government-imposed quarantine measures on arriving passengers. The region is effectively in complete lockdown with the travel and tourism sector shuttered. This is detrimental in a region where 8.6 million people depend on aviation for their livelihoods," said Muhammad Albakri, IATA's Regional Vice President for Africa and the Middle East.

The St. Bernard Market opened there in 1854, as one of three dozen public markets operated by the city at the time. According to a Times-Picayune story by Ian McNulty, one of the market’s produce vendors, Herbert Gabriel, eventually bought out his fellow vendors and consolidated the market as a full-service grocery store. The distinctive Spanish mission-style building that sits on the site today was designed in 1931 by architect Sam Stone Jr. It opened as Circle Food Store in 1938.          The store took its name from the traffic circle that used to exist at the intersection. In addition to selling groceries, the store had a wide range of products and offered the services of a pharmacy, doctor, dentist and chiropractor.          The store was one of the most prominent of the many Black-owned businesses in the neighborhood, which drastically changed with construction of Interstate 10 above Claiborne Avenue in the 1960s.          In the 1990s, the Boudreaux family bought the store, which in 2005 was inundated by Hurricane Katrina’s floodwaters. The store reopened in 2014 but closed in 2018.          Last year, developer Sidney Torres IV and a partner, Rick El-Jaouhari, bought the property at a foreclosure auction for $1.7 million. They spent another $1.2 million to reopen it as Circle Food Market in February.
