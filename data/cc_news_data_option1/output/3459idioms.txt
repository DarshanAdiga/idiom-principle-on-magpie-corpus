So sorry to hear that Howard has passed away. During the several years we worked together at Sears on the SQP program, we became friends, and I still remember his dry wit with fondness. May your memories of all your happy times together help you in the coming days.

So while Football Outsiders' forecast of the Dolphins' 2020 outlook isn't great, there's at least a silver lining to how Miami's season is modeled. And, at the end of the day, they play the games on the field for a reason — the Dolphins will have every opportunity to once again outplay their expectations. Should it happen two seasons in a row, it might be time for everyone to readjust their scope of how Miami's coaching and intangibles can impact their ability on the field.

Howard passed away suddenly at home in Janetville in his 79th year. His beloved wife of 57 years, Annette (Low), was by his side. Son of Raymond and Evelyn (Evans), Howard was born in Chatham, educated in Sarnia, and moved to Rexdale in 1961 where he met and married his best friend for life. Throughout a long career with Sears, they moved from Vineland to Burlington to Janetville. Howard also served in the Canadian Armed Forces and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Legion poppy campaign and volunteer at the Ross Memorial Hospital. Howard was the much loved father of Kim and Al, and grandfather of Nate (Lumbis) and his partner Clairisa; brother of Judith (DiProfio), David and Ric. He will be missed by the extended Low family and many true friends. A private interment has taken place in Lindsay. A Celebration of Life will take place at a later date when the people Howard loved can gather in health and safety. If desired, a donation in Howard's memory can be made to the Ross Memorial Hospital Foundation. A Message from Howard: Weep no more my loved ones and friends, for I am with the Lord I do not suffer; wipe away the tears and rejoice Life is a journey, and death is simply one milestone in that journey I have lived a full life and have been blessed with true friendships The riches I have accumulated are the memories of these friendship, and the love I have felt over the years from all my extended family Take time to reflect on the joys of the past Be proud of your accomplishments Take time to enjoy your future and live every day as if it is your last For today truly is the first day of the rest of your life Never be afraid of failure As it is this fear that prevents accomplishments and greatness Step out now, take risks and reap the benefits If you stumble, pick yourself up, dust yourself off and move forward Learn from failure and turn it into success Because success is simply failure turned upside down Problems are simply opportunities dressed in working clothes Recognize mistakes made along life journey and learn from them Above all, be kind to family, friends and your fellow man Help someone in need and expect nothing in return The seeds of kindness will never be forgotten --- how well I know I love you all.

My deepest condolences to the Tremaine family. Although Howard and I were not in touch for the past few years I have many fond Memories of working with Howard during our many years at Sears. He was a very loyal and kind man. Always willing to pitch in and help whenever he could. We had a brief reunion in Cobourg a few years back and were able to reminisce over the many joys we had working together. Rest In Peace my friend. Barry Toner

Hey, people who are freaking the fark out are getting chemically sedated rather than having police kneel on their necks.      Apparently the Fark Left doesn't want either one.  They want people to freak the fark out and flail wildly at everything.  Hell, Virginia just reduced the penalty for assaulting a police officer from a felony to a misdemeanor. Anything goes!

To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Bloomin Brands's $3.43 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.35. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.

The Miami Dolphins have made a concentrated effort this offseason to get better in the running game. The Dolphins, who featured veteran quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick as the team's leading rusher in 2019, would love nothing more than to avoid a repeat team rushing title for Fitzpatrick in 2020. With the additions of Jordan Howard and Matt Breida in the backfield for Miami — plus a completely retooled and overhauled offensive line, the Dolphins appear primed to be a better team rushing the ball this season.

Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Priority Tech Holdings has $449.70 million in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 1.09. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries.
