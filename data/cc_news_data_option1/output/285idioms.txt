Sebastian County circuit judge candidates all want to make the community a better place, but each one brings different experiences and perspectives to the table.
 Public Defender Rita Howard Watkins and private attorneys Phil Milligan and Greg Magness are vying for the Division VI circuit judge seat. District Judge Sam Terry and attorney Diana Hewitt Ladd compete for the District VII seat.
 Circuit courts in Arkansas cover criminal, civil, probate, domestic and juvenile matters.
 Circuit Judge elections are March 3.
 Division VI
 • Rita Howard Watkins has served in the Sebastian County Public Defender's Office since 2020. She has also worked as a staff attorney in Oklahoma and in business law in Oregon.
 Watkins said she believes her experience in circuit court as a public defender in Sebastian County Circuit Court gives her an edge as a candidate. She said she is often in circuit court three or four times a week and has worked in a number of cases including juvenile court, petition to revoke warrants and trials.
 "What I want you to know is, the reason I want to be a judge in Sebastian County is I want to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and justly, no matter what your background is and no matter what you overcome and what you do," Watkins said.
 • Phil Milligan has 28 years of experience in law, including in civil and criminal matters, including in his own private practice. He also served as an FBI agent in Milwaukee.
 Milligan during the panel said his experience both in law and federal law enforcement makes him "uniquely qualified" to serve as District VI Judge. He said it's especially important in District VI, which sees 50% of civil jury matters and 20% of felony criminal jury matters.
 "It's a tremendously technical and important bench," Milligan said.
 • Greg Magness has been a law partner at Hardin, Jesson & Terry for almost 30 years. Magness largely works civil cases, from class action lawsuits to small claims.
 Magness said he has been to every county in Arkansas and "about half" of Oklahoma counties as a lawyer. From his experience in private law, Magness said he wants to bring respect and fairness if elected as judge.
 "Really, the question for me is, what is going to be the judicial disposition of the judge? In other words, someone that is committed to the constitutional structure of applying the law and not getting something from the legislature saying, 'I don't like that, I'm going to change that,'" he said. "That's what we're seeing across the country, and that's the crucial issue, is what's the judicial philosophy of the person?"
 District VII
 • Diana Hewitt Ladd has served as the prosecuting attorney for South Sebastian County District Court and surrounding counties for the past 17 years. She has tried more than 700 cases in Circuit Court and on multiple occasions has also served as a special judge
 Ladd said she believes she is the right choice for the District VII seat because she has more prosecutor experience in Circuit Court and has experience as a judge.
 "Let's make sure we have judges on the bench who are experienced, have the right temperament and have the integrity," she said.
 • Sam Terry was appointed in July 2019 to his current Sebastian County District Judge position. He was previously an attorney for First National Bank of Fort Smith, a deputy Sebastian County prosecuting attorney and law clerk for U.S. District Judge P.K. Holmes.
 Terry said he is qualified to preside over District VII because he is a full- time judge, even if it isn't as a circuit judge.
 "Nothing at all to denigrate Diana's career, because she's had a good career as a good attorney," Terry said. "The experience as a judge is what matters, and I'm by far the more qualified candidate."

“It remains to be seen if there will still be a contested presidential primary,” Woon said. “Some years there is, some years there isn’t.”
 The primaries are currently set up so that a candidate needs 2,026 delegates to win the race. Delegates are given proportionally to candidates depending on the percentage of the vote they receive in each state. The larger the population of the state, the more delegates are given out.
 Oregon is currently on the schedule as the 46th state in the primary schedule which means that a candidate could have already picked up the necessary amount delegates, making Oregon’s votes just a second thought.
 There are lightly populated states that are anything but a second thought — these are the first four. Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina (in order) only make up a meager 156 delegates — California has 415 on its own for comparison — but they represent a major momentum indicator for candidates. States that are in these first four or states that contain a large amount of delegates often get far more attention from candidates – meaning Oregon usually doesn’t.
 For UO sophomore Kyle Purdy, this doesn’t sit well. Purdy began researching the issue for an independent study research paper which brought him to the steps of many state legislators and eventually to Salem where he testified in front of state representatives. Purdy’s bill did not pass but the discussion is still worth having, according to Purdy.
 The issue isn’t solely about getting attention from candidates, but also getting a broader range of choices. If a candidate can’t get to 15% of the vote in a state, then they are not awarded any delegates. This often means that candidates will drop off over the months as they fail to gain traction. But this also means some candidates may not be on the ballot when the vote makes it way to Oregon.
 “Imagine Mathew Knight Arena. If Bernie or Warren or Biden or Buttigieg came and had a big rally, it’d be great,” Purdy said.

Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests have gained clinical acceptance world over as a non-specific serological test for syphilis, a sexually transmitted diseases. They are further complemented by treponemal tests (TPHA). The rising cases of repeat syphilis in various parts of the world has helped in driving demand for a cost-effective serological test in different healthcare settings. This is a key factor underpinning the prospects of the rapid plasma reagin test. Over the years, the market has made strides on the back of the growing role of RPR as an important marker of high risk behavior in populations. Hence, RPR tests have a large role to play in reproductive health of individuals as well as in ante-natal care. However, the healthcare industry has constantly struggled with false positivity of RPR in blood donors.

While Arkansas' voters will be casting their ballots in March and November this year, the state's two U.S. senators will be looking toward future elections. For Sen. John Boozman, it's 2022. For Sen. Tom Cotton, it's 2024.
 Cotton is up for re-election this year but doesn't have to worry about campaigning. That's because the Democrats' candidate, Josh Mahony, abruptly and with little explanation quit the race hours after the filing period ended, leaving the party with no legal path toward finding a replacement.
 There is a Libertarian candidate, Ricky Harrington Jr., who will need a favorable court ruling to stay on the ballot, and an independent, Daniel Whitfield, who must collect 10,000 verified signatures of registered voters.
 Regardless, Cotton easily will win re-election and would have been re-elected if Mahony had stayed in the race, or against any Democrat. Maybe Mike Beebe could have made it interesting.
 But now he doesn't even have to bother with it. In fact, he's not really an Arkansas figure anymore, but instead he's a national one with obvious presidential ambitions. Instead of campaigning in Arkansas, he can invest his time and his millions of campaign dollars on increasing his national profile. Within three years, he'll be spending as much time in Iowa and New Hampshire as he does in Arkansas.
 In contrast, Arkansas' senior senator, Sen. John Boozman, has never been a national figure and in fact has been a quiet state one. In the latest Arkansas Poll by University of Arkansas political scientist Dr. Janine Parry, 31% of very likely voters didn't offer an opinion as to whether they approved or disapproved of him. Only 16% offered no opinion about Cotton.
 Boozman told Talk Business & Politics this month that he's planning on running for re-election in 2022. He's 69 and has had health problems in the past, but he appears ready for another race. A big motivation is potentially chairing the Senate Agriculture Committee. He's the second highest ranking member behind the chairman, Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts, who is retiring, so he'll likely get that slot next year.
 The Agriculture Committee chairmanship would be a plum assignment for Arkansas and a good fit for Boozman, so it's understandable why he would want to stay in politics for a term that would end when he is 78 years old.
 But this election cycle could affect his calculations, because it will determine who controls the Senate and who becomes chairman.
 Republicans have a 53-47 majority, which means they would maintain control with 51 senators, or 50 if President Trump is re-elected. (The vice president casts the tie-breaking vote.)
 Thirty-five seats are up for re-election, of which 23 are held by Republicans, so they're defending a lot of turf. Republicans are vulnerable in several races, particularly in Maine, Colorado, North Carolina, and Arizona, where Sen. Martha McSally was appointed to the office after losing the 2018 Senate race to a Democrat. Meanwhile, Republicans will probably flip Alabama, currently held by Democrat Sen. Doug Jones.
 If Republicans maintain Senate control after November, then Boozman would go into 2022 as Agriculture Committee chairman and would likely follow through on his plans for re-election. But if Democrats win control of the Senate, then Boozman would be only the ranking minority member, a major step down. And if Trump loses the election and Democrats maintain control of the House, then would Boozman really want to spend his early 70s in Washington waiting for his party to return to power?
 Whatever happens in 2020, Boozman will have to consider the lay of the land in 2022. Depending on what happens in Arizona this year, Republicans will be defending 21 or 22 Senate seats, including his, compared to 12 or 13 defended by the Democrats.
 A lot can change by then, and besides, you don't become a U.S. senator unless you're willing to take risks. However, even risk-takers make calculations, and Boozman could have plenty to calculate by 2022.
 I'm pretty sure Cotton has made his calculations. His next appearance on a ballot will be in 2020 in Arkansas, but he's already looking to the one after that - in Iowa in 2024.

Alf Dubs, un miembro de la cámara alta que llegó de la Europa ocupada por los nazis a Gran Bretaña como niño refugiado dijo que el gobierno enviaba una señal “muy negativa”.
 Pidió que no se use a los niños migrantes como “moneda de cambio” en las negociaciones sobre las futuras relaciones entre la Unión Europea y Gran Bretaña.
 “Si el gobierno quiere refutar la acusación de que es mezquino y maligno, seguramente lo mejor que puede hacer es aceptar la enmienda”, dijo Dubs.
 La oficina del primer ministro dijo que el gobierno no aceptará ninguno de los cambios de la Cámara de los Lores al proyecto que establece las condiciones de la partida británica del bloque el 31 de enero.
 El gobierno dice que su intención es seguir recibiendo a los niños migrantes en Gran Bretaña, pero que esa disposición no corresponde a la ley de salida.
 Las dos cámaras del Parlamento deben aprobar el proyecto de ley para que Gran Bretaña pueda salir en la fecha prevista.

The typical rule of thumb given by financial planners is to have a goal of saving up to 20% of total earnings. But if you want to retire when you're younger, that percentage will probably need to be more like 40% to 50% of your income. Of course, that's not so simple since a big part of your paycheck goes to day-to-day, necessary expenses. So if you want to save that much, you need to make some serious lifestyle adjustments. It requires making changes, but it's doable.

In such environments, customer- facing technologies create relevant and contextual digital interactions to elevate customer experience. The customer-facing technology market includes digital signage, digital kiosks, rugged tablets, mobile Point-of-Sale (mPOS), and other devices and software applications. Customer-facing technology provides increased intelligence and improved customer service through efficient processes.

Linda Watts, commissioner for the Bureau for Children and Families, estimated the new requirement would cost between $14 million and $16 million, which gave some delegates heartburn. Del. Jim Butler, R-Mason, said while he wants to help families more, without a firm number on how much it would cost, he did not think it was prudent to include the amendment at this time, especially because the bill is only second referenced to the Judiciary Committee and not Finance.
 Del. Jeff Pack, R-Raleigh, said he initially was hesitant about the addition but said he figured the bill would end up in Finance, which would give DHHR plenty of time to figure out the fiscal impact.
 “This is a phenomenal bill,” Pack said. “I said to someone earlier if I am never part of anything else going forward, to be a part of something that does so much good for foster families, I can die happy. With that being said, I support this note with the understanding that it has a ways to go and we will have the opportunity to figure this out, but I don’t want this to die here and now.”
 The bill also now requires DHHR pay child placement agencies a minimum daily rate of $75 for services provided to each child in placement, with the agency reimbursing foster parents at least 40% of that rate. Pack said $75 is the average daily operating cost for child placement agencies, and the goal is to have them break even so they can use fundraisers to provide even more support services for children and families.
 Pack also offered an amendment, which was accepted, which requires guardians ad litem, the court-appointed representation for a child in abuse and neglect cases, give their report to the parent, guardian or custodian (or their counsel) within five days of a dispositional hearing. The report must contain the signature of the foster parent indicating the guardian ad litem met with the child.

PHOENIX (KPHO/KTVK/CNN) – Police said a mother has confessed to smothering her three small children to death, all of them under the age of four.Court paperwork describes a horror scene at the Phoenix residence Monday night.Rachel Henry, 22, was home with her children while their father and another relative were out.A police report says she admitted to smothering each child, starting with her 1-year-old daughter.“Rachel was playing with the 1-year-old female and was wrestling on top of her. Rachel felt the 1-year-old female’s breathing was obstructed but continued to impede her breath by placing her hand over the 1-year-old female’s mouth,” the police report states, as reported by KPHO.Henry’s 3-year-old son yelled at her and punched her to get her to stop, according to the police report.The report says she then chased after the boy, but was “interrupted” when her relatives returned home.The report says one of the relatives spent time playing with the boy, but that a short time later Henry took the boy into a back bedroom, where she "placed the 3-year-old male on the floor of the bedroom, straddled him with one of her legs and placed her hand over his nose and mouth."The report says she sang to the boy, who scratched and pinched her as she smothered him.Police say Henry then gave her 7-month-old daughter a bottle until she fell asleep, then sang as she smothered her.The report says Henry then laid each of the children down on the living room couch as if they were taking a nap."We've seen stuff happen and everything around here, but nothing like this,” said a neighbor. “It was just terrible.”Henry was in court Tuesday, facing three counts of first-degree murder. She was given a $3 million bond."I don't have any money,” Henry told the judge. “I don't have a job or anything.""It's a sizable amount, I acknowledge,” the judge answered. “I do think the size of the bond is appropriate, based on the accusations against you in these initial hearings."Police said Henry has struggled with addiction.According to investigators, family welfare services in Oklahoma took her children away because of her drug problem.Henry’s friends in Oklahoma are trying to come to terms with how this could have happened."Her little boy was super sweet,” said a high school friend of Henry’s who asked not to be identified. “He was a little shy, but he was super sweet.”The woman said she was good friends with Henry in high school in Oklahoma, but lost touch more than a year ago."She just never really showed emotion, never really cared about anything,” the woman said. “She was always crazy, but never seemed like that kind of crazy."The woman said this isn’t the girl she grew up with."I'm disappointed, and I'm heartbroken,” she said. “I don't understand how she could do something like that.”Copyright 2020 KPHO, KTVK via CNN.

I'm not going to say too much about that at the moment, because it's going to get complicated. I think what's going to happen is, whether I like it or not, _The Island_ is going to reboot itself. Right now, it's managed to metamorphose from being just a comic book series into a television series, too. I also think somebody would adapt this project even if I wasn't going to. _Moreau_ 's time has come. For some bizarre reason, we're living in a year where talking animal movies are very popular, with _Cats_ just behind us, and _Dolittle_ now out, as well as Baz Luhrmann wanting to make _The Master and Margarita_ , which features literature's most famous talking cat. I think _Moreau_ is a piece whose time has come.
