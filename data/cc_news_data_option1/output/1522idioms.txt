 While no formal vote was taken on Friday, Councilmember Courtney Hamilton remained opposed to lifting the ban. Twelve to 14 of the 18 standards could not be effectively enforced, she said, adding that health officials have told her that lifting restrictions could result in another surge of COVID-19 cases.

 'Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things'
 Through a plethora of interviews with minimalists, neuropsychologists, authors, economists and more, this documentary tries to demonstrate that less is more and that the American ideal that objects bring happiness is untrue.
 This documentary may or may not sway you to pursue a minimalist lifestyle in which you only own what you need, but at the very least, it will make you think twice before making a purchase and help you part with unnecessary belongings.
