Earlier in an interview with _TOI,_ singer Aditya Narayan shared how he met Shweta Agarwal and things went ahead. The duo met on the sets of _Shaapit,_ their debut film. He was quoted as saying, “Slowly and gradually, I realised I was head-over-heels in love and started pursuing her. Initially, she wanted to be ‘just friends', because we were both very young and needed to focus on our careers. Like every relationship, we have seen a lot of ups-and-downs over the last 10 years. My parents know Shweta and like her a lot. I am happy that I have found my soul mate in her.” Heartiest congratulations to Aditya and Shweta for the new innings in their lives!
