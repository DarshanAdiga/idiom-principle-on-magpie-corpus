DUNDEE – James Edgar Knapp, age 90, of Dundee, N.Y. passed away Monday (January 13, 2020) in the comfort of his home with his family at his side.      There are no prior calling hours. A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on Saturday (January 25) at the Barrington Community Church, Bath Rd., Dundee, N.Y. with Pastor Chuck Grant officiating.      In lieu of flowers memorial contributions may be made to the Keuka Comfort Care Home, P.O. Box, 107, Penn Yan, NY 14527.      James was born March 21, 1929 in the town of Barrington, N.Y., the youngest of seven children of the late William Crosby and Eva Laverna (Kenyon) Knapp. He graduated from Dundee Central School in 1947. On Sept. 27, 1947 in the Wayne Baptist Church he married the former Norma J. Torrence, who passed away on October 10, 2001. A life-long local resident, he was a self-employed vineyardist in 2015; he also once owned a chicken farm, and was the founder and creator of the Lakeview Campsite. Mr. Knapp was a former member of the Barrington Rifle Club, and numerous bowling leagues. His true passion and enjoyment was music, with a natural talent to play numerous instruments, but his claim to fame was as the lead electric guitar in the "Barrington Ridge Runners" and "Jayhawks" bands.      He is loved and will be forever missed by his four daughters Lana M. (Ray) Blowers of Penn Yan, Carla J. (James) DeForest of Greenville, N.Y., Lori J. Knapp and Mia A.

He was predeceased by three sisters Agnes, Clara and Wanda; and three brothers Clarence, Dayton, and Willie.      Arrangements are entrusted to the Baird Funeral Home, 36 Water Street, Dundee.

A memorial celebration of the life of Francis May Eachus, 92, will be held at 3 p.m. Monday, January 20, 2020, at Twelfth Street Baptist Church. Miss Eachus, a precious saint of the Lord, went to her home with Jesus on January 11, 2020. She was the fifth child born to the late Fred and Ida (Deal) Eachus on April 14, 1927, in Brighton, Colorado. She was preceded in death by her sisters, Marion Kramer and Helen Bundy; brother, Fred Eachus Jr.; brothers-in-law, Marvin Kramer, Merrill Bundy and Tommy Scott; missionary co- translator and dear friend, Ruth Carlson. Left to cherish her memories in Cheyenne, Wyoming, are her sister, Margaret Scott; niece, Susan Scott Plamondon; nephews, Stephen (Sarah) Scott, David (Julee) Kramer and Lester (Sue) Bundy; in Aurora, CO, special friend/supporter Ron (Martha) Graham; along with numerous friends and supporters locally and across North and Central America. Francis May Eachus, an amazing saint of our Lord Jesus Christ, spent her life on the mission fields in Mexico and Guatemala. Baptized at the age of 12, Fran received a B.A. degree in business education from the University of Northern Colorado. From there, the Lord led her to attend Trinity Seminary in Chicago, Illinois, where she learned about the Wycliffe Bible Translators. As a WBT translator, Fran met Ruth Carlson, and the two served in Chiapas, Mexico, two years before being requested to minister in Guatemala to the K'ekchi' Indians. Fran and Ruth lived among the K'ekchi', learned their language, wrote an alphabet for their language, and taught the K'ekchi' to read from primers that they created themselves. Fran and Ruth then translated the New Testament into the K'ekchi' language, followed by translation of the Old Testament. To this day, 100,000 K'ekchi' Bibles have been printed and distributed to the K'ekchi' people, providing them the opportunity to read and cherish the word of God in their heart language. After 58 years of serving the K'ekchi' of Guatemala, Fran felt it best to return to the United States at the age of 86 due to health issues. She chose to reside at Regency Pointe in Rainbow City near friends who could help support her needs. This location was also in close proximity to missionary comrades who had served in Guatemala with Fran and had retired to the States, including Mike (late) and Kay Owen, Jim and Carol McGriff, and Wendell (late) and Jane Parker – dear comrades who also identified with the struggles Fran faced leaving the home she loved in Guatemala to a home that was now strange to her. While at Regency Pointe, Fran found happiness making new friends, receiving visits from her family and friends, and being visited by those in her large missionary network across North and Central America. Fran continued to work vigorously on K'ekchi' translation work for missionaries still in the fields of Guatemala and Belize until the age of 91 when she lost her eyesight. She even did some K'ekchi' translating for the U.S. Government. After her return to the United States, Fran was a faithful member of Hopkins Chapel, a mission church of Twelfth Street Baptist Church, and regularly attended the children's mission program at Twelfth Street Baptist. Fran's personal mission story was graciously shared with many churches as well as with the Blind and Low Vision Support Group, which she attended after losing her sight. Fran's story was best explained in her autobiography, A Cup of Good Water. Fran's last year was quite a challenge for her. Special thanks to Compassionate Comforters for providing exceptional care and friendship during this trying time, especially to caretakers Mary Wyatt, Lisa Naylor, Rosie Bellew and Kasey Usry. Much appreciation also to Encompass Hospice and Dr. Debora Reiland. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Twelfth Street Baptist Church Building Fund or Wycliffe Bible Translators. Francis May Eachus was a mighty, awesome saint whose tenacious spirit blazed a trail for the K'ekchi' of Guatemala to know Jesus in a deep and meaningful way. She will celebrate in heaven with many who are present due to her love and commitment to her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Fran's mark on earth will last throughout eternity; her life was an inspiration to all!

We hadn't had the new microwave that long when, all of a sudden, it decided it just didn't want to microwave anymore.      "You had one job," I said to the microwave, chastising it after it failed to reheat some leftovers. "Is that really so hard?"      Naturally, I had no idea what went into making a microwave microwave. I assumed it probably had something to do with the sun, since it used microwaves, and maybe also radio waves or ultraviolet rays, and therefore there was surely a solar panel installed somewhere, that made it work, as well as a transistor radio and sunscreen. Since I had no experience with microwaves or radio waves or UV waves (except that one time when I was seven and I got a really bad sunburn), I thought this was all well out of my limited range of appliance repair knowledge and decided to call in a professional.      I looked online for a repairman in my area and chose Mike's Microwave repair because it had a number of good reviews and also, Mike and Microwave both begin with an M and I like alliteration. I had to wait two weeks for Mike to show up because apparently, there was a sudden epidemic of microwave deaths at the same time that mine pooped out. It was like some kind of microwave flu that must have been transmitted over the airwaves, or maybe the radio waves, I couldn't be certain.      By the time Mike finally arrived I was beside myself. I was a child of the microwave generation and never realized that food could also be reheated in an actual oven, so for two weeks I ate cold leftovers and brooded about how difficult life was without a microwave.      "I think it might be the fuse," said Mike when he finally arrived and did triage on my microwave. "It should be an easy fix, but there's a chance I might have to do open oven surgery. I need you to sign a release."      "A release?" I said. "For what?"      "Acknowledging that the appliance was not functioning when I arrived and nothing I did caused it to further malfunction."      "Fine," I said and signed the form. "But before you do anything, you should try pointing the satellite dish in a different direction to see if that solves the problem, because not only is the microwave broken, but also, our TV isn't getting very good reception."      He looked at me like I was one burner short of stovetop. "They have nothing to do with each other."      "What?" I said.      "Your microwave and your TV," he said. "Completely unrelated."      "Got it," I said. "But could you check the TV when you're done with the microwave, anyway?"      "I only do kitchen appliances," he said.      "But the TV is in the kitchen," I replied. Then I recalled that the ad said, Mike's Microwaves, and not Mike's Microwaves and TVs, so I decided to let it go.      I watched the one TV channel that worked well while Mike did surgery on the microwave. But when I decided to switch channels, all of a sudden, at the exact same time, the microwave whirred to life.      "Hah!" I yelled. "I fixed the microwave!"      "No, you didn't," said Mike. "I did. I put in a new fuse."      "I'm not so sure, Mike." I said assuredly. "I was on CNN and when I switched to HGTV, the microwave started to work again."      "I told you, they're not related," he argued.      I shrugged. "If you want to believe that, that's fine," I said. "I don't want to make waves."

 The issue revolves around ancillary providers — that is, doctors and other specialists who contract with, but are not employees of, medical facilities such as hospitals. Even if their hospitals accept standard health insurance, causing patients to believe all their services will be covered, these ancillary providers might not be included. Instead, they charge sometimes exorbitant out-of-network rates directly to patients who had expected their health plans to pick up the tab.

I look for things. It’s what I do. If we go for a walk together, you’ll probably have to slow down or else leave me behind. I can walk faster — but I’m looking for stuff. I look down at the ground, I look up in the sky, I look behind me and to both sides. Yes, I’m pokey. But I find stuff that other people miss.
 Most of it is just junk, although I’ve found cash a few times (singles, mostly, but once a $20 bill). People are really messy. We leave all kinds of crap scattered everywhere. I also find natural odds and ends. Some of it is really neat — to me, at least. This past fall I found three polyphemus moths (three separate occasions) lying dead among wind-blown leaves. Even in death they are beautiful, and the wings are easy to preserve.
 A lot of what I see is the small stuff others overlook. During a Florida Master Naturalist class field trip last year, I noticed a dung beetle that has been skewered on a barbed wire fence by a shrike (aka butcherbird). My classmates seemed surprised that I had noticed such a small thing and asked how I had seen it. I didn’t really have a good answer. It’s just what I do. They were even more surprised when I later pointed out live dung beetles rolling balls of cow manure.

When "Bad Boys," the cop-buddy film directed by Hollywood bad boy Michael Bay, and starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, was released 25 years ago, it took in just over $141 million at the box office. When "Bad Boys II," with the same directing-acting combo came out 17 years ago, ticket sales were $273 million. I didn't see either of those films until a week ago, when I sat down for a double feature on my living room couch.      And I liked them! A lot!! It was easy to see why they were such big hits. Both featured boatloads of action, breakneck editing, gobs of handleable violence, a steady thread of humor, snappy banter, a lush and richly saturated color scheme, and a believable and loving camaraderie between the two leads.      Over the years, I had also become - with the exception of his dizzyingly unwatchable "Transformers" films - an unabashed fan of Michael Bay. When I discovered he wasn't directing "Bad Boys for Life," and that it would be co- directed by the unfamiliar (to me) Adil El Arbi and Bilail Fallah, I had some negative thoughts.      But 10 minutes into it, and already caught up by all of the action, fast editing, violence, humor, camaraderie, etc., I knew I was in good hands. About 20 minutes later, when Michael Bay had a cameo as a wedding emcee, and I realized he had given the film his blessing (and later found out he produced it), I was settled in for the ride.      In fact, it opens with a ride - a wild one, with Mike Lowrey (Smith) at the wheel of his Porsche, zigzagging through a high-speed police chase in Miami, with his partner Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) in the passenger seat, screaming for him to slow down. But it turns out not to be a chase. It's a high-speed ride to a hospital, where Marcus' daughter is giving birth to his first grandson.      And so begins the story of what appears to be the dissolution of the partnership. Mike and Marcus have been together all these years, but now Marcus is considering retirement "because family is all that matters." To which Mike, with no thoughts of retirement, replies, "I'll be running down criminals till I'm 100!"      Meanwhile, somewhere in Mexico, there's a bloody jailbreak, a reunion of a vindictive mother and her murderous son, and a vengeful plan that includes making Mike the target of some bullets. With that plotline in play, it's safe to say that retirement is at least temporarily put on the backburner.      There's some dark, serious stuff going on here, but the writers and directors make sure to include a fair share of fun in the mix, and there's some funny crosscutting between action-man Mike still keeping up his old lifestyle and old-fashioned family man Marcus settling into his new one. To clarify, Mike wants revenge on those who tried to off him, and Marcus wants to enjoy life with his grandson.      Joe Pantoliano returns for his third portrayal of the overly excitable Captain Howard, a man who regularly needs a swig of Pepto Bismol whenever Mike goes rogue on him. Series newcomers Paola Nuñez, as the head of a special police team, and Kate del Castillo and Jacob Scipio, as the malevolent mother-son duo, are perfectly cast. But as with the first two entries, it's the onscreen relationship between Smith and Lawrence, the peanut butter and jelly of cop- buddy movies (that's a compliment), that makes the film work.      Their characters are similar in that they're committed to their jobs. They're different because ... well, Mike drives that Porsche, and Marcus drives his wife's Nissan Quest. The nice thing about them playing these action roles again after all this time is that they're convincing as a couple of guys who are too long in the tooth to do it, but can still do it. Will there be a "Bad Boys 4?" The script makes it feasible, but let's see how well this one does at the box office (my guess is very well).      Ed Symkus writes about movies for More Content Now. He can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

In a game that ultimately came down to free throws, the Hays High girls had the right player at the stripe when it mattered most on Tuesday night against Great Bend.
 Clinging to a one-point lead, Great Bend missed two free throws with 3.5 seconds left and Hays High's Tasiah Nunnery was bumped into for a Panthers foul after Nunnery grabbed the rebound off the second miss.
 The senior then calmly drained both free throws with 2.3 seconds left to give the Indians a 37-36 win.
 "Tasiah's our best free-throw shooter, so to have her at the line, I think our team felt confident she was going to put them in, and that's what happened," Hays High coach Kyle Porter said.
 Nunnery's free throws marked the Indians' only lead of the second half. They trailed by as much as nine in the third quarter but fought back to tie it on an Aleyia Ruder jumper with 1:22 left in the game. Great Bend regained the lead on a pair of free throws with just under a minute remaining.
 With the Indians down by two, Hays High's Isabel Robben was fouled with 8.2 seconds left, making the first and missing the second. Nunnery grabbed the rebound and missed a putback inside, but Robben grabbed another offensive board and was fouled. She missed both free throws but Great Bend's missed foul shots left the door open before Nunnery sank her two foul shots.
 Hays High snapped a five-game skid to move to 2-5 overall and 1-1 in WAC play. Great Bend, which was unable to get a shot off after Nunnery's free throws, dropped to 2-7 and 0-2 in the WAC.
 "This was a game where we didn't play very well. I felt like there was a lid on the basket the entire night," Porter said. "I felt like it was an uphill battle. But I'm really proud of our kids for continuing to fight through adversity, playing the next play. It was an ugly game on our part, but sometimes you got to win ugly and sometimes you got to find a way to win games, and we did that tonight."
 Ruder led the Indians with 16 points, scoring eight in the fourth quarter.
 "The way they were playing defense, they were really sagging off of her and left her open at the free-throw line," Porter said. "She was confident and made some big shots for us late in the game."
 The Indians nearly pitched a shutout in the first quarter before Great Bend hit a 3-pointer with five seconds left in the frame. The Panthers proceeded to hit five 3s in the second quarter to take a 23-14 lead into the break, but Hays held the Panthers without a 3 after halftime.
 "I thought we did a better job in the second half of contesting shots on the outside," Porter said.
 Great Bend went without a field goal in the fourth quarter. The Panthers were 5 of 11 from the foul line in the final frame.
 Porter credited his team's effort for scratching out a win.
 "I don't ever question this team's effort at all," Porter said. "Consistent effort is going to keep us in games. Tasiah did a great job tonight being a senior leader, leading with that kind of effort. She made a number of great plays and really helped our team out."
 The Indians will continue WAC play on Friday at Garden City.
 "To stay positive and be resilient through adversity, I think the next time we're in close games like this, we can look back and have some confidence that we can find a way to get it done," Porter said. "I think it gives us a little energy and gives us some positive momentum moving forward."

Usually, when I write for the Old Colony Memorial, I strive to find balance in my presentation so as not to offend those who lean right or left. With our country so politically divided, it is an extremely difficult task. This time, I simply give up.
 Back last August, the OCM published my Food For Thought piece titled "United We Stand, Divided We Fall." Although that article dealt with the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, the central issue remains the same today. As a nation, we are so politically divided that it has become impossible for us to come together. Whether it be foreign policy or domestic issues, we can't seem to resolve problems or present a united front to those who wish to do us harm.
 When it comes to someone as evil as Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, the fact that we can't speak with one voice is absolutely disgusting. Anyone who is responsible for the deaths of some 600 American soldiers, is an enemy of the American people. It doesn't matter whether we are on the left or right side of the political spectrum, he got what he so justly deserved. If he's now with his 17 virgins - good for him. At least he is no longer a threat to America or our people.
 And please, don't kid yourself. Whether you are on the left side or right side of the political spectrum, Soleimani considered you inhabitants of the Great Satan. The one thing we all have in common, as Americans, is that this terrible terrorist and his Quds associates, would have been happy to see you dead.
 We can score political points later. We can debate about the wisdom of the President's action in this regard in due course. For now, let's take a moment, as one united people, to recognize that an evil individual has been brought to his just demise. Celebrate our ability to track, target and eliminate him, without causing civilian casualties.
 Soleimani had become confident that the USA was impotent and lacked the fortitude to take him out. He traveled to Iraq to foment discord without the usual safeguards or operational security. His miscalculation resulted in him taking a hand gun to a Predator drone/Hellfire missile fight. Bye bye Soleimani. Good riddance!
 I am down in New Jersey today in support of my daughter who is recovering from an operation. On the way down, I was listening to Toby Keith sing, "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue." The words struck a chord and reminded me of Qasem Soleimani and a time after 9/11 when we were united.

 DUNDEE – James Edgar Knapp, age 90, of Dundee, N.Y. passed away Monday (January 13, 2020) in the comfort of his home with his family at his side. There are no prior calling hours. A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on Saturday (January 25) at the Barrington Community Church, Bath Rd., Dundee, N.Y. with Pastor Chuck Grant officiating.
