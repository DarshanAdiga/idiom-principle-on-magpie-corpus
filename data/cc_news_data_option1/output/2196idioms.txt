Terree, 70, worked for Kearney State Bank through its transition into Farmers & Merchants Bank for 30 years before retiring last Friday. She started as the assistant vice president and the Classic VIP Club director for both banks, but she finished as a vice president.
 The Classic VIP Club includes discounted travel opportunities for account holders who are 55 years or older. Through this program, Terree has directed tours to more than 80 countries and all seven continents.
 “We’ve seen several wonders of the world,” said Terree. “We’ve been to China and Cambodia-Vietnam and Thailand. Scandinavian countries, Russia, Austria, Switzerland, Germany — just tons.”
 Some of the memories Terree cherishes, include staying with farm families in Australia and New Zealand, seeing Machu Pichu and riding on 20-25 ocean cruises. She also enjoyed journeying through Thailand on elephants, basic river rafts and ox carts.
 Aside from the international opportunities, Terree also has explored most of the U.S.
 “We’ve seen lots of national parks,” said Terree. “We’ve traveled almost all 50 states, and we’ve seen as many of the state capitals as possible.”
 In the U.S., her tour groups have enjoyed nights in the Von Trapp Family Lodge, pitchfork fondue in South Dakota and sleigh rides in Yellowstone National Park through elk herds.
 Out of all of her travels, Africa is her favorite destination.
 There, Terree sang with the villagers, experienced gorilla trekking and rode in Jeeps and hot air balloons for safaris. During these safaris, she saw the “big five” animals, which are the lion, leopard, rhinoceros, elephant and Cape buffalo.
 However, the people are what stuck with her the most though.

Former India cricketer Yuvraj Singh posted a message on his Twitter account on Friday, apologizing for a comment he made on a live Instagram video chat with India opener Rohit Sharma that drew flak from critics who saw it as a casteist slur.
 "This is to clarify that I have never believed in any kind of disparity, be it on the basis of caste, colour, creed or gender. I have given and continue to spend my life for the welfare of people," read his message.
 "I understand that while I was having a conversation with my friends, I was misunderstood, which was unwarranted. However, as a responsible Indian I want to say that if I have unintentionally hurt anybody's sentiments or feelings, I would like to express regret for the same," Singh wrote in his message.
 Singh's conversation with Sharma took place last month and was followed by many cricket fans across the country. On India leg spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, Singh said, "Yeh bhangi logo ko koi kaam nahi hai, Yuzi (Yuzvendra) ko."
 The comment was supposed to be in jest, a reference to Chahal's social media antics, but the use of the term bhangi, a slur used against the Valmiki community, didn't exactly amuse people. Yuvraj couldn't be reached for comment.
 At the time he made the comment, not many seemed to have noticed Singh's use of the term. When some social media users highlighted that part of the conversation, many demanded an apology from Singh. It led to a Twitter trend in India - "Yuvraj Singh maafi mango" (Yuvraj Singh, apologise).
 To be sure, this is not the first time a celebrity has come under fire for using a casteist slur. In 2017, Bollywood actors Salman Khan and Shilpa Shetty drew public ire for similar remarks - the former described his dancing style as that of a 'bhangi', and the latter used the word to describe how she looked like at home.
 Another Bollywood star, Sonakshi Sinha, used the term during a radio interaction in July last year. She apologized after being called out.
 Bezwada Wilson, a social activist and co-founder of the Safai Karmachari Andolan (SKA), a movement dedicated to the eradication of manual scavenging, said the use of these terms has to do with a lack of awareness about caste.
 "The term 'bhangi' earlier was not specifically a caste but people who used to clean toilets," Wilson said. "Cleaning human excreta is not only seen as derogatory, but there is also the issue of untouchability. Since many were involved in manual scavenging, they were called 'bhangis'. And it gradually became a derogatory term. I have myself been called 'bhangi' in the past. People don't realise how problematic it is to use this term.
 The judiciary has also in the past tried to clamp down on the use of casteist slurs.
 In 2008, the Supreme Court had said using the term 'chamar' may be seen as a punishable offence under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.
 The apex court in 2017, while setting aside a Patna High Court decision to grant anticipatory bail to an accused facing charges under Section 3(1) of the SC/ST Act, also noted that use of casteist slurs like 'harijan' and 'dhobi' count as offensive language.
 "The problem is people who use these slurs are not respectful of these particular forms of labour," said Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd, a writer, academic and Dalit rights activist. "And we don't debate the caste system enough. Many Indian- Americans, for example, are supporting the Black Lives Matter movement in the US.
 "But they would never say anything about the Dalit movement here. What he (Yuvraj) said was wrong and it's good that he apologised. But let this debate go on," he added.

Where we live, June evenings bring fireflies - "lightning bugs" dancing their way across the starry background.      This is a real pleasure of stepping out on a clear night in June. The field we have out back, darkened by the night, would look like a field of stars if those fireflies would stand still. Instead they move about, blinking on and off, a show in my mind coupled with the constellations above, beats any man- made fireworks show.      One night I was looking through my reflecting telescope and a firefly entered through the open end of the tube. You can imagine the distraction!      The stars, though seemingly unchanging and still, looking as they did to our ancestors of old, aren't all that different than the firefly. Like this flashy insect, the stars actually are in constant motion, and many of them "blink" \- mostly at very slow rates (days, weeks, months) as they vary in magnitude.      The stars don't seem to be shifting because they are so immensely far. A few though, are crossing the heavenly sphere at a fast enough clip and are close enough, that a user of even a small telescope could trace its motion over a few years. One of the most famous is Barnard's Star, in Ophiucus.      As darkness falls in mid-June - once the moon is out of the way - look southeast for the large constellations Ophiucus and Serpens. Note: Serpens is broken in two, on either side of Ophiucus.      Ancient Greeks depicted Ophiucus as the renowned physican Aesculapius, the inventor and god of medicine, holding Serpens the Snake across his knees. Ophiucus is also depicted standing on Scorpius the Scorpion, the constellation immediately below it and marked with a fabulous, bright red star, Antares.      Dr. Ophiucus, I don't think, would be recognized by my health insurance plan.      Barnard's Star is of 9.5 magnitude, requiring a telescope of about 3-inch aperture or larger to easily see. You need a detailed star chart showing the myriad of similarly faint stars to track down which one is Barnard's Star.      Although appearing motionless in the eyepiece, if you were to take photographs or very carefully plot the stars on paper, you could repeat this in a few years and see that Barnard's Star has actually moved.      It was discovered by Professor Emerson Bernard in 1916. He noticed it had shifted by comparing his photographic plate with plates taken in 1894 and 1904.      The star has the highest proper motion of any star we see, moving at 10.3 "seconds of arc" per year.      (A degree on the sky, equal to about two full moons, is equivalent to 60 minutes of arc. Each minute has 60 seconds of arc.)      Barnard observed that in 22 years the star moved by four minutes of arc - about a third of the apparent separation of the famous double star Mizar and Alcor in the Big Dipper's handle.      Barnard's Star is a red dwarf star and only six light-years away, among the very closest. Astronomer Peter Van de Kamp, in 1963, had become convinced that an apparent wobble in the star's path was due to the gravitational pull of an unseen planet.      His assertion was not vindicated until 2018 when a planet, 3.2 times the size of Earth, was discovered orbiting the star.   Full moon is on June 6.      Keep looking up at the sky!

 Although this column only comes around once a month, it doesn't always fall near the holiday we are celebrating. I would not want to miss Memorial Day. It is so important that we pause to remember and honor those men and women who have given the ultimate sacrifice. They have protected us from harm and allowed us to live in this great land of freedom and liberty.
 The coronavirus has left us with a load of difficult questions that are going to require difficult decision making soon. Some of those difficult questions include the following:
 ‒Does the City reopen the pool this summer?
 ‒Do we hold the traditional 4th of July celebration with fireworks?
 ‒Does the City reopen the campground? Opening June 1 as per Governor's order.
 ‒What happens to Corn Days?
 Community leaders have been looking at these events with great care, balancing safety with the desire to continue our important community traditions. Recognizing that these events are important to this community's vitality, we will be looking ahead to the governor's decisions and the impact of his decisions on these events.
 I shared with you my concern a few weeks ago about what was happening with bond prices. Well, I'm very happy to share with you that my worry was for nothing. At the last City Council meeting, the Council was able to refinance current City and Hospital indebtedness, saving $546,000 over the life of those bonds. In addition, at a special meeting Wednesday May 27, the Council approved issuance of $8.8 million in new bonds to finance the City Street Reconstruction project and the 12th Avenue project, at a rate of 2.13%. We couldn't be happier with these rates. Bear in mind that a one half percent increase in those bond rates would cost the City $700,000 over the life of the bonds.
 The City Council also voted to go ahead with the flow study at the lake to begin this fall. This study should give us invaluable information that will help us make good future decisions about the lake. Seeing the popularity of the lake these days, it certainly speaks to the value of that asset to our community. The Water Resource Center from Minnesota State University, Mankato will be conducting the one year study.

 There was some confusion regarding filing for open positions on the Council and the mayor positions, thinking that deadline was approaching. However, that early deadline was only for communities that were holding a primary election. The actual deadline to file for those open positions is Sept. 4. Two Council positions (JoAnn Schmidt and Larry Braun) and the mayor's position (Wayne Pelzel) will be open.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Negotiators for the city of Minneapolis agreed with the state Friday to ban the use of chokeholds by police and to require officers to report and intervene anytime they see an unauthorized use of force by another officer.The changes are part of a stipulation posted online between the city and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, which launched a civil rights investigation this week in response to the death of George Floyd. The City Council was expected to approve the agreement Friday.The agreement would require court approval and would become enforceable in court, unlike the department's current policies on the use of force and duties to intervene. The agreement would require any officer, regardless of tenure or rank, to immediately radio or phone in from the scene the use of any neck restraint or chokehold to their commander or their commander’s superiors.Similarly, any officer who sees another officer commit any unauthorized use of force, including any chokehold or neck restraint, must try to intervene verbally and even physically. If they don’t, they’d be subject to discipline as severe as if they themselves had used the prohibited force.The agreement also would require authorization from the police chief or a designated deputy chief to use crowd control weapons, including chemical agents, rubber bullets, flash-bang grenades, batons, and marking rounds. And it would require more timely decisions on disciplining officers.Meanwhile, a man who was with George Floyd on the night he died told the New York Times his friend did not resist arrest and instead tried to defuse the situation before he ended up handcuffed on the ground and pleading for air as an officer pressed a knee against his neck.Maurice Lester Hall, a longtime friend of Floyd's, was a passenger in Floyd's car when police approached him May 25 as they responded to a call about someone using a forged bill at a shop. Hall told the newspaper that Floyd was trying to show he was not resisting.“I could hear him pleading, ‘Please, officer, what’s all this for?’” Hall told the Times.Hall is a key witness in the state’s investigation into the four officers who apprehended Floyd. Derek Chauvin, the white officer who continued pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck even after Floyd became motionless, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. The three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting. All four officers were fired.Hall's identity wasn't made public until the Times' report.Hall told “Good Morning America” that the situation escalated quickly and police grabbed Floyd, put him in a squad car, dragged him back out and then “jumped on the back of the neck.” He said Floyd was put in an ambulance and that he didn’t know his friend had died until the next day, when he saw the widely viewed bystander video on Facebook.“He was just crying out at that time for anyone to help because he was dying,” Hall told the Times. “I’m going to always remember seeing the fear in Floyd’s face because he’s such a king. That’s what sticks with me, seeing a grown man cry, before seeing a grown man die.”Hall, 42, said he visited a memorial for Floyd and then hitchhiked to Houston, where he was arrested Monday on outstanding warrants for felony possession of a firearm, felony domestic assault and felony drug possession. After his arrest, a Minnesota investigator interviewed him for hours about Floyd’s death. His attorney said he has since been released on the warrant issue.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

If the season is played out behind-closed-doors, Sunderland had originally proposed only to offer season card holders a pass to stream those games at home on a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone.
 The same approach was taken to 2020-21, with fans told that if any home games next season are played behind-closed-doors, a streaming pass would be issed rather than a refund.
 Supporters were furious that they were not given a choice of a refund for games they will not be allowed attend, nor was there a plan to offer even a part-refund to represent the price difference between a streaming pass and the amount they have paid per game when buying a season card.
 But following an immediate backlash, yesterday chief executive Jim Rodwell promised to listen to feedback from fans and laid the groundwork for a change of tack.
 And in an open letter to fans today, Rodwell has told fans they will be refunded if the season is completed behind-closed-doors.
 The club still intends to offer season card holders a streaming pass rather than a refund for any games that are played behind-closed-doors next season.
 But the decision to allow any fans who have already paid for a 2020-21 card a full refund means they can now decide whether or not they want to go ahead with their purchase on those terms.
 The club has already said that the early bird prices will remain in force until further notice, and season card holders who do not renew will not lose their seats as they will be reserved until further notice.
 Fans who opt not to buy a season card at this stage will be able to stream games on a match-by-match basis, and if the 2020-21 season starts behind- closed-doors the club will offer a part-season ticket as soon as supporters are allowed back in the ground.
 Only those who want to renew and spread the cost using the club's direct debit instalment scheme will not have that flexibility, with the deadline for signup to that plan remaining June 11.
 Rodwell's letter reads: "Following Wednesday's season card announcement, we have listened carefully to your feedback and I wanted to update you on several points.
 "We remain hopeful that the 2019-20 season will be played, but in addition to our commitment to refund supporters if it is curtailed, you will also have the option of a refund should the season conclude behind closed doors.
 "We also appreciate that many of you have already paid in full for next season and that our communication in this instance should have been clearer.
 "To clarify, if you have already purchased a 2020-21 season card, you will be able to obtain a refund should you wish to do so.
 "Whilst we remain in a healthy financial position, season card revenue will be key when budgeting for next season and like all clubs, it is very important that we generate any additional income we can in these uncertain times.

For the first time in at least 20 years, it would appear Florida Democrats are going to field candidates in all 140 state legislative races.
   
 Among recent filers are challengers to powerful Republican incumbents Sen. Travis Hutson of St. Augustine and Rep. Tom Leek of Ormond Beach.
   
 Hutson, who chairs an appropriations subcommittee on transportation, tourism and economic development, will be on the ballot opposite Heather Hunter, a 22-year-old recent Flagler College graduate who interned with the Democratic Environmental Caucus of Florida and lives in Tallahassee.
   
 And in Florida House District 25 -- where Leek is completing his second two- year term as chair of the House Public Integrity and Ethics Committee -- Libertarian Joe Hannoush will be joined on the ballot by Sarah Zutter, 22, of Port Orange. She is a recent graduate of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University who's been politically active since 2016.
   
 Neither Hunter nor Zutter has reported raising any money, other than to pay a qualifying fee of about $1,800. Qualifying for most state and local candidates is next week.
   
 That can't compete with Hutson and Leek, each of whom had at least $140,000 in cash on hand, according to their most recent campaign finance reports, and that's not including money in their political committees.
   
 Since April 1, Janelle Christensen, president of the Democratic Environmental Caucus, led the effort to recruit 33 candidates for state legislative races that had not yet involved a Democrat.
   
 "I think that the party feels that Democratic ideas need to be voiced in every corner of the state," Christensen said. "If we had those 33 seats vacant, that's nearly one-third of the state where we are not raising the issues the Democratic Party stands for."
   
 Despite Florida being a state that has more registered Democrats than Republicans, the GOP has controlled the House, Senate and governor's office for more than 20 years.
   
 Christensen said she partnered with Dr. William "Fergie" Reid, who in 1967 became the first African-American to be elected to the Virginia Assembly since the Reconstruction, and his son, Dr. William "Fergie" Reid Jr., to get candidates for every seat in that state's election. Democrats won the Virginia House in 2019, giving them control of the House, Senate and governor's office for the first time since 1994.
   
 Not all the candidates are newbies like Hunter and Zutter.
   
 "We have a really wide mix. I would say that most of them are involved in the environmental caucus," Christensen said. "There are a lot of veterans running and there are some retirees."
   
 She acknowledged that many of the 33 are in safe-red districts.
   
 "Maybe they know this is a long shot, but they're building up their name and their experience in the local committees," Christensen said. "These are some people who took on tough races because they do have ambitions in the future."
   
 It's going to take changes to raise Democrats' prospects in Florida, which has been redistricted twice by Republicans, and will be again in 2021, following the release of this year's census.
   
 Greg Koger, professor and chair of political science at the University of Miami, said the effort to recruit candidates makes sense for two reasons.
   
 "Some incumbents are weaker than might be expected," Koger said, "and long- shot victories can happen."
   
 Also, it means candidates such as Hutson and Leek will have to use more of their resources.
   
 "It forces every incumbent to defend himself or herself. The focus will be on their own races," Koger said. "They won't be raising money and reallocating it to other races that are considered close."
   
 Hunter was born in Daytona Beach and says she will -- as the law requires -- move back to the area if she wins. She campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and local candidates in 2018.
   
 She's particularly concerned with criminal justice reform and protecting Florida's environment.
   
 "We don't believe anybody should just be able to walk into office," Hunter said. "We think we can win. This year has been very crazy and you never know what's going to happen."
   
 Hutson said he doesn't know much about Hunter, but says he takes the challenge seriously.
   
 "I think were going to campaign and not take anything lightly or for granted," he said. "Obviously our numbers in (2016), we did really well, but in the last few years a lot of people have moved into the district. ... We are going to be running as if it's the first time we ran."
   
 Zutter, who also worked for the Clinton campaign and organized a women's march in Daytona Beach in 2019, was an intern for former Sen. Bill Nelson in Orlando in 2018. She was also president of Embry-Riddle's chapter of the Florida College Democrats.
   
 "I just think I'm able to talk to voters directly," Zutter said. "I'm fighting for them and want to represent them as their direct representative, which is something that crosses party lines and resonates with people."
   
 Leek said he welcomes the challenge.
   
 "I love to see people at that age getting involved," Leek said. "(My 2018 opponent) Katie Tripp was a great opponent. She made me a better candidate."
   
 Koger said the experience of running for office at a young age, even in a losing battle, can be useful for candidates such as Hunter and Zutter.
   
 "The experience of running for (office) is something they can use in their later lives," Koger said. "Even if they lose an election, the Democrats can see people who did better than expected."
   
 Beyond that, Christensen believes fielding candidates statewide sends a strong message.
   
 When she first moved to largely Republican Lee County, she said she learned that a lot of Democrats there had registered with the GOP just to "have a voice" in local politics.
   
 An effort to recruit more candidates in 2018 increased Democratic turnout by 3%, she said.
   
 "There were people to vote for down ballot," she said. "We have to do everything we can to let every Floridian know they have a choice."

Former India cricketer Yuvraj Singh posted a message on his Twitter account on Friday, apologizing for a comment he made on a live Instagram video chat with India opener Rohit Sharma that drew flak from critics who saw it as a casteist slur.
 "This is to clarify that I have never believed in any kind of disparity, be it on the basis of caste, colour, creed or gender. I have given and continue to spend my life for the welfare of people," read his message.
 "I understand that while I was having a conversation with my friends, I was misunderstood, which was unwarranted. However, as a responsible Indian I want to say that if I have unintentionally hurt anybody's sentiments or feelings, I would like to express regret for the same," Singh wrote in his message.
 Singh's conversation with Sharma took place last month and was followed by many cricket fans across the country. On India leg spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, Singh said, "Yeh bhangi logo ko koi kaam nahi hai, Yuzi (Yuzvendra) ko."
   
   
 The comment was supposed to be in jest, a reference to Chahal's social media antics, but the use of the term bhangi, a slur used against the Valmiki community, didn't exactly amuse people. Yuvraj couldn't be reached for comment.
 At the time he made the comment, not many seemed to have noticed Singh's use of the term. When some social media users highlighted that part of the conversation, many demanded an apology from Singh. It led to a Twitter trend in India - "Yuvraj Singh maafi mango" (Yuvraj Singh, apologise).
 To be sure, this is not the first time a celebrity has come under fire for using a casteist slur. In 2017, Bollywood actors Salman Khan and Shilpa Shetty drew public ire for similar remarks - the former described his dancing style as that of a 'bhangi', and the latter used the word to describe how she looked like at home.
 Another Bollywood star, Sonakshi Sinha, used the term during a radio interaction in July last year. She apologized after being called out.
 Bezwada Wilson, a social activist and co-founder of the Safai Karmachari Andolan (SKA), a movement dedicated to the eradication of manual scavenging, said the use of these terms has to do with a lack of awareness about caste.
 "The term 'bhangi' earlier was not specifically a caste but people who used to clean toilets," Wilson said. "Cleaning human excreta is not only seen as derogatory, but there is also the issue of untouchability. Since many were involved in manual scavenging, they were called 'bhangis'. And it gradually became a derogatory term. I have myself been called 'bhangi' in the past. People don't realise how problematic it is to use this term.
 The judiciary has also in the past tried to clamp down on the use of casteist slurs.
 In 2008, the Supreme Court had said using the term 'chamar' may be seen as a punishable offence under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.
 The apex court in 2017, while setting aside a Patna High Court decision to grant anticipatory bail to an accused facing charges under Section 3(1) of the SC/ST Act, also noted that use of casteist slurs like 'harijan' and 'dhobi' count as offensive language.
 "The problem is people who use these slurs are not respectful of these particular forms of labour," said Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd, a writer, academic and Dalit rights activist. "And we don't debate the caste system enough. Many Indian- Americans, for example, are supporting the Black Lives Matter movement in the US.
 "But they would never say anything about the Dalit movement here. What he (Yuvraj) said was wrong and it's good that he apologised. But let this debate go on," he added.

We hear and read stories such as "Real Wage Growth Is Actually Falling" and "Since 2000 Wage Growth Has Barely Grown." But we should not believe it. Ask yourself, "What is the total compensation that I receive from my employer?" If you included only your money wages, you would be off the mark anywhere between 30% and 38%. Total employee compensation includes mandated employer expenses such as Social Security and Medicare. Other employee benefits include retirement and health care benefits as well as life insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance, vacation leave, tuition reimbursement and bonuses. There is incentive for people to want more of their compensation in a noncash form simply because of the different tax treatment. The bottom line is that prior to the government shutdown of our economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Americans were becoming richer and richer. The question before us now is how to get back on that path.

The Dollar General Literacy Foundation recently gave Literacy Volunteers of America – Prince William Inc. a $5,000 grant to support its ESL and Job Readiness for New Immigrants program.
 This grant is part of more than $8.6 million awarded to more than 950 schools, nonprofits, and organizations across the communities Dollar General serves.
 The ESL and Job Readiness for New Immigrants program is projected to address the needs of over 350 adult learners to help improve English literacy, work- related vocabulary, and job readiness skills across Prince William County, said Deborah Abbott, executive director of the Literacy Volunteers of America- Prince William.
 “Our goal with this funding is to help at least 120 adult learners gain the skills to find a job, transition from part-time to full-time employment, or obtain a promotion or better job," she added. "This is particularly important with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as many of our adults have lost jobs or hours. Dollar General’s support will enable LVA-PW to transition our award- winning program to offer distance learning options to our adult learners in the hope of helping those who most in need navigate a path forward during these challenging times.”
 The organization offers tuition-free classes throughout Prince William to help low-income adults with families to find sustainable local jobs to become financially self-sufficient. Dollar General’s support will help recruit and train 30 new tutors, support additional in-house professional development, and expand classroom and one-on-one instruction offerings.
 “During these extraordinary times, the Dollar General Literacy Foundation remains steadfast in its commitment to support communities’ literacy and educational advancements through funds that will impact thousands of students across the country,” said Todd Vasos, Dollar General’s CEO and Dollar General Literacy Foundation board member.
 Since its inception in 1993, the Dollar General Literacy Foundation has awarded more than $182 million in grants to nonprofit organizations.
 Literacy Volunteers of America - Prince William is an adult literacy nonprofit organization that has served Prince William for over 29 years. The organization offers classes to low-income adults in basic reading and writing, English as a Second Language (ESL), GED preparation, civics and citizenship, computer training, workforce development and an innovative confidence course.

So I think like if somebody would tell me we had to do this for the next six months to a year without a face-to-face meeting, they told me that three months ago I would say, Jesus, absolutely no way like that's not the way I sold in my career. Now I actually believe we could do it. Yeah, there are challenges and there are adjustments we have to make and there's no real substitute to face-to-face, but I think people tend to be more efficient. We get right, I'm probably not making, yeah, I was going to say we get to the point faster which the way I'm answering this question might not speak volumes about that, but it does get to the point a lot faster with these Zoom meetings. You're not just hanging around, you're not going out for drinks or dinners or sitting on a plane or a subway or a bus. You're taught when you're working you're working and it's very-- it can be very effective. So, yeah, I think we've learned a lot. And I actually believe that we could conduct business like this for a long time if we had to.

I shared with you my concern a few weeks ago about what was happening with bond prices. Well, I'm very happy to share with you that my worry was for nothing. At the last City Council meeting, the Council was able to refinance current City and Hospital indebtedness, saving $546,000 over the life of those bonds. In addition, at a special meeting Wednesday May 27, the Council approved issuance of $8.8 million in new bonds to finance the City Street Reconstruction project and the 12th Avenue project, at a rate of 2.13%. We couldn't be happier with these rates. Bear in mind that a one half percent increase in those bond rates would cost the City $700,000 over the life of the bonds.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — A $33 billion Louisiana operating budget that would keep most programs and services from cuts in the upcoming financial year thanks to federal coronavirus aid started advancing Friday in the House of Representatives. The spending proposal backed by the House Appropriations Committee doesn't account for millions of dollars in business tax breaks that lawmakers are considering in their ongoing special session, which could siphon dollars away from the treasury that the budget anticipates spending. The 2020-21 budget proposal charts spending for the financial year that starts July 1, following plans largely recommended by Gov. John Bel Edwards. After making modest changes from the Democratic governor's recommendations, the committee agreed to the bill without objection, sending it to the full House for debate Wednesday. Louisiana's child welfare and food stamp agency, K-12 public school financing formula and the TOPS college tuition program would avoid reductions. Hospitals could see sizable increases in Medicaid dollars from a new payment plan that still needs federal approval. College campuses, health programs and some other agencies would take some cuts. Lawmakers began work on the budget in the regular session that ended Monday but didn’t complete, so they had to restart the effort in the special session. Among the largest changes made by the Appropriations Committee, lawmakers steered $7 million to increase funding to Louisiana's public defenders, who said the state's defense system for the poor was at risk of collapse without an infusion of stopgap aid. Public defenders said their 42 offices needed extra state support because local dollars they receive from court fines and traffic fees dried up as the coronavirus shuttered courts for months and kept drivers off the roads.

Last week, George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis, Minnesota, died after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly 9 minutes. His death has ignited anger and has been the catalyst for protests around our country, some right here in the First Congressional District. I completely understand why this incident is so painful for so many in our country.
 George Floyd was murdered in broad daylight by an officer of the law. The video leaves no room for doubt. Mr. Floyd’s family has every reason to demand justice for the death of their beloved family member. Those responsible for this tragedy must be brought to account, and I was glad to see Minnesota officials move swiftly towards justice, charging this officer with murder.
 I grew up in the rural, segregated south in Stewart County, Tennessee. I was a medical student in Memphis when Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. Out of all this pain, I’ve seen – and am incredibly proud of – the progress we’ve made toward equality in this country. When my mother passed several years ago, the pastor at her church, an African-American woman, spoke at her funeral, and no one thought of anything of it.
 That would have been unheard of a generation before. We should acknowledge and celebrate the progress our country has made towards equality. At the same time, Mr. Floyd’s death leaves no doubt that our nation has a long, difficult journey ahead. We all need to understand that our segregated past still inflicts deep pain and recommit ourselves towards equal justice under the law.
 As sickening as this killing is, it is also not representative of our law enforcement community. The overwhelming majority of officers are men and women of the highest character who do an incredible job protecting and serving our communities every day. I continually see the hard work our police officers do in East Tennessee, and I am confident that they want officers like this who engage in wrongdoing brought to justice for their actions.
 Our law enforcement community has been put under incredible stress trying to keep the peace over the last week, as they’ve been subjected to assault, verbal abuse, harassment, and – tragically – some have been killed in the line of duty. I’m proud of the work they are doing to ensure our communities remain safe, and I thank them and their families for the sacrifices they’re making on our behalf.
 The First Amendment gives Americans the right to peaceful protests, and many over the past several days – including protests in East Tennessee – have indeed been nonviolent. But rioting, looting, and arson are not free speech.
 Seeing the destruction being caused by some protestors who appear bent on nothing more than anarchy is deeply upsetting and frightening to many. In cities around the country, we’ve seen businesses of all sizes and types looted and burned. We cannot tolerate lawlessness. There is no justification for this destruction. We must restore law and order. Now.
 This weekend, we are honoring the 76th anniversary of D-Day, when Allied troops bravely stormed the beaches of Normandy. These heroes fought for our freedoms – including our right to peacefully assemble – and we owe them an eternal debt of gratitude for their sacrifice.
 Last weekend, rioters shamefully vandalized the World War II Memorial on the National Mall and other sites dedicated to our nation’s veterans. This is an affront to them and to the memory of all who have served. The destruction of homes, businesses, places of worship, and national monuments cannot continue.
 Over the weekend, before the historic space launch in Florida, President Trump offered uplifting words of sympathy and allyship for Mr. Floyd’s family and condemnation for the rioting. I encourage you to read his statement here if you haven’t seen it already.
 Finally, we must also be mindful that the coronavirus crisis is not over. It is troubling that so many protestors have been out in our streets without taking precautions against the virus, like social distancing and wearing masks.
 Those involved in protests should probably get tested to stop needless spread, because right now our country needs to reopen and get our economy back on track. Many of our friends and neighbors are still struggling even as our state has started carefully reopening over the past month, and it will help no one if protestors’ actions worsen our public health crisis.
 Our country’s progress will continue, and we must all do our part to help it heal.
