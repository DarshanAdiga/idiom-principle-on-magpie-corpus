The Centers for Disease Control said to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus during trick-or-treating, individually bagged treats should be given outdoors, with frequent handwashing or sanitizing. You should stay at least six feet apart from people that don't live with you. Cloth masks should be worn as part of a costume, not under a costume mask, because that could make breathing more difficult. And anyone who has COVID-19 or may have been exposed to the virus should not hand out candy or go trick-or-treating.
 For people who want low-risk ways to celebrate Halloween, the CDC recommends pumpkin carving with household members, decorating your house or watching scary movies at home with family.
 At the Ultimate Party Store in Denham Springs, assistant manager Theresa Wiley said she‚Äôs seen a sharp increase in business. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre selling twice as much as we did last year,‚Äù she said. Costumes are big sellers, especially those related to the Toy Story movies, she said.
 Kirt Barnett, who was shopping at Party Time with his daughters, Katie and Kennedy, said his family would mark Halloween like they normally do. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to go trick-or-treating in the neighborhood for about an hour,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to have any parties because they‚Äôre young.‚Äù

 When Ross retires from his work with Cooper when he‚Äôs 8 or 10 years old, the family will have the option of keeping him, even as they get another, younger dog to be Cooper‚Äôs companion.

 # Sex offender in Eugene sentenced to federal prison for failing to register
 Jordyn Brown
 Register-Guard
 A sex offender who was arrested in Eugene in November was sentenced to time in federal prison Thursday for failing to comply with supervision and registration requirements.
 Eugene police found Robert John Golom, 27, in an encampment in a tent with a 16-year-old girl on Nov. 5, 2019. He was arrested and charged in U.S. District Court in Eugene on Nov. 14.
 He was sentenced this week to five years in federal prison and 10 years of supervised release for failure to register as a sex offender.
 Golom, of Washington County, Utah, has previous convictions in Utah for sexual exploitation of a minor and unlawful sexual contact with a 16- or 17-year-old in 2019, according to a Thursday news release from U.S. Marshal Bryon Carroll and the District of Oregon's U.S. Attorney's Office.
 "Golom was also found in possession of a machete, a concealed hunting knife and other makeshift weapons," the release stated.
 Law enforcement said Golom told them he left Utah on a bus, fleeing his court- ordered supervision and sex offender registration requirements in Utah, and traveled to Oregon. He was living in Oregon for a month before being found by police, but he did not register as a sex offender in Oregon, according to an affidavit filed in federal court.
 Golom pleaded guilty in July and was sentenced on Thursday.
 The U.S. Marshals Service and Oregon State Police investigated the case, along with Eugene police.

The H9G is an upper-mid-range TV that offers terrific picture quality but leaves off the cutting-edge features touted by some of the best TVs we've seen this year from TCL and Vizio. This quantum dot equipped model delivers an exceptionally bright picture with superb color, but if you're hoping for future-proof features that will keep it ahead of the curve for years to come, you might want to look elsewhere. In other words, the H9G is a great TV if what you're after is a terrific, bright picture, but a less-than-ideal pick if you're a gamer (or if you just want to lock down some exciting future-proofing features).

The bottom-line benefits to listening to your customers, for a company that went public only a month-and-change ago, likely played a part in Spotify's announcement, too. Rohit Deshpande, a Harvard marketing professor, pointed to another example, from this year, of an industry leader staking out a moral position: the largest investment management group in the world, BlackRock. In his annual letter, CEO Larry Fink wrote that his company, which manages $6.2 trillion in assets, would begin to consider the social footprint of the companies it holds stakes in. Fink wrote that "society increasingly is turning to the private sector and asking that companies respond to broader societal challenges. Indeed, the public expectations of your company have never been greater. Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society." As with Spotify, BlackRock's position was criticized. Would they ask Philip Morris to stop making cigarettes, or Coca-Cola to stop selling sugar water? It's a response that boils down, in essence, to the notion that engagement with social reality is a slippery slope for a business.

It's not a policy that's abnormal in say, a corporation. What the slippery slope there is, and what people are misconstruing, is that it's somehow their muting expression, that it's censorship.

The school buildings in Evanston, Illinois, are still empty. But the district‚Äôs recently hired superintendent caused a stir during a public Zoom meeting announcing how the they will decide which students get priority seating when in-person learning resumes.
 ‚ÄúWe have to make sure that students, who have been oppressed, that we don‚Äôt continue to oppress them, and we give them opportunity,‚Äù said school superintendent Dr. Devon Horton of the Evanston/Skokie school district in late July.
 ‚ÄúWe will be targeting our dependent learners ‚Äì those are students who are marginalized first,‚Äù he said.
 Low-income students, special needs and those dealing with homelessness are just some who will be first in line. There have been angry letters, petitions and even death threats to the superintendent and school board.
 ‚ÄúUnderstanding that other folks are experiencing more vulnerability and more harm than my family is experiencing,‚Äù says Anya Tanyavutti, a parent of two and the Evanston district‚Äôs school board president. ‚ÄúI'm happy to see those resources go to people who need it more.‚Äù
 For the last four years, the Evanston school district has been working on implementing anti-racism resolutions and curricula to address inequity.
 ‚ÄúTaking an anti-racist stance requires some sort of sacrifice,‚Äù says Dr. Onnie Rogers a professor at Northwestern University‚Äôs school of Education and Social Policy. ‚ÄúI think that's really the part of racial equity that our country is still getting used to on the ground.‚Äù
 Here in Evanston, the achievement gap does fall along racial lines where Black and Latino students are one-third as likely as white students to meet college readiness benchmarks.
 The district acknowledges that its plan to allow some students to return before others falls mostly along racial lines. But it is need, they say, not race, that will be the determining factor.
 ‚ÄúIf we simply said we're gonna just reopen for whoever wants to come, then the people who are most well-resourced and most well-connected would likely be able to get those seats prior to people who are challenged with homelessness or challenged with getting food on the table,‚Äù says Tanyavutti.
 And there has been opposition. Arlington, Virginia, based ‚ÄòStudents for Fair Admissions‚Äô- a non-profit advocacy group that has mounted legal challenges to affirmative action, has called the district‚Äôs plan unconstitutional.
 ‚ÄúIf that student has unique special needs then that's fine to take those into consideration,‚Äù says Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions. ‚ÄúWhat is not fine to take into consideration is the skin color or ethnic heritage of students.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIt has been legally reviewed, and I am confident that we are operating within the bounds of our Constitution,‚Äù says Tanyavutti.
 In-person learning is tentatively scheduled to resume in mid-November. And while the district says it will accommodate as many students as possible the priority remains their most vulnerable student population.

What makes a marketing technology valuable is a question that marketers, analysts, entrepreneurs and enthusiasts grapple with on a regular basis. In most instances, there is no single answer but rather a case-by-case evaluation. But what if some technologies really are more valuable than others?
 With constant change being the only certainty today and almost everything we are familiar with coming into question, businesses are adopting new processes, ideas and technologies at breakneck speed. Choosing what tool to reach for first in this environment has become crystal clear: the technology that brings the most value out of your data is the one you want first.
 Don‚Äôt agree? Look no further than recent developments in the martech world to get confirmation. Today, more than ever, marketing technologies‚Äô value is directly correlated to their ability to leverage data in different ways.
 Think about Twilio‚Äôs recent acquisition of customer data platform provider Segment, where Jeff Lawson, co-founder and CEO of Twilio stated ‚Äúdata silos destroy great customer experiences.‚Äù Or Salesforce‚Äôs acquisition of Evergage earlier this year, aimed to improve website content personalization based on the realtime capture of customer behavioral data during a visit.

Hurricane Zeta ripped through the New Orleans area just days before the Nov. 3 presidential election, and officials on Thursday raced to survey the damage to polling places, warehouses full of voting machines and the offices of local election officials.
 Zeta, a Category 2 hurricane when it made landfall Wednesday afternoon, slammed into New Orleans and knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses.
 Officials said Entergy would work to restore power first to polling precincts to get them up and running by Tuesday, when voters are expected to turn out in strong numbers to vote for president, Congressional races, New Orleans district attorney and a host constitutional amendments and propositions.
 State and local officials in the New Orleans area said they were still trying to figure out which polling locations might have to be moved on election day-- and were crafting plans for how to best inform voters.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hoping to minimize the number of voters who cannot vote at their normal location,‚Äù Gov. John Bel Edwards said at a morning press briefing before touring storm-ravaged southeast Louisiana. He added polling places and local elections offices will be ‚Äúpriority locations‚Äù for restoring power.

Price: I always purchase used, so for new, I'd cap the price at $2,000 and for used, I'd cap it at $500. Basically, if anything new is recommended, I'll wait 2-3 years to purchase it for $500, but I'd rather know about it now because it may be forgotten about by this forum in 2-3 years as new printers hit the market.

"About a week after my second child was born, my 17-month-old son Chris was diagnosed with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Chris felt terrible; the only thing that would comfort him was constantly being held‚Äîuntil we introduced him to Alexa. We‚Äôve spent much of Chris‚Äôs last two years in the hospital, and Alexa has provided Chris and our family with hope, fun, and dancing (for the nurses and doctors too).
 While many days are rough, we often wake up dancing and smiling with Alexa. Alexa says goodnight to Chris. She‚Äôs our fifth family member, and we take her everywhere, even on vacation. Alexa is comforting; we can listen to music, play games, and read stories.
 It‚Äôs very routine and mundane sitting in a hospital room for so long, but the hospital allowed us to take Alexa with us and we were able to change up the day with a story, something different, or bedtime music. I never thought caring for a child with pediatric cancer and Alexa would mix, but Alexa has been critical in our lives."

Despite pressure from the travel industry, Britain still requires travelers from most countries to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival, making most business and leisure travel impractical.


  "The U.K.'s hub airport is no longer the busiest airport in Europe, competitors such as Charles de Gaulle have exceeded us in terms of passenger numbers as they benefit from a testing regime," Heathrow said in a statement. "Without a rapid move to testing, the U.K. will fall even further behind its European competitors and the economic recovery will fail to get off the ground."


  Heathrow on Wednesday reported a pre-tax loss of 1.52 billion pounds ($1.97 billion) for the first nine months of the year, compared with a loss of 76 million pounds in the same period of 2019. Revenue plunged 59% to 2.3 billion pounds.


  The number of passengers using Heathrow during those nine months fell 69% to 19 million.
