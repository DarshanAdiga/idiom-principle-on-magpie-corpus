"However, while the recession looks to have been brief, the scars are likely to be deep. Even with the July rebound there's a long way to go before the output lost to the pandemic is regained and, while businesses grew more optimistic about the year ahead, a V-shaped recovery is by no means assured."

Some scientists believe that the flow of the Ganga has been reduced from Barh to Farakka while others say the flow has been reduced from Buxar onwards. The capacity of the tributaries like Kosi and Gandak has been reduced in tandem because the Ganga cannot accept the water brought by them just as it is difficult to enter a Second Class railway coach that is already full. No wonder, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been seeking a reassessment of the relevance of Farakka Barrage.

Another installment in The Cape Codder's annual Summer of Hope fundraising campaign on behalf of Lower Cape Outreach Council. LCOC is based in Orleans and serves the eight towns of the Lower and Outer Cape. Donations can be made at lcoutreach.org.
 The childhood summer visits to Cape Cod that Nancy enjoyed with her family gave her a love of the sea and of fishing. Her dream to live on the Cape and make her living from the sea was finally realized several years ago. She moved to the Outer Cape and fished in and around Cape waters for the next couple of years.
 But circumstances arose that made it necessary for her to leave her employer and she decided it was the perfect time to realize her life's ambition and open her own business.
 Nancy also was wild-harvesting shellfish for others as a self-employed fisherman, but realized she needed to do her own shellfish farm to make a viable living. She got a $1,000 SBA loan to help purchase some of her gear and she carefully researched the best price options before purchasing. Just as she was finalizing her license to set up,COVID-19 hit and the market for oysters-- at least for smaller harvesting operations--shut down.
 She could not harvest enough clams to make ends meets.
 "Clams move better because, even if people can't open them, they can steam them, make them into chowder or add to other dishes. Oysters are trickier to use if they are not freshly opened. Add to this that seventy percent of my business was to small restaurants."
 She avowedly had "never asked for help before COVID hit us. I had personal life stresses along with financial worries and was very anxious about bills piling up."
 At the same time she was unable to set up her new fishing business. She had just ordered her gear and shellfish seed and was in the process of getting everything in order when she lost virtually all her income and licenses were put on hold.
 In April, she contacted Lower Cape Outreach Council for some help. They provided some money towards her auto insurance and some towards a service bill that she had to keep her truck on the road.
 "The help I received from them speaks to the tightness and compassion of the Outer Cape and Cape Cod in general. Everyone looks out for each other. I have lived elsewhere and have not found that to be the case. The LCOC has a huge part of supporting people in the community. Shellfishing became my world when I moved here. Fishing has always been my dream. The help from LCOC means I can hang on until things open up and I can get back to business."

There is a possibility Hanna will reach hurricane strength just before landfall. If an eyewall begins to form, it would likely be near hurricane strength at landfall, the hurricane center says.
   
 Regardless of hurricane strength or not, Hanna will deliver strong winds, a strong storm surge and expansive rainfall.
   
 A Hurricane Warning has been issued from Baffin Bay northward to Mesquite Bay, Texas.
   
 A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande to Baffin Bay and from Mesquite Bay to San Luis Pass. Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area

PanCare of Florida would like to clear up any misconceptions regarding our COVID-19 testing data as it appears that the Florida Department of Health has misdirected their data collection process as an inaccuracy on PanCare's part.
   
 Since the onset of COVID-19 cases in Florida, PanCare of Florida, Inc., a non- profit organization, has been at the forefront of testing efforts in our nine- county service area. Our efforts have remained true as we have continued to keep the best interest of all people in our communities as our primary focus, we understand that local County Health Department directives come from the State level; however, data inaccuracies are not the fault of PanCare. With every effort we have made to improve and increase testing in our communities, we have been met with resistance and a constant uphill battle from both the State Department of Health and our local County Health Department.
   
 Throughout our COVID-19 testing efforts, we have utilized three methods for testing, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), COVID-19 IgM/IgG Antibody, and Sofia SARS Antigen FIA, all of which at their time of use had FDA-EUA approval.
   
 The State Department of Health advised PanCare that they would not include our results in with the case data reported on Florida's COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard in spite of FDA-EUA approval.
   
 On June 8, at a meeting held between PanCare administrators, DOH-Bay administrator, DOHBay Epidemiological APRN, and other county decision-makers, an agreement was made that PanCare would report to DOH-Bay, "all negative antigen tests, the number of negative antigen tests who do not take a PCR test, and the number of negative antigen tests who take a PCR test whose results are inconclusive. DOH will continue to treat positive antigen tests as a positive result, including notification, contact investigation, etc., and research why antigen positives are not considered a positive result instead of a "presumptive" positive."
   
 PanCare has complied with all terms of this agreement.
   
 In an interview on July 2, with local news outlets, DOH-Bay stated that the reason results for Antigen tests were not updated for the public was because they had to develop a system for reporting, this was not true.
   
 On July 1, the Department of Health released another update on their reporting processes, and we worked with the Florida Department of Health (FL-DOH) to implement a new electronic reporting process that is compatible with their system.
   
 As of July 16, FL-DOH has approved the system integration, and numbers we have previously reported have started being reflected in their data.
   
 We PanCareFL.org will continue to electronically submit our positive and negative test results directly to the Florida Department of Health via this integrated system.
   
 All Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests conducted at our testing sites are sent to a third-party lab for molecular confirmation. We have sent over 6,000 PCR tests to MedComp Sciences, Quest Diagnostics, and Genetworx, all results of these tests have been reported throughout the entire pandemic directly to the State Department of Health from those labs.
   
 To date, PanCare of Florida has spent in excess of $1.5 million on COVID-19 testing throughout our nine-county service area.
   
 In short, yes the COVID-19 data for the State of Florida is skewed, PanCare has conducted over 6,900 antibody tests, and over 16,000 antigen tests that have not been accurately reported by the Florida Department of Health because they refused to accept the results of both of these FDA-EUA approved tests at the time they were administered.
   
 We empathize with other organizations throughout the state that have worked tirelessly to provide testing in their communities that have continued to go through the hurdles that we have experienced. We will continue to report our daily results and look forward to seeing an accurate depiction of the testing efforts made daily by all COVID-19 testing organizations throughout Florida.
   
 Sincerely,
   
 R. Michael Hill
   
 President & CEO PanCare of Florida, Inc.

Miss Alice Ward gave my first wife a bag of garden fresh vine ripe tomatoes. I ate a tomato sandwich just as fast as Cathy could get one out of the sack. And thought about my Dad…..
   
 He was a meat and potatoes guy. He wanted bacon and eggs for breakfast and roast beef, chicken and lots of vegetables the rest of the day. He didn't eat sandwiches. As little kids we marveled that he wasn't even fond of hamburgers.
   
 But a perfectly ripe tomato sandwich was the exception. I can see Dad right now sitting in his "place" at that red-topped Formica kitchen table. He would swab a boatload of Miracle Whip salad dressing on two pieces of Colonial Bread, pile three or four slices of tomatoes in between and eat….for a while!
   
 I silently thanked Miss Alice for the memory.
   
 Leon wouldn't even wait for the tomatoes to make it to the table. He'd mosey around the garden till he found the best tomato we had. He'd twist it off and eat it right there. That first bite sent juice flying everywhere!
   
 It didn't bother Leon. He'd pull a miniature round shaker--we'd call it "travel size" today--of Morton Salt out of his pocket and pour it liberally over where his next bite was going. He'd then move on to the second best tomato in the field….. It sometimes took Leon thirty minutes to gather three tomatoes for supper.
   
 Another great memory!
   
 Of course, you had to be careful making this memory. In between bites Leon would sometimes snatch a "puny" or "blemished" tomato off a vine and throw it at your head! I'm telling you, it was hard to hide behind a cucumber.
   
 I'd pull up a radish and throw it in his direction. He was five years older. I didn't have a chance and quickly retreated back past the woodpile.
   
 I can still hear his laughter……as he salted down a spot for his next bite.
   
 We are talking those Big Red Heirloom tomatoes here. Mom didn't like those smaller varieties. And she didn't like the plum colored or yellow tomatoes.
   
 And green tomatoes weren't even on her radar.
   
 Listen, we were poor in material things; there was no denying that. Money was scarce out towards our end of Stonewall Street. We did without some days. We "made do" with what we had. I have recounted a few of the hardships in this very column.
   
 But read my lips here, we were never one time so hard up that we had to resort to eating fried green tomatoes!
   
 And honestly, I don't remember even seeing those things when I was growing up. I practically lived with Bobby Brewer back in our grammar school days so I could watch him operate on birds in that little shed behind his garage. I ate more meals there some summers than at my own house. Miss Hazel never one time pushed any green tomatoes off on us.
   
 It was the same at our big family Fourth of July meals. There was always twenty-five or thirty of us. We ate in shifts. Granny had ever food group on that long table that you could imagine or had ever tasted. Green tomatoes were never to be found there.
   
 They were not, contrary to modern belief, some kind of southern delicacy; at least not in the South I grew up in. And I don't care how many books they write about the "good ole days" saying otherwise. Or how many movies Hollywood turns out praising the virtues of an overcooked, egg and flour soaked, greasy green tomato.
   
 Cathy and I stopped once at an authentic "throwback" Country Kitchen in fashionable Leiper's Fork, Tennessee. Naturally, fried green tomatoes were prominently displayed in the appetizer section.
   
 "Ma'am," I asked the exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable waitress, "Are these green tomatoes just regular red tomatoes that haven't ripened yet, or are they some particular variety of tomato that remain green through maturity?"
   
 Turns out she knew just about as much about tomatoes as those Hollywood experts.
   
 I'm telling you a flat-out gastronomical fact; it was a fried green tomato that invented cholesterol!
   
 Leon, as usual, got the last word on the matter. He said if they didn't serve it at the City Cafe, it wasn't worth eating. And the City Cafe's menu back in our day covered about everything you could think of from a fried baloney sandwich to a plate of pickled pig's feet…..but no green tomatoes, fried or otherwise.
   
 I rest my case.
   
 Respectfully,
   
 Kes

NEW YORK (AP) - Yoenis Céspedes came back with a bang, taking immediate advantage of the new designated hitter rule in the National League by launching a home run that sent Jacob deGrom and the New York Mets past the Atlanta Braves 1-0 in their season opener Friday. After five dominant innings from deGrom, who was firing 99 mph fastballs from the start, Céspedes connected in the seventh off reliever Chris Martin for his first homer since his previous major league game on July 20, 2018. The slugger missed most of the past two seasons with a string of leg injuries, requiring surgery on both heels and then a broken ankle.

When the NBA season resumes Thursday in a Florida quarantine bubble, fans will be able to appear virtually on giant videoboards around the court as part of digital technology enhancements.
 Heads and chests of more than 300 fans per game will appear on boards at the sides and ends of courts on 17-foot videoboards, five rows of people on each bringing a look of spectators when none will be courtside.
 Similar technology has been deployed by European soccer clubs, notably Manchester City, since play resumed.
 The coronavirus pandemic shut down the 2019-20 NBA season on March 11 when Utah’s Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19.
 Months of planning led to an isolation bubble restart plan at Walt Disney World in Orlando with 22 teams finishing the campaign and the NBA playoffs set to begin in August.
 The first experience of an NBA strategic alliance with Microsoft will be the tech firm’s “Together Mode,” part of broadcast enhancements that include previously unseen camera angles, some from camera’s operated robotically, and enhanced audio of more player shouts and shoe squeaks.
 Under the NBA’s virtual video experience, fans will be removed from their individual backgrounds and brought together in a shared visual space seen in the venue and on game broadcasts. Fans can remain safe from the virus at home while their cheers and energy can provide a measure of in-venue support for players.
 Music DJs and announcers will be used at venues to help replicate natural sounds from typical NBA games.
 Fans can also cheer for teams through NBA social media, virtual cheering to be reflected with animations and graphics to reflect the level of global fan engagement.
 “Working with our broadcast and technology partners, we are excited to unveil a series of enhancements that will bring fans closer to the game and allow them to personalize their viewing experience,” said Sara Zuckert, the NBA head of Next Gen telecast.
 “Our goal is to create an enjoyable and immersive experience where fans can engage with each other and maintain a sense of community as we restart the season under these unique and challenging circumstances.”

Barrett was a senior in 2019, but in her previous three seasons she played alongside fellow outside hitter Sydney Ferguson, who is now a rising sophomore at Penn State.
 “It was nice having someone else to help carry the load,” Barrett said.
 The Wolverines finished 20–3 in 2018. The final setback was a bit disheartening as they were overwhelmed by nerves and a deep and talented Princess Anne team. The Cavaliers were still smarting from a defeat to Tuscarora in the 2017 state semifinals and were determined not to have a repeat performance.
 “They were solid all-around,” Candelora said. “We hadn’t really seen somebody that was as strong defensively and then they just had that powerhouse on the outside.”
 That powerhouse was current University of Virginia rising sophomore Jayna Francis who went on to record 214 kills for the Cavaliers as a freshman in 2019.
 The final game notwithstanding the 2018 Wolverines were special to Candelora. In addition to Barrett and Ferguson earning first-team All-Area honors that season, setter Mainerys Munoz along with Aubrey Lynch and Gabriella Figueroa were second-team all-Commonwealth District selections.
 Ibby Allen and Annika Benson received honorable mention all-district recognition.
 “They were really fun to be around,” Candelora said. “A lot of times in girls’ sports you have team drama. But they really jelled well together.”

There are some of them that I will list below, as well as what they are used for, including shots, pills, powder, and tinctures. Shots. You can get your Green Indo Kratom in a shot for, like a five-hour energy shot style. The good part of this product is that it's easy to take, and not hard to knockback. The drawback to it is that it has a lot of milligrams in one bottle. Pills. Pills are a useful product that contains the Green Indo Kratom. They can come in a tablet form, as well as in capsules. These are good in a tight spot, they taste bad, but you can chase them with a drink. They have about 1.5 mg in each tablet and capsule, which makes it easy to keep your doses in check. Powder.

This product is used to take as a powder with water, to mix with tea, to cook in food, and about 100 other things. There is so much that you can do with the powder; it's a utility product.

Tinctures aren't available for all strains, but it is for this one. Is Green Indo Kratom Legal In The United States? It is legal for many of the states. There are 45 states in which it is legal to use, buy, and sell Kratom. However, in a few of these states, though, they are banned in cities or counties.

Cities and counties that have it banned are San Diego, CA, Jerseyville, IL, and Sarasota County, FL. Where Can You Find Green Indo Kratom Near You? You can always buy Kratom at stores online. There are many stores that have Kratom for sale all over the internet. If you are in need, and you are either not home or at a family member's house, then you may need to go somewhere to buy it. If that's the case, then you can type into a search engine, "Kratom stores near me." If that doesn't work, then you need to go by some local places that might sell it. You can go to the smoke shop or any cigarette store, and they may have it there. You may also be able to find it at a vape shop. Another place to check is a head shop where you can buy marijuana and CBD. The last location is basically anywhere that sells CBD. You can find some there. However, if none of these options are available, then just ask the people at those shops, they should be able to help you out.

Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump pivoted Friday to a longstanding campaign promise -- to lower drug prices.
 The President resurfaced a kitchen sink of controversial proposals aimed at reducing Americans' drug costs, which have advanced little during his term. He signed four executive orders, including ones on importing medications from Canada and basing the cost of drugs in the US on their prices in other countries -- both of which progressive Democrats, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, have pushed.
 The efforts, which largely reaffirm the policies of the administration, are unlikely to have an effect before the November election, if they ever do. Most require rule making by the Department of Health and Human Services and could be challenged in court.

Still, North Stafford used a rare mix of talent and togetherness to make history in the county and become the Fredericksburg area’s first state finalist since Chancellor fell to Loudoun Valley in the Group AA championship in 2002.
 That accomplishment propelled the 2018 Wolverines to Free Lance–Star team of the decade honors for 2010–19.
 “I think the Stone Bridge game in the state quarterfinals was a huge win for us that year,” Wolverines head coach Nicole Candelora said. “That was a real statement game for us.”
 Candelora said strong leadership and a desire to get past the state semifinals after falling to Tuscarora in that round in 2017 lifted the Wolverines to new heights.
 North Stafford reached the state title game again in 2019 before falling to Frank Cox 3–2. Candelora said although the 2018 team was swept by Princess Anne, it played as a unit throughout the season. It wasn’t as heavily reliant on start outside hitter Victoria Barrett.

TURNER, Lloyd (Butch) Earl, 72, of Chesterfield, VA, died July 21, 2020. Born and raised in Chesterfield, VA, he was the son of the late Linwood Robert and Della Moyer Turner. He proudly served in the U.S. Army, graduated with an Associates degree from John Tyler, worked almost 30 years at Media General and became a courier after that. For many years you could find him at the bowling alley or the ballfield. Those are things he did, but what he was, was the heart of our family. My mom's hubby, our dad and the best Papa. He was selfless and our protector. He loved us so big and so hard. He always made it right and good and better. He is survived by his wife Janice. They knew each other most of their lives and were married for almost 48 years. They drove each other crazy in the best way and loved each other fiercely. He would do anything for Mom. There was always so much laughter and so many late night talks, especially about ushis favorite daughter and favorite son. He is survived by his daughter (me), Kimberly Voxland and her husband Scott and the true apple of his eye, his granddaughter Logan or Piggles or LoLo. There are no words to describe what being a Papa meant to him. He adored Logan and she adores him and we have no doubt that she has the most fiercely protective guardian angel. When she hears thunder she knows that is Papa. Dad once asked me what things stick out when my brother and I think of him as a dad. I told him then, it's not really the individual things. It's what those things add up to...the best dad that two kids could have. But here are just a few. Tractor rides. In your lap or on the wagon. Following behind you in the garden as you tilled. The cold soil on my bare feet. Hundreds of phone calls that started- "Dad, I'm having a bad day." Baseball games and playing catch in the field. Word problems. Thunderstorms. Ghost stories at the beach. Riding on your shoulders. Giving me away- twice! Sitting in your lap watching football. Sunday meals after church. Steakums. Two please with cheese and Heinz 57. Friday night popcorn. Mornings before school when no one was allowed to speak to me but you. Canned sausage on Saturday mornings. Honeybuns and snickers from the store. Bringing you iced tea in a jar when you were bushhogging or plowing. Riding in the green Vega on the way to the beach. Burning trash. Playing Super Mario. Always waving goodbye and tooting the horn. The smell of tobacco in your shirt pocket and Merit Menthol 100s. Laughter and teasing. Lots of laughter and teasing. He is survived by his son, Jason Turner. His best friend. In Jason's words, "Love doesn't come close to describing what I feel for you. I am so proud of you and you succeeded in life in every way a man could. I hope that we can continue to spread love the way you always did and I hope that I can be just like you. You worked hard your whole life and kept us from hurt and protected us. Your work is through and you did so great. I'll never feel greater pride than I do calling you my dad. Rest easy Popyou earned it." Dad was preceded in death by his brother Garland Turner and by many of his aunts and uncles that he adored. He is survived by his brother Robert Turner and his sisters Mildred Paulette, Rose Turner and Grace Kidd and many, many nieces and nephews. A public viewing will be held on Sunday, July 26 from noon to 4 p.m. at J.T. Morriss and Sons at 3050 W. Hundred Road, Chester, Virginia 23831. Condolences may be registered at www.jtmorriss.com.

Canning the harvest should be a joyous and rewarding experience, but if you are in over your head it can be stressful and overwhelming, even dangerous.      Aspiring or novice canners should not wait for the so-called Harvest Season to get started. Midsummer is a great time to ease into the groove, work on your skills, and stock up on whatever gear and supplies you don't have, without the pressure of a mountain of produce. If you just do a jar or two here and there, you can keep skin in the game without breaking a sweat.      Where I live there are several families of Belarusian immigrants from a town called Olshany, which is known for its cucumbers. They are grown in shopping mall-sized greenhouses. They know about growing cucumbers, and have begun selling a small pickling variety that is sweet and juicy enough to eat on its own.      Some of the Belarusians sell pickles, too, and I bought some with high hopes, but they were disappointing. My friend Val, who was born in Olshany, explained that the pickles for sale at market aren't really like the pickles they eat at home, because food safety standards here require more salt, vinegar and heat than they care to subject their cucumbers to.      I had to ask Val what she does at home.      "I put the cucumbers in jars and I put all the spices. I always do horseradish, dill, parsley, garlic and all kinds of peppers. Put these jars in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes to sanitize them. While I do that, my brine is boiling. I pour the brine into each jar and seal it. Then I turn the jar over."      She inverts the pickles twice a day for the next two days, so they spend about half the time upside down. It's a way of compensating for the fact that she doesn't boil her pickles, a tactic that makes the pickles more crispy but more dangerous.      Boiling the pickles takes care of any microbes that the salt and vinegar somehow miss. Bacteria or spores can sometimes hide out in air pockets inside dill flowers or elsewhere. Inverting the jars like this ensures the brine makes it everywhere it needs to go.      Her brine recipe -- 24 cups water, 1 cup salt, 1 cup sugar and 4 cups white vinegar -- filled eight jars of cucumber pickles augmented with dill, garlic, crushed red pepper and horseradish leaves, as instructed. Val says the horseradish adds flavor and crispness to the pickles.      If you've been pickling your whole life like Val, you know the rules well enough to get away with breaking them. But new canners should take a more cautious approach and learn proper safety protocols. Ball Corporation has a book called "Ball Canning Back to Basics." Given that it produces virtually all of the canning jars in circulation today, it's worth reading what the company has to say about how to use its product.      The Ball book begins with a section on the basic gear, ingredients and procedures involved in canning. If you don't know the importance of adjusting acidity, accounting for altitude or measuring headspace, you should find a reputable source of information like this book or one of the many other educational resources in print and online.      The Ball recipe calls for "dill sprigs" but doesn't specify leaves or flowers. According to my sources, dill leaves alone won't cut it; there have to be flowers. It also calls for cutting of the cucumbers, which you don't have to do if you pick them small, Belarusian-style.      Ultimately, there is more than one correct way to can a pickle. And one cardinal rule by which every canner abides: If the seal is broken, don't eat it.      Ball-style Dills   • 4 pounds (3- to 5-inch) pickling cucumbers   • 1 gallon plus 1 quart water   • 10 tablespoons Ball Salt for Pickling and Preserving   • 3 cups white vinegar (5% acidity)   • 2 tablespoons sugar   • 1 tablespoon pickling spice   • 12 dill sprigs   • 2 tablespoons mustard seeds   • Ball Pickle Crisp Granules (optional)      Rinse the cucumbers under cold running water, and trim any that are longer than 5 inches so they'll fit comfortably in the jar. Cut each cucumber lengthwise into quarters. Place the spears in a large, clean container (such as a 12- to 18-quart food-safe plastic pail or basin). Combine 1 gallon of the water and 6 tablespoons of the salt in a large pitcher, stirring until the salt dissolves. Pour over the cucumbers; cover and let stand at room temperature 24 hours. Drain; rinse under cold running water; drain again.      Combine remaining 1 quart water, vinegar, sugar, pickling spice and remaining 1/4 cup salt in a stainless-steel or enameled saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring until the salt and sugar dissolve.      Place 2 of the dill sprigs and 1 teaspoon of the mustard seeds into a hot, freshly sterilized jar, and pack tightly with the cucumber spears. Ladle the hot pickling liquid over the spears, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Add 1/8 teaspoon Ball Pickle Crisp Granules to jar, if desired. Remove air bubbles. Wipe the jar rim. Center the lid on the jar. Apply the band, and adjust to fingertip-tight. Place the jar in a boiling water canner. Repeat until all the jars are filled.      Process the jars 10 minutes, adjusting for altitude. Turn off heat; remove the pot's lid, and let the jars stand 5 minutes. Remove the jars and cool.
