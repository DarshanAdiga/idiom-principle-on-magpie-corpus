SPRINGFIELD -- Illinois officials on Sunday announced the largest one-day jump in confirmed novel coronavirus cases and deaths in the state yet. But public and private labs' per-day testing ability is also higher than it has ever bee
 The Department of Public Health identified 1,105 new cases and 18 deaths, putting the state totals at 4,596 case in 47 counties and 65 related deaths.
 Gov. JB Pritzker said "we have weeks to go" before Illinois reaches a peak in new COVID-19 cases, expected "sometime in April." One of his priorities, he added, is to increase the state's testing ability.
 Five days ago, three state labs, four commercial facilities and 15 hospital labs processed 2,000 tests per day. The governor said that capacity is up to 4,000 daily with a goal of hitting 10,000 daily in the next 10 days.
 "That marker is significant because it's the number of tests per day that the scientists and experts tell us that we need to get a truly holistic understanding of the virus in each of our 102 counties," Pritzker said. "...This 10,000-a-day marker will give us the data to run a more mathematically significant model that offers us improved insight into how well our interventions are working."
 Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said additional testing will help health professionals "better understand" the extent of COVID-19's spread.
 Lab technicians so far have examined 28,000 tests statewide.
 "Ultimately, my goal is to reach a large enough testing capacity where we're able to test everyone who needs a test on a regular basis," Pritzker said. "... Every day we aren't hitting 10,000 tests or more is another day that we're not able to get answers that help us get past this current crisis."
 He called the federal government's lack of action in February a "profound failing" and "foundational mistake" that state officials had to correct. Although President Donald Trump's administration moved to upgrade its testing response, "we still have far to go," Pritzker said.
 And while Illinois awaits the additional tests federal officials promised -- which "may never be fulfilled," the governor said -- state leaders are taking other actions to address testing capacity
 "More testing available across the board will better inform the amount of virus we are seeing in the community, where we can take that information and identify specific concerted efforts to decrease the risk in those high-risk areas," Ezike said, "ultimately with the goal of limiting infection, limiting spread and ultimately limiting lives lost."
 Two executives from Abbott Laboratories, a medical devices company based in Illinois, "expressed their real dedication" to help the state acquire five- minute rapid COVID-19 tests, Pritzker said. And once other materials needed to process tests are acquired, a third shift of technicians will be added to all three of Illinois' laboratories.
 There are also five drive-thru facilities now -- three federal Health and Human Services ones; in Bolingbrook, Northlake and Joliet; and two operated by the Illinois National Guard, in McLean County and Harwood Heights.
 Testing priority dictates symptomatic first responders, health care workers, seniors and those with underlying conditions receive one first at those sites, which are permitted by federal guidelines to run only 250 tests per day.
 "Of course, we can't just test -- we have to treat," Pritzker said. "And in order to treat people, we have to increase hospital bed capacity."
 The governor said he will provide additional updates about how his administration is doing that, as well as its progress acquiring personal protective equipment such as gloves, gowns and masks, in the coming days.
 He did say, though, that Illinois is "acquiring millions of units" of equipment, most of it shared with facilities running through supplies quickly.
 The 18 newly reported deaths linked to the novel coronavirus were in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, LaSalle and St. Clair counties.
 Bond, Knox, Menard and Montgomery counties had their first confirmed COVID-19 cases.
 The IDPH updates its coronavirus website on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. It also maintains a hotline for citizens who have questions about the virus or want to report suspected cases: 1-800-889-3931.

SMITHSHIRE -- With no grocery store and no gas station, the only place to buy food in tiny Smithshire is Cindy Lou's Kitchen.
 The small diner between the post office and the grain elevator is also the town's central gathering place over coffee in the morning, bacon cheeseburgers for lunch, and catfish dinners on Friday nights.
 The pulse of the unincorporated Warren County town of 100 or so people has quieted with Cindy Lou's only open for takeout orders due to COVID-19.
 "It's pretty lonely once in a while," said owner Cindy Adkisson. "We miss the interaction with customers."
 Adkisson said takeout customers have stepped up to help her business, but it's still taken a big hit. They seem to feel the loneliness, too, lingering a bit to talk about grain prices or their families while picking up food before getting back to work.
 "Out here in the rural areas, people are still going about their daily business," Adkisson said. "They've got to go to town and get their feed and gas."
 Jeremy Simmons knows every Smithshire resident and is related to a good portion of them. He said small-town living feels kind of like a shield during the pandemic.
 "There's comfort, as far as dealing with this, in this little town," Simmons said. "We literally do know everyone here, and everyone looks out for each other. The majority of residents are elderly and we're being very careful."
 That includes picking up mail and delivering freezer meals to the elderly so they don't have to go out. Though residents have to drive to another town for a gallon of milk, they'll see if anyone needs anything before they go.
 As a teacher, Simmons said internet access is a concern. In Smithshire, his service is fine, but out in the country, some lack access or strong connections.
 Superintendent Paula Markey of West Central District 235, a rural consolidated school district covering almost 300 square miles in three counties, estimates 10% of the district's 750 students lack internet access at home.
 The district provides computers for all students to use at home and is adapting lessons for those without internet. In addition, Markey said 55% of families in the district are low-income.
 "We're very concerned for those families and we want to make sure we are providing for their needs," Markey said.
 The district is delivering meals to all towns in the district and having students check in daily with teachers.
 "Being in a rural community, we don't have all the services that others do," Markey said. "We know that this is tough on our families."
 Outside Kirkwood, farmer Justin Allaman is busy prepping for spring tillage and planting while the other parts of his family's life, from church services to farm bureau meetings, grind to a halt. He's worried about oil prices affecting the ethanol market, but he feels safer in the country.
 "You look at the bigger cities and that's where we they are having a lot of outbreaks," Allaman said. "Out here, we are a little more secluded. We can go outside anytime we want to. We can take a walk in the timber."
 The store at Belted Cow Orchard between Kirkwood and Oquawka is closed for now, but the drive-thru is open for homemade doughnuts and coffee. Owner Marci Meyer said those sales, though down, are "keeping the lights on."
 Meyer said the rural community is keeping connected online and doing their best to support local businesses and each other through small kindnesses, such as paying for other people's orders in the drive-thru.
 "People are so joyful to be out and doing something," Meyer said. "There's anxiety out there for sure. But any little piece of joy that people can grab at, they are gravitating toward."
 Rural Monmouth farmer Andy Jenks is staying close to his home, farm office and shop these days, while looking ahead to practicing social distancing in his tractor cab this spring.
 Though farm life allows some distance from society, it also means that medical care is farther away. Jenks said he worries about his family and their health as well as his employees and their families. He also worries about local businesses, but he believes in the strength of rural communities.
 "What I am confident in is the resolve of these individuals and their ability to rally around each other in these tough times," Jenks said.
 Jenks said rural communities are known for coming together to help farmers in times of illness or hardship.
 If it should come to that locally, Jenks has no doubt people will step up.
 "It's just the way we are. We look out for each other," Jenks said.

AMSTERDAM -- The Ahoy concert hall in Rotterdam should have hosted the glitter and glamour of the Eurovision song contest in May, but instead is now being turned into an emergency hospital to help the Netherlands battle its coronavirus outbreak.
 On Monday, work began on installing the first 88 of a possible 680 hospital beds in the halls of Ahoy, normally used for big concerts, trade fairs and international sports events.
 Instead of its usual crowd of pop music and sports fans, Ahoy will open its doors from mid-April to people suffering from the coronavirus or other illnesses who need care but do not have to be admitted to a hospital.
 This should help alleviate the pressure on hospitals in the Netherlands, where the number of coronavirus infections has risen rapidly since the first case was reported on Feb. 27.
 As of Sunday, almost 11,000 coronavirus infections had been confirmed in the country, with 771 deaths.
 The Dutch National Institute for Public Health said on Sunday that intensive care units in Dutch hospitals could reach peak capacity in the coming two weeks at the current rate of infections.
 To keep hospitals from overflowing, emergency wards for coronavirus and other patients are also being installed in hotels across the country of 17 million people.
 Only last month, Ahoy drew more than 100,000 spectators to the ABN Amro World Tennis Tournament and in recent months has hosted concerts by international stars such as Pink and 50 Cents.
 However, Ahoy saw its most anticipated event of the year scrapped two weeks ago, when the coronavirus pandemic forced the Eurovision song contest organizers to cancel an event that would have drawn tens of thousands of spectators in mid-May. (Reporting by Bart Meijer Editing by Gareth Jones)

LONDON -- Britain on Monday named Ken McCallum, a career spy who led the response to the attempted murder of Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal, as the new head of its MI5 domestic intelligence agency.
 McCallum, who has worked in MI5 for 25 years, rose through the ranks working across the agency's main fronts from Northern Ireland to countering Islamist militants and ensuring the safety of the 2012 London Olympics.
 Then, after former Russian double agent Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found poisoned with a Soviet-developed nerve agent known as "Novichok" in 2018, McCallum led the agency's response to the attempted murder, MI5 said.
 "Our people - with our partners - strive to keep the country safe, and they always want to go the extra mile," McCallum said in a statement.
 "Having devoted my working life to that team effort, it is a huge privilege now to be asked to lead it," he added.
 Britain blamed Russia for the attack in which a British citizen died. Russia denied any role, though Western powers expelled dozens of Russian spies working under diplomatic cover.
 Skripal, a former officer in Russian military intelligence (GRU), betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence.
 Andrew Parker, who retires at the end of April, has led MI5 since 2013. He stayed on longer than is usual to ensure a stable transition during Britain's exit from the European Union which took place on Jan. 31.
 SPIES IN SPOTLIGHT
 During Parker's watch, MI5 had to contend with a spate of deadly militant attacks in the United Kingdom including the 2017 Manchester suicide bombing which killed 22 people, and attacks on Westminster and London Bridge the same year.
 The Manchester suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was known to the authorities but not under active investigation when he blew himself up in the foyer of the Manchester Arena after an Ariana Grande concert. A later inquiry said both MI5 and counter-terrorism police had missed chances to prevent the attack.
 MI5, established in 1909 to counter German espionage ahead of World War One, is tasked with protecting British national security. Its main job is currently countering international terrorism though it is also a counter-intelligence agency.
 It employs about 4,000 people.
 MI5 said one of McCallum's top priorities was enabling the agency to seize the fast-moving opportunities provided by technology, including machine learning.
 "Ken McCallum's expertise and leadership will be crucial to ensuring that the Security Service remains agile and creative in the face of new and emerging threats to our security," said Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary.
 He helped deepen MI5's partnerships with the MI6 foreign spy service and the GCHQ eavesdropping agency and has worked on secondment with the business ministry on digital issues as well as a non-executive director of the Nuclear Decomissioning Authority.
 In 2017, he was appointed deputy director general of MI5 with responsibility for all of MI5's operational and investigative work.
 McCallum grew up in Glasgow and has a degree in Mathematics from Glasgow University. He enjoys mountain hiking. (Editing by Michael Holden and Stephen Addison)
