 Earl Locklear Harrisonburg - Earl Locklear, of Sunnyside Retirement Community, passed away peacefully on the morning of March 21, 2020 at the age of 91. He was a proud member of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. He is survived by his loving wife of 62 years, Janet Locklear, also of Sunnyside. Earl was born in Robeson County, NC on January 25, 1929, the youngest of seven children to Julius Locklear and Annie Sampson Locklear. Growing up during the Great Depression, his early years were spent on the family farm, living off the land, learning to cultivate and harvest cash crops like cotton and tobacco and developing an appreciation for the value of education. Upon graduation from Pembroke High School, Earl enlisted in the United States Air Force , where he trained in policing and security, and was assigned to the Military Police. He proudly served in a number of stateside locations but was most fond of his time serving as a Staff Sergeant on the security forces in the Marshall Islands during post WWII nuclear testing. Following his time in the military, Earl moved to Richmond, Virginia where he worked for Dupont and the local YMCA while attending college classes at the Richmond Professional Institute (now VCU). He graduated from RPI with a degree in Business and Education and accepted a position teaching Distributive Education at Robert E Lee High School in Staunton, Va. It was there that Earl met and married Janet, where they would raise their family and where he would work his entire career. Earl went on to earn a Master's degree in Education from the University of Virginia and moved from teaching to public school administration. Over his career, he would serve many years as an elementary school principal and finished his career in the school board office supervising services for the community's special needs students. Earl and Janet retired to Wilmington, NC in 1998 to be close to their grandchildren and to enjoy the coastal lifestyle. Earl will be remembered as a gregarious member of the community, a faithful servant of the Lord and a friend to all. He and Janet were dedicated members of Covenant Presbyterian Church in Staunton and Little Chapel on the Boardwalk in Wrightsville Beach. He loved music, especially singing in the church choir and his tastes ranged from Beethoven to Elvis. He was fondly known by his close friends as Lock and Earl the Pearl. Earl was a fitness advocate years ahead of his time and loved volleyball, handball and golf. He was an avid fisherman his entire life and has many trophies to his credit. In addition to Janet, Earl is survived by his older brother Ralph Locklear and wife Sue of Fresno, Ca., sons Kent and wife Cindy of Wilmington, NC and Mark of Pinehurst, NC, and daughter Valerie and husband Doug Rohr of Verona, Va. Also surviving are his grandchildren, of which he was most proud, Rachel, Jacob and Caroline Locklear of Wilmington and Jackson and Avery Locklear of Pinehurst. Earl leaves behind many nieces and nephews who also brought him great joy. The family is so very appreciative of all the staff at Sunnyside, most especially the dedicated and caring staff of Health Care 2nd Floor, who have loved on our Earl over these recent months. In light of the current situation there will be no services however the family plans to honor Earl's request of a memorial mixer at a later date. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to one of Earl's favorite organizations; the National Museum of the American Indian, the or your local chapter of The First Tee. Henry Funeral Home is handling the arrangements. Condolences may be sent to the family at www.henryfuneralhome.net .

While Liverpool’s trajectory continues along an upward curve, Coutinho’s magic deserted him in Barcelona.


  He only scored 21 goals in 76 appearances for Barcelona before losing his place in Ernesto Valverde’s starting XI. Barca have since shipped him out to Bayern Munich on loan, where he’s by no means a guaranteed starter under Hans- Dieter Flick.


  Bayern have the option to buy Coutinho for £109million this summer but it’s looking increasingly unlikely that they’ll take Barcelona up on that offer.


  Coutinho has been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea, while there could be a route back in at Barcelona with Valverde out of the picture and Quique Setién now at the helm, though his future is far from certain.

According to IEA (International Energy Agency), the worldwide energy demand grew by 4% (900TWh) in 2018. In the same year, the estimation of total electricity production across the globe was attained through coal and natural gas, with coal contributing to 25.6% and natural gas with 27.9% of the total production. Additionally, there is a rising demand for clean, sustainable and eco-friendly energy generation due to increased concerns pertaining to rise in CO2 emissions from energy generation.

HURLBURT FIELD -- The Hurlburt Field airman who died in a Thursday training accident at a Navy facility in Panama City has been identified as Airman 1st Class Keigan Baker, 24, an Air Force Special Tactics combat controller apprentice assigned to the Special Tactics Training Squadron of the Hurlburt Field-based 24th Special Operations Wing.
   
 Baker was found unresponsive after he went missing during a surface training swim at Naval Support Activity Panama City. The incident remains under investigation.
   
 At the time of his death, Baker was taking part in the Air Force Combat Dive Course run by Air Education and Training Command's Special Warfare Training Wing headquartered at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland.
   
 "This is devastating loss to the entire Special Tactics community," U.S. Air Force Col. Matthew Allen, commander of the 24th SOW, said in a news release. "We are very grateful for Keigan's willingness to serve our nation and vow to honor his memory."
   
 Baker enlisted in the United States Air Force in June 2018, and entered the two-year combat control training program after basic military training. At the time of his death, he was a student in the Air Force Combat Dive Course at Naval Support Activity Panama City.
   
 As a Special Tactics combat controller apprentice, Baker was training to deploy into combat zones to conduct reconnaissance, global access, precision strike and personnel recovery operations.
   
 U.S. Air Force Col. Parks Hughes, commander of the service's Special Warfare Training Wing, said in a statement that "Keigan's loss is felt across the entire training wing ... . Our thoughts and prayers are with Keigan's family, friends and teammates."
   
 Baker, a graduate of Longview's Mark Morris High School, also held a bachelor's degree in business administration from Eastern Washington University.
   
 A number of agencies were involved in search and recovery efforts in the incident, including the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center, U.S. Coast Guard Station Panama City, other military dive units, the Bay County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
   
 Rep. Matt Gaetz issued a statement in response to Baker's death, saying the airman's "patriotism and his devotion to serving his country will not soon be forgotten. Our Northwest Florida community and the entire nation mourns the loss of Airman First Class Keigan Baker and joins together in prayer for his family during this difficult time."
   
 Funeral arrangements for Baker are pending and will be announced.

BAXLEY, Ga. (WTOC) - The coronavirus is impacting all of our daily lives, including those responsible for making sure we have food in the agriculture industry.“Our family is 100 percent agriculture,” said farmer Reid Turner.Turner has farmed the land of Baxley, Georgia since 1998, working with his father on nearly 2,800 acres of land.The Turner's farm nearly 2,800 acres in Baxley, Georgia.“On our farm, we grow tobacco, cotton, peanuts, and pecans. My wife, she works with her family. They have a blueberry operation. They harvest and pack their own berries,“ said Turner.But some of those crops could be at risk of living up to their full potential due to the coronavirus.The coronavirus could limit the number of vital farm workers that could get in the country“It’s already having an effect on our farm and a lot of farms around us. We use the guest worker program. We bring workers in, seasonal employees in from other countries, especially Mexico, to help fill positions that local people don’t necessarily want to do anymore,” said Reid Turner.Not having a full staff could hurt farms not just across the Coastal Empire, but across the entire country.“We are already dealing with the issue this week a lot of the consulates have closed in other countries. The time frame to get the guys here is getting very narrow. If we don’t get employees here on time, crops won’t get planted, crops won’t get harvested. It will have a large impact in this whole area and agriculture in general,” said Reid Turner.Despite the upcoming challenges, Reid wants the community to know that the Turner family is there for them.“We don’t look to benefit from a pandemic, a bad situation for everyone else. Of course, we will do what needs to be done to keep the farm going,” said Turner.The Turner family works hard every dayKeeping the farm going is important to Reid. He has two kids and hopes they will follow in his footsteps if they choose to do so.Reid would be happy if his children became fifth-generation farmers, if that's what they want to do!“My hopes for the farm, of course, stay in business as long as I can. Try to produce more with less inputs, less fertilizer, less chemicals. Make it better for generations ahead of us,” said Turner.Copyright 2020 WTOC. All rights reserved.

Last year, Shane Meadows Channel 4 series “The Virtues” swept Series Mania’s main international competition on the back of critical and audience acclaim. This year, the boldest title in the selfsame section may come again from Channel 4: Lucy Kirkwood’s “Adult Material,” which lifts the lid on the adult entertainment industry, through the travails and undoing of a caring mother and veteran porn star. Never explicit nor ogling, but still sure to shock some in its more outré sex exposition, “Adult Material” still tackles highly serious themes - female pleasure, and the red lines in sexual consent, with one Harvey Weinstein moment which underscores the toxic mix of entertainment industry power and assumed sexual prerogative. “Channel 4 does things which other broadcasters just don’t dare to do,” says Hefszberg. Little wonder that Channel 4’s chief executive Alex Mahon is the 2020 recipient of Variety's International Achievement in Television Award.

MALCOLM BRIGHT (Tom Payne, "The Walking Dead") has a gift. He knows how killers think and how their minds work. Why? Back in the 1990s, his father was one of the worst, a notorious serial killer called "The Surgeon." So it makes sense Bright is the best criminal psychologist around; murder is THE FAMILY business. He will use his twisted genius to help the NYPD solve crimes and stop killers, all while dealing with a manipulative mother, annoyingly normal sister, a homicidal father still looking to bond with his prodigal son, and his own constantly evolving neuroses.

“There are players who are going to go down lame from the illness, who might not have recovered or who will catch it from someone.


  “Then it spreads to other players, so it won't be fair, it's not a level playing field, I just don't feel it's right.


  “And there's going to have to be people in that stadium to man the stadium – security, etcetera, as well in there, which puts everyone at risk.


  “At this time, all this 'we're gonna win this or so and so might not go down or so and so might not get promoted', you've got to put those type of things to one side.


  “This is about life and death situations, about society and the wider grand scheme of things. So, football, it ain't that serious in that sense.


  “Listen, we all love it. I love football, we all love it. But it ain't life or death.


  “When it comes to matters like these, you've got to put people's health before anything and I just think that's the way it should be.


  “Start the season with a clean slate. Once this health situation is all ironed out, all sorted out, then we can start a new season, because I just don't see it happening in that time.


  “Now if we wake up in the next month and it's all gone and the country can get back to normal immediately, then I think a conversation can then happen about that.


  “But I don't see that happening, not from what we're being told.”


  PFA deputy chief executive Bobby Barnes revealed on Monday afternoon that most of its members now accept that there is “no alternative” but to play games behind closed doors in order to finish the season, but Ferdinand is against the idea and believes it would be a health risk to players.


  “PSG v Dortmund the other day, behind closed doors, but outside there were thousands of fans,” he added.

“I thought I accomplished what I wanted to at the combine. I talked it over with my agent and my trainer, and didn’t think I needed to redo anything like that (at Pro Day),” Wilson said. “I wanted to excel in the position drills, mainly.


  “They put us through some different position drills than we did at the combine. I wanted to show that I was still able to do those.”


  Wilson's draft stock is trending upward, with Sports Illustrated projecting him to go to the New England Patriots in the third round. Scott Wright, a well-known NFL draft analyst who runs NFLDraftCountdown.com, shared his thoughts with WyoSports on the former Cowboy.


  Wright said he projects Wilson as a second-or third-round selection.


  “When talking about prospects who’ve seen their NFL draft stock rise the most in the last six months, Wyoming linebacker Logan Wilson would be near the top of the list,” Wright told WyoSports. “There is plenty to like about Wilson, starting with a four-year track record of high-level production. An active, aggressive ‘backer, Wilson shows terrific instincts and is a reliable tackler with a motor that is always running.”


  Wilson’s versatility works in his favor.


  “As a former defensive back, Wilson has the ability to match up and drop into coverage, which is so important in this pass-happy day and age,” Wright said. “As an added bonus, Wilson is capable of playing inside or outside linebacker and can offer value by contributing on special teams. After entering his senior season with a late round grade, it now looks like Wilson could be a Day 2 pick.


  “To put that into perspective, less than five inside linebackers are selected in the Top 100 overall, so securing one of those coveted slots is quite an accomplishment.”


  The status of the NFL draft itself is up in the air due to COVID-19. With the recent declaration that gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited indefinitely, the fanfare that generally accompanies the event is unlikely to be allowed by the time the draft rolls around in Las Vegas from April 23-25.


  After Pro Day, Wilson said he was planning on going to Las Vegas for the event, though not to the actual draft itself. Given the current state of things, those plans could be on hold, too. Regardless of where he ends up watching the most important three days of his life, Wilson feels he’s made his case to the NFL as a prospect.


  Does he think he’s done all he can to raise his stock over the last few months?


  “Yeah,” Wilson said confidently. “Yeah, I do.”
