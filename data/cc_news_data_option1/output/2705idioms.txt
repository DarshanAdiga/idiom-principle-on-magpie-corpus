ANSA) - BOLOGNA, 10 LUG - Grazie a un'indagine sui social, i carabinieri sono riusciti ad identificare e denunciare per lesioni personali gravi in concorso dieci ragazzi che il 27 giugno avrebbero picchiato un 17enne ad Imola, vicino all'Autodromo. Durante il pestaggio, il minore riportò la frattura del naso e un trauma cranico facciale: medicato al pronto soccorso dell'ospedale di Imola, venne dimesso con 21 giorni di prognosi. Secondo quanto ricostruito, il 17enne era stato aggredito con testate, calci e pugni da un gruppo di coetanei, a lui sconosciuti, dopo che si era rifiutato di dare una sigaretta ad uno di loro. Quest'ultimo, sentendosi mancare di rispetto, gli aveva spaccato il setto nasale. Caduto a terra per il dolore, il 17enne era stato picchiato anche dagli altri. Poi gli aggressori sono fuggiti. Oltre al ragazzo che ha rotto il naso al minorenne, è risultato che un altro giovane ha minacciato e tenuto alla larga gli amici del 17enne per impedirgli di aiutarlo.
