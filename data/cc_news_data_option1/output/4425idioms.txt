What happened in the swing States in 2016? What is the situation today?
 Mr. Trump’s surprisingly strong performance in the swing States delivered him the presidency despite losing the overall popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016. Victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — States that were relatively Democratic-leaning — besides other swing States such as Florida and Ohio, settled the election for Mr. Trump as white voters without a college education in suburban and rural areas, including white working class voters, chose Mr. Trump over Ms. Clinton. Opinion polls in these States, also turned out to be wrong, over-estimating support for Ms. Clinton. This was because the percentage of voters who recorded themselves as “undecided” was substantial, getting into two digits for some swing States. Many of them seemingly voted for Mr. Trump finally, rendering the opinion polls wrong.
 Comment | What pushed Trump to his triumph
 In 2020, however, the number of undecided voters in the swing States have been substantially lower in most opinion polls, pointing to more clear support for either candidate. Mr. Biden, for now, seems to have an edge over Mr. Trump in the swing States and beyond. However, if polling errors from 2016 were to be accounted for, the election is rendered much closer. In such a scenario, Mr. Biden would have to win a larger swing State, such as Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes), and a combination of other smaller ones to ensure a victory. Even so, the fact that there are pathways to a Trump victory suggests that the election cannot be called till all the votes are counted.

Barack Obama accused Donald Trump of failing to take the coronavirus pandemic and the presidency seriously as he campaigned alongside Joe Boden in Michigan on the final weekend of the 2020 campaign.
 Mr Obama, the 44th president, and Mr Biden, his vice president who wants to be the 46th, held drive-in rallies in Flint and Detroit.
 The memories of Mr Trump’s win in Michigan and the rest of the Upper Midwest are still searing in the minds of many Democrats during this closing stretch before Tuesday’s election.
 That leaves Mr Biden in the position of holding a consistent lead in the national polls and an advantage in most battlegrounds, including Michigan, yet still facing anxiety it could all slip away.
 As of Saturday morning, nearly 90 million voters had already cast ballots nationwide, according to a tally by The Associated Press.
 Tens of millions more will vote by the time polls close on Tuesday night.

On a day uncertainty reigned in England as the nation prepared to go back into lockdown, the Premier League returned to something resembling normality.
 Three of the teams expected to contend for the title — Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool — all picked up wins in back-to-back fixtures on Saturday. There was also the familiar sight of Liverpool, the defending champion, back atop the standings thanks to a late goal that is becoming its trademark.
 Diogo Jota came off the bench and scored in the 85th minute to earn Liverpool a hard-fought 2-1 victory over West Ham, extending the team’s unbeaten record in league play at Anfield to 63 games — tied for the longest streak in the club's history.

Hammons says there were able to&nbsp;move the paper ballot scanner outside to make room for the additional voting machines inside.“Knowing that it’s Saturday and people will be off work they should have had more voting machines in there,” voter Tequila Gardner said.Many people left the line, deciding not to wait calling it voter suppression.Election officials say they too did not expect lines to be as long as they were. They say they don’t want anyone to feel that their vote is being suppressed and say limited space is to blame.Election officials say their new headquarters will be ready next year and will allow for more space and voting machines.That last day people can vote in-person absentee ahead of election day is on Monday.“We didn’t want to chance it and wait on Election Day,” voter Ashley Waters said.&nbsp; I wanted to give myself the opportunity if anything goes wrong today I would have another chance."Reporter Lillian Donahue went to another polling location at the West Ashley Seacoast in Charleston.She said the wait to cast a ballot there was about one hour, causing the line to wrap around the back of the building.Voting line or Disney World?!

(AP) - Ghosts, skeletons, princesses and black cats roamed the streets as usual this Halloween, but they kept their distance, wore face coverings and carried hand sanitizer in their quest for treats.Like with everything else this year, the pandemic also left its mark on Halloween. Parades, parties and haunted houses were canceled due to bans on large gatherings and concerns that spooky celebrations could spread the coronavirus.But across the U.S., parents and costumed kids found ways to preserve the essence of the holiday Saturday while also observing the rules of social distancing.In the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Tomeka Ray took her 4-year-old daughter, Diamond, trick-or-treating in the afternoon. The girl, dressed as a princess, wore her mask and carried sanitizer, with more of the disinfecting gel in the car for good measure, Ray said, so “I wasn’t too worried.”At one home neighbors had rigged a remote treat-delivery system fashioned out of a ventilation tube, with a cardboard cutout at the end colored to make it look like a dragon’s mouth.“I like that. I really do. That’s the third house I’ve seen that has that,” Ray said.Caden Korchuk, 11, and friend Jayden Schoning, 10, both dressed as skeletons, also appreciated getting their candy delivered from a distance.“Everything out here is really cool because of all the chutes,” Korchuk said.In Glen Allen, Virginia, just outside Richmond, neighbors left individually wrapped bags of candy on tables at the end of driveways to avoid having dozens of kids coming to their doors and sticking their hands in the same big, germy candy bowls.Matt Cheadle, a 35-year-old furniture designer, called it “extremely” socially distanced trick-or-treating.Parker, his 5-year-old son, was going as Yoshi, the green dinosaur from the Mario Kart video game series, and the chance to show off his costume and get candy is all he’s talked about recently“He’s already had so much taken away from him this year,” Cheadle said. “We think this is a small compromise for Halloween. The little kiddos will still dress up, they’ll still get to go driveway to driveway, but not door to door.”Halloween comes as coronavirus cases are surging in many parts of the country and health officials warn of the potential for even higher numbers this winter.More than 230,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the country, and total U.S. cases surpassed 9 million on Friday. Over the past two weeks, more than 78,700 new virus cases have been reported each day on average, up from about 55,100 in mid-October, according to Johns Hopkins University.So many cities and towns issued guidelines for celebrating Halloween safely.New York City’s health department recommended avoiding large groups, haunted houses and bobbing for apples — “Keep your spit to yourself,” it said in an advisory. Officials urged people instead to focus on safe activities like pumpkin carving, home decorating, outdoor scavenger hunts and virtual costume parties.Lots of festivities were canceled, including the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, a nearly 50-year tradition that typically draws tens of thousands to the streets of Manhattan. Organizers staged a virtual puppet parade instead.In New Hampshire, where coronavirus cases are also on the rise, emergency management officials in Coos County recommended residents not participate in door-to-door trick-or-treating or group events. Trick-or-treating was called off entirely in Pittsburg, a town of about 900 in the northern part of the state.Betsy Curtin and her sons were also skipping it for safety’s sake. Instead, it was a visit to their grandparents' houses in costume — 7-year-old Alex as Batman and 9-year-old Charlie as Captain America — then back home for pizza and a movie.“I only bought Kit Kats for them, so I’ve officially ruined their weekend,” Curtin said. “Hoping the grandparents come through with specialty chocolates.”___AP writers Don Babwin, in River Forest, Illinois, and Michael Sisak, in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.

The new-look defence got off to a rocky start when Pablo Fornals opened the scoring just 10 minutes in but Liverpool rallied to take a 2-1 victory, with goals from Mohamed Salah and substitute Diego Jota sealing three points.
 Phillips spent last season on loan in the 2. Bundesliga with Stuttgart honing his talents, and Klopp was happy to see the youngster step up when his side needed him.
 "He's a brilliant guy, smart guy, intelligent, everything. He's not easy on the eye, he's not Messi but who cares?" the manager joked to _Match of the Day_.
 "In the air, he's a monster! He was incredible.
 "For the first game, I think everyone can imagine how nervy that must be after a long wait. It's a crazy story, three years ago he was on his way to America to college.
 "Twelve Championship teams wanted him and to me it was clear he was going, and I was fine with that - and it didn't work out for whatever reason, and it's great! Tonight he was spot on, helped the team incredibly."
 Klopp was also pleased to see Jota make an impact off the bench, scoring what proved to be the winner five minutes from the end.

The costs of raw materials have a significant impact on the level of expenses. If the prices of raw materials and related factors such as energy prices increase, and if new companies cannot pass those price increases on to customers, their results of operations and financial condition would suffer.
