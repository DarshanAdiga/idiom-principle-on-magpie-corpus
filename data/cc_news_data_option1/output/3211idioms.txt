The packaging industry is the fastest growing segment and is expected to grow significantly during the forecast period. Thermoplastics are used in the packaging of different beverages, foods, model kits, sports and leisure boxes, etc. Thermoplastics applications are poised for growth in the United States, owing to the increasing use of these plastics to replace traditional plastics, such as polypropylene and polyethylene, especially in the food packaging industry as they are energy efficient and lighter than alternative materials. Due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency, thermoplastics are popularly used in applications where heat sealing is necessary, thereby, driving the growth of the market.

Broadway? He could take it or leave it. He liked staying at home – for many years, a cottage in Niagara-on-the Lake, Ontario – and he liked living in Canada. Five years later, in 1998, Prince insisted that he be cast in the Lincoln Center production of Jason Robert Brown’s Parade, another great fable of social and political injustice, this time based on the true life story of a Jewish factory manager, Leo Frank, wrongly convicted in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1913, of a young girl’s murder on the grounds that he was the last person to see her alive.

There is no way to enforce a mask mandate unless you put the nation under martial law and arrest maskless people.

The Manheim Township school board during a three-hour meeting Thursday night altered its reopening plan by approving a blended instructional model for grades seven through 12 for the first three weeks.
 Students would also be dismissed two hours early every day for the first week of school, which starts Aug. 25, under the new plan.
 The pivot comes on the heels of new guidance from the state departments of education and health that recommended schools in counties with “moderate” COVID-19 transmission rates reopen fully remote or under a blended model, which combines in-person and remote learning.

NBA coaches are hired -- and fired -- every offseason. It's part of basketball, and this year will be no different, no matter how many changes the league endured this season. Teams are constantly looking to get better, and switching up the person calling shots from the sideline is typically one of the first moves made by an organization in the name of improvement.
 The standard for coaching in the NBA has arguably never been higher. This new world of overwhelming expectation creates plenty of action on the coaching carousel, and there are several coaches likely on the hot seat.
 On Friday, the Bulls fired Jim Boylen after an abysmal 39-84 record as coach over a year-plus at the helm. Last month, the Knicks hired Tom Thibodeau as their next head coach after an extensive search directed by new team president Leon Rose. Thibodeau will be looked at to help the franchise climb back to consistent contention in the Eastern Conference. New York's other team could be next in line to make a move as the Nets are set to begin their head- coaching search after their season comes to a close. Early candidates for the gig include Los Angeles Lakers assistant Jason Kidd, Philadelphia 76ers assistant Ime Udoka, Los Angeles Clippers assistant Ty Lue and former Rockets and Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy.

There are only three mechanisms to improve an NFL roster: via trade, via the draft or through free agency.

Once in a blue moon the team would dip their toes into free agency, but nearly never dabbled in the mercenary business.
