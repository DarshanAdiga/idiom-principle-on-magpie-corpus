That said, Rickhoff's criticism of the how deputies handled the tragic case of Damian Lamar Daniels is spot on. In the span of 24 hours last month, deputies responded to four mental health calls for Daniels, but the last call proved fatal, with a deputing shooting Daniels twice. He had done nothing wrong. He had broken no laws. But he was experiencing suicidal thoughts, hearing things and feeling paranoid. Why deputies didn't connect Daniels with a mental health worker, or at least colleagues with mental health training, is a mystery. And yet, Salazar has said, incredulously, that deputies did nothing wrong.

In reliable form, Seattle Times readers have once again ponied up cash to buy school supplies for children who are our region's most in need.          But what happens when the economy is plagued with double-digit unemployment and the school year is challenged by pandemic uncertainty? Readers reach even deeper and give even more to The Times editorial board school-supply drive — blowing by the past record.           Since July, 923 readers donated a total of $150,841.33. Dozens more people contributed to a total that exceeds last year's mark by about $28,000.          Readers' generous support, which may be tax deductible, means thousands of students in King and Snohomish counties are starting school well equipped for learning. Among them are students like Joseph, Daniel and Romel, who are entering fourth, third and first grade, respectively, in Seattle Public Schools.

Men who choked women were the biggest single group of chokers, CHOKED, followed by men choking men, women choking women, and trans and gender nonbinary individuals choking and being choked. Straight cisgender men, perhaps unsurprisingly, were the least likely to report that partners choked them during sex. Trans and gender nonbinary participants in Dr. Herbenick’s research more often reported that their partners established consent prior to choking, but across the board there was still a great deal of nonconsensual choking going on.

"Our office provided substantial assistance leading to today's indictment, and our continuing investigation — which examines potential failures by Dr. Hadden's employer and hospital to disclose additional incidents of abuse to our office and to regulators when required — is intensely active and ongoing," Vance's spokesman Danny Frost wrote in an email.
 Anthony T. DiPietro, an attorney who represents more than 100 women accusing Hadden of assault, said he was thankful for the renewed effort to prosecute Hadden after the case languished for years.
 "In some ways, this has been a long time coming but in others maybe things are just getting started," DiPietro said in an interview. "We're just grateful that prosecutors at the SDNY are taking a close look at this."
 On behalf of the victims, DiPietro is also suing Columbia University, accusing the administration of knowingly allowing the abuses to continue unfettered for decades.
 "To me what happened was Hadden was allowed to negotiate something closely resembled an early retirement than a criminal sentence for a sexual felony," DiPietro said of Hadden's earlier plea deal.
 In an emotional interview with CNN Evelyn Yang called the punishment a "slap on the wrist." Yang said she was seven months pregnant when Hadden assaulted her at the end of a routine appointment.

 Hoechstetter echoed Yang's frustrations with the plea deal, saying that the federal case offers the victims a second chance at justice.

Mesut Ozil has revealed that he is fit and ready to play in Arsenal’s opening game of the season if Mikel Arteta picks him.


  The German was frozen out of the Arsenal first team during the restart and he missed the final 13 games of the season.


  He had been a key part of Mikel Arteta’s team when the Spaniard first became Arsenal’s manager, however, when he didn’t perform as well as the gaffer wanted, he axed him from his plans.


  Ozil returned to action for the Gunners in their recent preseason game. The match was played behind closed doors and the German will hope that he has impressed Arteta enough to earn a place in the team when the Premier League returns.


  He recently conducted a Q&A session of Twitter and fans asked him several questions.


  One of the questions he was asked was if he was fit to play against Fulham and he responded:


  “I’m fit & ready and doing my best. Unfortunately, it’s not in my hands to decide about the squad on the weekend. We will see! #AskMesut?”


  Arteta has revealed that every player has been given a fresh opportunity to play for the club in the new season.


  Ozil will hope to impress again when given the chance to play.

Simmons Field was awash in sunshine, warmed with temperatures in the upper 70s accompanied by a cool breeze during the softball “border battle” between the fire departments of Kenosha and Racine Sunday afternoon.          The perfect weather brought out hundreds of fans of both teams showing their support for the respective teams who came together to raise funds for the family of John Hetland, a Racine police officer who was killed while trying to stop a robbery at a Racine tavern on June 17. Hetland was off duty that night.          With a massive investigation involving 17 law enforcement agencies, DNA evidence was used to arrest Dalquavis T. Ward, 26, of Milwaukee, for Hetland’s murder on June 26. He was charged a day later with first-degree intentional homicide with use of a dangerous weapon, armed robbery and possession of a firearm by a felon.          Racine native Nick Keeran, a Kenosha firefighter, organized the event and played in the game Sunday, which the Racine Fire Department won 13-12.          “This started a few years ago and we would play just a fun game against Kenosha Police right around this weekend, but this is a busy weekend for the police so it’s really hard to schedule it. So, unfortunately, they couldn’t do it this year,” he said.          Keeran said that, because the team has a lot of friends on the Racine Fire Department, they engaged them in the discussions.          “We threw it out there and asked them if they just wanted to play a fun game and call it a border battle and make it a fun thing,” he said.          But then, when the tragedy struck, Keeran, who knew Hetland, said he wanted to do something to help his family. Keeran said the owner and bartender of Teezers, where the fatal shooting occurred, is also a good friend of his.          “So, this was a little personal for me,” he said.          As soon as it happened, he said he reached out to the Racine Fire Department’s softball team and proposed the idea to hold the fundraiser for Hetland’s family and his kids.          “Of course, they were on board immediately,” he said. “We kind of threw it together quickly, but it turned out to be something really cool.”          Along with the game itself, the two departments sold T-shirts made for the event — red for Kenosha, blue for Racine — and held a 50-50 raffle along with donations from local businesses.          Keeran didn’t have an estimate yet of how much had been raised as supporters continued to purchase T-shirts even after the game.          “Hopefully, (we raised) a lot. We’re happy with anything,” he said. “It’s a great turnout. … I wished we could’ve pulled it off (and won).”          Jose Carbajal, president of Local 321, the Racine firefighters’ union, who also played in Sunday’s game, said he had fun playing for a good cause.          “Kenosha’s got a solid team. We know they can hit the ball well,” he said. “We got a lot of history with Kenosha; they’re always good to us.”          Carbajal said the two sides do many fundraisers and charity events together. Carbajal, whose father was police officer, also knew Hetland when he was a new officer and recalled how his father and Hetland had played in the “industrial” softball tournaments in Racine.          “It was one of the first years Hetland was on the job,” he said, remembering that Hetland was also a good softball player.          He said that the veteran officer was 15 months away from retirement.          “He was a really good guy,” he said.          In the stands, Chris Daugherty, of Kenosha, a former first responder for Scout Leaders Rescue Squad, rooted hard for the Kenosha Fire Department team. Although she did not know Hetland, she has known those who have risked their lives and were killed doing their job.          “Law enforcement, fire department — they have my utmost respect,” she said. “They don’t get enough appreciation for what they do.”          Denton Richards, of Racine, who was pulling for the Racine Fire Department, said he appreciated what the two sides did to coordinate the event.          “I think it’s a fantastic thing, what they did for them. The (Hetland) family’s been through a lot and to see both Racine and Kenosha come together to help them out, it’s a great thing,” he said.

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — Von Miller was primed for a monster comeback in 2020 after packing on the muscle this spring, doubling down on his leadership duties after watching Kobe Bryant’s funeral and Michael Jordan’s documentary, then absolutely destroying offensive drills every day at training camp. It all crumbled when the Super Bowl 50 MVP suffered a serious ankle injury at an indoor practice Tuesday, almost certainly costing him a chance to atone for last season’s drop-off that helped fuel his offseason rededication. “It was just a normal play,” coach Vic Fangio said Wednesday. “He just rushed around the edge and never hit the ground, never looked bad. If you saw the video you’d think nothing happened, but it did.” Miller is seeking additional medical advice before undergoing surgery and is expected to miss the season. “I’m sad that he’s not going to get the season that he worked for because it would have been fun to watch,” Fangio said. “For me. For him. For you. For everybody.” Malik Reed and Jeremiah Attaochu, who filled the void when Miller’s pass rushing partner Bradley Chubb tore an ACL a year ago, will share the workload now. Fangio stressed, however, that they’re not the only ones who will have to step up their game on the field or in the huddle. “The whole team has to pick up the void,” Fangio said. “It’s not the player that ends up playing for him. It’s not the defense, it’s not the offense, it’s not the special teams. It’s everybody. When you lose a player of that caliber, everybody’s got to pick up the slack -- in all facets -- on the field and off the field, in the locker room. “And we have a good enough team to do that. If you’re a good enough team you can overcome these injuries. There’s...

WARREN, Mich. (AP) — Joe Biden used suburban Detroit as a backdrop Wednesday to make a direct appeal to blue-collar workers who might have voted Republican four years ago but now regret it — attempting to rebuild the Democratic “blue wall” that crumbled four years ago and helped catapult Donald Trump to the White House.The former vice president’s first pandemic-era campaign trips beyond his home in Delaware have been to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, an indication of how closely Biden’s electoral prospects are tied to winning back those formerly reliably Democratic states.Biden was in Warren, an area whose economy is heavily dependent on the auto industry, and pledged to rewrite tax codes to reward U.S. companies that invest in domestic manufacturing while imposing penalties on those that send jobs to other countries.He noted that a local General Motors transmission plant closed last year despite Trump’s pledges to protect Michigan jobs and added, “I bet the workers around here weren’t all that comforted by Trump’s empty promises.”“Under Donald Trump, Michigan lost auto jobs even before COVID hit,” Biden said. “And what about offshoring? Has Trump delivered on stopping companies from shipping American jobs overseas? You already know the answer to that. Of course not.”Last week, Biden went to Wisconsin and was followed quickly by running mate Kamala Harris, who held her own Labor Day events there. Biden hit Pennsylvania during the holiday and will be back on Friday.Trump is countering with his own trip to Michigan on Thursday and also will be in Pennsylvania himself the following day.Though the Biden campaign often emphasizes that it sees multiple ways to secure the 270 Electoral College votes it needs to win in November, the quickest path runs through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.“If Biden wins any of them — but particularly any two, with some of the other states that are in play — it’s pretty impossible for Trump to win the Electoral College,” said veteran Democratic strategist Joe Trippi.Biden’s aides believe his focus on the economy and Trump’s handling of the coronavirus will resonate with key voters nationwide but particularly in states like Michigan, which took one of the sharpest hits nationally from the pandemic.The state’s unemployment rate spiked at 24% in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has since recovered to 8.7%, but Michigan has nearly 414,500 fewer jobs than it did when Trump was inaugurated.Previewing the president’s own trip, the Trump campaign looked to paint Biden as deferential on China, arguing that he cost American industrial workers their jobs. Trump’s allies have long credited his hawkish China stance in 2016 as helping him win the industrial Midwest, which suffered job losses overseas that Trump blamed on Obama-era trade policies.Trump aides have frequently repeated claims about Biden’s ties to Beijing, but that’s proven problematic in light of Trump’s own kind words for China earlier this year in the early days of the pandemic. They have also ignored the Obama-Biden administration’s efforts to save the American automotive industry, based in Michigan, after 2008′s recession.“Joe Biden is going to the state of Michigan to pretend to be a friend and ally to workers in the industrial heartland,” said Steve Cortes, Trump campaign senior adviser, “but he has proven over and over that he is a globalist and a corporatist who, as senator from Delaware, well represented corporate interests over American workers.”Biden, by contrast, stressed the Obama White House’s efforts to revive the auto industry, saying, “President Trump has broken just about every promise he’s made to the American worker.”“He’s failed our economy and our country,” Biden said Wednesday, promising to create a “Made in America” office within the White House Office of Management and Budget to ensure government projects use resources made domestically.Trump supporters maintain that the president has fulfilled his job creation promises and was only temporarily sidetracked by the pandemic. But the jobs numbers show that hiring at factories across the Midwest — including in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin — began to stall and then decline in the summer of 2019.Trump won Michigan by the narrowest margin of any state in 2016 — fewer than 11,000 votes — and Democrats made huge gains there in the midterms, winning every major statewide office and a handful of congressional seats as well.Indeed, Democrats see reasons for optimism in the party’s gains during the 2018 midterms in all three states, which were powered in part by an exodus of suburban women from the GOP. And they believe that a stronger emphasis on minority turnout — with Harris, the first African-American woman on a major ticket, focused heavily on Black voters in key states — will help Biden make up some of the ground Clinton lost in 2016.“The campaign’s taking it more seriously from the start than national Democrats did four years ago,” said Amy Chapman, who worked as Barack Obama’s Michigan state director in 2008. “They started doing advertising earlier than they did last cycle — last cycle they were only up at the very end — and the ads show what Biden would do, as well as showing a contrast with Trump.”The Biden campaign is heavily outspending the Trump campaign on-air in all three states. Since Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee in early April, his campaign has spent about $59.8 million to the Trump campaign’s nearly $26.8 million across the states, according to the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG. The difference is starkest in Michigan, where the Biden campaign has spent $17.2 million to Trump’s $6.7 million.For future spending, however, the two come about even, with Biden reserving $33.5 million on air and Trump reserving $32.7 million across all three states.After overlapping in Michigan by barely 24 hours, Trump and Biden will both be in Pennsylvania on Friday at a Sept. 11 memorial in Shanksville, the site of the 2001 crash of United Flight 93.Republicans also argue that a robust, in-person field operation in the Midwestern battlegrounds gives them an advantage over Democrats, who are still doing most of their organizing online out of concern for public safety during the pandemic.___Weissert reported from Washington.

Fangio stressed, however, that they’re not the only ones who will have to step up their game on the field or in the huddle.           “The whole team has to pick up the void,” Fangio said. “It’s not the player that ends up playing for him. It’s not the defense, it’s not the offense, it’s not the special teams. It’s everybody. When you lose a player of that caliber, everybody’s got to pick up the slack -- in all facets -- on the field and off the field, in the locker room.           “And we have a good enough team to do that. If you’re a good enough team you can overcome these injuries. There’s countless examples of that over the years, very recently, very long time ago, any time you want to look at, there’s been these types of injuries that teams have overcome and still had successful seasons,” Fangio added.           “And we want to be added to that list.”          Fangio noted the Broncos went 7-5 last year after losing Chubb in Week 4.          “We played our best football after that, and that’s not because we didn’t have Bradley; we just kept developing as a team and we compensated for him,” Fangio said. “And we have a better team this year overall. So, I expect us to still be a good team without Von.”          There’s no denying, however, that it just got a whole lot tougher for the Broncos to return to the playoffs this year and avoid becoming the first Super Bowl champion to spend the following five seasons missing out on the playoffs altogether.

The Florida Department of Health released a report that detailed coronavirus cases linked to schools on Aug. 24 — reporting that 194 students tested positive in cases associated with primary and secondary schools — but it was quickly yanked from public view. Moscoso said the report was released "inadvertently," and DeSantis said the report "was not necessarily accurate."          Many schools send individual emails to parents if cases are detected in their child's school, but it's not required by the state, and the information is not made available to the general public.          Martin County, north of Palm Beach, opened Aug. 11. Students at SeaWind Elementary School in Hobe Sound were sent home to quarantine the next day. Within a week, the district told local news outlets that it sent 292 students and 14 teachers from five schools to quarantine. However, the school district does not have a coronavirus dashboard and hasn't released numbers since then.

Even the most disciplined and effective candidate would struggle in a time of a public health and economic crisis. And Trump is one of the least disciplined candidates we've ever seen. The time for his campaign is right now. But can he drive a consistent narrative and not chase every last grievance? Or will he continue to lash out and let negative news about him define the race? History tells us that it's much more likely to be the latter.

The main fault in the chemistry of "Broken Hearts Gallery" is that Viswanathan's male companions come off like drips compared to her.

In Viswanathan's scenes with the terrifically droll Arturo Castro ("Broad City"), there are hints of a funnier, more satirical and less sincere film. To her credit, Viswanathan never seems to believe all that much really hinges on these relationships. "Broken Hearts Gallery" flirts with cynicism, but I wish it fell head over heels.

"Our workforce, like many others, have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, which has resulted in certain service disruptions," USPS spokesman David Partenheimer said in a statement. He added they are "aggressively working to ensure full service coverage across the network," and touted recent performance data that showed improvements in mail delivery.          But Warren and Casey still put much of the blame on DeJoy, pointing to his earlier contention that the new agency practices "should not have impacted anybody." Investigators noted that their inquiry showed that only one of the pharmacies contacted had experienced no significant disruption during the summer — and that the provider said it did not rely extensively on USPS. The company is not named in the report, but Walgreens said in a separate statement that only an "extremely small percentage" of its prescriptions are handled by the Postal Service.          Warren and Casey urged the USPS board to take immediate action, stressing that its "failure to fix the service delays caused by Postmaster General DeJoy represent an ongoing public health threat and a dereliction of your responsibility to the American public." Warren added in a statement that DeJoy should resign or be fired.          The Senate Democrats' findings threaten to add to the headaches already facing DeJoy, whose changes to the mail service in the name of austerity have evoked widespread suspicion and condemnation. On Monday, top House Democrats opened their own investigation, focusing on reports that DeJoy urged employees at his former business to donate to GOP candidates, then boosted their pay. Lawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee have raised the possibility that DeJoy misled them under oath.          The congressional scrutiny began almost as soon as DeJoy assumed the title of postmaster general on June 15. The ally of President Donald Trump and former top Republican fundraiser set about seeking to right the budget of USPS, which has racked up $160.9 billion in debt amid declines in first-class mail delivery and the spiraling cost of retirement benefits.          But DeJoy's initiatives, including planned service reductions and the removal of mailboxes, sparked backlash particularly among Democrats, who feared they could undermine the 2020 presidential election — particularly because Trump has openly has sought to discredit voting by mail, claiming without evidence that it will lead to rampant fraud.

BLACKSBURG – How confident is Whit Babcock in Virginia Tech's testing procedures and protocols, as the Virginia Tech football team gets ready to kick off August practices in the COVID-19 pandemic era? The Virginia Tech Director of Athletics would have no concerns if his oldest son were on the team. "I'm also a parent of a Division I student-athlete [a football player at William & Mary] whom I love more than anything in the world, and I would put him in our protocol any day of the week and sleep very soundly," Babcock said. That message and many others came out during an hourlong Zoom conference between Babcock, Dr. Mark Rogers (Tech's Chief Medical Officer) and members of the media Wednesday afternoon. The bulk of the questions centered around COVID-19 and Virginia Tech's efforts to protect its student-athletes. This came into the spotlight Monday when football standout Caleb Farley wrote in an NBC Sports article that part of his reasoning for opting out of the 2020 season was concern over Tech's procedures and protocols. Virginia Tech head coach Justin Fuente talked with Farley on Monday afternoon before releasing a statement, supporting Farley as a player and individual, while also supporting the efforts of Tech's sports medicine staff. Rogers also released a statement Monday about Tech's protocols. Then Wednesday, Rogers and Babcock rigorously defended the athletics department's efforts. To start, Virginia Tech tests each student-athlete once he or she comes back to campus to resume workouts and then conducts a follow-up test two weeks later. A percentage of the school's student-athletes then get tested randomly along the way. And that's just during the preseason. "The ACC and NCAA have recommendations, and we're following all of those – and even actually a little bit more," Rogers said. "Once we get into the season, the NCAA and ACC have risk stratified all these sports into high risk, intermediate risk, and low risk. The high risk sports would get weekly testing three days before the competition, and that includes anyone that would be essential personnel [coaches, support staff, etc.]. "Preseason and out of season, we're testing more than what the ACC is recommending right now." Also, the sports medicine staff has been executing an aggressive education plan on the disease. Doctors and trainers have sent out videos and held multiple Zoom conferences with athletes and coaches. Signage exists throughout the athletics facilities reminding athletes to wear masks, wash their hands, and distance themselves. The staff even walks through locker rooms and calls out athletes who aren't adhering to protocols. "It's a consistent message that they've been getting since they came on campus, and a lot of that even began before they came back to campus," Rogers said. In addition, Tech's sports staff continue to conduct workouts outside or within the Beamer-Lawson Indoor Practice Facility – strong air circulation helps prevent the spread of the virus. The indoor facility has six large garage-like doors that open to allow access to the outdoor practice field, and more importantly, allow air to circulate within the building. Farley had questioned having 100-plus players gather in the space for workouts and walkthroughs – but Tech Athletics had received prior approval from health officials to do this before the players returned to campus. "The health department and campus approved it," Rogers said. Rogers, Babcock, and the sports medicine staff are gearing up for potential risks, as more than 30,000 students get ready to return to campus in the next two weeks to resume classes. Obviously, the additional people bring added risk, particularly those who come from areas where the disease has been prevalent. Tech's student-athletes will continue to be reminded to avoid highly populated areas, especially any parties or the overall downtown scene. "That's a part of college life, but it doesn't have to be," Rogers said. "That's a physical choice that they're going to have to make. If they're conscientious about their goals, then obviously, they want to go to class, and if they want to play a sport, then those are the two highest priorities to keep themselves safe and the community safe. That's going to have to be a priority of the student-athletes – what they want their focus to be." ACC presidents have cleared member schools to begin fall sports starting in early September. They approved a 11-game football schedule that includes 10 conference games and one nonconference game. Of course, everything is subject to change in today's world, but Rogers thinks that the Tech sports medicine staff has created the safest possible environment for sports – with flexibility to do even more if health officials ask. "I think we're doing as much as we can to keep it as safe as we can and operating under the assumption that our student-athletes want to perform," he said. "It's our job as a sports medicine team to make it as safe as we can, so that they can perform. We've talked that, on the sports field and certainly outside the sports field, there is a risk for COVID. I think we just need to be smart and take as many precautions as we can and leave it to the experts to kind of move forward." Babcock has been focused on doing his part to help his staff create the safest environment possible for the student-athletes. He also faces the added challenge of trying to make sure that the department remains secure from a financial perspective. Schools around the nation have been cutting sports, while furloughing employees and eliminating positions – all to save money. Virginia Tech Athletics hasn't gotten to that point, but Babcock knows there will be a negative impact. "It is deeply concerning," he said. "We have nearly a $100 million budget. I believe that impact will be better known later in the year when campus gets up and running. Can we have games? The ticket component will take a hit. Will television [take a hit]? Will advertising? There is a big financial component. Not to trump health, but the financial component is big. We're trying to make it work to where we can provide opportunities for all these student-athletes. Outside of football, too. So there is a lot of pressure on the health side and a lot of pressure financially." Babcock hopes that the coming days provide a little more certainty. For sure, in that respect, he's like everyone else in college athletics these days.
