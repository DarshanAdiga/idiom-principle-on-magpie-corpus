Pinnacle Bankshares President and CEO Todd Hall said in a news release the company has been consumed with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related changes to operations. Among other things, the company set aside $115,000 during the first quarter for potential problem loans, up from $6,000 during the first quarter last year.
 "We continue to monitor the pandemic and its effects on our economy, while taking steps to safeguard our customers, employees and shareholders during this difficult time. Fortunately, Pinnacle was in a strong position at the beginning of the crisis and stands ready to weather the storm," Hall said.

Some potential negative COVID-19 financial impacts are predictable. Obviously, if consumer spending is down because all but essential businesses are shuttered or functioning at reduced capacity, state sales tax sharing revenues will be down. Gas consumption is reportedly falling. This impacts money available for roads and bridges. Unemployment is rising exponentially. As fewer people meet the thresholds for paying state income taxes, Idaho, and therefore probably her cities, will feel the impact in lost revenues. Fewer federal taxes due to catastrophically increased unemployment may mean less revenue- sharing from the federal level. You get the picture.
 During this year’s state legislative session, Gov. Brad Little asked each state government department to present a budget reflecting a 2 percent reduction. Now he has asked for another 3 percent for a total of 5 percent. Idaho State’s President Kevin Satterlee has also called for budget reductions as high as 6 percent. Proposed state and institutional budget reductions proactively anticipate possible negative economic impacts on state revenues.
 Our city must take a similar approach. We, who make decisions and ask for increases in expenditures must intensify our efforts to streamline city operations and harvest every reasonable savings on behalf of our taxpayers. We must weigh every expenditure and financial practice with extreme care and ensure our budgeting processes are well-honed, stringent and as equitable as possible across all employee groups.
 I am in no way suggesting our city employees are not conscious of the need to steward public money responsibly. I believe they are. However, we must now function outside our comfortable norm and dig deeper than ever before to find savings from every nook and cranny of our city government.

If the temporary hospital is needed, Ryan said the staffing plan is to have health alliance nurses overseeing the care while community care providers would be engaged to help, including nurses that provide home care and personal support workers.
 If the hospital reaches maximum capacity, he said some of the least acute patients, who are close to being discharged from hospital and just need a little more care, would go to the field hospital.
 Nearby Windsor and Sarnia have been hit a lot harder by the pandemic than Chatham-Kent.
 When asked if the field hospital could be used if hospitals in those cities get overwhelmed, Ryan said "there's the potential of moving patients to other hospitals" since any hospital bed in Ontario is a provincial asset.
 He added the need for that hasn't been seen yet.
 Ryan said the Ministry of Health has indicated funding is available to reimburse health-care facilities for setting up field hospitals.
 He credits the willingness of St. Clair College to provide the HealthPlex to house the temporary hospital.
 "It's just a great sign of community help. They just basically turned that facility over to us and helped us as much as possible," he said. "They've just been really great partners to work with."
 Ryan said the pandemic has created an unprecedented situation, which can change quickly.
 He said the current lease agreement for the HealthPlex is until June 30 but, "like everything else, it's up in the air."

Covid-19 challenges the heart and soul of America and of Ashland. Everything has changed.  
 Trouble tests who we are as individuals and as a community.  
 National crises are not new, but it has been a while since the 2007-10 economic recession. Since 1914, we all name the same major world-wide crises that include the world wars and the 1918 Flu. Other intense national times of trouble, including the Great Depression, also come to mind; but unless we were scarred by those events, they have for the most part, faded from our memories. This is new territory for us.  
 State and national issues are important, but our focus right now must be on Ashland. We must do this not for selfish reasons, but because what we think and do in the next six months will set the direction of the attitude and atmosphere for years to come in our own community. This decision will impact Ashland, whether for good or bad.  
 The question is, "What will we do when we are released from the confines of our four walls?"  
 Let's not forget that regardless of the current pandemic and the negative economic realities, for many years Ashland community leaders and people have poured sweat and tears into molding the heart of our community. Ashland has been growing, remodeling and re-investing its resources, making Ashland a better place to live and hang out.  
 Even now, additional downtown landscaping and walking areas are being developed where the former Myer Pump buildings once stood and to the area east of the Dairy Queen. These efforts will make it easier to connect as a community, even while practicing social distancing.  
 Our challenge is that once we are given the green light, we must purposeful and intentionally contend for not only Ashland's brick and mortar, but for its heart.  
 We can choose, if we determine in our heart to do so, to stay on course and continue to build on all that has been done, in addition to continuing to add to it the most important part -- the spiritual soul of Ashland.  
 We often say of a sports team, industry or even a country that it has gained or lost its heart or soul. That means something. It's intangible. It's spiritual. It's the foundation of all other good things that make or break that team, industry or culture.  
 In that phrase are embedded words like hope and sharing, love and friendship, caring and safety -- a belief that we will all stand together in times of distress.  
 These words are not money words. You can't buy a city's soul. These are spiritual realities.  
 Ashland has a heart and soul, and in 2020 we will have an opportunity to prove that it is deeper than friendly smiles.  
 A good soul is grounded in the spiritual reality that we must choose to acknowledge Jesus both as a community and as individuals.  
 Ashland has been embracing this spiritual reality, as evidenced by the number of those who are willing to boldly state their dependence on Jesus.  
 What Ashland looks like in the next few years depends on us individually to acknowledge the spiritual reality that will set the right attitudes for our community for the here and now, and that also will endure forever.  
 It's an intentional decision.

Don't be afraid to cuddle your cat or pet your pooch while you're homebound.
 There's no need to worry about getting COVID-19 from a household animal, said Dr. David Colby, Chatham-Kent's medical officer of health.
 "There is some evidence that cats are susceptible to coronavirus, and there have been a couple of cases in dogs as well," he said, "but there have been no cases anywhere in the world where the source of a human infection has been a companion animal or any type of animal.
 "It seems to be that animals can occasionally acquire coronavirus from humans, but, by and large, they don't seem to get very sick with that."
 The first confirmed cases of pets with the coronavirus in the United States were reported this week in New York state after two cats tested positive. The cats had mild respiratory illnesses and are expected to make a full recovery, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 "People need to take care of their animals, not fear them in any way, and if people want to adopt a pet right now, there's no reason not to do that," Colby said. "There is a very soft recommendation that if people have an active coronavirus connection, that they try and avoid cuddling their pet too much so that the pet doesn't get it in case there's something we don't know. But again I need to reassure everyone that companion animals and other animals are not a hazard to humans.
 "We depend on our animals for companionship during times of isolation and inactivity that we're all dealing with right now. They are a tremendous comfort and a blessing for all of us."
 Colby was also asked during a conference call with media Thursday about when the restrictions in Ontario may be loosened. He echoed a warning by the province's chief medical officer, Dr. David Williams, that can't happen until the number of daily new cases drops significantly.
 "He has basically said that we're not going to open Ontario up for business until our daily new cases drop below 200 in the province," Colby said. "Right now, they're over 500, so we've got a ways to go before we're going to see things open up.
 "But as things improve, I suspect that what we'll see, just like we saw a gradual tightening of things as people became more aware of what was going on in the province, we'll also see a gradual loosening. So, it won't be the sudden lifting of all of our restrictions that we're living with now and, quite frankly, all tired of.
 "Businesses are suffering, people are suffering. But we're afraid that people are going to suffer more if this virus runs rampant through our communities, so we need to keep these social distancing rules in place for the time being."

Bright's decision to go public is now exposing months of turmoil inside one of the key divisions at the Department of Health and Human Services charged with responding to the coronavirus pandemic. His allegations raise serious questions about political bias creeping into the government's response to the pandemic and the extent to which Trump's preferences for a drug overshadowed its scientific merits. (Diamond, Collins and Hoye, 4/23)


--DocBreak--
It is hard to decide what is more troubling during the new coronavirus crisis, the angry protesters demanding that businesses be reopened, or the handful of governors who seem captive to their premature demands.  
 Many protesters have ignored public health edicts, exposed themselves and others to COVID-19, and put our nation's hodgepodge efforts to mitigate the pandemic at risk.  
 They could be dismissed as the fed-up eruptions of a relative few. But their demonstrations are large enough that one or more could be the conduit for a regional escalation of the coronavirus. They are without doubt infecting certain politicians, who are spreading the disease to others in the form of plans to reopen businesses before it is safe to do so.  
 Florida and Georgia, two states where Trump-allied governors have announced reopening plans, might not have reached a peak in the spread of the disease, let alone the 14 days of decline specified in White House guidelines. In both states, the number of new coronavirus cases has trickled up again in recent days after showing some modest progress.  
 Kentucky, which has not announced any plans to reopen, experienced its worst COVID-19 day on Sunday, after boisterous protesters poured into the state capital of Frankfort last week.  
 Americans are blessed with rights of speech and assembly, but they are not given rights to put others at risk of falling ill and even dying.  
 No one likes the stay-at-home orders and the edicts that restaurants, entertainment venues and other public spaces remain closed. The economic harm is real and enormous. Nonetheless, in the absence of a vaccine or proven treatment for COVID-19, the restrictions are effective and necessary for the time being.  
 Had states acted earlier, not only would the death count be lower now, but also the leading-edge states would likely be seeing their numbers dropping faster and would be able to contemplate some limited reopening without inviting a second wave.  
 A rush to reopen now could mean that case declines in the early and hard-hit states like California, New York and Louisiana are offset by increasing numbers in the more cavalier states. The virus doesn't recognize state lines. What happens in Georgia doesn't necessarily stay in Georgia.  
 Premature reopenings could push back the real date at which the nation's economy can recover, which is not when politicians decree it but when most everyday Americans feel safe going into restaurants, getting on airplanes and such.  
 In addition to being hazardous to public health, the lockdown protests reflect a sorry strain of contemporary American conservatism. When Ronald Reagan was president, conservatism was brash, confident and very much in the ascendancy. Now it is increasingly angry, defensive and disinterested in reason.  
 At a rally in Austin, Texas, protesters were shouting, "Fire Fauci!" The government's top expert on infectious disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has rankled some because he delivers sound, science-based answers, not false hope or political spin.  
 In Lansing, Michigan, protesters blocked streets that ambulances need to get to and from a nearby hospital. In Kentucky, they drowned out the governor trying to hold a news briefing on the pandemic's latest developments. And in multiple locations they've shown up brandishing firearms.  
 News reports suggest that many of the protests aren't spontaneous but have backing from groups, endowed by a few wealthy individuals, that try to create popular uprisings around far-right principles, or at least make it look like these principles have more support than they do.  
 Enough already. Enough of these people doing public harm while wrapping themselves in First Amendment (and Second Amendment) garb. Enough of right- wing billionaires trying to manipulate public opinion. And enough of politicians playing the role of puppets when they should be leading. As New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo put it Wednesday, "This is no time to act stupidly. Period."

While the coronavirus pandemic has slowed activity in Athens to a crawl, it's actually allowed some Athens-Clarke County projects projects to speed up -- a faint silver lining in the continuing crisis.
   
 With hardly any traffic in downtown Athens this month after most businesses closed and sent employees home, Athens-Clarke workers have nearly finished the underground part of a streetscape project along a stretch of Clayton Street, for example.
   
 Light traffic has also allowed workers to speed up a stormwater project around Lumpkin and Baxter streets.
   
 Workers had to resolve dozens of conflicts in a maze of underground wires and pipes
   
 More projects will be coming up soon as well -- construction of a new section of the Firefly Trail and runway work at Athens-Ben Epps airport, both likely to be approved by the Athens-Clarke Commission in its next meeting.
   
 The absence of vehicle traffic is also an opportunity to get contractors and Athens-Clarke workers going on projects such as road repairs, sidewalk construction and emergency replacements of collapsed stormwater drains underneath some streets, like the fallen pipe that's closed off a section of Athena Drive for weeks.
   
 Many big corrugated metal pipes installed in the 1980s and 1990s have now reached the end of their useful lives, according to Athens-Clarke County Manager Blaine Williams.
   
 Athens-Clarke adopted new operating procedures as the city came under a local, then state emergency declaration that mandated sheltering in place and social distancing.
   
 Government offices closed as administrators figured out how much could be shifted online -- and how to continue operations like street work that can't be done online.
   
 "We had to figure out a way to be safe," said Athens-Clarke County Manager Blaine Williams.
   
 That's been true not only of streets and drainage work, where normally workers come into close contact, but with other kinds of government services, some critical for the city, including 24-hour-a-day operations like keeping the flow of drinking water going and making sure Athens-Clarke County's wastewater treatment plants can continue treating the never-ending rivers of water coming from our toilets, showers and businesses.
   
 One measure the government took was to divide workers up into rotating teams, so that if someone became infected with the virus that causes the COVID-19 illness, only that group of workers would have to be quarantined from jobs that can't be done at home.
   
 "Not everyone can telework from home," he said. "We can't afford for your water not to come on."
   
 So far, those essential services have gone on without missing a beat.
   
 "They really are the unsung heroes of what's going on here," Williams said of the people who are keeping those essential services going.
   
 By the end of this month, the stage on Clayton Street will be set for the next, above-ground phase of the streetscape project. Plans include reducing a portion of the street from three lanes to two, wider sidewalks and installing art.
   
 Meanwhile, backlogs are building for operations such as the Athens-Clarke landfill.
   
 With most of Athens sheltering in place, many, including Williams, have taken the opportunity to clean house, he said. Though many cities have shut down their recycling and leaf-and-limb collection operations, Athens has continued with those, along with regular garbage pickups.
   
 But after emergency orders, traffic spiked at the Lexington Road landfill Athens-Clarke shares with Oglethorpe County. That forced the Athens-Clarke Solid Waste Department to begin scheduling trips to the landfill by appointment, Williams said.
   
 Athens-Clarke's Center for Hard to Recycle Materials will also reopen beginning April 29 to take foam plastic, old computers and other items that can't go into the regular recycling stream.
   
 But that's also going to require scheduling appointments at the facility's web page, athensclarkecounty.com/5894/CHaRM.
   
 Athens Area Chamber of Commerce President and CEO David Bradley noted another building backlog in a chamber-sponsored Zoom meeting this week -- unwanted items that people want to donate to thrift stores. Thrift stores are closed, and most aren't accepting donations,another river that's dammed up for now.
   
 Backlogs are also building up in other areas, including courts, which have temporarily suspended eviction hearings and some other court proceedings.
   
 Unlike some, Williams isn't holding out hope for a quick return to normal.
   
 "I think we're looking at three, four, six months," he said.
   
 Now Williams and others are wondering whether the University of Georgia will be starting fall classes on schedule in August. With nearly 40,000 students absent, UGA students represent nearly a third of the Athens-Clarke County population. Their absence would keep a lot of cars off the road, but inflict even more damage on the Athens economy.
   
 With limited exceptions, UGA won't have in-person classes on campus this summer, but is so far scheduled to begin fall semester on Aug. 20. But many universities around the country are already discussing whether they might begin their fall semesters online.
