As reported earlier this week by Joe Cowley of the _Chicago Sun-Times_, Markkanen was the "quiet storm" brewing behind the scenes amid the Bulls' struggles this season -- a contrast to teammate Denzel Valentine, who was far more open to the press about his unhappiness with the Bulls and their coaching staff. But while Markkanen chose to keep a low profile regarding his supposed frustration with his role on the team and the offensive schemes favored by head coach Jim Boylen, Cowley stressed that the Finnish big man was "one unhappy camper" before the 2019-20 season was suspended.

Solskjaer is adored by United's fans and that does count for something. Solskjaer kept Michael Carrick at the club and brought Mike Phelan back, while Nicky Butt was promoted to the position of head of first-team development on the Norwegian's watch.
 There have been ups and downs since Solskjaer's appointment but he has restored a feel-good factor to the club and it's supporters and, before the season was put on hold, there were huge signs of encouragement that his hard work was starting to bear fruit.
 When the campaign resumes, it will resume with United on an 11-game unbeaten run after a sequence of eight wins and three draws that included two victories over Manchester City and one over Chelsea.
 It will resume with United boasting a squad that includes five players signed by Solskjaer who have all improved the team, and it will also likely resume with a fit Marcus Rashford back in the team.
 Rashford has done so much to help Manchester during the coronavirus pandemic and Solskjaer has done so much to help Rashford realise his potential at United. Rashford's Old Trafford career stalled under Jose Mourinho but it reignited under Solskjaer and he is now, unquestionably, one of the best players in the Premier League.

Until all of those that need to be tested can be tested, we have no other defense than to be extremely strict in our policy toward physical interactions. If we do not act now and have everyone limit their physical contacts and exposure, I remain extremely concerned that we will not have enough personal protective equipment (PPE), nor ICU bed space, nor ventilators, nor personnel to care for what could be a tidal wave of patients at our local hospitals.
 On a positive, proactive note, we have instituted strict policies at the local hospitals. The are no visitors allowed, and all personnel including physicians, nurses, other healthcare workers, staff and patients are all screeened with in-depth questionnaires and temperature testing, before being admitted into the facilities. Likewise, all of our fire and EMS public safety crews are screened twice a day to insure the public is safe.
 My personal recommendations, as well as those of my professional medical colleagues, involve limiting trips out of the home to no more than once a week, and only for absolute necessities. This needs to be followed for the health, welfare, and safety of our citizens. People may want to consume a particular item on a particular day. Unfortunately, this is not realistic if we are going to provide the best chances for making it through and surviving this pandemic. Be part of the narrative where you can tell your grandchildren that you made a difference, when you were being counted on to step up and sacrifice for the greater good. Plan ahead, do the right thing, stay home, and be part of the solution.

It was a sensational contest between the Undertaker and AJ Styles but the Phenom showed why he was the best when it came to the grandest stage of them all, putting down the Phenomenal One in a Boneyard match. A rare contest, the Boneyard match was a trap that AJ Styles had set up for himself, thinking he could get the better of the Deadman. Despite receiving help from his OC brothers Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson,  the Undertaker managed to put away AJ Styles, doing as he promised after weeks of vicious and stinging attacks from the latter on RAW. A chokeslam from the top of a building finished things off the proceedings for the Undertaker following which he buried AJ Styles, putting him to rest.

On day one of 'Wrestlemania 36', the Undertaker battled it out with AJ Styles, and the former made his entry in his trademark style, giving fans some major nostalgia.
 The Undertaker and AJ Styles battled it out in a 'Boneyard Match' and it was the former who came out triumphant, cementing his almost perfect Wrestlemania record.
 Seth Rollins battled it out with Kevin Owens, and later on, the clash got converted into a 'No-disqualification match'.
 For the 'Universal Championship', Goldberg and Braun Strowman battled it out, and it was the latter who won the title in under three minutes.
 Earlier, the WWE had decided to go ahead with Wrestlemania behind closed doors.
 "We believe that in this time, especially right now with all this uncertainty ... that there is a need for escapism and for people to be able to get away from all this and put it behind them," Levesque had told CNN.
 "We feel an obligation in some way to try and continue to provide entertainment to people. It''s our company mission to put smiles on people''s faces, and we are continuing to try to do that," he added.
 The day two of the show will be held on Sunday (local time), and stars like Brock Lesnar, Edge and Randy Orton will be headlining the show.
 As WWE went ahead with the Wrestlemania, the company has received mixed reviews as many have criticised the decision as the USA continues to battle the coronavirus crisis.
