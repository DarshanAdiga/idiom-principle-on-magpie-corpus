Karisma's life, in a nutshell, was mainly traumatic post her success as an actress. Apart from a few updates on Instagram, we don't really know who Karisma Kapoor is anymore. At a time, when the audience is relating to more relatable content, this might be Karisma's chance to shine again and through Mentalhood, shatter the image of the happy housewife she once played in Hum Saath Saath Hain. Let's face it, the Barjatiya morality has only done more harm than good (especially in the lives of women.)But finally, in Mentalhood, she might be seen in a different mother.

HECKER, Ill. -- The first fingernail tattoo started off as a joke by a man who lost the tips of two fingers in a construction accident in 2018.      But that shifted after Eric Catalano, an auto finance manager turned tattoo artist, finished with his needle.   "The mood changed in here," Catalano recalled as he stood in his Eternal Ink Tattoo Studio. "Everything turned from funny to wow."      When Catalano posted a photo of the inked fingernails online last January, he thought maybe 300 people would like the realistic tattoo. He had no idea the image would be viewed by millions of people around the world. Even "Ripley's Believe It or Not!" tracked him down to feature the viral tattoo: a pair of fingernails that looked so real no one could believe their eyes.      The viral photo pushed Catalano, 39, further into the world of paramedical tattooing. Now people with life-altering scars come from as far as Ireland to visit Catalano's tattoo shop in this rural village about 30 miles outside St. Louis. They enter Eternal Ink looking for the healing touch they saw online. With flesh-toned ink and a needle, Catalano makes his clients feel whole again with an art form and industry that picks up where doctors leave off.      Catalano is known for his talent with intricate fingernails and filling in the blanks left empty by accidents or surgeries, but other paramedical tattoo artists also are trying out flesh-toned pigments to camouflage imperfections, scars and discolorations for all skin colors.      Using tattoos to blend in rather than stand out is a relatively new field. A school started outside Atlanta about four years ago has trained more than 100 aspiring paramedical tattoo artists.      Because the work is considered cosmetic, though, it typically isn't covered by medical insurance. Still, the mostly unregulated industry continues to grow even as health care professionals debate the safety of tattoo ink. Many people are willing to pay out-of-pocket for that final piece of healing.      Leslie Pollan, 32, a stay-at-home mom and dog breeder in Oxford, Mississippi, feels this service is priceless. She was bitten on the face by a puppy in 2014. She underwent countless surgeries to correct a scar on her lip.      "I went to plastic surgeons that were supposed to be the best in Memphis," Pollan said. "They gave me no hope, so I started looking for other options."      She ultimately traveled six hours for a paramedical tattoo session with Catalano. He used ink and his tattoo needle to camouflage Pollan's lip scar, giving her back a piece of her confidence.      "You don't understand until you've been through it," Pollan said. "It really made me have a different outlook on life."      A Booming Business   More than 500 miles from Catalano's shop, industry expert and paramedical tattoo trainer Feleshia Sams, 41, shows artists and health professionals how to cover stretch marks, surgery scars and discolored skin with flesh-toned pigment in the course she launched at the Academy of Advanced Cosmetics in Alpharetta, Georgia.      While a tattoo license is required for such work, separate paramedical tattoo training is not.      Catalano is self-taught. He uses the techniques he picked up years ago while helping breast cancer survivors who wanted tattoos of areolas -- the dark area around nipples -- after having mastectomies. Those tattoos are among the most common paramedical requests.      His grandmother had breast cancer. Her battle with the disease is one reason Catalano is so dedicated to helping those with the diagnosis.      "Cancer took away a part of my body I can never get back," said Sarah Penberthy, a breast cancer survivor who came from Festus, Missouri, for areola tattoos. "I felt like I wasn't even human."      Penberthy, 39, said she was grateful for her life but still felt incomplete until Catalano stepped in. He tattooed nipples and a creative design of a ship's anchor on her chest that says "I REFUSE TO SINK."      Catalano now does up to eight reconstructive tattoos each "Wellness Wednesday," drawing in nail beds on finger amputees and mocking up belly buttons after tummy tucks.      Catalano doesn't charge for paramedical tattoos. A GoFundMe page established last year brought in more than $12,000, allowing Catalano to donate his skills for the time being.

Per combattere gli effetti negativi del coronavirus sul turismo, arriva l'hashtag #calabriapositivaepropositiva. A lanciarlo l'associazione direttori albergo della Calabria (Ada Calabria). "Parto con questo hashtag - afferma il presidente Ada Calabria, Francesco Gentile - come incipit per far intendere che non bisogna mai piangersi addosso e perdere le speranze, perche' proprio da questo brutto incubo si ci puo' risvegliare e ottenere il dato positivo. L'incoming autoctono e' la chiave di svolta per la ripresa non solo della Calabria ma di tutte le regioni, la riscoperta del viaggio e soggiorno nella nostra Italia dara' sostentamento e ripresa a tutto il comparto turistico Nazionale". Proprio la Calabria, sottolinea Gentile, "sara' la regione che grazie alle sue caratteristiche geografiche, naturalistiche e storiche, accogliera', con il miglior rapporto qualita'-prezzo il flusso di turisti nazionali".E sui comportamenti da tenere all'interno delle strutture per accogliere i turisti provenienti dalle aree interessate al Coronavirus: "Oltre ad applicare le normali procedure dettate dal ministero della Sanita', a mio avviso - dice Gentile - si devono attuare altre procedure atte a mostrare la sicurezza dei nostri prodotti e dei nostri servizi. Come presidente dell' Associazione Direttori Albergo Calabria sto interessando le altre associazioni per istituire un tavolo tecnico in modo da essere di sostegno e supporto a tutto il comparto. Le proposte da noi avanzate sono a carattere risolutivo e mirano non al traslare i tributi e utenze, ma alla loro estinzione fino alla ripresa. Intanto che le istituzioni facciano il loro lungo e burocratico corso, bisogna fare rete e restare uniti per attuare una strategia di Marketing". Infine Gentile ricorda che con una quota del 13,6% sul totale della Ue28, l'Italia e' il terzo Paese in Europa per numero di presenze negli esercizi ricettivi, dopo Spagna e Francia. "Nel breve termine - spiega - chi sta subendo le maggiori perdite economiche sono i soggetti intermediari, il settore dell'outgoing" ma anche l'incoming autoctono, con le stime che "parlano di un vero flop per le festivita' di Pasqua e ponti". Per la stagione estiva, "con l'innalzarsi delle temperature il virus dovrebbe attenuarsi e si spera che rimarra' solo un brutto incubo", conclude il presidente di Ada Calabria.

Twenty-five years ago this month, country music was turned upside down when Canadian singer Shania Twain released her second studio album, "The Woman In Me." It made her one of the most popular stars in the genre and also served as a stepping stone to what would become an impressive international career.      "The Woman In Me" was not a typical album by an up-and-coming artist. Rather, it was a testament of the human spirit. Twain wrote or co-wrote each of the album's 12 tracks with rock producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange. For those who follow music, Lange probably is best-known for his work with Bryan Adams and Def Leppard.      Twain's album went on to produce eight charting singles and sell an impressive 20 million copies.      Twain had a love for rock 'n' roll, while Lange's interest in American country music was growing. The two bonded and Twain's sound began to evolve. Her record company was somewhat caught in the middle, but were pressing her for an album. Despite feeling her new sound was "less country," Polygram/Mercury opted to move forward and let Lange produce the album.      The album's first single, "Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?," fell along the lines of country, while the follow-up single, "Any Man Of Mine," became a massive crossover hit. It quickly topped the Billboard Country Singles chart before crossing over to Top 40.      "Any Man Of Mine" was a major success on both the country and pop radio formats. Twain's star grew by leaps and bounds.      I remember the first time I heard the song and thought, "What?! This is country music?" I liked it.      "The Woman In Me (Needs The Man In You)" followed suit, hitting the country chart. In this case, Twain made her way onto the Adult Contemporary chart, too.      Next, Twain and Lange had recorded two distinct versions of the singles "(If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here!" and "You Win My Love." Each were recorded differently for country audiences and pop-rock audiences. Can we say brilliant?      Remixed songs were nothing new 25 years ago, but if you were a country performer, it was new territory. Twain was about to become globally known.      ″(If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here!" and "You Win My Love" both hit No. 1 on the country chart, but "I'm Outta Here!" lived up to its title. The song became a global smash.      "No One Needs To Know" and "Home Ain't Where His Heart Is (Anymore)" continued her hit streak.      By that point, the world knew Twain. Listeners also were learning a little more about the woman behind the music. Her life was not glamorous before. In fact, it was quite sad. She lost both her parents in a tragic accident and was left to care for her siblings. She put off her dreams of being a singer to do so.      The last single to come from "The Woman In Me" was "God Bless The Child," an a cappella prayer she said to herself after her parents passed away. The heartfelt song was the last track recorded for the album and perhaps the most personal.      "The Woman In Me" was named ACM and Billboard's Country Album Of The Year. It also earned Twain her first Grammy for Best Country Album. And it was the pre- cursor to Twain's massive album, "Come On Over," which made her a superstar.      David T.

The scale of AAA game investment often leads companies to look to protect their investment. In some cases, this can lead to the company losing touch with doing the right thing for their employees. As a developer, signing on the dotted line for a major project can come with restrictions that can get in the way of you being able to practice your craft freely. Non-competes, Non- solicits, and Moonlighting clauses often come up as part of AAA game development. The new job feels like a perfect fit and you're going to see it to the finish line, so no problem, right? Circumstances often change; sometimes the project or maybe the team is not a great fit. I never require such agreements of my employees as I believe developers should work where they want.

Soon enough, being respectful and humble will be second nature, and it will not take any effort at all to make space for other people.

The size of the team can be overwhelming for many developers. Some developers aren't comfortable in that environment. There's a certain scale needed for AAA games, but I try to optimize this through a limit of 120 people on a team so that everyone can know each other. Managing team size allows for better communication and transparency, helping to foster a positive culture. As a team leader, I highly value knowing the people on the team, including their needs at work and in their personal life. The ability to leverage the power of the team and company to help individuals in times of need is greatly increased when the decision-makers in a company know the individuals on the team. Once you lose the ability to know and understand everyone on your team intrapersonal empathy and the ability to work as a team often get lost.

Anche lui è stato minacciato e spinto dall'aggressore, è caduto a terra fratturandosi due costole. A denunciare l'episodio è l'Ordine dei medici di Palermo.

Winfrey: As a young reporter I remember moving to Baltimore and them doing this whole big campaign on “What is an Oprah?” that ended up flopping, because I couldn't live up to what the promos and publicity were. So, by the time I actually ended up … on the air, they were like, “Oh, it's just a black girl with a lot of hair.” And there were people mispronouncing my name and all that stuff. So, I couldn't live up to it. So, I learned from that, as you (Cummins) are now going to learn from this. I learned from that. When I moved to Chicago, I said, “I don't want a billboard, not a word, not a bus stop, not a bumper sticker — I want nothing. I want to go on the air. I want to do whatever I'm going to do. And, by word of mouth, people will hear about it and they will know. I don't want anybody talking about it or talking me up or saying anything." And I've operated from that since, you know?

Financial markets are risk- averse, and the global spread of the coronavirus is boosting the risk factor to new heights, which is why the stock market continued its roller-coaster ride even after Tuesday's Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
