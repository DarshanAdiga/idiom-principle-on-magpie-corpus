AFTER the Munster U21 semi-final win over Clare in 1964, I received another letter from Tipperary County Board, this time inviting me to train with the senior team.
 Before my first training session we had played Waterford in that Munster U21 final where I sustained my broken wrist.
 After just being called up to the Tipp senior panel, it was killing me not being able to join in fully. I couldn’t train as my wrist was in plaster up to my shoulder, but I still went to training and when the boys were gone out hurling, I togged out with my arm in a sling.
 The minute the running part started, I ran out of the tunnel and into the group, and ran away with the lads.
 Paddy Leahy was the head man that time.
 “YOUNG GAYNOR!” he roared.
 “YOUNG GAYNOR... COME BACK HERE!!”
 I let on I didn’t hear him. I was pure eager to be there and be part of it. And Paddy didn’t say a thing to me afterwards.
 The first evening I could train properly in Thurles, there was a very tricky ball that stopped dead in the middle of the field, and I was coming out to the 45 to meet it. And Theo English was coming the other way. I said to myself... This is going to be a fair one!
 Theo English was a very strong, powerful man. I never saw him on the ground, I don’t think anyone ever knocked him down.
 Well, I went headlong into him and neither of us fell, and I got the ball away. I was thinking... This is tough... but I’m still alive.
 I quickly learned how to survive.
 We had great men around us such as John Doyle, Michael Maher, and Kieran Carey in the full-back line; they were powerful men.
 They had a reputation for being rough, tough, and dirty and were given the immortal title of “Hell’s Kitchen” but they weren’t really. They were tough and used their power and their weight to their advantage. Doyle loved a skirmish and pounding into lads, and the Tipperary fans loved him for it.
 We came in one day after playing Cork, and this elderly supporter was in the dressing-room. How he got in I don’t know. But there he was, rubbing down John Doyle. I was looking around wondering where my shirt was, and I saw it was my shirt and vest he was using to rub him down with.
 John Doyle was royalty.
 For us as backs, marking the likes of Jimmy Doyle, Mackey McKenna, Donie Nealon, Larry Kiely, and Liam Devaney, who were all powerful hurlers, was huge. We realised we could only get better by marking them every night in training.
 When you’re watching those lads and seeing the things they could do, it would drive us on as well. I was raw enough going in there as a young fella. I might have been good at home in the club and thinking I had it all, but when I went to Thurles it was another step again.
 The first job was to learn to survive.
 It was pretty daunting starting out with that group of Tipperary seniors, who prior to my arrival were being touted as one of the greatest teams of all time. Not only were they a focused team that put the work in to be as good as they were, they were also a great group of friends who looked after each other and made each new arrival on to the panel feel part of the group right from the start.
 On training nights, Mackey McKenna would do the driving as he started out the furthest north, in Borrisokane. Then we would head up to Newtown for Donie Nealon and back into Nenagh to pick up Mick Burns and then on to Borrisoleigh for Liam Devaney, until he got married and moved into Thurles. That was our load and we used to have right craic.
 Liam King came on the panel later and he’d be coming from Lorrha and he used to bring us then. Mackey was a devil for the greyhounds. Himself and a man called Tom Brereton from Thurles had a greyhound between them and the deal was one of them had him for six months to keep, feed, and train, and then the other would have him for the next six.
 Mackey had his term completed and it was his partner’s turn to take him, but he wouldn’t take him as the dog was no good. We brought the dog over in the car one evening with us to training and tied it to Tom’s door, and we went on to the field.
 The next evening we went into training and when we came out the greyhound was tied to the door of Mackey’s car, and we had to bring him home again. He must have been a real dud of a greyhound.
 When Liam Devaney was living at home in Borrisoleigh with his parents, they reared sows and they used to sell them for a fiver apiece. One evening, we called to Devaney’s house and there was no sign of him. We were after blowing the horn for a good few minutes.
 Eventually he came out. “What the hell kept you?” Donie Nealon asked.
 “The sow was having banbhs,” he said.
 “You and your banbhs... we have an All-Ireland to win!”
 “All-Ireland me eye,” said Devaney, “... and every fart a fiver”.

Biden's lead grew by nearly two points in Pennsylvania, where the former vice president now leads by 6.5%. Biden has "flipped" the state of Georgia slightly into his favor within the past week, where Trump's 1.3% lead in the RCP average has turned into a 0.3% edge for the former vice president.
 Biden's lead has remained relatively flat in Ohio, where he is up 2.5%, as well as Michigan (+5.5%), North Carolina (+0.5%), Arizona (+0.3%), and Minnesota (9.4%).
 The only good news for Trump is in the state of Wisconsin, where he narrowed Biden's lead by 1.5 points to 5.5 percent.
 It is important to note that Biden's lead in five of these states is less than five percent. So, a path to victory certainly exists for Trump especially given wildcard factors such as the potential for chaos due to a massive influx of mail-in ballots amid the pandemic. Not to mention, the risk of undercounting Trump voters who are less likely to participate in polls, which happened in 2016 in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
 If the election were held today, the Democrats would end up with a 51 to 49 majority in the Senate, where the Republicans currently control 53 seats, the same scenario as last week. Eight of the 35 Senate races up for grabs on the November 3 ballot are in the "toss-up" category, seven of which involve Republican incumbents.
 In South Carolina, Senator Lindsey Graham is now tied after leading by a point last week, according to the RCP. In Arizona, Democratic challenger Mark Kelly has grown his lead over Republican incumbent Martha McSally by nearly a point to 6 percent. North Carolina's Thom Tillis has seen his deficit grow by two points, with challenger Cal Cunningham now ahead by 8%.
 Republican Join Ernst in Iowa saw her deficit nearly double to 5% since last week, while Oregon Senator Susan Collins remains 6.5 points behind. Two other Republican senators have maintained tight leads including Georgia's David Perdue (+2.8%) and Montana's Steve Daines (1.6%). Michigan incumbent Democrat Gary Peters saw his lead narrow by one point to 3.8%.
 Meanwhile, the Democrats appear to be in a good position to maintain control of the 435-member House of Representatives, where they have a 36-seat edge. All 435 seats will be on the November 3 ballot.
 The Democrats have a solid lead in 214 races to 190 for the Republicans with 31 in the toss-up category, according to RCP, the same tally as last week. The Democrats need to win at least 218 seats to maintain majority control. If the election were held today they would secure 233 seats, according to the RCP's "no toss-up" map.

Mr Biden was at home in Wilmington, Delaware, on Sunday with no plans for in- person campaigning or other public appearances.
 Having already tested negative, he is expected to release the results of a new coronavirus test later, and the campaign has pledged to disclose those results and all other future test results for the 77-year-old candidate.
 On Saturday, chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters outside the hospital, “We’re still not on a clear path yet to a full recovery”. In an update on Saturday night, Mr Trump’s chief doctor expressed cautious optimism but added that the president was “not yet out of the woods”.
 Meanwhile, Mr Trump’s handling of the pandemic and his own health faced new scrutiny.
 His medical care is far superior to the average American’s, with around-the- clock attention and experimental treatments. In the hospital video, he defended his decision to continue campaigning and holding large events during a pandemic.
 “I had no choice,” said Mr Trump, who refused to abide by basic public health recommendations, including mask-wearing. “I had to be out front… I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe… As a leader, you have to confront problems.”
 Mr Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than seven million people nationwide and killed more than 209,000 people in the US.
 First lady Melania Trump remained at the White House to recover from her own bout with the virus.

“There are 42 households on Browns Gap Turnpike between the lake and Jones Mill Rd.,” he said—which connects to Rt. 810 just ½ mile south of White Hall. “Plus many people from White Hall, Brown’s Cove, and points north use this road to get to 250 when they go to work. But I am most concerned about access by fire and rescue trucks. It is 3.1 miles from Cow Path Lane to the Crozet firehouse, but 7.1 miles by White Hall Rd. This road closure would add at least 15 minutes to that trip. There was a three-alarm fire at Brooking’s house this May. Fortunately, the fire trucks got there within ten minutes and were able to save the house. If they had had to go all the way through White Hall, the house would have been a total loss. If someone has a stroke or a heart attack, it would take the ambulance double the time than it does now to get here. It’s a matter of health and safety.”

Johaan van Graan hailed Munster’s fighting spirit after his team made the impossible happen against the Scarlets, reports Alex Bywater, from Parc y Scarlets.
 The odds looked stacked against the Irish raiders when they fell 24-10 behind in the second half and also lost captain Peter O’Mahony who was sent off for receiving two yellow cards.
 With 10 minutes remaining hope of a Munster comeback was slim, but they found a way to win as they scored 13 points with a man short.
 A late try from replacement hooker Kevin O’Byrne was followed by a last-gasp penalty from halfway from Ben Healy.
 Healy’s late kick was the first time Munster had been ahead in the game.
 “With Munster nothing is impossible,” said a delighted Van Graan who saw Jack O’Donoghue, Chris Farrell and O’Byrne touch down. “That’s what our club is built on. I knew all about Munster’s tradition and never-say-die attitude when I was back home in South Africa.
 “It’s about community, respect, values, and never giving up. Whether we are playing home or away we always try and find a way. I never thought the result was beyond us. Munster always stand up and fight and that’s what we did. We never panicked when Peter got sent off. Obviously if you lose your captain for the last 10 minutes you could lose your head, but the coaching staff and the players kept their cool. We took it play by play and ground out the win.”
 In front of the watching British & Irish Lions head coach Warren Gatland, O’Mahony did himself no favours as he was sent off for accumulating two yellow cards. Both came for needlessly charging into rucks.
 All of the Scarlets’ points came via the boot of Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny who looked like he would kick Munster into submission. His nine penalty goals was a Scarlets record in one game and equalled the PRO14 best of Luciano Orquera for Aironi against Benetton in December 2011.
 Halfpenny booted his team into a comfortable lead while O’Mahony saw yellow for the first time. But Munster responded with a fine move involving Andrew Conway and Damian de Allende with the end result seeing flanker O'Donoghue going over. JJ Hanrahan converted.
 Halfpenny’s fourth penalty and a miss from Hanrahan left Munster 12-7 down at the break. Munster were second best, especially up front, and Halfpenny continued to be pinpoint from the tee. Farrell burrowed over the Scarlets line to give Munster hope, but television match official Ben Whitehouse showed Scottish referee Sam Grove-White numerous replays.
 O'Mahony was pictured using the shoulder at a ruck after Farrell had scored and he was promptly sent off although the try and Healy's conversion stood.
 Surely Munster were dead and buried despite the seven points? Not so.
 Halfpenny and Healy swapped kicks before O’Byrne and a Healy conversion tied the game.
 There was still time for late drama. From 50 metres, Healy stepped up to win it.
 “He made one or two errors, but Ben is somebody that wants the ball and he certainly wanted that ball in the last minute,” said Van Graan, when asked about the monstrous match-winning kick. “That’s what you dream of as a young 10 – kicking the winning penalty in a game like this. He’s got a long boot on him. A lot of time in this competition it comes down to small margins and from last year’s competition we ended level on points with Edinburgh so this might be a big result in the wider context of the PRO14.”
