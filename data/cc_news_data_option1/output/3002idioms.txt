"Because I usually have to go all the way around or come here and go all the way around and it's hot, it's hot outside so I just want to get where I'm going fast," explained Wilkes-Barre resident Brandon Koelling. "So now I can get right there to the store if I need to and I can go right down to the plasma center if I need to, and I can get to my appointment that way instead of having to go all the way around."

On Friday, Jefferson City Schools -- about an hour northeast of Atlanta -- will be the first district in Georgia to "reopen schools for face-to-face instruction."


  "They're going to open the floodgates wide open," Amber Davies said.


  "And there's no way to (contact) trace. Once kids go from one class to the next class, to the next class, they cannot do the tracing."


  Across the US, countless parents are riddled with anxiety -- for different reasons.


  In school districts where classrooms are reopening, children, teachers and staff run the risk of infection.


  In districts where students will learn remotely from home, parents worry about how they'll be able go to work or afford childcare.


  For the Davies, both their 14-year-old and 8-year-old sons won't be able to go to school Friday due to the older son's infection.


  "They're going to have a late start, but they are going to go back once we're cleared medically," Amber Davies said.


  But both parents are worried about what will happen when their sons go back to school.


  Amber Davies suffers from lupus disease and is at high risk for severe complications from Covid-19. She's been trying to quarantine in a different room after her older son's infection, but her husband is worried about the younger son getting infected at school.


  "My biggest concern is he catches something and then brings it back to my wife," Zack Davies said.


  "I feel our children are going to be fine. They'll bounce back. But somebody with lupus -- it's a tougher fight for her. A common cold for me and you, we're down maybe two days. Something like that for her, we're looking at weeks. And it's scary."

SEATTLE (AP) — The Seattle Kraken added to their hockey operations staff by hiring Dave Baseggio as director of pro scouting Thursday. Baseggio spent the past 12 seasons with Anaheim as a pro scout, director of pro scouting and assistant to the general manager for the Ducks. Baseggio also played and coached in the AHL. “To help start a franchise from scratch is a unique opportunity,” Baseggio said in a statement. Kraken general manager Ron Francis also announced the hiring of three additional pro scouts to join the original five the team hired last year. Seattle added Andrew Allen as its goalies scout after he spent the past four seasons as the goalie coach for the Buffalo Sabres. Seattle also hired Lorne Henning and William White to join Cammi Granato, Ulf Samuelsson, Stu Barnes, Dave Hunter and John Goodwin on the pro scouting staff for the Kraken.

NORTHBOROUGH -- Former Westborough High standout Jack Choate has been dealing - and raking.


  The Assumption College freshman - who had his first collegiate season cut short this spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic - is exclusively a pitcher for the Greyhounds where he appeared in four games and posted an 0-1 record with a 4.05 ERA and earned one save in 6.2 innings of work in the shortened season.


  "I'm a better pitcher than hitter," said Choate following Northborough's 4-2 win over Leominster in its regular season finale of Worcester County Baseball League play.


  However, based on how he has been smashing the ball this summer, you wouldn't know it.


  In his last five games including Wednesday night, Choate has been hitting 10-for-15 from the plate with two home runs, four doubles and nine RBI. Overall this season he's hitting .400 with nine doubles, two homers and 20 runs batted in.


  On Wednesday, he was 2-for-3 with a double, one run scored and one RBI as he helped lead Northborough to its fifth straight win as they head into the playoffs with a 10-7 record (7-6 WCBL) and a first round bye.


  "We had a slow start to the season for sure," Choate said. "But we have been able to rally the last couple days and win five straight taking it to the playoffs."


  On the mound, Choate has been dominating hitters to the tune of allowing just four hits, recording 42 strikeouts and posting a 1.05 ERA in 20 innings pitched.


  "Just got to be aggressive," Choate said. "When I'm on the mound, I just want to work quick, pound the zone and try to get the guys back in the dugout as quickly as possible.


  "When I'm at the plate, I don't want to mess around and get into any 3-2 counts or things like that. I just want to see a fastball early in the count."


  In his last outing against Milford, Choate pitched five no-hit innings striking out 10 but allowed six walks.


  "The pitch-count was getting up there with the walks," Northborough manager Ken McDonald said. "We didn't want to overuse him."


  For awhile, Choate wasn't even sure he was going to be able to play at all this summer after his collegiate season was cut short.


  "For awhile we weren't sure we were going to have a season," Choate said. "To be around the guys all the time and playing baseball every day, its a great feeling."


  When Choate isn't on the mound, Northborough has a steady stable of reliable arms including that of recent Algonquin graduate Jack Connor.


  On Wednesday, Connor pitched a complete game, giving up two runs (one earned) on six hits, recording three strikeouts and allowed one walk.


  "I thought Jack (Connor) did a great job," McDonald said. "He did a really good job of saving our bullpen, our bullpen has been really stressed out lately with a lot of games and innings and we've had some injuries, so he did a great job."


  Connor got out of a couple of jams thanks to two timely double plays.


  "Pat Solomon, huge shoutout to him, he gave it his all today at short," Connor said. "I had great D behind me and I certainly wouldn't have gotten out of those jams without them."


  In the fourth inning, Leominster loaded the bases with one out after a single to left by third baseman Sean Dutton.


  Connor would get out of the inning when he induced Nick Ouellette to hit into a 4-6-3 double play.


  The second jam came in the seventh inning after Dutton hit a RBI single driving in Danny Garcia to cut the Northborough lead to 4-2. Ouellette stepped up to the plate representing the go-ahead run but once again Connor got him to ground into a 6-3 double play to end the ballgame.


  "I just had to trust my stuff and trust my team behind me and just give it my all on the mound and it all played out," Connor said. "I had a good mix of two seams and cutters to get those on the ground."


  Northborough got the scoring started by sending nine men to the plate in the first. Solomon led off the ballgame with a triple and was driven in by a single by Drew Lewis-Keddy. An RBI single by Westborough junior Nick Choate made it 2-0 and a Nick Poon sacrifice fly brought in Jack Choate to give Northborough a 3-0 lead after one inning of play.


  Jack Choate would drive in the fourth Northborough run in the second inning on an RBI double that brought in Lewis-Keddy made it 4-0.

Kris Massman, Mike’s wife, said they’ve also made some close friends in the club, firing off in a group text message every time another bird makes it home.


  “It’s kinda strange to me that people don’t understand how pigeons work,” Kris Massman said.


  “How their ears work and how they can find their way back home from states away,” Kendra said, finishing her mother’s thought.


  Kris said the hardest parts of owning and racing pigeons are training the birds and keeping them healthy. One family's pigeon loft can be kept sanitary, but their birds are frequently flying with other birds that could be carrying diseases. Others have had problems with predators, including hawks, owls and hunters.


  Kendra said they’ll sometimes get a call from their neighbors who tell them there’s a pigeon at their house that won’t leave.


  “Get it some water, and maybe it’ll take off and finish its way home,” Kris said.


  After letting the pigeons out for an afternoon flight, Mike said they’d be back to the loft within an hour, cooped up and ready to clock in for their next race.
