When North Queensland charged into the grand final from eighth spot in 2017, it was on the back of otherworldly performances from Jason Taumalolo and Michael Morgan. Almost four years later, Taumalolo has continued to bend reality to his will while Morgan has struggled with injuries and ill-form ever since and the Cowboys are yet to return to the finals. In Taumalolo, North Queensland have one of the best forwards of all time but all the metres in the world can't make up for a lack of creativity. Whether it comes from a move to five-eighth, a new halves partner or just a fresh approach, getting Morgan back to his best should be new coach Todd Payten's top priority.

The group, which is largely boutique studios that offer personal training or small group classes, said the city failed to provide data to back up why it closed some businesses and not others, and that closure without financial support will result in permanent business failure.


  “Just here in Philadelphia alone, we’ve had over 13 studios who shut down. And frankly, a lot of people say, ‘This is only six weeks,’ but if we look at what’s been happening, it’s been eight months,” said Jaime Sutton, owner of J’aime Fitness in Fairmount.


  Coalition members also criticized the new regulations as baseless, that they have been imposed “without showing valid transmission data,” said McKay. The coalition compiled its own data from member gyms, which they say shows zero transmissions within their spaces out of 318,000 visits.


  They also distanced themselves from photos showing maskless exercisers, including City Councilmember Bobby Henon, which have circulated online in recent weeks. This group said it can’t speak for all gyms, but that they represent businesses taking the regulations seriously.


  “Right now, it’s a blanket shutdown, which isn’t equitable,” said Osayi Osunde, the owner and co-founder of Fit Academy in Brewerytown.


  When announcing the new guidelines, Philadelphia Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the closures were based on “the best data available to us.”


  Some of that information came via conversations with contact tracers, as well as studies from other cities and countries, which show the coronavirus spreads in indoor settings where people are not wearing masks. However, “there’s room for judgment in all of this,” continued Farley.


  A study published earlier this month in the journal Nature found that indoor activity at restaurants, gyms, cafes, hotels and religious centers had unsafe rates of transmission during the spring wave. It argued that reducing occupancy thresholds at these places can keep cases down without resorting to full-scale lockdowns.


  Philadelphia imposed new restrictions as COVID-19 cases surged around the region and country. There are currently more than 3,000 people hospitalized for coronavirus in Pennsylvania, higher than at any point during the prior peak in the spring. Gov. Tom Wolf announced new measures to enforce existing mitigation efforts on Monday, including firmer enforcement of mask wearing, but stopped short of closing down businesses again. Without increased federal aid for businesses, he said, coronavirus protections must be balanced against the state’s “very fragile economy.”


  Several gym owners said they have met with Philadelphia city councilmembers to air their concerns, and they are also communicating with the offices of U.S. Sens. Pat Toomey and Bob Casey.


  The group has circulated a list of demands where their petition has more than 3,000 signatures. They want fitness centers to be named “essential” businesses and new city- and state-funded business grants, among other asks.


  There had been $1.3 billion dollars in unspent federal coronavirus relief aid tied up in Harrisburg for months. Many Democrats had been advocating for those funds to be used to help struggling businesses. Republican leaders and the governor opted instead to use the money to prop up the state budget, using funds to cover expenses related to first responders. Wolf signed that deal Monday.


  The group supports a national bailout for gyms through the National Health and Fitness Recovery Act.


  Some of the fitness studios received PPP loans from the federal government earlier in the pandemic, but with no agreement from Congress and the White House since April, new money has not flowed to individuals or businesses in need. Even when allowed to open, gyms have only been bringing in 30-50% of pre-COVID revenues, far short of levels the coalition says it needs to break even in many cases.


  On social media, many onlookers mocked the workout/protest as proving that gyms could in fact run classes safely outside.

Incoming lawmakers after Kuwait's Dec. 5 election will decide the public debt bill's fate, and it won't be an easy sell.
 "The whole system is corrupt," said Omar al-Tabtabaee, an independent lawmaker running for reelection. "There's corruption in our projects, in how they choose civil servants. No Kuwaiti is happy about our situation."
 Earlier this year, al-Tabtabaee rejected a plan to raise Kuwait's debt ceiling, along with a majority of lawmakers who feared the fresh revenue would line the pockets of wealthy merchants and foreign banks.
 "People have lost their trust in the government," said Mohammed al-Yousef, an independent Kuwaiti political analyst. "There have been so many scandals and not one minister is in prison."
 The scandals include a scheme that looted billions of dollars from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, ensnaring a member of Kuwait's ruling family. Another smuggled Bangladeshi laborers into the country with the alleged help of lawmakers. Last year, the Cabinet resigned over accusations that hundreds of millions of dollars were missing from a military fund.
 Now ministers are struggling to convince an increasingly resentful public. The former finance minister, Mariam al-Aqeel, left her post in February after coming under fire for suggesting the government close its deficit by taxing citizens and cutting salaries. Six Finance Ministry officials resigned last month in what was seen as a bid to drive out the current minister, who has pushed hard for the debt law.
 The resistance stems from Kuwait's decades-old social contract. Scaling back the bloated welfare state alters a system in which cradle-to-grave benefits buy loyalty — a recipe for unrest without concessions from the top.
 "Kuwaitis think, why would I contribute my own money if the government isn't holding anyone accountable? If I can't see where their money is going?" said Barrak Algharabally, an expert in government budgeting at Kuwait University.
 As Kuwait quarrels, available cash is dwindling. For the first time in history, oil revenues won't cover salaries and subsidies, which have swelled since 2006 and now eat up more than 70% of the national budget. At current oil prices and spending levels, the general reserve fund will dry up by December, said Raghu Mandagolathur, research director at the Kuwait Financial Center, an investment bank.
 Even when the virus recedes, oil prices aren't expected to soar to 2014 peaks of over $100 a barrel. Experts say the pandemic has given Kuwait a glimpse of the future, jolting the country out of the assumption it can live beyond its means forever. But whether the shock will force much-needed reforms remains to be seen.
 "We'll have fun for the next 10, 20 years, but what's next?" asked Algharabally, the budgeting expert. "What will happen to our sons and grandsons?"

El Paso County, which has more than 839,000 residents, on Tuesday reported 36,640 active COVID-19 cases, more than any other county in the state.
 Last week, the Texas National Guard sent a 36-member team to El Paso to assist morgues with the number of dead due to COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Jail inmates are being paid to move bodies and county leaders have offered $27 an hour for morgue workers.
 Samaniego said El Paso County is currently operating 13 mobile morgues and they are holding the bodies of 236 individuals.
 El Paso County is not an outlier in Texas as the number of new coronavirus cases and deaths have spiked in recent weeks across the state.
 Texas recorded 13,998 coronavirus cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 1,401 the previous one-day high set on Saturday.
 The Texas Department of State Health Services on Tuesday also announced 162 new deaths and 8,495 virus hospitalizations.
 The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Texas has risen from 7,680 new cases per day on Nov. 9 to 10,441 on Monday, based on data from Johns Hopkins University.
 The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths increased from 96 to 144 per day during the same time period. Texas' 21,049 COVID-19 related deaths to date are the second highest in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins.
 Dolores Espinoza, 38, a patient care assistant at Las Palmas Medical Center in El Paso told The Associated Press last week that a man in his 40s being treated at her hospital for COVID-19 had to celebrate his birthday alone. His wife had recently died from the virus.
 Espinoza said the cafeteria sent the man a cake and the nurses wished him a happy birthday as he cried and told them, "This is the saddest day because I have nobody."
 Espinoza said there is little to no space left in her hospital, most rooms already have two beds and every floor but hers is devoted to COVID-19 patient care.
 Earlier Tuesday, Abbott announced the state has established a wing at an alternate care site set up in El Paso's convention center to administer a new antibody drug similar to a treatment President Donald Trump received after contracting the virus last month.
 The drug, called bamlanivimab, may help clear the coronavirus sooner and possibly cut hospitalizations in people with mild to moderate COVID-19.
 The infusion wing, which began accepting patients Tuesday, has been provided with 1,000 doses of the drug.
 "The establishment of the bamlanivimab infusion wing ... is crucial to keeping hospitalizations down and protecting at-risk Texans in the community," Abbott said.
 State health officials have said only an extremely limited supply of the drug is coming to Texas.
 KVUE-TV reported Tuesday that Williamson County Judge Bill Gravell planned to plead guilty and pay a $1,000 fine for violating his own emergency coronavirus order when he attended his grandchild's birthday party in the spring. In a statement, Gravell apologized for a "lapse in judgment." The county is located north of Austin.

Maloney was nearing the end of his career and Moylan, at 26, was entering his prime years with a fresh start after things soured for him at Penrith. Fast forward three years and Moylan is at a major crossroads. The 29-year old has played just 43 games in three years due to a number of injuries and there seems to be no consensus on whether fullback or five-eighth is his best spot in the future or even if he's still in the club's best 17. Given his healthy salary, the Sharks need to find a way to get more out of Moylan or accept it's time for both parties to move on.

It seemed to me Chappelle was a bit of the turd in the punchbowl, the kind of Debbie Downer reality check to what the whites & possibly many blacks are feeling. A bit of the "blacks keep whites honest - & stop them from dancing bad" is a bit pretentious, a bit retread dumb. But still, I appreciated that somehow as food for thought - I'm worn out after Trump, and Covid's still raging, so I'm not quite in the dancing on cars mood. That doesn't mean I wholeheartedly agree with Chappelle either - though I do also think some of these things like "Kung Flu" are overblown - the whole "you have to be an X to say something about X" seems sad, so limited. I mean, I'm happy if a non-leper gives me a new leprosy joke, or someone who doesn't suffer from an intestinal disorder gives me some new material for dyspepsia.

Alderson said he had interviewed six GM candidates and will decide whether second and third interviews are needed before presenting one or two candidates to Cohen. He hopes the new GM could grow into a president of baseball operations role.
 John Ricco, who shifted from assistant general manager to a senior vice president when Van Wagenen was hired, will be Alderson's "right-hand person" interfacing for Alderson with both the baseball and business departments. He is not a GM candidate.
 Alderson was the Mets' general manager from October 2010 until he left in July 2018 following a recurrence of cancer that no longer is a problem.
 He said the team had much work ahead after a fourth-place finish at 26-34.
 "I don't think we're a player away," he said. "I think we need more than that. Do we have a good foundation? Yes, I think we have an excellent foundation. But I think that our needs are multiple at this point."
 On other topics:
 — Robinson Canó. The second baseman's 162-game suspension for performance- enhancing drugs relieves the Mets of $24 million in salary next season. Cohen tweeted he would like to "spend it on players" but Alderson said "there's an additional amount of money to be spent in 2021, which is already earmarked for '22 and '23, so it's not quite as easy as just an add-on. On the other hand, it does provide us some additional flexibility" financially and in roster space. As for deciding whether to release Canó after the suspension, Alderson said "it's something that will entertain further down the road."
 — Michael Conforto. The outfielder turns 28 in March and is eligible for free agency after next season. "At some point, I'm sure we will broach that topic and take their temperature and see where things stand, but right now those conversations have not taken place."
 — Tim Tebow. Alderson said the 33-year-old minor league outfielder, a former Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, is wanted back for 2021. "This is not a quest without end. At some point it will culminate, but I think that will be at a time when Tim and the organization come to some agreement about where he is, what his potential is. But I didn't want him to go out based on some COVID-related interruption."
 — Designated hitter. Alderson hopes it is extended to the National League for 2021 after its first use throughout MLB. "The time has come that both leagues play with the same resources, the same options," he said. "Pitchers can't even bunt anymore. So I'm in favor of putting a hitter in that additional slot." He said the Mets have internal options and will not seek to add a DH.

Comedians are apologizing because their target audience is essentially booing and walking out. The apology is their attempt to stop that.

They're doing fine with their target audience and only get in trouble when they try to expand beyond it. They don't have to apologize. They can say fuck em if they can't take a joke.

So, I think they're, you know the NHL owners have talked about what they may need to have to adjust. We've heard what the players have had to say. Here's what I have got to say. We saw great collaboration with the players and the NHL in the Return to Play. I think it's going to take real significant collaboration to understand that it's nobody's fault here and that maybe what's being asked for is not out of the question but that gives the players an opportunity to ask perhaps for some things that are important to them.

Powering Up Wyoming purports to have 5,000 supporters across the state.
 “As our state grapples with funding for the everyday services that we all rely on, renewable energy development is well poised to play an increasingly important role in maintaining our status as an energy leader,” Chris Brown, Powering Up Wyoming’s executive director, said in a statement. “Our board brings a diverse set of backgrounds and industries together to inform Wyoming residents about the opportunities that wind, solar, and storage already provide our communities and will continue to well into the future.”
 But the group’s lobbyist is up against a lot.
 Over the years, Wyoming’s Legislature and state agencies have vacillated over whether to offer a full endorsement of renewable energy development in a state traditionally dependent on coal, oil and gas.
 Some of the public has yet to come on board too, as seen by recent opposition to the Rail Tie wind energy project proposed in Albany County.
 But new board member Phil Christopherson said it’s time for the state’s leaders and public to look at all options.
 Christopherson is the chief operation officer of Energy Capital Economic Development in Gillette.
 “I feel it is important to explore energy generation, distribution, and storage systems that can enable the nation and the world,” he said.
 Doing so will mean Wyoming can meet global energy demand in a way that Christopherson believes “benefits the economy, while being good stewards of the environment.”

“If you’re fighting a battle and the cavalry is on the way, you don’t stop shooting; you keep going until the cavalry gets here, and then you might even want to continue fighting,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious- disease expert, said last week.
 This week, AstraZeneca became the third vaccine maker to say early data indicates its shots are highly effective. Pfizer last week asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization to begin distributing its vaccine, and Moderna is expected to do the same any day. Federal officials say the first doses will ship within a day of authorization.
 But most people will probably have to wait months for shots to become widely available. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines also each require two doses, meaning people will have to go back for a second shot after three and four weeks, respectively, to get the full protection.
 Moncef Slaoui, head of the U.S. vaccine development effort, said on CNN on Sunday that early data on the Pfizer and Moderna shots suggest about 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity — a milestone he said is likely to happen in May.
 But along the way, experts say the logistical challenges of the biggest vaccination campaign in U.S. history and public fear and misinformation could hinder the effort and kick the end of the pandemic further down the road.
 “It’s going to be a slow process and it’s going to be a process with ups and downs, like we’ve seen already,” said Dr. Bill Moss, an infectious-disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.
 SHOTS IN ARMS
 Once federal officials give a vaccine the go-ahead, doses that are already being stockpiled will be deployed with the goal of “putting needles in people’s arms” within 24 to 48 hours, said Paul Mango, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official involved in the Operation Warp Speed effort to develop COVID-19 vaccines.
 Those first shipments are expected to be limited and will be directed to high- risk groups at designated locations, such as front-line health care workers at hospitals.
 Federal and state officials are still figuring out exactly how to prioritize those most at risk, including the elderly, prison inmates and homeless people. By the end of January, HHS officials say, all senior citizens should be able to get shots, assuming a vaccine becomes available by the end of 2020.
 For everyone else, they expect widespread availability of vaccines would start a couple of months later.
 To make shots easily accessible, state and federal officials are enlisting a vast network of providers, such as pharmacies and doctor’s offices.
 But some worry long lines won’t be the problem.
 “One of the things that may be a factor that hasn’t been discussed that much is: ‘How many will be willing to be vaccinated?’” said Christine Finley, director of Vermont’s immunization program. She noted the accelerated development of the vaccine and the politics around it have fueled worries about safety.

Though Bishop showed his teammates what he was capable of, he couldn’t show anyone else. He’d work out, lift weights and practice just like everyone else. Then he’d have to wear a polo shirt and khaki pants and sit on the end of Montana State’s bench during games.
 Bishop recognized the benefits. He could add strength, learn Sprinkle’s schemes and acclimate to a new school. But he was also frustrated he couldn’t play.
 He missed out on games like against rival Montana with raucous crowds and thrilling last-second wins like against South Dakota State. It was the big moments with the game on the line that he yearned for the most.
 “X is just a gamer,” Kirby said.
 When Sprinkle recruited Bishop, the coach knew he needed to fill the point guard void Frey left behind. Sprinkle believes replacing Frey will take a team effort, and Bishop provides a different skillset.
 But the intention has always been clear. Bishop was brought to Bozeman in order to make a difference.
 “He’s electric. The fans will love him,” Sprinkle predicted 18 months ago.
 Now comes Bishop’s chance to prove his coach right.

RENO, Nev. (AP) — Nevada defensive tackle Dom Peterson and punter Julian Diaz have been named two of the Mountain West Conference’s three players of the week after the Wolf Pack extended their undefeated record to 5-0 with a 26-21 victory over San Diego State.
 Peterson had four tackles, including three for losses and two sacks to claim defensive player of the week. The junior from Harbor City, California helped Nevada’s defense shut out the Aztecs in the second half Saturday and held them to just 109 rushing yards on the game — 170 below their season average.
