Best known for his 1990s role as the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton, Starr became a household name with his report on Clinton's extramarital relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. That led to Clinton's impeachment over 20 years ago. A former U.S. solicitor general and federal circuit court judge, Starr has been a regular guest on Fox News, defending Trump on his favored network. But he and Trump haven't always been on the same page. "I think that Ken Starr is a lunatic. I really think that Ken Starr is a disaster," Trump said in an interview with NBC's "Today" in 1999. Starr was removed as president of Baylor University and then resigned as chancellor of the school in the wake of a review critical of the university's handling of sexual assault allegations against football players. Starr was also involved in the representation of Epstein.

Legal experts opine that the CII recommendations are not binding on the government and parliament to implement. The CII Chairman Dr Qibla Ayaz concurs with this view and says the CII only “advises” the government, parliament and provincial assemblies and it is for them to enforce its findings. The CII declared three clauses of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) un- Islamic. Section 14 pertains to burden of proof and presumption against accused accepting illegal gratification, Section 15 relates to disqualification to contest elections and hold public office and Section 26 covers tender of pardon (approver).
 The accountability courts convicted Nawaz Sharif in both the London apartments and Al-Azizia Steels Mills cases on the basis of presumption after concluding that he has failed to come clean on the allegations for having the burden of proof on his shoulders to establish that he is innocent. The 131-page verdict of the trial court in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills reference contained the word “presume” 10 times and the word “presumption” for 13 times. Judge Arshad Malik defended the use of presumption while quoting the law of evidence and previous judgments of the superior courts and even used illustrations to show instances where the court could presume.
 He held that the prosecution has successfully established all the ingredients of the offence of corruption and corrupt practices against the former prime minister. He ruled that as per the evidence read before him and documents referred, the prosecution has succeeded in establishing a reasonable case against the accused, who faced the burden of proof.
 The court used the illustrations mentioned in the law of evidence which stated that a man, who is in possession of stolen goods soon after the theft, is either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen unless he can account for his possession. In the London apartments’ case, Judge Muhammad Bashir had also relied on presumption and sentenced Nawaz Sharif accordingly. On presumption-based evidence, the court first established that the ex-premier was the owner of the London properties and then punished him for failing to explain the sources with which he had purchased them.
 However, the judge acquitted Nawaz Sharif and others from the charge of having acquired these properties “by corrupt, dishonest, or illegal means”. The accused was convicted for his failure to explain how he had purchased the London flats. However, while doing so, the judge instead of relying on concrete evidence, depended on presumptive or circumstantial evidence to conclude that Nawaz Sharif is the real owner of the London flats.
 The judge admitted in his verdict that establishing the ownership of the flats was difficult in the absence of relevant documents but made it clear that it is relying on prosecution’s presumption that the accused is the owner of the properties.
 However, Nawaz Sharif’s convictions in both the references also became questionable because of a ruling of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in one case and owing to the video scandal of Judge Arshad Malik in the other.
 In the London apartments case, a two-member IHC bench, while granting bail to Nawaz Sharif, Maryam and Captain (retd) Safdar, had found that the conviction and sentences handed down to them “may not be ultimately sustainable”.
 The verdict said that the NAB was unable to prove the corruption charges and pointed out that though the prosecution had told the accountability court that Maryam was her father's dependent, its judgment did not refer to any evidence which would connect her to have aided, assisted or conspired with her father at the time when the apartments were said to have been acquired between 1993 and 1996.

The sanctions, announced at the White House, marked the latest salvo in a US- Iranian confrontation that risked sliding into war a week ago with the deadly US drone attack on general Qasem Soleimani, who was by some measures the second most influential person in Iran.
 In response, Iran fired volleys of ballistic missiles at Iraqi bases housing US troops, without causing casualties. While President Donald Trump said he would not respond further militarily, Washington is intent on maintaining pressure.
 The sanctions mean “we will cut off billions of dollars of support to the Iranian regime,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the White House.
 The measures targeting Iran’s steel industry and eight state officials came on top of massive sanctions already aimed at bringing the country’s economy to its knees.
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that sanctions so far “have deprived the regime of billions in revenue.”
 “Oil revenues (are) down by 80 percent and Iran cannot access roughly 90 percent of its foreign policy reserves,” he said. “As long as Iran’s outlaw ways continue we will continue to impose sanctions.”
 Among the senior Iranian officials targeted in the new measures were Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Mohammad Reza Ashtiani, the Iranian armed forces deputy chief of staff and Gholamreza Soleimani, the head of the Basij militia, a volunteer force loyal to the regime.
 Seventeen Iranian metals producers and mining companies were listed. The sanctions also included a network of three entities that are based in China and the Seychelles as well as a vessel “involved in the purchase, sale, and transfer of Iranian metals products,” the Treasury said in a statement.
 Critics are questioning why Trump — who has been impeached and faces a Senate trial in the coming days — ordered Soleimani’s killing last week. US media reported Friday that the American military allegedly targeted an additional Iranian official, Abdul Reza Shahlai, who is a senior officer of Iran’s elite Quds Force, in a top-secret mission on the same day in Yemen.
 Shahlai was not killed, but the reports beg further questions about whether Trump was indeed acting to prevent an additional attack by Soleimani or carrying out a broader campaign against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
 The administration has pushed back against accusations that Trump acted recklessly, insisting long-time US foe Soleimani was on the brink of launching an attack and had to be stopped. On Thursday, Trump said that Soleimani had been planning to blow up the US embassy in Baghdad. However, officials did not back up that scenario.
 Then on Friday, Trump shifted, saying “probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad.”
 “I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies,” Trump added in an interview.
 Earlier, Pompeo said the US had specific information on “imminent” attacks “against American facilities, including American embassies, military bases.”
 But he added he did not know what day they were planned for. The United States has been at loggerheads with Iran for decades. Soon after Trump came into office he withdrew from an international accord meant to give Iran the ability to develop civilian nuclear power while under supervision. Trump claimed that Tehran was cheating and trying to obtain a nuclear weapon. At a re-election campaign rally in Ohio on Thursday, Trump referred to Soleimani as “the world’s top terrorist.” “He was a bloodthirsty terror and he’s no longer a terror. He’s dead.”

TEHRAN: Iran said Saturday it "unintentionally" shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people aboard, in an abrupt about-turn after initially denying Western claims it was struck by a missile.
 President Hassan Rouhani said a military probe into the tragedy had found "missiles fired due to human error" brought down the Boeing 737, calling it an "unforgivable mistake". He said Iran had been on alert for possible US attacks after Soleimani's "martyrdom".
 "Iran is very much saddened by this catastrophic mistake and I, on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran, express my deep condolences to the families of victims of this painful catastrophe," he said.
 Rouhani added he had ordered "all relevant bodies to take all necessary actions (to ensure) compensation" to the families of those killed.
 Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences and ordered the armed forces to address "shortcomings" so that such a disaster does not happen again.
 The acknowledgement came after officials in Iran had for days categorically denied Western claims that the Ukraine International Airlines plane had been struck by a missile in a catastrophic error.
 The jet, which had been bound for Kiev, slammed into a field shortly after taking off from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport before dawn on Wednesday.
 It came only hours after Iran launched a wave of missiles at bases hosting American forces in Iraq in response to the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike.
 The aerospace commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards accepted full responsibility.
 But Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh said the missile operator acted independently, shooting down the Boeing 737 after mistaking it for a "cruise missile".
 The operator failed to obtain approval from his superiors because of disruptions to his communications system, he said.
 "He had 10 seconds to decide. He could have decided to strike or not to strike and under such circumstances he took the wrong decision."
 "It was a short-range missile that exploded next to the plane," Hajizadeh added.
 Iran had come under mounting international pressure to allow a "credible" investigation after video footage emerged appearing to show the plane being hit by a fast-moving object before a flash appears.
 Ukraine, Canada, Sweden and Afghanistan called for accountability after Iran's admission.
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnston said Iran's acknowledgement was an "important first step".
 The military was first to admit the error, saying the aircraft had been mistaken for a "hostile target".
 It said Iran had been at the highest level of alert after American "threats" and that the plane had turned and come close to a "sensitive" military site before it was hit due to "human error".
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded Iran punish those responsible for the downing of the plane and pay compensation.
 "We expect Iran... to bring the guilty to the courts," he said on Facebook, before his office announced he would speak later on the phone with Rouhani.
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau demanded "transparency, and justice for the families and loved ones of the victims".
 "This is a national tragedy, and all Canadians are mourning together."
 Sweden demanded a "complete and transparent probe" while Afghanistan said families of 13 of its citizens killed in the tragedy "deserve answers".
 Iran has invited the United States, Ukraine, Canada and others to join the crash investigation.
 It is Iran's worst civil aviation disaster since 1988 when the US military said it shot down an Iran Air plane over the Gulf by mistake, killing all 290 people on board.
 Video footage of Wednesday's incident, which The New York Times said it had verified, appeared to show the moment the airliner was hit.
 A fast-moving object is seen rising at an angle into the sky before a bright flash appears, which dims and then continues moving forward. Several seconds later, an explosion is heard and the sky lights up.
 Many airlines from around the world cancelled flights to and from Iran in the wake of the crash, or rerouted flights away from Iranian airspace.
 Ukraine International Airlines Saturday said its plane had received no warning from Tehran airport about a possible threat to its safety before it took off en route for Kiev.
 At a briefing by its president and vice president, the airline also denied the aircraft veered off its normal course after an Iranian military statement said the plane flew close to a sensitive military site of the elite Revolutionary Guards.
 The airline officials bristled at what they said were hints from Iran that the crew had not acted properly.
 The airline officials called on Iran to take full responsibility for the crash and said the Iranian authorities should have closed the airport.
 "If you play at war, you play as much as you want, but there are normal people around who you had to protect," Vice President Ihor Sosnovsky said.
 "If they are shooting from somewhere to somewhere, they were obliged to close the airport. Obliged. And then shoot as much as you want."
 He added that the plane had turned 15 degrees to the right after it had reached 6,000 feet, in accordance with the instructions of the airport dispatcher.
 Eleven Ukrainians, including nine crew, died in the crash, according to Ukrainian government figures.
 Yevhenii Dykhne, the president and chief executive of the airline, made an emotional opening statement to reporters saying the airline had not done anything wrong in terms of following security procedures.
 "At the time of departure from (Kiev's) Boryspil airport, the airline had no information about possible threats," he said. "At the time of departure from Tehran airport, it was exactly the same."
 The airline said Tehran airport was operating normally at the time its aircraft took off. Asked why there had been a delay in take-off, Dykhne said the captain had decided to offload some luggage because the plane was too heavily loaded.

In this political environment, wouldn’t it make sense to find bipartisan co- sponsors for important proposed legislation prior to an announcement in front of reporters?
 Sen. Jeff Smith, D-town of Brunswick, and Rep. Amanda Struck, D-Appleton, introduced a bill Monday that requires political campaigns that have racked up security costs during Wisconsin stops to pay outstanding bills before they could hold more campaign events in the state. Rep. Jodi Emerson, D-Eau Claire, and Smith spoke about the proposed legislation Monday in downtown Eau Claire.
 On the same day, Rep. Jesse James, R-Altoona, announced a new “tougher on crime” initiative. That initiative, as reported by WEAU-TV, includes measures to improve prosecutor accountability, processes and transparency, protection for crime victims and consequences for violent and repeat criminals.
 Both announced ideas are good and needed, but one for sure and maybe both will be dead on arrival because it seems that getting credit for the announcement is more important than the idea itself.
 We’ve elected these representatives to represent us, not the leadership in Madison and not the governor. When will our representatives actually work with the other side in bringing good legislation ideas forward?
 Both of these ideas could have been shared with the media and public, at the same time, in the same venue, starting with bipartisan support rather than hoping for it down the road. But for some reason, egos take over and there’s no extra room in the spotlight.
 Please leave your egos at the door and show some leadership. Meet with the other side and figure out what you agree on. Put the best legislation forward and make the announcement together.
 Let’s stop the nonsense of being in lockstep with the Madison leadership and start representing locally like it was meant to be. Let’s work across the “aisle” locally and bring good ideas forward together. Let’s be the example of the way it’s supposed to work.

CANTON — Twenty years into the life of the Canton Community Fund, a $25,000 matching grant has been provided to the fund by the Northern New York Community Foundation and a Canton couple.
 Peter and Kathy Wyckoff serve as advisers to the Brookmar Fund, a component of the NNY Community Foundation, which has allocated a portion of the $25,000 to support the Campaign for Canton, an initiative to develop a permanent endowment within the Community Foundation.
 The Canton Community Fund “was the first geographic-specific fund within the Community Foundation, created to broadly strengthen quality of life in a specific community and provide donors with a designated option,” the foundation wrote in a press release.
 Up to a total of $25,000, the Wyckoffs and the foundation will match any contributions made to the Canton Community Fund.
 “The people of Canton have led the way in building an opportunity for all to give where they live, in a way that has impact now and in the future,” foundation Executive Director Rande Richardson said.
 Since 1999, the Canton Community Fund has awarded a total of more than $75,000 through 100 grants to nonprofits in Canton, according to the foundation. The fund has been financially supported by individuals, families, organizations and businesses, as well as planned gifts.

SPRINGFIELD -- Two years after Illinois' Legislature approved new language for the U.S. Constitution codifying that rights cannot be denied due to gender, the Equal Rights Amendment gained enough state support to be ratified.
 Its potential implementation is more complicated, though.
 Virginia's General Assembly on Wednesday backed the addition of protections for women in the country's governing document. After both chambers accept each other's initiative, the commonwealth will become the 38th to ratify the amendment, pushing it across the necessary legal threshold for passage.
 But opponents argue that does not matter -- when the Equal Rights Amendment was introduced and passed by Congress in 1972, the body set a seven-year deadline for state ratification. It was later pushed to 1982. By then, only 35 states formally supported the language, five of which -- South Dakota, Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska and Tennessee -- withdrew their backing for the measure in the 1970s.
 Proponents point out the Constitution does not provide states the ability to rescind their support, or enforce a deadline for ratification. They also assert Congress' placement of its cutoff is important.
 Former Illinois state Rep. Steven Andersson, a Republican from Geneva and one of the amendment's sponsors two years ago, said the deadline is in the resolution introducing the amendment for state consideration, not in its actual text.
 The Constitution's 27th Amendment - the last one officially passed - provides a model of why the deadline is "ministerial," former Illinois state Rep. Lou Lang, a Skokie Democrat, said. He sponsored a bill in the House calling for Illinois' approval of the Equal Rights Amendment for about 25 years.
 The 27th Amendment provides that Congress cannot cut or increase its salary during a term. It passed in 1992 but was first introduced in America's first Congress more than 200 years ago. Several states ratified it by the late 1790s before it effectively "died," Andersson said.
 In the 1990s, a college student from the University of Texas at Austin revived the effort, and the amendment was added to the country's governing document -- an "outrageous length of time" after its debut, Lang said.
 Attorneys general from three states -- Alabama, South Dakota and Louisiana -- filed a lawsuit in December to prevent the Equal Rights Amendment from being added to the Constitution even with Virginia's approval.
 In response to the suit, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a memo that Congress' deadline is constitutionally allowed and therefore prevents the amendment's passage.
 There are several legislative efforts to extend that limit, and the extension has the support of a number of Illinois' congressional delegation.
 Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Illinois' 9th District, said she would work to advance the amendment at the Congressional level.
 "The Equal Rights Amendment is long overdue, and I will continue to work with my colleagues and advocates to push for its enactment following ratification in Virginia. I am an original co-sponsor of H.J. Resolution 38, which currently has 218 co-sponsors, that clarifies that this amendment should take effect," Schakowsky said in an email statement.
 Andersson and Lang agree the question will go straight to federal courts to settle. Litigation is "ramping up as we speak," Andersson said.
 "The people who are opposed to this will make up anything to prove their point. They've tried to say it's about gay rights -- it isn't, and the U.S. Supreme Court has already affirmed those rights; they'll say it's about abortion -- it has nothing to do with abortion," Lang said. "The real question is a constitutional one."
 Illinois' Constitution already includes an equal rights section, ensuring "the equal protection of the laws shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex by the state or its units of local governments and school districts."
 No matter what happens with the federal proposal, Andersson added, the action taken by Virginia's General Assembly marked "a momentous, historic day." He drove 12 hours from Chicago to the Mother of Presidents, as the commonwealth is nicknamed, to be there.
 Lang said encouraging Illinois' ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment was a "labor of love for [him] for a very long time."
 "It should never have been as hard as it was to pass," he said. "This is an issue that is well overdue, and to treat women in America as second-class citizens in the year of 2020 would be beyond wrong -- it would be immoral. In a very real way, I think Illinois kind of jump-started the process for Virginia."
 Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a statement that he has been a lifelong advocate for women's rights.
 "I'm overjoyed to see three-fourths of the United States ratify the Equal Rights Amendment," Pritzker said. "These 24 words cement women's equality into our Constitution and open a new chapter in American history where discrimination on the basis of sex is no longer tolerated. Our nation has a moral imperative to adopt this groundbreaking and common-sense statement as the 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution."
 And a spokesperson for Attorney General Kwame Raoul, who voted in support of the Equal Rights Amendment as a senator two years ago, said the office is "evaluating all options to ensure that equal rights are not contingent upon a person's gender or sex."

 Ukraine, Canada, Sweden and Afghanistan called for accountability after Iran´s admission.
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnston said Iran´s acknowledgement was an "important first step".
 The military was first to admit the error, saying the aircraft had been mistaken for a "hostile target".
 It said Iran had been at the highest level of alert after American "threats" and that the plane had turned and come close to a "sensitive" military site before it was hit due to "human error".
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded Iran punish those responsible for the downing of the plane and pay compensation.
 "We expect Iran... to bring the guilty to the courts," he said on Facebook, before his office announced he would speak later on the phone with Rouhani.
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau demanded "transparency, and justice for the families and loved ones of the victims".
 "This is a national tragedy, and all Canadians are mourning together."
 Sweden demanded a "complete and transparent probe" while Afghanistan said families of 13 of its citizens killed in the tragedy "deserve answers".
 Iran has invited the United States, Ukraine, Canada and others to join the crash investigation.
 It is Iran´s worst civil aviation disaster since 1988 when the US military said it shot down an Iran Air plane over the Gulf by mistake, killing all 290 people on board.
 Video footage of Wednesday´s incident, which The New York Times said it had verified, appeared to show the moment the airliner was hit.
 A fast-moving object is seen rising at an angle into the sky before a bright flash appears, which dims and then continues moving forward. Several seconds later, an explosion is heard and the sky lights up.
 Many airlines from around the world cancelled flights to and from Iran in the wake of the crash, or rerouted flights away from Iranian airspace.
 Ukraine International Airlines Saturday said its plane had received no warning from Tehran airport about a possible threat to its safety before it took off en route for Kiev.
 At a briefing by its president and vice president, the airline also denied the aircraft veered off its normal course after an Iranian military statement said the plane flew close to a sensitive military site of the elite Revolutionary Guards.
 The airline officials bristled at what they said were hints from Iran that the crew had not acted properly.
 The airline officials called on Iran to take full responsibility for the crash and said the Iranian authorities should have closed the airport.
 “If you play at war, you play as much as you want, but there are normal people around who you had to protect,” Vice President Ihor Sosnovsky said.
 “If they are shooting from somewhere to somewhere, they were obliged to close the airport. Obliged. And then shoot as much as you want.”
 He added that the plane had turned 15 degrees to the right after it had reached 6,000 feet, in accordance with the instructions of the airport dispatcher.
 Eleven Ukrainians, including nine crew, died in the crash, according to Ukrainian government figures.
 Yevhenii Dykhne, the president and chief executive of the airline, made an emotional opening statement to reporters saying the airline had not done anything wrong in terms of following security procedures.
 “At the time of departure from (Kiev’s) Boryspil airport, the airline had no information about possible threats,” he said. “At the time of departure from Tehran airport, it was exactly the same.”
 The airline said Tehran airport was operating normally at the time its aircraft took off. Asked why there had been a delay in take-off, Dykhne said the captain had decided to offload some luggage because the plane was too heavily loaded.

Jamundi, Jan 18 AP A remote town was on edge Friday after at least five people were found shot to death, highlighting Colombias struggle to bring peace to rural areas where drug crops are abundant and illegal armed groups are active. The killings happened overnight in an isolated part of the Jamundi municipality in southwestern Colombia and also left two vehicles incinerated, officials said. It was the third massacre in Jamundi in the past year.Authorities said two of the bodies were found under a bullet-riddled vehicle while three were located farther up a dirt road. All five had to be carried by horse to a nearby school and then flown by helicopter to a morgue, due to both dangerous conditions in the area and a lack of reliable roads. Manuel Antonio Vsquez, commander of the Cali metropolitan police, said investigators believe the bloodshed stemmed from a conflict among illegal armed groups, with one criminal band suspecting that the victims were either from a rival gang competing for drug territory or a team of state investigators working in the region.An estimated 230 soldiers were dispatched to the area in response. We are here guaranteeing the security of inhabitants, Vsquez said.Local officials urged the national government to build better roads, provide basic services like security, health care and education and help substitute coca crops as a means of rooting out illegal armed groups. There are an estimated 1,000 hectares 2,470 acres of illicit crops in the area. We need to confront this with a greater institutional presence, Jamundi Mayor Andrs Felipe Ramrez said after the killings.Last January, four members of a Jamundi farm family that cultivated crops like bananas and yucca were found shot to death, authorities told local media at the time.

 The fifth of the 15-meet series on May 28 will be staged in the Stadio San Paolo in Naples with Rome's Stadio Olimpico unavailable ahead of the UEFA European championships.
 The Italian capital will host four Euro 2020 matches including the opening game on June 12.
 The San Paolo Stadium, home to Italian football club Napoli, was recently renovated for the 2019 Summer Universiade and can host 55,000 spectators.
 Since the Golden Gala was inaugurated in 1980 Rome has hosted the annual event apart from in 1988 (Verona), 1989 (Pescara) and 1990 (Bologna) when the Stadio Olimpico was undergoing work ahead of the 1990 FIFA World Cup.

Nearly five years after the Legislature authorized the Oklahoma Election Board to launch an online voter registration system, the work remains unfinished.
   
 Election officials told Oklahoma Watch this week that a full online voter registration platform will not be ready this year, including for November's pivotal presidential election.
   
 The state launched an online tool two years ago that allows registered voters to update their information. But development of a similar platform to register new voters online has been delayed repeatedly since the 2015 authorizing legislation was passed.
   
 In September 2018, election officials said they were hopeful the system would be ready for the 2020 elections. But that won't be the case.
   
 The news is a blow to voter-access advocates who argue that offering online registration is one of the top ways to improve the state's traditionally low voter turnout. They say Oklahoma will lag the 37 other states that offer this option.
   
 The problem isn't just about the cost.
   
 State Election Board Secretary Paul Zirax said election officials are waiting for the Department of Public Safety to complete computer upgrades that would allow online voter registrations to be cross-referenced with applicants' driver's licenses or state-issued ID cards.
   
 That work, which is related to the state's long-running efforts to comply with the federal REAL ID Act, is expected to be completed this year. If that occurs, Zirax said, there should be enough money already budgeted to launch the online voter registration by the end of 2021.
   
 "As Oklahoma's chief election official, I strongly support online voter registration," he said. "However, online voter registration should only launch when it is both technically feasible and secure, and not before."
   
 That timetable is not good enough for at least one lawmaker.
   
 Sen. Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, recently filed a bill that requires the Election Board to establish a secure online voter registration website by March 1, 2021.
   
 Kirt said it's her hope that the legislation will create a greater sense of urgency for the Department of Public Safety and the Election Board to get the work done - or it could push the state to look at new options.
   
 "From the beginning the (Election Board) was marrying their system to the Department of Public Safety system, and clearly that is behind schedule," she said. "My concern is that if that's an ongoing problem, maybe there should be another system for authenticating identification."
   
 Kirt said she chose March 1, 2021, because it would ensure the website is up for local elections that year and for the run-up to 2022, when statewide races will include the governor's office.
   
 "I think clearly we don't have enough people voting in our state," she said. "We don't have eligible voters voting. We don't have people registering at the rate we need to and we need more people patriating. We need to build trust in government and people having a voice is part of that."
   
 Zirax said he has concerns about the bill and called the deadline "not realistic." However, he said, the bill is "well-intended and can easily be amended by the Legislature with a more feasible deadline that is contingent on successful testing for security and functionality."
   
 Kirt said she's not ready to start negotiating the bill language, but she's willing to see how her fellow lawmakers feel about it.
   
 The bigger challenge could be getting the bill heard in committee.
   
 Kirt said she's been notified by Republican leaders that the bill will be assigned to the Senate Rules Committee, where many bills die without a vote because of the volume of work the committee usually sees.
   
 A 2017 analysis by Oklahoma Watch found that of the 60 bills introduced since 2015 that sought to expand or create new options for voting or registering to vote, most didn't even get a committee hearing. All but 10 failed to reach the governor's desk.
   
 Since then, few voting-related bills have seen much traction in the Legislature.
   
 Among the unsuccessful proposals in the last two years were creating automatic voter registration, making it easier for felons to have their voting rights restored, allowing 16-year-olds to preregister to vote and expanding early voting hours.

Most stars appear white to the eye, although a closer look will reveal hints of blue, yellow, orange and red. What about green?      Alas, astronomers say there are no green stars, but I still find it hard to believe.      Most stars appear white to the eye, but that is primarily because our retinas are not sensitive to color in low light conditions. In a backyard telescope, beautiful swathes of stellar clouds, such as the Great Nebula in Orion (M42, visible in the south in mid-March evenings just below the famous three "belt stars" of Orion), appear white. Long exposure color photographs bring out vivid colors, which can do a disservice to the stargazer if one expects the same thing at the telescope eyepiece.      Brighter colored stars do stand out in shades of blue, yellow, orange and red. Many others still appear white. With the unaided eye, you can appreciate the orange-red star Betelgeuse on the upper left corner of Orion, or the bright yellow star Capella high overhead. Brilliant Sirius gleams to the lower left of Orion and is distinctly bluish-white. Aim binoculars at the outer, top tip of the Big Dipper "bowl," which is named Dubhe and is vivid orange.      Stars vary in color with their surface temperature and are classified by "spectral types" listing stars by letters. Cooler stars with spectral types K or M radiate most of their energy in the red end of the spectrum. Hotter stars, such as spectral types O and B, emit mostly at blue and ultraviolet wavelengths. Our sun is of spectral type G and is yellowish-white.      Spectroscopes reveal the stellar spectrum, and in the rainbow of light, there is always a component of green! Even if the star's light is predominantly another shade, there is still green light! Unfortunately, our eyes do not perceive a star as green because those with the right temperature to mainly emit green light, emit starlight in a manner that is blended by our eye as white.      Spectrums of stars also reveal dark lines where elements making up the star - such as hydrogen or helium - absorb narrow frequencies of the light, which show up as thin dark lines in the color. Like a fingerprint, astronomers are able to learn the chemical makeup of stars and other celestial bodies this way.      Occasionally we can even see green sunlight. When the conditions are right at sunset or sunrise, a green spot of light is visible above the upper rim of the disk of the sun. Called the "green flash," it normally is seen for no more than a second or two. On rare occasions, it has been seen like a green ray shooting up from the point of sunset or sunrise.      The green flash is caused by refraction, with the component colors of the sunlight split. Green flashes are more likely to be seen in stable, clean air, when more of the light of the low sun reaches the observer's eyes without being scattered in the atmosphere. They usually are seen on a flat horizon such as over the ocean.      Now, where are the purple stars?      What about the planets? The Earth has lots of green. The planet Uranus has a bluish-green hue as a result of methane in its atmosphere. Venus, so bright in the evening sky (look southwest), is really white.      Last quarter moon occurred Jan. 17-18. After this, watch for the early morning crescent, waning towards new moon on Jan. 24. The moon, by the way, is also not green despite the cheese it's supposed to be made of.

The Meghalaya Human Rights Commission MHRC has directed the state government to institute an enquiry into the death of a woman allegedly due to electrocution in West Garo Hills District and to submit a detailed report within 30 days. The Commission said a suo moto case has been registered by the Commission headed by acting Chairperson PJP Hanaman and Judicial member, B Giri, a statement said on Friday. The death as reported appears to reveal sheer negligence and callousness of the Meghalaya Power Distribution Corporation Ltd MePDCL which is tasked with the maintenance and supervision of high power transmission line to the whole state, it said. The Commission has issued notice to the state government and to the MePDCL. The Commission has directed the State Government to institute an enquiry into the incident which has taken the life of a poor woman and to submit a detailed report to the commission within 30 days, the statement said. According to the report, one Hensolin D Sangma, mother of two was out on Wednesday cutting overgrown banana plants when she came in contact with live wire from 33 KV transmission line that was just above one of the banana plant. The contact with live wire electrocuted her and her lifeless body was found by her families at the site a few hours later..

ATHENS: At least 12 people died on Saturday when a boat loaded with asylum- seekers sank in the Ionian Sea, the Greek coastguard said.
 "So far 12 bodies have been recovered. The search and rescue operation continues," they said in a statement, adding that they had rescued more than 20 survivors.
 "Three of them are being flown by helicopter to (the nearest hospital) for emergency treatment," the statement added. There were no immediate details on the identity of those on board.
 The boat, which was carrying around 50 people, took on water near the island of Paxi during an apparent attempt to reach Italy.
 At this point someone on board issued a distress call, the authorities said.
 Six coastguard patrol boats and three helicopters were engaged in the continuing rescue effort, authorities said.
 Four passing cargo ships were also assisting the operation, the coastguard said.
 Thousands of migrants and refugees have died in recent years while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea in small, overloaded boats.
 With Greece's northern borders closed to migrants seeking to reach western Europe, some are trying clandestine routes to quit the country, such as mountain routes into Albania or by sailing to neighbouring Italy.
 Twenty-two people have died or are still missing in migrant boat sinkings in the Mediterranean just this month, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Another 73 persons were rescued in separate incidents in the Aegean between Friday and Saturday, the Greek coastguard added. Greece in 2019 again became the main entry into Europe for migrants and refugees. The UN refugee agency recorded more than 55,000 arrivals by sea, and more than 14,000 via the land border with Turkey.
 Greece's new conservative government has struggled to manage hundreds of new asylum-seeker arrivals on a daily basis from the coast of neighbouring Turkey.

On Jan. 5, his lifetime of dedication was rewarded when Smith was inducted into the Indiana Association of Fairs Hall of Fame. The honor came at the association’s 100th annual convention in Indianapolis.
 Only four people can be selected for the Hall of Fame each year — one from each quadrant of the state.
 “If you ever have the chance to see the resumes of those people who are nominated for the Hall of Fame, it’s remarkable,” said Auburn Mayor Mike Ley, an officer of the DeKalb fair board. “Some of them, I joke, they must have been conceived on the fairgrounds to have that many years involved in their fair associations.”
 Smith, 76, grew up on a farm at the east edge of Auburn and participated in 4-H as a boy.
 When he was a student at Auburn High School, Smith and his fellow agriculture students would walk two blocks east to the fairgrounds to help set up pens and assemble gates for the fair’s livestock exhibits.
 His steer won the grand championship at the 1958 fair, when he was 15 years old.
 Smith enrolled at Michigan State University, where he excelled in livestock judging and traveled to competitions throughout the nation. He earned a bachelor’s degree, then returned home to the family farm and began volunteering as a 4-H leader.
 Smith recalls nailing boards on gates for the fair’s hog barn, before steel pens came along.
 “Every year we had to go in and fix the gates the week before the fair, because some of the pigs would chew them in two or get to fighting and break boards in between,” he said with a chuckle.
 He served on the 4-H auction committee for 40 years, including 30 years as treasurer, writing a check to each 4-H’er who sold an animal. He worked as a superintendent of the cattle barn and the swine carcass show.
 Smith joined the fair’s governing board in 1979. His service includes 10 years on the executive board and three years as vice president.
 He considers a recent project, serving on a committee to build a new horse barn at the fairgrounds in 2014, as one of his top accomplishments. Building the barn required raising $700,000 in contributions.
 A list of Smith’s involvement in the community takes up a couple of typed pages in his nomination for the Hall of Fame.
 In agriculture, he has served on the Purdue Extension Board, DeKalb County Soil and Water Conservation District board, Northeast Indiana Angus Association, Northeast Indiana Swine Association and DeKalb Agra cooperative board,
 He also plays key roles on the DeKalb Outdoor Theater board, the Auburn Plan Commission and Auburn Board of Zoning Appeals, and he has been involved with the Auburn Presbyterian Church and Boy Scouts.

enhance the two navies' capability to deal with maritime terrorism and crime together.
 The nine-day exercise is taking place amid major developments in the region especially in neighbouring waters. The monitoring reports show extremely satisfying results.
 According to Chinese media reports the exercise, dubbed "Sea Guardians-2020," started in the port city of Karachi and being held in the North Arabian Sea until Tuesday, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Daily reported.
 The Chinese troops mainly come from the PLA Southern Theater Command Navy, including guided missile destroyer Yinchuan, guided missile frigate Yuncheng, comprehensive supplement ship Weishanhu, submarine rescue ship Liugongdao and two vessel-based helicopters.
 Pakistan will have two frigates, two missile boats, a fixed-wing anti- submarine aircraft and two vessel-based helicopters in the drills.
 They are conducting joint cruising, air defence, maritime interception, anti- submarine and live-fire shooting exercises at sea.
 The goal of the Sea Guardians-2020 drills is to boost the two countries' military cooperation, enhance their all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, build a safe maritime environment and enhance the two navies' capability to deal with maritime terrorism and crime together, the PLA Daily report said.
 This joint exercise is not related to regional affairs and is not aimed at any third party, the PLA Daily added.
 It is a part of the annual cooperation plan between the Pakistani and Chinese military forces, said Ren Guoqiang, a defence ministry spokesperson, at a routine press conference, when announcing the exercise.

The latest quake occurred at 8:54 am local time (1254 GMT) around 13 kilometers (eight miles) southeast of Guanica, a town on the island´s southern Caribbean coastline that was hard hit by earlier quakes. The USGS revised its initial report of a 6.0 magnitude quake to 5.9. It follows a 6.4 magnitude quake Tuesday that killed one person, knocked out electric power and caused widespread damage. Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez declared a state of emergency after Tuesday´s quake, which forced an automatic shutdown of the power grid. Puerto Rico´s electric power authority reported outages in the towns of Ponce, Lares, Adjuntas and San German after the latest quake. The Pacific Tsunami Information Center in Hawaii issued a statement saying there was “no significant tsunami threat” but a small possibility of tsunami waves along coasts nearest the epicenter.
 The island is still recovering from Hurricane Maria, which came ashore more than two years ago as a devastating Category 4 storm. Starting December 28, a wave of tremors have swept the island, putting residents on edge. The 6.4 quake on January 7 came a day after a 5.8 magnitude quake; it was followed by major aftershocks.

Horrible tragedies befall nations when real politic overwhelms the larger dominant interests of its people providing eager enemies lurking around in anticipation of any signs of weakness to exploit and rip one apart. The same happened with East Pakistan, the misrule, mistrust turning into a toxic environment ending in a cataclysmic episode of country's history.
 In a recent book that uncovers and establishes the Indian Navy's clandestine terrorism and covert actions in East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, in 1971, "Operation X: The Untold Story of India's Covert Naval War in East Pakistan" by Sandeep Unnithan and Captain M.N.R. Samant, gives a very graphic account of how the Indian naval intelligence under direct orders from the naval chief Admiral Nanda trained and equipped the refugees from East Pakistan to direct a seaborne insurgency against the Pakistan Navy.
 India had long been cultivating assets in East Pakistan and assigned them various missions in sabotage and subversion. Like the person who tried to take Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas' aircraft to India, there were men in the navy too assigned to do just that.
 The Pakistan Navy submariners were training on a new Daphne class submarine PNS Mangro in Toulon, France.
 Working in the shadows with their Indian Navy handlers, 11 sailors and officers, led by Abdul Wahed Chowdhury and Lt Commander Moazzam Hossain, tried to take over the submarine, kill and imprison the patriotic officers and to commandeer it to the subcontinental theatre of Pak-India hostilities for launching attacks against Pakistan's commercial and naval ports and ships. By sheer luck, the Pakistan Naval Intelligence came to learn of the plot and threw a dragnet before the plan could be executed.
 This followed an intense gunfight, killing one of the dissident officials, while the 10 others including Abdul Wahed Chowdhury, who had led the mutiny along with Lt Commander Moazzam Hossain, managed to escape. Like the classic cloak and dagger operations, with the help of Indian intelligence tentacles, one of them reached London, the others went to Marseilles and from Madrid, finally reached Geneva, Switzerland, and made their way to the ultimate destination, the Indian Embassy. They were provided with passports and on April 9 they flew for Bombay on board an Air India flight. Welcomed by their handlers on reaching India, they were taken to New Delhi where the next darker and ominous chapter was to be unfolded.
 Writing about the book, Sandeep Unnithan, who is the main author of the book, says "the Indian Navy, which stood frustrated and helpless during the 1965 war with Pakistan, saw a fleeting opportunity in 1971 to redeem themselves." Covert operations, Unnithan says, always have a larger strategic game plan, but the desperation of Admiral S.M. Nanda, India's naval chief, to ensure that the Indian Navy plays an important part in the Bangladesh Liberation landscape was the driving force.
 Historically, during the 1965 war with Pakistan, the Indian Navy could not get any real chance of significantly taking part in the war. Most of their assets were forced to remain docked in the ports by the Pakistani subs lurking outside their major naval ports, the strategic radar station Dwarka was destroyed plunging them into a virtual communication dark… though they did carry out some tactical actions but 1971 gave them the opportunity to salvage what they had lost.
 After the aborted attempt to hijack a Pakistani submarine, the Indian naval chief found another use for the defecting submariners. The Bengali officers were privy to valuable and valid intelligence on Pak Navy's assets, command nodes, strength, deployments, naval infrastructure and communication facilities in East Pakistan, giving a deep insight to the planners about the Pakistan Navy's plans and actions. Pakistan's counterterrorism, counterinsurgency and counter intelligence campaigns led by operations Searchlight and Barisal had trounced Mukti Bahni and driven them back to India where it was modified into a guerrilla warfare.
 Admiral Nanda and Director Intelligence Captain Mihir Roy strategized to subvert and sabotage Pakistan's SLOCs (sea lines of communication) in the East Pakistan theatre through a dirty and dangerous sea-based insurgency.
 Bangladesh is dotted with canals and sea ports that are critical to economy and logistics and by the same argument served as lifeline for the Pakistani troops fighting treason and hostile enemy action in 1971. This led to putting Operation X into action, by raising an expendable Mukti Bahni saboteur force to wage sea-based insurgency to destroy Pakistan's war waging potential. Indian intelligence's long-time asset, Abdul Wahed Chowdhury, who had led the submariners revolt in France, offered himself eagerly for the new task, in return for political asylum in India.
 The eight Bengali submariners along with nine active duty Indian Navy personnel began to run a training and operational camp near Plassey, Krishnanagar, West Bengal. The Camp 2 Plassey, code named C2P was supervised by Commander Samant (co-author) who later also directed the insurgent actions. There was another similar camp in Tripura too. Around 150 East Pakistani youth were selected from the refugee camps and trained in combat diving, mine- laying, underwater demolitions and small arms firing.
 The Operation-X had different components including Operation Jackpot and Force Alpha and triggered a murky new power play. The Operation Jackpot was aimed to attack and sabotage the riverine and sea commercial and naval ports and destroy the naval and commercial boats and ships bringing essential military supplies from West Pakistan and those that could pose any threat in the naval actions. With the help of border guards and the Indian Army, four groups of trained and equipped Mukti Bahni terrorists were sneaked into East Pakistan and brought to the staging areas by August 12. Under a predetermined arrangement, the Calcutta Radio had to broadcast songs, at specific time, containing coded instructions to mount the vicious attack.
 The first "warning" song was played on 13 August and the second "action" song on 14 August.
 Taking cue on Aug 16, Chittagong and Mongla sea ports and critical Chandpur and Narayanganj river ports were attacked, damaging the ports' infrastructure and several ships and other platforms, rendering them out of action.
 According to Pakistan Navy officers in know of things, but not cleared to speak on record about them, the initial attacks which caught them off guard, followed a string of other attempts on the oil depots at Narayanganj, Bogra, Faridpur and Chittagong but security and patrolling actions and engagements with the terrorist groups prevented the sabotage attempts.
 All subversive actions to take out the critical Hardinge Bridge were also foiled. They recalled local security and the SSG Navy ambushed some of the Mukti Bahni groups at their safe houses, killing some and rounding up several others. This was one part only.
 Under the Operation X, Admiral Nanda had also trained the Mukti Bahni saboteurs to carry out mining operations at the sea ports using gunboats, alongside attacking unsuspecting Pakistan Navy ships and boats by a task force code named Force Alpha. The Indian Navy provided two of the three gunboats for the task force.
 The Force Alpha comprising gunboats Palash and Padma, accompanied by INS Panvel, under the command of their camp coordinator Commander M. N. Samant, were ordered to mine Mongla port.
 But on way to the mission they were attacked and destroyed by the Indian Air Force jets in the Pussur River in a case of friendly fire, thus bringing an end to the misadventure.
 Those were difficult and tragic times for Pakistan and India used all its resources to destabilize but things have changed little since then; RAW's terrorist actions in Pakistan continue to this day.

Since President Trump ordered the killing of Iran's General Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3, politicians and citizens alike have questioned the operation's legitimacy. In the absence of a declaration of war, was the targeted killing of an enemy on foreign soil justified? Further, was it effective?
   
 The first question, was Soleimani's killing justified, does not allow for a short answer. Justified by what measure? Expediency? Safety? Morality? Ethicists have wrestled with such questions for centuries and have provided guidelines for what is just.
   
 The idea that war may sometimes be justified is thousands of years old. Aristotle introduced the concept into the West, and St. Augustine revisited the idea from a biblically informed and classically trained mindset. In just war theory, certain thresholds must be met before an act of violence can be considered just. Does the killing of Soleimani meet those thresholds?
   
 The first threshold is that the act of violence must be ordered by a legitimate authority. Since President Trump ordered the military action, and he is the U.S. commander in chief, this qualification seems to be met. One might object, however, that without the Iraqi government's consent - Soleimani was in Iraq at the time - the U.S. president's authority was not legitimate.
   
 The second threshold requires there to be sufficient cause to take the violent action. It could be (and has been) argued that, since General Soleimani had been responsible for a campaign of terror and death, the second threshold had already been met.
   
 Another requirement is that the act of violence was righteously motivated. Motivation is difficult to determine and President Trump's changing explanations - sometimes claiming he was "preventing imminent and sinister attacks" and at other times sounding like he was enacting vengeance - do not help. But since motive is so hard to determine, it might be best to leave this one alone.
   
 Just war theory also requires that the act of violence be a last resort. Since other actions, notably economic sanctions, were previously taken, one could argue this threshold has been met. A further requirement is that the action be proportionate to the desired intent. This is hard to discern, given the administration's equivocal explanations.
   
 Perhaps the most challenging threshold to be met is that the action can be reasonably expected to improve the situation - that it is likely to right wrongs and increase the probability of lasting peace. With this, we move from the question of the action's justification to that of its effectiveness.
   
 Commentators who applaud Mr. Trump's decision are quick to make the case that the killing of the general has made the world a safer place. Soleimani, they say, was the hinge on which the Iranian campaign of destabilization turned. They regard him as a unique and irreplaceable evil genius whose death will impede Iran's campaign of regional violence for the foreseeable future.
   
 Maybe. But predicting the future is not in my skill set and I've never known anyone, political commentators included, who have mastered it. What I do know is that evil will not be overcome by evil. It will only be overcome by good.
   
 Was the killing of Soleimani justified? Who knows? Will it be effective? It is doubtful. In the short term, his death may hinder Iran's efforts to destabilize regional governments and drive the U.S. military out of the Middle East. In the long term, his death may elevate equally capable military officers and inspire an enduring hatred of the U.S. among a younger generation. The killing of one terrorist may inspire a thousand to take his place.
   
 The only way to overcome evil, as St. Paul made clear, is with good. This may seem naive but it is actually efficient. Truth is one example of an overcoming good. Rather than rely on military might alone, our leaders should make known to the people of Iran the truth about General Soleimani and the regime he served. Their ongoing campaign of violence and hatred should be exposed.
   
 If it is argued that such an approach underestimates the evil that Iran represents, one might counter that it correctly estimates the good that truth accomplishes. If our goal is lasting peace, it is the epitome of naivete to believe that military action alone can accomplish it.

President Rouhani says probe found missiles fired due to human error; calls tragedy unforgivable mistake; orders compensation to affected families; Khamenei ordered armed forces to address shortcomings; Ukraine, Canada, Sweden, Afghanistan call for accountability; Ukraine International Airlines says plane received no warning of possible threat; denies plane veered off its normal course'
 TEHRAN: Iran said on Saturday it "unintentionally" shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet, killing all 176 people aboard, in an abrupt about-turn after initially denying Western claims it was struck by a missile.
 President Hassan Rouhani said a military probe into the tragedy had found "missiles fired due to human error" brought down the Boeing 737, calling it an "unforgivable mistake".
 He said Iran had been on alert for possible US attacks after Soleimani´s "martyrdom".
 "Iran is very much saddened by this catastrophic mistake and I, on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran, express my deep condolences to the families of victims of this painful catastrophe," he said.
 Rouhani added he had ordered "all relevant bodies to take all necessary actions (to ensure) compensation" to the families of those killed.
 Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences and ordered the armed forces to address "shortcomings" so that such a disaster does not happen again.
 The acknowledgement came after officials in Iran had for days categorically denied Western claims that the Ukraine International Airlines plane had been struck by a missile in a catastrophic error.
 The jet, which had been bound for Kiev, slammed into a field shortly after taking off from Tehran´s Imam Khomeini International Airport before dawn on Wednesday.
 It came only hours after Iran launched a wave of missiles at bases hosting American forces in Iraq in response to the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike.
 The aerospace commander of Iran´s Revolutionary Guards accepted full responsibility.
 But Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh said the missile operator acted independently, shooting down the Boeing 737 after mistaking it for a "cruise missile".
 The operator failed to obtain approval from his superiors because of disruptions to his communications system, he said.
 "He had 10 seconds to decide. He could have decided to strike or not to strike and under such circumstances he took the wrong decision."
 "It was a short-range missile that exploded next to the plane," Hajizadeh added.
 Iran had come under mounting international pressure to allow a "credible" investigation after video footage emerged appearing to show the plane being hit by a fast-moving object before a flash appears.
 Ukraine, Canada, Sweden and Afghanistan called for accountability after Iran´s admission.
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnston said Iran´s acknowledgement was an "important first step".
 The military was first to admit the error, saying the aircraft had been mistaken for a "hostile target".
 It said Iran had been at the highest level of alert after American "threats" and that the plane had turned and come close to a "sensitive" military site before it was hit due to "human error".
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded Iran punish those responsible for the downing of the plane and pay compensation.
 "We expect Iran... to bring the guilty to the courts," he said on Facebook, before his office announced he would speak later on the phone with Rouhani.
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau demanded "transparency, and justice for the families and loved ones of the victims".
 "This is a national tragedy, and all Canadians are mourning together."
 Sweden demanded a "complete and transparent probe" while Afghanistan said families of 13 of its citizens killed in the tragedy "deserve answers".
 Iran has invited the United States, Ukraine, Canada and others to join the crash investigation.
 It is Iran´s worst civil aviation disaster since 1988 when the US military said it shot down an Iran Air plane over the Gulf by mistake, killing all 290 people on board.
 Video footage of Wednesday´s incident, which The New York Times said it had verified, appeared to show the moment the airliner was hit.
 A fast-moving object is seen rising at an angle into the sky before a bright flash appears, which dims and then continues moving forward. Several seconds later, an explosion is heard and the sky lights up.
 Many airlines from around the world cancelled flights to and from Iran in the wake of the crash, or rerouted flights away from Iranian airspace.
 Ukraine International Airlines Saturday said its plane had received no warning from Tehran airport about a possible threat to its safety before it took off en route for Kiev.
 At a briefing by its president and vice president, the airline also denied the aircraft veered off its normal course after an Iranian military statement said the plane flew close to a sensitive military site of the elite Revolutionary Guards.
 The airline officials bristled at what they said were hints from Iran that the crew had not acted properly.
 The airline officials called on Iran to take full responsibility for the crash and said the Iranian authorities should have closed the airport.
 "If you play at war, you play as much as you want, but there are normal people around who you had to protect," Vice President Ihor Sosnovsky said.
 "If they are shooting from somewhere to somewhere, they were obliged to close the airport. Obliged. And then shoot as much as you want."
 He added that the plane had turned 15 degrees to the right after it had reached 6,000 feet, in accordance with the instructions of the airport dispatcher.
 Eleven Ukrainians, including nine crew, died in the crash, according to Ukrainian government figures.
 Yevhenii Dykhne, the president and chief executive of the airline, made an emotional opening statement to reporters saying the airline had not done anything wrong in terms of following security procedures.
 "At the time of departure from (Kiev's) Boryspil airport, the airline had no information about possible threats," he said. "At the time of departure from Tehran airport, it was exactly the same."
 The airline said Tehran airport was operating normally at the time its aircraft took off. Asked why there had been a delay in take-off, Dykhne said the captain had decided to offload some luggage because the plane was too heavily loaded.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Saturday immediately reacted to admission from Iran that it had shot down the Ukrainian passenger plane as a result of 'human error at time of crisis caused by US adventurism'.
 As many as 176 passengers were on board from various countries who all perished as a result of this 'human error'. The aerospace commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards accepted full responsibility for the shooting down of the Ukrainian passenger jet.
 Earlier, in a tweet, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said, "Armed Forces' internal investigation has concluded that regrettably missiles fired due to human error caused the horrific crash of the Ukrainian plane & death of 176 innocent people."
 From the Foreign Office, a response came from Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, "Iran's confession of downing Ukrainian passenger plane should ease up tensions as the region can neither endure tension nor can it tolerate war anymore."
 Qureshi spoke on the eve of his departure to Tehran which will be the first capital in Pakistan's attempt to de-escalate tensions in the region which started with the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani by the United States. He added that the conflict between Iran and the United States should de-escalate and US President Donald Trump's recent statement was a ray of hope in this regard.
 On Friday, the foreign minister had met with new Iranian ambassador to Pakistan Syed Mohammad Ali Hosseini, who reaffirmed that his government under no circumstances wants any escalation in the Middle East.
 A statement from the office of the foreign minister said that Pakistan would play an active role to reduce growing tensions in the region and he will hold meeting with the Iranian leadership in Tehran.
 "On Prime Minister Imran Khan's instructions, I am going to visit Iran, and we plan on visiting Saudi Arabia and the United States of America shortly after," he said, adding that he hoped to meet with his Saudi counterpart as well.
 Later, the minister had a telephonic conversation with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu on the latest situation in the Middle East. Pakistan and Turkey are firming up fresh dates for the postponed visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Pakistan.

LAHORE: Punjab Governor Chaudhry Muhammad Sarwar has said the government and the opposition are on the same page in the interest of the country.
 Difference of opinion is the magnificence of democracy but political parties are united on the point to take Pakistan further consensually. Elimination of terrorism, corruption and resolving economic and other problems is necessary for the country and the nation, and there will be no compromise on it.
 He stated this while talking to an overseas Pakistani, Mian Tariq Javed, players and office-bearers of Punjab Judo Association and various delegations led by Chaudhry Asim and others.
 The Punjab governor said, "From day one, we are saying that we do not have any personal grudge with the opposition and we are pursuing the agenda to get Pakistan rid of corruption, violence, injustice, price-hike, unemployment and other problems."
 The way the opposition is extending cooperation to the government in the parliament for public and country's interest is indeed commendable, as it will strengthen democracy, parliament and the country, he said.
 Presently, the government is faced with economic challenges and the menace of terrorism against which the political and religious parties are united.
 He said Pakistani armed forces and other security forces were fighting against terrorism effectively, while the entire nation was standing with its defense institutions.
 Those who martyred innocent people through terror attack in a Quetta mosque can never be the Muslims, he said, adding, "Our sympathies are very much with the families of martyrs."
 In a meeting with players and office-bearers of Punjab Judo Association, Punjab Governor Chaudhry Muhammad Sarwar felicitated the players on winning 32 gold, 41 silver and 59 bronze medals in the 13th South Asian Games.
 He said that Pakistanis were earning laurels for their country in every field, including sports, from across the world, and the entire nation was proud of its heroes.

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan and China joint naval exercises which are underway in the North Arabian Sea, will be culminated mid-week as the move will boost cooperation, build a safe maritime environment and
 enhance the two navies' capability to deal with maritime terrorism and crime together.
 The nine-day exercise is taking place amid major developments in the region especially in neighbouring waters. The monitoring reports show extremely satisfying results.
 According to Chinese media reports the exercise, dubbed "Sea Guardians-2020," started in the port city of Karachi and being held in the North Arabian Sea until Tuesday, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Daily reported.
 The Chinese troops mainly come from the PLA Southern Theater Command Navy, including guided missile destroyer Yinchuan, guided missile frigate Yuncheng, comprehensive supplement ship Weishanhu, submarine rescue ship Liugongdao and two vessel-based helicopters.
 Pakistan will have two frigates, two missile boats, a fixed-wing anti- submarine aircraft and two vessel-based helicopters in the drills.
 They are conducting joint cruising, air defence, maritime interception, anti- submarine and live-fire shooting exercises at sea.
 The goal of the Sea Guardians-2020 drills is to boost the two countries' military cooperation, enhance their all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, build a safe maritime environment and enhance the two navies' capability to deal with maritime terrorism and crime together, the PLA Daily report said.
 This joint exercise is not related to regional affairs and is not aimed at any third party, the PLA Daily added.
 It is a part of the annual cooperation plan between the Pakistani and Chinese military forces, said Ren Guoqiang, a defence ministry spokesperson, at a routine press conference, when announcing the exercise.

ISLAMABAD: Keeping the Council of Islamic Ideology's (CII) religion-based conclusion in view, the sentences awarded to several accused persons including political figures for the offences now declared un-Islamic and keeping them in custody for months is also un-Islamic.
 Legal experts opine that the CII recommendations are not binding on the government and parliament to implement. The CII Chairman Dr Qibla Ayaz concurs with this view and says the CII only "advises" the government, parliament and provincial assemblies and it is for them to enforce its findings. The CII declared three clauses of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) un- Islamic. Section 14 pertains to burden of proof and presumption against accused accepting illegal gratification, Section 15 relates to disqualification to contest elections and hold public office and Section 26 covers tender of pardon (approver).
 The accountability courts convicted Nawaz Sharif in both the London apartments and Al-Azizia Steels Mills cases on the basis of presumption after concluding that he has failed to come clean on the allegations for having the burden of proof on his shoulders to establish that he is innocent. The 131-page verdict of the trial court in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills reference contained the word "presume" 10 times and the word "presumption" for 13 times. Judge Arshad Malik defended the use of presumption while quoting the law of evidence and previous judgments of the superior courts and even used illustrations to show instances where the court could presume.
 He held that the prosecution has successfully established all the ingredients of the offence of corruption and corrupt practices against the former prime minister. He ruled that as per the evidence read before him and documents referred, the prosecution has succeeded in establishing a reasonable case against the accused, who faced the burden of proof.
 The court used the illustrations mentioned in the law of evidence which stated that a man, who is in possession of stolen goods soon after the theft, is either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen unless he can account for his possession. In the London apartments' case, Judge Muhammad Bashir had also relied on presumption and sentenced Nawaz Sharif accordingly. On presumption-based evidence, the court first established that the ex-premier was the owner of the London properties and then punished him for failing to explain the sources with which he had purchased them.
 However, the judge acquitted Nawaz Sharif and others from the charge of having acquired these properties "by corrupt, dishonest, or illegal means". The accused was convicted for his failure to explain how he had purchased the London flats. However, while doing so, the judge instead of relying on concrete evidence, depended on presumptive or circumstantial evidence to conclude that Nawaz Sharif is the real owner of the London flats.
 The judge admitted in his verdict that establishing the ownership of the flats was difficult in the absence of relevant documents but made it clear that it is relying on prosecution's presumption that the accused is the owner of the properties.
 However, Nawaz Sharif's convictions in both the references also became questionable because of a ruling of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in one case and owing to the video scandal of Judge Arshad Malik in the other.
 In the London apartments case, a two-member IHC bench, while granting bail to Nawaz Sharif, Maryam and Captain (retd) Safdar, had found that the conviction and sentences handed down to them "may not be ultimately sustainable".
 The verdict said that the NAB was unable to prove the corruption charges and pointed out that though the prosecution had told the accountability court that Maryam was her father's dependent, its judgment did not refer to any evidence which would connect her to have aided, assisted or conspired with her father at the time when the apartments were said to have been acquired between 1993 and 1996.

WASHINGTON: The United States piled new sanctions on Iran's already crippled economy Friday and defended the killing of a top Iranian leader, saying he had been planning an "imminent" attack on US embassies.
 The sanctions, announced at the White House, marked the latest salvo in a US- Iranian confrontation that risked sliding into war a week ago with the deadly US drone attack on general Qasem Soleimani, who was by some measures the second most influential person in Iran.
 In response, Iran fired volleys of ballistic missiles at Iraqi bases housing US troops, without causing casualties. While President Donald Trump said he would not respond further militarily, Washington is intent on maintaining pressure.
 The sanctions mean "we will cut off billions of dollars of support to the Iranian regime," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the White House.
 The measures targeting Iran's steel industry and eight state officials came on top of massive sanctions already aimed at bringing the country's economy to its knees.
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that sanctions so far "have deprived the regime of billions in revenue."
 "Oil revenues (are) down by 80 percent and Iran cannot access roughly 90 percent of its foreign policy reserves," he said. "As long as Iran's outlaw ways continue we will continue to impose sanctions."
 Among the senior Iranian officials targeted in the new measures were Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Mohammad Reza Ashtiani, the Iranian armed forces deputy chief of staff and Gholamreza Soleimani, the head of the Basij militia, a volunteer force loyal to the regime.
 Seventeen Iranian metals producers and mining companies were listed. The sanctions also included a network of three entities that are based in China and the Seychelles as well as a vessel "involved in the purchase, sale, and transfer of Iranian metals products," the Treasury said in a statement.
 Critics are questioning why Trump -- who has been impeached and faces a Senate trial in the coming days -- ordered Soleimani's killing last week. US media reported Friday that the American military allegedly targeted an additional Iranian official, Abdul Reza Shahlai, who is a senior officer of Iran's elite Quds Force, in a top-secret mission on the same day in Yemen.
 Shahlai was not killed, but the reports beg further questions about whether Trump was indeed acting to prevent an additional attack by Soleimani or carrying out a broader campaign against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
 The administration has pushed back against accusations that Trump acted recklessly, insisting long-time US foe Soleimani was on the brink of launching an attack and had to be stopped. On Thursday, Trump said that Soleimani had been planning to blow up the US embassy in Baghdad. However, officials did not back up that scenario.
 Then on Friday, Trump shifted, saying "probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad."
 "I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies," Trump added in an interview.
 Earlier, Pompeo said the US had specific information on "imminent" attacks "against American facilities, including American embassies, military bases."
 But he added he did not know what day they were planned for. The United States has been at loggerheads with Iran for decades. Soon after Trump came into office he withdrew from an international accord meant to give Iran the ability to develop civilian nuclear power while under supervision. Trump claimed that Tehran was cheating and trying to obtain a nuclear weapon. At a re-election campaign rally in Ohio on Thursday, Trump referred to Soleimani as "the world's top terrorist." "He was a bloodthirsty terror and he's no longer a terror. He's dead."

 "It helps that I have been scoring runs in previous series in the last month. I had the confidence and I used my form well. Playing at No.3 or No.5 as an opener is a different challenge but I was ready for it. I wanted to enjoy it. Today it came off and a lot of credit goes to you guys and the start you guys gave and the way Virat (Kohli) kept going on," said Man of the Match KL Rahul.
 Rahul blasted 80 off just 52 balls, which included six fours and three sixes. Captain Virat Kohli too played a fine knock, scoring 78 off 76 balls as India posted an imposing total on board.
 Steve Smith scored a brilliant 98 and got support from Marnus Labuschagne, who scored 46 off 47 balls, but Australia were always behind the eight ball in the run-chase and eventually fell well short.
 Mohammed Shami took three wickets while Navdeep Saini, Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja took two wickets apiece. Jasprit Bumrah took one wicket but was the most economical bowler of the match, giving away just 32 runs off his 9.1 overs.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has received the maximum number of 61 schemes followed by Sindh 42, Punjab 17 and Islamabad just one. The schemes’ approval needs the Petroleum Division’s green light. Despite a stiff opposition by the Petroleum Division’s top bosses, the government has given the go-ahead for 121 gas development schemes to beef up the political clout in the constituencies of the PTI MPs.
 The Petroleum Division kept on saying in various meetings that the country faced a huge gas deficit but the government approved the schemes. However, no gas development scheme has been approved for Balochistan. The decision was taken in a steering committee meeting on Sustainable Development Goals Achievements Program (SAP) headed by Minister for Defense Pervaiz Khattak. The meeting was held on December 2, 2019 attended by federal ministers Shafqat Mehmood, Fehmida Mirza, Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar, Omar Ayub Khan, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Ali Mohammad Khan, and MNAs Aamer Mehmood Kiani, Aftab Hussain Siddiqui, Khan Muhammad Khan Jamali, Amer Dogar, and Aminul Haq. The Federal Minister for Planning Division Asad Umar attended the meeting as guest.
 An official source said 25,000,00 applications for gas connection were still pending with the Sui Northern, and if they were connected, about 150-200 MMCFD gas would also be consumed. The said schemes are subject to provision of certification by the Petroleum Division. However, the head of the steering committee on SAP has stepped up pressure on the Petroleum Division for issuing the required certification. In the follow-up meeting, the official said, Pervaiz Khattak got angry when the Petroleum Division opposed the decision taken in December 2 meeting and argued that the KP and Sindh have surplus gas and the government will complete the gas development schemes at any cost. “Balochistan also has surplus, but no gas schemes were approved for that province,” the official said.
 In the said meeting, Khattak said that in the provinces where gas was surplus for gas development schemes, there was no need for a certificate from the Petroleum Division. However, the Punjab is a province where gas deficit is on the higher side and for gas development scheme there, the Petroleum Division was required to give certificate. But representative from the Punjab objected to this observation of Khattak saying when the Punjab had surplus wheat it was not allowed to export the commodity, but first asked to cater to the food needs of the provinces where wheat was less produced.
 When contacted, Pervaiz Khattak said: “Yes, I asked the Petroleum Division officials that Sindh, Balochistan and KP are surplus in gas and therefore there is no need to have a certification from the Petroleum Division.” However, he insisted that the decision of 121 schemes had not finalised yet and all would be made as per law. He said people would be provided with gas through the development schemes.
 Asked if the development schemes were being initiated to beef up political clout in the PTI constituencies, he said the government took the decision to facilitate the masses. Asked why the government was launching new gas schemes when the country was facing gas deficit, he said Sindh, Balochistan and KP have surplus gas. However, he advised against printing and highlighting the news about the new gas development schemes. He said during the PML-N government, the cabinet committee had approved gas development schemes and now he headed the Steering Committee to approve the schemes.
 The Petroleum Division spokesman Ayub Chaudhary, Additional Secretary (P) said they were waiting for the minutes of the follow-up meeting of steering committee and after that Federal Minister for Energy Omar Ayub would be updated on the minutes and then a decision would be taken accordingly. However, he agreed that gas was not enough for more connections.
 According to minutes of the December 2 meeting available with The News, for Nowshera alone, Pervez Khattak managed to get approval for 40 gas development schemes. It is pertinent to mention that Nowshera is the constituency of Pervez Khattak. The steering Committee approved 19 development schemes for Malakand and two for Mardan to beef up the PTI political base in the two areas. In Sindh, the PTI has approved 42 gas development schemes only in Badin to appease its allies including Dr Fahmida Mirza and others in Badin but no gas scheme for any other part of Sindh was approved.
 For Punjab the Steering committee approved 17 schemes including three for Bahawalpur, two for Chakwal, five for Faisalabad, two each for Gujrat and Rahim Yar Khan, and one each of Rawalpindi, Sargodha and Islamabad.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has received the maximum number of 61 schemes followed by Sindh 42, Punjab 17 and Islamabad just one. The schemes’ approval needs the Petroleum Division’s green light.
 Despite a stiff opposition by the Petroleum Division’s top bosses, the government has given go-ahead for 121 gas development schemes to beef up the political clout in the constituencies of PTI MPs.
 The Petroleum Division kept on saying in various meetings that the country faced a huge gas deficit but the government approved the schemes.
 However, no gas development scheme has been approved for Balochistan.
 The decision was taken in a steering committee meeting on Sustainable Development Goals Achievements Program (SAP) headed by Minister for Defense schemes.
 The meeting was held on December 2, 2019 attended by federal ministers Shafqat Mehmood, Fehmida Mirza, Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar, Omar Ayub Khan, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Ali Mohammad Khan, and MNAs Aamer Mehmood Kiani, Aftab Hussain Siddiqui, Khan Muhammad Khan Jamali, Amer Dogar, and Aminul Haq. Federal Minister for Planning Division Asad Umar attended the meeting as guest.
 The said schemes are subject to provision of certification by the Petroleum Division.
 Official said 25,000,00 applications for gas connection were still pending with the Sui Northern, and if they were connected, about 150-200 MMCFD gas would also be consumed.
 However, the head of the steering Committee on SAP has stepped up pressure on the Petroleum Division for issuing the required certification.
 In the follow-up meeting, the official said, Pervaiz Khattak got angry when the Petroleum Division opposed the decision taken in December 2 meeting and argued that the KP and Sindh had surplus gas and the government will complete the gas development schemes at any cost.
 “Balochistan is also in surplus, but no gas schemes were approved for the province,” the official said.
 In the said meeting, Mr Khattak said that in the provinces where gas was surplus for gas development schemes, there was no need for a certificate from the Petroleum Division. However, the Punjab is a province where gas deficit is on the higher side and for gas development scheme there, the Petroleum Division was required to give certificate. But representative from the Punjab objected to this observation of Mr Khattak saying when the Punjab was in surplus of wheat it was not allowed to export wheat, but first asked to cater to food needs of the provinces where wheat was less produced.

Whew! We have hit the ground running in 2020. Literally.      Some break in the new year with a bang; others ease into their groove; either way, as long as you are moving.      The lower body is a target zone for many whether it is to tighten up and tone, build balance and endurance, or simply to increase strength. It's the whole lower half of our body so our options are plentiful.      Our move today is a close/wide stance, side to side squat. This move will be targeting inner and outer thighs, quads, and hamstring and build coordination also.      All you need is a good area to move around in. You can also add hand weights for extra resistance.      Begin this exercise by standing tall, holding your chest up, core engaged, and feet slightly wider than your hips.      Start by "sitting into" your squat. Go as low as you can efficiently hold this position, and step one leg out to a "wide stance" squat, quickly followed by bringing the other leg over to a close stance position, (again).      Now, return to your starting standing post, then immediately return to a squat. And this time, step out to the side with the opposite leg, into another wide stance, bringing the trail leg in close then stand again.      Continue this side to side move for at least 10 times in each direction.      Take a small break, then return for at least two more sets.      This move can be intensified by adding weight, and simplified by returning to a standing position after each squat motion.      And one of the best parts is this can double as cardio too!      Basically, this is a simple lower body move to add into your growing fitness plan for the new year.

As many as 176 passengers were on board from various countries who all perished as a result of this ‘human error’. The aerospace commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards accepted full responsibility for the shooting down of the Ukrainian passenger jet.
 Earlier, in a tweet, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said, “Armed Forces’ internal investigation has concluded that regrettably missiles fired due to human error caused the horrific crash of the Ukrainian plane & death of 176 innocent people.”
 From the Foreign Office, a response came from Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, “Iran’s confession of downing Ukrainian passenger plane should ease up tensions as the region can neither endure tension nor can it tolerate war anymore.”
 Qureshi spoke on the eve of his departure to Tehran which will be the first capital in Pakistan’s attempt to de-escalate tensions in the region which started with the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani by the United States. He added that the conflict between Iran and the United States should de-escalate and US President Donald Trump’s recent statement was a ray of hope in this regard.
 On Friday, the foreign minister had met with new Iranian ambassador to Pakistan Syed Mohammad Ali Hosseini, who reaffirmed that his government under no circumstances wants any escalation in the Middle East.
 A statement from the office of the foreign minister said that Pakistan would play an active role to reduce growing tensions in the region and he will hold meeting with the Iranian leadership in Tehran.
 "On Prime Minister Imran Khan’s instructions, I am going to visit Iran, and we plan on visiting Saudi Arabia and the United States of America shortly after," he said, adding that he hoped to meet with his Saudi counterpart as well.
 Later, the minister had a telephonic conversation with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu on the latest situation in the Middle East. Pakistan and Turkey are firming up fresh dates for the postponed visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Pakistan.

CANTON — What started as a request to county lawmakers by heads of the St. Lawrence County Department of Social Services to have a senior caseworker position filled led to a frank discussion about the increase in both foster homes and the children in their care.
 During Monday’s county Finance Committee meeting, DSS Commissioner Christopher R. Rediehs and Deputy Commissioner Heather L. Wenzel told legislators the senior caseworker position is important so the department can adequately supervise the caseworker assistants. “This senior caseworker position can provide the kind of coordination and oversight for this that will greatly enhance our ability to make sure that the visitations are taking place,” Mr. Rediehs told the board.
 The position was one of 12 countywide positions brought before the board as part of the county’s Vacancy Review Committee, but it was the senior caseworker position that started close to a 20-minute discussion about the necessity of the job.
 Legislative Chairman Joseph R. Lightfoot said the detailed justification for the job was “scant” and wondered if the position was really needed.
 “It seems to me, in looking at the justification for it, that it could probably be filled with a similar position that you probably already have on board,” Mr. Lightfoot said. “Can you give me some reason to believe that this isn’t a scant job description, that there is some overriding value to having this person and position on board?”
 Mr. Rediehs said his department has a challenge in child welfare cases with the volume of work it is faced with. Supervision of that work is essential and it’s important to have enough supervisors to do the work well, he said.
 “One of the aspects of this that we want to make sure you are aware of, this is not adding to our staff, this is really changing the totals and increasing the cost from the senior clerk by perhaps less than $3,000 in county cost in an effort to make sure that we have adequate supervision of the staff,” Mr. Rediehs said.
 Ms. Wenzel then laid out some of the statistics, telling the board that their Child Protective Services supervisors are supervising about 171 cases with six to eight caseworkers, with their preventive supervisors handling 70 cases with six to eight caseworkers. This creates a burdensome caseload, she said.
 “A lot of research has indicated that quality visitation allows children to go home more quickly and saves us money because children are in foster care for shorter periods of time,” Ms. Wenzel said. “What we are finding now is that moving them to a lower level of supervision more quickly so children can return home takes a lot of supervision.”
 And the number of children in foster care in St. Lawrence County continues to rise, she told Mr. Lightfoot and the legislators.
 “Right now we have about seven volunteers who work part-time and part of the reason we added the two homemaker/visitation/supervisor positions that you have allowed us to create is because we have over more than doubled the number of foster homes that we administer here, that DSS oversees,” she said. “So three years ago we had about 30 homes and now we have over 80 and over 100 children who are in the commission’s custody, who are in DSS foster homes, and so they need that supervised visitation. So that is part of the reason.”
 The role of the new position would help train new staff who have not worked in child welfare before.
 Ms. Wenzel said the department is hoping to make a slight move away from its volunteer program because of the small number of volunteers that have been with them for a while and move towards a “coached visitation model,” where staff provides families the assistance they need to improve their skills.
 “Having a group of staff who are together with a dedicated supervisor who can really assess these cases and move them forward will save us money in the end and we’ll be providing a better quality service to our families,” she said. “So one of our staff would work with them and they would supervise visits together until they are comfortable to be on their own.”
 Through ongoing mentorship and training, staff would meet with their supervisor once a week, talk about the issues the family is having, talk about situations that occur where they didn’t really know how to respond or what to do next and report back to the caseworker handling the case about what is going on with the family, Ms. Wenzel said.
 Legislator Rita E Curran said, having been a foster parent, she has noticed a lot more movement with children going from foster home to foster home.
 “It’s not the traditional ‘place this child here, this is where they stay and life works out,’ Ms. Curran said. “It seems like you have a lot more running around than you used to have and a lot more tracking.”
 Ms. Wenzel said moving around of children in foster care was also a statewide and national trend that is due to a myriad of reasons, including regulations regarding placement of siblings, keeping them in homes in their school districts, or children who are in special education programs who may be going to different districts other than their home district as well.
 “Absolutely, children having exceptional needs ... and when you have a pool of foster parents, sometimes you don’t have the perfect person, the person who doesn’t have other children in the home for example for a child who has higher needs, and so you may be placing children in that home that might not be the ideal placement because it’s the placement that is available at that time while you are looking for that ideal spot,” Ms. Wenzel said. “So there is a lot to think about. The canvassing that our homemakers do to try to make that perfect match, they work very hard at it.”
 After the meeting, legislator Nance A. Arquiett, in a statement to the Times, said she acknowledges that, moving into 2020, the county has to be mindful of additional expenses, however, “I do hope we will remember that by failing to fill critical positions in social services, or by looking to cut costs in this department we will only hurt those who are most in need of our assistance, those who are most vulnerable.”
 She said the number of children in foster care is on the rise and that now was the time for the county lawmakers to be “stepping up, making sure the needs of these children are being met and that we work our hardest to leave no child behind.”

Trust has clearly been broken within your marriage due to the affair; therefore, do all you can to rebuild it. Being consistent in both what you say and what you do is essential. Your spouse will be watching for inconsistency. Choose to show them in a way that’s not defensive that you are working at becoming trustworthy—moment-to-moment and choice-by-choice. Trust is never earned once and for all. This is an opportunity to show your spouse that you are serious in this commitment through continued choices every day. You are not trying to convince your spouse to trust you; you are trying to be trustworthy. When you try too hard to convince, sometimes you become _un_ trustworthy. For example, you might be tempted to hide certain information because you want your spouse to trust you. But the very act of concealing information is untrustworthy.

President Hassan Rouhani said a military probe into the tragedy had found “missiles fired due to human error” brought down the Boeing 737, calling it an “unforgivable mistake”. He said Iran had been on alert for possible US attacks after Soleimani’s “martyrdom”.
 “Iran is very much saddened by this catastrophic mistake and I, on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran, express my deep condolences to the families of victims of this painful catastrophe,” he said.
 Rouhani added he had ordered “all relevant bodies to take all necessary actions (to ensure) compensation” to the families of those killed.
 Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences and ordered the armed forces to address “shortcomings” so that such a disaster does not happen again.
 The acknowledgement came after officials in Iran had for days categorically denied Western claims that the Ukraine International Airlines plane had been struck by a missile in a catastrophic error.
 The jet, which had been bound for Kiev, slammed into a field shortly after taking off from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport before dawn on Wednesday.
 It came only hours after Iran launched a wave of missiles at bases hosting American forces in Iraq in response to the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike.
 The aerospace commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards accepted full responsibility.
 But Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh said the missile operator acted independently, shooting down the Boeing 737 after mistaking it for a “cruise missile”.
 The operator failed to obtain approval from his superiors because of disruptions to his communications system, he said.
 “He had 10 seconds to decide. He could have decided to strike or not to strike and under such circumstances he took the wrong decision.”
 “It was a short-range missile that exploded next to the plane,” Hajizadeh added.
 Iran had come under mounting international pressure to allow a “credible” investigation after video footage emerged appearing to show the plane being hit by a fast-moving object before a flash appears.
 Ukraine, Canada, Sweden and Afghanistan called for accountability after Iran’s admission.
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnston said Iran’s acknowledgement was an “important first step”.
 The military was first to admit the error, saying the aircraft had been mistaken for a “hostile target”.
 It said Iran had been at the highest level of alert after American “threats” and that the plane had turned and come close to a “sensitive” military site before it was hit due to “human error”.
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded Iran punish those responsible for the downing of the plane and pay compensation.
 “We expect Iran... to bring the guilty to the courts,” he said on Facebook, before his office announced he would speak later on the phone with Rouhani.
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau demanded “transparency, and justice for the families and loved ones of the victims”.
 “This is a national tragedy, and all Canadians are mourning together.”
 Sweden demanded a “complete and transparent probe” while Afghanistan said families of 13 of its citizens killed in the tragedy “deserve answers”.
 Iran has invited the United States, Ukraine, Canada and others to join the crash investigation.
 It is Iran’s worst civil aviation disaster since 1988 when the US military said it shot down an Iran Air plane over the Gulf by mistake, killing all 290 people on board.
 Video footage of Wednesday’s incident, which The New York Times said it had verified, appeared to show the moment the airliner was hit.
 A fast-moving object is seen rising at an angle into the sky before a bright flash appears, which dims and then continues moving forward. Several seconds later, an explosion is heard and the sky lights up.
 Many airlines from around the world cancelled flights to and from Iran in the wake of the crash, or rerouted flights away from Iranian airspace.
 Ukraine International Airlines Saturday said its plane had received no warning from Tehran airport about a possible threat to its safety before it took off en route for Kiev.
 At a briefing by its president and vice president, the airline also denied the aircraft veered off its normal course after an Iranian military statement said the plane flew close to a sensitive military site of the elite Revolutionary Guards.
 The airline officials bristled at what they said were hints from Iran that the crew had not acted properly.
 The airline officials called on Iran to take full responsibility for the crash and said the Iranian authorities should have closed the airport.
 “If you play at war, you play as much as you want, but there are normal people around who you had to protect,” Vice President Ihor Sosnovsky said.
 “If they are shooting from somewhere to somewhere, they were obliged to close the airport. Obliged. And then shoot as much as you want.”
 He added that the plane had turned 15 degrees to the right after it had reached 6,000 feet, in accordance with the instructions of the airport dispatcher.
 Eleven Ukrainians, including nine crew, died in the crash, according to Ukrainian government figures.
 Yevhenii Dykhne, the president and chief executive of the airline, made an emotional opening statement to reporters saying the airline had not done anything wrong in terms of following security procedures.
 “At the time of departure from (Kiev’s) Boryspil airport, the airline had no information about possible threats,” he said. “At the time of departure from Tehran airport, it was exactly the same.”
 The airline said Tehran airport was operating normally at the time its aircraft took off. Asked why there had been a delay in take-off, Dykhne said the captain had decided to offload some luggage because the plane was too heavily loaded.

The sanctions, announced at the White House, marked the latest salvo in a US- Iranian confrontation that risked sliding into war a week ago with the deadly US drone attack on general Qasem Soleimani, who was by some measures the second most influential person in Iran.
 In response, Iran fired volleys of ballistic missiles at Iraqi bases housing US troops, without causing casualties. While President Donald Trump said he would not respond further militarily, Washington is intent on maintaining pressure.
 The sanctions mean "we will cut off billions of dollars of support to the Iranian regime," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the White House.
 The measures targeting Iran´s steel industry and eight state officials came on top of massive sanctions already aimed at bringing the country´s economy to its knees.
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that sanctions so far "have deprived the regime of billions in revenue."
 "Oil revenues (are) down by 80 percent and Iran cannot access roughly 90 percent of its foreign policy reserves," he said. "As long as Iran’s outlaw ways continue we will continue to impose sanctions."
 Among the senior Iranian officials targeted in the new measures were Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran´s Supreme National Security Council, Mohammad Reza Ashtiani, the Iranian armed forces deputy chief of staff and Gholamreza Soleimani, the head of the Basij militia, a volunteer force loyal to the regime.
 Seventeen Iranian metals producers and mining companies were listed. The sanctions also included a network of three entities that are based in China and the Seychelles as well as a vessel "involved in the purchase, sale, and transfer of Iranian metals products," the Treasury said in a statement.
 Critics are questioning why Trump -- who has been impeached and faces a Senate trial in the coming days -- ordered Soleimani´s killing last week. US media reported Friday that the American military allegedly targeted an additional Iranian official, Abdul Reza Shahlai, who is a senior officer of Iran´s elite Quds Force, in a top-secret mission on the same day in Yemen.
 Shahlai was not killed, but the reports beg further questions about whether Trump was indeed acting to prevent an additional attack by Soleimani or carrying out a broader campaign against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
 The administration has pushed back against accusations that Trump acted recklessly, insisting long-time US foe Soleimani was on the brink of launching an attack and had to be stopped. On Thursday, Trump said that Soleimani had been planning to blow up the US embassy in Baghdad. However, officials did not back up that scenario.
 Then on Friday, Trump shifted, saying "probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad."
 "I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies," Trump added in an interview.
 Earlier, Pompeo said the US had specific information on "imminent" attacks "against American facilities, including American embassies, military bases."
 But he added he did not know what day they were planned for. The United States has been at loggerheads with Iran for decades. Soon after Trump came into office he withdrew from an international accord meant to give Iran the ability to develop civilian nuclear power while under supervision. Trump claimed that Tehran was cheating and trying to obtain a nuclear weapon. At a re-election campaign rally in Ohio on Thursday, Trump referred to Soleimani as "the world´s top terrorist."
 "He was a bloodthirsty terror and he´s no longer a terror. He´s dead."

He passed the ball to Liptak, who passed it back. Snead saw an opening and dribbled inside, trying to make a move with three opposing Dukes collapsing in on him.
 As he was going up, he drew the foul….and the cheers from the home crowd.
 The Goochland senior went to the free-throw line.
 Four-tenths of a second remained on the game clock, and Snead’s Bulldogs were still tied at 62-all with James River District rival Cumberland. But Snead now had the opportunity to shoot two free-throws and get his team the lead.
 “A lot of things were going through my head,” Snead said. “I knew I had to step up as a leader and hit the free-throw.”
 He made his first shot.
 And while the second didn’t go through, and the clock was reset to 0.2 seconds – therefore giving Cumberland one very last chance to try and make something happen – Snead delivered again, this time reaching up to block the Dukes’ long-travelling inbounding throw to seal-up the thrilling 63-62 triumph for the Bulldogs.
 “We’ve got a lot of grit we played with – and heart,” Goochland head coach Preston Gordon said after the game. “They expend so much energy in a situation like we had tonight. I’m really proud of them. They work really hard.”
 Snead finished his night with 15 points, 4 assists and 3 steals.
 “Quincy’s been a 4-year starter for us…he gives everything he has and I wish we had more players that…would give their body up and just let out everything, every ounce of energy, they have every single time like he does,” Gordon said.
 Junior Kameron Holman unleashed a big night all over the floor, complementing a team-leading 21 points with 6 steals and 5 rebounds.
 “He’s one that doesn’t get too high and he doesn’t get too low; he’s a pretty mellow player – and he’s so explosive when he gets to the rim,” Gordon said of Holman. “He’s a fun player to watch. He’s a fun player to coach.”
 Sophomore J.B. Bell double-doubled with 15 and 13 rebounds. He also hit the game-tying shot in the closing moments of the fourth quarter, right after Goochland had called the timeout.
 “Our guys executed the play to the max – perfect, good layup,” Gordon said, “and I think that speaks volumes when you’ve got two seniors on the floor, two juniors and a sophomore, and you go to the sophomore for the game-tying shot…we’ve had Quincy hit huge shots for us, Walker [Murray]’s hit a huge shot…that’s what’s so special about this team. They trust each other…and they’re confident in each other.”
 Kayshawn Smith also scored 8 points with a pair of momentum-swinging 3-pointers across the middle portion of the game.
 Goochland came into Friday’s game with eight players dressed-out, and all eight, including the three who were called up for the game from JV – Liptak, De’Andre Robinson and JD Mills – took the floor Friday night.

"So far 12 bodies have been recovered. The search and rescue operation continues," they said in a statement, adding that they had rescued more than 20 survivors.
 "Three of them are being flown by helicopter to (the nearest hospital) for emergency treatment," the statement added. There were no immediate details on the identity of those on board.
 The boat, which was carrying around 50 people, took on water near the island of Paxi during an apparent attempt to reach Italy.
 At this point someone on board issued a distress call, the authorities said.
 Six coastguard patrol boats and three helicopters were engaged in the continuing rescue effort, authorities said.
 Four passing cargo ships were also assisting the operation, the coastguard said.
 Thousands of migrants and refugees have died in recent years while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea in small, overloaded boats.
 With Greece’s northern borders closed to migrants seeking to reach western Europe, some are trying clandestine routes to quit the country, such as mountain routes into Albania or by sailing to neighbouring Italy.
 Twenty-two people have died or are still missing in migrant boat sinkings in the Mediterranean just this month, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Another 73 persons were rescued in separate incidents in the Aegean between Friday and Saturday, the Greek coastguard added. Greece in 2019 again became the main entry into Europe for migrants and refugees. The UN refugee agency recorded more than 55,000 arrivals by sea, and more than 14,000 via the land border with Turkey.
 Greece’s new conservative government has struggled to manage hundreds of new asylum-seeker arrivals on a daily basis from the coast of neighbouring Turkey.

WASHINGTON: The United States piled new sanctions on Iran´s already crippled economy Friday and defended the killing of a top Iranian leader, saying he had been planning an "imminent" attack on US embassies.
 The sanctions, announced at the White House, marked the latest salvo in a US- Iranian confrontation that risked sliding into war a week ago with the deadly US drone attack on general Qasem Soleimani, who was by some measures the second most influential person in Iran.
 In response, Iran fired volleys of ballistic missiles at Iraqi bases housing US troops, without causing casualties. While President Donald Trump said he would not respond further militarily, Washington is intent on maintaining pressure.
 The sanctions mean "we will cut off billions of dollars of support to the Iranian regime," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the White House.
 The measures targeting Iran´s steel industry and eight state officials came on top of massive sanctions already aimed at bringing the country´s economy to its knees.
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that sanctions so far "have deprived the regime of billions in revenue."
 "Oil revenues (are) down by 80 percent and Iran cannot access roughly 90 percent of its foreign policy reserves," he said. "As long as Iran's outlaw ways continue we will continue to impose sanctions."
 Among the senior Iranian officials targeted in the new measures were Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran´s Supreme National Security Council, Mohammad Reza Ashtiani, the Iranian armed forces deputy chief of staff and Gholamreza Soleimani, the head of the Basij militia, a volunteer force loyal to the regime.
 Seventeen Iranian metals producers and mining companies were listed. The sanctions also included a network of three entities that are based in China and the Seychelles as well as a vessel "involved in the purchase, sale, and transfer of Iranian metals products," the Treasury said in a statement.
 Critics are questioning why Trump -- who has been impeached and faces a Senate trial in the coming days -- ordered Soleimani´s killing last week. US media reported Friday that the American military allegedly targeted an additional Iranian official, Abdul Reza Shahlai, who is a senior officer of Iran´s elite Quds Force, in a top-secret mission on the same day in Yemen.

A scary Russian Soyuz launch in 2018 highlighted the importance of in-flight escape systems. The Soyuz system worked as designed and a NASA astronaut and Roscosmos cosmonaut returned safely to Earth after a mid-air rocket failure.
 SpaceX successfully sent an uncrewed Crew Dragon to the ISS in early 2019. The ultimate goal is to make a return trip with NASA astronauts on board. If the in-flight abort test works out, then the first launch of humans from US soil since the end of the space shuttle era should finally happen in 2020.
