Australia's Qantas announced Monday that it's on board with requiring a "vaccination passport" for international travelers, starting next year. "We are looking at changing our terms and conditions to say for international travelers, that we will ask people to have the vaccination before they get on the aircraft," Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Australia's Network 9. Korean Air and Air New Zealand also backed the idea but said any changes would have to be coordinated with their respective governments.

Prendere il polpo pulito e cuocerlo in acqua bollente con un pizzico di sale a fuoco molto basso, per circa 30 minuti fino a quando non diventa tenero. Una volta tenero, lasciar raffreddare, spellare e poi tagliare in pezzi. Nel mentre lessare le patate, poi sbucciarle e tagliarle a cubi. Metterle poi in un’insalatiera e versare un po' di vino bianco. Il vino serve a non far assorbire troppo olio alle patate. Poi unire il polpo, aggiungete sale se necessita e pepe, cospargere con rosmarino e infine condire con olio. Una volta fatto il fantastico piatto unico è pronto per essere servito a tavola.

A branding fundamental is authenticity built on a foundation of performance and delivery. If you don't believe in your own goods and services, then no one will. Regardless of how good the facade is, your customers will eventually see through it. Therefore, the fundamental factor is having a product or service that really delivers so you can be authentic in promoting the brand.

U.S. airlines are adding flights, and in some cases COVID-19 testing programs, for travel to Mexico and the Caribbean, a region central to carriers' strategies to tap into pockets of holiday demand before a vaccine makes its way around the world. Beachside resort destinations in areas like Cancun are the only spots that now have more flights from U.S. cities scheduled for November and December than last year, numbers from aviation data firm Cirium show. Overall, U.S. airlines are flying about 50% less than 2019, with flights to traditional European vacation hotspots like Paris down by as much as 82% due to travel bans and quarantines. While new revenue streams from destinations like the Caribbean will help, they won't be enough to put airlines in the black for the year, analysts have said. The holiday period is traditionally when airlines thrive ahead of slow months in January and February. But this year they have said they will continue to burn millions of dollars daily through the fourth quarter as they wrestle with slashed demand. Ahead of Thanksgiving, U.S. airports saw their busiest weekend since mid- March, even after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urged Americans not to travel amid a spike in COVID-19 cases. Still, demand is down by around 60% and airlines say it's too soon to know how Christmas travel will play out. Still, airlines are hoping to build up a base of customers who feel comfortable about flying before a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widely available, eyeing the typically lucrative summer travel season.

SMITHVILLE — The Smithville football team looked perfect on the scoreboard of its latest dominant win as the Warriors beat Grandview 38-0 to advance to the state semifinals.
 Smithville head coach Jason Ambroson knew long before the final whistle that his team was far from perfect. In fact, he already had a solid list of miscues to work on this week before he had even looked at the game tape.
 But Ambroson also was not in a hurry for his players, his assistant coaches or himself to turn the page and tighten things for the Warriors matchup with Helias Catholic Friday, Nov. 27 at Smithville High School.
 Ambroson said that he made a promise to himself years ago that he wouldn’t get caught up in what’s next. He said he’s learned in his 27 years of coaching that these moments do not come around often, even if his teams have won eight or more games in each of his first six years at Smithville.
 “I’ve been doing this for a long time, and I think they’re more special every year,” Ambroson said. “When you get to be my age, you’re starting to look at there’s a lot (fewer) years coming up than there was before.”
 His age has not shown in the energy he brings to the sideline, constantly engaged in conversation with players and referees. He’s even started instructing scoreboard operators now that reduced crowd size during the pandemic has limited the roar of the crowd.
 Ambroson commands the attention of his players and his sage advice may be more handy this year than in years past.
 The Warriors have put together a 10-2 record this season despite the roster looking a lot different from the 9-2 squad that was bounced by Platte County in the district finals in 2019.
 The Miller twin combo with Spencer at quarterback and Isaac at running back had graduated along with leading receiver George Fisher.
 Ambroson turned to some fresh faces who had limited varsity experience or none at all.
 Junior running back Hayden Sigg had the most experience as an offensive weapon, but he was still recovering from an offseason surgery as this year got underway.
 The Warriors went out in the opener with sophomore Andrew Hedgecorth at quarterback, slinging the ball around the field to a trio of juniors in Rhett Foster, Keltin Nitsche and Samuel Calvert. He handed the ball off to sophomore Caleb Donnell.
 Smithville lost the home opener to Grain Valley 34-24, but not before they saw Hedgecorth make big plays as he started to find a rhythm en route to a 263-yard performance with three passing touchdowns.
 The Warriors never really slowed down from there, particularly after Sigg returned in the third game. Hedgecorth has built up an impressive resume with 2184 passing yards and 23 passing touchdowns with just five interceptions of the course of 12 games.
 Smithville maintains a balanced offensive attack just as Ambroson had hoped for since the beginning of the year. Sigg is just two yards shy of 1000 rush yards on 5.2 yards per carry while scoring 14 rushing touchdowns.
 The team has even cycled in other threats in the rushing and passing game. Sophomore Preston Rash has taken most of the second-string back carries as Donnell stays focused on his role as a starting cornerback.
 Two other players who have been key starters on defense have also started coming up big in the passing game.
 Junior Cody Simoncic, who moved around between linebacker and safety while being a playmaker at both, has started to come up big as a wide receiver as has sophomore Dawson Strickland.
 The biggest pattern is that the players are all underclassmen and other than Sigg and Simoncic, they had not had a whole lot of varsity experience before this season.
 Ambroson will not deny the fact he’s excited about getting to coach all those guys again next year, but he’s quick to point out that each season is independent and a lot of things could change between now and next fall. The COVID-19 pandemic that nearly took away this football season is further evidence of that.
 “We got to handle today,” Ambroson said. “We’re going to work on doing the best that we can do today. We’re going to continue that way and if that takes us to great things, then great. But nothing is given and we’re just thankful and happy that we have today.”
 His players have avoided looking ahead as well, but a few have admitted to giving it some thought.
 “I think we can continue on the path that we started this year,” junior lineman and occasional goal-line fullback Mason Crim said. “With every game we’re slowly getting better with more experience and I think we can continue that into next year.”
 Hedgecorth said he had not really thought about until he was asked. He liked the idea of starting next season with their foot on the gas instead of spending the first half of the season gaining chemistry the way they did this season.
 “At the beginning we were kind of figuring it out and then it started to click for us,” Hedgecorth said. “It should be really fun to go out there and play another year with all the same people and hopefully go win another one if we can (finish with a state title this year).”
 It’s rare to hear a first-year sophomore signal-caller talk about the aspirations of multiple state titles.
 Few have played like Hedgecorth has, resembling more of a savvy gunslinger than a game manager for this high-powered offense.
 “I’ve seen some kids at a sophomore level play very well,” Ambroson said. “I haven’t seen them play the way he’s played this year. I’m proud of him and I wouldn’t trade him for all the money in the world.”
 Now Hedgecorth and this youth movement will need two more wins to complete the dream season before they ever get started thinking about the great things they could do in the future.

Why a negative COVID test doesn't give you the green light for Thanksgiving


--DocBreak--
The children and their families may be having a different holiday too. The older daughter and her family have a camping trip planned for the the week the granddaughter is out of school. They’ve had to cancel vacations because of the corona virus. The younger daughter’s baby is due the end of November or first of December so traveling to Arkansas is out of the question. So here the Old Couple is planning a quiet reflective Thanksgiving.
 They have much to be thankful for, though. They could count the blessings all day and not make a dent in all the good things of their lives. This 2020 they definitely are thankful the Plague hadn’t darkened their door. They still have God’s true Word, the Holy Bible full of promises to give them hope. God had supplied angels to watch over their property. Their small town hadn’t had looters or rioters. Their church was still being attended even though the crowds were smaller. Online services were available for the compromised older members. They were free to worship and pray.
 As for me, not having kids and pets provided a serene day although I do miss a good chase around the house and the pitter-patter of little ones. The Old Woman likes to remind me of past holidays along with some mess-ups with recipes, snow appearing early, and a year she had the flu. But most memories included the stool bring scooted up to the cabinet, and the granddaughter helping roll out bread dough and forming knots and original forms of rolls. Of course, there was a favorite recipe for each family member which added several desserts and casseroles. After the meal games were pulled out and competition began – then some adults crashed for a nap.

In Pennsylvania, if you're having friends over to socialize, you're supposed to wear a mask — and so are your friends. That's the rule, but Barb Chestnut has no intention of following it.
 "No one is going to tell me what I can or not do in my own home" said Chestnut, 60, of Shippensburg. "They do not pay my bills and they are not going to tell me what to do."
 As governors and mayors grapple with an out-of-control pandemic, they are ratcheting up mask mandates and imposing restrictions on small indoor gatherings, which have been blamed for accelerating the spread of the coronavirus. But while such measures carry the weight of law, they are, in practical terms, unenforceable, and officials are banking on voluntary compliance instead.
 Good luck with that.
 While many are undoubtedly heeding public health advice — downsizing Thanksgiving plans, avoiding get-togethers, wearing masks when they're around people who don't live with them — it's inevitable that a segment of the population will blow off new state and local restrictions and socialize anyway. Experts say that could put greater stress on overburdened hospitals and lead to an even bigger spike in sickness and death over the holidays.
 "When this started in early March, we weren't staring at Thanksgiving and Christmas, and we didn't have the disease reservoir that we have. And that, to me, is the biggest concern in the next few weeks," said Dr. David Rubin, the director of PolicyLab at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He called the risk of a Thanksgiving spike "extremely high."
 "I think you're seeing a lot of resistance here," Rubin said. "I can't speculate on what people are going to do, but I can say that to the degree that there isn't a collective buy-in here, it sort of blunts the impact of the measures themselves."
 The nation is averaging 165,000 new virus cases per day, up over 70 percent in two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University. Hospitalizations, deaths and the testing positivity rate are also up sharply as the nation approaches Thanksgiving.
 In response, elected officials are imposing restrictions that, with some exceptions, fall short of the broad-based stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns seen in the spring.
 Utah and Vermont have banned all social gatherings. So have local governments in Philadelphia and Dane County, Wisconsin. In Kentucky, no more than eight people from two households are permitted to get together; in Oregon, the gathering limit is six. California has imposed an overnight curfew. More states are requiring masks, including those with GOP governors who have long resisted them. The nation's top health officials are urging Americans to avoid Thanksgiving travel.
 There's some evidence the holiday will be quieter.
 Tamika Hickson, who co-owns a party rental business in Philadelphia, said Thanksgiving was a bust even before her city moved to prohibit indoor gatherings of any size.
 "Nobody's calling," Hickson said. "A lot of people lost a lot of loved ones, so they're not playing with this. And I don't blame them."
 AAA projects Thanksgiving travel will fall by at least 10 percent, which would be the steepest one-year plunge since the Great Recession in 2008. But that still means tens of millions of people on the road. On social media, people defiantly talk about their Thanksgiving plans, arguing that nothing will stop them from seeing friends and family.
 More than 1 million people flocked to U.S. airports on Sunday, according to the Transportation Security Administration — the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic.
 Dr. Debra Bogen, the health director for Allegheny County, Penn., which includes Pittsburgh, said that too many have been ignoring public health guidance and that the result has been unchecked spread of the virus.
 "For the past few weeks, I've asked people to follow the rules, curtail gatherings and parties, stay home except for essentials, and wear masks. I'm done asking," Bogen said at a news conference, her frustration palpable. She announced a stay-at-home advisory that she said would turn into an order if people didn't comply.
 Some people are underestimating the risk to themselves and their friends and families, said Baruch Fischhoff, a Carnegie Mellon University psychologist who has written about COVID-19 risk analysis and communications. Others doubt what health officials are telling them about the virus. And still others are simply irresponsible.
 Fischhoff said the lack of a cohesive national pandemic strategy; patchwork and seemingly arbitrary restrictions at the state and local level; and ineffective, politicized and contradictory public health messaging have sown confusion and mistrust.
 "It has been a colossal, tragic failure of leadership from the very beginning that we didn't find the common ground in which we were working to protect the weakest among us. And once you've lost that coordination, you're scrambling to get it back and that's the tragic mess that we're in now," he said.
 In York County, Pennsylvania, 51-year-old retail worker Kori Jess tested positive for the virus last week. Long a mask skeptic, her personal experience with COVID-19 has changed her opinion — to a point. She said it's appropriate to wear a mask when circumstances warrant, but she still doesn't like the idea of government mandating them.
 "I'm so torn," Jess said. "I like that people are fighting for their freedoms, but I understand why people are wearing masks."
 In upstate New York, some sheriffs say they have no intention of enforcing Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo's recent mandate barring private gatherings of more than 10 people.
 "There is no need to hide cars and sneak around during your attempt to gather with family. We are not going to exhaust our limited resources obtaining search warrants and counting the turkey eaters in your house," Madison County Sheriff Todd Hood said in a Facebook post. He encouraged people in the largely rural area to use common sense to keep themselves safe.
 Kim Collins is among those planning a slimmed-down Thanksgiving. In a typical year, Collins would have as many as 20 people at her home in South Orange, New Jersey. This year, her extended family is staying put. "My husband's having a hard time with the fact that his mom, who's on her own, won't be here," she said.
 But Collins wasn't optimistic that others would be so careful. She said plenty of people are going through "mental gymnastics" to justify their holiday get- togethers. "I think that a lot of people aren't great at the honor system," she said.

Democrats felt confident that a blue wave was coming, expecting that they would win the presidency, expand their House majority and perhaps win control of the Senate.
 But that didn’t happen. Instead, Republicans increased their numbers in the House, flipping possibly a dozen seats from blue to red, and leaving the Democrats with a very slim majority.
 While the Democrats gained a seat in the Senate, Republicans may possibly retain their majority, depending upon the run-off elections for two Georgia seats.
 Despite the losses in the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Cal., claimed victory, touting the popular vote tally showing House Democrats collected more votes than Republicans. Apparently, the number of votes for Democrats is more important than the number of Democrats that will be in the House.
 Perhaps the most interesting, or the strangest, issue is the alleged massive fraud by voting machines manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems based in Canada. The Dominion machines are alleged to have actually thrown the election to Biden/Harris through manipulative software.
 It is a complicated scenario that many people have discounted because of a lack of evidence having been revealed to support it. However, supporters say there is plenty of evidence, adding that evidence is critical and necessary for legal proceedings, but is not needed merely to assuage doubting reporters and Trump opponents. The Trump legal team cites dozens of sworn affidavits, filed under the threat of perjury, alleging vote fraud in some states.
 Dominion has denied all charges, and its officials had agreed to testify before a Pennsylvania legislative committee. Then, Dominion strangely canceled out the night before the hearing.
 These days computers are capable of doing fantastic things. But can they control the votes of tens of millions of voters in hundreds of different voting locations?
 Georgia’s experience with Dominion computers used in the state’s primary raised questions and concerns over the company’s voting system. But Georgia stuck with them.
 And the head of another computer voting system, Smartmatic, admitted in 2017 that his company’s computers and software created at least one million additional votes in the Venezuelan election.
 Most view Trump’s efforts to prove he won as improbable. But with the vast array of problems and potential fraud, taking a few weeks to investigate them is not asking too much.

The GDP contraction will improve to higher single digits in the September quarter, and the economy will be back to positive growth by the March quarter, Nilesh Shah, a part-time member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, said on Tuesday. Shah, a mutual fund industry veteran, said markets are bound to head north in the long term and foreign portfolio investors who have already poured over Rs 45,000 crore into Indian markets in November, will pump more money in single month than in two previous years. The GDP contracted by 23.9 per cent in the June quarter due to strong lockdown measures and leading to expectations of the GDP growth being a negative 14 per cent for the full fiscal. However, resumption of economic activities lately has resulted in some revisions. The RBI expects Indias GDP to contract by 9.5 per cent. June quarter when we reported a 23.9 per cent drop, it was one of the worst ever. In the September quarter, the expectation is negative GDP growth but hopefully higher single-digit rather than double digit, December quarter will have lower single digit drop in GDP growth and March 21 quarter we should expect positive GDP growth, Shah said. Speaking at an event organised by BBF India, Shah said a lot depends on the second wave of infections, medical solutions like preventive vaccines or drugs which can cure the infections. From a longer term perspective, India needs to copy the Chinese model and be a manufacturer for the world to help its economy, he said. Shah said both India and China were at the same level in 1980, but China became the manufacturer of the world leading to massive gains while India remained the backoffice of the world. If we become part of the global supply chain, that will change indias growth orbit forever, he said, citing the case of South Korean electronics major Samsung. He said while Samsung also manufactures mobile phones and other items in India, it uses Vietnam more for supplying to the global markets. Resultantly, its turnover in India is only USD 12 billion, while in Vietnam, whose economy is a tenth of Indias, the same is over USD 60 billion. India needs to ensure that talent like Microsofts Satya Nadella and Googles Sundar Pichai does not venture out and create an enabling environment which will make it possible to build admired businesses, he said. At present, the condition of an entrepreneur is like that of Abhimanyu in the mythological book Mahabharat, who is fighting the market forces in the form of Kauravas and internal difficulties through the regulatory agencies watch, he said

Keeping towels, rags and other combustible items away from the cooking space.
 • Covering a pan with a lid if it catches on fire and then turning the burner off, and keeping a fire extinguisher in the kitchen since pouring water on a grease fire can actually make it worse.
 • Keeping pot handles turned inward to reduce the chances of an accident happening — and to keep kids from grabbing the handles
 • Using only fireplaces and space heaters to heat a home or outdoor area — and never using a cooking stove for that purpose
 • Not wearing loose clothing while cooking because the loose clothing could potentially come in contact with a burner and catch fire. It is recommended to wear only tight fitting sleeves.
 • Remembering to "Stop, Drop and Roll" if clothing catches on fire.
