We were able to evenly cook a pork roast in our testing. The only thing we noticed was the probe temperature was about 20°F higher than our own sensor, which could be caused by the probe’s exposure to the hot air within the oven, as our meat sensor was mostly embedded in cold pork and the probe was half- exposed. Finally, we made a pizza with guidance from the probe temperature and the pizza came out well-done and nearly burnt, which is what exactly we'd look for in a pizza crust. Our tester said the oven reached 200°F faster than she thought it would.

Bloomberg Opinion) -- The idea that Switzerland’s biggest banks could merge into a $76 billion behemoth sounds like the dream of a soon-to-retire chairman seeking to leave a historic legacy. Surely there is no way that Switzerland would welcome UBS Group AG buying arch-rival Credit Suisse Group AG.
 A combination would have $1.9 trillion of assets, more than twice the country’s annual GDP, and be far too dominant in its home market. After UBS’s bailout in the financial crisis, taxpayers would surely fret at the creation of a bigger, more complex bank. Yet, on paper, the strategic and financial logic is too appealing to ignore.
 UBS Chairman Axel Weber and his counterpart Urs Rohner at Credit Suisse are talking about a tie-up that would help the merged bank compete better against U.S. and Asian rivals, Inside Paradeplatz reported on Monday. Weber would stay on beyond his expected departure in 2022 while Credit Suisse Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein would retain his role, the report said. That would place UBS’s incoming CEO Ralph Hamers in a rather awkward position, and Weber would be the chief architect on the project.
 Neither firm has commented. Weber has been exploring the idea in the regular course of exploring strategic options, Bloomberg News reported.
 Dismissing this challenging transaction outright would be a mistake. True, UBS is already the world’s biggest wealth manager. But combining with its smaller competitor would see it pull further away from the pack in terms of scale and the efficiency that brings. Technology investment will only get more expensive. From back-office to research to compliance, the scope to eliminate duplicate expenses is enormous.
 UBS has struggled to cut costs without a deal, with departing CEO Sergio Ermotti repeatedly missing targets. A merger could lead to as much as 13% of the workforce leaving, or 15,000 or more worldwide, according to the Inside Paradeplatz report.
 The combined firm would get closer to having the full-service investment- banking offering that neither UBS nor Credit Suisse has on their own. A leader in equities, UBS, would marry a top player in credit markets. After shrinking in the aftermath of the financial crisis, UBS did away with much of its fixed- income business which Credit Suisse would complete. Likewise, Credit Suisse would strengthen UBS’s M&A and capital markets teams in the U.S.
 In asset management, scale would help the firms compete against passive rivals. And while Credit Suisse has grown rapidly in wealth recent years, client overlap should be manageable. Customers tend to diversify by placing funds with a U.S. and a Swiss firm. So “UBS-Credit Suisse” would probably be able to retain a considerable part of its combined footprint.
 Yet for all these attractions, Swiss regulators and policymakers face some tough calls. The banks’ control of 30% of the mortgage market is a clear antitrust problem. Politically, the domestic job cuts could be brutal, and all the more painful in a pandemic.
 And ultimately, even if the numbers were to stack up, Switzerland would need to be convinced that it’s better to have one large bank that’s more profitable and competitive than two smaller ones that are overshadowed by Wall Street peers. At least the risky securities business could be relatively smaller in the new firm.
 Europe arguably needs a handful of stronger, global banks. Industrial rationale in this case may not triumph, and the prospect of a complex integration may put both parties off. But regulators, executives and shareholders should at least ask whether the time has now come for this transformational deal.

These are commitments which were made in the withdrawal agreement, which the government now wants to change.
 It's also possible that there could be more changes to come. The upcoming finance bill may allow ministers to decide unilaterally which goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are "at risk" of being exported to the EU and should therefore have tariffs, or taxes on imports, imposed on them.
 That too would breach the agreement made with the EU.
 The government says it is all about having a fallback position if the EU refuses to talk sensibly about trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
 And there are some fairly fundamental principles at stake - for the UK protecting the union, and for the EU protecting the single market.
 But another way to look at this is that both sides are taking a tough approach as post-Brexit trade talks come to a head. And that shouldn't really surprise anyone.

The mobile operator Tracfone isn't exactly a household name, but it does have about 21 million customers in the US. Soon, those customers will fall under the Verizon umbrella, as Verizon just announced it is purchasing Tracfone from its owner America Movil. (Disclosure, Verizon is Engadget's parent company.)Tracfone has long operated as an MVNO in the US, leasing wireless spectrum from some of the biggest mobile carriers in the country, including Verizon, AT&T; and T-Mobile. It also operates under a host of brands, including Straight Talk and Walmart Family Mobile, and it has a large retailer footprint of over 90,000 locations at stores like CVS, Target and Best Buy. That said, it's not clear how Tracfone will operate once the Verizon deal is finished. But there's plenty of time to find out, as Verizon says it doesn't expect the sale to be finalized until the second half of 2021. This isn't the only MVNO to change hands this year -- as a result of the T-Mobile \/ Sprint merger, T-Mobile had to rid itself of Sprint's Boost Mobile brand. Dish picked it up at the beginning of July for $1.4 billion. By comparison, Verizon is paying $3.125 billion in cash and the same amount in Verizon stock for Tracfone.

Well, it would seem that the _Fast and Furious_ franchise has been planning to take on a more lunar motif for quite some time now.

The _Fast and Furious_ franchise has come a long way since it first began in 2001. The first installment gave audiences tricked out cars and exciting street races. However, in the years that have followed, the films have opted for set pieces and stunts that are a bit more elaborate. This includes a pair of cars dragging a massive safe around a city and an armored tank travelling across an ice lake. Even the spinoff, _Hobbs & Shaw_, introduced the concept of superhumans to the franchise.

LONDON (AP) — Developing countries' difficulty in containing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic will keep a lid on global oil demand, particularly in India, the OPEC cartel said Monday as it cut its forecasts.OPEC cut its estimates for world demand by 400,000 barrels a day for both this year and next. It now sees a drop in demand of 9.5 million barrels a day in 2020 and a rise of 6.6 million barrels in 2021.“Risks remain elevated and skewed to the downside, particularly in relation to the development of COVID-19 infection cases and potential vaccines,” the cartel said in a monthly report on the industry.Besides the trouble in some developing countries, which together with the United States have had a harder time than Europe or China in limiting the first wave of virus contagions, OPEC said it expected a slow pick-up in energy demand for transportation in rich countries. Airlines around the world are flying only a fraction of their normal amount of traffic, with a full recovery not expected for another couple of years.The price of oil plunged during the initial phase of the pandemic as businesses and transportation ground to a halt around the world. The uncertainty surrounding the industry, coupled with concerns about climate change, has pushed some major oil companies to shift more aggressively towards renewable energy or natural gas.BP says it expects demand for crude oil to peak in the early 2020s. If governments become more aggressive about reducing carbon emissions, demand might never recover from the current slump, its said in a report on the industry’s outlook.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Most would agree that Seth Rogen is definitely one of the most unique creatives working in Hollywood today. Let’s be honest, not too many people would be willing to write a comedy about stoners contending with hitmen or an animated film about anthropomorphic food behaving inappropriately.

ROSEVILLE, Calif. (KOVR) - Something stinks in a California town, and it has people lining up to see it.“I think I was gonna puke and die,” said one smiling child.It may look like something from the movie “Little Shop of Horrors,” but this 6-foot-7-inch Titan Arum, commonly known as the corpse flower, is real and lives up to its name."It’s actually pollinated by beetles and flies, so it’s trying to attract those insects, " said CJ Attington, a science teacher at Roseville High School. “So it gives off different sulfur compounds that mimic the odor of garbage and rotting flesh.”The plant, which grows naturally in hot and humid Sumatra, needs a little coaxing in this climate. That’s why it’s housed in a greenhouse at the high school.“We’re the only high school in the world that’s ever managed to bloom a corpse flower, so we’re quite proud of that,” Attington said.The science teacher has lovingly cared for it, which they named “Thing 2.”“The fact that it takes this type of maintenance and nine to 10 years to grow means you usually see it only at big facilities with staff and money,” he said.Attington built an audience around its arrival, setting up a webcam and a time-lapse to draw in crowds.“We’ve been on watch for the corpse flower for the last two weeks, so we’ve been watching it online, watching it grow, waiting for this moment for it to bloom,” said Kelley Newstead, a parent.Newstead wasn’t aware it was local until her kids brought it to her attention.“The height of it is absolutely incredible and the smell - yeah, I can’t describe it,” she said. “But it’s something that will stay with me for sure. I will remember that smell.”A truly unusual flower, Attington says its bulb must reach a whopping 35 to 40 pounds to flower. A smell to die for in what has been a year that really, well, stinks.“We’re having kind of an unpleasant time right now, and I think a lot of people are finding that this sort of thing is sort of like a little breath of fresh air,” Attington said.Copyright 2020 KOVR via CNN Newsource.
