Dear Dave,   With COVID-19 and all the resulting economic problems, do you have any advice for what a young person can do to prepare for the future?   Kyle
 Dear Kyle,   Regardless of the coronavirus or any economic situation that might arise, there are always a few smart, simple things people can do to protect themselves financially. The number one thing is to live on a written, monthly budget. When you give every dollar a name, and write it down on paper, you're telling your money what to do, instead of scratching your head and wondering where it went.
 Staying out of debt and saving as much money as possible are two other great ideas. Remember, your income is your biggest wealth-building tool. If you're saddled with a bunch of debt, your money goes to creditors - not into your pocket. Saving prepares you for the future and all the unexpected things, both good and bad, life will throw at you.
 Even though you're young, investing is a key component in creating a stable financial outlook for yourself. In your 20s, just $100 a month invested properly in good growth stock mutual funds can make you a millionaire by the time you're ready to retire.
 Like I said, these are all simple things. But they'll make a huge difference in your financial situation now and in the years to come!   Dave
 Pay that thing off!
    Dear Dave,   My only debt right now is a car payment. I still owe $12,000 on the vehicle, and I currently have $25,000 in savings. I'm in a very stable line of work, but my income can vary somewhat from month to month. Should I hang on to my savings, or pay off the car?   Erik
 Dear Erik,   Debt is a bad thing to have in your life, especially when your income can vary from paycheck to paycheck. You're in good shape, except for the car note, though. It's like a ball and chain around your neck.
 You'd still have $13,000 left if you paid off the car. And with the money you'd free up, you could rebuild your savings in no time. Pay off the car, dude!   Dave

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — State police have reopened an investigation into a white police officer suspected of making up a story about getting into a gunfight with a group of Black youths, officials said. The Cohoes police officer, Sean McKown, is under scrutiny for an incident June 6, when he was off duty at his weekend home in the Adirondack Mountains. State Police responded to the camp in Elizabethtown after McKown called 911 and said he'd been confronted by a group of eight to 10 Black males, and then exchanged gunshots with one of them before both sides retreated. But The Times Union, citing anonymous sources, reported earlier this year that when troopers arrived, McKown was asleep and “highly intoxicated.” McKown later called police and acknowledged the story about being shot at was a lie, the newspaper reported. This time, he said he fired shots into a tree stump out of fear. McKown’s police department north of Albany allowed him to retire rather than face potential disciplinary measures that could cost him his pension, but state police initially closed their investigation without filing charges. That led to criticism from activists and community leaders, who sent a petition with more than 700 signatures to Essex County District Attorney Kristy Sprague demanding a more thorough investigation. Sprague said in an email Wednesday that she wrote state police Aug. 10 asking for “additional investigative steps.” State Police recently met with Sprague and “there was agreement on conducting additional investigative steps in this case, which are underway,\" agency spokesman William Duffy said in an email Wednesday. Duffy and Sprague said they could not provide more details on the development, which was first reported by the Times-Union. A message seeking comment...

Dan Parise, the man responsible for iconic large-scale concerts in New York and other areas, has passed away at the age of 61. _Variety_ reports that the cause of death was cardiac arrest. A representative for Roc Nation, the company for which Parise created many events, confirmed the death.
 Parise spent 30 years producing live events, and he created some of the biggest spectacles in live entertainment. This includes Super Bowl halftime shows, the iHeart Radio Festival, the Made in America Festival and the Global Citizen Festival. He received an "Outstanding Special Class" Emmy nomination for his work on the _Beyonce & Jay-Z: On the Run _concert film. He also received a "Best Music Film" Grammy nomination for his work on the project.
 "He committed his life to his family at home and his family on the road, making each one of us better with each show. From working with Dave Matthews to Michelle Obama to Keith Richards, his mark on the entertainment and broadcast world will be felt for generations to come," a representative for Roc Nation said in a statement. The company also told _The Wrap_ that Parise ruled with "an iron fist" and that he brought "heart and greatness" to the events that he produced during his longtime career.
 Parise spent considerable time as part of Live Nation and helped create the Special Events division, which put together some massive events. One example is the two-day Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary concerts, as well as the "Concert for Hurricane Katrina Relief." This division later evolved and became an entirely new company, Diversified Production Services.

 While Parise did create some massive events for fans of live music, many knew him best for his impact on the sports world. He helped put on a Garth Brooks concert at Yankee Stadium and he put together the NBA All-Star Halftime Show. He also turned heads and drew praise with the Super Bowl LIV Halftime Show featuring Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.
 While the halftime show is only a mere 13 minutes long, putting it together takes an estimated year of preparation. "There are so many aspects of it, the dancers, the lighting elements, the special effects. It's like a big jigsaw puzzle," Parise said prior to 2020's iteration. He also explained that the addition of an overhang to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami provided the opportunity to implement more advanced audio equipment.

My pointework, especially, had taken a hit. At Butler, I used to take center on pointe, followed by additional pointe classes, pas de deux and rehearsals into the evening. With less-than-optimal flooring at home (carpet, concrete or slick wood that wouldn't hold the marley in place), I was lucky if I got 10 minutes in before fear of injury took over. Even on flat in technique class, with my marley square on the carpeted floor, any extra ankle stiffness or hip twinges heightened my anxiety. Traveling combinations proved tricky, and jumps larger than sautés were out of the question.
 As much as I tried to home in on internal awareness (which, thankfully, _did_ improve), I feared that bad habits would take over. Three years ago I underwent hip surgery because of incorrect placement, and that was an experience I would rather not repeat, especially now. Yet I also felt guilty—with so much uncertainty, fear and tragedy filling the world, considering my own career seemed wrong.

SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Oregon has recorded 22 deaths involving boats this year, the most since 1993 and nearing the record of 25. The Statesman- Journal reports that August was a particularly bad month, with eight fatal accidents; the most recent came last weekend when a man charged with boating under the influence slammed into a 13-year-old swimmer at Henry Hagg Lake. The numbers include both motorized and non-motorized boats, such as kayaks, but don’t include fatal accidents using inner tubes or swimming, though both are also higher than normal this summer, said Randy Henry, boating safety program manager for the Oregon State Marine Board. The spike is another result of the record number of people outdoors in a summer when COVID-19 has limited most other options. It has also meant more first-time boaters, Henry said, and a lot of inexperience on the water. “It’s partly the law of large numbers,” Henry said. “Lots of participation this year, which also means lots of novices. Motorized registrations are up as well and as noted earlier, we seem to be seeing a lot of boats coming out of retirement.”

Ffrench admits she was hesitant about joining forces unless she could put her own forward-thinking mark on the makeup. "I had mixed feelings because I wasn't really that interested in commercial makeup," she recalls. "I find it very repetitive, and it's always the same product and campaign imagery. I said, 'I will do this if we can really do something different.'" She added, "We wanted to create not only an innovative, interesting product, but we wanted to challenge the way people use them."
 Enter Byredo's inaugural line, which includes 16 multi-use color sticks, 15 lipsticks, lip balm, mascara, black liquid eyeliner, and three eye shadow palettes.

Instead, it focuses on Trump's economic message, an issue with broader appeal to Puerto Ricans in and around Orlando, for instance.
 The ad starts with a close up image of Biden, and then cuts to headlines and Spanish-language news reports about the 2008 financial crisis.
 "Joe Biden would devastate the economy," says a voice-over in Spanish. "His economic recovery was the worst."
 The ad features images of a concerned couple, a close-up of a child and an urban environment with a siren blaring in the background, with a chyron quoting a Pew Research Center report on an upsurge in Latino child poverty in 2011.
 "Our salaries stagnant, our children were impoverished," says the narrator. "Now Biden wants to raise our taxes."
 The Trump campaign's claim that Biden would raise taxes for a majority of Americans has been a source of debate, as the Democratic nominee has vowed not to raise taxes for anyone making under $400,000 a year.

 A number of independent analyses have found that Biden's tax plan would not directly raise taxes for anyone making under $400,000, but the fiscal burden of his corporate tax plan could land on taxpayers throughout the spectrum of income brackets, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker.
 The second half of the new ad focuses on Trump's record, touting the successes of the pre-pandemic economy.
 "President Trump fights for us," says the narrator, with the ad cutting to a Telemundo broadcast reporting the drop in Latino unemployment. Latino unemployment in September 2019 hit its lowest rate ever recorded, 3.9 percent, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
 "He achieved the lowest poverty [rate] in history," the narrator adds, speaking over a montage of workers, worksites and Trump signing orders and greeting people.
 "He did it before, and he will do it again," concludes the narrator.

I quit back in November. I've done this procedure a couple other times... the planned Cold Turkey. Now saying that "you have to want it" doesn't really cover it. From what I've heard, only heroin, alcohol, and benzo withdrawal are worse.      So what I did, is I got a quarter of primo (after abstaining for a week to decrease tolerance) and some melatonin.      Day one - wake up, eat, do other self care. Smoke the primo. See how long I can last before needing to "pull the plug" via the melatonin.      Night one - wake up, repeat.      Day two... day three...      Day 4, start re-acclimating to the world. Don't stress yourself. (Good to have as much crap out of your way as possible - all dr appointments, what have you)      Day 5, get a little deeper into the world.      Have coping and support mechanisms in place. I annoyed the hell out of my friends with my follow up phone calls but they thought it was worth it to help see me through.         Now, I am not a doctor so consult your physician. But this has worked for me 3 times. It was farking around while drinking, thinking "I Can Have Just One" that got me re-addicted.      Best of luck to all.

Nolan is “very pleased” with Warner Bros.’ innovative release plan that is allowing for a slow, patient and safe roll out. He also said it’s “completely understandable and completely fine” if some audiences aren’t yet ready to rush back to the theater. The $200 million picture will likely be playing for a long time as the entertainment industry finds its footing again.
 Not only does the slow roll out remind him of seeing movies as a kid, when he could see “Star Wars” in Ohio at his grandmother’s in the summer, and then again when it opened in England at Christmastime, but it also might be more gratifying than headlines about record opening weekends.
 “From an emotional point of view, it’s become tougher and tougher for filmmakers who spent years and years working on something and, even in success, it’s done in the culture within three weeks,” he said. “I think in some ways for the people who’ve made the film, it might actually feel more complete when all is said and done.”

Assuming MLAs approve the nomination of Melissa McCullough, it will fill a vacancy which has remained open since Douglas Bain stepped down in September 2017.
 Earlier this year Mr Bain told the BBC that it was "outrageous" that no one had been appointed to deal with what he believes is a significant number of complaints which have been building up about MLAs' conduct.
 In early July some Stormont parties pledged to report the Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill to the relevant authorities over her attendance at the funeral of the veteran republican Bobby Storey - but there was no one in place to receive such a complaint.
 Later in July, the Assembly authorities were left embarrassed when a retired solicitor selected for the post withdrew his interest, after a debate in the chamber to approve his nomination was called off at the last minute.
 Now the hope will be that Ms McCullough can get to grips with the pile of paperwork waiting in any new standards commissioner's in tray. An American who moved to Northern Ireland in the 1990s, Ms McCullough is an academic expert in medical ethics and law.
 She raised concerns about her own treatment from a Belfast neurologist who was suspended by the Belfast trust amidst concerns about possible misdiagnoses.
 In April Ms McCullough also warned about the need to provide PPE to frontline care workers after her own mother died in a US nursing home hit by a Covid-19 19 outbreak.

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — The head of a progressive political party in New York is urging voters to cast votes on the party's line at a time when a new state law is jeopardizing the future of minor parties. Political parties must now receive 2% of the vote — or 130,000 votes — in the previous presidential or gubernatorial election to qualify as a party and get on the ballot. A political party’s status will now be reviewed every other year starting in November. The state’s new ballot qualification requirements are set to take effect under a federal judge's Tuesday decision, meaning that minor parties could lose their spot on the ballot in future elections if they don't get enough votes in November. Minor political parties could also lose other benefits, including the ability to appear on voter registration forms and receive unlimited contributions from donors to cover administrative costs. New York Working Families Party State Director Sochie Nnaemeka criticized New York’s new law, which her party has tried to block in an ongoing legal battle. “The state has no business making it harder for progressive New Yorkers to vote their values,” Nnaemeka said in a statement to The Associated Press. Previously, political parties had to requalify every four years by receiving over 50,000 votes in the gubernatorial election. In New York, minor political parties can form coalitions with other parties and endorse major party candidates under a practice known as “fusion voting,” which is banned by most states. The unique practice means that candidates can appear multiple times on a ballot under different party lines. For example, the Working Families Party is hoping that New York voters will vote for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and vice presidential...

At one point, the Americans fired tear gas at an energetic group of protesters that had climbed atop one of the burned reception buildings, but for the most part, the battle was over. At the end of the day, the protestors, heeding demands from their own militia leaders to stop, packed up their tents and departed.

Central ministries and PSUs have cleared payments to the tune of over Rs 6,800 crore owed to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the last three months, the government said on Wednesday. It said almost three-fourths of the monthly dues have been paid during the same month by most of the ministries and CPSEs.The pending amounts are expected to be released in the normal course of business and within 45 days. The MSME ministry, in a statement, said that &quot;more than Rs 6,800 crore has been paid by the Ministries and CPSEs in the last three months alone&quot;.In May, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that MSMEs' receivables from the government and Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) will be released within 45 days. The Ministry of MSME said it followed up on this announcement vigorously and took up the matter with the central ministries, CPSEs, and state governments. Particularly, very active follow up has been done with the heads of CPSEs, it added. To make the reporting easy, regular, and seamless, a dedicated online format has been made for reporting the monthly payments and pendency, the ministry said.The MSME Development Act of 2006 provides that such dues should be paid within 45 days. &quot;However, it is seen that MSME suppliers of goods and services do not receive their due payments within a stipulated time. Public and private entities do cross this time limit and hence they cause hardship to the MSMEs,&quot; the statement said.The ministry also said close to 4 lakh registrations have already taken place on the Udyam registration portal for MSMEs since the new system was launched in July.(With PTI inputs)

A self-described "proud Islamophobe," Loomer has been banned from several social media platforms for violating policies around hate speech.
 In 2017, she tweeted "how many more people need to die before everyone agrees that Islam is cancer & we should never let another Muslim into the civilized world?" That same year she was banned from Uber and Lyft after she tweeted that “someone needs to create a non Islamic form of @uber or @lyft."
 In 2018, Loomer was removed from Twitter after she persistently harassed Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. She was removed from Facebook and Instagram in May 2019 for similar harassment.
 Loomer's controversial remarks go beyond just Islamophobia: She has baselessly suggested that the 2018 high school shooting in Parkland, Fla., was a "false flag event" and celebrated the death of 2,000 migrants at sea.
 Several congressional Republicans have nonetheless endorsed Loomer, including Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.).
 She has also received the support of President Trump, who said after her primary win that she has "a great chance against a Pelosi puppet" in November, referring to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

Under new guidelines, FEMA will only pay for PPE that will prevent a "direct emergency," which includes direct medical care, mass casualty management (handling dead bodies), and some food services.
 According to a transcript of a call between the agency and state and tribal officials obtained by NPR, PPE for schools  and other businesses are now considered "increased operational costs" and will be covered by Health and Human Services (HHS). This comes just two weeks after teachers were deemed essential workers by the White House, meaning they would be "prioritized" for PPE, according to CNN.
 "Supporting schools and other functions -- courthouses and other related functions - are not a direct emergency protective measures and therefore they're not eligible for [Public Assistance]," Turi said on the conference call, according to NPR.
 It's not just face masks that are effected with these new changes, as disinfectant costs will no longer be covered as well.
