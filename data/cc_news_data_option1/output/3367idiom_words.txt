 # Brannon Spector following two heritages with Clemson football
 Todd Shanesy
 Herald-Journal
 Brannon Spector has a couple of football heritages to continue at Clemson.
 Name and number.
 While honoring both, he says, “I’m just trying to be me.”
 Spector is a redshirt freshman wide receiver, following Tiger paw tracks of graduate-school linebacker brother Baylon and also their father, Robbie, a former Clemson wide receiver.
 “I came here when I was little,” Brannon said, “just watching games, thinking, ‘Man, I want to play here.’ Actually being here on the field is shocking. I never thought I would ever be here. But I’m thankful and I’m blessed.”
 Then there is the No. 13.
 It has had quite a lineage as well.
 Tyler Grisham wore that number from 2005 through 2008, finishing with eight touchdowns and nearly 1,400 yards before playing a few games for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He is now Clemson’s wide receivers coach.
 Adam Humphries from Dorman High School wore that number from 2011 through 2014, finishing with three touchdowns and more than 1,000 yards before joining the NFL with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers; he is now with the Tennessee Titans.
 Hunter Renfrow, son of former Wofford football and baseball standout Tim Renfrow, a Hall of Famer for the Terriers, wore that No.13 from 2015 through 2018, made the game-winning catch to beat Alabama for the 2018 national championship, and is now with the NFL’s Raiders, formerly from Oakland and now in Las Vegas.
 All of them were slot receivers. So is Brannon Spector. He made it known that he wanted to wear No. 13.
 “I did request it,” said Spector, who is listed as the second-team slot behind Amari Rodgers but has been working with the first team because of injuries at wide receiver. “I came here thinking I was going to play the slot, too. So I was like, ‘Hey, man, maybe I can continue on and be the next No. 13 slot receiver. All three of them were great receivers. I’m just here to keep that standard high. … When I first came here, I felt a little bit of pressure just because of what the previous guys have done. But lately I have just let it go.”
 And then there is the pressure of being the younger brother of Baylon, who has his own burden this season of trying to replace Isaiah Simmons, the No. 8 overall NFL draft pick of the Arizona Cardinals. Simmons was selected ACC defensive player of the year and was Clemson’s first winner of the Butkus Award given to the best linebacker in the country.
 The Spector brothers are closer now than at any point since Baylon left home in January of 2017 as an early enrollee at Clemson. The relationship has grown this summer.
 “We hang out as much as possible and do as much as we can,” Baylon said. “We live in the same neighborhood now, so we see each other a lot more than when he was on campus. Now that he’s off campus and is older, it’s definitely gotten stronger and better.”
 After spring practice was cut short because of coronavirus concerns, the brothers worked with each other and also against each other, offense versus defense, back home in Calhoun, Georgia. The one often throwing passes was Clemson star quarterback Trevor Lawrence from Cartersville, Georgia, about half an hour away, or former Calhoun High quarterback Gavin Gray, now at Berry College in Rome, Georgia.
 “(Baylon) would try to guard me on some one-on-ones. That didn’t go too well for him,” Brannon said. ‘I’ll give him some credit. He won a few. But I’ve gotten a little bit quicker.”
 “He’s definitely improved so much. You can tell,” Baylon said. “I enjoy watching him go out there and do what he does and make catches. I always joke with him that I’m still faster than him and I’d like to race.”
 “No, he’s not faster than me,” Brannon said. “That’s funny.”
 “But he’d be scared of me,” Baylon said, “if he were to come across the middle.”
