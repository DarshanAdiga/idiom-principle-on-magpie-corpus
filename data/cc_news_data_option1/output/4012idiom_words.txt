 # Starter or reliever? Cincinnati Reds will have a decision to make on Michael Lorenzen

 The Cincinnati Reds have plenty of internal roster decisions that they must weigh at the beginning of the offseason, but one of the most intriguing questions is what the Reds will do with pitcher Michael Lorenzen.
 He started the 2020 season as the team’s primary setup man in the back of the bullpen. He struggled for the first two weeks and was moved into a long-relief role, making seven multi-inning relief appearances. Then he was inserted into the rotation for two spot starts when Sonny Gray and Wade Miley were sidelined with injuries.
 Lorenzen completed the season with a 4.28 ERA in 33 ⅔ innings, but those numbers don’t show how well he pitched in the final six weeks. He posted a 1.91 ERA across his last 11 outings, striking out 29 in 28 ⅓ innings and he stranded five of his seven inherited runners.
 He struck out six of the 11 batters he faced in the postseason, pitching 2 ⅔ scoreless frames against the Atlanta Braves.
 “I think he set himself up to be looked at next year as a possible solution for our starting five,” Reds pitching coach Derek Johnson said. “I know he wants to do that, and I don’t think it’s been any secret that he wants to do that. He’s put himself in that position to potentially do that. I think there is some competition there for him.
 “One of the things that we’ve always loved about Michael is just the idea that he’s been a pretty good bullpen piece too. Started off rough this year and kind of got himself out of it and then took on this new role, which really wasn’t by design. It just sort of happened. All of a sudden, it was like, ‘Wow, we’ve got something kind of cool here.’ ”
 The Reds acquired Archie Bradley at the trade deadline and Lucas Sims emerged as a reliable late-inning option out of the bullpen, so the club has some flexibility to figure out Lorenzen’s role.
 With Trevor Bauer and Anthony DeSclafani entering free agency, there are two spots open in the rotation. Tyler Mahle, Tejay Antone and Lorenzen are the leading internal candidates. Dick Williams, the president of baseball operations, said José De León, Nick Lodolo and Hunter Greene give them more options too.
 “If you are able to do something with Bauer or Disco or another free agent, that only adds to that group,” Williams said. “I feel good that there’s at least a depth of names up there. Tyler Mahle, Tejay and Michael Lorenzen, those are guys that really have some upside there if they plug into the rotation, but they are absolutely going to help us either in the rotation or bullpen.”
 Lorenzen struggled as a starter in 2015, his rookie year, but it was a new experience for him. His primary position in college was center field, and he was a closer when he pitched. He was a starter in Double-A in 2014, then it was trial-by-fire in his first big-league season. He’s always wanted another chance at it and he’s the rare reliever who consistently throws four or five pitches.
 In starts against the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago White Sox, Lorenzen yielded three runs and seven hits in 9 ⅔ innings, issuing two walks and striking out 14.
 “I’ve seen myself as a starter for my entire career,” Lorenzen said in the last week of the season. “Nothing has changed in that department.”
 Lorenzen, who will be a free agent after the 2021 season, was affected by forearm/wrist soreness at the end of preseason camp in July, which contributed to his early-season woes.
 “I knew how important my role was, but I had an injury in here,” said Lorenzen, pointing to his wrist. “I was fighting through it and I created some bad habits with not being able to finish my pitches and really pull down just because it hurt so bad.
 “I didn’t have my cutter. I didn’t have my slider. I didn’t have my changeup, which was my best pitch last year. I kept shot-putting it because I wasn’t pulling down. I wasn’t finishing the pitch. That all came from that injury there, just creating bad habits and trying to throw through that pain.”
 If Lorenzen is moved into the rotation, it gives the Reds more opportunities to use him in a two-way role. On a team that lacks speed, Lorenzen is one of their fastest runners.
 He received only one plate appearance – hit by a pitch – because there was a designated hitter, but he entered as a pinch-runner four times and he played center field for four innings.
 “I do think he’s put himself in that (rotation) conversation,” Johnson said. “Where we need to go, a lot of it is going to depend on who is going to come back, who we might get or whatever, but I think he’s at least in a really strong conversation for it.”
