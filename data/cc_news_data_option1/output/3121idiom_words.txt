 A 2020 high school football season in Ohio is not yet a sure thing. Nothing is in the age of COVID-19.
 But if the governor approves a season this fall, it will be unlike any other that's come before it.
 The Ohio High School Athletic Association announced late Friday afternoon a plan for a six-game regular season followed by an early start to the playoffs, with all teams being eligible for the postseason. The plan is contingent on Gov. Mike DeWine approving high school football as being safe to play this season.
 OHSAA -- in a media release sent out just before 5 p.m., Friday -- said it came up with the plan following a recommendation this week from the governor's office to shorten the season due to concerns that COVID-19 may spike in early winter.
