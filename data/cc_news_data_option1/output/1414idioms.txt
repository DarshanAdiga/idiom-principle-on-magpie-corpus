LONDON -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson was resting in hospital on Friday, recovering from COVID-19, while his fellow Britons were told to resist the temptation of spring sunshine over Easter as the coronavirus outbreak approaches a peak.
 The flamboyant 55-year-old leader's visible decline shook the nation, but he came out of three nights of intensive care at St Thomas' Hospital on Thursday, having been admitted after suffering from a high temperature and cough.
 "The prime minister is back on a ward and continuing his recovery, which is at an early stage," his spokesman told reporters.
 "I was told he was waving his thanks to all of the nurses and doctors he saw as he was moved from the intensive care unit back to the ward. The hospital said that he was in extremely good spirits last night."
 Johnson was the first world leader to be hospitalized with the coronavirus, forcing him to hand control to foreign minister Dominic Raab just as Britain's situation worsened drastically.
 The death toll is 7,978 - the fifth highest in the world.
 Despite his condition improving, it remained unclear how long Johnson would be incapacitated. His spokesman said his recovery was only just beginning and he would take advice from his medical team.
 "He must rest up," his father, Stanley Johnson, told BBC radio. "You cannot walk away from this and go straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment."
 Johnson's pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, who has also had coronavirus symptoms, tweeted a rainbow picture - in support of healthcare workers - along with hand-clapping emojis.
 In the prime minister's absence, the government must consider if and when it can end Britain's lockdown, though Raab on Thursday said it was too early to make a decision because the country had not yet reached the peak of the outbreak.
 The government says it will have a better idea by next week of whether the lockdown has succeeded in reducing coronavirus infections and hospital admissions.
 "We've started already to see plateauing," said epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, a professor at Imperial College in London, who has helped to shape the official response.
 It will take several more days for the pace of deaths to drop and more weeks to draw definitive conclusions that could allow restrictions to be lifted, he added to BBC radio.
 Britain is enduring its third week of stringent restrictions, during which police have assumed new powers to fine people who stray too far or too long from home unless on essential work or seeking food and medicines.
 With the start of a four-day Easter holiday greeted by glorious sunshine, authorities were on the lookout for those tempted out to see family and friends, potentially jeopardizing the impact of the lockdown.
 Scotland's chief medical officer has already resigned after flouting her own advice to stay at home, and a senior minister was under pressure on Friday after newspapers said he traveled to a second home outside London and visited his parents.
 "For clarity - my parents asked me to deliver some essentials - including medicines," housing minister Robert Jenrick tweeted in defence, adding that he had left London to return to his family home.
 "We are confident that he complied with the social distancing rules," Johnson's spokesman said.
 The prime minister's father, Stanley, said his son's illness would serve as a lesson for the public.
 "If it can hit the prime minister, for heaven's sake, well it does come close to home," he said.

Your emergency fund is a stockpile of savings you have to fall back on when unexpected expenses arise. In normal times, the rule of thumb is to have three-to-six months of living expenses set aside in easily accessible cash holdings. But in the current climate, you definitely want to err on the longer side of this range, and it wouldn't hurt to have even more than six months of expenses set aside.

Before the pandemic, Sheila Flanagan, the co-owner of the Nettle Meadow Sanctuary Farm in Thurman, which sells a variety of cheeses made from various combinations of cow, goat and sheep milk, said she wasn’t initially sure how much of her business relied on restaurants and retail because her farm sold to distributors.
 After the pandemic hit, she quickly found out. It became clear that 75 percent of her business relied on universities, restaurants and retail spaces. With all of them now shuttered, she’s operating at about one fourth of her normal capacity.
 She’s been forced to slash her cheese prices by about 30 percent just to capture the imagination and shelf space of retailers that remain open. About two-thirds of her cheese products are now being donated to food banks.
 “In order to do any sort of farming, you have have a lot of optimism and hope for the best but prepare for the worst,” Flanagan said. “We’re really ping- ponging from day to day, between sheer panic and kind of putting our heads down and looking for that light at the end of the tunnel.”
 Right now, Flanagan said, there simply isn’t a taste for the artisan cheeses that make up the backbone of her business. She said Whole Foods is the one retailer that’s provided her business a silver lining in this crisis.
 Now, the farm has pivoted to starting a community vegetable garden. But those products won’t be for sale — they’ll be meant for keeping food on the table for Flanagan and the Nettle Meadow staff.
 “Those are the sorts of things we’re doing because there’s really no clear path forward,” Flanagan said. “We could end up really broke by the end of May — but we can keep our doors open. If this extends longer than that, it’s going to be really tough.”
 Is there hope on the horizon for New York dairy farmers? Novakovic isn’t so sure.
 “All of us, particularly those in this business, really need to be realistic and pretty brutally honest with ourselves with whether or not we’re going to be able to ride out this storm,” he said. “If you can see a way through it, while being realistic, O.K., fine.
 If not, he said, “then maybe start thinking about Plan B.”

Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl has challenged his side to produce a reaction as they look to collect their first points of the new Premier League season at Brighton.
 The Saints went down 2-1 at home to Liverpool last weekend, which followed on from a 3-0 defeat at Burnley on the opening weekend.
 And Hasenhuttl expects a much-improved display from his side at the Amex Stadium on Saturday.
 “It was much better against Liverpool, but, even then, the chance was there to take something and we didn’t,” the Austrian said.
 “That all means we have no points so far. I don’t want to say this is more pressure, because we give ourselves the most pressure.
 “We want to take points consistently, and so far we didn’t.
 “Now we want to go to Brighton and show again a reaction in a way that means we are also able to take points in an away game.”
 Hasenhuttl added, in quotes on the club’s official website: “The atmosphere is focused, and they try to work hard.
 “But finally we must show on the weekend that we are concentrated enough to have maybe a clean sheet and work 90 minutes to get a good result.”
 After playing Brighton and a Carabao Cup fixture at Fulham, the Saints host Manchester United ahead of the international break.
 Hasenhuttl knows his team cannot afford too many more below-par displays as the season starts to roll on.
 “It’s about taking points consistently. In the first two games we haven’t, which is not the start we wanted, but we knew the schedule was difficult,” the Saints boss said.
 “Even then, it was not impossible to take points against Liverpool, so we must be focused that it doesn’t matter on the game or the opponent, there is always the chance to take something.”
 Brighton have made an encouraging start under new boss Graham Potter, winning 3-0 at Watford and then drawing against West Ham.
 Hasenhuttl has been impressed with the way in which the former Ostersunds and Swansea manager has gone about making his mark at the south-coast club.
 “It is a completely different philosophy now – much more with the ball, very calm on the ball and a different shape now,” he said.
 “It is a very big change from last season. He has the players he needs for this shape, which is similar to our shape and should make for an interesting game.”

Brighton boss Graham Potter expects struggling Southampton to provide the sternest test of his short tenure as a Premier League manager.
 Potter has made an impressive start with the Seagulls, winning convincingly at Watford before his side dominated last weekend’s draw with West Ham.
 South coast rivals Saints arrive at the Amex Stadium on Saturday having lost successive top-flight games against Burnley and Liverpool.
 However, Potter is a big admirer of Ralph Hasenhuttl’s team and played down the significance of the clubs’ contrasting starts to the season.
 “Points at this stage can be misleading. I think if you look at their performance against Liverpool, especially, they were unlucky not to take anything,” said Potter.
 “I think it will be our toughest game so far because of how Southampton are and how they play.
 “I’m really impressed with what they’ve done, with what they bring and how they try and play football, so for us we’re still at the stage where every single game is a big, big fight for us to take the points.
 “And we don’t think too much about what is predicted to happen or, on paper, what should happen.
 “It’s another Premier League game, we have to focus on an opportunity to win but we know also that the teams we are playing against can beat us so we have to go with that humility and try our best.”
 Before replacing the sacked Chris Hughton in May, Potter’s only previous Premier League experience was gained as a Southampton player during the 1996-97 season.
 The 44-year-old made eight top-flight appearances for a Saints side led by the attacking talents of Matt Le Tissier, Eyal Berkovic and Egil Ostenstad.
 He recalls that era being a pivotal phase for the growth of English football.
 “It was just the start of the Premier League, I think it was the first influx of foreign players – (Roberto) Di Matteo, that group, if my memory serves me correct,” he said.
 “Dennis Bergkamp might have been coming into the league at that point and it’s just grown and grown, the profile across the world, it’s become the destination league.
 “In terms of how the game is played, I think it’s played quicker because of how everything has developed, sports science has had that influence.
 “It wasn’t so long before we (English clubs) were in that European ban (following the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster) so English football was a bit insular and I think the Premier League has allowed an influx of people from all over the world and made the product fantastic.”
 Albion have no fresh injury concerns but winger Jose Izquierdo, defender Ezequiel Schelotto (both knee) and midfielder Yves Bissouma (shoulder) remain sidelined.

While Broscheid supports Gov. Doug Ducey’s decision to keep the parks open, stay-at-home orders and travel advisories seem to have had a significant impact at the parks. Lake Havasu State Park is one of the most popular parks in the state, but Arizona State Parks spokeswoman Michelle Thompson said the park has been getting significantly fewer daily visitors recently.
 “At Lake Havasu State Park especially, we typically have large events in March and into April,” Thompson said. “Those were all canceled, and day use was lower by almost half. Camping is about the same as last year.”
 Thompson didn’t have specific numbers, but she said that Buckskin Mountain, Cattail Cove, Lake Havasu and River Island have all seen attendance drop by about 30 percent including both day use and camping.
 Lake Havasu State Park Manager Daniel Roddy said Saturdays are generally the busiest day of the week, and weekends are considerably busier than weekdays. The largest single factor, in normal times, is the weather but Roddy said the health crisis is lowering the parks’ attendance numbers across the board with a particularly noticeable drop off in the last couple weeks.
 Roddy said the upcoming weekend, which would normally include the Lake Havasu City Boat Show, is typically one of the park’s busiest of the season. He said the park won’t have nearly the amount of people as would otherwise have visited this weekend, but he is expecting a modest increase of visitors due to good weather in the forecast.
 “We have preparations in place to be welcoming to any safe number of people this weekend,” Roddy said. “I can’t really say what that number is because part of it will be dependent on the flow of the day. Our biggest thing is the crowd being a safe number of people that is manageable. We have to make sure our main priority is not how many people, but that it is safe and manageable.”
 Roddy said Lake Havasu State Park always keeps track of the number of visitors inside the park at any given time, and will close the park to new entries if there is overcrowding. Roddy said the only time he knows of that happening at Lake Havasu was July 5, 2019 when the entire city was at or near capacity.
 Without giving specifics, Roddy said Lake Havasu State Park’s capacity has been “significantly reduced,” in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
 “The numbers we are talking now are significantly below the true capacity of the property, but in the interest of safety and maintaining crowd management abilities we have dialed all that back,” Roddy said.
 Even with the reduced maximum capacity in the park, Roddy said attendance over the last couple weeks hasn’t come particularly close to the revised limits.
 Roddy said that keeping crowds at “safe and manageable” numbers is the parks primary focus.
 “We have been in constant contact with our city officials as well as our park director in Phoenix to make sure that we all are in agreement on how to best manage crowds and keep crowds safe – how we limit contact and adhere to the CDC and Arizona Department of Health Services guidelines,” he said. “So we have been doing a lot of things that might not be as up front and obvious to people. For example, when we block off a section of a parking lot or when we direct traffic. The steps that we’ve taken, sometimes they are not as noticeable as other times.”

The Narendra Modi government did well to lift export restrictions on certain drugs, especially hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the anti- malarial drug that United States (US) President Donald Trump has touted as a game-changer in the fight against the coronavirus disease. Even though the drug's efficacy against the deadly pathogen remains scientifically unproven, if it helps save lives, as Trump and some of his advisers have contended, letting US orders go through is the right thing to do on humanitarian grounds. This is presuming India did not dip too deep into its own reserves.Equally important perhaps are the implications for the bilateral relationship. Americans have for long been very clear that while they may seem, and have been, genuinely supportive and generous with India, they don't expect to see the relationship run like a charity. There is an expectation of returns, pay back -- reciprocity, as Trump likes to put it. No administration, Republican or Democratic, has been less or more transactional; the current dispensation is avowedly more.Anyone who doubts that should check the archives to learn of the outpouring of indignation in 2012 when India overlooked the bids of two US companies for 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft. The Americans had expected to win the multibillion-dollar contract -- among other things, as an expression of gratitude from India for the civil nuclear deal signed four years before, that ended India's nuclear isolation.There have been constant reminders then of India's voting record at the United Nations (UN), that does not align with US interest (guess what, not so surprisingly India has voted mostly in line with its own interest). Americans express a sense of hurt that this is so despite the growing relationship and all that the US does for India at the UN, especially to block or fend off the Chinese on a range of issues, including shaming it last year and getting it to agree to designate Masood Azhar a terrorist.Just as the HCQ decision does not take care of all past favours, it will not unlock a bottomless treasure trove of goodies. But its significance for the relationship cannot be overstated, as Trump himself acknowledged in a thank-you tweet on Wednesday.In the short-term, can India expect to be an early beneficiary of the vaccines that are either undergoing clinical trials in the US or are about to? More than two dozen pharmaceutical companies are racing to find a vaccine; two of them got off the starting line just this past Wednesday.Human trials began on one in Seattle in mid-March, which could hit the markets next year. Gilead Sciences' investigational drug, remdesivir, has been called the most promising of antiviral treatments on the way. India might also need ventilators and other medical supplies that are being cranked out or repurposed in American manufacturing facilities.In the longer-term, Indians will feel most reassured by the president's promise that their gesture of goodwill at this time of grave crisis for the US "will not be forgotten".yashwant.raj@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal

All are essential workers
 I am sick and tired of politicians, news commentators and others telling us that only “essential businesses” and “essential workers” matter in this current environment.
 What constitutes essential and who makes that determination? Truthfully, EVERY business and EVERY worker are essential! If you own a small restaurant or a bookstore or a car dealership or a movie theater to name a few, your business is essential. You need it to support your family, pay your bills, prepare for retirement. You employ others, providing them with their livelihood and the means to care for their own families. No business or worker is more valuable than another. Again, all the jobs regular Americans do are essential. They are necessary for our way of life.

My dog is squirrel obsessed.      This is not as much of an issue now that we moved to the city, but it was a big problem when we lived in the suburbs where there were a kajillion squirrels. I had to imagine he was genetically wired for this because he did not have any kind of traumatic squirrel experience as a puppy that would cause him to have a squirrel vendetta. Of course they may have ganged up on him when I wasn't looking and pelted him with acorns or something just for laughs, and I never knew about it. He was actually traumatized by a giant woodchuck that lived under our deck years ago, so maybe he thought all squirrels were small woodchucks and this was his way of working through his issues. This was not such a stretch considering the first time I saw the woodchuck, I thought it was a beaver. Maybe wildlife idiocy runs in the family.      Whatever the reason, the dog was clearly not a fan of squirrels and would sit by the deck door watching the backyard like some kind of squirrel mercenary. Neither sleep nor hunger would tear him from his post unless of course he needed a nap or heard the sound of food accidentally dropping on the kitchen floor. When a squirrel appeared, he would growl menacingly and finally erupt into a fit of hysterical barking until I let him outside to chase the man- eating squirrel over the fence or up a tree.      This happened ... no kidding ... every five minutes.      Like I said, there were a lot of squirrels out there.      In the city, however, there were not that many squirrels around, so the dog took to hating pigeons instead. I have to admit, I was kind of with him on that. At least the squirrels didn't poop on your head from above.      Unbeknownst to me, though, the pigeon thing had the potential to be an even bigger problem. In the suburbs, I could just let the dog run wild in our backyard to chase squirrels. (He never caught any, but I think it was just the thrill of the chase). But in the city, the dog was on a leash. And I didn't learn about his pigeon obsession until I had him out for a walk. As we strolled down the street, we came across a flock of pigeons just hanging out on the sidewalk, doing their pigeony things.      When the dog saw them, he lost his mind.      He lurched after the pigeons, dragging me behind him like a piece of toilet paper on the bottom of your shoe. And then the pigeons did something that squirrels don't do. They flew. Thinking he could follow them, the dog flew, too … for one second. Just long enough for me to also fly … into a tree.      Had I not gone face first into a tree, I might have been impressed that:   a) the dog thought he could fly,   b) all the pigeons got away, and   c) my face found one of only three trees on the whole street.      As I sat in the dirt next to the tree, the dog came over to me. He did not try to comfort me or come to my assistance in any way. Instead, he looked at the tree with some obvious interest.      I shook my head at him.      "Don't even think about it!"   You can follow Tracy on Twitter @TracyBeckerman and become a fan on Facebook at www.facebook.com/LostinSuburbiaFanPage.

Sebastien Haller continued his goalscoring form as West Ham made it back-to- back Premier League wins with a 2-0 victory over Norwich at the London Stadium.
 The French striker scored twice in the Hammers’ win at Watford last weekend and only had to wait until the 24th minute to strike again to put Manuel Pellegrini’s side ahead.
 The hosts continued to dominate in the second half as Andriy Yarmolenko hit his first goal since September 2018, volleying past Tim Krul to give his side their first home win of the season.
 Norwich slumped to their third defeat of their first league four matches and failed to score a goal for the first time in the Premier League this season.
 They head into the international break with four losses from five matches in all competitions.
 West Ham started brightly and had a half-hearted penalty shout in the 12th minute when Yarmolenko went down in the box, but referee Paul Tierney waved play on without consulting VAR.
 Yarmolenko then played the ball through to Felipe Anderson who drove down the right before trying to take on the shot himself, despite Haller waiting in the box, and his effort was saved at the near post by Krul.
 Haller made the most of his side’s dominance though, slotting the ball past Krul after Arthur Masuaku squared the ball for the unmarked striker.
 The Canaries’ ongoing injury problems worsened when captain Christoph Zimmermann was forced off in the 36th minute on his Premier League debut having just returned from a knee problem.
 Norwich came close to equalising towards the end of the first half, as Max Aarons weaved his way into the box before sending a high cross towards Todd Cantwell, but the ball was just too high for the midfielder, who nodded over from close range.
 With the visitors pushing for the leveller it was West Ham who doubled the lead. Yarmolenko hit the post moments before firing into the net on the rebound after an effort from captain Mark Noble.
 After the second goal Norwich lost their intensity going forward. Teemu Pukki, who scored five goals in his first three Premier League matches, had to wait until the hour mark to get his first shot of game.
 The Finland striker’s effort lacked power and went straight at West Ham keeper Lukasz Fabiankski.
 The Hammers continued to assert their dominance, coming close twice in two minutes with Krul putting a deflected Ryan Fredericks cross out for a corner and Emi Buendia nodding a goal-bound header from Issa Diop off the line.
 With just over 10 minutes left of the game, Krul denied West Ham a third, tipping Manuel Lanzini’s header over the bar, before making a double save just a minute later from Anderson and Haller.

Plans are in the works to house unsheltered homeless people in an 182-room Augusta hotel during the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Augusta Housing and Community Development said the agreement is with the Doubletree by Hilton on Perimeter Parkway, while four other Hilton properties also are available.
   
 "Providing shelter for our homeless population is essential, and the right thing to do, right now. Time is of the essence," Augusta Mayor Hardie Davis said.
   
 "Giving shelter to our homeless population will allow compliance with the shelter-in-place order during this crisis, and our goal is to help as many individuals and families as possible," Davis said.
   
 Augusta's 2020 point in time count revealed 287 unsheltered homeless people, with likely nearly to as many staying in shelters or other facilities, said Daniel Evans, community development manager for the department.
   
 The results are not finalized because U.S. Housing and Urban Development delayed the process due to the pandemic, Evans said.
   
 Among the area's unsheltered, James Taylor, 59, was parked at a city park Thursday. He and his dog, Rebel, were living out of his loaded pickup truck.
   
 Taylor said he'd welcome a hotel room but was afraid to leave his truck and belongings behind.
   
 Augusta Commissioner Ben Hasan said he supports the housing plan because the federal government has allocated around $500,000 for Augusta to shelter its homeless.
   
 He's heard from constituents who lost their jobs and were about to lose their homes.
   
 "The federal government is allocating about half a million dollars for the coronavirus and we need to take full advantage of it," he said.
   
 The CARES Act allocated $400 billion in Emergency Solutions Grants and Community Development Block Grants for emergency housing. The funds no longer require matching funds and will soon be distributed in waves.
   
 Augusta commissioners had many questions about the plan and some said they were initially led to believe the hotel would shelter homeless who were positive for the novel coronavirus.
   
 Commissioner Marion Williams asked who would pay for any damages the hotel incurs, housekeeping and other cleanup and how residents will be kept separate from one another.
   
 Those being housed will be instructed "to behave responsibly and at a certain point, we must trust that they can police themselves," said Hawthorne Welcher, director of the city housing department.
   
 Hilton is waiving the cost of any damages and is responsible for housekeeping and cleanliness, Welcher said.
   
 Hilton also will supply residents with the toiletries found in each room and a free breakfast, he said in correspondence obtained by The Augusta Chronicle.
   
 Homeless in need will go through the Marion Barnes Resource Center for the Homeless on East Boundary.
   
 Since March 16, the center has processed 100 requests for information and referred 38 to accommodations, and the city has identified around 20 families ready to move in, Welcher said.
   
 If needed, transportation to the hotel will be provided by Hilton while transport away will likely be restricted.

 Williams also was concerned about the health of residents. The homeless are susceptible to diseases due to living conditions and tend to have poorer outcomes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
   
 "Who's going to screen these people who haven't been to the doctor in years?" Williams said.
   
 The funds won't cover COVID-19 testing, health mitigation or treatment. The city won't check a person's status or test result, Welcher said.
   
 Commissioner Dennis Williams said he is seeking more information before the commission votes on the plan on April 21.
   
 Williams said he thinks the residents will be screened carefully.
   
 "The resource center will determine if they go or not. As I understand it we're not just picking people off the street," he said.
   
 Commissioner John Clarke said as with other commission decisions during the pandemic, the body is asked to approve costly programs without complete information.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WAFF) - Tens of thousands of Alabamians have lost their jobs in recent weeks. Which likely means many of them also lost their health insurance.Mary Elizabeth Marr with Thrive Alabama says you shouldn't wait until you need it to apply.It’s more important than ever to have health insurance, but you may not know where to start.Mary Elizabeth Marr, the CEO for Thrive Alabma, tells us she’s taken a lot of calls from people worried about this.Marr says you should start by going to healthcare.gov. Although the open enrollment period has passed.. You can see if you qualify for the special enrollment period.If you’ve been laid off or fired due to COVID-19, and lost healthcare coverage suddenly, you likely will qualify.Marr says you can find different options for plans, and says this is the most affordable way to go.Marr says it’s really important to get this done as soon as possible, if you wait until you need insurance, it might be too late.“This needs to be taken care of right away. Don’t wait until you need to see a physician and try to get some insurance. It would be necessary for you to go ahead and get this done within the first 60 days of loss of insurance," Marr said.One critical thing to remember, Alabama is one of 14 states that did not expand medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which means fewer people are eligible for that program in the state.Copyright 2020 WAFF.

I will not go through the list (jobs, Truax being able to stay open, effectiveness of sound mitigation which may not be paid for, etc.), but there is nothing that justifies citizen displacement and making your hometown a less desirable place to live, through pollution of water and air. And, then there is the money spent on a plane that is well known to be continually problematic and over the top expensive.

In response to Lowell Greenbaum's assertion to the contrary ("Trump weak and inept," April 7), President Trump has demonstrated true leadership on a daily basis despite the coordinated efforts of the socialist globalists in the government and media.
   
 Dr. Anthony Fauci told Newsmax TV in January that the U.S. had no cause for alarm about COVID-19. Months later, he considers it imperative to close down every state. During a White House meeting in January, it was decided not to evacuate State Department personnel from China, but to leave them to finish out their quarantine there. However, after that meeting, one of the attendees took it upon himself to order the immediate evacuation of State personnel from China and had the gall to brag about it. This contributed to the spread of COVID-19.

Let me give you one example: Medicaid, the state’s share of the program that provides health care for the old and needy. From day one, Cuomo told us that the counties were not paying their fair share. Then came the Corona Virus and, as usual, I called it wrong, brilliant prognosticator that I am. I mean, how can the counties and their hospitals be penalized just when they have to be spending money that they don’t have?
 But the budget does demand that the counties and the Big Kahuna, New York City, pick up a greater share of the Medicaid bill. For his part, Cuomo suggests that spending on the Medicaid program had gone out of control what with all the bells and whistles. Maybe he’s right but obviously, the affected localities were not going to fight with Cuomo who has become a national hero, so they’ve had to eat it.
 After all, hero that he is, Andrew is still Andrew.
 Take the Working Families Party, who had the nerve to primary Cuomo. He still hasn’t forgotten that one. He and his fellow Democratic leaders tried to load the game so that it would be much, much harder for them to get on the ballot. Naturally, they set up a phooey commission to “make the decision.” Well, the Working Families Party took them to court and won so, just as naturally, the power people decided to put it in the budget.
 In New York State, you will remember, the governor is allowed to put anything that ought to be done as separate statute into the budget.
 We should all be sick and tired of Trump and his Republican followers trying to load the elections by making voting harder and harder. Just when Andrew has people kissing his feet for being the antidote to Trump, he does something that is very reminiscent of The Big Orange. I just don’t get it. Cuomo is popular and a natural leader.

After the cold and dreary months of winter, I am always eager for spring and to decorate for the Easter season. For me, celebrating Easter and the joys of spring go hand in hand.      Once you make the decision to set a formal or informal table, then the fun can begin. We've become a disposable society where paper plates, cups and napkins are the norm for family gatherings. Consider using the opportunity to take out the fine china, crystal and flatware. If you don't own fine china, but would like to start your own collection, visit estate sales or antique malls. While you're searching for these goodies, keep your eyes open for ceramic bunnies, chicks and lambs. Vintage tablecloths, napkins and candle holders are often found for great prices.      For a semi-formal place setting, I have often used wicker chargers. Dollar stores offer so many unique items to "fill in the gaps" on the table. Consider small vine bird's nests, tiny Easter eggs to fill small baskets at each place setting and holiday-themed salt and pepper shakers. Fresh flowers are always appropriate to herald the arrival of spring!      For fun and informal meals, vibrant Fiestaware plates always bring compliments from my guests. If you don't want to purchase an entire set of dishes, neighborhood yard sales and estate sales are your friends. The best part of using Fiestaware (besides its bright colors) is the ease of mixing and matching. I've used pink, purple, robin's egg blue, green, orange and yellow all together for an Easter egg color-themed table.      If room allows, have a separate "kids' table." Children love the bright colors and, again, the dollar stores are a treasure trove of goodies for setting the perfect table for your youngest guests. Vinyl tablecloths that can be easily cleaned are perfect for the inevitable spills and drips. Melamine plates are suitable for the kids, along with plastic cups or glasses. Consider filling a large basket with plastic Easter eggs as your centerpiece. If time allows before the meal, let the kids decorate their own boiled and dyed egg to use as their place setting marker.      Don't forget about the serving pieces. Silver trays, vintage egg plates for stuffed eggs, cabbage shaped bowls for coleslaw and platters with a carrot motif all contribute to the beauty of your Easter table. Plan ahead and visit your local hobby or department stores the days after Easter. You'll find great bargains for next spring's family table.

 As of 4 p.m. Tuesday, there were 8,781 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Connecticut and 1,418 patients were currently hospitalized as a result of symptoms they were experiencing. The state said state laboratories have also confirmed that 335 deaths were associated to the coronavirus.
 Across Connecticut, more than 31,700 tests had been conducted as of Wednesday.
 According to data provided through the Connecticut Department of Public Health, cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in 159 of the state's 169 municipalities.

 Stamford has maintained the highest number of confirmed cases in the state, with 1,045 residents having tested positive by Wednesday afternoon. In eastern Connecticut, Stonington had 15 confirmed cases; Groton had 11; Ledyard had 4; Preston had 2; and Voluntown had 1.
 A total of 366 additional state residents have tested positive, but their addresses have not been validated, officials said.

Ralph Hasenhuttl says Southampton must forget about next month’s derby with fierce rivals Portsmouth and focus their full attention on Manchester United.
 The midweek Carabao Cup draw has created a buzz on the south coast, with Saints and Pompey set to resume their bitter rivalry for the first time in more than seven years.
 Southampton boss Hasenhuttl has been aware of the hostility which exists between Hampshire’s top two clubs since his first day at St Mary’s.
 But with three Premier League fixtures before the trip to Fratton Park, including Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off against United, the Austrian is keen for his players to concentrate on the present and avoid distractions.
 “I don’t know if our players are following this noise from the fans so much. I think for us the game against Man United is a very big one, an important one,” said Hasenhuttl.
 “They are really focused on what happens today and what they have to do for the next game and then this Portsmouth game is not really interesting for them at the moment.
 “There are some games that are very special for the fans and they are really looking forward for these games, but for us as a manager in the moment it’s not in our focus.
 “But I know that it’s very important for everybody here. I have heard this from the first day when I was here.”
 Southampton, who last faced League One Portsmouth in April 2012, picked up their first points of the campaign by beating Brighton last weekend.
 However, their preparations for the visit of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side have been far from smooth after wingers Nathan Redmond and Moussa Djenepo sustained injuries in Tuesday’s cup success at Fulham.
 United arrive on the south coast following an unconvincing start to the campaign which has seen them draw at Wolves and suffer a surprise home defeat to Crystal Palace.
 Hasenhuttl hopes his team can “turn the tables” on the 13-time Premier League champions after coming close to snatching a point in March’s 3-2 defeat at Old Trafford, and feels he has the personnel to put further pressure on Solskjaer.
 “We played, last season, very well in Old Trafford, we had a very good game there. In the end we lost but I think deserved more,” said Hasenhuttl.
 “Maybe we can turn the tables now. We are building up a little bit more self- confidence after the last two games with two clean sheets.
 “Even if we have a few injuries now, we have good subs. They are really looking forward to playing now.
 “It’s up to me to find the right balance and then I am sure that we have a squad on the pitch who can create problems for Manchester United.”
 Redmond (ankle) and Djenepo (muscular problem), who claimed the second-half goals in the 2-0 success at Brighton, are definitely unavailable, while striker Michael Obafemi (cramp) and left-back Ryan Bertrand (ankle) are doubtful and will be assessed.

BRUSSELS (AP) — Faced with a mounting coronavirus death toll and the prospect of a deep recession, European finance ministers have backed a major half- trillion-euro (about $550 billion) rescue package.
 But the agreement does little to paper over divisions about how best to tackle the impact of the coronavirus and pave the way for a return to normal life.
 Hard-hit countries like Italy and Spain have demanded funds for weeks as they’ve battled to save lives and keep their economies afloat. As of Friday, more than 64,000 Europeans had been killed by the disease — two thirds of the global toll — the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says.
 After a chaotic response when the virus first broke out in northern Italy, the European Union has taken unprecedented measures, and the new support program makes an extra 240 billion euros ($263 billion) available in cheap loans to pay health costs.
 EU state aid and border rules were already virtually dropped. Now, more money will be funneled into businesses facing bankruptcy and to help pay the wages of people on shorter working hours. Since the initial panic subsided, the 27 member countries have also begun sharing scarce medical equipment.
 Yet Europe’s leaders, who will hold talks again via video-conference on April 23 to take stock of the fight, no longer even try to hide the fact that the lack of solidarity exposed by the virus poses an existential threat.

Just under a month ago, sports in the United States were shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The NBA was the first American professional sports league to make the decision on March 11 after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. The following day MLB and the NHL announced they would also be postponing games. The leagues have been in a holding pattern ever since, as the virus has claimed more than 16,000 lives in America.
 The first updates given from MLB, the NBA and NHL was that their potential return dates would simply be pushed back even further. But this week, some leagues have been a bit more open about when and how games could possibly resume.
 This past Saturday, United States president Donald Trump met by phone with the commissioners of America's major sports to discuss the impact on their leagues. "I want fans back in the arenas," he said later in a White House briefing. "I think it's … whenever we're ready. As soon as we can, obviously. And the fans want to be back, too. They want to see basketball and baseball and football and hockey. They want to see their sports."
 While Trump is optimistic about US sports returning soon, NBA commissioner Adam Silver and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman do not share the same rosy outlook. Silver said on Monday the NBA would not be able to make any decisions about possibly completing the 2019-20 season until May.
 "Essentially, what I've told my folks over the last week is that we just should just accept that, at least for the month of April, we won't be in a position to make any decisions," Silver said in a conversation on the NBA's Twitter account. "And I don't think that necessarily means on May 1 we will be."
 Silver said the league is looking at several different scenarios for completing the season, determining if games would be played in NBA arenas or practice facilities, and if the regular season would be completed or if the playoffs would begin immediately. He admitted, though, that making any concrete plans right now is pointless.
 "Sitting here today, I know less than I did then [when the league was postponed last month]," he said.
 On Tuesday, Bettman acknowledged for the first time that completing the NHL regular season might not happen.
 "We understand that that may not be possible and that's why we're considering every conceivable alternative to deal with whatever the eventuality is," he told NBC Sports.
 The Stanley Cup playoffs were scheduled to begin on Wednesday, but it could be months before teams get back on the ice. Bettman also said the NHL is looking into playing games at neutral sites if teams are unable to play in their home markets due to the number of cases of the coronavirus there. Like Silver, Bettman stressed that nothing is finalised with so many unknowns with the pandemic.
 "Nothing's been ruled in, nothing's been ruled out," he said.
 While neither the NBA nor NHL have put a timeline on a potential return, a report on Monday said MLB was aiming for a possible start to the season in May. According to ESPN, MLB and the players' association proposed having all 30 teams playing games in Arizona in empty spring training stadiums at the Diamondbacks' Chase Field. The players and coaches would be isolated in hotels, only travelling to and from the ballparks. A day later, though, MLB refuted that report, insisting that no plans have been decided on how the season will begin.
 "While we have discussed the idea of staging games at one location as one potential option, we have not settled on that option or developed a detailed plan," the league said in a statement on Tuesday.
 The NFL regular season is still months away from kicking off, but there are still plenty of concerns about if it will start on time. Leading up to the start of the season there is training camp, offseason workout programs and the draft. The draft will go on as scheduled on April 23-25, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced on Monday, though in a much different format than it was originally conceptualised on a stage constructed in front of fountains at a lavish Las Vegas hotel.
 Goodell sent a memo to all 32 teams saying the draft will take place in a fully virtual format, as club personnel will be sequestered in their own homes, communicating with one another by phone or internet. Also as part of the memo, Goodell said league and club facilities would remain closed. Monday was supposed to be the start of the NFL's offseason workout program, but the league and the NFL Players Association are trying to devise a new plan to when they could begin, allowing teams to conduct classroom instructions and workouts on a virtual basis.
 Working remotely in isolation has been the norm throughout many cities in the United States for the past month. Professional sports, however, cannot be played in video chats and over e-mail.

Poland's government on Friday marked the 10th anniversary of the plane crash that killed President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others by demanding that Russia return the wreckage of the plane. Poland's Foreign Ministry said it had sent a diplomatic note to the Russian embassy in Warsaw calling on Moscow to “immediately surrender Poland's property.” “No norm of international law gives grounds for Russia's retention of Poland's property,” the ministry said.
 Poland has made similar demands in the past, and Russia has replied that it is keeping the wreckage of the Tupolev plane because of an ongoing investigation. The crash occurred as the Tu-154 air force jet carrying a high-level Polish delegation attempted to land in fog at a rudimentary airport near Smolensk, Russia.
 It was Poland's worst tragedy since World War II, killing not only the president and first lady, but many other top government and military officials. The tragedy strained already difficult relations with neighbor Russia.
 It has also created a deep sense of grievance that has shaped Polish political life since then. Today the government is directed — mostly from behind the scenes — by the late president's identical twin, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is chairman of the ruling conservative Law and Justice party.
 Kaczynski paid tribute to his twin and other victims at monuments to the victims in Warsaw, at the exact moment that the plane crashed on April 10, 2010. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and more than a dozen ruling party politicians also took part despite restrictions imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic that ban gatherings of more than two people.
 The fact that the delegation killed in the plane crash had been traveling to commemorate a World War II massacre of some 22,000 Polish officers by the Soviet Union deepened the sense of national tragedy. This year, Polish leaders had hoped to travel to Russia to mark the anniversary, but a government spokesman said Russia did not provide the Polish government with the logistical support needed to organize the visit.

Spain’s economy minister, Nadia Calviño, also hailed the agreement, but she told Cadena SER radio that Madrid will “continue working to establish in the mid-term a mechanism to share the European debt, the so-called coronabonds.”
 Similar differences are evident in approaches to exiting the coronavirus lockdown. Already, the Czech Republic is letting more retail stores resume business, while Austria will gradually start opening more shops next week.
 For most people, coronavirus symptoms clear up in two to three weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.
 EU leaders tasked the European Commission with coordinating an “exit strategy,” and as Austria and the Czech Republic moved it tried to rush out its action plan this week. But others warned that the Easter vacation, when people should stay inside, isn't the time to talk about easing quarantine.
 Spokesman Eric Mamer said it’s “quite a tricky issue because member states find themselves in different stages of the fight against the pandemic” but he suggested that the commission could go public with its plan if more countries move alone.
 In a deeply interconnected Europe, Brussels believes that any exit should take into account the virus’s spread throughout the EU, the capacity of health systems to cope with a possible second wave, the impact of any new border closures and the need to for countries to keep their partners informed.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Christians are commemorating Jesus’ crucifixion without the solemn church services or emotional processions of past years, marking Good Friday in a world locked down by the coronavirus pandemic.The chanting of a small group of clerics inside Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulcher echoed faintly through the heavy wooden doors, as a few people stopped and kneeled outside to pray. The centuries-old church, built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was crucified, buried and rose from the dead, is usually packed with pilgrims and tourists.Later, four monks in brown robes and blue surgical masks prayed at the stations of the cross along the Via Dolorosa, the ancient route through the Old City where Jesus is believed to have carried the cross before his execution at the hands of the Romans. It runs past dozens of souvenir shops, cafes and hostels, nearly all of which are closed.Franciscan friars retrace the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem's Old City on Friday after the traditional mass procession was called off amid coronavirus fears, in Jerusalem, Friday, April 10, 2020. Christians are commemorating Jesus' crucifixion without the solemn church services or emotional processions of past years, marking Good Friday in a world locked down by the coronavirus pandemic.In ordinary times, tens of thousands of pilgrims from around the world retrace Jesus' steps in the Holy Week leading up to Easter. But this year, flights are grounded and religious sites in the Holy Land are closed as authorities try to prevent the spread of the virus.James Joseph, a Christian pilgrim from Detroit dubbed "the Jesus guy" because he wears robes and goes about barefoot, lives near the Church of the Holy Sepulcher year-round. On Friday morning he had the plaza outside to himself. He said Good Friday has special meaning this year."The crucifixion is the saddest thing possible, and he felt what we feel right now," he said. "But thanks be to God. ... He rose from the dead and changed the world on Easter."The new virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can be spread by those who appear healthy. It can cause severe illness and death in some patients, particularly the old and infirm.In Rome, the torch-lit Way of the Cross procession at the Colosseum is a highlight of Holy Week, drawing large crowds of pilgrims, tourists and locals. It's been cancelled this year, along with all other public gatherings in Italy, which is battling one of the worst outbreaks.The virus has killed more than 18,000 people in Italy and over 95,000 worldwide, according to data gathered by Johns Hopkins University.Instead of presiding over the Way of the Cross procession, Pope Francis will lead a Good Friday ceremony in St. Peter's Square without the public.Ten people — five from the Vatican's health office and five from a prison in Padua, in northern Italy, where infections are particularly widespread — will participate in the procession, which will circle several times around the obelisk in St. Peter's Square.On display in the square will be a wooden crucifix, famed for being carried in a procession during the plague that ravaged Rome in the early 16th century.In Paris, a ceremony was held in the charred and gutted interior of Notre Dame Cathedral, which was nearly destroyed by fire a year ago. The ceremony was closed to the public because of the virus lockdown and because the structure is not deemed safe for parishioners.Archbishop Michel Aupetit and three other clergymen wore hard hats as they entered the damaged cathedral before taking them off for the ceremony. Standing before a large cross and beneath a gaping hole in the roof, they sang, prayed and venerated a crown of thorns that survived the flames.Experts point to data that shows the virus has already spread rapidly in countries that are coming out of summer, like Australia.Classical musician Renaud Capuçon played violin, the mournful notes echoing off the walls and pillars. Actors Judith Chemla and Philippe Torreton delivered readings, and Chemla sang a moving rendition of "Ave Maria." All three wore white protective overalls.The bishop said the ceremony, which was broadcast live, showed that "life is still here," even as the pandemic is "spreading death and paralyzing us."In the Philippines, Asia's bastion of Catholicism, masses and other solemn gatherings have been put on hold, including folk rituals that feature real- life crucifixions and usually draw thousands of tourists and penitents. The annual procession of the "Black Nazarene," a centuries-old statue of Jesus, through downtown Manila, has also been canceled.Churchgoers have been told to stay home and remember Jesus' suffering through family prayers, fasting and by watching masses and religious shows on TV or online.For Josille Sabsal, it's a test of faith. The 30-year-old Catholic missionary tried to replicate an altar in her Manila home by setting up a laptop, a crucifix and small statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary on a table."It's different, because the priest is on a screen," she said. "When the internet lags, the mass suddenly gets cut off and you have to look for another YouTube video.""I miss that moment in church when you say, 'Peace be with you,' to complete strangers and they smile back," she added.The Rev. Flavie Villanueva, a former drug addict who ministers in Manila's slums, got special permission to celebrate Mass on Thursday for 73 homeless people in a college basketball court. They wore masks, stayed more than an arm's length apart, and there was no singing.Villanueva said he's sad to see the churches emptied out, but hopes it will help people to renew their faith."We are asked to go back and rediscover where the church in our lives first started, and that's in the family," he said.___Associated Press writers Frances D’Emilio in Rome, John Leicester in Paris and Jim Gomez in Manila contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

 “Coming over the hill, you could see the flames from about a mile away,” Katie said. “I felt like it was time to make a choice: how am I going to respond to this? Am I going to be angry and upset, or am I going to stand and know that it’s going to be OK, that God’s going to take care of this?”

JERUSALEM -- On an eerie Good Friday in Jerusalem, a handful of Franciscan friars - some wearing face masks - commemorated Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection along a Via Dolorosa in lockdown and empty of pilgrims.
 They walked the Stations of the Cross to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the centerpiece of Christian celebrations of Easter where, in a sparsely attended service, a call earlier went out for prayers for victims of the coronavirus.
 COVID-19 has killed close to 100,000 worldwide. It has infected over 10,000 in Israel, with 92 fatalities, and there have been 266 cases and two deaths in the Palestinian territories.
 "We are celebrating Good Friday, the commemoration of the death of Jesus, in very difficult circumstances," the Latin apostolic administrator in the Holy Land, Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said outside the church.
 "So it is important in a way, in this place, where this happened, that we can …be united in the heart, in prayer, for all those who are suffering and dying."
 Holding a mask and flanked by clerics, Pizzaballa spoke to Reuters before conducting a restricted service in the ancient sandstone church revered by Christians worldwide as the site of Jesus' final hours.
 Soon afterwards, the sound of singing and prayers emerged from a window high up in the building's wall.
 Easter is the most important festival in the Christian calendar. Roman Catholics this year celebrate it on April 12 and the Greek Orthodox church a week later.
 The Holy Sepulchre was closed to the public weeks ago because of Israeli restrictions on public gatherings, but was opened on Good Friday specifically for the archbishop's service, attended by a few clerics.
 The Christian denominations that share custody of the Holy Sepulchre face closures unprecedented in living memory, as do Jewish and Muslim leaders in a city that has sites sacred to all three faiths.
 Passover, Easter and Ramadan all fall this month.
 The four friars began their procession - a spectacle normally witnessed by huge crowds of pilgrims and tourists - down the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem's walled Old City shortly before noon.
 The group included Father Ibrahim Faltas and Father Francesco Patton, the custodian of the Holy Land for the Roman Catholic church, who stopped and prayed at the 14 stations that mark events leading up to Jesus' burial.
 Police fined several journalists for getting too close to the procession, and dispersed a small group of Palestinian Christians who had flouted restrictions and marched their own large wooden cross through the city.
 "As you can see, it's calm," Faltas said. "Four people doing the Via Dolorosa ritual, for the first time in history." (Additional reporting by Ismail Khader Writing by Rami Ayyub; editing by John Stonestreet)

But a lack of confirmed cases does not necessarily mean the virus isn't present in the community. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont warned earlier this week that the state's first peak could "still be weeks away."
 In a press conference, Lamont had provided an updated analysis that estimated different peak infection times across the state. The data, which was compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suggested the peak of the coronavirus outbreak is still a few weeks away for Fairfield County, more than a month away for New Haven County and may not hit the eastern part of the state until as late as June.
 Stephen Mansfield, health director for Ledge Light Health District, urged local residents to remain on alert in the region and to assume everyone they come across has already contracted the disease.
 "The important message for the public is these are the number of known cases in each town, not the level of infection impacting the community," Mansfield said. "Residents should assume anyone they come in contact with outside the house is carrying the virus."
 Urgo said the town is prepared to hunker down for several more weeks and is continuing to think outside the box in order to move forward with town business while protecting both employees and local residents and business owners. The town has made a shift to "virtual operations," he said, and members of the Economic Development Commission have worked to promote local businesses that have remained open.
 The town has recently started pushing resources from the Small Business Administration through social media as well, an effort to aid those locally who have been impacted by the shutdown.
 Urgo said he knows that for many residents, it is getting harder to stay at home and there may be a desire to go out. His advice? Don't, unless you absolutely have to.
 "We know this is hard, but what we are experiencing right now is unprecedented," Urgo said. "We will continue to be a conduit for information.
 "What we want is that when this is all over, and it will be over at some point, our businesses and their customers will not only be able to come back but thrive, and we will be able to quickly get things back to normal," he said.

Table leaders Borussia Dortmund will be without winger Thorgan Hazard as they head to the capital to face Union Berlin for the first time in Bundesliga history.
 The 26-year-old Belgian suffered a rib injury during Dortmund’s 3-1 win over Cologne and will be sidelined for several weeks.
 Hazard’s absence could create an opening for summer signing Julian Brandt, who has impressed as a substitute this season so far and would be an obvious choice to fill the vacancy in the starting XI.
 BVB manager Lucien Favre is not underestimating his newly-promoted opponents, saying in a pre-match press conference: “I’ve watched the new Union team; they have a few new players, are well organised, have a lot of power and are very athletic.”
 English winger Jadon Sancho, who has just been named in Gareth Southgate’s England squad for the upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers, is likely to feature alongside Spanish striker Paco Alcacer – both having scored in Dortmund’s opening two games.
 Midfielder Axel Witsel has suffered an injury to his adductor is therefore ruled out.
 Union Berlin will have to raise their game to challenge the Black and Yellows, having drawn at Augsburg last time and suffering a resounding 4-0 loss to Leipzig prior to that.
 Head coach Urs Fischer did not sound defeated in a pre-match press conference however, highlighting the similarities in the two teams’ style of play.
 “When it comes to speed and transitions, both teams are similar,” he said.
 “In movement up front, they are very similar teams. We want to improve on the aspects from Leipzig against Borussia Dortmund.
 “It’s the same as we’ve said before, we want to develop and learn from our mistakes. You take things from the last game, then observe the individual development of the players.”
 Fischer will be without centre-back Keven Schlotterbeck, who serves a two- match suspension for his challenge on Augsburg’s Florian Niederlechner.
 Fellow centre-back Florian Hubner will miss out through injury, with midfielder Grischa Promel sidelined for the same reason.
 Nineteen-year-old Maurice Opfermann Arcones is still out due to illness, whereas midfielder Christian Gentner has returned to training and could participate.

The goal of the unemployment insurance program, which provides partial wage replacement to workers out of work through no fault of their own, is to provide economic stability to not just individuals and their families but to support the entire state. Unemployment benefits ensure bills are paid, families are fed and local businesses are supported during times of economic contraction.
 Gov. Tony Evers, through an emergency order, has taken multiple steps to provide direct assistance to individuals out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He waived work search requirements to ensure individuals stay attached to their previous employers and loosened the "able and available to work requirement" to extend benefits to more workers impacted by the virus.
 The federal government has also taken multiple steps to assist the unemployed, and Department of Workforce Development unemployment insurance staff are preparing to implement the new requirements as soon as they receive final guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor.
 But the only way to get much-needed financial assistance into the hands of Wisconsinites faster is to repeal the one-week waiting period for unemployment insurance benefits. Under current state law, workers do not receive any benefits for the first week they are out of work. Prior to the pandemic, more than 40 states had a one-week waiting period for benefits. According to recent reports, fewer than eight states still have the requirement in place.
 Wisconsin is one of those states, but we don't have to be. While the one-week wait hurts our state's families and economy in a normal situation, it will hurt even more now. Once available to claimants, the federal government's Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (an additional $600 per month for those receiving state unemployment) will be available for the first week of a claim but only if that state does not have a one-week waiting period. Foregoing the first week of needed state and Federal benefits can easily be avoided through legislative action. The time to act is now. Out-of-work Wisconsinites don't have weeks to pay their bills. Essential Wisconsin businesses don't have weeks to make their payroll.
 Gov. Evers called on the Legislature on March 17 to pass legislation to repeal the one-week waiting period. The governor and Democrats in the Legislature have continued to champion this common-sense measure. I was encouraged to see this proposal gain bipartisan support and now ask that the Legislature act swiftly to guide the law change through both houses and get it on Gov. Evers' desk as soon as possible. The stability of Wisconsin families and our economy depends on timely legislative action.

Look, what’s happening on a global scale is extremely serious. Watching friends not be able to sleep because they’re worried about they gonna make ends meet, reading stories of people being laid off and not being able to collect unemployment and seeing the fear that this pandemic is causing does a lot on the soul. Then, of course, there are all these deaths and the concern for my parents, who due to their age, are some of the most vulnerable to this virus.

Felony charges have been dismissed against a professional snowboarder accused of driving under the influence during an accident that left one man with serious injuries.
 Mohave County Superior Court Judge Rick Lambert approved a motion this week to dismiss the case against 20-year-old California resident Cody K. Potter without prejudice, following a successful request by Potter’s defense to suppress toxicology evidence against the defendant.
 Potter was arrested Oct. 20 after Lake Havasu City Police officers were received reports of a vehicle accident at the 700 block of London Bridge Road. Paramedics were already treating an injured motorcyclist at the scene when officers arrived, according to the police report, and Potter was seated with an acquaintance. According to police, Potter appeared to be “extremely” intoxicated when officers attempted to speak to him.

ATLANTA -- University System of Georgia (USG) students being forced to take classes online this semester because of the coronavirus pandemic got some welcome news Thursday.
   
 The system's Board of Regents is expected to vote next week to hold the line on tuition during the coming school year, based on the recommendation of Chancellor Steve Wrigley.
   
 "One of the University System of Georgia's top priorities is affordability, and that has never been more important than now for our students and their families," Wrigley said Thursday. "It is more critical than ever for our institutions to provide a quality education while maintaining the affordability and accessibility that helps more Georgians attain a college degree and find success in the workforce."
   
 Tuition at the system's 26 colleges and universities went up 2.5% last August for the current school year. But if the regents approve Wrigley's recommendation next week, it will mark the third time in the last five years there has been no tuition increase.
   
 Overall, tuition during the last five years would have risen just 0.9%.

 University system officials frequently tout Georgia's public colleges and universities as one of the best financial deals in the South. Among the 16 states that make up the Southern Regional Education Board, Georgia charges the fourth lowest in-state tuition and fees for undergraduates at four-year institutions.
   
 "USG continues to do all we can to ensure the cost of our colleges and universities remains among the lowest of our peers," said Regent Sachin Shailendra, the board's chairman. "I support the recommendation of Chancellor Wrigley and know that the board will support and approve it at our meeting on Tuesday."
   
 Wrigley is proposing a small number of fee increases for the coming school year. Those will be limited to debt payments or contractual obligations, according to a news release.

 My dog is squirrel obsessed.
 This is not as much of an issue now that we moved to the city, but it was a big problem when we lived in the suburbs where there were a kajillion squirrels. I had to imagine he was genetically wired for this because he did not have any kind of traumatic squirrel experience as a puppy that would cause him to have a squirrel vendetta. Of course they may have ganged up on him when I wasn't looking and pelted him with acorns or something just for laughs, and I never knew about it. He was actually traumatized by a giant woodchuck that lived under our deck years ago, so maybe he thought all squirrels were small woodchucks and this was his way of working through his issues. This was not such a stretch considering the first time I saw the woodchuck, I thought it was a beaver. Maybe wildlife idiocy runs in the family.
 Whatever the reason, the dog was clearly not a fan of squirrels and would sit by the deck door watching the backyard like some kind of squirrel mercenary. Neither sleep nor hunger would tear him from his post unless of course he needed a nap or heard the sound of food accidentally dropping on the kitchen floor. When a squirrel appeared, he would growl menacingly and finally erupt into a fit of hysterical barking until I let him outside to chase the man- eating squirrel over the fence or up a tree.
 This happened ... no kidding ... every five minutes.
 Like I said, there were a lot of squirrels out there.
 In the city, however, there were not that many squirrels around, so the dog took to hating pigeons instead. I have to admit, I was kind of with him on that. At least the squirrels didn't poop on your head from above.
 Unbeknownst to me, though, the pigeon thing had the potential to be an even bigger problem. In the suburbs, I could just let the dog run wild in our backyard to chase squirrels. (He never caught any, but I think it was just the thrill of the chase). But in the city, the dog was on a leash. And I didn't learn about his pigeon obsession until I had him out for a walk. As we strolled down the street, we came across a flock of pigeons just hanging out on the sidewalk, doing their pigeony things.
 When the dog saw them, he lost his mind.
 He lurched after the pigeons, dragging me behind him like a piece of toilet paper on the bottom of your shoe. And then the pigeons did something that squirrels don't do. They flew. Thinking he could follow them, the dog flew, too ... for one second. Just long enough for me to also fly ... into a tree.
 Had I not gone face first into a tree, I might have been impressed that:   a) the dog thought he could fly,   b) all the pigeons got away, and   c) my face found one of only three trees on the whole street.
 As I sat in the dirt next to the tree, the dog came over to me. He did not try to comfort me or come to my assistance in any way. Instead, he looked at the tree with some obvious interest.
 I shook my head at him.

In my book, I analyzed the political, economic and demographic predictors of each type of policy reform from 2000 to 2014.

"Right now we've seen some cases out of China where there is a supposed secondary infection. What's hard about that without really good testing and antibody testing, is that did they truly get a second infection or is it still the first infection that's lasting longer in them? Only time will tell. Right now, from the way the virus is designed and what scientists are saying publicly, is we do believe it is a one-and-done situation. But we don't have proof of that yet, so we have to act very carefully going forward with those recommendations," says Dr. Rai.

 In response to Lowell Greenbaum's assertion to the contrary (\"Trump weak and inept,\" April 7), President Trump has demonstrated true leadership on a daily basis despite the coordinated efforts of the socialist globalists in the government and media.
 Dr. Anthony Fauci told Newsmax TV in January that the U.S. had no cause for alarm about COVID-19. Months later, he considers it imperative to close down every state. During a White House meeting in January, it was decided not to evacuate State Department personnel from China, but to leave them to finish out their quarantine there. However, after that meeting, one of the attendees took it upon himself to order the immediate evacuation of State personnel from China and had the gall to brag about it. This contributed to the spread of COVID-19.
 Gov Andrew Cuomo's New York City cases of COVID-19 increased dramatically when a woman returned from Iran in early March. This was enabled in spite of a travel ban thanks to lower courts litigating against a Supreme Court decision.
 As far as medicines are concerned, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been around for years and reportedly have no side effects. They have been used successfully in Australia, Britain, France and the U.S.in treating COVID-19. Thanks to President Bill Clinton, about 97% of U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturing capability was moved from Puerto Rico to China, making the U.S. almost totally dependent upon China for our pharmaceutical requirements.
 No, President Trump is a proven leader and has done remarkably well in spite of the socialist globalists in government.
 It is my earnest prayer that Jehovah GOD will give President Trump - and all those in leadership positions who love America - the wisdom. integrity and tenacity of purpose to prevail over this ordeal and continue to Make America Great Again!

Luton picked up their first home win of the Sky Bet Championship season to heap more misery on Huddersfield with a 2-1 triumph at Kenilworth Road.
 The hosts made it three victories in a week after triumphs at Barnsley and then Cardiff in the Carabao Cup, while the result means the Terriers are still without a victory since being relegated from the Premier League last season and sit second bottom in the table.
 Luton had the first attempt of note, James Collins’ blast turned over the bar by on-loan Liverpool keeper Kamil Grabara, who then managed to collect Kazenga LuaLua’s low cross.
 Andrew Shinnie tried his luck from 20 yards, curling over the top, before the visitors created a fine chance in the 38th minute, as Adama Diakhaby did superbly to beat left-back James Bree and then race away from Sonny Bradley.
 His cross was met by Karlan Grant, only for the Terriers’ leading marksman to poke disappointingly wide from close range.
 The deadlock was then broken just two minutes into the second period, as a free-kick was not properly cleared by the Hatters.
 Terence Kongolo played a one-two to break down the left of the hosts’ penalty area and cross low for Grant to turn home from close range.
 He almost had a second, shooting straight at home stopper Simon Sluga after a quick break by Huddersfield.
 The Hatters were on level terms in the 57th minute, though, as visiting skipper Christopher Schindler caught Collins as he went to clear his lines, referee Andy Davies awarding a spot-kick that Collins expertly fired past Grabara.
 Collins could not quite reach Harry Cornick’s low cross, while Shinnie fizzed one over as the hosts looked to retake the lead.
 They did just that in the 64th minute when Shinnie cut back in on his left foot and curled a sublime 22-yard effort beyond Grabara and into the corner.
 Luton lived dangerously at times in the final moments, home keeper Sluga out to save well from substitute Steve Mounie after it looked like fellow substitute Elias Kachunga had been clearly pulled back by Sonny Bradley in the build-up.
 In the closing stages, the Terriers could not quite fashion a presentable opportunity, Mounie flicking a header wide and then Grant unable to get enough on his effort from a flicked cross.
 The Hatters held on though, to climb up to 15th in the table, and they can now go into the international break in high spirits following an excellent start to life in the Championship.

The worldwide number of fatalities from the novel coronavirus pandemic rose to 96,344 on Friday, according to a tally compiled by AFP at 1630 IST from official sources. More than 1,605,250 declared cases have been registered in 193 countries and territories since the epidemic first emerged in China in December. Of these cases, at least 331,000 are now considered recovered.
 The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are only testing the most serious cases.
 Italy, which recorded its first death in late February, has had the most fatalities with 18,279 from 143,626 infections. The death toll in the United States is the second highest, at 16,686 from 466,299 infections -- the largest number of cases in the world.
 Spain has recorded 15,843 fatalities from 157,022 infections. France has reported 12,210 deaths and 117,749 infections followed by Britain with 7,978 deaths and 65,077 cases. China \-- excluding Hong Kong and Macau \-- has to date declared 3,336 deaths and 81,907 cases, with 77,455 recoveries.
 Since 1900 GMT on Thursday, Yemen announced their first coronavirus-linked deaths. Europe has listed 826,389 cases and 67,247 deaths to date, the US and Canada together have 486,992 cases with 17,212 deaths, Asia 130,415 cases and 4,603 deaths, the Middle East 91,327 cases and 4,493 deaths, Latin America and the Caribbean 50,589 cases with 2,090 deaths, Africa 12,260 cases with 640 deaths and Oceania 7,282 cases with 59 deaths.
