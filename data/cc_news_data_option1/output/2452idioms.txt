CHICAGO — A federal judge on Monday ordered the release from prison of an alleged organized crime enforcer who is said to have health issues that place him at heightened risk from coronavirus.
 Mario Rainone, 65, has spent nearly half of his life in prison for extorting borrowers with death threats and throwing a grenade onto a theater roof in an effort to take over the business, among other crimes. He was serving time for gun possession.
 Rainone asked for release to home confinement last month, saying prostate cancer, liver disease and heart problems make him susceptible to COVID-19. Court records show U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber rejected prosecutors’ objections and granted Rainone’s request, ordering prison officials to release him for time served.

While making posters and discussing appropriate outfits for the June 6 Athens Anti-Discrimination Movement rally, University of Georgia graduate Julia Spreng and senior Isabelle Heckler made a spur-of-the-moment decision—to create a QR code that could be worn on the back of her black T-shirt for people to scan.
 The QR code T-shirt was linked to the section of the Black Lives Matter website with ways to help. Spreng decided to use this website for the QR code since it condensed helpful and reliable resources onto a T-shirt.
 Spreng and Heckler attended the rally in their QR T-shirts, which fellow rally-goers gravitated towards.

Megan disclosed the scenario and added, "I did 'work' (me pretending to know how to hold a wrench) on one of Michael's Ferraris during one of the audition scenes. It was at the Platinum Dunes studio parking lot, there were several other crew members and employees present and I was at no point undressed or anything similar." The actress also went on to add that "there are many names that deserve to be going viral in the cancel culture right now." However, she retorted that Michael Bay was not one of them. "When it comes to my direct experiences with Michael and Steven Spielberg for that manner, I was never assaulted or preyed upon in what I felt was a sexual manner," Megan wrote.
