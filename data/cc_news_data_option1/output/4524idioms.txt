Given that the star has to be in the best of health for their upcoming mandatory military service, the statement read that Suga decided to treat his condition once and for all and has decided to slow down and heal. &quot;Suga also felt that it was important for him to restore himself to good health to prepare for his mandatory military service as well as his post-service musical career. After extensive discussion with the company, the decision was made to undergo the surgical procedure. Following the surgery, Suga will be unable to participate in most official activities so that he may fully focus on his recovery. Once doctors determine that the site of the operation has healed sufficiently, Suga will begin physical therapy so that he can ultimately return to the stage healthy and fully recovered.

FREETOWN -- Sawmill operator Paul Darling of East Freetown has been named the Massachusetts Wood Producer of the Year by the Massachusetts Forest Alliance.
 Darling, 68, and his family operate Gurney's Saw Mill in East Freetown, a 150-year-old family business now in its 6th generation. The Gurney Saw Mill produces lumber used for local construction, as well as for wholesale markets. The business has 8 full time employees, including Paul's son, Jon, and daughter, Jennifer Durant.
 Paul Darling began working at the mill in 1969 for his uncle, Merton Gurney, and he and his wife, Sharlene, purchased the business in 1993. The mill buys logs from local loggers and land clearers, and saws them into lumber and beams. The principal species sawed is white pine, with some red and white oak, hemlock and cedar also sawed when available. The mill includes both planing and dry kiln operations.
 Over the time the Darlings have operated the mill, they have increased production considerably and upgraded most of the operations to be more efficient. Wood produced at the mill is bought by local homeowners for projects, by shed and barn companies and contractors, by boat builders, and by wholesale dealers for pallet and crating parts. Demand for the mill's lumber has been high since the coronavirus hit due to homeowners doing more projects and seeking locally produced materials.
 The Douglas B. Cook Wood Producer of the Year Award is presented annually to a timber harvester, sawmill operator, or forest products professional who exemplifies the late Doug Cook's spirit of innovation and leadership in the industry. The award was presented on Saturday at MFA's virtual annual meeting.
 The Massachusetts Forest Alliance represents woodland owners, foresters, timber harvesters and forest products businesses and advocates for a strong, sustainable local forest economy. For more information about MFA, see www.massforestalliance.org

Paris, Nov 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Nov, 2020 ) :The novel coronavirus has killed at least 1,235,148 people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1100 GMT on Friday.
 At least 48,707,780 cases of coronavirus have been registered. Of these, at least 31,945,500 are now considered recovered.
 The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections.
 Many countries are testing only symptomatic or the most serious cases.
 On Thursday, 8,875 new deaths and 608,869 new cases were recorded worldwide.
 Based on latest reports, the countries with the most new deaths were the United States with 1,226 new deaths, followed by India with 670 and Brazil with 630.
 The United States remains the worst-affected country with 234,944 deaths from 9,610,967 cases. At least 3,781,751 people have been declared recovered.
 After the US, the hardest-hit countries are Brazil with 161,736 deaths from 5,612,319 cases, India with 124,985 deaths from 8,411,724 cases, Mexico with 93,772 deaths from 949,197 cases, and the United Kingdom with 48,120 deaths from 1,123,197 cases.

Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.
 Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15, industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.
 In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners--China and the US.

I've had this light therapy lamp for almost 2 weeks and I'm loving it! I appreciate the 3 levels of brightness and the timer. It's so easy to use. I do it reading in the morning or when using the treadmil. It's just a touch for on/off and the timer in 10 min increments is great. That has helped me in the morning with time management. It's just the right size for portability and big enough to get a good amount of light. I don't think I would like a bigger size therapy light. Further time will tell, but since using it every morning for an avarage of 10 to 20 min, I've noticed a difference in mood and wakefulness. This will be my favorite thing I've bought this year.

The Communist Party of India (CPI) on Thursday blamed the State police for the “wanton and reccurrent” killing of Maoists in Kerala.
 CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran said the law enforcement spilt the blood of Maoists wilfully to claim Central funds for combating armed insurgency. He said the role of the police was to identify Maoists, gather evidence against them, and arrest the insurgents. The government should not allow the police to act as judge and executioner.
 The CPI State Council adopted a resolution urging the government to rein in special police forces operating with unbridled freedom against Maoists in the forests of north Kerala.
 Mr. Rajendran said the shooting of Maoist Velmurugan in Wayanad forests recently had all the markings of an extrajudicial killing. None of the Thunderbolt commandos involved in the “encounter” had sustained any injuries. Elected representatives who visited the locality learned from local people and other sources that Velmurgan had not fired his weapon.
 ## Magisterial inquiry
 Mr. Rajendran demanded that the government hold a magisterial inquiry into the incident. He also asked the administration make public the findings of magisterial inquiries into earlier Maoist killings.
 Maoists posed no threat to Kerala. The CPI was against left-wing extremism and armed insurgency. However, it did not believe that eliminating Maoists in cold blood was a solution. The Left was in power in Kerala. The deliberate killing of Maoists would only serve to erode its political stature.
 Kerala did not face left extremism on the scale perhaps witnessed in Chattisgarh or Jharkhand, the CPI said.

This would have already been a difficult enough game even if Scunthorpe had built a good, fluid start to the season with lots of momentum. But that very clearly hasn’t been the case. They have conceded at least four goals in three successive home games (in all competitions) for the first time in the club’s history.
 United have also have had their previously scheduled three league games all postponed, so they will inevitably be rusty. Unlike Solihull, who have had plenty of match practice in them across recent weeks.
 And of course, we know the reason behind these postponements was because of The Iron’s severe Covid outbreak. Will everyone be back and available for selection, (and fully fit), for Sunday’s game? I certainly have my doubts.
 These doubts have been confirmed by the numerous rumours that Kevin van Veen is being rushed back for Sunday’s game. Would that really be happening if Scunthorpe had lots of alternative options beyond the Dutchman? You would assume not – but his goals were absolutely crucial in last season’s disappointing campaign, so Neil Cox and co will be hoping for a similar impact.

KINGSTON - If Pamela Cluff-McDevitt tells you something about the game of soccer you'd best listen to what she has say. She definitely knows what she's talking about.
 Before Cluff-McDevitt was a Kingston Youth Soccer Association board member and a youth team coach, the 40-year-old native of the town was a tremendously talented soccer player herself. How good you ask? Good enough that last month the Fairfield University graduate was chosen for the Metro Athletic Atlantic Conference's 40th Anniversary All-Star team.
 "I was honored to be selected with the level of talented players that also made the list. That's 40 years of some very good soccer players," she said. "I'm happy that two of my Fairfield teammates as well as a couple of players and a coach from the program were chosen as well."
 Cluff-McDevitt played center midfield in high school at Notre Dame Academy of Hingham as well as at Fairfield. She described herself as not really a flashy player but she usually "found my way to get where I needed to be on the field. I got a lot of assists and I enjoyed putting the ball at the feet of my teammates."
 One of her favorite college memories found her as the one getting the goal. It was her freshman year in 1998 and Fairfield was locked in a double-overtime nail-biter with Loyola with the winner taking home the MAAC Championship. I'll let Cluff-McDevitt take the story from here.
 "I had a free kick from the top of the box, about 18 yards out and I scored the goal. Right foot to the top corner of the net," she said. "The amazing thing is I scored again the next year on a similar shot against the same team."
 Cluff-McDevitt said the time at NDA-Hingham was a large help in getting her ready for what would come at her down the road. "Notre Dame's a great school for academics with a very good soccer program. We put together some talented teams and played really strong teams. I think the entire package prepared me for what would come next (at Fairfield)."
 Cluff-McDevitt is second on Fairfield's list for career goals (36) and third in points (88). She won MAAC Player of the Year twice (1999, 2000) and was a three-time All-MAAC First Team selection. She was the MAAC Tournament MVP as a sophomore and helped her team to two conference titles and a pair of NCAA tournament appearances over her four years at the Connecticut college.
 She was inducted into Fairfield's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011.
 "Those college years were an awesome time for me. I'd love to go back and experience it all again," Cluff-McDevitt said. "I had great teammates and coaches and an opportunity to see some of the world when the team traveled to New Zealand and Australia. A couple of my teammates were from New Zealand so were able to travel there and play against some club teams."
 Cluff-McDevitt owns a screen printing business in Kingston, Firefly Specialty Printing. With twin boys and a girl playing in the KYSA, soccer's still a big part of her life.
 "I love coaching the kids. It's a blast and it keeps me around the game. I still see a lot of familiar faces around the soccer field," Cluff-McDevitt said.

In the cryptocurrency industry, there are currently two hot trends. On the one hand, there is DeFi, or decentralized finance. On the other, there are decentralized exchanges. Both segments intertwine for many different reasons, yet they are also very different from one another, DeFi Needs Decentralized Exchanges The ongoing growth of decentralized finance has not gone by unnoticed. There are dozens of different projects, all of which offer their own native token. The tokens are offered to liquidity providers as an incentive. However, these tokens do not have any value on their own, unless they can be traded on the open market. It is at this point where decentralized exchanges play an increasing role of importance. A lot of DeFi tokens are best acquired shortly after their launch. That is, assuming a trader or speculator wants to make money from the token as quickly as possible. Most of these tokens are speculative in nature, with most traders not caring too much for the fundamentals of these coins. Without decentralized exchanges - platforms such as Uniswap, 1Inch, Tokenlon, SushiSwap, JustSwap, and others - obtaining DeFi tokens would prove incredibly difficult. More specifically, users would have to provide liquidity to these DeFi platforms to get the tokens, as there would be no other avenue to explore. One also has to acknowledge that, without DEXes, trading DeFi tokens would be a nightmare more often than not. Granted, there are some centralized exchanges that pay attention to listing new DeFi tokens. All of these platforms focus on legitimate projects, rather than just listing everything that comes their way.. These are primarily smaller trading platforms, but the likes of MXC, Binance, and even Coinbase cannot be ignored either. Eventually, the "cream of the crop" will find its way to centralized trading platforms. By the time this happens, its value may have exploded or collapsed already, though. The Rug Pull Issue Whereas decentralized exchanges facilitate DeFi token trading at an early stage, it is not an ideal situation either. Every benefit comes with a drawback, especially in the cryptocurrency space. There is no "free lunch" for anyone in this industry. As far as DeFi trading is concerned, the so-called "rug pulls" are becoming a lot more apparent in recent months. When a rug pull occurs, two outcomes can be observed. First of all, it is likely the token will no longer have any liquidity to speak of, making it impossible for speculators to sell their assets. Another possible outcome is how the creator of the token dumps the asset's price to $0, or close to it. When doing so, the creator will often drain any remaining liquidity from the trading pair on decentralized exchanges as well. Rug pulls are very nasty, but unfortunately, all too common these days. In fact, one could state that decentralized exchanges facilitate this behavior. There are no "verifications" to carry out, and as such, no repercussions for this type of predatory behavior either. No Trading Volume Competition Going by the current statistics on CoinGecko, there is a genuine lack of DeFi token trading volume. More specifically, the DeFi volume - compared to global cryptocurrency trading volumes - is just 0.9%. This means less than 1 in 100 trades is for DeFi tokens. Such a statistic will not instill much confidence in decentralized finance overall. Comparing the DEX trading volume to regular exchanges, there is no real sense of competition either. Decentralized exchanges tend to generate $500 million in daily volume on average. Centralized exchanges will, combined, often generate over $45 billion. Decentralized platforms are in a very different league in terms of numbers, users, and overall appeal. Cross-Chain Liquidity is the Next Frontier One potential way to make DEXes seem more appealing is by tapping into cross- chain liquidity and markets. One of the new platforms I keep my eye on, Chocoswap, shows what needs to change in this industry sooner rather than later. Instant transactions and low fees on a cross-chain asset exchange are things enthusiasts of all stature are actively looking for. Personally, I would like to see a lot more of these developments take place in the future. Unlike other DEXes, it leverages a dual-token economic model through a utility token and a governance token. It is crucial for traders to distinguish between the two. Offering one token that "suits all purposes" is clearly the wrong approach in my book. Having separate solutions to achieve completely different goals can potentially help lower barriers to entry. What really stands out to me is the ability to tap into different blockchains for liquidity. No decentralized exchange has been able to provide such functionality, even though it is clear as day there needs to be far more interoperability in this industry. In a way, Chocoswap positions itself as a DEX and DeFi solution rolled into one. While I have high expectations personally, it remains to be seen if this model is viable. Closing Thoughts Both decentralized finance and decentralized exchanges offer something the cryptocurrency industry can benefit from. At the same time, both concepts are entwined so closely, it almost makes one way of exploring either option. DeFi has started to get a bad name of sorts, primarily due to the growing number of rug pulls. As these tokens are primarily traded on DEXes, those platforms have to contend with worsening public perception as well. At the same time, this rather negative outlook on both industries will not remain in place. It is my firm belief that both DeFi and DEX platforms can help transform the cryptocurrency industry for the better. During the initial stage - which we are in right now - there will always be growing pains and kinks to work out. Given enough time, these concerns can all be overcome and the industry will be better off for it.

Given that Mowbray still faces the prospect of a double-figure absentee list on Saturday, grinding out results is of the essence. If Tuesday proved anything - despite its tedious nature - it was that Rovers can and will throw their bodies on the line to ensure a result.
 On Saturday, they will need more of that. Mark Warburton's outfit look to have found form at the worst possible time from a Rovers perspective and will be buoyed by Mowbray's personnel woes. On paper, this is a fixture Rovers would fancy themselves as heavy favourites but in reality, a scrappy encounter that falls in their favour would be just as sweet.
 “They have some talented players, some very talented young players, and have won their last couple against Cardiff and Derby, so they’ll come to Ewood in confident mood," Mowbray said ahead of the fixture.
 “They have some talented individuals at the top end of the pitch and at the back they have some tall, strong, powerful defenders. It’s obviously going to be a tough game, but it’s one that we should look forward to and take some belief into.
 “We know that if we perform as we know we can then we can give any team in this league problems," he added.
 “If they get on top then we have a mentality to keep clean sheets, to fight for one another and look to win the game a different way."

After a month of daily use, I wouldn't want to go without a lightbox again, ESPECIALLY during the winter. After my healthcare professional suggested I give one a try to fight the winter blues, I started searching around and discovered how stupidly expensive they can get. So I'll be honest: I wanted to know if I would gain any benefit from using a therapy lamp before dropping a ton of money on a pricier one. And this was cheap. It had the suggested brightness to be effective. Thought it'd be a good trial lamp that might last just long enough to help me decide if I want to invest in a 'good' one.      Upon watching it tumble from my hands and down three flights of stairs to a tiled landing on its second day with me, I decided this was a good one. Still worked. Three Flights of Stairs. Tiled Landing. Tumble. Didn't even result in a chip of plastic getting knocked loose only to rattle forevermore on the inside (you know what I'm talking about).      So, on top of being durable, it's lightweight and small build makes it easy to pack and take along on a trip without getting in the way. And best of all, it has helped my mood immensely. As I sit here writing this in Wisconsin in December, where the sun sets a bit after 4pm and rises after I'm already at work, I feel energized and... well, not horribly depressed.      So buy it. Go on. Your cart looks far too lonely up there. It'll feel better if you give it a lightbox. Just like you will.

En lo que va del año 120 empresas constructoras ya han cerrado y se han perdido por lo menos 500 empleos; el líder de la cámara de la construcción previó que al cierre del año puedan cerrar otras 80 constructoras Ante la falta de obras privadas frenadas por la pandemia, el presidente de la Cámara Mexicana de la Industria de la Construcción (CMIC) Puebla, Héctor Alberto Sánchez Morales, estimó que podrían cerrar de manera definitiva más de 200 empresas de su sector, además de que se registraron ocho mil empleos perdidos que no se han podido recuperar. El presidente de CMIC delegación Puebla lamentó que alrededor de 120 empresas de este gremio en todo el estado se vieron obligadas a cerrar de manera definitiva, provocando la pérdida de 500 empleos. En entrevista previa al evento Puebla Agradece, en donde se reconocieron a 67 policías y médicos por parte de la Iniciativa Privada, Sánchez Morales comentó que una de las causas que ha truncado la recuperación económica para su sector es la falta de licitación de obras privadas que tuvieron que ser frenadas por la pandemia. Ante ello, el líder de la CMIC mencionó que con la apertura de licitaciones de obras públicas en cuanto a mantenimiento de hospitales, escuelas y bacheo, entre otros, podrán recuperar de alguna forma su economía. “Ha ido sucediendo la apertura y liberación de diferentes licitaciones públicas en cuanto a tema de infraestructura, el mismo gobernador Miguel Barbosa ha ido anunciando hacia el cierre de año que seguirán dándose más licitaciones de este tipo”, comentó el empresario. Y es que el panorama que le pintó a su sector ha sido complicado, pues Héctor Alberto Sánchez Morales reveló que todavía podrían sumarse otras 100 empresas que cierren de manera definitiva al final de este año por la lenta recuperación que han registrado. Por último, el presidente de la CMIC informó que de los ocho mil empleos perdidos apenas se han podido recuperar dos mil de ellos, por lo que consideró que el sector constructor podrá tener una estabilización hasta el año 2021 ante la falta de proyectos particulares, por lo que le apostaran a la obra pública.

 FREETOWN -- Sawmill operator Paul Darling of East Freetown has been named the Massachusetts Wood Producer of the Year by the Massachusetts Forest Alliance.
 Darling, 68, and his family operate Gurney's Saw Mill in East Freetown, a 150-year-old family business now in its 6th generation. The Gurney Saw Mill produces lumber used for local construction, as well as for wholesale markets. The business has 8 full time employees, including Paul's son, Jon, and daughter, Jennifer Durant.
 Paul Darling began working at the mill in 1969 for his uncle, Merton Gurney, and he and his wife, Sharlene, purchased the business in 1993. The mill buys logs from local loggers and land clearers, and saws them into lumber and beams. The principal species sawed is white pine, with some red and white oak, hemlock and cedar also sawed when available. The mill includes both planing and dry kiln operations.
 Over the time the Darlings have operated the mill, they have increased production considerably and upgraded most of the operations to be more efficient. Wood produced at the mill is bought by local homeowners for projects, by shed and barn companies and contractors, by boat builders, and by wholesale dealers for pallet and crating parts. Demand for the mill's lumber has been high since the coronavirus hit due to homeowners doing more projects and seeking locally produced materials.
 The Douglas B. Cook Wood Producer of the Year Award is presented annually to a timber harvester, sawmill operator, or forest products professional who exemplifies the late Doug Cook's spirit of innovation and leadership in the industry. The award was presented on Saturday at MFA's virtual annual meeting.
 The Massachusetts Forest Alliance represents woodland owners, foresters, timber harvesters and forest products businesses and advocates for a strong, sustainable local forest economy. For more information about MFA, see www.massforestalliance.org

In the 2020 general election, Texans voted to stay the course. The returns are still unofficial, but the overall effect is clear: The state’s congressional delegation will have the same mix of Republicans and Democrats next year as it has today. The Texas Senate will have one more Democrat than it has now, but Republicans still have the majority. The Texas House, if the numbers hold, will still have 83 Republicans and 67 Democrats, along with a new Republican speaker. All of the statewide executive and judicial branch offices remain in Republican hands, as they have for more than 20 years.

We took up a new hobby this week. Woodworking. Partly because the end to the election-related folderol had left us bored out of our minds. But mostly because of…..The Table. A big six-footer with sharp, jagged edges. No big deal as long as it stayed put. But somebody was always moving it directly into our path---leaving our knees, shins, and egos bruised and battered following the inevitable collisions. So we bought a router, a jigsaw, and plenty of sandpaper and embarked on our first project as we waited for the votes to trickle in.
   
 Making sleepwalking safe again.
   
 Colossal mistake. Those power tools had minds of their own. Before you could say rabbet and dado, they'd jump-gouged the stretchers, beveled the biscuit joints, and destroyed all the intricate fretwork---leaving a pile of sawdust in their wake. Despite those setbacks, we still got the last laugh. For bright and early Wednesday morning, we not only had a much safer table but COVID-19 had also disappeared like magic. Just like they said it would.
   
 And all because we'd been rounding the corners.
   
 Alas, the reports of its demise---much like that of Mark Twain's---proved greatly exaggerated. Especially in virus-ravaged western Europe where empty pews lined St. Andrew's in Castle Combe, no pints were hoisted at The Angel on the Bridge, and The Ledbury's famous aged pigeon and cured mackerel sat untouched. The shades had been drawn and the doors were barred.
   
 For like Casey of old, the mighty UK had just shut down.
   
 Compared to Merrie Olde England, Michigan had been doing a rip-roaring trade. Until a new health order came along requiring diners at local restaurants to provide their names and phone numbers for contact tracing purposes. And judging by their reaction, you'd think they'd just been ordered to hand over their car title, deed to their ranch, and every dime in their bank accounts.
   
 Along with their first-born.
   
 Tyranny, they thundered. Invasion of privacy, they huffed. Nobody's business who I am, whether I give someone COVID, or if they give it to me. All while lamenting the demise of the restaurant industry they vowed to never again patronize. And leaving us to ponder a host of imponderables. Like why they have no problem using credit cards that permanently link their name, address, and purchase history. And include a health-related footnote that the two-pound Mega King-Size Gigantisorous Burgermeister Meisterburger they ordered came medium-rare.
   
 Instead of well-done.
   
 Usually we're pretty big on anonymity. It's why we shun rewards cards that tell the world we bought the stuff Mr. Whipple insists we never squeeze. Why we never pay with anything but cash. And why we always have paper bags over our heads whenever we're out in public. After all, we're the only kids to ever go through school without officially being there. For whenever the teacher took morning attendance, our response was always the same.
   
 Crickets.
   
 So it may surprise you to know we're fully on board with this directive. Maybe it's because we're a bit weird---OK, really, really weird---but restaurants' adoption of the same enter-and-sign-in-please protocol that's been standard operating procedure at many area churches since early summer gives us a warm, fuzzy feeling. And if that ruffles your feathers, we have the perfect tool to take the edge off your concerns and leave you with beautifully rounded corners.
   
 A coping saw.
   
 As for us, we're now all the more likely to be stopping by for a sit-down meal. Because sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name. And they're always glad you came.
   
 Cheers!

And then someone used it along with Faceapp to age themselves in a video. That was a lightbulb moment for us. Of course, you can use EbSynth for doing VFX retouches! Instead of painting over the video frame, you make a photorealistic edit. EbSynth doesn't care, it propagates anything from the keyframe to the inbetweens.

We have been blessed with bright planets to easily see in the evening sky (Mars, Saturn and Jupiter) and early morning sky (Venus). Let's try for another you can easily see with a pair of binoculars!      The planet Uranus, one of the gas giants, is seventh in line from the sun. British astronomer Sir William Herschel made history after spotting it in his 6.2-inch, 7-foot-long reflecting telescope, on March 3, 1781. This was the first planet ever discovered since mankind first looked up at the heavens enough times to see that some of the bright points of light were slowly moving, unlike the stars.      He made repeated observations over several weeks and consulted with other astronomers before confirmation was made.      The planet has been detected many times before, but astronomers mistook it for a star.      Uranus is well placed in the evening sky this fall. It is actually bright enough to find with eyes alone, as long as you have a dark, clear sky and dark-adapted eyes. It is shining at magnitude +5.7 and appears like one of many very dim stars.      You need a detailed star chart showing where to find Uranus. Once you think you have it, you can confirm it is Uranus by checking back over the next few nights to see if it has moved.      With binoculars, it is easy as pie. 10x35 binoculars will do fine; 10x50 makes the planet even brighter. If you have a telescope with a mirror or lens at least 3 inches wide, use an eyepiece giving you around 100x and you will share what Sir Herschel must have felt, when you see it as a small disc, unlike any star in the night sky.      It appears to have a somewhat greenish tint in a telescope. Some say bluish. I see it as pea green. Anyway, the color is from the perpetually clouded shroud enveloping Uranus, made up of methane gas. What color do you see?      In the early evening, face east to see the constellation Aries the Ram, and Cetus the Whale. Uranus is right between the "tail" stars of the Whale, which is an easily recognized star pattern on the east side of the constellation. (That's the left side as seen from those of us what I like to say are "Up Over" \- opposite of Down Under - and living in the Northern Hemisphere.)      There are four principal stars of Aries. They make a line that bends down on the west (right) side.      To help you find this region in the sky, Aries is a little over to the right from the glittering, compact Pleiades star cluster, a sight you can't miss. This year, over to the right of Aries, is the bright red planet Mars.      Uranus is very unusual among the planets as it is literally tipped on its side. The axis of rotation, through the planet's north and south poles, is tilted 98 degrees with respect to the planet's orbit. The Earth's axis is tilted 23.5 degrees. It is thought that a major collision knocked the planet over, long, long ago.      At 31,518 miles across, four Earths could fit inside. There are at least 27 moons circling, and 13 extremely faint rings.      Uranus takes 84 Earth years to go around the Sun, which is 1.83 billion miles away, on average.      NASA's intrepid Voyager 2 spacecraft flew by Uranus in 1986.      It may be some time before another space vehicle ventures to Uranus, but with a simple pair of binoculars, you can have a look for yourself the next clear night and let your imagination whirl.      It can make a memory. Like others, I have kept a journal of my astronomical observations. I first located Uranus over 50 years ago, on March 6, 1970, with 7x35 binoculars. I showed the planet to my mother. Uranus was in the constellation Virgo at the time, and has completed more than half of its orbit since then.      The moon is at last quarter on Nov. 8, and new moon is Nov. 15.      Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania.

TOWANDA BOROUGH – Ten-and-a-half year old K9 Edo was laid to rest next to K9 Moro in the Faithful Companion Cemetery in Smithfield Township on Wednesday. The Belgian Malinois was beloved in Bradford County for his nutty personality and spent most of his life as a nearly 24-hour partner to Officer John Hennessy.
 Edo was bounced around different police departments in his puppyhood, arriving in Pennsylvania from North Carolina at the age of four. Edo ultimately arrived in Bradford County after working for the Williamsport Police Department for one year.
 The department was in search of a new home for Edo as his Williamsport Handler was leaving in 2015. Hennessy spotted their posting for a five-year-old trained police dog and the rest is history; Edo came home to live with the Hennessy family to one day take the place of K9 Moro.

Rising for the fifth straight session, equity benchmark Sensex rallied 553 points and closed at a nearly 10-month high on Friday, tracking gains in index-heavyweights Reliance Industries and HDFC twins amid largely positive global market sentiment. The 30-share BSE index ended 552.90 points or 1.34 per cent higher at 41,893.06, while the broader NSE Nifty surged 143.25 points or 1.18 per cent to 12,263.55. On January 14, Sensex had closed at a record peak of 41,952.63. Reliance Industries was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, surging 3.78 per cent, followed by Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, HDFC twins and Kotak Bank. On the other hand, Maruti, Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints, UltraTech Cement and Nestle India were among the laggards. According to Hemant Kanawala, Head Equity, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance, Indian markets rallied in sync with its global peers, putting to the backburner the uncertainties in the US Presidential election. They delivered a broad-based performance, with both Nifty and Nifty midcap indices returning 1.5 per cent over the last week. Sectorally, BSE energy, bankex, finance, realty and consumer durables indices rallied up to 3.16 per cent, while telecom, healthcare and FMCG fell up to 0.92 per cent. Broader midcap and smallcap indices rose up to 0.54 per cent. During the week, Sensex soared 2,278.99 points or 5.75 per cent, while Nifty advanced 621.15 points or 5.33 per cent. Positive global sentiment from the US election, expectation of Fed open market operation and improving economic activities have added optimism in the market, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. Markets have surged consistently over the week, and Indian benchmark indices have continued their strong momentum supported by a good set of quarterly numbers and strong foreign fund inflow, he noted. Democratic leader Joe Biden appeared to be a step away from winning the US presidential election as the latest count of votes from a handful of battleground states indicated that the re-election chances of incumbent Republican President Donald Trump are getting slim by the hour. By late Thursday night, Biden -- who bagged 253 seats as against Trumps 213 -- appeared to be nearing the magical figure of 270 out of the 538 electoral college votes. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai ended in the red, while Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo closed with gains. Stock exchanges in Europe were trading on a negative note in early deals. Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 1.93 per cent lower at USD 40.14 per barrel. Foreign institutional investors remained net buyers in the capital market as they purchased shares worth Rs 5,368.31 crore on Thursday, according to provisional exchange data. In the forex market, the rupee settled 28 paise higher at 74.08 against the US dollar.

SC in a closed hearing on January 16 dismissed Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices' plea that they had filed back in November asking the court for a review of its October AGR ruling. Airtel and VIL have said they are likely to file curative petitions with January 23 due date impending in sight. The rejection to extend any help to carriers could potentially lead to a two player industry, analysts believe. VIL being left in the lurch could be seeing exiting the industry as KM Birla has previously said.
 Tariff revisions are believed to take the sector towards recovery, however, more clarity on where exactly the industry will be headed to will come post January 23 deadline of paying AGR compensation.
 Additionally, ahead of the Union budget coming on February 1, the industry which is being weighed down by multiple taxes and levies has reportedly asked the government for aid in the form of reduction of regulatory levies, taxes and license fees with lower interest rates to access credit. Demands for removal of GST from license fee and spectrum usage charges have also been made.

The Puerto Rico Retailers Association (ACDET, in Spanish) and the Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs (DACO, in Spanish) signed a memorandum of understanding to run “effective, coordinated and safe” Early Bird and holiday sales, paying special attention to the new reality of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “The reality on the island has dramatically changed due to the pandemic. Retailers have been seriously affected. However, we have relaxed and adjusted the dynamics of traditional Early Bird sales to add more options for special sales over the internet, as well as extended hours and days during the month of November to avoid crowding in stores in a single day,” said ACDET President Iván Báez.
 “We’re pleased that we have once again signed the collaboration agreement with DACO, with the health and safety of consumers and employees as a priority,” Báez said.
 “The agreement that we started six years ago has been very successful and this time we extended it to provide a safer shopping experience, with more contactless options, so that each customer is satisfied with their shopping experience during the holiday season,” he said.
 This month, many retailers offer special sales events in stores and online, in addition to the traditional Black Friday, and post-Thanksgiving sales. Each business will announce its special events and must guide customers on precautionary measures in compliance with the Executive Order to minimize the risks of COVID-19 contagion, he added.
 DACO Secretary Carmen Salgado and her team, has met with the main retailers to ensure consumer rights, guarantee consumer safety and support businesses, so service expectations and availability of merchandise are met, according to current regulations, she said.
 “We encourage consumers to stay informed of the alternatives that stores will make available, so they can take advantage of the long-awaited special sales of the Christmas season,” she said.
 “DACO has been working closely with businesses, guiding them to ensure they provide key information to customers, as well as their obligation to abide by all preventive measures the government and authorized agencies have provided,” Salgado said.
 "The main objective is to ensure that citizens enjoy the festive season and the expected sales, while avoiding contagion and stimulating compliance by merchants with our regulations,” added the Secretary.
 Puerto Rico’s retail sales registered a drop of more than 14%, compared to 2019, as a result of the pandemic and restrictions that began in mid-March. Retailers are hoping to gain ground on lost business activity during the holiday sales, ACDET said.

Restrictions on movement during lockdown also impact on commodities like seeds, fertilizers and farming implements which has, in turn, led to decreased food production. Many crops were not readily accessible and farmers struggled to get their produce to markets. And then, adding to the crisis, the continent’s poor storage facilities were not up to scratch.

Given that the star has to be in the best of health for their upcoming mandatory military service, the statement read that Suga decided to treat his condition once and for all and has decided to slow down and heal. "Suga also felt that it was important for him to restore himself to good health to prepare for his mandatory military service as well as his post-service musical career. After extensive discussion with the company, the decision was made to undergo the surgical procedure. Following the surgery, Suga will be unable to participate in most official activities so that he may fully focus on his recovery. Once doctors determine that the site of the operation has healed sufficiently, Suga will begin physical therapy so that he can ultimately return to the stage healthy and fully recovered. It may be difficult for Suga to meet his long-awaited fans for some time, including for the upcoming BTS “BE” album promotional activities," Big Hit's press release read.

Justin Bieber's one-time pastor Carl Lentz has come clean about his exit from the popular Hillsong Church East Coast, confessing he was fired for cheating on his wife.
 Church officials cut ties with the spiritual leader, who served as a mentor to Bieber in the mid-2010s, this week, announcing Lentz's position at the New York City branch had been terminated due to "moral failures".
 Now the 41 year old has opened up about his departure in a candid message to his Instagram followers.
 "I was unfaithful in my marriage, the most important relationship in my life and held accountable for that," he wrote. "This failure is on me, and me alone and I take full responsibility for my actions."
 "I now begin a journey of rebuilding trust with my wife, Laura and my children and taking real time to work on and heal my own life and seek out the help that I need (sic)," he continued.
 Lentz went on to add that he was "deeply sorry for breaking the trust" of his congregation.
 The pastor joined the New York church location in 2010, and in 2014, Bieber briefly lived with Lentz while he sought his spiritual guidance.
 He also helped the singer work through his break-up from Selena Gomez in 2017.
 Bieber, now a devoted Christian, wed model Hailey Baldwin in 2018.

"
 We took up a new hobby this week. Woodworking. Partly because the end to the election-related folderol had left us bored out of our minds. But mostly because of.....The Table. A big six-footer with sharp, jagged edges. No big deal as long as it stayed put. But somebody was always moving it directly into our path---leaving our knees, shins, and egos bruised and battered following the inevitable collisions. So we bought a router, a jigsaw, and plenty of sandpaper and embarked on our first project as we waited for the votes to trickle in.
 Making sleepwalking safe again.
 Colossal mistake. Those power tools had minds of their own. Before you could say rabbet and dado, they'd jump-gouged the stretchers, beveled the biscuit joints, and destroyed all the intricate fretwork---leaving a pile of sawdust in their wake. Despite those setbacks, we still got the last laugh. For bright and early Wednesday morning, we not only had a much safer table but COVID-19 had also disappeared like magic. Just like they said it would.
 And all because we'd been rounding the corners.
 Alas, the reports of its demise---much like that of Mark Twain's---proved greatly exaggerated. Especially in virus-ravaged western Europe where empty pews lined St. Andrew's in Castle Combe, no pints were hoisted at The Angel on the Bridge, and The Ledbury's famous aged pigeon and cured mackerel sat untouched. The shades had been drawn and the doors were barred.
 For like Casey of old, the mighty UK had just shut down.
 Compared to Merrie Olde England, Michigan had been doing a rip-roaring trade. Until a new health order came along requiring diners at local restaurants to provide their names and phone numbers for contact tracing purposes. And judging by their reaction, you'd think they'd just been ordered to hand over their car title, deed to their ranch, and every dime in their bank accounts.
 Along with their first-born.
 Tyranny, they thundered. Invasion of privacy, they huffed. Nobody's business who I am, whether I give someone COVID, or if they give it to me. All while lamenting the demise of the restaurant industry they vowed to never again patronize. And leaving us to ponder a host of imponderables. Like why they have no problem using credit cards that permanently link their name, address, and purchase history. And include a health-related footnote that the two-pound Mega King-Size Gigantisorous Burgermeister Meisterburger they ordered came medium-rare.
 Instead of well-done.
 Usually we're pretty big on anonymity. It's why we shun rewards cards that tell the world we bought the stuff Mr. Whipple insists we never squeeze. Why we never pay with anything but cash. And why we always have paper bags over our heads whenever we're out in public. After all, we're the only kids to ever go through school without officially being there. For whenever the teacher took morning attendance, our response was always the same.
 Crickets.
 So it may surprise you to know we're fully on board with this directive. Maybe it's because we're a bit weird---OK, really, really weird---but restaurants' adoption of the same enter-and-sign-in-please protocol that's been standard operating procedure at many area churches since early summer gives us a warm, fuzzy feeling. And if that ruffles your feathers, we have the perfect tool to take the edge off your concerns and leave you with beautifully rounded corners.
 A coping saw.
 As for us, we're now all the more likely to be stopping by for a sit-down meal. Because sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name. And they're always glad you came.
 Cheers!

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Hashim Thaci, who resigned as Kosovo's president to face charges including murder, torture and persecution, will make his first courtroom appearance before a judge at a special court in the Netherlands on Monday, the court announced Friday. Thaci, 52, served as a guerrilla leader during Kosovo’s war for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, before rising to political prominence in the aftermath of the conflict that killed more than 10,000 people. An international prosecutor has indicted Thaci on 10 charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes for his leadership of fighters with the Kosovo Liberation Army who are accused of illegally imprisoning, abusing and murdering captured opponents and perceived traitors during the war. Thaci insists he is innocent. At the court appearance Monday, a pre-trial judge will make sure Thaci's rights are respected and that he understands the charges, the Kosovo Specialist Chambers court said in a statement. Thaci stood down as Kosovo's president on Thursday before being flown to the court's detention unit. He said he wanted to protect against what he called attempts to rewrite history. \"Kosovo has been the victim. Serbia has been the aggressor,” he said. Most of the people who died in the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo were ethnic Albanians, and 1,641 people are still unaccounted for. A 78-day NATO air campaign against Serbian troops ended the fighting. The formation of the court and prosecutor’s office followed a 2011 report by the Council of Europe, a human rights body, that included allegations that KLA fighters trafficked human organs taken from prisoners and killed Serbs and fellow ethnic Albanians. The organ harvesting allegations are not included in the indictment against Thaci. In 2008,...
