With millions of votes already cast, Biden’s lead in the polls appears strong. The campaigns appear to be moving in opposite directions on paper, but it’s a very different feeling on the campaign trail. Trump is drawing huge crowds reminiscent of 2016′s final days. Biden is sticking to his cautious approach with tiny events focused more on social distancing than energizing supporters.

If you have never harvested your own Christmas tree, consider getting a permit this year, but act fast as there are a limited number of permits available.
 The Coconino National Forest began selling Christmas tree permits online on Thursday, Oct. 15.
 A total of 1,050 permits will be available for purchase on the Coconino NF Christmas Tree recreation.gov webpage, which also lists details about designated cutting areas, maps, dates, and types of trees that may be cut. Permit owners are allowed to cut between Nov. 16 through Dec. 24.
 Two hundred permits will be designated within the Flagstaff Ranger District, while 850 permits will be designated for the cutting areas within the Mogollon Rim Ranger District. A small amount of over-the-counter permits may be available in late November, but are not available currently since all permits are being sold online.
 When purchasing a permit online, read the overview and need-to-know information prior to purchasing. Visitors will also need to set up or login to a recreation.gov account to complete the transaction. Permits are issued one per household on a first-come, first-served basis until sold out.
 Many other national forests are also selling Christmas tree permits online for their forests. To find out if online Christmas tree permits are available in your neck of the woods, visit www.recreation.gov and search for "Christmas Tree Permits" to pull up a list of all the national forests that are taking part.

Tuttavia, il Difensore civico ha evidenziato che “le misure anti-assembramento adottate da Seta rispondono a un’esigenza del tutto nuova ed emergenziale che impone necessariamente un onere informativo adeguato all’eccezionalità dell’evento in corso: rispetto a tale esigenza, le diverse istanze pervenute dagli utenti del servizio di trasporto pubblico dimostrano che – nonostante le precisazioni fornite da Seta – è necessario incrementare e migliorare le procedure informative sulle nuove modalità di acquisto e obliterazione dei titoli di viaggio”. Per questo motivo, il Difensore civico ha invitato Seta ad adottare, nel più breve tempo possibile, ogni ulteriore provvedimento utile per incrementare e migliorare queste informazioni.

But that's not the only challenge Baron Cohen faces going in to the project: How do you dupe Americans when so many of them are already in on the joke? To the extent that the comedian's strategy depends on punking people while in character, will that still work now that Borat is a widely recognized comic star? Turns out, if you lose the character's trademark gray suit, one can still get away with an awful lot -- and more still if there are producers working behind the scenes to grease the wheels with donations (which is reportedly how they arranged for Baron Cohen, dressed in "Country Joe" disguise, to perform at a Three Percenters event protesting the government's pandemic response).

Unlike his Showtime series, "Who Is America?," Baron Cohen lets Democrats almost entirely off the hook, which is consistent with a larger strategy (whose consequences will surely be felt both in this election and in the years to come) to put aside any questioning of the left in order to defeat Trump -- with one major exception.

After 500 years of sorrow and strife, Arizona recently for the first time celebrated “Indigenous Peoples’ Day.”
 “This is an historic day,” said Supervisor Dawnafe Whitesinger, a member of the White Mountain Apache Tribe, “and provides an opportunity for our troubled communities to be empowered and not marginalized as they so often are.”
 Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey this year joined a dozen other states in declaring the one-time Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples’ Day, in a state with 21 federally recognized tribes.
 Some decried the national movement to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples’ Day.
 “I believe this is a dangerous trend,” said Rep. Paul Gosar in an email to constituents. His district includes all of Rim Country and a host of tribal lands.
 State Sen. Jamescita Peshlakai has been pushing for the declaration for years. The daughter of medicine man, silversmith and educator James Peshlakai, she assumed office in 2017 in state Senate District 7. She’s a Gulf War veteran who also served in the state House from 2013 to 2015.
 The one-year state proclamation does not necessarily replace Columbus Day, but Peshlakai has said she plans to continue to push for legislation to make the shift permanent.
 The slow shift from a holiday celebrating Columbus landing in the Americas in 1492 to a day recognizing the diverse cultures who have lived here for more than 10,000 years has spawned controversy — but also reconciliation.
 “I don’t think that it takes away from the history of our nation,” said Whitesinger. “One of the things that is important is to be reminded of why we have such a great love of our country — to be able to tell the truer story of that history is important and not to take away from those efforts that have come before. We want to recognize the efforts of everyone who has made the country what it is and everyone who has been a part of that great history.”
 Supervisor Jesse Thompson, a member of the Navajo Nation, said, “We need to remind each other every so often that we’re here together to do things to respect one another. I’m reminded of what our veterans have done for the land, the people, the government and the Constitution of the United States. I appreciate all the efforts to work together and to understand where we’re coming from and how we think.”
 Native Americans serve in the U.S. armed forces at five times the rate of the overall population, especially women. The Navajo codetalkers are among the most famed veterans. During World War II, the death rate among American Indians in combat was five times the rate of other groups, partly because they sought front-line combat positions.
 Supervisor Lee Jack, also a member of the Navajo Nation, said, “I appreciate this proclamation. It has been a long time coming. Right now, with the situation we’re in — we’re all coming together, helping each other. That’s what this great nation is all about and we’re all part of it and with prayers that we will live happily together.”
 Gov. Ducey this year added Arizona to the growing list of states celebrating Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota, and Vermont have officially designated the day as a holiday. Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin recognize the day through a proclamation.
 Scientists and archaeologists have increasingly revised the traditional historical view that Columbus “discovered” an almost uninhabited, wilderness continent. The seminal book 1491 by science writer Charles Mann summarizes the growing evidence that before 1492 the Americas were populated by thriving, cultures with roots dating back to before the last Ice Age.
 These cultures had perfected crops and agricultural techniques and contributed to globally vital crops including maize, corn, potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, the rubber tree, vanilla and others.
 However, research now suggests the viruses brought ashore by the first European settlers quickly killed perhaps 90% of the estimated 90 million to 112 million people living in the Americas. The immune systems of Europeans were shaped by the viruses that passed back and forth among humans and livestock like sheep, pigs and cattle. By contrast, Native Americans had few domesticated animals and proved tragically vulnerable to European diseases, according to a growing body of research.
 By the time European settlers arrived, those cultures were already shattered by one of the most catastrophic chain of pandemics in human history, according to the research summarized in the book 1491. The pandemics that swept the Americas may have killed 20% of the global population.
 Ironically, the devastating impact of COVID-19 — a bat virus that jumped to humans — has ripped through the Navajo and Apache reservations — with rates of death and infection three to five times as great as the rest of the state’s population. Doctors still aren’t sure why COVID-19 has hit Mative American populations so much harder, but a web of poverty and pre-existing health problems has played a role.
 Rep. Gosar said the attempt to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples’ Day represents an effort to “redact human history in the interest of political correctness. I believe this to be a dangerous trend. American history has become a battleground and the enemy is gaining ground.”
 Gosar’s congressional district covers northern Gila County and much of western Arizona, which includes the Tonto Apache, Cocopah, Yuma, Maricopa, Mohave, Halchidhoma, Yavapai, Hualapai, Havasupai and Piaute tribal lands. Gosar wrote, the violence and brutality of the exploration “should NOT be glossed over. However, it need not be amplified, highlighted and underscored.”
 He continued, “The history of the world is complex. Every time civilizations clash, there are winners and losers, the victors and the vanquished. That’s not to say we can’t also honor others who contributed to the fabric of our country — but in doing so, we shouldn’t disown other parts of our history. Those who lead the charge to rename Columbus Day are the same flag burners who tore down our statues this summer. They seek to rewrite history because the history offends them. Yet, no amount of selective editing can ever alter history. What we can change is our future and in order to do that, we must know our past. Happy Columbus Day!”
