Akron Mayor Dan Horrigan came within six feet of his digital media coordinator during this week's virtual town hall on Monday.
   
 Broadcast to the public via Facebook, the two wore masks. Horrigan intentionally kept his on as he began to speak.
   
 "I wanted to show that we still wear masks," Horrigan said.
   
 As businesses slowly reopen and city workers not on furlough return to City Hall Tuesday, Horrigan urged mask wearing -- not just in the close quarters of offices but everywhere possible outside the home.
   
 As he rides around Akron or pedals his bicycle in 30-mile circuits, he said he's been "absolutely amazed at the level of compliance" with the state's recommendation that people cover their faces when out and about. More than slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus, he said the mask-wearing is a "better way to say thank you" to health care and all essential workers who've put themselves in harm's way these past two months.
   
 "There is not a mandate for a mask, but I am imploring businesses and other places that are going to open up that workers and customers have masks on for the time being," he said in the opening minutes of his weekly address and public Q&A.;
      
 In the next 30 minutes, Horrigan again urged residents to fill out a U.S. Census survey and seek mental help if struggling with the stresses of hunkered-down life. "If you're feeling like you need to talk to somebody and say, 'how do I deal with this or how do I deal with that,'' he said, "then call" the Summit County Public Health hot line at 330-434-9144.
   
 Responding to a question, Horrigan said he couldn't say when bulk trash pickup would resume. Nothing outside of a cart is to be left at the curb.
   
 He encouraged people to get out and enjoy city and metro parks but maintain distance and stay away from basketball and other organized sports, for now. Summer camp programs, he said, are on hold pending guidance from Gov. Mike DeWine's office.
   
 City-owned playground equipment will remain off limits as other amenities return.
   
 Horrigan went golfing Sunday as Akron courses reopened this weekend. "It was fun. It was fun to get out and be able to golf again," he said. "But we have to do this slowly and we have to do this safely."
   
 Horrigan said the city will not be stricter than guidelines coming from the Ohio Department of Health.
   
 Asked about recent protests demanding the economy fully reopen, including an armed crowd outside the Ohio health director's home, the former history teacher diplomatically balanced the First Amendment, public health and suffering personal pocketbooks.
   
 "Yes," he said, "I agree with your right to protest, but safety is the overriding factor. And yes, we want to get the economy going again."
   
 On his 11:30 a.m. daily mayors' call with the governor, Horrigan said DeWine's task force dealing with child care was pressed for a solution as parents head back to work while some day care centers remain closed or curtailed. And he was told the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services "added literally hundreds of people and ... a significant amount of money to ramp up their physical infrastructure and information technology and computer systems," he said. "So, hopefully, you'll see those [unemployment] checks coming out quickly."
   
 Questioned about a shooting during a large gathering of motorcycles and cars in an East Akron parking lot Sunday evening, the mayor said police "did a phenomenal job" of breaking that up.
   
 He said testing for COVID-19 remains "a daily conversation." Coordination with county and state health officials began six weeks ago with the identification of possible sites for drive-up testing, which has not materialized due to a lack of supplies. Pharmacies and hospitals are performing limited testing.
   
 When capacity arrives, Horrigan wants minority communities at the front of the testing line.
   
 "I've been a strong advocate to test in the African-American community first and right away, whether it be in senior housing or somewhere else," he said. Blacks in Ohio are overrepresented in confirmed coronavirus cases and hospitalizations.
   
 Horrigan also said he's hearing that local businesses are finding better success in applying for relief through a second round of grants in the federal government's Payroll Protection Program.
   
 And, as seasonal road resurfacing kicked off with the top layer of asphalt stripped from Waterloo Road, Horrigan said the 54 miles of residential street paving in the 2020 budget may have to be scaled back as income tax and other revenue are forecast to fall with business closings.

LOUISIANA: Gov. John Bel Edwards has allowed non-emergency medical procedures to resume, and he's allowed restaurants to open outside seating. Mall stores also have been given the green light to restart business, but with curbside service only. Other nonessential retailers that have never been forced to close -- such as jewelry stores and boutiques -- cannot have more than 10 people in the store at a time. Businesses that remain closed include casinos, salons, tattoo parlors, movie theaters, gyms and entertainment venues, and the overall stay-at-home order remains in place through May 15.

Members of the public who want to address the Akron Board of Education now have far fewer hoops to jump through to do so.
   
 The board on Monday voted unanimously to loosen its public comment policy to allow for same-day sign-ups following a public outcry about the process to speak during board meetings, which was one of the most restrictive in Ohio.
   
 People will now be able to sign up to speak at the meeting -- that is, when meetings are held in-person again -- as long as they do so before it begins, or email their request to addresstheboard@apslearns.org ahead of time. They must share their full name and home address, along with any relevant group affiliation.
   
 Speaking time will be limited to three minutes per person and 20 minutes overall, with flexibility to lengthen the amount of overall time if the board votes to do so.
   
 The previous policy outlined a multi-step process that included two business days of advanced notification by mail or by dropping off a letter at the district's headquarters, although district officials have said they also accepted emailed requests to speak.
   
 "We've always welcomed and encouraged public comment and participation," Board President Patrick Bravo said. "This policy goes a long way toward improving that process."
   
 The treasurer's office has also vetted requests to speak for possible legal issues, and the possibility that a staff member could answer a speaker's question ahead of the meeting.
   
 That will still happen if people submit their request in advance, Bravo said.
   
 The previous policy was more restrictive than any other school board in Summit County, and was one of the most restrictive in the state. Most boards, along with city councils, allow for same-day sign-ups to speak.
   
 Members of the community expressed concern about the policy following an Akron Beacon Journal story last year that highlighted the limited number of people who had spoken to the board in the months prior and the restrictiveness of the process to speak.
   
 The four new members to the school board, elected in November, noted they heard about the issue on the campaign trail as a significant concern for voters, particularly as the board contemplates whether to seek a levy this year.
   
 Public boards in Ohio are not required to offer time for the public to speak, but if they do so, must make the process reasonable. The public comment sessions are designed for the board to listen with the ability to follow up, not to engage in a back-and-forth conversation.
   
 Akron's board will still place limitations on what can be discussed during public comment.
   
 "Participants will not be permitted to speak on matters related to vendors/business matters, formal complaints, grievances, specific students or student records, personnel matters, and potential or pending legal matters," the new policy states.
   
 Board Vice President N.J. Akbar said he hopes the change in policy will bring the public closer to the board, so members of the community feel they can approach the board without constraints.
   
 "We really want to hear from you, and we want to do what we can to make sure that's possible," Akbar said.

HAWAII: Gov. David Ige has extended a statewide stay-at-home order through May 31, though the state took some small initial steps to relax restrictions on May 1, including allowing people to golf provided each golf cart carries only one person unless this individual is accompanied by someone from the same household. Elective medical procedures and auto dealer visits by appointment have also been given the green light. Lt. Gov. Josh Green said over the next three weeks authorities will consider authorizing what he called medium-risk activities like going to the gym and patronizing restaurants, provided social distancing guidelines are followed.

The operator of an outlawed homeless camp has lost one case challenging a governmental action in Akron. His attorneys -- and the city -- now are turning their attention to a second case.
   
 For nearly two years, businessman Sage Lewis allowed a homeless tent community to grow on his commercial property in Akron's Middlebury neighborhood. Acting on nuisance complaints from neighbors, including a senior living facility near the camp, Mayor Dan Horrigan's planning staff pushed Lewis to seek conditional zoning because the city does not allow campgrounds.
   
 Lewis applied for the unique campground permit in April 2018. City Council denied the application and Horrigan's neighborhood assistance staff posted a sign that December ordering Lewis to disband the camp.
   
 Lewis did so and his attorneys with the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit firm of libertarian-minded lawyers, promptly filed two lawsuits: one challenging City Council's denial of the permit and another that came about when Lewis asked the Akron Board of Zoning Appeals to reverse the city's order to take down the tents.
   
 The first suit, which garnered no wins for Lewis in lower courts, died last week when the Ohio Supreme Court rejected a final appeal. But the second cases continues in Summit County Common Pleas Court.
   
 After being asked to remove the tents, Lewis presented the Board of Zoning Appeals a proposal for "a pared down version [of a homeless community operation] where he would use tents only in emergency situations," explained Diana Simpson, a lead attorney on his case. Lewis continues to advocate for homeless camps in Akron while placing homeless people in rehabilitated housing, including a group home his nonprofit Homeless Charity operates with the approval of city inspectors.
   
 Simpson filed a brief in March in the open lawsuit challenging the decision of the Akron zoning appeals board. The city is scheduled to respond by the end of May. "In normal circumstances, we would have oral arguments," Simpson said of the next step.
   
 But these are not normal times with the novel coronavirus disrupting court systems. Still, Simpson expects a county judge to rule later this year on the second case. That ruling, regardless of who wins, would likely trigger an appeal that could also head toward the Ohio Supreme Court.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenyan authorities are looking into the deadly crash of a plane carrying medical supplies in Somalia, while one Somali official asserts that the aircraft was shot down. Six people on board were killed. The Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority on Tuesday said the Kenyan- registered twin-engine plane with African Express crashed Monday afternoon on approach to Bardale “under circumstances we are yet to confirm.” A projectile fired from the ground hit the plane as it approached the airstrip in Bay region, Ahmed isaq, a local official with the Southwestern State regional administration, told The Associated Press. The airstrip is a base for the Ethiopian military under the multinational African Union mission, which is combating the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group. The group controls parts of rural southern and central Somalia. There was no immediate comment from Ethiopian authorities Tuesday. The plane had left Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, and stopped in Baidoa before going on toward Bardale, the Kenyan statement said. Kenyan authorities said they were in contact with the Somali Civil Aviation Authority. Somalia’s transport ministry called the crash “a terrible accident” and said the government was investigating.

An Akron man, who raped and killed a woman and left her body in a storage facility in 2019, was living in one of the units.
   
 Michael Olson even had mail delivered to him at the storage unit business.
   
 Now, the family of Mary Kay "Katie" Wohlfarth, the Akron woman whom Olson was sentenced to life in prison for raping and killing, is suing the company that owns the facility.
   
 "I think the biggest thing is they want some answers," said R. Craig McLaughlin, the Mayfield Heights attorney for Wohlfarth's family. "Why did this happen? How did it happen? They want to make sure storage [businesses] like this take steps to protect customers."
   
 Wohlfarth's family recently filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Leslie Floor Sanding Inc. in Summit County Common Pleas Court. The flooring company, which has operated since 1956, has a storage-unit facility at 573 E. Tallmadge Ave. in Akron.
   
 Wohlfarth's body was found June 19 in a unit that James Olson, Michael Olson's father, rented.
   
 Wohlfarth, 68, a well-known antiques dealer, also rented a storage unit at the facility. Her family had reported her missing hours before police found her body.
   
 A surveillance video showed Olson driving Wohlfarth's 2012 Kia Sedona minivan from the storage facility. The minivan was found June 20 in West Akron.
   
 The Summit County Medical Examiner's Office determined that Wohlfarth died of "blunt force trauma to the head and neck."
   
 In an agreement with prosecutors, Olson, 36, pleaded guilty Aug. 27 to several charges, including aggravated murder, rape, gross abuse of a corpse and grand theft of a motor vehicle. He was spared from facing the death penalty.
   
 Judge Amy Corrigall Jones immediately sentenced Olson to life in prison without the possibility of parole, the agreed-upon penalty.
   
 Several of Wohlfarth's family members and friends spoke at the sentencing, sharing details of her life while expressing disdain for Olson. A few said they think Olson deserved to be put to death.
   
 Maria Boscia, Wohlfarth's niece, said she hadn't cried about her aunt's death because she was left with so many questions.
   
 "Was she afraid?" Boscia asked, looking at Olson.
   
 Michael Olson blamed drugs, though he said he chose to take them. Police found methamphetamines when they arrested him.
   
 "I hope that -- one day -- you will see that I'm not the devil," he said.
   
 In the five years before Wohlfarth was killed, police were called to the Leslie Floor storage facility at least 10 times for complaints that included breaking and entering, theft and vandalism, according to the lawsuit.
   
 Prior to Wohlfarth's death, Michael Olson was living in the storage unit rented by his father and received at least two pieces of mail there -- one from the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles and another from Huntington Bank, according to the lawsuit.
   
 Under Leslie Floor's polices and industry standards, the units were not permitted for use as a habitat.
   
 Wohlfarth's storage unit was across from Olson's. She offered Olson a fan because the air was hot inside the unit he was living in, McLaughlin said.
   
 Wohlfarth, prosecutors say, helped Olson clean and vacuum his space. While she emptied the vacuum into a trash receptacle, Olson waited for her, then assaulted and killed her inside her storage unit.
   
 Olson later moved Wohlfarth's body to his storage unit and left her body in a trash can in the unit, according to the lawsuit.
   
 Olson's actions were captured on the facility's surveillance video.
   
 The lawsuit claims Leslie Floor breached its duties of care for Wohlfarth by allowing Olson to live in his father's storage unit and failing to provide adequate safety measures to protect her.
   
 Wohlfarth's family incurred funeral and burial expenses, a loss of companionship, mental anguish and other losses. The lawsuit seeks damages of more than $25,000, plus attorney fees.
   
 McLaughlin said the family didn't sue Olson because he will be incarcerated for the rest of his life.
   
 Officials from Leslie Floor didn't return messages seeking comment.
   
 The case is assigned to Judge Kelly McLaughlin.
