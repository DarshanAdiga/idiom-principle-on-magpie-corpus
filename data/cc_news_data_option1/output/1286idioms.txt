Roma, 1 apr. (Adnkronos) - "Dieci giorni fa avevamo denunciato l'inadeguatezza del presidente Inps Tridico dopo aver preso atto che l'Istituto non aveva predisposto per tempo regole e procedure necessarie all'accesso al congedo parentale previsto nell'emergenza Coronavirus. Questo nonostante la misura fosse stata piu volte anticipata dal governo ancor prima della sua effettiva approvazione. Quell'incidente non ha consentito a tanti genitori di poter fruire di tale agevolazione in quanto le procedure sono state rese operative solo in prossimita della scadenza del periodo di congedo da richiedere. Oggi, con il blocco della piattaforma Inps per le richieste dei sussidi stanziati per i lavoratori autonomi e, addirittura, con la pubblicazione dei dati personali di molti richiedenti, si e toccato il fondo".

Explaining what happened, he recalled: “I had a phone call to tell me the alarm was going off and there was a break in. When I got there the glass was smashed, bikes were knocked over and they had taken one of the electric bikes.


  “The bike was in between some other bikes and there was another electric bike which is a mountain bike next to it. They took the hybrid bike which is more of a road and a bit of off roading rather than the pure mountain bike.


  “I don’t tend to keep the pedals on the bikes especially the electric ones. I keep them locked away and the key and the charger so they don’t have any of them. A neighbour said he saw them come back in so they must have realised there was no pedals as they went to ride away, run back in the shop, got a set off another bike, attached by hand and cycled off. Paper work was chucked in the road.


  “I haven’t seen many, if any, of those bikes out on the streets so it would be quite an easy one to spot. It is black and blue. It is going to be pretty useless after a bit of time because he is going to struggle getting a charger for it.”

BEIRUT (AP) — I’ve seen the streets of Beirut empty before, during wars when the shells were falling and under curfews after various bouts of fighting. But it is the silence that is getting to me.
 On the streets, at the supermarket, and even as people stand in line (one meter apart) outside banks and grocery stores, no one speaks. It seems like every single person is wearing a mask and gloves, even those inside their cars, driving alone.
 Exactly how did we get here, and how will we get out? It’s the same question everyone is asking, bewildered at the sea change that has come over our lives.
 It was only weeks earlier that my colleagues and I were covering massive anti- government protests in a square just down the road from our office. As protest movements tend to go, they began with euphoric demonstrators thronging the streets and ended with tear gas and batons snuffing out the calls for change.
 Then came more uncertainty. The financial crisis. The mass layoffs and the realization that people’s savings will probably evaporate.
 Then, the coronavirus. First schools closed, then restaurants and cafes. Then — overnight, it seemed — we were locked in our homes. Police now hand out tickets to offenders for simply walking on the sidewalk by the sea. The other day a military helicopter flew low over the city, booming orders for residents to stay indoors.

Dear Dave,   My husband and I just completed Baby Step 3, and we have six months of expenses saved for an emergency fund. How should we determine when something is actually an emergency?   Riley


  Dear Riley,   Congratulations on doing the work, being disciplined and saving like crazy! Now you've got peace of mind, and a pile of cash, that will help turn an emergency into nothing more than an inconvenience.


  There's no shame in using your emergency fund if you really need to. That's what it's there for. Just remember to ask yourself a few questions anytime something pops up to make sure you've got a real reason to use it.


  Is the expense really unexpected? Christmas happens on Dec. 25 every single year. You know your semiannual car insurance payment is coming, too. Make sure things like this are part of your regular, monthly budgets. Some examples of unexpected expenses might be a job loss or pay cut. Emergency medical expenses and car accident repairs might fall into this category, as well.


  Is it absolutely necessary? Most people say they know the difference between a want and a need, but that's not always the case. Replacing your only mode of transportation would be a need. Upgrading to a newer, fancier car is not. If your car goes down for the count, you need transportation. Use your emergency fund to buy something affordable and reliable you can pay cash for. But don't dip into it just to upgrade your decent car for one with a million bells and whistles.


  Is it urgent? Practice the art of patience whenever possible. If your home's air conditioning unit goes out in the middle of summer, that's probably an urgent fix. But hearing about the "sale of the century" at your favorite retail store? Grabbing the newest, hottest cell phone when yours works just fine? Nope!


  Your emergency fund is all about long-term security, not instant gratification. Don't blow it impulsively, but don't be afraid to use it when it's really needed. Be wise, and ask those three questions. Check yourself so you don't wreck yourself - or your budget!   Dave

  ## Client Background


  First of all, I want to emphasize that this is an actual portfolio with actual shares being traded. This article focuses on John, who is a recent retiree (retired on January 1, 2018) who has requested my help in managing his own portfolio instead of paying a financial advisor. It is important to understand that I am not a financial advisor and merely provide guidance for his account based on a friendship that goes back several years. In this article, I will refer to John as "my client," and I do this for simplicity's sake, but I do not charge him for what I do. The only thing John offers in return is allowing me to write anonymously about his financial journey with the hope that I can potentially help others who are wanting to achieve the same thing but do not have the direct resources to make it happen!


  John was able to set himself up for a comfortable retirement by eliminating all of his debt so that the only bills are the absolute basics like property tax, water, etc. John has sources of income that have provided him with a comfortable retirement outside of the investments discussed in this article, and (up to this point) he has not needed to draw funds from his retirement accounts.


  John is only a few years away from needing to satisfy his required minimum distributions (RMDs) from his Traditional IRA. It is important to remember that the Roth IRA does not have this requirement, which means John can withdraw funds at will from his Roth. On his Traditional IRA, it is important to be more strategic because we want to make sure that the cash being generated by his investments outpaces his minimum distribution for as long as we possibly can.

So, now we know moo goo gai pan is essentially chicken with mushrooms, along with some other veggies that seem to vary depending on who is preparing it. When I order a chicken based dish at a Chinese restaurant, the meat is always very thinly sliced and super tender, but I could never figure out how to replicate that at home. Luckily, after a little research, I realized that it’s actually quite easy to get thin and tender chicken pieces in your own kitchen. The first step to getting restaurant-style chicken is to cut your chicken into very thin slices. The easiest way to do this is to freeze the chicken breasts for about 20 minutes, or just until they firm up – you don’t want them frozen solid, but you do want them hard enough to easily slice. Cut your chicken against the grain (width wise) into strips. The next step in the process is a technique known as velveting – the chicken takes a quick dip in a cornstarch and egg white mixture which makes it extra tender. This extra little step is well worth it for a restaurant style end result.

Ferrocenyl dimethyl carbinol is a crystal powder with melting temperature of 70°Ð¡. Organometallic agents create sedimentation of metals on the walls of combustion chamber. Therefore, organometallic anti-knock additives are typically used in combination with materials which convert churly metal oxides into volatile compounds. Due to high toxicity of lead type anti-knock agents, significant disadvantages and high cost associated with it, the research for a special material, which does not comprise any toxic substance, is in the pipeline. Such anti-knock agents are organic amines containing, xylidine methylaniline and extralyne.

Having said that, given the COVID-19-induced sell-off, there’s a risk that demand for luxury experiences will drop. However, Jonas argues, “All that being said, the company's estimates conservatively assume an under penetrated high net worth (HNW) market (<0.1% of those with $10 million-plus net worth) and the space tourism capacity it expects to deliver has been expected to fall short of demand.

What Young did against Wisconsin was both impressive and unfair.


  Any team desires to have an elite pass rusher in order to wreck a game, but Young was able to completely dominate on a historic level from start to finish against Wisconsin. Earning a sack in each quarter of the game, Young's four sacks would tie four other Buckeyes for the school record for sacks in a game.


  Adding to his dominance, the third and fourth quarter would feature sack fumbles from Young that would completely break the back of a Wisconsin offense that was trying to fight its way back into the football game. Unfortunately for Wisconsin, Young chose the big stage to show the nation that he should be considered the best player in the country.

Naturally, I was intrigued by "How to Read Like Mark Twain," a Smithsonian.com article by Terena Bell, that quotes one of Twain's more abject lies: "I have no liking for novels or stories." He was, in fact, "a voracious reader," and Bell's story cites some of Twain's favorites, including "Robin Hood and His Merry Foresters" by Joseph Cundall (that strongly influenced "Tom Sawyer"), Milton's "Paradise Lost" (Twain owned multiple copies and rewrote versions of it), and "most of Charles Dickens" ("young Twain knew some Dickens novels by heart"). The "Twain family owned more than 3,000 books, and the humorist is known to have read nearly 5,000 literary works," according to Auburn University professor Alan Gribben who in May will publish a three- volume work of literary criticism outlining "the reading that influenced Twain, from Shakespeare to Poe." It's fascinating how Twain drew upon Shakespeare who drew upon Montaigne who drew upon the Greeks and Romans, each spinning off disparate literary classics.


  In 1887 Twain sent a list of reading recommendations in response to a request from a Maine minister. For boys and girls he suggested “Macaulay, Plutarch, Grant’s Memoirs, Crusoe (for boys), Arabian Nights, Gulliver and Tennyson (for girls).” For grownups it was “Shakspeare (sic), Browning and Carlyle (French Revolution only), Malory’s King Arthur, Parkman’s histories (a hundred of them if there were so many), Arabian Nights, Johnson (Boswell’s, because I like to see that old gasometer listen to himself talk).” Reading tastes have changed, but my pantry’s well-stocked with Nilgiri tea from India’s Blue Mountains, and my bookshelves are burgeoning, so I echo Dostoevsky, who said “let the world go to hell, but I should always have my tea.”

Procure to pay (purchase to pay or P2P) is the process of obtaining and managing the raw materials needed for manufacturing a product or providing a service. It involves the transactional flow of data that is sent to a supplier as well as the data that surrounds the fulfillment of the actual order and payment for the product or service, the transfer of specified key procurement activities relating to sourcing and supplier management to a third party — perhaps to reduce overall costs or maybe to tighten the company’s focus on its core competencies. Procurement categorisation and vendor management of indirect materials and services (commonly referred to as Indirect procurement) are typically the most popular outsourced activity.

Penn State crushed the over on its projected win total for the 2019 season, stringing together eight straight wins to start the season to climb into the fourth spot of the first College Football Playoff rankings.


  In light of Penn State’s massive offseason personnel overhaul, sending five early departures to the NFL while experiencing a mass exodus through the transfer portal, plus the normal graduation of its senior class, the success proved to be a surprise to many. Riding confident performances from quarterback Sean Clifford and an outstanding collective effort on the defensive side of the ball, in conjunction with a schedule that allowed for gradual development, Penn State couldn’t have asked for much more.


  And yet, a 31-26 loss at unbeaten Minnesota on Nov. 9, coming out of a bye week, created an undeniable sense of anticlimax.


  Unexpected as Penn State’s success might have been up until that point, with only the Gophers, Indiana, at Ohio State and Rutgers left on the schedule, even a probable loss to the unbeaten Buckeyes would have kept the Nittany Lions in the CFP conversation. Instead, the loss sent Penn State into the postseason with a 2-2 mark in its last four, leaving the Nittany Lions to settle for a Cotton Bowl date with Memphis, a 53-39 win that served as a national appetizer for the day’s CFP semifinal games later that evening.


  With more critical departures to the NFL this offseason, where does that leave Penn State heading into 2020?

It remains possible that the demand curve will be sharply V-shaped, with the historic decrease in demand followed by a substantial return to previous levels (there is little hope that the demand curve will return to 2019 demand levels quickly, but 80-90% is well within possibility, with capacity reductions largely offsetting the difference between demand and available seat miles). In other words, if things go well in the fight with COVID-19, airline shareholders could be in for significant appreciation.


  In either case, the Airlines should outperform the broad market during the recovery. Cyclical stocks, of course, have a history of doing just that. The sharp downturn in the industry creates increased concern of bankruptcy-and this concern is not without merit: the risks of illiquidity obviously increase as cash evaporates. Still, investment in an ETF such as JETS largely reduces the consequence of this (if an airline goes out of business, its routes and aircraft will almost certainly be absorbed by another airline, meaning that future gains in profitability will still be retained by the overall investment package).


  For those looking to directly own airline stock, Southwest (LUV) and Delta (DAL) were the best positioned big players going into the current environment, with Southwest having slightly better position due to less exposure to international flying. With the funds made available to airlines via the financial stimulus package however, United (UAL), American (AAL), JetBlue (JBLU), and Spirit (SAVE) should all be relatively safe (for the time being). During periods of uncertainty, there is something to be said for buying quality-particularly when considering such a volatile industry. Still, depending on threshold for risk, there is the potential for greater gains with less financially solid acquisitions.

Heavy-duty machineries perform under severe environmental conditions, wherein conditions oscillate from cold to hot operating temperatures. Moreover, agricultural, mining, construction equipment are continuously subject to heavy operations during the project phase, which demands high-performance lubricants to keep the engine healthy and simultaneously aid in achieving maximum performance outputs. This keeps product demand at a high.

Malört, or Jeppson’s Malört, is a digestif liqueur flavored entirely with the herb wormwood (the same herb said to give Absinthe its hallucinogenic kick). Malört is produced — and primarily consumed — in Chicago, where the residents are as proud of the bitter liquor as they are of their biting winters. According to its own website, Jeppson’s Malört was first produced by a Swedish immigrant named Carl Jeppson during Prohibition and sold as “medicinal alcohol,” its acrid taste supposedly making the case that a person would drink it only if he had to. Local legend says that Jeppson himself actually enjoyed its unique flavor because years of smoking meant it was one of the only things he could taste.
 Harrison suggests that if you must mix it with something, mix it with grapefruit juice or club soda, though most drink it as a shot — possibly to get it over with.
 The word “malört” is Swedish for “wormwood,” a frizzy herb that looks like spiky parsley, and the drink is what is referred to as a _besk brännvin_ (Swedish for “burnt wine, or less literally but more accurately, “bitter distilled spirit”). First brewed as a digestif during the Middle Ages, the wormwood in Malört supposedly will kill stomach parasites, which, if you’ve tasted Malört, should not surprise you. I think it tastes like water that’s had old tires soaking in it, with a hint of nuclear grapefruit on the back of your palate and strong notes of nail polish remover in the nose.
 For people from Chicago, Malört is a rite of passage, a test of drinking prowess and/or a dare. I first had Malört at a party, when a friend from Chicago brought a bottle of it to the cocktail table as a prank. And the folks at Jeppson’s Malört are unapologetically proud of this reputation: The label claims, "Its bitter taste is savored by two-fisted drinkers.”
 Up until recently, you could get the stuff only in the Chicago area, where it was produced by a single family-owned company, but the brand sold in 2018 to the CH Distillery (still located in Chicago), and it’s slightly more available now. In Seattle, you can find it at the Black Cat Bar downtown (2132 First Ave.). Before the sale, according to Harrison, bars in Seattle that wanted to carry it had to buy it in Chicago and ship it here, or physically carry it into the state. Now, Black Cat has it on tap for $7/shot.
 And people are drinking it.
 “I sell at least one every shift,” says Harrison. If you get a group of people from Chicago, it sells itself.”

Premier League clubs have been accused of living in a "moral vacuum", with players urged to take their share of the financial hit from the coronavirus pandemic as non-playing staff begin to feel the pinch.


  Last year's Champions League finalists Tottenham as well as Newcastle and Norwich have faced a backlash for using the British government's furlough scheme, which will guarantee 80 percent of employees' income up to a maximum of £2,500 ($3,000) a month.


  "It sticks in the throat," said lawmaker Julian Knight, who chairs the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, referring to the use of public funds to prop up wage bills.


  "This exposes the crazy economics in English football and the moral vacuum at its centre."


  The Times said the elite should not be a "drain on the exchequer".


  "(The) furlough scheme.is for clubs lower down the pyramid enduring the cash- flow crisis without gate receipts, not by the likes of Spurs and Newcastle United," the paper said in a comment piece.


  That £2,500 sum would be a drop in the ocean for many Premier League stars, yet there has so far been no agreement on wage cuts or deferrals for players, unlike the situation at other top European clubs such as Juventus and Barcelona.


  Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said he hoped discussions between the Premier League and players' and managers' representatives would "result in players and coaches doing their bit for the football eco-system".


  Levy is in the firing line despite taking a 20 percent cut in salary for the next two months.


  On Tuesday he announced a 20 percent cut for 550 non-playing staff on the same day it was revealed he was paid £7 million last season, including a £3 million bonus for the completion of the club's new stadium, which ran well over time and budget.


  Players at Barcelona have taken a 70 percent pay cut during Spain's state of emergency and will make additional contributions to ensure other employees receive full wages.


  The squad of Italian champions Juventus, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have agreed to have their wages stopped for four months while players at German giants Bayern Munich accepted a 20 percent pay cut.


  "Clearly, when players at Barcelona, or Juventus voluntarily, or some German clubs voluntarily enter into these agreements with their clubs, then good on them," said FIFPro general secretary Jonas Baer-Hoffmann.


  "Where the players have the means and they step forward I think that shows very much that they understand what is happening right now and frankly we will be seeing more of that."


  The chasm in player earnings between the top end of the game and the lower leagues, and even within the same clubs, complicates the role of players' unions in finding common ground.


  London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC that top-flight players should take the hit.


  He said: "Highly paid football players are people who can carry the greatest burden and they should be the first one to, with respect, sacrifice their salary, rather than the person selling the programme or the person who does catering."


  Players do not want to be the fall guys in a crisis only for clubs to behave irresponsibly when their income returns.


  "If a club is doing deferrals then the regulations state that they would be embargoed from signing any players," said PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor.


  "It's ridiculous to have clubs deferring their obligations to players and then making big-money transfer signings."


  Transfer talk tends to fill the void during the summer football break, but that is far from the minds of most executives just trying to ensure their clubs are still standing in a few months' time.


  "When I read or hear stories about player transfers this summer like nothing has happened, people need to wake up to the enormity of what is happening around us," said Levy.
