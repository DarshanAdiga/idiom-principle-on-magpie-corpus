It's hard to imagine what we talked about before coronavirus introduced an entirely new lexicon. In the past few weeks, terms like social distancing, shelter in place, and flattening the curve have become trending hashtags and coronavirus headlines have dominated our news feeds. But with so much corona virus-related content out there and so many people looking for answers in an uncertain time, it can also be hard to decipher what's scientific fact, and what's simply a misguided tweet gone viral.
 For starters, here’s a recap of what we do know right now: There are currently more than 15,000 coronavirus (aka COVID-19) deaths globally. In the United States, both mandated and self-quarantining is in full effect. Northern California has placed nearly 7 million residents in the San Francisco Bay area under a shelter-in-place order, with exemptions for essential activities. New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order that required people to stay home, excluding those who offer essential services, such as pharmacies and grocery stores. Other states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, have enacted similarly strict measures, while other states are continuing to follow suit.

The staff moved from its old office location just down the road into the new one in late November 2019.
 “That building has served us well for the last 49 years, but it was time to update our building as well as some technologies and the work environment,” Bailey said. “Here it’s a bright, pleasant environment for the employees to work in. All the responses I’ve got from them have been positive.”
 Due to inclement weather and other delays, the finishing touches on the building’s exterior, such as landscaping, wasn’t completed until recently, Bailey said.
 “It’s a building that we’re pleased with and we hope that the community is too,” he said. “There’s been a great partnership between the Town of Geraldine and this bank for half a century, and we hope to keep it that way for many years to come.”
 Originally from Susan Moore, Bailey has been with Liberty bank for nearly eight years, after serving as the regional president for BBVA Compass for six years.

Despite feeling like we'll be holed up in our homes indefinitely, quarantine won't last forever. At some point in the (hopefully near) future, things will begin returning to normal, full of actual work days, brunches, and in-person happy hours. Until then? We'll have had plenty of time to plan out our warm weather outfits — including which bags we'll wear with our sundresses and carrot-leg jeans.   For 2020, the best spring bag trends include a little something for everyone. Are you into prints? You might want to try a statement-making graphic or stick with classic snakeskin. Hoping to take your look to the next level? Go with a whimsical shape, such as an animal or a star, and embrace texture with a fuzzy or feathered purse. Plus, if teeny tiny micro bags aren't your thing, a variety of supersized options were also spotted on the runway.
