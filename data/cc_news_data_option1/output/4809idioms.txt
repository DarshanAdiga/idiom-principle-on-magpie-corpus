Great teeth require a disciplined approach to buccal hygiene. Your dentist should be your chief guide, as he/she can recommend techniques and products that suit your gum and teeth. What you can do at home is engage in daily, proper cleanings executed with effective tools to create a healthy environment in which gums are strong and support teeth. Remember that teeth that resemble white marble are not necessarily suited to your skin tone because enamel shades vary between people and even within the mouth. Consequently, it is productive and realistic to focus on minimizing stains and keeping gums in the pink of health. Once you have mastered how to take care of your teeth and gums, the healthy, shiny smile is the next step.

The reason behind this is that the mega prize is their main allure. To win it, you’ll likely have to wager the max amount. You must check if you are betting enough to be eligible for the jackpot. If you are not, you’re wasting your time. However, do not go overboard and set a loss limit. Casino-poker variants may also feature jackpots, so if you’re not doing good at slots, perhaps a game where you can utilize a little skill may be a better choice.

A court in Berlin heard Tuesday how witnesses alerted police after seeing a man dump a wig, clothes and a bicycle in a river last year, allowing officers to swiftly arrest the suspect in an alleged Russia-ordered political assassination.
 Testimony by the two men is central to the trial of the man German authorities have identified as Vadim Krasikov, a 55-year-old Russian citizen whose alleged killing of a Georgian man in broad daylight in downtown Berlin has fueled frictions between Germany and Russia.
 German prosecutors allege there is ample evidence indicating Russian officials ordered the killing of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, who had fled to Germany with his family. Russia has accused Khangoshvili of killing scores of people during fighting in the Caucasus, but denied being behind his slaying.
 German news agency dpa reported that the two witnesses told the Berlin regional court they became suspicious when they saw the suspect disappear into bushes by the banks of the Spree River on Aug. 23, 2019. They moved to a bridge to get a better view and called police.

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) — A white Iowa police officer who shot and paralyzed a Black man during a 2016 traffic stop will not get his job back, a panel has determined. The Cedar Rapids Gazette reported that the city's Civil Service Commission on Monday voted unanimously not to reinstate Officer Lucas Jones. His attorney, Skylar Limkemann, said an appeal is planned. Jones was fired in June, but not for the 2016 incident in which critics say he unfairly pulled over and needlessly shot a fleeing Jerime Mitchell. The city continues to defend the shooting in a lawsuit filed by Mitchell. A grand jury declined to charge Jones, who said he fired in self-defense after Mitchell resisted and began driving away as they struggled. Instead, Jones was fired over his handling of a traffic stop two days before he shot Mitchell in which he gave a young Black mother a major break. According to a termination letter, Jones should have arrested the woman — the daughter of a tow truck driver who was a professional acquaintance of Jones — for driving with a suspended license and had her car impounded under department policy. But he let her go, had her father come pick up the vehicle, turned off his body microphone to conceal his actions and later gave untruthful statements about doing that during a 2017 internal investigation, the city alleged. Jones testified in September during a termination hearing that the woman had no outstanding arrest warrants or significant criminal history and he didn’t see her as a threat to the community.

BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has pardoned 24 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, in the second wave under a new policy that gives former pot offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred and records are shielded from public view. Burgum pardoned 16 people earlier this year. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota’s workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.

BrahMos Aerospace, an India-Russian joint venture, produces the lethal weapon that can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or from land platforms.
 India has already deployed a sizeable number of the original BrahMos missiles and other key assets in several strategic locations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.
 In the last two-and-half months, India has test fired a number of missiles including an anti-radiation missile named Rudram-1 which is planned to be inducted into service by 2022.
 On October 18, a naval version of the BrahMos missile was successfully test fired from an indigenously-built stealth destroyer of the Indian Navy in the Arabian sea.
 The Indian Air Force on October 30 test-fired the air launched version of the weapon from a Sukhoi fighter aircraft in the Bay of Bengal.
 The BrahMos missile provides the IAF a much-desired capability to strike from large stand-off ranges on any target at sea or on land with pinpoint accuracy by day or night and in all weather conditions.
 The IAF is also integrating the Brahmos supersonic cruise missile on over 40 Sukhoi fighter jets which is aimed at bolstering overall combat capability of the force.

The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) has moved about 50,000 electric poles to strategic locations, mainly along coastal areas in Tiruchi Circle encompassing delta districts, to meet any eventualities arising out of Nivar cyclone, which is expected to make landfall between Karaikal and Mamallapuram on the east coast.
 Though the exact tract and location of the landfall is yet to be clearly determined, it is said that the impact of the cyclone would be felt in coastal districts including Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur and Pudukottai. In addition, Ariyalur district is also expected to bear the brunt of the impact. Power poles are likely to be damaged or uprooted due to the fury of the cyclone, officials said.
 “We have sounded a high alert along coastal areas. Men and machinery have been put on standby to carry out measures in the pre and post cyclone period,” M. Valarmathy, Chief Engineer, Tangedco, Tiruchi circle, told _The Hindu_.
 She said about 50,000 electricity poles in different sizes had already been kept at strategic locations including Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Mayiladuthurai, Ariyalur and Thanjavur. Further, nearly 200 transformers and line materials, including high tension and low tension power cables, had also been moved to different places of the circle. The Tiruchi Circle had been divided into 40 divisions to launch power restore operations in their areas. Superintending Engineers of each district would oversee the operations.
 Ms. Valarmathy said control rooms had been set up in all eight districts in the circle. They would function round the clock up to November 27.
 She said that the situation was under control at the moment. “I have received field inputs of rain in Ariyalur and Sirkazhi, and have asked the Superintending Engineers to send hourly reports. Instructions hved been given to field officials to switch off power supply from the afternoon of Tuesday. However, it will depend upon the rain and windy conditions. It is aimed at preventing loss of human lives if the cyclone brings destruction to the power infrastructure.”
 She said the experience of Gaja cyclone would be of help in post-cyclone reconstruction works. More than three lakh power poles were replaced in Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur and Pudukottai districts. The services of workers involved in the reconstruction works would be utilised if needed.

More than two dozen census takers and supervisors have contacted the AP since the beginning of the month, telling similar stories about corners cut in the rush to close cases as the Trump administration sought to end the census before the Oct. 31 deadline set in response to the pandemic.
 The most recent cases also include a census supervisor in Baltimore who said that thousands of addresses were manually marked completed without evidence that residents had been interviewed.
 The Alabama supervisor in her text included a photo of her hand-written instructions listing the 15 steps she said would allow the census takers to mark in their bureau-issued iPhones that only one person lived in a home without interviewing anyone about the household's demographic makeup or the number of people living there.
 The supervisor also recommended performing the steps two to three hours after trying to interview members of a household to avoid arousing suspicions from higher-ups who could track where census takers had been through their IPhones.
 The instructions for the census takers in Alabama were sent a week before the Supreme Court made a ruling that allowed the Trump administration to end field operations for the 2020 census on Oct. 15 instead of Oct 31.
 The Census Bureau has said it compiled information for about 99.9% of U.S. households in the U.S. during field operations. At the height of the door- knocking phase of the census in mid-August, there were more than 285,000 temporary census takers on the bureau's payroll.
 In Baltimore, census supervisor Amanda Colianni said she believes 5,300 cases in neighborhoods she managed were closed prematurely and removed from the door-knocking effort after only one attempt by census takers to interview members of households in mid-to-late September. The Census Bureau was working toward what officials believed at the time would be an Oct. 5 early finish for the count.
 Colianni said she does not know why the cases were removed or how they were resolved, though she says it's possible that government administrative records were used to fill in the information gaps when detailed records from the IRS, the Social Security Administration or other agencies existed for the households.
 An outside census advisory group warned this month that filling in large numbers of households with administrative data late in the census process suggests no high quality data existed for the addresses. If that had been the case, the group said, it would have been used earlier to save census takers time.
 "I know the management level in Baltimore was trying to push, push, push to get everything done," Colianni said. "There was no possible way we could have any semblance of a reasonable completion rate by Oct. 5."
 Colianni filed statements with the Commerce Department's Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel and a coalition of local governments and advocacy groups that have sued the Trump administration over its attempts to shorten the 2020 census schedule. The coalition's case led to the Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to end the head count.
 The coalition's lawsuit in San Jose, California said the deadline for finishing the count was changed from the end of October to the end of September to ensure that number-crunching for the census would take place while President Donald Trump was still in office, no matter the outcome of the presidential race.
 That could guarantee the enforcement of an order Trump issued in July seeking to exclude people in the country illegally from numbers used to determine congressional seat distribution. Trump's order has been found unlawful by three courts -- in New York, California and Maryland. The Justice Department is appealing.
 Whether the Census Bureau can meet a Dec. 31 deadline for turning in the apportionment numbers to Trump is now in jeopardy after the agency said Thursday that it found anomalies in the data during the numbers-crunching phase.
 The coalition contesting the early end to the count is seeking to extend the numbers-crunching phase of the census from the end of December to the end of next April, especially since the Census Bureau is relying on large numbers of administrative records to fill in gaps from data collection.
 Lawyers for the coalition have said they have documented other cases of census takers being instructed to cut corners and fudge numbers in order to close cases.
 "Shortening data-processing operations will prevent the Bureau from finding and fixing these errors, as the Bureau itself has acknowledged," their lawsuit said.

First off, a slot’s RTP may vary from site to site. For newbies, the RTP, or return-to-player, signifies how much of the bet amount the game will pay back over time. Almost all developers publicly publish the RTPs of their games. That said, because a review site lists a return-to-player of 97%, that doesn’t mean that it will payout at that rate at the casino you’ve selected, as operators may be able to adjust this percentage. If you play at a reputable platform, one with a top regulatory body license, this percentage cannot fall below a specific number.

Instead, Jones was fired over his handling of a traffic stop two days before he shot Mitchell in which he gave a young Black mother a major break.
 According to a termination letter, Jones should have arrested the woman — the daughter of a tow truck driver who was a professional acquaintance of Jones — for driving with a suspended license and had her car impounded under department policy.
 But he let her go, had her father come pick up the vehicle, turned off his body microphone to conceal his actions and later gave untruthful statements about doing that during a 2017 internal investigation, the city alleged.
 Jones testified in September during a termination hearing that the woman had no outstanding arrest warrants or significant criminal history and he didn’t see her as a threat to the community.

Feinstein’s decision to give up such a highly coveted post is likely to renew speculation — which arose in 2018 when at age 85 she ran for a sixth term — that she will not serve the entirety of her Senate term.
 Her decision not to pursue any full committee posts — including the Senate Intelligence Committee, where she also has the seniority to lead — comes as her tenure on the Judiciary Committee has come under fire, particularly her handling as the ranking Democrat of the confirmation hearings of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominees Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
 Some rank-and-file Democrats had quietly discussed with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) whether seniority is still the best way for Democrats to determine chairmanships and whether Feinstein was the right person to lead Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. Schumer met with Feinstein in late October for what he described as a “very serious” conversation.
 Senior lawmakers rarely step down from powerful chairmanship or ranking-member positions, making Feinstein’s decision unusual. While Republicans have term limits for committee chairmanships, Democrats do not.
