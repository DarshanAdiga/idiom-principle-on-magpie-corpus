“While it is lovely to come and want to leave a card or a little cross or something that was meaningful, that really should be left with the understanding that it will go away,” she said.
 Her rule of thumb is: “If it would break your heart if it was lost, broken or stolen, don’t bring it to the cemetery.” Williams reviews this and other ground rules with families during burial preparations. Families do most of their visiting in the weeks and months following a death, she said.
 Cemeteries are natural spaces that need regular maintenance and that have visiting hours open to the public.
 And in recent years more homeless enter the cemetery grounds looking for a place to sleep.
 “One night it’ll be clean, the next night it’ll be dirty,” said Dan Tellez. Tellez owns DRT, the maintenance company that contracts with many Bay Area cemeteries, including Pilarcitos and Our Lady of the Pillar.
 Tellez has been in the business of groundskeeping for more than 30 years, longer if you count the years since age 5 spent raking leaves alongside his father. His father passed on the company to him before he died, and now Tellez has passed on day-to-day management to his son. But he remains involved, largely assisting the ground crews.
 His first burial was a Catholic burial, and Tellez has since become familiar with the Church’s final rites.

One of Hargis’ best moments came in a difficult time, the investigation of OSU’s football program after a series of Sports Illustrated stories published in 2013.
 From the beginning of a nearly two-year investigation, Hargis took the claims seriously, insisting on full cooperation with NCAA investigators and a thorough internal probe.
 Ultimately, the accusations were deemed “fundamentally unfounded.” By being transparent, forthright and principled, Hargis gave credibility to those findings.
 Before becoming the OSU president, Hargis had been a successful attorney and businessman, run for governor, made a name for himself as a political pundit and served in a variety of responsible posts, including the state election board, human service commission and the Constitutional Revision Commission.

Sure. Well, there's two different stories online, right? The bootbarn.com business, very strong top line, very strong bottom line performance. And that is a combination on the top line of healthy traffic and healthy improvement in conversion. On the Sheplers side, we are -- we've completely rebranded that site. We've taken away the sales and promotional aspects of it, and we're really pleased that traffic has continued to improve. But given the fact that the price points are a little higher and it's not nearly as promotional and is really trying to underscore the legacy of this Western -- 100-year-old Western brand called Sheplers, the conversion has come down. So -- and that's not entirely unexpected. But given that fact that we've changed the promotional posture and put all of that together, our e-commerce profitability is up over 100% versus last year. So we essentially view that as a comp growth of 100% in e-comm, despite the fact that it's a combination of sales and margin. In terms of your specific question of new customers versus existing customers, about -- if we just think about Boot Barn, about 1/3 of the increased traffic, maybe a little bit more than that, is new customers. And the others are either existing customers shopping more frequently or stores customers shifting over. You had one other question before you had your additional question that you were going to ask which was around how does the basket differ? There's not huge differences. I mean boots are penetrated a little bit higher on bootbarn.com. Denim has penetrated a little bit higher on sheplers.com. The average basket online is a little bit higher, about $30 higher than the basket in the stores. So roughly $130 or $135 versus $105 in the store, something like that. But other than that, the composition of the business, as you look at all of the different channels and the different brands, is sort of in line with each other. I mean there are some nuances that the merchants would see. But by and large, we're selling boots and denim and hats and work apparel.

Federal officials released documents that provide details about a June 21, 2019, skydiving plane crash that became one of the deadliest civil aviation accidents in the United States over the past decade. The public docket contains reports from a National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the crash. The plane crashed on Oahu’s north shore. There were no survivors. The reports included testimony from people who had varying accounts of the crash pilot’s flight habits.

Here again I feel money is badly needed, but I do wonder just how realistic it is to expect us to benefit much from it.


  As someone who has been cycling a lot more this year, I am starting to get a bit more confident on my bike – but I’ve also to see some obvious improvements that could be made to encourage more to follow suit.


  And my attitude is changing a bit – I’m starting to see the benefit of small changes rather than big, expensive, expansive projects.


  I live quite near the National Route 51 bike route in north west Ipswich. It’s the route from Oxford to Felixstowe but the bit that interests me is the stretch from the Old Norwich Road on the edge of Ipswich to the town centre.


  The cycle route is largely along secondary roads like Shakespeare Road, Highfield Road and Bramford Lane – but does cross some busier roads like Norwich Road and Bramford Road. There’s also a good stretch along the River Gipping.


  The issue is that on these roads there may be pedestrian crossings (some, but not all, have cycle symbols as well) that invite cyclists to use them and fading signs on wide pavements that say they should be shared by pedestrians and cyclists.


  What is needed here is clarity about where cyclists should travel and, especially on the busy roads with wide pavements, clear indications that they are entitled to stay off the main carriageway with traffic.


  There are also some quite convoluted, and confusing, manoeuvres that cyclists are expected to undertake to cross busy roads – like at the Highfield Approach junction on Norwich Road and the Riverside Road/Bramford Road traffic lights.


  What I’m talking about here is a cycle route that is supposed to have some importance. It’s National Route 51. It would be good to have some signs that road users – drivers as well as cyclists and pedestrians – could see so those in cars going along Bramford Lane or Highfield Road don’t regard the bike in front of them as an unnecessary irritant.


  The funding for that isn’t going to come from the Town Deal – but Suffolk County Council is supposed to be bidding for more from the government for active travel and it is the kind of project they should be looking at.


  My fear here again is that all the bright ambitions at the start of lockdown of transforming travel seem to have dissipated somewhat. The idea of getting out and making life easier for those who want to use cycles or walk has gone. Now the bean-counters are asking whether we really should spend money on schemes only of value to a minority of road users.


  That is a shame because I still think there’s an opportunity to get more people on their bikes again – and that would be good news on so many levels.

On Tuesday, Zeta raked across Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, toppling trees and briefly cutting power to more than 300,000 people but causing no deaths.


  It then regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico along a path slightly to the east of those of Hurricane Laura, which was blamed for at least 27 deaths in Louisiana in August, and Hurricane Delta, which exacerbated Laura’s damage in the same area weeks later.


  The deteriorating weather prompted early voting sites to close for hours in the western Florida Panhandle. One voter in Mississippi worried about how long felled trees and debris might block roads.


  “With the election I just kind of hope the city gets the roads clear by November 3rd so everybody can get out and vote,” said Mackenzie Umanzor, of D’Iberville, Mississippi.


  An average season sees six hurricanes and 12 named storms. This extraordinarily busy season has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.


  And the fact that so many of the storms have been concentrated in such a small piece of Gulf Coast real estate has meant repeated damage for some places. On Dauphin Island, Alabama, Mayor Jeff Collier said residents and workers had nearly finished cleaning up from Hurricane Sally when the wind started blowing and the water started rising yet again.


  “This is going to put his back to square one again,” Collier said.

The Red Sea is one of the most attractive places for diving. Its increasing popularity has been providing the closest access to clear tropical waters for many an tourists.   - Historically, a majority of the diving activity takes places in Egypt, which has a large portion of the coastline, including some of the finest dive spots, such as Ras Muhammed, the Straits of Tiran, and the famous Thistlegorm wreck, a British armed Merchant Navy ship initially discovered by French oceanographer Jacques Yves Cousteau.   - At the turn of the millennium, the Egyptian government became more focused on diving tourism. It then observed that the overall number of visitors was increasing and would reach nearly 15 million a year by 2010.   - The government realized that tourists were not just visiting historical sites, such as the pyramids of Giza and Luxor, but were also interested in the Red Sea. Also, many tourists were non-divers initially who then, learned to dive in Egypt.   - However, there was a massive inrush of dedicated and certified divers to Egypt due to its unique marine environment.   - The Egyptian government appointed a new group to oversee the diving standards in the country, called the Egyptian Chamber of Diving and Watersports (CDWS).   - The CDWS was instructed to use ISO 24803 as the benchmark for dive center operations. Every dive center in the country was to be inspected and compared to this standard, in order to be allowed to operate legally. This was a major undertaking, as there were only about 250 centers at that time.   Rebreathers Becoming Commonplace at Dive Resorts

  HANOI, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Vietnam deployed hundreds of soldiers and heavy machinery on Thursday to search for survivors after landslides triggered by torrential rains from Typhoon Molave, one of the strongest typhoons in the region in decades.


  The landslides, which hit remote areas in the central province of Quang Nam late on Wednesday, killed 13 with 40 missing as rescue efforts were hampered by bad weather at the tail end of the storm, the government said. State media said 12 fishermen died at sea.


  "We can forecast the storm path or the amount of rain, but can't predict when landslides happen," Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung said in a statement.


  "The road is covered under deep mud and heavy rains are still lashing the area, but rescue work has to be carried out quickly," Dung said.


  State television said the bodies 12 fishermen were found on Thursday after their boats sank when trying to return to shore two days earlier. Two navy vessels had been mobilised to find them and 14 were still missing.


  Since early October, Vietnam has been battered by storms, heavy rains and floods which have affected over a million people.


  The government said Typhoon Molave had left millions of people without electricity and damaged 56,000 houses. It weakened to a tropical depression after making landfall on Wednesday and is expected to reach Laos later on Thursday.


  Images on social media showed villages overwhelmed by flooding, and roads filled with debris, toppled trees or blocked by landslides.


  Before the storm, people in affected areas had shared photos of corrugated roof tiles bearing their names and addresses, to help facilitate rebuilding efforts.


  Heavy rain of up to 700 millimetres (27.5 inches) will continue in parts of central Vietnam until Saturday, the weather agency said.


  Before it hit Vietnam, Typhoon Molave passed through the Philippines, where it caused flooding and landslides that disaster authorities on Thursday said had killed at least 16 people.

So I mean, I think the thing that gives us a lot of confidence that the customers we're targeting is the size of our basket. So we're getting through this and the NPS scores. The people that we are targeting truly love Sprouts. And we just need to communicate to more of those type of people, what the opportunity is if they come into Sprouts and go forward on that. There's plenty of them. We know that. We know the size of the market. So the market opportunity out of that were at $200 and something billion as a market opportunity out of the $1.2 trillion, $1.3 trillion whatever the number is trillion dollar market. So that narrowness gives us confidence that there's enough people there and that we communicate with them effectively. With regard to cutting into the bone, I think -- I think I said at one of my very earliest calls was what we don't want is the promiscuity of shopping that we've had by having very aggressive grocery, produce and grocery price points that are loss leaders. Those customers are not the long-term customers that are going to make it work for us, and that's what we've been planning for well before COVID. The confusion, I suppose, for all of us as we try and win this for next year and the year after, has been how much of these dynamics have been affected by the COVID environment and how much of it is down to our very specific work that we're doing. There is no doubt that there's been a consolidation of trips, which has probably lost us some of those customers that we -- that you're identifying in the nontarget space. But we're feeling pretty confident that the people that we're targeting have got plenty of room with there's plenty of room for us to grow when we get past this COVID environment so that we can truly understand it better.

Former South Korean president Lee Myung-bak was ordered back to prison Thursday as the country's Supreme Court upheld a 17-year jail term for bribery and embezzlement offences.


  The conservative Lee, who served as president from 2008 to 2013, had been out on bail awaiting the ruling and was not in court for the decision, but police were seen at his Seoul home to take him away, according to reports.


  The ruling is not subject to further appeal and at age 78 means Lee is likely to die in prison unless he receives a presidential pardon.


  All four of South Korea's living former presidents are either behind bars or have served jail terms -- often as a result of investigations begun under successors who are political rivals.


  Lee was first convicted of embezzlement and accepting bribes in late 2018 and jailed. An appeals court later increased his sentence to 17 years but granted him bail pending a further appeal to the nation's highest court.


  The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld his conviction for embezzling 25.2 billion won ($22 million) and accepting bribes totalling 9.4 billion won, as well as the 17-year sentence.


  Lee is also subject to a 13-billion-won fine and must forfeit assets of 5.7 billion won.


  "There was no legal fallacy in the appellate court's ruling on bribery and embezzlement," the Supreme Court said in a statement.


  Lee's conservative successor Park Geun-hye is currently serving 20 years in jail for bribery and abuse of power after being ousted in 2017 over a corruption scandal that prompted massive street protests.


  Another former leader, the liberal Roh Moo-hyun, took his own life after being questioned in a corruption probe involving his family -- an inquiry that took place during Lee's presidency.


  Roh was the political mentor of incumbent President Moon Jae-in, who served in the Blue House throughout Roh's presidency, including a year as his chief of staff.

In the best of times, it’s a massive logistical challenge to get millions out to vote. In 2020, the difficulty has been dramatically compounded: by fear of the coronavirus, by complications and confusion over mail-in ballots, by palpable anxiety over the bitter divisions in the country. As early voting has surged dramatically, advocates behind the scenes have been mobilizing in myriad ways, from volunteer letter-writers to block associations to national movements, from college marching bands to lone violinists, from fleets of minivans to bicycle parades to horseback rides to the polls in Indian Country.

Josh Jacobs didn’t mince words when asked to evaluate his latest performance. The first-round running back who set the Raiders rookie rushing record in 2019 was held to 17 yards on 10 carries in a loss to Tampa Bay that has him searching for answers about how to get back on track this season. “I was embarrassed. It was very embarrassing for me,” Jacobs said Wednesday. “I went and looked at film. I went and watched practice. I watched previous games. I was trying to see where I could improve my game, what I could bring to this team to try to get the guys motivated to be where we want to be.” Jacobs and the Raiders running game haven’t been there so far this season. Jacobs is averaging just 3.4 yards per carry following the worst game of his young career, ranking 44th out of 46 qualified runners so far this season. The performance against a Buccaneers team that allows a league-low 3.0 yards per carry is explainable. The Raiders were without their entire starting offensive line all week after right tackle Trent Brown tested positive for the coronavirus and the other four starters were sent home because they had “high risk” contacts with Brown. They returned to the team just hours before the game but struggled to get into a rhythm after a lack of practice. “We had a lot of guys that didn’t practice the whole week. You could tell them like we weren’t all on the same page at the same time,” Jacobs said. “It was kind of slow getting to certain reads and certain things.” But the problems running the ball go deeper than just that one game. Jacobs has topped 4.0 yards per carry just once this season as the line has struggled to open up holes with Brown and left guard Richie Incognito missing most of the season, and Jacobs has been unable to break...

“With Catholic cemeteries, you’re always torn between ideology of the Church and what you have to do,” he said.
 Tellez has been around long enough to have seen the evolution of the cemetery grounds after local parishes and mortuaries turned over Pilarcitos and Our Lady of the Pillar to the archdiocese, with a larger budget and administrative staff to handle the upkeep.
 Tellez remembered how a Half Moon Bay local whom he came to know over the years and who has since died used to bring his goats to graze the weeds at Pilarcitos, long before a lawnmower ever arrived on the cemetery grounds.
 Now, the operation is modern and efficient. There are budgets, especially around how to keep the lawns green without running out of water. There are newer tools. There are schedules. And there are rules.
 “It’s hard to pull florals especially if someone just put it down because a policy said so. So we work hard to go around these things,” Tellez said.
 According to the San Francisco cemetery department’s rules, anything breakable needs to be removed, in part to avoid broken pieces getting stuck in the lawn mower and shattering. Flowers are usually OK.
 Despite Tellez’s and his crew’s careful treatment of flowers, Williams said she still gets angry calls from family members. They tell Williams, “Your men came through and threw the flowers all over the place.”

Greensea says its universal open software architecture OPENSEA was put to work as a development platform for Houston Mechatronics in the early development phases of its shape-shifting Aquanaut underwater vehicle.
 HMI's Aquanaut is a multipurpose subsea robot which employs a patented shape- shifting transformation from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to a tetherless remotely operated vehicle (ROV), removing the need for large vessels and umbilicals. The vehicle's two distinct operating modes enable both the efficient collection of data as well as the remote operation of maintenance and repair tasks at a significantly lower cost than today's technology.
 Aquanaut utilizes a similar software architecture that allows for collaboration with OPENSEA, and HMI was able to leverage Greensea's experience in subsea navigation and vehicle control early on while focusing their development efforts on their core competencies: robotics, manipulation and autonomy.
 "OPENSEA enabled us to quickly integrate an executive control and mission planning solution onto Aquanaut, our transforming AUV/ROV. The open and modular architecture of Greensea's software allowed us to pick and choose tools within the SDK that covered our own software gaps. This, in turn, allowed us to pull our testing schedules forward and achieve both our customer's and company's milestones during early phases of Aquanaut development and testing," Jide Akinyode, Aquanaut Program Manager.
 "HMI is the perfect example of how OPENSEA as a platform can be used to expand a company's technology footprint without adding the overhead of having foundation-level technologies such as navigation and vehicle control," said Ben Kinnaman, CEO of Greensea. "Greensea has spent more than a decade developing and testing systems needed for highly accurate subsea navigation and control in all kinds of hostile, demanding environments. Using the OPENSEA SDK, HMI is able to develop a revolutionary idea on a robust platform."

Albian Ajeti believes the upcoming cup double-header against Lille and Aberdeen offers Celtic the perfect way to get back on track.
 The Hoops go into their Europa League clash with the French club on Thursday night after losing to Rangers and AC Milan and drawing with Aberdeen at Pittodrie on Sunday, a rare poor run of form for the Scottish champions.
 After returning from France the Hoops will prepare for the William Hill Scottish Cup semi-final against Aberdeen at Hampden Park on Sunday, with the prospect of playing Hibernian or Hearts in the final and winning the trophy for a record-breaking fourth successive time.
 The Switzerland striker is adamant that spirits have remained high in the dressing room and is looking forward to two big fixtures.
 He said: "Sometimes you win and lose games, this part of football and we are professional enough to handle that.
 "We have a good atmosphere in the dressing room. I didn't feel any negative things or bad things but as a player and as a team, you obviously want to win every game.
 "So we know, we know that we need to get back to winning ways again.
 "I think these two games are really coming at the perfect time for us.
 "An important away game in Lille, where we can show our quality and play our football.
 "We came here and want to win. And the next game on Sunday is an important game against Aberdeen that we want to get through."

 Still anticipating a busy day at the polls, Goodnow said there will be about 25 more poll workers than in years past, bringing the total to 100 across Salem’s five polling places. The pandemic has led to some turnover since the primary election, meaning many of the workers are new.
 “Some just weren’t comfortable and we’ve replaced them,” Goodnow said. “Because of the anticipated turnout we are staffing extra. I made a call out to the community for people to step forward. We’ve been pleasantly encouraged by the response.”
 Everyone is encouraged to wear a mask while voting and maintain social distancing guidelines. Goodnow said masks cannot denote a candidate whose name appears on the ballot.
 Additionally, voters will be asked to refrain from using hand sanitizer before handling ballots; a lesson learned the hard way in February.
 Two machines in Salem needed to be swapped out during the primary election because of paper jams attributed to ballots wet with hand sanitizer.
 An extra machine will be available as backup, according to Goodnow.

The large shipment volumes that are going on in the supply chain reluctance to then customers kind of across the board to touch things when they're running full tilt and they don't want to break something.

A former official of the US homeland security department injected new drama into a tumultuous presidential race on Wednesday by revealing himself as the "Anonymous" author of a bombshell 2018 Op-Ed chronicling deep disaffection among senior members of the Trump administration.Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff to the secretary of homeland security, owned up to the controversial piece and a subsequent book -- A Warning -- that further chronicled the chaos in a blog on Medium. He left the administration last fall, joined Google and is now on leave.He has been a strident critic of the president as a TV commentator.Trump slammed him as a "sleaze bag" and a "low life" at a campaign rally in Arizona and said, "This guy, in my opinion, he should be prosecuted."More vitriol followed from the Trump campaign, which called the disclosure "the least impressive, lamest political 'reveal' of all time".White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany slammed Tyler as "this low-level, disgruntled former staffer … a liar and a coward".In an Op-Ed in the New York Times in 2018, the "Anonymous" author, who was described as a "senior administration official", had written of a widespread "resistance" by senior officials to frustrate parts of the president's agenda they found disagreeable and his "worst inclinations".In the blog post on Medium, Taylor conceded writing the Op-Ed anonymously may have been problematic for some, especially because of the seriousness of his assertions, but said by remaining anonymous he "forced the president to answer them (his assertions) directly on their merits … rather than creating distractions through petty insults and name-calling".Taylor's reveal added a new and dramatic element into the race that is now in the final stages in which more than a third of eligible voters -- 75 million -- have already cast their ballot through early in-person voting or by mail in an unprecedented turnout before Election Day on November 3.Trump held two rallies in Arizona in an effort to hold on to a traditionally Republican state that he had won in 2016, by a reduced margin than the Republican nominee before him, but where he has been trailing his Democrat challenger Joe Biden by a slim but steady margin.Biden, who cast his vote with his wife in Wilmington, Delaware on Wednesday will be campaigning in Florida Thursday, as will be Trump.Florida is a key battleground state that no successful presidential candidate has not won in recent memory. Trump squeaked through with 1.2% victory margin in 2016, but he now trails Biden by 2 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls and 1.5 point in the FiveThirtyEight average.The race itself may be slipping out of the president's grip as he trails his Democrat challenger by a margin that has held steadily over past months.He is behind Biden by 7.5 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls and 8.9 points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.

Ronald “Ron” E. Weiss


  Ronald “Ron” E. Weiss, 83, of Beatrice received his heavenly wings on October 27, 2020 at Beatrice Community Hospital. He was born on November 11, 1936 to Ed and Bernadine (Bitting) Weiss who were farmers near the community of Virginia. In his early years, he was a member of the First Christian Church of Virginia. He graduated from Virginia High School and attended Peru State College for two years where he obtained his degree in business. He entered the Army National Guard in September 1959 and was medically discharged in March 1960. He married LorAnna “Lori” Dorn on June 9, 1957 at Zion Lutheran Church by Pastor Richard Fruehling. They enjoyed their life together until Lori's passing in 2006. This marriage was blessed with four daughters: Deborah Ann, Peggy Lea, Pamela Ann and Sherry Lynn. During their marriage, Ron had many different occupations including being a partner in a plumbing company (M & L Plumbing), a banker (Citizens State Bank) and an insurance salesman (AFLAC). On July 13, 2008, he was married to Beverly “Bev” (Parde) Drummond at the Evangelical Free Church of Kearney, Nebraska. He was a member of the American Lutheran Church of Filley where he served on the council for numerous years. He was very active within his community by serving on the Village Board of Virginia, the American Legion and the Sertoma Club, Beatrice Chapter. Ron also served on the Virginia and Lewiston School Boards for many years. Ron loved the outdoors and enjoyed fishing and camping at Milford and Harlan County Lake with family and friends. His favorite hobby was attending the many sporting events of his daughters and grandchildren over the years. He also enjoyed trips to the casino, traveling, bowling, gardening, and playing cards. Ron will be remembered as a loving husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather and friend to many. His ornery spirit and big, generous heart will be missed. He never missed an opportunity to provide a helping hand or met a child that he did not offer a dollar to buy candy or a bottle of pop.

Yes, it's a great question. It is another step in the process. If you really follow the long Boot Barn for eight or 10 years, we were Western only, then we added work, then we added Wonderwest, which was this sort of very contemporary fashion segment. And now we've said, all right, let's look at the customers in one big concentric circle around our core western customer. And this person wears boots and jeans, but wears T-shirts, matte woven shirts, wears baseball hats and now cowboy hat, and you're right, the addressable market there is quite a bit larger than the addressable market for sort of the pure Western lifestyle customer. In terms of where we think the sales will come, I think a portion of it will be coming back to that share of wallet concept with our existing customers. If you walk into our stores now or even over the last few quarters, particularly on the ladies side, ladies apparel, we've expanded quite a bit around a core western customer and have brought in some more casual fashion. And I think the assortment there is built quite nicely. I think more recently, the men's side has done the same. So part of it is share of wallet with our current customers. We're also changing how we go after new customers and -- from a media mix standpoint, from the stations and channels that we market on, from some of the Adwords that we buy, on pay-per-click, how do we prospect for new customers. That tends to take longer, of course, and tends to be a little bit more expensive to get that new customer. But I think we can do it. And if you were to look at our same-store sales growth for the last two years, almost every single quarter, at least prior to COVID, a really healthy contributor to our same-store sales growth was an increase in customer count on a comp store basis. And frankly, this is an extension of that strategy. And ironically, we're somewhat fortuitous that we're bringing this more casual assortment to the stores at a time when the customer has started to move in that direction anyway. So it's -- there's -- we're pretty pleased with the progress so far, but really encouraged by the outlook because I think it fits well with where the customer is. I can't say that we planned that nine months ago when we started this, but once in a while, you get lucky.

“So many people are standing with the students at Paducah Tilghman,” Marks added.
 People throughout Paducah are also showing their support for Shively, acknowledging how the photo is offensive. Shively claims the photo was taken in 2002 at a Halloween party.
 Marks believes there needs to be extensive change to the school district’s leadership, in order for members of the community to move past the issue.
 “To the kids that are walking out, I 100% support them, and I say keep doing it until there is change,” Marks said. “Because at the end of the day those are the kids right now that are in this school system and (they have) to deal with this.

“Through Congressman Higgins' advocacy and this funding opportunity, our partners from Community Mission and Pinnacle community services will be able to expand their reach and help us have a positive impact on the teens and young adults struggling in our community,” Lockport Mayor Michelle Roman said.


  Erie and Niagara counties received a total of more than $3.59 million from HUD’s Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program. The award winning proposal was developed by a coalition of local social service providers, including the youth action board, which is made up of young people with firsthand experiences with homelessness.


  Together, they crafted a "Coordinated Community Plan for Ending Youth Homelessness." The plan noted that about 750 unaccompanied and parenting youth in the region experience homelessness annually and another 1,600 are at risk of becoming homeless.


  “These federal resources will help build a stronger support system toward the goal of making sure Niagara County’s young people have a safe place to call home,” Higgins said.


  Community Missions will receive $850,468 to administer joint transitional- rapid rehousing services to youth ages 18 to 24 in Niagara County. The project will provide housing support through a transitional housing site in the Falls, then proceed to a rapid rehousing program to help youth obtain their own apartment in the community.


  Support will include intensive case management, life skills development and linkages to counseling, education, workforce training and employment.


  "Young adults in this age bracket are generally too old for children’s services and often skeptical about entering full adult services once away from home," Robyn Krueger, president and CEO of Community Missions, said. "This demonstration project offers the opportunity to have grounded support in a safe and dependable environment from caring staff members while making these important life transitions and decisions."


  Pinnacle Community Services will support a Family Engagement Team, with the help of $370,182 in federal funding. The team will serve youth between the ages of 12 and 24 in Niagara County, focusing on providing family mediation and wrap-around case management to help youth quickly resolve their homelessness or divert them from experiencing homelessness.


  The team's goals include building permanent connections between youth and their chosen family and providing linkages to mental health and substance abuse treatment.


  "For youth to have success in not only getting secure housing but maintaining a home, it is imperative to have opportunities to learn the skills they need," Laura Pennington Gawel, president and CEO of Pinnacle Community Services, said. "When appropriate, the program will provide employment support, budgeting tools, and assistance in obtaining benefits to provide stability and connections that support each youth."


  Pinnacle will also collaborate with local schools districts, county social services and the justice system to identify youth at risk of experiencing homelessness.

El Gobierno nacional definió hoy que la nueva ronda del programa de Asistencia a la Producción y el Trabajo (ATP7) mantendrá el esquema solo para los sectores críticos, mientras que el resto podrá acceder a un crédito a tasa subsidiada, para los cual se revisó a la baja el nivel de facturación negativa que pasará del 40% al 35%.   Así se resolvió en la reunión de gabinete económico que se desarrolló en el Salón de los Científicos de Casa de Gobierno, en la que se analizaron las características que tendrá en su séptima ronda el programa que se hará efectivo en noviembre como pago complementario de los salarios de octubre.   La inscripción a esta nueva ronda del ATP estará disponible a partir del jueves 29 de octubre, a través de la página de la AFIP.   El jefe de Gabinete, Santiago Cafiero, encabezó la reunión de la que participaron los ministros de Economía, Martín Guzmán; de Desarrollo Social, Daniel Arroyo; y de Trabajo, Claudio Moroni, junto al presidente del Banco Central, Miguel Pesce; la directora de la AFIP, Mercedes Marcó del Pont; y la vicejefa de Gabinete, Cecilia Todesca Bocco.   Además de terminar de definir las condiciones de la séptima edición del ATP, en el encuntro se analizó también la cuestión cambiaria y la posibilidad de una continuidad del Ingreso Familiar de Emergencia (IFE), de acuerdo con lo informado oficialmente.   El ministro de Economía destacó que “el ATP es una herramienta fundamental para sostener a las empresas, el trabajo y el saber hacer de la economía”.   “Dirigir los esfuerzos del Estado a sostener a los sectores productivos nos permite reducir el impacto de la crisis sobre la actividad económica y, de este modo, colaborar con una recuperación más promisoria”, enfatizó Guzmán.   En declaraciones a la prensa, Todesca Bocco explicó que la "recuperación económica" tiene "dos velocidades, una que es para los sectores no críticos donde ya se ven niveles de recuperación en algunos casos anteriores al impacto de la pandemia, y en otros que están muy cerquita".   "Pero hay un conjunto de sectores que todavía no se pudieron recuperar que tienen que ver con las medidas sanitarias. Son los que denominamos sectores críticos como entretenimiento, turismo o gastronomía en los que se va a concentrar el esfuerzo fiscal", añadió la funcionaria.   Con ese análisis de la situación de las empresas, el gabinete decidió que a esos sectores críticos -turismo, cultura, entretenimiento y gastronomía- con facturación nominal negativa se les asegurará el pago complementario de los salarios en forma de subsidio.   En tanto, los sectores no críticos pasarán a contar con la posibilidad recibir créditos con garantía y estatal y subsidio de tasas pero cuando la empresa tenga una facturación de entre 0% y 35% respecto a igual período del año pasado.   En ese punto se anota otra de las modificaciones, ya que hasta el momento las empresas que podían acceder a los créditos a tasa subsidiada debían demostrar una caída de facturación de 0% a 40%, decisión que responde a que el aporte se rige por la inflación interanual que está en 36% de acuerdo con el Indec.   Sobre el futuro del IFE, sostuvo que la continuidad de la ayuda sigue siendo tema de "discusión" dentro del equipo económico, aunque señaló que lo que observan es que hay "un nivel de recuperación" sostenido en la "circulación de las personas".   "Queremos ver cual es la mejor manera de invertir esos recursos y creemos que tenemos que diseñar políticas mas focalizadas", agregó la funcionaria esta tarde.   El IFE fue diseñado en un momento de la pandemia en que la gente no podía salir de su casa, pero hoy el Gobierno advierte que "hay otro contexto, los trabajos se recuperaron y también los trabajos de la informalidad, y es necesario poner los recursos donde realmente se requieren".

There was no Cristiano Ronaldo on the field and no fans in the stands to see Barcelona and Lionel Messi beat Juventus 2-0 away in the Champions League on Wednesday. Ronaldo's lingering COVID-19 case prevented a first meeting between him and Messi in the group stage of a competition they have combined to win nine times. Barcelona took an early lead in Turin through Ousmane Dembele and had plenty of chances to seal the win long before Messi scored a penalty as 90 minutes ticked over into stoppage time.Marcus Rashford scored a hat trick as Manchester United beat Leipzig 5-0 at home, while Chelsea brushed aside Krasnodar 4-0 in Russia, giving England's four clubs a sweep of wins this week without conceding a goal. A wave of second-half goals also earned wins for Paris Saint-Germain -- after losing Neymar early to injury -- Borussia Dortmund and Sevilla.Some of the gloss went out of the Juve-Barca game -- the repeat of a standout final in 2015 -- when Ronaldo was ruled out in the morning. His virus infection was revealed more than two weeks ago while on international duty with Portugal.Barcelona quickly pushed back the Italian champion and Antoine Griezmann's shot struck a post in the second minute. The lead arrived in the 14th from Dembele's deflected, looping shot. Barcelona's forwards were often hesitant and wasteful, with even Messi missing the target with a clear shooting chance on his left foot.Juventus officially had no shots on target yet its No. 9 Alvaro Morata had a hat-trick of goals disallowed for offside calls. The third would have leveled in the 55th but was ruled out more than two minutes later after a video review.Also in Group G, Ferencvaros and Dynamo Kyiv missed the chance to join Juventus on three points by drawing 2-2 in Budapest before a crowd of 6,171. Ferencvaros coach Serhiy Rebrov, who played and coached at Dynamo, saw his team fall two down in the first half, then earn a point with substitute Franck Boli's 90th-minute strike.ROMAN IN RUSSIAChelsea's Russian owner Roman Abramovich used his team's trip to his home country to make a rare visit to see a game. Abramovich, whose British visa was withdrawn in 2018 during diplomatic tensions with Russia, was rewarded with a 4-0 win in Krasnodar.Chelsea's players are not used to seeing their owner, nor any fans at games. There were 10,544 spectators in the first paying crowd Chelsea has played for since the coronavirus pandemic was declared in March.Hakim Ziyech, in his first start for the 2012 European champion, scored in a late burst of goals. Another expensive summer signing, Timo Werner, scored a penalty after regular taker Jorginho missed from the spot in the 14th. United States international Christian Pulisic came off the bench to score in stoppage time.Sevilla, who drew 0-0 at Chelsea last week, also has four points in Group E after beating Rennes 1-0.KEAN STEPS UPItalian forward Moise Kean's goals lifted Paris Saint-Germain to a 2-0 win at Istanbul Başakşehir after Neymar limped off with a muscle strain. Kean, who is on loan to PSG from Premier League leader Everton, scored in the 64th and 79th minutes. After two goals in the French league at the weekend, Kean already matched his goals tally for all of last season in England.For a game between teams owned by the government of Turkey and the state of Qatar, PSG wore a uniform in the maroon of Qatar's national flag. The official attendance was 350.REGAL RASHFORDManchester United's Rashford has had a stunning October on and off the field, leading a campaign against child poverty that embarrassed the British government. Rashford, who scored the winning goal at PSG last week, came off the bench to score a late hat trick and seal United's 5-0 rout of Leipzig, a semifinalist last season.Another homegrown young forward, Mason Greenwood, opened the scoring in the first half and Anthony Martial scored a penalty. United leads Group H with a maximum six points, three ahead of PSG and Leipzig.YOUNG STARSBorussia Dortmund's coveted young forwards Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland both scored late to beat Russian champion Zenit St. Petersburg 2-0. Neither game in Group F was played with fans in the stands, and Lazio traveled to Belgium with barely enough first-team players due to a COVID-19 outbreak at the club.Lazio still earned a 1-1 draw at Club Brugge to give both four points, one clear of favored Dortmund with top-seeded Zenit last after two defeats.

HIBBING — The Housing and Redevelopment Authority (HRA) of Hibbing has proposed a program that could help tenants in federally-subsidized housing find employment and educational opportunities as a push to redefine housing assistance as a pathway to financial independence.
 Created in 1996, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Moving to Work program provides flexibility to the Hibbing HRA to now consider a self-sufficiency program to include reducing income recertifications and imposing work requirements on a case-by-case basis on tenants in public housing deemed fit to work.
 The local program would be tailored to 91 out of 401 tenants residing in the HRA’s four buildings in Hibbing. The rules would be aimed at non-disabled residents between ages 18 to 62.
 “We want to improve the quality of life for our residents,” Jackie Prescott, the executive director of the Hibbing HRA, told a group of elected politicians, public officials and stakeholders during a presentation Tuesday outside of her office on 7th Avenue East. Andrew Jarocki, a Lead for America fellow serving with the HRA, added, “The goal is not to clear out the building. We want to work with the tenants to ask, ‘What do you need? What’s holding you back from becoming economically self-sufficient?’”
 The pair said they are accepting public comments until Nov. 23, before submitting a final version of their Moving to Work plan to HUD for approval. Their hope is to get the greenlight in the upcoming months and hit the ground running in 2021.
 The Hibbing HRA, established in 1948, provides public housing citywide to low- income individuals and families that meet federal government guidelines. The mayor of Hibbing appoints five citizens to serve as commissioners on the HRA Board.
 Today, 401 tenants live at Park Terrace Manor, Seventh Avenue, Haven Court and First Avenue Apartments. Many are considered eldery and have access to supplemental social security. Some have part-time or full-time jobs, while others do not have a form of employment. Their rents and utilities are based on 30 percent of their total household gross income.
 As they have in two previous town hall meetings, Prescott and Jarocki reported that 90 percent of their 401 tenants in Hibbing now earn less than $46,000, including dozens of families. Fifty-two percent of their tenants reside in public housing for at least three years.
 In recent years, HUD expanded its Moving to Work program to dozens of cities across the country. An agency in Lawrence-Douglas County, Kansas, recently celebrated moving its 100th family from public housing to private home ownership, Jarocki noted during the presentation to highlight examples of successfully run programs. Residents in Champaign, Ill. experienced a nearly 30 percent increase in average earned income.
 In 2018, Prescott applied to the Moving to Work program to be considered for implementation in Hibbing.
 That same year, the City of Hibbing reported that the rate of families in poverty more than doubled between 2000 and 2016, from 8.1 percent to 16.9 percent, according to data from the U.S. Census and American Community Survey, as shown in the city’s comprehensive plan in 2018. That was compared to the poverty levels in St. Louis County at 9.1 percent and Minnesota at 6.9 percent.
 On Tuesday, Prescott, now in her seventh year of leading the Hibbing HRA, reported that the local housing authority has now been chosen for the Moving to Work program, which would be “granted flexibility from some federal housing regulations in order to develop and test new strategies to help families.”
 According to the Moving to Work draft, the Hibbing HRA is applying for specific waivers to include reducing income recertifications. The idea is that an individual would not have to go through recertification of their income every time they get more shifts at their job and would, in turn, experience a delay before their rents are increased. Under the new rule, individuals would recertify their income every two years in an effort to “encourage increases in earnings and allow for tenants to increase savings.”
 A second waiver requires quarterly check-in meetings with tenants in the program “to ensure that personal goals are articulated and the HRA understands how it can help provide any resources or remove any barriers.”
 A third waiver requires tenants in the program to work up to 15 hours a week. Though their mission is to help tenants achieve self-sufficiency, Prescott and Jarocki said the program comes with the caveat that individuals who do not abide by the rules are subject to eviction. They would work with tenants on a case-by-case basis, but, ultimately they would help people find different places to live in the region if they were non compliant. “It will only be successful if they want to work with us,” Andrew said.
 Despite the benefits of economic self-sufficiency, the seven staff members of the HRA, along with Jarocki, whose fellowship in Hibbing runs for two years, realize they “are performing a tight-rope act of trying to help tenants find jobs and educational opportunities while avoiding the kind of social work that is beyond the capabilities of a small agency,” Jarocki said.
 He continued, “This program allows us the opportunity to enact locally-driven policy innovation. We are excited to learn what works and what doesn’t work to help our residents reach self-sufficiency.”
 Prescott and Jarocki have partnered with numerous agencies including Arrowhead Economic Opportunity Agency, Range Mental Health Services, Hibbing Community College, Careerforce Center and North St. Louis County Habitat for Humanity to help them provide resources to tenants.
 During the presentation, State Sen. Dave Tomassoni, of Chisholm, St. Louis County Chair Mike Jugovich and Hibbing City Councilor Jennifer Hoffman- Saccoman expressed support for the HRA helping tenants achieve economic self- sufficiency. “The current way [public housing] is done is a total disincentive for people to get out,” Tomassoni said. “This will be a successful program.”

Having assembled a stellar cast, including Olga Kurylenko ( _The Water Diviner_ ), Riccardo Scamaracio ( _The Summer House_ ), and Alex Lawther ( _The Imitation Game_ ), Régis Roinsard has directed a thriller built on intelligently plotted mystery. Not strictly a whodunnit, in the sense that important scenes fool the audience rather than any character taking part in them, _The Translators_ uses the ransom demand as a springboard for events part cat and mouse and part simple misdirection. Angstrom’s desperation to uncover the perpetrator builds tension steadily and, as you hope for in a mystery, leads through a series of amusing twists, turns, and plummeting fortunes to a resolution that will leave you thinking the story through but satisfied that the necessary sleight of hand has treated you fairly.

Now, the lack of a proper in-canal fit had me skeptical about how effective the active noise cancellation (ANC) on these buds would really be. They sound good for open-type earbuds (like the AirPods) and much like the Buds+, have a decent amount of detail and bass for the design, and the soundstage is spacious. Really deep bass and super detailed audio is where the Buds Live are found lacking, but they're good or everyday listening to Bollywood or hip-hop. It's in sound cancellation, both passive isolation (with a good seal) and active noise cancellation that these buds fall short - the bar for ANC on truly wireless earbuds is set pretty high by the AirPods Pro and the Sony WF-1000XM3, and the open fit design just can't match up.  There is a discernable reduction in noise, but some amount of background noise manages to leak in.

“He’s a great role model for English players my age. To get praise and encouragement from him means a lot to me. That helps me a lot.”


  The praise and admiration with which Bellingham speaks about Sancho is emblematic of a player whose social conscience is almost as strong as his footballing ability.


  Chelsea could have done with a player of this calibre, both in terms of personal responsibility and outstanding natural ability this summer, but it is not one that Blues supporters should be kicking themselves about missing out on.


  Sancho was an unattainable prize for most clubs, even despite Chelsea’s expenditure reaching £250 million this summer. The acquisition of Kai Havertz could ultimately prove to be a more fruitful buy, as could Timo Werner – both players who went toe-to-toe with Sancho in the goalscoring charts in the Bundesliga over the past two seasons.


  The expression, ‘the grass is greener on the other side’, springs to mind as wanting after a settled version of Sancho while Havertz and Werner are still adjusting to their new surroundings does not take into account that even elite footballers take time to adapt.


  On a personal level, Chelsea do have a flourishing academy set-up, but there are few players younger than Sancho currently in Chelsea’s first-team squad. The 2000-born England winger is junior to almost every Blues player barring Callum Hudson-Odoi and Billy Gilmour, who he would be more of a peer to, rather than a big brother.


  The impact he has on Bellingham’s integration will undoubtedly be a positive one, and Bellingham’s words speak volumes about Sancho’s acknowledgement of how difficult adapting to a new culture as a 17-year-old may be.

She wrote It all begins and ends at you.

Talking about her character, the actor, who has previously acted in PK 2014 and Love Games 2016 , says, I am strict and stern, but the humour in my character is brought out by Mariam, my youngest daughter. However, I don t think I can ever be strict with my real daughter Aisha. We assume then that she isn t an adherent of the philosophy, spare the rod and spoil the child . She instantly agrees, I don t hit my daughter. I did once, when I saw her playing with an electric socket. She insisted on putting a hanger in it, and I got scared. She was barely five.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is painting an apocalyptic portrait of American life if Democrat Joe Biden gets elected. The president claims that if the Democrat takes over, the suburbs wouldn’t be the suburbs anymore, the economy would slump into its worst depression ever and police departments would cease to exist. Even older Americans would be left to manage without heat, air conditioning or electricity. Campaign rhetoric often becomes heated and hyperbolic as candidates scrap for every last advantage before the votes are counted. Experts say instilling fear in one’s opponent is usually the primary motivating factor behind it.

And I would expect -- that, as Michael said, I mean the mix of the COVID tailwinds can have some variability to it. The second quarter was really strong for a lot of the diagnostic testing, as we said. And Michael was referencing the different testing types. We had some benefit from the serological testing in the second quarter that contributed to the 500 to 600 basis points. As you look at the third quarter, I mean the serological piece of it fell off a bit just because of the mix in what the market is using. But by the same token, overall testing volumes have increased as we head into the fourth quarter. We saw some good order activity in the tail end of the third quarter. So we expect that mix to kind of move back to a little bit more on the diagnostics side. The biopharma production piece of it has been really strong. So it's hard to say what the exact precise tailwinds would be. But I would expect somewhere in the Q2 to Q3 kind of range somewhere in those dynamics.

Sure. So on the mix, in our third quarter, in our holiday quarter, we just think of work versus Western. Work does decrease slightly as a percent of the total business, and Western becomes a little bit more because it's a little bit more gifted than the work business. And we're not exactly sure how that will play out, right? The work boots business is very strong. The FR work apparel is very weak. So it could almost offset, maybe not quite, but the mix might be a slight headwind to same-store sales, although I think we have some other things that are maybe pushing from a tailwind perspective. In terms of the new capabilities that were built, right now, they are a very small portion of our business. We built them out because it's -- it can be additional sales, it can be margin accretive versus a regular e-commerce business -- e-commerce sale. If it's a product that's already in the store and the customer is going to pick it up, we can save the freight piece that Greg spoke about earlier. And the other pretty significant reason that we really wanted to have every possible omnichannel capability built out that we could was, in the downside scenario where COVID surges tremendously and local or state governments take significant action with curtailing store traffic or store hours, we wanted to have sort of every hedge possible against that to help bolster the business, if we did have to shut down in a market or we did have to curtail store hours or curtail the number of people in a store during the holiday period. So we built the ability to, you can buy from the local store and have it shipped directly to your house or delivered directly to your house that day by delivery service. You have the ability to order a gift for somebody across the country and have it delivered to them from the store local to them. And all those capabilities came together extremely quickly and hats off to the e-comm and the IT team for getting them up and running and working with very, very little speed bumps in the process.

UCT delivered another solid quarter of revenue and profitability, thanks in large part to the exceptional commitment and innovation of our team members around the world and ongoing strength in the semiconductor market. All our facilities are running smoothly, which enabled us to again exceed customer expectations for quality and on-time delivery. Our Products division saw an increase in business from nearly all customers, and we secured a sizable new award from one of our main customers, as they continue to work with us to meet their outsourcing needs. In addition, we were designated as an approved design and production partner for a major lithography company and continue to win manufacturing awards on our next- generation tools. This new designation enables UCT to add value early in the design and development process of the new systems.

The number of absentee ballots — about five times greater than the 2016 general election — can be at least partially attributed to a tent set up outside Town Hall. There, the process has been streamlined per a suggestion from state officials, according to Goodnow.
 “Registered voters can come and request an application for an absentee ballot and be given one,” he said. “They can fill it out and cast it. If they’ve already sent out for one, they can bring the ballot they got in the mail and cast it in the tent.”
 The absentee voting center will remain at Town Hall until 4 p.m. Monday — the eve of the election.
 “If people are concerned about COVID, waiting in long lines, et cetera, this is an excellent opportunity for them to beat the rush,” Goodnow said.
 An emergency order handed down to local officials allows for partial pre- processing of the early ballots, but each must go through the same machines used by in-person voters on election day.
 Goodnow explained the town is permitted to open the outer envelopes of absentee ballots, attach a request for the ballot to each, and highlight a voter’s name on the checklist. All ballots are stored in a secure location until they are counted Tuesday.

SYDNEY, Oct 29 (Reuters) - New Zealand coach Ian Foster joked on Thursday he had told his players to steer clear of Steve Hansen in case the former All Blacks boss tries to convince them to switch codes and join him at the National Rugby League's Canterbury Bulldogs.


  Hansen, who stepped down after 16 years with the All Blacks following the 2019 World Cup, was appointed by the Bulldogs on a short-term deal as a "high performance consultant".


  He will work with the coaches, management staff and the players' leadership group, the NRL team said.


  "I'm excited for him. I'm sure he will do that stuff really, really well," Foster told reporters on Thursday after naming his side for their Tri-Nations clash with the Wallabies.


  "I have told him that I've banned our backs from taking any calls from him," Foster added with a laugh.


  The message, however, did not appear to get through to utility back Jordie Barrett.


  "I have been checking my phone," said a grinning Barrett, who is contracted to New Zealand Rugby until 2022. "Hopefully Steve is going to throw me a nice deal over at the Bulldogs."


  Hansen will combine the NRL role with his Director of Rugby job at Japanese club Toyota.


  "The biggest thing is I'll be that sounding board," Hansen told the Sydney Morning Herald.


  "None of us knows everything. The more we can sit down and share our thoughts and processes with other people we have faith in, the easier the job becomes."


  All Blacks scrumhalf Aaron Smith, who was first picked by Hansen in 2012 and will earn his 95th cap on Saturday, had no doubt Hansen would succeed in the role, but had one request.


  "Hook us up with some tickets, bro," Smith said.

New Zealand haven't had to wrap up the Bledisloe Cup on Australian soil in 11 years and for coach Ian Foster that's a massive motivation to snuff out Wallaby hopes of keeping the series alive when the two sides meet Saturday in Sydney.


  After a 16-16 draw at the opening game in Wellington, it was back to business as usual for the All Blacks at their Eden Park fortress in Auckland, where they won 27-7.


  It means Australia must win on Saturday to stand any chance of lifting the trans-Tasman trophy for the first time since 2002 at the fourth and final game in Brisbane on November 7.


  While the match is the third Bledisloe fixture, it is also the first game of the Tri Nations -- the former Rugby Championship, rebranded after world champions South Africa pulled out -- also including Argentina.


  In the hosts' favour is that New Zealand have not won the Cup in Australia since 2009, and that they have come out on top in two of their previous three matches against them at home, including a 47-26 walloping in Perth last year.


  "None of our players, even our experienced ones, have had to win the trophy in Australia," said Foster ahead of Saturday's game.


  "In the past the deciding game has always been in New Zealand, so I think it's a great challenge for us."


  "It's a real chance for us to come into their home patch, a place which they take a lot of pride in playing and for a trophy which means a lot to them, and we need to show them how much it means to us," he added.


  New Zealand have made three changes to the run-on side, handing number eight Hoskins Sotutu a starting debut, welcoming back veteran lock Sam Whitelock and recalling prop Karl Tu'inukuafe.


  Whitelock returns after missing the Auckland Test with concussion, the same injury that has kept Joe Moody out of Saturday's fixture, opening the way for Tu'inukuafe.


  Sotutu comes in for Ardie Savea, who is on paternity leave, while all eyes will be on their new weapon, young wing Caleb Clarke whose rampaging runs in Auckland sparked comparisons to the great Jonah Lomu.


  Faced with Clarke and the ever-present danger posed by Beauden Barrett, Australia have their work cut out, with coach Dave Rennie desperate for his team to cut down on missed tackles and turnovers.


  \- 'Eye to the future' -


  Australia head into the game without experienced pair Matt To'omua and James O'Connor, who are injured -- potentially a crushing blow.


  Rennie has drafted in debutants Noah Lolesio at fly-half and Irae Simone at inside centre to take their place, while dumping fullback Tom Banks for veteran Dane Haylett-Petty.


  The explosive Jordan Petaia will play his first Test in Australia after being preferred to Hunter Paisami at outside centre, while Allan Alaalatoa got the nod ahead of Taniela Tupou at tight-head prop.


  "We're (keeping) an eye to the future but also about winning on Saturday," said Rennie of his decision to blood new talent, with two other debutants -- Fraser McReight and Tate McDermott -- on the bench.


  "We're working really hard, we're going to get a lot better over time, but you've got to get results now too and we're well aware of the quality of the opposition," he said.


  Because of coronavirus concerns, Australia are hosting the entire Tri Nations. The Wallabies and All Blacks will both play Argentina twice, with the last game on December 5.


  The tournament is going ahead without South Africa's Springboks, who decided they weren't ready for bruising Test matches after a harsh coronavirus lockdown.


  But Argentina, who have spent months in and out of bio-secure bubbles and quarantines, are taking part despite also not playing since the World Cup in Japan last year.

That said, the question persists: What exactly did Trump mean in his tweets about declassifications and the Russia investigation? The Justice Department and Meadows have argued that it is a reference to a 2019 executive order that gave Attorney General William Barr the authority to overrule objections of the FBI and the intelligence community in declassifying documents.


  By and large, that order has helped better inform the public. For example, in May the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released the transcript of former national security adviser Michael Flynn's conversation during the 2016 presidential transition with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. The transcript reinforces Barr's judgment that the FBI lacked an investigative basis to interview Flynn and ultimately charge him with making false statements to the bureau. Other documents give a fuller picture of how some of the FBI agents involved in the investigation were dubious of the theories of prosecutors in the special counsel's office.

State District Judge T. Glenn Ellington cited a slew of bad decisions by both parties that led to a fatal shooting last year in La Puebla before sentencing Adam Lovato, 35, of Española to six years in prison for voluntary manslaughter.
 “In this particular situation, I think a lot of people made some bad decisions,” Ellington said during the livestreamed sentencing hearing Wednesday.
 Lovato shot 39-year-old Ivan Maestas of Alcalde on Sept. 16, 2019, following a dispute at a home in the community north of Santa Fe. He was charged with second-degree murder, tampering with evidence, resisting arrest and possession of a firearm by a felon. But he was sentenced for the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter under a plea deal reached last month.
 Lovato also received an 18-month sentence for a second count. All but about 4½ months of that sentence was credited as time he already has served in jail.
 If convicted of the murder charge, Ellington said, Lovato could have faced close to life in prison.
 A criminal complaint says Maestas had appeared at the property under the influence of alcohol and had been threatening people with a knife. Lovato fired a warning shot, according to the complaint, and then the fatal shot. Maestas was found dead later that night in a vehicle that had been driven from the scene of the crime. No knife was recovered at the scene.
 Lovato and Maestas, the father of a young daughter, had both served time behind bars.
 Deputy Chief District Attorney Blake Nichols and Lovato’s defense attorney, Anna Aragon, agreed that by accepting the plea deal, Maestas’ loved ones and Lovato would be spared from having the men’s previous run-ins with law enforcement dragged out during a jury trial.
 “The benefit to the family is that they do not need to go through a weeklong cavalier defense that would drag Ivan’s name through he mud; they don’t have to risk a case where Mr. Lovato walks free and feels vindicated,” Nichols said.
 “Mr. Lovato, on the other hand, has accepted responsibility,” Nichols added. “This limits his potential exposure. If we would have gone to trial and convicted him as charged, he would be facing twice what he’s looking at with this plea. This was a difficult compromise, I think, for all parties.”
 Prior to his sentencing, Lovato, clothed in a tan jail jumpsuit, told the court he took full responsibility for his actions and was prepared to accept the sentence. He intermittently hung his head throughout the hearing before addressing the court.
 “I understand the plea agreement and understand how much time I’m facing today,” Lovato said. “I just believe that I’m trying to do the right thing and face my actions.”
 Nary Maestas, Ivan Maestas’ mother, told the court Lovato “didn’t have a right to take [Ivan’s] life,” adding that Lovato could have called the police or 911 instead of taking the situation into his own hands.
 Annabelle Lopez, Ivan Maestas’ godmother, questioned why people at the scene didn’t call an ambulance after the shooting instead of loading Maestas into a car and attempting to drive him to a hospital themselves.
 According to New Mexico State Police, someone tried to drive Maestas to Presbyterian Española Hospital, but the vehicle ran out of gas along N.M. 68.
 As part of the sentencing, Lovato will be required to pay restitution to the Maestas family to cover funeral costs.
 Ellington, who shared a personal story of a family member who was killed in Española, recommended the Maestas family seek counseling to deal with the trauma of the shooting.
 “There are things in life that we cannot undue,” Ellington said. “For your own benefit and the benefit of his daughter, who you need to support as she grows up, I ask you to deal with your own pain and trauma so that you’re available emotionally to do that.”

Kyle Busch won the Autotrader EchoPark 500, breaking a yearlong winless string, but also potentially breaking the spirits of teammate Martin Truex Jr. in the process.
 Truex finished second, but that might as well have been the same as finishing 22nd, due to a pre-race penalty that stripped him of 20 points right before the race started. He entered the weekend seventh on the grid and 23 points below the elimination cutline and leaves seventh on the grid and 36 points out.
 The discovery of a modified or unapproved spoiler may have cost them the chance to race for a championship at Phoenix if they can't win at Martinsville on Sunday.
 "I don't see it the same as 20th or 30th," Truex said. "To run second all day long and lead some laps is tough to do. You've got to put yourself in position in the top two or three to win races, and so we were right there. If we'd gone ‑‑ if it was one more lap, the 18 was probably going to run out of gas, so it just was one of those things where we were ‑‑ how close can you get without winning.
 "I'm proud of the effort. Obviously I wish we could have won and we came here to win, but to finish second and say that it may as well be 20th is just ridiculous."
 While the sentiment is admirable, finishing second indeed has the same big picture results as finishing anywhere else after the penalty.
 If Truex had not been penalized, and finished second, he would have been 16 points out with an opportunity to advance on points.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A fast-moving Hurricane Zeta barreled northeast Thursday morning after ripping through Louisiana and Mississippi where storm-weary residents were advised to stay indoors overnight while officials assessed the havoc the storm had wrought.The storm raged onshore Wednesday afternoon in the small village of Cocodrie in Louisiana as a strong Category 2 and then moved swiftly across the New Orleans area and into neighboring Mississippi, bringing with it both fierce winds and storm surge. There was heavy rain at times but since the storm was so fast-moving, rain related flooding wasn’t as much of a concern.The storm killed at least one person, a 55-year-old man who a Louisiana coroner said was electrocuted by a downed power line in New Orleans, and officials said life-threatening conditions would last into Thursday.Waveland Mayor Mike Smith told WLOX-TV that his Mississippi Gulf Coast city, which was part of the area most heavily damaged by 2005′s Hurricane Katrina has maybe taken the worst hit since then from Zeta.“We’re going to see a whole lot of damage in the morning,” Smith said. Among the many trees blown down was one that fell on Smith’s own house. “It was my next-door neighbor’s and he wanted to give it to me, apparently,” Smith said.In Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards was expected Thursday to tour the coastal regions hardest hit by the storm. During a radio interview Wednesday evening, Edwards said the wind had caused extensive structural damage. And as neighbors and church groups started reaching out to help those affected, he also highlighted the need to protect against the coronavirus at the same time.“Offer the help but do it with a mask on,” he said.Much of New Orleans and the surrounding area was without power Wednesday night. The storm packed a punch as it whipped through the city. Signs outside bars and restaurants swayed back and forth in the wind and palm trees along Canal Street whipped furiously. Officials said a person was hospitalized with minor injuries after a structure collapsed.More than 200 trees were reported down in the city. Echoing a plea made by officials across the Gulf Coast in the dark hours after the storm passed, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell implored residents to stay home and let city officials assess the damage.“Although we have made it through, we have been damaged, we have been hit,” she said.Along coastal Louisiana, there were reports of some trailers flipped over, a gas station destroyed, and downed power lines and trees.Zeta had top sustained winds of 110 mph (177 kph) as a Category 2 hurricane at landfall and is the 27th named storm of a historically busy Atlantic hurricane season — with over a month left to go. It set a new record as the 11th named storm to make landfall in the continental U.S. in a single season, well beyond the nine storms that hit in 1916.Zeta weakened to a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph (144 kph) as it moved into southern Mississippi a few hours after landfall.As much as 5 feet of Gulf water surrounded a casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, and deputies in Harrison County, Mississippi, received multiple calls from people who had remained in mobile homes that were threatened by winds.In the small coastal town of Bay St. Louis in Mississippi, former mayor Les Fillingame said the storm was “very intense” when it blew through.“It was a noisy storm. It was a truly howling wind,” he said, but said thankfully it was also fast-moving. “It was a lot of wind for several hours which is enough.”Tropical storm warnings were issued as far away as southern Virginia, highly unusual for the region. Forecasters issued a string of tornado warnings for as far east as the Florida Panhandle.New Orleans was in the warning areas of six previous storms that veered east or west this season. This time, Zeta stayed on course. Officials had been worried about the loss of a power from a turbine that helps power the city’s aging drainage infrastructure and whether that would leave the city vulnerable to flooding but Zeta’s swift movement meant flooding wasn’t an issue.On Tuesday, Zeta raked across Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, toppling trees and briefly cutting power to more than 300,000 people but causing no deaths.It then regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico along a path slightly to the east of those of Hurricane Laura, which was blamed for at least 27 deaths in Louisiana in August, and Hurricane Delta, which exacerbated Laura’s damage in the same area weeks later.The deteriorating weather prompted early voting sites to close for hours in the western Florida Panhandle. One voter in Mississippi worried about how long felled trees and debris might block roads.“With the election I just kind of hope the city gets the roads clear by November 3rd so everybody can get out and vote,” said Mackenzie Umanzor, of D’Iberville, Mississippi.An average season sees six hurricanes and 12 named storms. This extraordinarily busy season has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.And the fact that so many of the storms have been concentrated in such a small piece of Gulf Coast real estate has meant repeated damage for some places. On Dauphin Island, Alabama, Mayor Jeff Collier said residents and workers had nearly finished cleaning up from Hurricane Sally when the wind started blowing and the water started rising yet again.“This is going to put his back to square one again,” Collier said.___Plaisance reported from Laffite, Louisiana.

Bongani Zungu has revealed how he got up to speed on Rangers as he quarantined following his loan move from French side Amiens.
 The South Africa international had two weeks alone in a Glasgow hotel before his first training session with his new team-mates on Wednesday, ahead of the Europa League tie against Lech Poznan at Ibrox.
 Zungu, 28, is unlikely to start against the Polish club on Thursday but is glad to get his Rangers career up and running.
 He said: “The two weeks was OK, the club helped me to really get things done.

This is a column by Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr.
   
 Ensuring that all Georgians have safe access to food and other essentials has been a top priority for my office from day one of the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, we acted quickly to protect consumers from price gouging and scams by establishing open lines of communications with retailers and other businesses.
   
 Behind the scenes, another issue is worsening, and, unfortunately, many Georgians may unknowingly allow it inside their homes: organized retail crime. Organized retail crime is another name for groups of criminals stealing mass quantities of merchandise from stores and then selling those stolen goods online, and it is a growing problem.
   
 Organized retail crime impacts 97% of retailers in Georgia. Last year, Dunwoody police, who say the bulk of the service calls they receive every day are related to theft, conducted two sting operations in partnership with the Georgia Retailers Organized Retail Crime Alliance that resulted in the arrest of more than 40 people. Home Depot has reported instances of criminals stealing carts full of merchandise, shoving employees aside in the process.
   
 Such criminal activity exposes Georgia retail workers to potentially dangerous encounters, puts consumers at risk of unknowingly purchasing expired and defective goods from online marketplaces and threatens the health and growth of local businesses. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security has warned about the dangers posed to the public.
   
 Organized retail crime is also a kingpin for other criminal operations. The International Criminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL, has said that there is a direct link between organized retail crime and human trafficking, drug trafficking, corruption, bribery and money laundering.
   
 Through many efforts, including our Georgia Anti-Gang Network, statewide law enforcement officials are stepping up to curb this syndicated behavior, and it is important to note that these efforts do more than put bad actors behind bars -- they can potentially save lives.
   
 But despite our success to date tracking down bad actors involved in organized crime rings, there remain loopholes that enable some bands of criminals to go undetected by exploiting lax oversight by online marketplaces.
   
 Congress can help us solve this problem by creating federal standards that prevent criminals from anonymously selling stolen products online and give state law enforcement agencies the information they need to identify who these sellers are and bring them to justice.
   
 One proposed solution [schakowsky.house.gov] lawmakers are considering would make it far more difficult for thieves to fly beneath the radar on online marketplaces. The bill, known as the INFORM Consumers Act, would require those looking to set up accounts on e-commerce platforms to disclose basic information such as their government ID, tax ID, bank account information and contact details.
   
 This would give Georgia law enforcement the ability to quickly and accurately identify criminals and hold them accountable. It is the kind of common-sense solution that will better protect Georgians.
   
 Georgia law enforcement, in partnership with retailers and local businesses, will continue to do everything in its power to protect workers, consumers and local businesses by rooting out organized retail crime wherever it crops up. But, there will continue to be new networks of bad actors so long as they know they can get away with selling stolen goods anonymously online. Congress can help us by passing targeted legislation that closes this loophole.

Yes. Sure. So just on the free cash flow itself, Vijay, just to remind everybody, we started the year with an expectation of $450 million to $500 million in free cash flow. We are already at $582 million through the third quarter. The only unusual thing that's in there, apart from the benefit from the refinancing that we've done -- and that's basically a forward benefit. Not a ton that's come through yet because we actually had to accelerate some interest payments into the third quarter that normally would be paid in the fourth quarter to the tune of about $60 million that we were able to overcome and still deliver that $582 million. But the only unusual item really in there is as part of the CARES Act, we were able to defer some tax payments and some employer tax liabilities, but that's less than $50 million.

No restructuring request from corporate borrowers has been granted as on 30 September, said Axis Bank’s top management in a conference call on Wednesday after announcing the second quarter results.
 If one read between the lines, this doesn’t mean that there are no restructuring requests so far. The bank only said that it hasn’t granted any. It may have received requests and the final restructuring figures will be clear by the end of December.
 What do the bad loan figures look like at the end of Q2? The gross non- performing assets (GNPAs) has been reported at 4.18 per cent as against 4.72 per cent in the preceding quarter.

So at the time we sign the contract, we estimate the value of the contract and we straight line it over the period from signing the license until the unit is up and running. So this provides a steady fairly predictable revenue stream for us at any point in time for signing four or five, six licenses a year and they're taken three to five years, so you can do the math. There's 10, 20 plus licenses in various stages of revenue recognition and you've got milestone payments coming in throughout the year on a number of open licenses at any given time as well.

Country music songwriting icon Billy Joe Shaver died Wednesday in Waco after suffering a massive stroke.


  Shaver, 81, a member of the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame, is best known for his rough and tumble image throughout a career of writing that includes songs Waylon Jennings recorded on his 1973 album, “Honky Tonk Heroes,” and “I’m Just an Old Chunk of Coal,” a 1981 classic turned into a hit by John Anderson.


  Raised in Corsicana and Waco, he wrote from his life which, warts and all, encompassed fast living, hard drinking and a temper, a lifestyle that made him fit in with musicians like Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Jerry Jeff Walker and Kris Kristofferson, the core of the Outlaw Country movement of 1970s Austin.

Pakistan’s state-run council of clerics, which advises the government on religious issues, gave its approval on Wednesday to the construction of a new temple for minority Hindus, ruling Islamic law allows them a place of worship.
 Lal Malhi, a prominent Hindu leader who is also a member of parliament, applauded the ruling but noted the council also recommended the government not spend public funds directly on the construction of private places of worship.
 The decision by the Council of Islamic Ideology comes after the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan abruptly halted construction on the temple in the capital Islamabad in June.
 Mr. Khan’s decision came amid threats from radical Muslims who called construction of the temple a blasphemous act.
 Some extremists had vowed to try to stop the temple’s construction with force, raising tensions. Mr. Khan turned to the council to decide if public money could be used for construction. He had promised $600,000 for the temple’s construction.
 It was not immediately clear on Wednesday whether Mr. Khan would follow through with providing the funds in light of the council’s ruling.
 However, the council’s ruling left open the possibility the money could be distributed to the Hindu community to use as it sees fit.
 Mr. Khan, who has promised equal rights for minorities, is expected to issue a formal order to allow the temple’s construction.
 Currently, there is no functioning temple for Hindus in Islamabad. An ancient temple exists in the capital, but Hindus don’t use it for fear of attacks.
 About 3,000 Hindus live in Islamabad with its population of more than 1 million, mostly Muslims.

When students arrive at Sea Crest’s campus every day, they are immediately asked health screening questions, get their temperatures taken, and are directed to wash their hands at outdoor touchless sinks before heading to class. Every student wears a mask all day long, and social distancing is required, with spaced desks and tape markers to help. Miller said every day, a few kids are turned away for something as simple as a light cold, stomachache or recent travel.
 “There is no wiggle room at all,” Miller said. “We really consider the parking lot our first line of defense.”
 Every classroom on campus has open windows, air filters and an exterior door. The cafeteria is located outside in the “parking lot café,” and students stay in their cohorts all day — even during recess. Younger kids who normally wouldn’t be learning at desks now have their own individual space, and technology has been set up to accommodate everyone.
 The biggest challenge, Miller said, has been for teachers, who are learning how to toggle between the two learning groups.

Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi cast her ballot Thursday ahead of Election Day next week with hundreds of thousands of elderly voters across the country expected to follow suit to reduce the risk of coronavirus.


  Wearing a face mask, rubber gloves and her trademark flowers in her hair, Suu Kyi was one of the first in the country to vote Thursday morning in the capital, Naypyidaw.


  The 75-year-old's National League for Democracy (NLD) is widely expected to be returned to power in the November 8 polls -- only the second election since the nation emerged from outright military rule.


  Thousands of polling stations across Yangon and other areas badly hit by the pandemic opened in advance on Thursday to allow voters over 60 to cast their ballots in a bid to protect them from coronavirus.


  Kyaw Goke, 73, turned out to vote for only the second time in his life, clad in face mask and shield at a downtown booth with chairs laid out to follow strict physical distancing rules.


  "Even if I'm afraid of Covid, I believe voting is necessary," the 73-year-old told AFP.


  "I hope Mother Suu wins. She's been the one protecting us from Covid-19."


  \- Credibility questions -


  Suu Kyi has placed herself front and centre of the nation's efforts to combat the pandemic, giving near daily addresses to implore citizens to follow lockdown measures.


  Experts say her decision to ignore calls for the vote to be postponed is a gamble.


  Her visibility has given the NLD an advantage, but watchdog International Crisis Group said turnout will likely be affected and there could be "serious public health ramifications".


  In 2015, the NLD swept to power in a landslide victory but was forced by the junta-scripted constitution into an uneasy power-sharing agreement with the military.


  Many observers have already written off the credibility of this vote.


  The NLD-appointed election commission has been widely condemned for lacking transparency and bungling logistics, including voter lists and alleged discrimination against Muslim candidates.


  Virtually all the 600,000 Rohinga Muslims remaining in the country are stripped of citizenship and will not be able to vote.


  Further mass cancellations of the election in swathes of ethnic minority areas mean a total of nearly two million are disenfranchised in a country with an electorate of some 37 million.


  "It won't be free and fair. Machinations are in place to assure an NLD victory," said Yangon-based analyst Khin Zaw Win.

Total sales on a constant currency basis were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2019. Our revenue results increased almost 12% on a quarter- over-quarter basis, which reflects the overall improvement in business trends that we have experienced in recent months. Importantly, this sequential growth was well above expectations and exceeded the high end of our sequential growth range we discussed on our second quarter conference call. While we believe we remain in the early days of the global recovery, we're encouraged by the improving trends we experienced during the third quarter. Specifically, after a difficult April, where we saw a sales decline of 20% year-over-year, we saw a modest improvement on a days adjusted basis in May, and then significant improvement in the month of June. However, sales still decreased in the low single digits year-over-year. Our business trends were somewhat choppy throughout the month of July, and we experienced the expected seasonal softness in overall procedure trends during the month of August.

I just wanted to follow backup again around the notion of cross-border volume is going to ex inter-Europe is probably going to drag on for a bit. And so what I'm trying to understand, are going to reconcile a little bit here is the specific opportunities that you might be pursuing, maybe more behind the scenes in order to offset some loss revenue and lost profits. So rather than kind of a very large drop list of products and opportunities. I'm thinking of things like increased authorization rates now that you have a lot more e-commerce cross-border that's happening and that's opening up the funnel for merchants. Are you able to offset some of those lost profit dollars as a result of those types of things? And then how prominently is CyberSource playing in that regard. Thanks

Enerzijds is de scan bedoeld om de „topografie” van het doek te leren kennen, vertelt Robert van Langh, hoofd Conservation & Science van het Rijksmuseum. Maar het is ook bedoeld als nulmeting om in de toekomst mogelijke veranderingen op het schilderij uit 1642 te kunnen zien.


  De komende weken wordt de Nachtwacht stukje voor stukje, in delen van 13 centimeter breed en 10 centimeter hoog, volledig driedimensionaal vastgelegd. De onderzoekers maken hiervoor zo’n 2500 hoge-resolutie scans met behulp van drie camera’s en een projector, gemonteerd op een speciale constructie. De techniek is in deze omvang, resolutie en snelheid nooit eerder toegepast. „We zoeken de grenzen op van wat mogelijk is”, zegt assistent-professor Willemijn Elkhuizen van de TU Delft.


  Met de 3D-scan kan eveneens een levensechte kopie worden gemaakt van een kunstwerk. Rob Erdmann, senior wetenschapper bij het Rijksmuseum, verwacht dan ook dat deze techniek wereldwijd navolging krijgt. „Kunstwerken kunnen worden gestolen, kathedralen branden af. Natuurlijk vervang je nooit het origineel, maar het helpt wel als je precies weet hoe het eruit zag.”


  De wijze waarop Operatie Nachtwacht wordt uitgevoerd, noemt Van Langh uniek en hij verwacht dat het voor een cultuuromslag zal zorgen in de museumwereld. „Dit wordt onze nieuwe werkwijze. Eerst volledig al het onderzoek doen dat nodig is, dan dat beoordelen en je stappenplan bepalen voor de restauratie.” Volgens hem vertrouwen restauratoren nu nog vaak op hun eigen kennis en ervaring als ze aan de slag gaan. Terwijl met de huidige techniek zoveel meer informatie te halen is.


  Volgens Van Langh bevindt het project zich in een spannende tijd. De resultaten van de diverse onderzoeken van het beroemde schilderij komen nu bijna bij elkaar en dat betekent dat er een plan van aanpak voor de restauratie kan worden gemaakt. Tot welke inzichten de onderzoekers tot nu toe zijn gekomen, houdt hij nog even voor zich.


  Naar verwachting begint de daadwerkelijke opknapbeurt van het zeventiende- eeuwse doek begin volgend jaar. Dat is later dan gepland, want vanwege het coronavirus heeft het onderzoek enige maanden vertraging opgelopen.


  Operatie Nachtwacht is de grootste en meest innovatieve restauratie in de geschiedenis van het museum. Het is nog niet duidelijk hoe lang het project duurt.

"We cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death," they said.
 Biden reiterated his opposition to the violent protests in remarks to reporters on Wednesday, saying that "there is no excuse whatsoever for the looting and the violence."
 He also said he'd set up a commission, if elected, to study "how you diminish the prospect of lethal shootings in circumstances like the one we saw." Biden's criminal justice plan would increase oversight of police departments and offer funds to support police reforms at the local level.
 In West Philadelphia, Bishop Dwayne Royster, interim executive director of POWER Interfaith, a group of Pennsylvania religious leaders focused on social justice issues, said he "can't stand the rhetoric coming out of the White House."
 But Royster, who is Black, also said Biden and Harris have work to do to show their support for the Black community. Harris, who served as California's attorney general and San Francisco's district attorney before being elected to the Senate, is viewed by some in the Black community with some suspicion because of her prosecutorial background.
 "I think the community wants healing, but they are also desperate for a change," Royster said.
 Amid this summer's protests, Trump repeatedly sounded a "law and order" mantra. He received the support of several police unions, while repeatedly warning that the suburbs would disappear if he's not reelected because of some Democrats' support for building low-income housing in suburban communities.
 Trump also faced bipartisan outrage after Attorney General William Barr ordered protesters forcibly expelled from Lafayette Park near the White House in June. The park was cleared shortly before Trump walked to nearby St. John's Church to pose for cameras while holding up a Bible. The church had been damaged earlier by a fire amid the protests over police brutality.
 In Delaware County, one of the suburban Philadelphia areas where Trump needs to win over voters to keep Pennsylvania in his column, there's been mixed response to Trump's hard-edged law-and-order message.
 Kevin Hayes, a sales representative who is white, had a handful of Trump campaign signs in the yard of his Springfield home and a "Cops for Trump" sign in his window. He said he "absolutely" agrees with Trump's characterization of the Philadelphia protests.
 "I think it's terrible the way they're treating police in Philadelphia right now. They're not getting any support from the politicians, from the public," Hayes said. "If they have issues with the police, they should give them more money for training, not defund them."
 Scott Brady, 49, another white Springfield resident and Trump supporter, voted for Democrats for most of his adult life, but backed Trump in 2016. He plans to again this year, and says Trump's statements about Philadelphia are spot on.
 "He's right. He is," Brady said, adding that he disagrees with the policies and criminal justice changes advanced by some of the city's Democratic leaders.
 Rick Pierce, a south Philadelphia native who moved to the suburbs a few years ago, was a rock-ribbed Republican but says Trump has tried his patience over the past year. The 65-year-old retiree said he voted for Trump in 2016, but he's had a change of heart this year.
 Pierce, who is white, said he understood why people were upset by Wallace's shooting.
 "By now the police should know better," he said. "He didn't have a gun, he had a knife."

A former official of the US homeland security department injected new drama into a tumultuous presidential race on Wednesday by revealing himself as the "Anonymous" author of a bombshell 2018 Op-Ed chronicling deep disaffection among senior members of the Trump administration.
 Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff to the secretary of homeland security, owned up to the controversial piece and a subsequent book -- A Warning -- that further chronicled the chaos in a blog on Medium. He left the administration last fall, joined Google and is now on leave.
 He has been a strident critic of the president as a TV commentator.
 Trump slammed him as a "sleaze bag" and a "low life" at a campaign rally in Arizona and said, "This guy, in my opinion, he should be prosecuted."
 More vitriol followed from the Trump campaign, which called the disclosure "the least impressive, lamest political 'reveal' of all time".
 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany slammed Tyler as "this low-level, disgruntled former staffer … a liar and a coward".
 In an Op-Ed in the New York Times in 2018, the "Anonymous" author, who was described as a "senior administration official", had written of a widespread "resistance" by senior officials to frustrate parts of the president's agenda they found disagreeable and his "worst inclinations".
 In the blog post on Medium, Taylor conceded writing the Op-Ed anonymously may have been problematic for some, especially because of the seriousness of his assertions, but said by remaining anonymous he "forced the president to answer them (his assertions) directly on their merits … rather than creating distractions through petty insults and name-calling".
 Taylor's reveal added a new and dramatic element into the race that is now in the final stages in which more than a third of eligible voters -- 75 million -- have already cast their ballot through early in-person voting or by mail in an unprecedented turnout before Election Day on November 3.
 Trump held two rallies in Arizona in an effort to hold on to a traditionally Republican state that he had won in 2016, by a reduced margin than the Republican nominee before him, but where he has been trailing his Democrat challenger Joe Biden by a slim but steady margin.
 Biden, who cast his vote with his wife in Wilmington, Delaware on Wednesday will be campaigning in Florida Thursday, as will be Trump.
 Florida is a key battleground state that no successful presidential candidate has not won in recent memory.
 Trump squeaked through with 1.2% victory margin in 2016, but he now trails Biden by 2 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls and 1.5 point in the FiveThirtyEight average.
 The race itself may be slipping out of the president's grip as he trails his Democrat challenger by a margin that has held steadily over past months.
 He is behind Biden by 7.5 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls and 8.9 points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.

 O'Connell was very impressed by the ferocity of the French performance against Wales last week.
 He sees reasons for Ireland to be confident - as long as the maul is refereed properly, as he saw so much illegality in what Les Bleus did in that area.
 But the Grand Slam winner acknowledges Ireland will need to step up massively from the Italy win in the physical stakes against a side that will be hard to win collisions against.
 "The old France raises its head an awful lot, as it did against Scotland and at times against Wales as well," said O'Connell.
 "They do still give you opportunities - whether that be in terms of penalties and general ill-discipline, or else from their defence or their back-field cover.
 "For me, Ireland need to execute a game-plan but also have it in the back of their mind to kick to the corner and take those scoring opportunities.

Public service is to some people an opportunity to enter into politics. Those people only serve themselves. Consider the Democratic candidate for Bedford Supervisor, Stephanie Zarb.


   


  Originally, she applied to be the Republican candidate for state representative. When turned down for that office, she considered school board and finally supervisor. Nothing wrong with not being a "party person," but a public servant knows her passion and her purpose for which her service will be most effective.


   


  She moved to Bedford only months before she ran as a write-in Democratic in August. How can she know what Bedford needs in our government? What was her purpose to jump into politics? Her "self-interests" backers had a purpose, and she is a willing puppet. I applaud her for serving our country, but she has no idea how to lead a Township. She states no vision for Bedford.


   


  On the other hand, Bedford residents hit the jackpot when they elected Paul Pirrone as Supervisor. He is a native and stayed here all his life. My husband taught 40 years in Bedford Schools and many of his students never returned after college. That demonstrates that Paul wants to serve his hometown.


   


  We need people like Paul who wants to improve Bedford instead of leaving. If all of our natives leave, what do we have left? Only those who move in to change Bedford for their own interests. Paul knows the community. He listens and responds to the people. I have served with Paul eight years and I see him put residents first in everything he does. Elected officials must serve not be served. Paul embraces that ideology. We don't always agree, but that is a good thing in government - bring your differing ideas and reach a consensus that is best for the public.


   


  Having lived here 50 years I know we need someone who embraces the history and future of this township. Bedford does not want to be Toledo; but we want to grow economically to better serve the residents and invest our tax dollars here.


   


  Paul is a great advocate for Bedford. He knows other leaders; he looks for opportunities to benefit Bedford. He has been in public service for over 12 years which allows him to know where to get help without having to waste time finding out how township government operates. My vote is for Paul and his experience.

According to folklorist Philip Hiscock, because blue moons, although rare, did happen from time to time, he coined the phrase “once in a blue moon” back in the mid-19th century. That phrase is still in use today.


  Lunar colorations are also part of some songs such as “When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again”, or perhaps readers remember both Elvis Presley’s or Bill Monroe’s version of “Blue Moon Of Kentucky”.


  Hiscock also wrote about a Blue Moon but this one consisted of a “slinky blue liquid in a cocktail glass, one that requires curaçao, gin and perhaps a twist of lemon.” A few of those and you might be seeing several different colors of the moon, not just blue.

Sure. So I think -- it's sort of followed a natural storyline, right, from pure needs-based to the next business that got turned on to positive was something like men's denim, right, somewhat on the Western side, somewhat needs-based, but not perhaps as much as work boots. Then we started to see an improving trend in men's western boots, which is just about flat now, which is great. And it's some need-based, but oftentimes, discretionary spend. And so I can see how it's playing out as customers are now starting to just shop for more traditional clothing and apparel and boots for them or their family. I think the other thing, perhaps giving a little credit to the merchant team and the stores team, is, we have pretty quickly made some adjustments, right? So to give you a few examples, the trends in the business now have tended to be more casual. So rather than button down woven shirts, they're buying more T-shirts, and they're buying things that they might just wear sort of more casually. For example, we believe some of our lace-up work boot sales without a safety toe have been selling because people are using them for weekend hikes and things of that nature. We've also added some pieces to the assortment, right? So we have adjusted to what we're seeing out there. We've expanded a hiking boot assortment in not all of our stores but a good number of our stores. And we're trying to kind of manufacture some sales where we see the consumer taking us. And then the last thing, I give some credit to the stores. Embedded in the comp performance is a nice increase in our units per transaction. Part of that admittedly is selling facemasks and hand sanitizer. But even if you strip that out, we've really had the stores focusing on adding a pair of socks, adding boot care or boot trees to boot purchases, and our units per transaction have helped as well. So I think when you put all that together, while it's still a battle to gain positive same-store sales, particularly in the stores, we are starting to see some really nice momentum across multiple departments, and it's encouraging.

  Oct 29 (Reuters) - With Election Day looming, President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden will both rally supporters on Thursday in the critical battleground state of Florida – campaigning in the same city hours apart and putting their differing approaches to the resurgent coronavirus pandemic on full display.


  Florida, with its 29 electoral votes, is a major prize in next Tuesday's election and a new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Trump and Biden running neck and neck in the state.


  With COVID-19 cases raging across the country, Trump will stage an outdoor rally in Tampa. Thousands of people have crowded together at recent Trump rallies, many eschewing masks despite public health recommendations.


  Biden, in contrast, will hold a drive-in rally later in Tampa where attendees will remain in their cars. He will host a similar event earlier in the day in Broward County in South Florida.


  Opinion polls show Biden with a significant edge nationally, but his lead is tighter in battleground states. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed Trump had essentially moved into a tie with Biden in Florida, with 49% saying they would vote for Biden and 47% for the president.


  More voters said Biden was better suited to handle the pandemic, by a 48%-42% margin, but Trump got higher marks on the economy, 52% to 41%.


  Following his own bout with the coronavirus, the president has conducted a hectic campaign schedule in the days leading up to the election, holding as many as three rallies a day in different states, while Biden has taken a more measured tack - even spending two days this week close to his home base of Delaware.


  More than 75 million people have cast early in-person and mail ballots, according to data compiled by the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida. That is a record-setting pace and more than 53% of the total 2016 turnout.


  In a significant setback for Republicans in two battleground states, the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to block extensions for receiving mail-in votes in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Trump has made unfounded claims that voting by mail, a common practice in U.S. elections, leads to widespread fraud.


  CORONAVIRUS ISSUE


  U.S. stocks tumbled on Wednesday, with the Dow closing at lows last seen in late July, as coronavirus cases soared globally and investors worried about the possibility of a contested presidential election.


  Trump on Thursday will likely be touting new government data on the nation's gross domestic product during the third quarter as the economy tries to claw back from bottoming out earlier in the year at the height of the pandemic.


  While the numbers are likely to show a record jump in growth as compared with the calamitous second quarter of the year, economists have cautioned that a recovery is far from complete.


  Trump plans to return to the Midwest on Friday, campaigning in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. In all, he plans to visit 10 states in the last week of the campaign and will host 11 rallies in the final 48 hours, a campaign official said.


  After a briefing from public health officials on Wednesday, Biden slammed what he called the Trump administration's disregard for safety and failure to develop a plan to contain COVID-19.


  "The longer he's in charge the more reckless he gets," Biden told reporters, before casting his own vote in Wilmington, Delaware.


  Trump, in turn, has accused Biden of wanting to institute new lockdowns across the nation that would further damage the economy, even as the president continues to downplay the threat posed by the virus.


  After his Tampa rally, Trump will head to another key battleground state, North Carolina, to stage an evening event in Fayetteville.


  Biden will travel to Wisconsin on Friday and campaign with former President Barack Obama in Michigan on Saturday, the campaign said. Trump's narrow victories in both states in 2016 helped propel him to the White House.

The Center Square) – The high school basketball season is back on in Illinois.
 A day after Gov. J.B. Pritzker elevated the sport to the “high risk” level, effectively postponing the season, the Illinois High School Association held a special meeting Wednesday to give the green light to proceed despite the governor's order. The Illinois High School Association, or IHSA, governs high school sports in Illinois.
 The IHSA will allow boys and girls basketball to begin practices on November 16, and games can begin on November 30. The IHSA said masks will be worn by all players, coaches and officials during play.
 IHSA Executive Director Craig Anderson said it is important to have basketball during the winter months.
 “Without basketball in the winter, we were going to have a really big hole in our winter season with limited activities for kids,” he said.
 The IHSA left the final decision on basketball to school districts.
 “It will become a local school decision to determine if a school will allow their basketball teams to participate following the guidelines developed by the SMAC,” the association said.
 Pritzker said school districts would be taking a legal risk by allowing basketball.
 “It is unfortunate but they would probably be taking on legal liability if they went ahead and moved beyond what the state has set as the mitigation standard,” Pritzker said.
 The IHSA said basketball could be played safely with changes, such as requiring masks on the court.
 “The IHSA Sports Medicine Advisory Committee (SMAC) offered additional mitigations, such as masks during play and social distancing on benches, that the SMAC believed would allow basketball to be played safely," the association said in a statement.
 It also said it has not seen any evidence to warrant the high-risk designation from the state.
 “The Board remains considerate of rising COVID-19 cases in Illinois and understand the importance of adhering to safety guidelines for the good of all citizens,” the statement said. “However, the Board has not been presented any causal evidence that rising COVID-19 cases make basketball more dangerous to play by the IDPH or any other health organization nationally or internationally.”
 Pritzker on Wednesday said that he was he has been relying on national organizations and physicians to make his decisions.
 “I would suggest that if there’s a difference of opinion, I prefer to error on the side of health and safety,” the governor said.
 He also said that school districts know "what the rules are."
 School district officials will be meeting with athletic directors and coaches in the coming days to formulate a plan for the season.
 Kristen Weikle, superintendent of Unit 5 in Normal, plans to attend a meeting with other superintendents in the area and an IHSA representative on Thursday to find out more about the decision, the district said in a statement.
 “We will then talk with our athletic directors in the coming days and determine our plans,” the district said.
 The IHSA board also approved the winter sport guidance for all low-risk sports, including boys swimming and diving, cheerleading, bowling and gymnastics. Wrestling will be moved to the summer season and will begin in April.

If we move to the Slide 9, EBITDA evolution by businesses, again EBITDA reaches around EUR3 billion in the first nine months, primarily affected by lower energy demand and energy prices compared to the previous nine months, which particularly impacted gas supply and international LNG. It's also worth mentioning the impact of the depreciation of LatAm currencies, which I highlighted before to the tune of EUR151 million in ordinary EBITDA, and again to highlight that this devaluation has not had an impact on mutation and therefore on some of the tariffs. It's also worth noting that excluding the EMPL step down has remained -- remains relatively we're still into that despite the negative scenario regulation, which underscores the stability of the regulated businesses in our performance. Non-ordinary impacts in the first nine months amounted to plus EUR230 million and they mostly correspond to restructuring costs linked to the implementation of the efficiency plan that's close to 180 million and also our current costs from gas contract renegotiation around EUR30 million.

On Sunday, my colleague Ben Smith produced the fascinating back story on the story: how the scoop was supposed to go to The Wall Street Journal, with Trump allies mediating, but then another Trump ally, Rudy Giuliani, handed some of the same emails to The New York Post, with a strange back story about Hunter Biden’s laptop, which in turn led to a Post story, accusations of Russian disinformation and an attempted social-media blackout of The Post. Meanwhile, Journal reporters were unable to pin down if Joe Biden had any role in the deal, Bobulinski threw the story to the wider press, and only right-wing outlets ran with it. In the end, both the Journal and the New York Times covered the story in a dry and cautious fashion, describing the Bobulinski allegations while also stressing the lack of definite evidence of the former vice president’s involvement in any deal.

Total sales on a constant currency basis were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2019. Our revenue results increased almost 12% on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which reflects the overall improvement in business trends that we have experienced in recent months. Importantly, this sequential growth was well above expectations and exceeded the high end of our sequential growth range we discussed on our second quarter conference call. While we believe we remain in the early days of the global recovery, we're encouraged by the improving trends we experienced during the third quarter. Specifically, after a difficult April, where we saw a sales decline of 20% year-over-year, we saw a modest improvement on a days adjusted basis in May, and then significant improvement in the month of June. However, sales still decreased in the low single digits year-over-year. Our business trends were somewhat choppy throughout the month of July, and we experienced the expected seasonal softness in overall procedure trends during the month of August.

A former official of the US homeland security department injected new drama into a tumultuous presidential race on Wednesday by revealing himself as the "Anonymous" author of a bombshell 2018 Op-Ed chronicling deep disaffection among senior members of the Trump administration.
 Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff to the secretary of homeland security, owned up to the controversial piece and a subsequent book -- A Warning -- that further chronicled the chaos in a blog on Medium. He left the administration last fall, joined Google and is now on leave.
 He has been a strident critic of the president as a TV commentator.
 Trump slammed him as a "sleaze bag" and a "low life" at a campaign rally in Arizona and said, "This guy, in my opinion, he should be prosecuted."
   
   
 More vitriol followed from the Trump campaign, which called the disclosure "the least impressive, lamest political 'reveal' of all time".
 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany slammed Tyler as "this low-level, disgruntled former staffer … a liar and a coward".
 In an Op-Ed in the New York Times in 2018, the "Anonymous" author, who was described as a "senior administration official", had written of a widespread "resistance" by senior officials to frustrate parts of the president's agenda they found disagreeable and his "worst inclinations".
 In the blog post on Medium, Taylor conceded writing the Op-Ed anonymously may have been problematic for some, especially because of the seriousness of his assertions, but said by remaining anonymous he "forced the president to answer them (his assertions) directly on their merits … rather than creating distractions through petty insults and name-calling".
 Taylor's reveal added a new and dramatic element into the race that is now in the final stages in which more than a third of eligible voters -- 75 million -- have already cast their ballot through early in-person voting or by mail in an unprecedented turnout before Election Day on November 3.
 Trump held two rallies in Arizona in an effort to hold on to a traditionally Republican state that he had won in 2016, by a reduced margin than the Republican nominee before him, but where he has been trailing his Democrat challenger Joe Biden by a slim but steady margin.
 Biden, who cast his vote with his wife in Wilmington, Delaware on Wednesday will be campaigning in Florida Thursday, as will be Trump.
 Florida is a key battleground state that no successful presidential candidate has not won in recent memory.
 Trump squeaked through with 1.2% victory margin in 2016, but he now trails Biden by 2 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls and 1.5 point in the FiveThirtyEight average.
 The race itself may be slipping out of the president's grip as he trails his Democrat challenger by a margin that has held steadily over past months.
 He is behind Biden by 7.5 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls and 8.9 points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.

Democrats have been buoyed by the turnout among early voters. By Wednesday, 25,000 more Democrats than Republicans had already voted by mail or in person.
 Republicans say they will close that gap with strong turnout on Election Day. The Trump campaign has poured its own resources into Duval County. Trump tried to hold his nominating convention in Jacksonville, until the virus forced him to cancel. Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, as well as two of the president's sons, have made visits, before and after the coronavirus outbreak.
 "The truth is the Democrats came and did the work. They worked hard. They registered voters," said Dean Black, chair of the Republican Party of Duval County. "And meanwhile, our local party had grown complacent and we didn't have an organization that was doing the job that needed to be done. But we do now."
 The area has also been a proving ground for Trump's attempt to peel off some Black voters -- especially Black men -- from Democrats. His campaign opened offices in one of the city's predominantly African American neighborhoods. Online commercials feature African American supporters promoting the president's record, while former NFL great Herschel Walker has served as a surrogate on campaign spots. Some 6,000 Black voters in the county are registered Republicans.
 Social justice activists like Michael Sampson, who founded the Jacksonville Community Action Committee, are wary of both sides -- but especially of Trump.
 "He's been unrepentant in calling Black Lives Matter a terrorist organization ... and all these dog whistles to white supremacy," Sampson said during a recent visit to Friendship Fountain, which lies across the St. Johns River from the city's gleaming skyline. The river cuts through the core of the city and serves as a dividing line between old and new, between the city's mostly Black communities and more affluent white developments.
 Sampson says the Black Lives Matter movement has sharpened Democratic voters' focus on the inequities that have long defined the community.
 "All you knew was that Jacksonville was a racist big city, and it was never going to change -- and that the good old boy system ran Jacksonville, and they will forever run Jacksonville," said Sampson, who is Black.
 "I think that calculus has changed," he said, though he acknowledged that Jacksonville may still be decades behind Atlanta, Charlotte, North Carolina, and other rapidly changing cities of the former Confederacy.
 Other people are more skeptical. Rodney Hurst, a longtime activist, said Jacksonville is "nowhere near where it could have been and should have been."
 Hurst was 16 when a mob of white people began indiscriminately clubbing African Americans in downtown Jacksonville with baseball bats and ax handles 60 years ago on a day that is now remembered as Ax Handle Saturday.
 Hurst, 76, says he doesn't think Jacksonville's leaders have "stood up and said we need to change this. So those who think it's progress, I don't."
 Still, many saw a watershed moment in 2013, when a coalition of activists demanded that the school board, after years of failed attempts, rename a high school that honored Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general and the first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
 More recently, the city's Republican mayor, Lenny Curry, has bucked some party orthodoxy by removing a statue of a Confederate soldier from atop a memorial in a park next to City Hall. He also put in place a mask mandate because of the COVID-19 outbreak. But Curry also has echoed Trump's attacks on the protesters who've called for change to fight racism in policing.
 Black, the local GOP chair, acknowledged that Republicans can no longer take the county for granted, but he rejected the notion that Democrats would take over.
 "We aren't going to let that happen," said Black, whose cattle farming family arrived in the area 10 generations ago, when the Spaniards still ruled.
 But Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only Democrat to win a statewide office two years ago, sees Jacksonville as an area of opportunity for Democrats.
 With more than 8 million votes cast statewide, she beat her Republican opponent by 6,753 votes. In Duval County, she won by a margin of fewer than 3,000 votes.
 "You got to come," she said during a visit to Jacksonville last week. "To understand our state, you come to Duval County."

Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. In today's discussion, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers only. Total revenue for the quarter was $363.3 million, up 5.4% from the prior quarter. Our Products division grew 5.9% to $294.4 million on increased demand from nearly all our customers. Our Services business contributed to $68.9 million, up 3% on increased activity across the board from our IDM and OEM customer base. Total gross margin remains at the higher end of our model at 21% compared to 22% last quarter. The change was due primarily to increased spending on materials and maintenance for our Services business to meet demand, offset by favorable direct labor expenses in both businesses. Products gross margin was 17.5% compared to 17.8% last quarter, and Services margin was 36% compared to 39.3% last quarter. Margins can be influenced by customer concentration, geography, product mix and volume, so you can expect to see variances quarter-to-quarter. Operating expenses were $34.3 million, down from $35.4 million last quarter. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses decreased to 9.4% compared to 10.3% in the prior quarter. Total operating margin for the quarter stayed flat at 11.6% compared to 11.7% in the second quarter. Margins from our Product division improved to 10.8% versus 10.5% in the prior quarter, above our current model of 8% to 10% due to increased volumes and lower operating expenses. Margins from our Services division was 14.9% versus 17.1% in the prior quarter and remains at the high end of our current model at 12% to 15%. The change was primarily due to an increase in expenses for long lead time materials to meet demand.

I am not alone in feeling that elections are less about choosing an appropriate candidate than about throwing the current list of bums out and replacing them with another, perhaps more worthy, crew of public servants. It is said that incumbent candidates have certain advantages, like name recognition, beholden donors and something like momentum; to me they are the ones who must put up or shut up. As the great political philosopher Janet Jackson once sang: "What have you done for me lately?"


  So I did it. I voted. I expressed my opinion in a way that counts. No more barstool muttering or shouting at the television. From that moment until the votes are compiled and counted, I feel exempt from all “paid political announcements” attempting to sway my point of view. This little citizen did what millions of people fought and died for and still do. He did his part in swaying the government to behave in what he thoughtfully regards as his interest.


  He spent 90 damned minutes lined up in the rain and 45 degree weather, socially distant from likeminded citizens, sipping a coffee while momentarily removing the paper face mask keeping him alive and ruing the missed opportunity of not conducting all of this via the U.S. Mail, but he did it. While standing there I could hear some conversation, elsewhere down the line, that was conversation not in English. I hoped it was one of those Hollywood moments in which a naturalized citizen was, like me, lined up and preparing to vote, and he or she understood the gravity, the meaning, the joy in it all.


  So the ragtag proletariat stood in a soggy line circling the polling place and decided if they wanted more of the same from their elected leaders or a fresh, or at least fresher, start. This is America, I could intone as patriotic music swells and the wind catches and unfurls a few dozen flags, motivating endorphin rushes to the brain and the heart to beat faster, from sea to shining sea.

DEAR MISSING OUT: While it isn't unheard of for the wife's parents to take precedence over the husband's, Crystal's behavior does appear to be extreme. It also appears the way she's acting is retaliatory, but the people who must get to the bottom of it are your brother and his wife.

So I can see it being 20%, 25% of our mix, particularly in the grocery business. In terms of managing the planograms behind that. You're right. One of the things I'm trying to avoid us becoming is a super efficient planogram- driven retail business. Because I think if you do the kind of things that I'm familiar with at Tesco back in the U.K. or Walmart here in the U.S., where you get very disciplined about space and faces and items. I think you missed something along the way. So the work that we're doing on our system evolution, and there's a lot going on behind the scenes on that in terms of how to make that work. It's creating a flexibility so that we can be a farmer's market so that we can bring things in and take them out while having discipline in our inventory management behind the scenes. And that's one of the, as Denise talked about the runway is ahead of us. It's one of the runways ahead of us that's going to get its real differentiation. And get a balance of how to make that efficient without becoming, if you like, too boring and sometimes planograms make you too boring.

The Santa Fe Police Department hasn't executed a no-knock warrant in at least 10 years, but it will be prohibited from using the controversial practice under an ordinance unanimously approved Wednesday by the City Council.
 The ordinance also requires Santa Fe police to use body-worn cameras while executing search warrants, which officers are already doing. Police have been using body-worn cameras under a policy that has been in place since 2016.
 "Putting such measures into city ordinance supersedes department policy and would ensure that our department continues with these preferred and best practices as we move forward into the future of public safety," Paul Joye, deputy police chief, wrote in a memo to the council.
 Approval of the ordinance came after the creation of a new task force to examine policing and the role of law enforcement in the city of Santa Fe.
 Only two people spoke during a public hearing on the ordinance, and both were in favor of the legislation.
 Emily Kaltenbach, of the New Mexico Drug Policy Alliance, said Santa Fe is joining a "handful of other municipalities and just a couple of states" across the nation that have banned no-knock warrants outright.
 "This ordinance really is a preemptive move in preventing the potential for serious injury and death of both police officers and our residents," said Kaltenbach, who has been selected to serve on the new task force. "Imagine if [Louisville, Ky.] had passed their ban a year ago. Breonna Taylor would still be with us."
 Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was shot and killed by officers executing a no-knock warrant in March, sparking additional calls for police reform after the killing of George Floyd, as well as the end of such warrants.
 Mayor Alan Webber, who sponsored the ordinance, said the city's policies "line up as very progressive" and demonstrate the police department's commitment "to do the right thing in the right way for the well-being of our residents." The mayor also said the men and women of the police department were in full support of the ordinance.
 "They see its value, and they recognize the way in which policing should take care of people at the same time that we take care of enforcing the laws," he said.

The Dodgers won their first World Series championship since 1988 with a 3-1 victory over Tampa Bay in Game 6 on Tuesday night at Globe Life Field.
 Turner was pulled from the game following the seventh inning after MLB was notified that he had tested positive for COVID-19. He was quarantined in a doctor’s office off to the side, Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said.
 Turner later returned to the field with a mask to celebrate the Dodgers’ title. He then took down his mask and posed for a team photo on the field.
 "Immediately upon receiving notice from the laboratory of a positive test, protocols were triggered, leading to the removal of Justin Turner from last night’s game,” MLB said in a statement Wednesday. "Turner was placed into isolation for the safety of those around him. However, following the Dodgers’ victory, it is clear that Turner chose to disregard the agreed-upon joint protocols and the instructions he was given regarding the safety and protection of others.
 "While a desire to celebrate is understandable, Turner’s decision to leave isolation and enter the field was wrong and put everyone he came in contact with at risk. When MLB Security raised the matter of being on the field with Turner, he emphatically refused to comply.”
 Turner became a free agent when his $64 million, four-year contract expired following the victory.
 Turner’s agent, Greg Genske, did not immediately respond to a text from The Associated Press seeking comment.
 "Last night, nasal swabs were conducted on the Dodgers’ traveling party,” MLB said. "Both the Rays and Dodgers were tested again today and their travel back to their home cities will be determined after being approved by the appropriate authorities.”
 Both teams were traveling home from the Dallas area on Wednesday in coordination with their local health authorities, a person familiar with the arrangements said, speaking on condition of anonymity because no announcement was made.
 No additional players received positive results from rapid PCR tests early Wednesday, the person said, but the wife of one Rays player tested positive, the person said. The wife and the player did not travel with the team and were to travel on their own, the person said.
 A private plane was being arranged for Turner's travel, the person said.
 The commissioner’s office said it will consult with the players’ association as part of its investigation. The union was in the process of gathering facts on the events.
 Turner hit .307 with four homers and 23 RBIs in the pandemic-shortened season and .293 (17-for-58) with three homers and six RBIs in the postseason, including .320 with a pair of solo homers in the World Series.
 "Having a mask on and staying socially distanced, he wanted to come out and take a picture with the trophy, which can’t state strongly enough how big of a role he’s played in the success of this organization,” Friedman said.
 "But I think for him, just being a free agent, not knowing exactly how the future is going to play out, I don’t think there was anyone that was going to stop him from going out," he said. "I think from at least my perspective and not watching it super closely with everything going on, but I think he was mindful of other people, especially other people that he hadn’t already been in contact with. This is something that we’re going to wrap our arms around tonight and in the morning and figure out where we’re going from here.”
 Turner, however, was visible on the field without a mask during the celebration. And Dodgers manager Dave Roberts was nearby, also not wearing a mask.
 "I haven’t seen the pictures,” Friedman said. "If there are people around them without masks, that’s not good optics at all. I haven’t seen them, so it’s hard for me to speak to it specifically."
 "But I think from our standpoint, I think the people who were around him were people that would be in the contact tracing web, anyway, with just how closely a lot of us have been around each other,” he said. "And so now I think the subsequent tests we’re going to take are really important to figure out what we do and to make sure that any of us that are potentially positive do not spread it to other people.”
 Turner has served as a player representative on the union executive board and spoke about the protocols on Sept. 29, a day ahead of the Dodgers' postseason opener.
 "Obviously there’s a lot of protocols and things that we’re allowed to do and not allowed to do in getting tested every day, and I would say it’s been a pretty successful season getting to this point and getting to the playoffs,” he said then.
 "I was probably in that category where I was optimistic that we were going to have a season, but there was definitely some doubt whether or not it was going to happen. So to be sitting here today watching playoff baseball as the American League kind of kicks off their wild-card round, I would say that we did a good job and I commend everyone for taking it serious and being responsible and making good choices and allowing us to get to this point.”
 He addressed the success of reaching the World Series despite the pandemic on Oct. 19, a day before Game 1.
 "I think it’s ultimately a testament to the players for being responsible and making good choices and doing everything that we had to do to ensure that the season was able to go on,” he said. "So I tip my cap to every player who put the uniform on and took that risk of playing and was responsible about it and did it the right way and enabled us to have a full season and now be able to participate in a World Series.”

Oct 29 (Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho said Gareth Bale has worked hard to improve his fitness levels and will be ready to "fly" when he takes the field against Royal Antwerp in the Europa League later on Thursday.


  Bale had been nursing a knee injury since his return to Spurs last month on a season-loan loan from Real Madrid but has got up to speed in recent weeks.


  Mourinho confirmed Bale would start the Group J match and was confident the Wales international is ready to deliver.


  "Bale is playing and we all have not just a feeling but the data to show that Bale is arriving," Mourinho told reporters.


  "He's been quite a great example for everybody. A big guy like him travelled to Burnley, stayed on the bench for 90 minutes, didn't play one minute.


  "His behaviour as a team guy is incredible. We can see already Gareth at a good level and hopefully he can fly because he's working very hard." (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford )

Our technical teams have spent an enormous amount of time with our customers since the pandemic began, working with them to identify how do they optimize their profitability, how do they optimize their refinery margins in an environment where demand is changing dramatically, relative demand is changing, and the value of their products have been changing. And so this is what our teams do best. They are superb at working with our customers to identify strategies for maximizing our customer's profitability and then turning that into a catalyst formulation. And the vast majority of our customers are still pursuing that exact techno -- that exact strategy.

Freight cycles have tended the last 18 months. So I think that at the end of the day, we would expect capacity to remain pretty tight and the demand side of the equation is probably going to depend to some extent on the pandemic and our response and how the economy handles that.

The performance against a Buccaneers team that allows a league-low 3.0 yards per carry is explainable. The Raiders were without their entire starting offensive line all week after right tackle Trent Brown tested positive for the coronavirus and the other four starters were sent home because they had “high risk” contacts with Brown.


  They returned to the team just hours before the game but struggled to get into a rhythm after a lack of practice.


  “We had a lot of guys that didn’t practice the whole week. You could tell them like we weren’t all on the same page at the same time,” Jacobs said. “It was kind of slow getting to certain reads and certain things.”


  But the problems running the ball go deeper than just that one game. Jacobs has topped 4.0 yards per carry just once this season as the line has struggled to open up holes with Brown and left guard Richie Incognito missing most of the season, and Jacobs has been unable to break tackles as easily as he did as a rookie.

  “2020 has been a pretty big year … so I think all of those emotions are boxing up a bit more than previously.”


  Movember global director of mental health and suicide prevention Brendan Maher said it was important to find a release.


  “Many guys are isolated and disconnected from their usual social support networks,” he said.


  “And the places where men usually go to have those shoulder-to-shoulder conversations with their mates, like going out for a drink or a bite to eat, watching or play sport, or going to the gym, have been severely reduced.”


  Zenko Yoga Studio instructor Lauren Verona, who has supported Movember for the past seven years, said yoga was a good alternative.

  The yoga studio is offering a free month for new male members during November.


  Mr Bischoff is also hosting his second annual “Row for a Bro” kayaking event, encouraging locals to come along for a paddle, fish and a chat along the way.

With that date almost upon us, Microsoft is readying Edge (both the new and legacy versions) as well as Internet Explorer to ditch Flash once and for all. On December 31, Microsoft will begin applying this patch (or something like it) whether you’re ready or not. There’s one exception: Enterprises that depend on Adobe Flash for some legacy application will be allowed to run it via the Internet Explorer mode feature within Edge, but without Microsoft support.


  Microsoft does allow a little leeway in case you install the Flash-killing patch, then later change your mind. One solution involves creating a Windows restore point, then restoring your PC to a point before the patch was installed. Alternatively, users could reinstall the Windows operating system entirely, and choose not to install the update after doing so.


  Holding onto legacy Flash code so that you can access Flash archives of art and games like Newgrounds.com has become less important as time goes on, and as emulators have been developed.

The win came four days after Portville had been beaten, 2-1, at Randolph on Saturday.


  “It seemed like it was an even battle the rest of the first half, and both teams had chances, but both defenses did a good job stopping them,” said Portville coach Jesse Archer. “We had the ball at our feet a whole lot more in our second half and kept the ball in their half.”


  Portville (4-3) only allowed four shots in the game, and goalkeeper Faith Capito stopped each of them, earning a shutout.


  “(Capito) had several plays where she came way out of the box to clear the ball with her feet,” Archer said. “Those are critical plays, and we’ve been working on that quite a bit. She was quick and decisive tonight.”


  Archer complimented his defense’s ability to stop Randolph (5-3) counter attacks in the second half, especially the play of sophomore defender Leah Wyant.


  “She’s relatively small, but very fast,” Archer said. “Like so many other positions in soccer, when your positioning and anticipation is what it should be, you can compensate for not having tremendous size. Those are three things that she brings for us every game.”

India on Wednesday strongly deplored the personal attacks against French President Emmanuel Macron following his tough stance on radical Islam, calling it a violation of the most basic standards of international discourse.
 In a strongly-worded statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) also condemned the brutal terrorist attack that took the life of a French teacher in a gruesome manner and asserted that there is no justification for terrorism for any reason or under any circumstance.
 "We strongly deplore the personal attacks in unacceptable language on President Emmanuel Macron in violation of the most basic standards of international discourse," the MEA said.
 "We also condemn the brutal terrorist attack that took the life of a French teacher in a gruesome manner that has shocked the world. We offer our condolences to his family and the people of France," it said.
 Following the MEA statement, French Ambassador to India Emmanuel Lenain thanked India saying both countries can count on each other in the fight against terrorism.
 "Thank you @MEAIndia. France and India can always count on each other in the fight against terrorism," he tweeted.
 Macron has been facing criticism from various Muslim-majority countries after he took a tough stand on radical Islam and defended cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The French President said that Islam was a religion in "crisis".
 His comments came in the backdrop of the beheading of French teacher Samuel Paty on October 16 outside Paris in broad daylight. He had shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad to his students.

Yes. The mix, the Pega Cloud. Great. Yes. Sorry. So I don't -- I keep saying that the mix at 50% is something that we've seen more quarters than we haven't, as you know. But every once in a while, a quarter jumps up a little bit. I don't know if that's a trend or if that just happens to be an anomaly of a quarter. But I'll tell you, the feeling I have is that Pega Cloud has momentum, let me just say it that way, but the mix could stay at 50%. I just felt it's hard for me to guess. But I will say that I would be surprised if the percentage dropped well below 50% for a number of sequential quarters. I think that's not the way the business feels to me.

What does that mean? Gerald F. Kominski, director of UCLA’s Center for Health Policy Research, told journalist John Donovan that so-called “super-users” in two categories significantly drive up the overall cost of health care delivery.


  The first group comprises those who develop an acute illness like an emergency appendectomy or suffer an accident that requires hospitalization and acute care. Still, those illnesses or accidents are basically once-in-a- lifetime occurrences.


  But the second group – those with chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease – who need regular physician, hospital, and emergency room care, expensive medicines, and treatment – really consume health care expenses.


  Experts say systemic changes in health care management could stave off much of the ER, hospital care, and interventional treatments if those patients had better management of their treatments.


  The availability of health care in rural locales is a problem with which Mississippians are all too familiar. Poor people in places with Hill-Burton hospitals - where the percentages of either private pay or government- reimbursed care are severely impacted - put those facilities’ future at dire risk.


  Bottom line? The future is more patients scrambling for fewer resources in a health care system, not particularly equipped to handle the influx.


  Those are bipartisan challenges that will hit us all close to home. Social Security, Medicare, Hill-burton, Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, none of those fixes have fixed the American health care system. The next shift of government leaders – federal, state, and local - have one long row to hoe on this single issue

And I would expect -- that, as Michael said, I mean the mix of the COVID tailwinds can have some variability to it. The second quarter was really strong for a lot of the diagnostic testing, as we said. And Michael was referencing the different testing types. We had some benefit from the serological testing in the second quarter that contributed to the 500 to 600 basis points. As you look at the third quarter, I mean the serological piece of it fell off a bit just because of the mix in what the market is using. But by the same token, overall testing volumes have increased as we head into the fourth quarter. We saw some good order activity in the tail end of the third quarter. So, we expect that mix to kind of move back to a little bit more on the diagnostics side. The biopharma production piece of it has been really strong. So, it's hard to say what the exact precise tailwinds would be. But I would expect somewhere in the Q2 to Q3 kind of range somewhere in those dynamics.

  # Elon invites author to talk faith and white supremacy


  Dean-Paul Stephens


  Times-News


  Elon University brought students and religious scholar Robert P. Jones together Tuesday evening, Oct. 27, to talk racism and the modern church.


  "This has been with us from the founding of the country, and Christianity as the most dominant cultural power in the country has been the most powerful force in legitimizing this world view," Jones said, later adding, “It should be a scandal. The racial divide in the church should be a scandal.”


  Racism in the modern church is one of the primary topics in Jones' book "White Too Long," which explores the intersection of evangelical faith and white supremacy. During his digital talk, Jones says the topic is still fraught.


  "What happens if we look in the mirror, and instead of walking away, looking away or dismissing it, we hold the gaze?" Jones said, later adding that past scholars on the subject have said that it's important to listen to voices outside of one's own church.


  Jones remarked on the segregation of white and black churches, saying this segregation, which continues to this day, accounts for the stark difference in perception between white and black evangelicals. Drawing from data, Jones remarked that white evangelicals tend to support President Donald Trump, while Black evangelicals are largely in support of challenger Joe Biden.


  In an attempt to put forth practical solutions, Jones said that it’s important not to have discussions on race that exist only in the abstract.


  “We’re talking about something that has been built in over generations,” Jones said. “It’s going to take generations to really move it back the other way. It needs to be built out of the experience of churches.”


  A number of students who participated in the meeting by submitting questions said that was easier said than done. Each student asked Jones to touch on practical solutions to dealing with white supremacy both in and out of the church. Jones said establishing relationships is one of several practical methods.


  “There has to be a meeting of the minds,” Jones said while revisiting his point about different perspectives among black and white churches. “If you listen to an average white pastor for a year … and you listen to an average African American pastor for a year, they will highlight very different passages in the Bible.”


  Jones also took a moment at the end of the meeting to talk politics. Prompted by a student who wanted to know the likelihood of addressing these issues should Trump receive a second term, Jones said addressing white supremacy in Christianity is a difficult prospect as long as Trump is in office.


  “We have no groups farther apart on the election than black and white Christians,” Jones said “We have eight out of 10 white evangelicals saying they are going to support Trump, and nine out of 10 black evangelicals saying they are going to support Joe Biden, so you can’t get much more further apart than that. I think we ought to interrogate that. What does that mean? We worship the same God, read from the same Bible, and yet we end up at such drastically different places.”

"Plan B": wat moeten we doen als álle 2.000 bedden op intensieve zorg zijn ingenomen?


--DocBreak--
Going to Cambridge had always been a dream for Matthew Omoefe Offeh, one of a growing number of black students who are slowly reshaping the elite university's racial mix, helped in part by rapper Stormzy.


  The 18-year-old from Luton, north of London, has just started an engineering course at Cambridge's Magdalene College, which traces its roots to 1428 and whose illustrious alumni include the 17th-century diarist Samuel Pepys.


  Offeh has benefited from Target Oxbridge, a free coaching programme that looks to open up Oxford and Cambridge to more working-class and minority students.


  Oxford and Cambridge are the two oldest and most prestigious British universities, synonomous with educating the sons and daughters of the establishment from Britain and around the world.


  "Some people think that they won't fit in, that Cambridge isn't a place for black students," Offeh told AFP.


  "If you show your passion for your subject and your ability to do it, then you should be fine," he said.


  Offeh is among 137 black undergraduates who started at Cambridge this academic year -- a 50-percent increase on last year and a huge jump on 2015, when the number was a paltry 38.


  The increase has brought the proportion of black undergraduates in this year's intake to 4.6 percent. That compares to 3.3 percent of black people in the overall population, according to the last census in 2011.


  "That's the highest figure we have ever had," said Professor Graham Virgo, senior pro-vice chancellor at the university.


  "We've been working very hard to encourage more black students to apply... we have known that black students are under-represented in the university," he said.


  \- Breaking glass ceilings -


  UK universities have been criticised for a lack of diversity and opportunities for black and minority ethnic (BAME) students and staff.


  In June at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests, Britain's first BAME female cabinet minister Valerie Amos said there was "deep structural and systemic discrimination" in higher education.


  Cambridge postgraduate student Nia-Cerise Conteh has tweeted about her experiences of physical and verbal assaults.


  On a BBC documentary aired this month called "Being Black at Cambridge", she described being racially abused by a university staff member on a train.


  Depressed at a lacklustre response from the university, she had thought of dropping out, but said through tears: "I'm fighting for every other black person who I know, who needs to occupy these spaces.


  "Black people need to know that they need to get here so that we can pave the way for others. And we need to break that glass ceiling," Conteh said.


  Cambridge said it took all such incidents seriously, and urged any affected students to come forward.


  The university's intake has traditionally favoured pupils from wealthy private schools over inner-city state establishments.


  But it has tried to encourage those from less well-off backgrounds to apply with information campaigns, scholarships and outreach on social media.


  Grime music star Stormzy launched a scholarship in 2018 to support black students at Cambridge who cannot afford the annual tuition fees of about £9,000 (nearly $12,000 or 10,000 euros) and the living costs.


  Initially Stormzy proposed the scheme to Oxford, which he says turned him down. This year, he is offering two Cambridge scholarships worth £18,000 ($23,000 or 19,000 euros).


  "Clearly that's been really important for those students. But also, it's really raised the profile" of the university among potential applicants, Virgo said.


  \- 'Decolonise' libraries -


  Wanipa Ndhlovu is in her third year studying law at Trinity College, Prince Charles' alma mater and the grandest of all the university's constituent colleges.


  She said the growth in numbers of black students at Cambridge had been visible.


  "The change from my first and my second year was really, really substantial," the 20-year-old told AFP. Looking at younger year groups, she felt "it's much easier for them to integrate".


  Ndhlovu was born in Zambia and said she had experienced the same kind of "micro aggressions and ignorance" at Cambridge as growing up in York, northern England.


  She admitted to being overwhelmed by Cambridge's imposing buildings, and worried that she would not meet anyone who was like her.


  The killing by police of George Floyd in the United States, which sparked the wave of Black Lives Matter protests across the world, "brought to my attention again that there's so many people who, no matter what I do, no matter what I achieve, just won't see me as equal".


  Virgo said he has met many students who want university authorities to take action in light of the protests.


  That meant ensuring "their voice is heard in the classroom, what we study -- and we really are looking at our curriculum to make sure that black voices and black experience is reflected".


  The university's response also includes a programme to "decolonise" its vast central library, to try to diversify and widen its collections.

Along coastal Louisiana, there were reports of some trailers flipped over, a gas station destroyed, and downed power lines and trees.
 Zeta had top sustained winds of 110 mph (177 kph) as a Category 2 hurricane at landfall and is the 27th named storm of a historically busy Atlantic hurricane season -- with over a month left to go. It set a new record as the 11th named storm to make landfall in the continental U.S. in a single season, well beyond the nine storms that hit in 1916.
 Zeta weakened to a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph (144 kph) as it moved into southern Mississippi a few hours after landfall.
 As much as 5 feet of Gulf water surrounded a casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, and deputies in Harrison County, Mississippi, received multiple calls from people who had remained in mobile homes that were threatened by winds.
 In the small coastal town of Bay St. Louis in Mississippi, former mayor Les Fillingame said the storm was "very intense" when it blew through.
 "It was a noisy storm. It was a truly howling wind," he said, but said thankfully it was also fast-moving. "It was a lot of wind for several hours which is enough."
 Tropical storm warnings were issued as far away as southern Virginia, highly unusual for the region. Forecasters issued a string of tornado warnings for as far east as the Florida Panhandle.
 New Orleans was in the warning areas of six previous storms that veered east or west this season. This time, Zeta stayed on course. Officials had been worried about the loss of a power from a turbine that helps power the city's aging drainage infrastructure and whether that would leave the city vulnerable to flooding but Zeta's swift movement meant flooding wasn't an issue.
 On Tuesday, Zeta raked across Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, toppling trees and briefly cutting power to more than 300,000 people but causing no deaths.
 It then regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico along a path slightly to the east of those of Hurricane Laura, which was blamed for at least 27 deaths in Louisiana in August, and Hurricane Delta, which exacerbated Laura's damage in the same area weeks later.
 The deteriorating weather prompted early voting sites to close for hours in the western Florida Panhandle. One voter in Mississippi worried about how long felled trees and debris might block roads.
 "With the election I just kind of hope the city gets the roads clear by November 3rd so everybody can get out and vote," said Mackenzie Umanzor, of D'Iberville, Mississippi.
 An average season sees six hurricanes and 12 named storms. This extraordinarily busy season has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.
 And the fact that so many of the storms have been concentrated in such a small piece of Gulf Coast real estate has meant repeated damage for some places. On Dauphin Island, Alabama, Mayor Jeff Collier said residents and workers had nearly finished cleaning up from Hurricane Sally when the wind started blowing and the water started rising yet again.
 "This is going to put his back to square one again," Collier said.

Tito, thank you for that. The regulatory timetable is to implement it on November 3. So we’re very close to that. And in terms of how we are prepared, yes, I think it’s the pressure on the profitability there. But when we compare Cielo to other players, bear in mind that in comparison to the competition, we are underpenetrated. So other players may have a reduction on their current profitability, because they are so heavily already penetrated on the client base. Given that every new percentage points that we gain in penetration is new revenues for us and that we are focusing our attention to SMBs. This will be an increasing profitability. I see that as an opportunity for Cielo. Cielo has an appropriate cash position, appropriate liquidity, and an appropriate strategy to focus on receivables on SMBs.

Chase Elliott and Alex Bowman face identical odds (-25) at Martinsville but got there in considerably different ways.
 Elliott entered Texas just eight points back but was felled near the end of the second stage, when he was forced to come down pit road twice due to a tire that came apart during pit exit. Elliott had not taken tires on that stop and was running inside the top-10 with a chance to score stage points.
 The no tire decision was crew chief Alan Gustafson aggressively trying to score maximum points to make up the eight point deficit.
 "You see guys make aggressive strategy calls and get points," Elliott said. "We were just trying to do that and get an extra point or two, which I think was a good play. I just didn't realize the tire was coming apart."
 Elliott ultimately finished 20th and one lap down and likely needs to win at Martinsville to stave off once again coming just short of making the final four.
 "For us, we need to go win," Elliott said. "That's kind of the bottom line. I'm not even going to look at points because in my opinion it really doesn't matter.
 "If you can't win races and win them consistently in this series, you're not going to win the championship anyway. We're going to go there with that mindset, and put ourselves in position to do that, and hope things go our way."
 Meanwhile, Bowman has finishes of third and fifth in this round, but with only one win on the season, just didn't have the playoff points compared to some of his fellow contenders. Bowman has even score stage points in three of the four stages over the past two races.
 Bowman even overcame a slow pit stop to post his latest top-five.

 "I view it like we should have run better all year and accumulates more playoff points," Bowman said. "We've run third and fifth the past two weeks and either lost points or stayed about the same. It comes down to needing more playoff points throughout the year.
 "Last week, we were in position to win, this week different circumstances, but we were capable of winning."
 But now he's going to have to win at Martinsville, a track that has not been kind to him, to the tune of a 22.0 average finish in nine starts with just two top-10s.
 "Martinsville has been very hit or miss for me," Bowman said. "I feel like we need to go there and win. Obviously, some guys could have some bad days, but we need to go win. That's a place where I feel like I have some things to learn, and our short track program is still a little short.
 "We just needed to run better throughout the year. We've done a phenomenal job these past two months, but over the summer, when we needed to be accumulating playoff points, we were struggling."

By attacking U.S. companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, the Justice Department, members of Congress, and some state attorneys general have taken a step back in time and are forgetting the hard work that has been done on the issue of antitrust. Companies being too large or successful is not a violation of antitrust laws. Antitrust was established to focus on the consumer and there is a robust consumer welfare standard in our antitrust laws now.


  Plus, many of the technology companies that are currently being attacked provide free services to our families, services that we use every day in our lives. Comments have been made about political bias within our technology companies from both sides of the aisle. There are solutions to political bias, but mistakenly using antitrust is not the right way to encourage free speech.


  Politicizing antitrust by attacking our technology companies and filing federal and state antitrust lawsuits are not the way to go for our country’s future. Lawsuits are a distraction from real issues that need to be addressed and a waste of taxpayers’ money. Solutions are out there; decision makers and our technology companies can find them together. Lawsuits will only cause delay, distraction and economic losses. Our technology jobs and our future are at stake.

With the rising popularity of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, many patients prefer OTC drugs over obtaining a prescription from a healthcare professional. Numerous common and harmless fungal infections are left untreated by patients, owing to medical costs and logistical constraints. These have directly contributed to the rise in the usage of OTC drugs, as these infections can be treated by OTC drugs, owing to their ease of availability. According to the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, more than 81% of adults use OTC medicines as their first response to minor ailments. The increased usage of OTC drugs has further contributed to the rise in anti-fungal drug sales over the years. Many OTC anti-fungal creams, ointments, and tablets are available worldwide. With many drugs still in the pipeline, OTC drugs are estimated to conquer the existing anti-fungal drugs market over the forecast period. The anti-fungal drugs market is expected to grow at a steady pace owing to the rising research and development activities. When a harmful fungal infection is detected in a patient, OTC drugs are sometimes used to minimize the fungal effect, until consulted by a doctor. Considering all the factors, OTC drugs play a crucial role in driving the growth of the global anti-fungal drugs market.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The flood of obituaries for Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-Hee since his death over the weekend have mostly shared his most defining quote: “Change everything except for your wife and children.”
 Lee’s rant against what he saw as complacency during a senior management meeting in 1993 reflects the demanding leadership that helped the company grow from an obscure maker of cheap televisions into a technology giant.
 Questions loom over what's next as Samsung, South Korea's largest company by far, begins an era led by Lee’s son and corporate heir, Lee Jae-yong.
 The younger Lee has been calling the shots since his father suffered a heart attack in 2014. He now faces immense pressure to navigate Samsung's transition beyond its core hardware business into increasingly diverse technologies and services.
 At the same time, Lee faces the distraction of a prolonged court battle over his indictment on charges of financial crimes related to a massive corruption scandal. He also needs to raise cash to pay astronomical inheritance taxes to cement his control over the business empire left by his father.
 At least financially, Samsung appears to be in great shape.
 The company said Thursday its operating profit for the last quarter reached a two-year high of 12.35 trillion won ($10.89 billion), a 59% jump from a year earlier, thanks to strong sales of computer memory chips, smartphones and appliances.

BOSTON -- Gov. Charlie Baker and his top education advisors urged schools Tuesday not to overreact to the rise in COVID-19 cases this fall, telling even those districts in communities deemed to be at the highest risk for transmission of the virus to stick with in-person learning unless there is evidence of spread within the school system.
 Education Secretary Jim Peyser and Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Jeff Riley also defended plans for the state to administer the MCAS exam in the spring, describing the test as being linked to federal funding and necessary to measure how far students may have fallen behind.
 The recommendations from Baker and his senior education team came after three straight days of the state reporting more than 1,000 new cases of COVID-19, a mark not seen since May. The administration, however, continued to assert that schools have not been linked to increased transmission.
 "We are not seeing the spread take place, the clustering take place, in the schools as was initially feared," Riley said. Last week, education officials reported 202 cases of COVID-19 detected in schools.
 Boston last week switched to full remote learning, and after three weeks in the high-risk category Abington Public Schools said Monday it would shift to remote-only learning until at least Nov. 12. In Milton, the high school will pivot to fully-remote learning starting Tuesday after the rise in infections left it understaffed.
 Baker said he wouldn't "Monday morning quarterback" any district's decision, but suggested school might be a safer place for teenagers than at home.
 "It's a jump ball in my mind about whether having all those kids at home fraternizing with their friends, not wearing a mask, not socially distancing on the off-hours, is probably every bit as risky, maybe more so based on what's going on in the parochial schools, than those kids being at schools, wearing a mask and having the rhythm and the structure that comes with spending six or seven hours a day in a formal setting where everybody's got a face covering on," Baker said.
 The governor said he understood, for instance, why Marblehead went remote for two weeks after it could not identify all the attendees of a large party. He then pointed out the decision his hometown of Swampscott made to switch to a hybrid model after being in the high-risk red category for multiple weeks.
 "If you don't have any transmission in your schools, it's probably fine to continue to have kids go to school," the governor said.
 Peyser and Riley testified before the Joint Committee on Education on Tuesday as part of a legislative oversight hearing on the state's return to school in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The governor's comments were made later in the day during a press conference where he backed up the message from his advisors.
 The Baker administration has asked districts to review at least three weeks of community COVID-19 data before considering changes to their learning models, but Peyser said even consistently "red" communities should not switch to remote learning unless the virus is spreading in schools.
 "It is increasingly clear that schools are not a source of transmission," Peyser said.
 Billerica School Superintendent Tim Piwowar said that in his town, where they adopted a hybrid learning model, there have been 15 cases of COVID-19 in the school community. While he said Billerica will likely soon be in the "red" category, the schools have detected no evidence of transmission and only five close contacts within the classroom setting.
 Piwowar said the biggest impediments in Billerica to bringing all students back to the classroom was physical space to accommodate six feet of distancing and transportation.
 "We simply do not have the financial wherewithal to double our transportation costs to facilitate a full in-person return," Piwowar said.
 Riley said DESE was reviewing whether it could safely loosen the guidelines for school transportation and distancing on buses, particularly for rural school districts where students must travel longer distances to get to schools.
 "That is still in development and no decision has been made on that and it has to be blessed by medical professionals," Riley said.
 Sen. Jason Lewis, the co-chair of the committee, acknowledged competing desires among educators, advocates and parents for the state to either provide clearer guidance on how schools should act, or to leave those decisions more fully to local communities.
 "There are no easy answers," Lewis said. "What I'm sure we can all agree upon is we must do everything we can to support the academic and social-emotional needs of all our students."
 Piwowar said that while he could support an MCAS exam this spring to be used as a diagnostic tool, he said it should be "loudly, clearly and repeatedly" stated that the test will not be used to hold teachers accountable or to compare districts.
 Massachusetts Association of School Committees Executive Director Glenn Koocher also said he was leery of how the test data might be used. And while he credited Riley with trying to heal the relationship between DESE and local school officials, he said a "detente" is probably the best that could be achieved.
 "To those who will threaten districts, I would simply say, when you threaten us, you demonize yourself," Koocher said, taking issue with DESE's plans to audit districts that remain remote despite low virus activity.
 Peyser said the MCAS would be important this school year for the state to understand how much learning students lost by being home for many months, or trying to learn remotely. While he predicted an increase in pressure to suspend the exam for another year, he called that a "stalking horse" for ending standardized testing completely.
 Riley said the department also has no reason to believe that the federal government will relax testing requirements in 2021, which is linked to substantial amounts of federal education aid.
 "We do need, at a bare minimum, diagnostic statewide data and I think parents want to know if their kids have lost ground and how much," Riley said.
 The hearing took place at the same time Baker and Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders were warning that celebrations of Thanksgiving with extended family this year would be extremely risky.
 Sen. Julian Cyr, of Truro, asked, through the chairman of the committee, whether districts or the state should consider a mandatory week of remote learning after the holiday to mitigate the threat of students bringing COVID-19 into the schools from holiday travel or festivities.
 Peyser responded that the state was focused on maximizing safe time in the classroom, and Riley said that although it had been discussed, it was not the department's recommendation.
 "We think, at this time, that is not the way to go," Riley said.
 The emphasis on making sure as many students are able to return to the classroom as possible comes as the Trump administration is preparing to send more than 2 million rapid COVID-19 antigen tests to Massachusetts that will be deployed to an initial group of schools in early November.
 Riley said the pilot program using Abbott BinaxNOW tests, which can diagnose coronavirus infection in as little as 15 minutes, will be a critical new tool for schools to identify infection in symptomatic students and staff and contain the virus before it starts spreading.
 Riley hinted that in the coming weeks the administration also would have a major announcement to make on internet connectivity and hotspots for students.
 Hadley School Superintendent Anne McKenzie said internet connectivity continues to be an issue in western Massachusetts, where even some principals didn't have home internet at the start of the pandemic.
 "This issue of connectivity in western Massachusetts cannot be overstated," McKenzie said.
 Thomas Scott, the executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, said one of his biggest concerns was burnout of administrators and teachers, which was repeated by a number of administrators about the pressure and long hours teachers are dealing with.
 "We're still learning as we go but it's clear to us we have to be cognizant of the demands we're making on people right now," Scott said.
