This article accompanies SPECIAL REPORT-Challenging police violence...while Black USA-POLICE/IMMUNITY-RACE)
 By Andrea Januta, Jaimi Dowdell, Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung
 Dec 23 (Reuters) - Qualified immunity, entwined with the U.S. history of racism and the struggle against it, emerged during the civil rights movement.
 Throughout 1961, groups of activists known as Freedom Riders challenged segregation in interstate public transit stations in the South. The Supreme Court had outlawed such segregation in a ruling the previous year, but local police still arrested hundreds of protesters who descended on the South to enter "whites only" or "colored only" areas of bus and train stations.
 With that backdrop, the Rev. Robert L. Pierson, a white Episcopal priest, and 14 other priests, both Black and white, knew they were risking arrest or worse when they boarded a bus on Sept. 12, 1961, on what they called a "Prayer Pilgrimage." In less than 48 hours, when the group entered a "whites only" area of a bus terminal in Jackson, Mississippi, for lunch, all 15 were arrested and jailed for breach of peace.
 A local judge sentenced the priests to the maximum four months in jail, plus a $200 fine each. The charges were dismissed on appeal. The priests then turned around and sued the police under Section 1983 of the Ku Klux Klan Act for violating their civil rights through unlawful arrest. The act is one of three laws passed in the early 1870s to protect Black people from civil rights violations.
 After a jury decided against the priests, they appealed to the New Orleans- based 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. That court identified errors in the trial and ordered that a new one be held. The 5th Circuit also ruled that the police were not immune from the federal lawsuit, a conclusion that the officers appealed to the Supreme Court.
 By then, Chief Justice Earl Warren's high court had handed down many landmark decisions that expanded the civil rights of Black Americans, including Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down segregation in schools in 1954.
 But on April 11, 1967, the justices dealt a blow to Pierson and other plaintiffs who would file similar civil lawsuits in the decades to come. Warren wrote in his opinion that, while police are not entitled to "absolute and unqualified immunity," officers should not be held liable "if they acted in good faith and with probable cause in making an arrest under a statute that they believed to be valid."
 The officers had argued that they believed arresting the priests for breach of peace was justifiable because the aim was to prevent violence. If this were the case, the Supreme Court ruled, the officers deserved immunity. The priests had argued that the officers' intent was not to prevent violence, but to enforce segregation, in violation of the priests' constitutional rights.
 Warren's idea that officers acting in "good faith" should not be held accountable for federal civil rights violations laid the groundwork for today's interpretation of qualified immunity for police. The concept evolved as the courts worked to develop an objective test for whether an officer acted reasonably. Today, even if officers are found to have violated a person's rights, judges must grant immunity if they find no clear precedent putting officers on notice that their actions were out of line.
 The Pierson ruling was a departure from the Warren Court's progressive rulings on civil rights. Just months later, the court found that laws banning interracial marriage were illegal in Loving v. Virginia.
 "It is a fascinating part of the story that even the court considered the most protective of Black people would introduce this doctrine," Scott Michelman, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, D.C., said. "That says to me something very powerful about the institutional culture not just of the police but of courts, the exalted place that police have held in the national consciousness."

They will likely turn to some kind of committee led by Wilson, with Tevin Coleman and Jerick McKinnon sprinkled in.

Equally enjoyable, if sadly only available in Dutch, is the biography of R.P. Cleveringa, written by leading Dutch legal sociologist Kees Schuyt after his formal retirement. Cleveringa was a professor of law at Leiden who became famous when opening the academic year in 1940 with a speech suggesting university staff should resist Nazification and stand behind the Jewish colleagues whose work was made impossible. These included the doyen of Dutch private law, E.M. Meijers, and the young Ben Telders (he of the moot court competition). Cleveringa, not Jewish, could have gone with the flow; it took considerable courage to speak up but, much to his credit, he never saw it as courageous – for a man of character, this was simply the thing to do. Schuyt’s biography traces Cleveringa’s upbringing, paints a wonderful portrait of the Netherlands under German occupation as well as of student and academic life in student-town Leiden, and demonstrates what grace under pressure looks like.

Scott Lindsay — a former public safety adviser to Mayor Ed Murray and architect of the erstwhile Navigation Team of social workers and police officers that cleared homeless encampments — encourages the return to the carrot and stick approach: the threat of incarceration in order to induce people into treatment, job training, and other services.

In August 2020, the plenary of the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court delivered a decision affirming the legal capacity of an indigenous _movement_ , the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB), to bring a claim before the Supreme Court for the review of actions and omissions of the federal government and the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) when addressing the threat of Covid-19 to indigenous peoples – and ordering both the government and FUNAI to take precise actions for the protection of the indigenous peoples against such threat. The Decision is grounded on the Brazilian Federal Constitution and on international treaties which Brazil has ratified and introduced into its domestic legal system. At different moments, as we explain below, the Decision interprets this corpus of domestic law in light of international law. Notably, the Decision draws on the latter to affirm the need to ensure intercultural dialogue in enforcing the right to health. In this post, we begin with an account of the social-legal context of the Decision, before looking at how it addresses the right to access to justice and right to health before offering some final thoughts.

_Lear_ helps me see, feel, and measure life differently. For more than 40 years, I have found in _Lear_ the vulnerable pulse and impulse of being human. The play condenses and dramatizes a tale of unraveling. The story is at once intimate and public—about the forms of self-destruction lurking inside a king’s power, and about the distorted pettiness that can undo life.
 It’s about leadership exercised through the barrenness of lies, conniving, secrets, and charades. It’s a story of power and its impotence. The king cannot save himself, nor can the people around him. No one needs to strain to feel the heartbeat and the heartache of this drama. It may not be our tale, but it is our story.
  _Lear_ certainly makes for a different kind of Christmas reading. As the play unfolds, I can be choked by its jarring tragedy, the needless anguish of the tumbling, destructive descent toward death.
 At the same time, I can see and feel it with some measure of dispassion because I know that this is precisely not my king, not my family, not my nation. And yet it is. My soul trembles as _King Lear_ names and exposes the human greediness for love, combustibly combined with the treacherousness of our self-interest. It all hits rather too close to home, speaking not just to Shakespeare’s time but to ours, speaking not just to Lear’s struggles but to our own.

Nous avons donc concocté tout un programme et c’est une première ! Proposer des animations 2.0 pour un château, cela peut surprendre. Nous sommes d’ailleurs les seuls en Lorraine à le faire. Et très peu en France. Beaucoup de châteaux pensaient accueillir à nouveau des visiteurs à partir du 15 décembre. Et n’avaient pas imaginer de plan B pour la période. Ce qui est totalement compréhensible. Nous avions quelque peu anticipé la période en nous préparant quoiqu’il arrive pour communiquer et proposer cette animation 2.0. L’année a été particulière. Avec des difficultés à recevoir les visiteurs. Pour nous, pour les fêtes de fin d’année, le spectacle devait se passer sur les réseaux sociaux du Château de Fléville._ »

Bør avlyse viss ein vaknar med symptom
 Høie er klar på at kvar enkelt må ta ansvar for å hindre at koronasmitten spreier seg under julefeiringa.
 – Mange er smitta og veit det ikkje sjølv. Mange vil vakne julaftan med symptom. Då er det viktig å ikkje gå i juleselskap, eller at ein avlyser selskapet viss ein bur der det skal vere, seier han.
 – Vi ser at smitten har spreidd seg i rekordfart i mange europeiske land, og at mange må stengje ned samfunnet for å få kontroll. Vi må forhindre at det same blir nødvendig i Noreg. Det gjer vi ved å feire jul på ein måte som ikkje spreier viruset. Ikkje ver ein som spreier smitten. Ver ein som stoppar han, seier Høie.
 Helseministeren er òg klar på at personar som bur saman med andre med symptom bør halde seg heime.

Speaking of those after whom moot courts are named, re-reading Philip Jessup’s _Transnational Law_ was eye-opening. It is often held, somewhat intuitively, that his pioneering book is mostly about how to come to terms with rules that are made either by actors other than states or in the form of instruments that do not neatly fit the traditional sources catalogue, but on closer scrutiny there is a second major concern lurking just underneath the surface. Jessup realized that calling something ‘law’ is by itself insufficient if not accompanied by ways of applying it. Hence, the concern for law-making is accompanied by a concern with the effect of rules in legal orders, knowing all too well that the traditional monism/dualism dichotomy is only of limited value when it comes to explaining the legal effects of, e.g., a contract between an electrician and the UN for repair work at UN headquarters. Calling such a contract ‘law’ is not all that meaningful unless there is also a legal order in which it can be applied.

I'm not sure whether the series is a slow burner -where each episode becomes better and funnier, or whether it's just not that funny.
 Perhaps the episodes in the revival series are funnier and more modern?
 One thing in particular I noticed was the overwhelmingly loud laugher placed over the punchlines of all of the "jokes" \- you couldn't even hear the last half of the jokes.
 In the first episode, Pauline Quirke's character, Tracey lives in a downbeat council flat with her criminal, and somewhat annoying husband. In contrast, her sister, Linda Robson's character lives the high-life in a luxury house with a pool.
 Both of their husbands are sent to prison for armed robbery, so the sisters are forced to live together, next to a Chigwell socialite - Lesley Joseph's character, Dorien.
 Although I didn't find it funny, it was still nice to see three female leads in a comedy programme in the late 80s, in a genre typically dominated by men in the era.
 With the comedy having a Christmas special this year, airing on Christmas Eve, I can only hope something decent will be on another channel.

Compliance should not and cannot rely upon coercion. Had the government been wiser in setting rules, and more effective in communicating the regulations and advice and the reasons for them, it would not now be in the absurd position of sending police to urge people not to board trains home. Over this year, goodwill has not only been drained by the cumulative effect of lockdown, but squandered by official incompetence, the flouting of lockdown by Dominic Cummings and the discovery that while millions are struggling economically, the chumocracy has prospered from government handouts dished out with little scrutiny. That the bulk of the public still wants to do the right thing is despite, not because, of the government.
