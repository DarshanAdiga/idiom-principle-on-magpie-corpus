Entering last season, Indians starting pitcher Shane Bieber knew he had the slider and the curveball. But he needed to bolster his repertoire to reach the next level.
   
 Part of it had to do with his fastball, but he still lacked an extra off-speed weapon against left-handed hitters to complement his other pitches. That was the key. And that need led to a winter's worth of work on his change-up, which in turn resulted in a breakout 2019 season.
   
 Much of the goal had to do with Bieber being able to throw his change-up in more counts. In 2018, he threw only 69 change-ups, and the pitch was hit hard to the tune of an opposing average of .357 and an opposing slugging percentage of .643. It was a poor attempt to keep lefties from reaching over the plate, and it rarely worked.
   
 The change-up was much improved in 2019, but it still didn't quite end up where he had hoped. Bieber threw his change-up 234 times in 2019 (206 to lefties). Opposing hitters had an average of .309 off of it with a .506 slugging percentage and a .324 wOBA -- all three represented the worst totals among his four pitches.
   
 The point wasn't to make the change-up a put-away pitch like his curveball and slider. He just needed something to keep hitters honest. But the change-up still needed work, and Bieber has again spent the winter refining it in an effort to make it a more consistent pitch.
   
 "With the change-up, I've been working on that for two offseasons in a row," Bieber said. "Last year I didn't have it at times. I'm trying to develop consistency and some more feel with it, which was kind of the goal for this offseason."
   
 Bieber's curveball and slider lifted him into the ace conversation in 2019. In two-strike counts, Bieber made the list of the top 20 put-away pitches -- twice. His slider had the fifth-best CSW rate (called strikes plus whiffs, which was created by Nick Pollack in 2018) in baseball, and his curveball was 17th. Only Gerrit Cole's fastball, Noah Syndergaard's slider, Max Scherzer's slider and Luis Castillo's change-up had better CSW rates than Bieber's slider. And Cole was the only other pitcher aside from Bieber to make the list twice.
   
 Enter the need to refine the change-up, which is meant to help keep hitters off those two pitches, only adding to their effectiveness. At least, that's the goal.
   
 "Yeah, that's the plan," Bieber said. "I haven't been able to use it the way I've liked to use it. Hopefully going into this year, that'll be the case. I think I can keep guys off the breaking stuff going away towards my glove side and that's when I need something going arm side so guys don't lean out over the plate."

It was a beautiful Read Across America day in the Daniel Webster School neighborhood this year as the school turned to an American icon to help it celebrate the annual tradition: Mister Rogers.
 Students and staff were decked out in the legendary star's trademark tie and cardigan for the kickoff assembly on Friday, Feb. 28.
 The focus on Mister Rogers began on World Read Aloud day earlier in the month, for which the DWS parent teacher organization purchased age-appropriate biographies of Rogers for each classroom, along with books of his poetry and collections of his "words of wisdom."
 "We started with his books, but we wanted to choose an American icon figure that really represents what we like to see our students emulate," DWS Reading Specialist Marilyn McBride said.
 Throughout the day students participated in a reading and writing marathon (with pledges benefiting the PTO), read stories with guest readers and, instead of a traditional story walk, went on a quote walk, set up by librarian Carly Walsh, moving as a group through eight of Rogers' quotes, reading them aloud and discussing their meaning.
 DWS staff incorporated writing into their Read Across America day festivities this year, including an all-school write, which asked students to reflect on things they like about themselves, inspired by Mr. Rogers' famous quote "I like you just the way you are."
 Writing was utilized on a classroom level as well.
 "So many of his messages are about kindness, so some of the classrooms are working on ways they can be kind to one another and writing those out," McBride said.
 Additionally, fourth- and fifth-grade classes read a number of quotes from Mr. Rogers and wrote essays on how those quotes speak to them. Two fifth-grade students, Jack Spignesi and Anna McNealy, read their essays to the school during Friday's kickoff assembly.
 "He helped his entire life and everybody loved him, no questions asked," Spignesi said. " When you help, it doesn't have to be big, just a simple act will do. It may be saying hello to someone, or giving someone a high five. You don't have to do it alone, maybe have a group of people do something kind for someone, or have one person surprise a bunch of people."
 In her essay, McNealy told students about the importance of recognizing your emotions and shared with them what she likes to do when she can tell she is angry or upset.
 McBride said students who didn't grow up with Mr. Rogers, like the staff did, are new fans.
 "We felt like he was somebody that we could teach some of our students his lessons," she said. "They've really responded well to him. Many staff have mentioned that the kids, after watching him, they've been very peaceful and calm."
 Putting together the day, McBride said, took a village.
 "It has truly been a team effort," she said. "Every staff member, every specialist, even our secretary, everyone helped with organizing it. Everything that's happening today has been a true team effort here at Daniel Webster School."
 These types of days, she said, help to bring the school community together.
 "With the staff's enthusiastic planning and participation, it reminds our students how much we value reading," she said. "With the Mister Rogers theme this year, it sends the message to each student how important they are as well."

A decade ago I was renting a tiny room in a small flat in north London. I had moved to the capital to study for a Master’s degree and I was living with strangers, while working two part-time jobs to bring in some money.
 For one of my jobs, I worked in a pub down the road. The work was fine - waitressing and pulling pints - but the hours were long. The manager would frequently harass the female staff with inappropriate comments and groping, but there was nobody to complain to. Over time, I became increasingly anxious and reduced my hours, finding extra work in a nearby independent bookshop.
 A couple of days a week, I would categorise old books and add them to an online system, as well as minding the shop when the owner - a kind if eccentric man - was out. The shop was a mess. In each room, piles of books rose from floor to ceiling, which made moving around a challenge. Layers of years-old dust coated everything. In so many ways, it was perfect.
 The hours passed quickly and quietly, and the stress of my studies and my other job began to dissipate. From time to time, the owner would dig out books relevant to my literature course and give them to me to read at lunchtime in the shop’s back garden, with the neighbour’s cat beside me. When I felt anxious, I would delve into fiction books and disappear into different worlds, far from my own.
 Working in the bookshop made a huge, positive difference to my mental health at a time when I felt overwhelmed. Between doing busy shifts at the pub and my studies, I was able to spend a few quiet hours a week reading, organising books and interacting with browsing customers, after which I felt calmer and far more able to cope with other stresses. For me, it made a world of difference - but these opportunities are under threat.
 Booksellers in the UK and the US have reported an upturn in sales and visitors this year, but not all independent bookshops are surviving the rise of Amazon. Last year, several iconic independent bookshops in the UK closed, including Shropshire’s Wenlock Books and Camden Lock Books in north London. In December, Holt Books – once named one of Britain’s top 50 bookshops - announced it would not be renewing its licence this year, blaming escalating rental costs and competition from internet shopping.
 The decline of the high street is nothing new, but in the face of a growing mental health crisis, recognising the positive impact that reading can have on mental health – and therefore bookshops and libraries - is crucial.
 So why is a good read good for us at a much deeper level?
 There’s something very special about being in a bookshop. Unlike other shops, they and libraries are calmer spaces where anyone can lose themselves in a story. And while you can browse millions of books online, there’s something irreplaceable about going into a shop and asking a book lover to guide us on the journey.
 It may be less convenient, but it’s much more mindful and restorative to search through a bookshop to find what you’re looking for - or locate an unexpected gem. As author and mental health advocate Matt Haig wrote on twitter: “Aren't bookshops wonderfully strange, sitting there with quiet menace, as if they were just a shop and not an entry point to 30,000 different universes?”
 In fact there’s a wealth of evidence to support the idea that books can help to boost good mental health. ‘Bibliotherapy,’ a term first coined by American essayist Samuel Crothers in a 1916 issue of Atlantic Monthly, means the art of using literature and reading as a healing activity. It’s widely accepted as a way to enhance wellbeing.
 In 2013, a study published in the journal Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy examined the impact of reading on 96 patients with mild depression. Those given a book to read saw an improvement in their symptoms. Another study by the University of Sussex found that reading can reduce stress by up to 68% - and is far more effective than other relaxing activities including listening to music or going for a walk (though don’t let that put you off…).
 Another study from The New School for Social Research in New York found that reading fiction improves something called ‘Theory of Mind’ - essentially, our ability to empathise with others and understand that other people hold different beliefs and desires to our own. Given the challenges we face and the depth of polarisation in society over politics, opening our minds to other thoughts, views and cultures is important. This has a direct and positive impact on our collective mental health too.
 Katerina Georgiou, a counsellor and psychotherapist, says there are many reasons why books can help improve your wellbeing, but one of the most important may be due to being “fully immersed in the here and now.”
 “Fiction in particular focuses you on an altogether different narrative to the one you may habitually have in your day to day life,” she told me in recent interview. “A fictional story typically follows a clear story arc of triumph over adversity, the overcoming of obstacles and an end resolution where balance is restored. This can tap into universal truths which give a reader a sense of meaning, connectedness, familiarity and hope.”
 Characters can also become role models or offer greater insight and empathy, putting us in touch with complex feelings that are sometimes difficult to articulate alone. “Seeing one's own complexities given voice on a page can be a healing experience in the recognition that something seemingly so personal to you is shared,” Georgiou explains.
 We often read literature for the feelings we hope to get from it - which might mean an experience of aliveness, love or fear followed by relief. “In this way we can feel feelings we might not often otherwise experience, depending on the way life currently is,” says John-Paul Davis, spokesperson for the UK Council for Psychotherapists. “For someone with depression or anxiety, for example, the feeling of love may not be as much a part of life as they’d like, but they can feel it at the turn of a page in a book.”
 For so many of us, loneliness and isolation are byproducts of mental health issues, but reading can help. “When we’re in emotional distress, we can also feel that others somehow seem to be better at life than us and that we’re alone in our experience,” Davis adds.
 “Through reading, we see that all humans, throughout time, have had similar needs and wants and struggle in similar ways to meet them. This shared experience helps us feel much more part of this wider interconnected body of humanity, which is great for our mental health and wellbeing.”
 Bookshops and libraries also give us access to a world of human knowledge and experience, showing us new ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. Non-fiction books exist on all subjects from resume writing to gardening and mindfulness, expanding a while range of opportunities for people to educate themselves and improve their understanding of the world – and their capacities to act in it effectively.
 Amazon and other online retailers will continue to slash book prices in the hope that consumers will prize cost and convenience over everything else. But slashing prices will never replace the joy of finding a second-hand novel filled with annotations from its previous owner, who needed the book just as much as you.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- There is a strong crop of drivers headed into free agency this summer and Alex Bowman has hardly been at the top of the list.  
 Brad Keselowski is a former Cup Series champion, Kyle Larson is considered the future of NASCAR and Ryan Blaney is poised for a breakout season. Erik Jones is determined not to be the lowest-performing driver at Joe Gibbs Racing, while Corey LaJoie is among a handful of young drivers desperate for a chance to drive competitive cars.  
 Bowman used to be in LaJoie's situation, a group of second- and third-tier drivers routinely passed over by the top teams. They settle for underfunded teams, often have to bring their own sponsorship, don't make much of a salary and never have a fair shot to win each week.  
 "Every year is a contract year. Every year of my life in the Cup Series has been a contract year," Bowman said. "I've had contracts and two weeks before Daytona read a tweet that said I'm not going to Daytona."  
 His break came in 2016 when the 22-year-old took his first big step away from driving bad race cars. Bowman patched together nine Xfinity Series races with Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s team and was available when Earnhardt was sidelined for a long portion of that season with lingering effects from multiple concussions. Hendrick Motorsports called Bowman for 10 of those races and he grabbed the first pole of his career and notched three top-10 finishes as a substitute.  
 Bowman again refused slow cars all of 2017. He ran just three times all year -- one Truck Series race, twice in the Xfinity Series and nothing at all in Cup -- and practiced his craft on simulators while waiting to be considered for a seat in a car that can actually win.  
 His plan worked to perfection when Earnhardt retired after the 2017 season and Rick Hendrick gave Bowman the No. 88 Chevrolet.  
 But going into the final year of a three-year contract, Bowman understood it was going to be a struggle to keep that seat considering how many drivers will be available at the end of the season. Hendrick already needs a driver to replace seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson when he steps back from a full schedule.  
 So Bowman opened the year determined not to lose the No. 88.  
 He qualified second for the Daytona 500, might have had a chance to win last week at Las Vegas if not for a late caution and then finally made his way to victory lane Sunday in California with a dominating run. It was Bowman's second career Cup victory in 156 starts, both in the Hendrick Chevrolet, and first opportunity to convince his boss he wants to keep his seat.  
 "Hendrick Motorsports is where I want to be. It's where I want to stay for the rest of my career," Bowman said. "There's a lot of outside pressure. There's a lot of pressure from myself. I just want to win races. That's all there is to it. When I come here and don't run well and people think I look mad or upset or I'm not friendly, you're dang right, I want to win races. I don't like running bad."  
 The victory locked Bowman into the 16-driver playoff field just three weeks into the season. He is the first Hendrick driver to win this year and the first to win in the new Chevrolet Camaro. The car struggled through two seasons after its introduction and Chevrolet was shut out of the championship finale both years. NASCAR allowed the manufacturer to make changes prior to this season and Bowman led three Camaros in the top four at California.  
 "When Chevrolet said they're going to commit to working hard to try to improve the body, that put a sense of morale throughout the whole shop, throughout the whole team, a lot of positive attitudes toward it," said crew chief Greg Ives. "We need to take that positive momentum of the hard work Chevy put in and we needed to put that to results on the racetrack, whether it was top 10, top 5's."  
 Running well early in the season is the boost Ives needs for his driver and crew. The struggle with the Camaro since 2017, plus the retirements of Jeff Gordon and Earnhardt, knocked Hendrick Motorsports down a peg. While Joe Gibbs Racing won a record 19 races last season and the title, Hendrick drivers won just four races and three were by Chase Elliott.  
 "It's great to have the win, but continuously building that momentum is something that is needed in the shop environment," Ives said. "It's needed when the guys turn on the TV and they see the racing we had and their product was on the racetrack competing. It's a totally different vibe, totally different feeling."  
 Does the early season win give Bowman any leverage in contract talks with Hendrick?  
 Ives answered for him: "No, he's going to need multiple wins, so we're going to work on that."  
 Bowman laughed at his crew chief, then admitted there is more work to be done the next 33 weeks.  
 "I'm as motivated as ever, doing everything I can to try to be the best on and off the racetrack as I can be," he said. "Hopefully we can make that happen. It is a contract year, but honestly every year of my career has been a contract year, so it's not much different."

BOCA RATON, Fla. — Ken Holland doesn't have a vote.
 And if he did, the general manager of the Edmonton Oilers wouldn't be able to pick between Leon Draisaitl or Connor McDavid in the Hart Trophy race.
 "Co-winners," Holland joked to reporters Tuesday at the NHL GM meetings. "They're both great players and they're both having great seasons."
 Even that's an understatement for the Oilers' stars.
 Draisaitl leads the NHL with 107 points, while McDavid was second with 94 heading into Tuesday's action despite missing six games last month with a quad injury.
 The duo torched the Nashville Predators for 10 points in Monday's 8-3 victory — Draisaitl had four goals, including a hat trick in the third period, and an assist, while McDavid scored once and set up four others.
 "They're just really starting to come into their prime," said Holland, in his first season with Edmonton after a long tenure in Detroit. "On an every-night basis, they're obviously the two guys that are going to impact our team."
 They also present an interesting dilemma when it comes to the Hart Trophy, which is voted on by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association and awarded annually to "the player judged most valuable to his team."
 But with Draisaitl and McDavid at the top of the scoring race and the Oilers looking primed for a return to the playoffs, how can you pick one over the other? And if one wins, where should the other slot in on a ballot?
 It's a conundrum writers will have to wrestle with from now until the end of the schedule, but what's clear is Draisaitl has taken his game up another notch in 2019-20.
 "He made a leap last year," Holland said. "He was the first player in six years to score 50 goals and 100 points in the same season (in 2018-19). Whenever you do something that nobody in the league has done in the previous five seasons, you've made a leap.
 "He's backed up last year's season and taken another step."
 That included the six-game stretch without McDavid where Draisaitl had four goals and 12 points to lead Edmonton to a 3-2-1 record minus its captain.
 "He stepped up, we needed him," Holland said. "We were counting on him to take a step up and he certainly did that."
 The Oilers often played McDavid, who's coming off a serious knee injury suffered last April, and Draisaitl on the same line under the previous regime due to a lack of offensive punch and skill further down the lineup.
 It was a potent top unit, but also made matchups easier for opponents.
 Head coach Dave Tippett, who was hired by Holland after he took over in May, started with the 23-year-old McDavid and the 24-year-old Draisaitl on the same line in October, but has been able to keep the dynamic duo mostly apart since late December after Kailer Yamamoto was recalled from the American Hockey League.
 Draisaitl has found great chemistry down the middle with the rookie and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, while McDavid continues to do his thing regardless of who lines up on his wings.
 Holland gave credit to Tippett for convincing McDavid and Draisaitl that splitting them up and spreading their talent across two lines was the right move. He also gave a nod to the players.
 "We're trying to have them have similar success not playing together," Holland said. "They had to be on board.
 "Everybody's got their little piece of the pie, their contribution to us being successful. Everybody feels good about themselves. But certainly those two guys are the two guys that stir the drink."
 After taking the job last spring, Holland had a short-term goal of being in the playoff race on March 1.
 He also knew not to underestimate his two stars and core that included Nugent- Hopkins, as well as defencemen Darnell Nurse, Oscar Klefbom and Adam Larsson.
 "I came to a team that had Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl," he said. "We had the nucleus of a good hockey team. We just had to figure out how to make it a little bit different, make it a little bit better."
 Winning the Hart Trophy would be the first NHL award for Draisaitl.
 McDavid, meanwhile, already has one, and he has twice grabbed the Art Ross Trophy as the league leader in points. He also owns a Ted Lindsay Award for league MVP as voted on by fellow players.
 But it's not like McDavid is Draisaitl's only competition. David Pastrnak of the Boston Bruins and Nathan MacKinnon of the Colorado Avalanche, among others, also have a strong case.
 The definition of the Hart and Ted Lindsay are also slightly different, which makes picking the former tricky when two players from the same team are in the running.
 And Holland is happy to stay out of the debate.
 "I'm glad I don't have to vote."
 GENERAL MANAGERS VOTE TO TWEAK OFFSIDE RULE
 GMs voted Tuesday to amend the interpretation of the offside rule so that a player's skate off the ice, but above the blue-line, will be considered legal — much like the goal line in football. The league has looked at the issue before, but it was pushed through this time and will now go to the NHL/NHLPA competition committee. Final approval has to come from the board of governors. The league said through 1,015 games this season, 14 goals that were overturned on coaches challenges would have stood under the proposed amendment.
 TRACKING REMAINS ON COURSE
 The NHL said puck and player tracking remains on course to be implemented in the playoffs, and across the league beginning next season.

 WADDELL ON EBUG, MRAZEK
 Carolina Hurricanes GM Don Waddell was "nervous" when emergency backup goalie David Ayres let in the first two shots he faced against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Feb. 22 after both James Reimer (lower-body) and Petr Mrazek (concussion) were lost to injury. But the 42-year-old Zamboni driver settled down to make the next eight saves in a stunning 6-3 victory. "It all worked out for the best," said Waddell, who added Mrazek is between a week and 10 days from returning to the lineup. Carolina, which made last season's Eastern Conference final, currently sits outside the playoff picture.

According to an incident report, officers were called Saturday to the Phoenix Recovery Center regarding a resident “who was kicking out windows and acting aggressively.”
 By the time officers arrived on scene, Kidwell had reportedly calmed down. However, he was acting as if he was “under the influence of methamphetamine,” King noted in his report.
 At first, the report states King asked Kidwell if he was OK. The 40-year-old said he was fine and also admitted to kicking in the windows before asking the officer if he was going to shoot him.
 Once the officer said he would not shoot Kidwell, the man turned around and headed back inside his residence.
 “I asked him to hold on and began to ask him what was going on again,” King wrote in his report. “The male began making statements that did not make any sense, talking about voices in his head. His sporadic behavior was consistent with someone under the influence of methamphetamine.”
 Because the 40-year-old had cut off the ankle monitor that was required by his parole officer, responding officers opted to handcuff him while they searched the apartment. The officers moved to search the apartment due to Kidwell’s suspicious behavior and because he had a search waiver on file, the report states. However, as the officers attempted to handcuff Kidwell, the 40-year- old started acting combative toward the officers.
 “When Ofc. [Matthew] Edgmon attempted to gain control of the male’s left hand, I reached for his right,” King wrote in his report. The male then backed away, saying ‘no I am not’ and took a fighting-style stance. As I attempted to grab the male’s right arm, I got a hold of his shirt and attempted to pull him towards me. At this time, the shirt began to tear and the male began to swing closed fists at me.”
 Though the officer “blocked a majority of the strikes,” he said Kidwell struck him not he right cheek bone and possibly cut his chin with a fingernail.
 Eventually, the officers subdued Kidwell and searched the apartment.
 No contraband was found inside Kidwell’s apartment, the report states.
 Online records show the Conway man is currently behind bars in the Faulkner County Detention Center and scheduled to appear next March 16 in circuit court for a plea and arraignment hearing regarding the allegations against him.

“We are getting calls everyday from women who are being held in slavery like conditions,” says Banchi Yimer. Banchi, a former domestic worker in Lebanon herself, founded Egna Legna Besidet, a Lebanon based Ethiopian domestic worker rights organization. The group’s hotline numbers and social media portals are flooded, she says, with calls from Ethiopians complaining about their employers refusing to pay them.
 “Women who need the money to support children and elderly parents back home in Ethiopia are being forced to work for months without pay. I am aware that many Lebanese households are struggling to make ends meet, but we encounter far too many cases of financially capable employers using the convenience of the economic crisis to avoid paying their employees. It’s exploitation.”
 A large number of domestic workers are being forced to work without pay with employers using the economic crisis as a pretext, forcing many to contemplate escaping
 It’s a grim, mundane existence for those locked up in homes with no prospects of being paid soon. There have been social media sightings of posts by Lebanese attempting to sell their Ethiopian workers, as if the women were tradable commodities. Escapees may be free from the bondage of an employer’s home but belonging to the lowest paid sector of the country’s workforce means domestic workers will find it considerably harder to get by with layoffs and rising living costs.

 We have a very dangerous attitude in the White House. COVID-19 is a clear and present danger. It is not a hoax dreamed up by the president's opponents to bring him down. Worldwide, tens of thousands have been infected and hundreds have died. COVID-19 is advancing on the U.S.
   
 Elected officials have a duty to the citizenry to be ready and able to protect everyone. The president's wishing that COVID-19 goes away is not a plan -- it is lunacy.
   
 Mandating that all coronavirus-related communications must now go through Katie Miller, Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary, is un-American and delusional. Rumors will proliferate at a time when we need fact-based information.

 In light of the recent American Pets Alive conference, let's talk about animal sheltering.
   
 Through persistent criticism and advocacy on the part of Fix Austin, leadership in City Council, and direct rescue on the part of Austin Pets Alive!, Austin pioneered no-kill sheltering. In the years since then, the pioneers have become the status quo, more interested in their image than in strengthening the safety net for animals in need.
   
 The high save rate relies on free adoptions with minimal screening, sometimes putting animals at risk. Friendly cats and kittens are put on the streets. Dogs who need training are adopted out "as is."
   
 Many volunteers are afraid to speak out. We need a renewed commitment to no- kill sheltering -- to lifesaving and quality of life -- on the part of shelter management, city and county officials, and the public.

This past fall’s elections shifted legislative control from Republicans to Democrats. But still, the amendment easily cleared the Senate this session. House Democrats should follow suit, and not turn their back on reform.
 The current system doesn’t encourage the fair drawing of districts. Instead, it enables politicians to create ridiculously shaped boundaries that benefit themselves, not voters. Gerrymandering results in costly lawsuits that take years and millions of taxpayer dollars to resolve. As we’ve advocated, the best way to ensure lasting reform is to amend the Virginia Constitution to create a legally binding commission.
 The House can stop this travesty by joining the Senate and voting for the amendment. Delegates already missed an opportunity last month when Democratic leaders effectively killed the House version by letting a deadline lapse. It’s time to step up for good government.

ALBANY -- A Westchester County man has tested positive for the coronavirus disease despite no known travel links to countries at the center of the outbreak, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday morning.
 The 50-year-old man, who lives in New Rochelle and works as an attorney in Manhattan, remains in at the NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center in Manhattan and is in serious condition.
 He has an "underlying respiratory illness" that has made him more vulnerable to the disease's effects, according to Cuomo.
 The case marks New York's second confirmed case of the coronavirus, following a health care worker from Manhattan who remains quarantined in her apartment after returning from Iran.
 Unlike the first case, the New Rochelle man had not recently traveled to China, Italy, Iran or other countries hit hardest by coronavirus, raising concern that it could have spread locally.
 "We said for the past several weeks that with this coronavirus situation, you're going to see continued spreading and that spreading is inevitable," Cuomo said at a news conference at the state Capitol.
 "I said you'll start to see community spread cases where you can't track it back directly to one place or one visit, and I think that's what we're seeing today."
 The New Rochelle man first became ill Feb. 22, according to Demetre Daskalakis, New York City's deputy health commissioner for disease control.
 He was admitted to NewYork-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville on Thursday and was treated there before he was transferred Monday to the Columbia hospital.
 A test processed overnight at the New York City Public Health Laboratory confirmed the man had the coronavirus disease.
 The NewYork-Presbyterian hospital system issued a statement Tuesday, noting it had been ready for a coronavirus case.
 "We have been planning and preparing for this situation, and are following rigorous, CDC-recommended isolation procedures for the health and safety of all of our patients, employees, medical staff and visitors," according to the statement.
 The New Rochelle man has four children, including one who lived at home and attended SAR Academy, according to Westchester County Executive George Latimer.
 The academy, a Jewish day school in the Bronx, voluntarily closed Tuesday amid amid coronavirus concerns. Two other Jewish schools, Westchester Day School and the Westchester Torah Academy, also closed Tuesday, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.
 One of the man's other children attends college in New York City and lives on campus, Latimer said. The remaining two were in Israel.
 The man's wife and two children in the country are under quarantine in their New Rochelle home, where they're being monitored for any potential symptoms, according to Latimer. The student at SAR Academy was not exhibiting any coronavirus symptoms as of Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said.
 They were among 12 people who remain under quarantine in Westchester as their potential symptoms are monitored, including "a couple" medical professionals who had contact with the New Rochelle man, according to Latimer.
 Major questions remained Tuesday afternoon about who the patient may have come into contact with while he was infected.
 While the man had recently traveled to Miami, state Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said he had gone "a while back" before he was contagious.
 Cuomo said the state, which recently received federal approval for its own coronavirus test, is quarantining two families in the Buffalo area who recently traveled to Italy, though lab results remain pending.

LONDON -- Do London Metal Exchange (LME) stock movements have any market significance?
 There was a distant time when everyone thought so. The LME's daily stocks report was eagerly awaited for the light it shone on what was happening in the "real" physical metal markets.
 If the report contained a surprise, such as a major delivery onto LME warrant, the market was collectively swift to price in the information.
 That perceived relationship between LME stocks and metal prices, however, has been steadily eroded over the years as the market has learnt that movements of metal on and off exchange are more likely to be down to storage than market drivers.
 The growth of a shadow LME storage network has further blurred any direct read-through from stock movements to underlying physical market dynamics.
 Just occasionally, however, the LME's daily stocks report does still generate a significant price response.
 Such was the case last Wednesday, Feb. 26, when the report showed 62,325 tonnes of copper "arrivals."
 It was the largest single-day delivery of copper on record so the slide in the copper price after the report's release was not entirely surprising.
 However, the speed of the price reaction says a lot about who is still really paying attention to LME stocks. And it isn't us humans.
 "ARRIVAL" EVENTS
 The "arrival" of so much metal in the LME warehouse system over the course of a single day wouldn't phase your average aluminum trader, given a long history of mega-tonnage movement in that market.
 However, it was a record for copper, although not without precedent.
 In fact, such copper "arrival events" have become ever more frequent over the last couple of years, large tonnages of metal turning up in the LME warehouse system over a concentrated time frame. An even larger tonnage, 74,475 tonnes, was warranted over the course of just two days in January.
 These are not really "arrivals" in the true sense of the word. Such significant tonnages of metal don't just turn up at port, get unloaded, placed into an LME warehouse and warranted in a 24-hour period.
 Particularly when the inflow is split across several locations as was the case with last week's copper deliveries. Metal hit the system in sizeable quantities at New Orleans (20,000 tonnes), Kaohsiung in Taiwan (12,675 tonnes), Busan in South Korea (16,675 tonnes) and Rotterdam (9,450 tonnes)
 Rather, this is metal that was already sitting in an LME shed or at least in very close proximity. The "arrival" occurs when the owner presses the computer button to place the metal on LME warrant.
 And the owner in this case evidently coordinated the warranting to achieve maximum market impact.
 PRICE IMPACT
 And whoever was behind the inflow did indeed make an impact.
 It's not evident from a daily chart, which shows LME three-month copper opening and closing the day at the same price of $5,670 per tonne.
 Indeed, in the rear-view chart picture the day's trading activity looks no more than a pause in a mini downtrend that saw copper slide from a Feb. 17 high of $5,828 to a Feb. 28 low of $5,533 as fears over the coronavirus spread.
 However, the real action played out over a much shorter period of time.
 Within a minute of the stocks report release copper had fallen by $18 per tonne with volumes on the LME's Select electronic platform spiking to 555 lots.
 Even that, however, doesn't capture the full speed of the price reaction.
 The stocks report was released on Refinitiv screens at 09.00.16 on that particular day and within the following second 89 lots (2,225 tonnes) traded with the price skidding from $5,666 to $5,658 per tonne.
 There were clusters of trades timed around specific nanoseconds such as the 11 lots that changed hands at 09.00.17.690 and the 15 lots at 0900.17.720.
 These, remember, are completed trades. The interplay of bid and offer was happening at sub-nanosecond speed, a sure sign that high-frequency trading programs were the protagonists behind the price move.
 The robots, in other words, were trading the stocks report within the time it would have taken a human mind to do a fast double-take on the size of the copper inflow that day.
 SUPER-FAST BUT BEHIND THE CURVE
 The price reaction to last Wednesday's stocks surge underlines the extent to which robots have been programmed to respond to unusual LME stock movements.
 This is not in itself surprising since robots feed on data and the LME stocks report provides one of the few daily hard data points in the base metals trading universe.
 However, it does pose some interesting questions as to what is the definition of a tradeable stocks movement.
 Obviously, 62,325 tonnes of arrivals, generating a net stocks increase of 61,175 tonnes is hardly a normal daily occurrence.
 But in the context of the copper market over the last years it's not a black swan event either. There have been over 20 incidences of outsized copper arrivals in the LME warehouse system since the middle of 2016. Several of them have been bigger, albeit extended over two or three days.
 Ask a human copper trader and the chances are that they will shrug and point to the long-running battle between two major copper players with differing views of the market. One throws metal into the system, the other cancels it and takes it out again.
 The "arrival" of so much metal may indeed say something about the state of the underlying market but the message has been massaged by the entity delivering the metal.
 In the case of aluminum, it's the gaming of warehouse incentives that generates much of the visible stocks movements in the LME system. What comes in and goes out says little of value about the state of the aluminum market other than that there's a lot of metal out there. Which we all know.
 This is why many human metals traders have grown skeptical that LME stock movements actually mean anything.
 How ironic then that the robots have yet to learn the ambiguities of the LME storage system, treating each unusual data point as a meaningful price signal.
 Sure they can react faster, but they're around 10 years behind the curve in terms of what they're reacting to.
