SILVERTON, OR (KPTV) - Small Brewery Sunday is a day that places emphasis on supporting and buying from local brewpubs and taprooms. The owner, Eric Druline, at Silver Fall Brewery in Silverton, said these days are important because small businesses cannot survive alone.
 “It does help because there’s a lot of people that don’t really know us yet,” he said. “And so by doing some kind of promotion or some advertising or word of mouth to kind of seek these smaller breweries out, it’s great.”
 Silver Falls Brewery has been open for three and a half years. Druline said they’ve been expanding ever since.
