The team honed skills in defensive counter air, offensive counter air, combat search and rescue, and air refueling. Ground personnel and aircrew also practiced alert scrambles and forward air refueling point operations of F-15 and F-16 aircraft from C-130s, an essential part of PACAF’s focus on agile combat employment," said Lt Col Craig Van Beusekom, Rumrunner 3.0 airboss and 67th Fighter Squadron commander

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say Florida police officers fatally shot a Black armed robbery suspect. Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan said the two officers confronted 26-year-old Dominique Mulkey on Tuesday morning, minutes after he left a Dollar General store. Police say store employees had attempted to stop Mulkey from stuffing items into a trash bag until he pulled out a gun. Body camera video shows the officers draw their weapons and order Mulkey to get on the ground and to drop his gun multiples times. The video shows Mulkey turning instead toward the officers, who open fire.

 MADRID, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Spain's parliament on Tuesday gave the green light to the government to exceptionally suspend fiscal straightjacket rules in order to help the economy cope with the coronavirus pandemic.
 The minority government's proposal to suspend the commitment to any deficit targets for two years and allow Spain to spend and borrow at will was passed by 208-1 votes with 138 abstentions following recent recommendations from the International Monetary Fund aimed at reviving the economy.
 The regulations on deficit and debt ceilings were built into the constitution in 2011 during the euro zone debt crisis.
 IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva warned last week that halting spending aimed at containing the pandemic and its economic impact could have serious consequences for the global economy.
 "The suspension of the fiscal rules does not imply a suspension of fiscal responsibility," Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero told parliament before the vote, assuring that when circumstances allow it, Spain would reimpose the rules.
 In a faltering voice, which she attributed to her continuing recovery from the coronavirus, Elvira Rodriguez of the conservative opposition People's Party announced PP's abstention in the vote, which guaranteed the approval.
 Hailed by Germany as an example to other nations at the time, the constitutional change approved by a previous Socialist government in 2011 with the backing from the PP has been heavily criticised by the hard-left Unidas Podemos, which is now part of the Socialist-led ruling coalition.
 Then, the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank forced Spain, in exchange for a banking sector bailout, to adopt fiscal stability rules binding it to EU structural deficit targets in order to convince the markets of its unwavering commitment to sound public finances.
 As the pandemic struck Europe in March, the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers suspended the Stability and Growth Pact, which normally limits government spending and borrowing, but Spain's commitments still formally remained in place.
 The constitution says parliament can allow for the deficit and debt ceilings to be surpassed in case of natural disasters, economic recession or emergency events outside the state's control.
 The government expects a recession of 11.2% - the worst since the civil war - and a budget gap of 11.3% this year.
 Next year, the euro zone's fourth-largest economy should rebound 7.2% and the deficit is projected at 7.7%, according to the draft budget.
 Spain only managed to bring its deficit below the European Union's threshold of 3% from 2018, exiting the bloc's corrective procedure for excessive deficits last year. Its pre-pandemic deficit target for this year was 1.8% of GDP, and public debt was expected to end the year 94.5% of GDP.
 The latest official projection puts debt at 118%.

 The City Council on Tuesday voted 4-3 to reject a 10-year contract with NebraskaLand Recycling, which had submitted the lowest bid of $2.28 million a year to process the paper, plastic and aluminum that the city’s waste hauler picks up at Omaha residents’ curbs.
 Council members emphasized their support for city recycling, but some had outstanding questions about whether NebraskaLand has the space and operational capacity to take on the 15,000 to 20,000 tons of recyclables that Omaha produces each year.

As for the former vice president, his public financial disclosures, along with the income tax returns he voluntarily released, show no income or business dealings of his own in China. However, there is ample evidence of Trump’s efforts to join the myriad American firms that have long done business there — and the tax records for him and his companies that were obtained by The Times offer new details about them.
 As with Russia, where he explored hotel and tower projects in Moscow without success, Trump has long sought a licensing deal in China. His efforts go at least as far back as 2006, when he filed trademark applications in Hong Kong and the mainland. Many Chinese government approvals came after he became president. (The president’s daughter Ivanka Trump also won Chinese trademark approvals for her personal business after she joined the White House staff.)
 In 2008, Trump pursued an office tower project in Guangzhou that never got off the ground. But his efforts accelerated in 2012 with the opening of a Shanghai office, and tax records show that one of Trump’s China-related companies, THC China Development LLC, claimed $84,000 in deductions that year for travel costs, legal fees and office expenses.
 After effectively planting his flag there, Trump found a partner in the State Grid Corp., one of the nation’s largest government-controlled enterprises. Agence France-Presse reported in 2016 that the partnership would have involved licensing and managing a development in Beijing. Trump was reportedly still pursuing the deal months into his first presidential campaign, but it was abandoned after State Grid became ensnared in a corruption investigation by Chinese authorities.
 It is difficult to determine from the tax records precisely how much money Trump has spent trying to land business in China. The records show that he has invested at least $192,000 in five small companies created specifically to pursue projects there over the years. Those companies claimed at least $97,400 in business expenses since 2010, including some minor payments for taxes and accounting fees as recently as 2018.
 But Trump’s plans in China have been largely driven by a different company, Trump International Hotels Management — the one with a Chinese bank account.

PARIS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Manchester United triumphed at Paris St Germain again, but Tuesday's Champions League victory was not as euphoric as the previous one, according to coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
 United's previous trip to Paris in 2019 ended with Marcus Rashford scoring an injury-time penalty that secured qualification for the quarter-finals on away goals, while Tuesday's 2-1 win was just a stepping stone in Group H.
 "It's a different feeling from the last time we won here, it's at the start of the group stage but we've beaten a fantastic team," said Solskjaer after Rashford again netted the winner, three minutes from fulltime.
 "Last time it was a knockout and it was euphoric, this is sterile without the fans but it's still excellent and we deserved to win."
 The game was played in an empty stadium amid the COVID-19 crisis.
 United next take on RB Leipzig, who lead the group after beating Istanbul Basaksehir 2-0.
 "We know we need 10 points to get through so next week's game is very important. There are so many games," Solskjaer said.
 There was a lot on show to enjoy, however, as Rashford again played chief tormentor at the Parc des Princes.
 "Of course it's a nice feeling. More importantly, we won the game. We're in a strong position now in the group but it's the first game. The concentration levels we showed today we have to take forward into the next game," the striker said.
 United also showed steel in defence, with Axel Tuanzebe making light work of Kylian Mbappe and Neymar in his first game in 10 months for the Premier League side.
 "He has been unbelievable today," keeper David De Gea said. "He played against two of the best players in the world in Neymar and Mbappe so he did really, really well. I am really happy for him.
 "He has been in difficult moments with the injuries but now he has shown today that he is capable of playing in big games."
 For Rashford, the key was the concentration and poise shown by the team against last season's runners-up PSG.
 "Every game requires different tactics and a different performance but what has to stay the same is the intensity," he said.
 "The intensity was key for us tonight. We kept going for 90 minutes." (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Toby Davis)

Oct 20 (Reuters) - Real Madrid are fully focussed on Wednesday's Champions League match against Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk and will not make drastic changes to the line-up even though they face rivals Barcelona in La Liga this weekend, coach Zinedine Zidane said.
 Shakhtar have arrived in Spain without several first-team players who were not fully fit after going into isolation following positive COVID-19 tests.
 But Zidane said his players cannot afford to be complacent as they begin their pursuit of a 14th Champions League crown.
 "The other matches will then come, but the only game we're preparing for right now is tomorrow's," Zidane told a news conference on Tuesday.
 "I know that many Shakhtar Donetsk (players) cannot play but they're still competitive and have a deep squad.
 "We want to start this competition well, we know what we want to achieve but there are lots of teams who want to win the Champions League."
 Real were well below par in Saturday's shock 1-0 La Liga defeat by newly- promoted Cadiz, mustering just two shots on target despite dominating ball possession.
 Zidane said the players deserved criticism that came their way but they will have opportunities to redeem themselves in a busy campaign.
 "Now it's our opportunity to turn the tide, turn that corner and hopefully you'll see a different Real Madrid," Zidane added.
 Real captain Sergio Ramos sustained a knee injury against Cadiz and was absent from Tuesday's training session.
 With the first 'El Clasico' of the season against Barcelona scheduled for Saturday, Zidane plans to assess the Spanish centre back's fitness ahead of kick off on Wednesday.
 "He didn't train with us this morning because we didn't want to risk him," Zidane said. "He's got a knock, we have to wait and see how he feels." (Reporting by Manasi Pathak in Chennai, editing by Pritha Sarkar)

LEIPZIG, Germany, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Midfielder Angelino struck twice in four minutes to give RB Leipzig a 2-0 victory over Istanbul Basaksehir on Tuesday and help them to make a winning start in the Champions League group stage.
 Leipzig, last season's surprise semi-finalists who are unbeaten in all competitions so far this season, went in search of a quick goal and after a few early chances Angelino put them in the driving seat in the 16th minute.
 The 23-year-old, on loan from Manchester City since January, turned into an accomplished centre forward when he beautifully controlled a Kevin Kampl cross into the box with a fine first touch, pivoted on the spot and fired in for the lead.
 He completed a quick counter attack four minutes later after the Turks lost possession in their own half.
 Angelino, who has already scored twice in four Bundesliga games, came close to a hat-trick a little later but his powerful volley straight from a corner kick whizzed past the post.
 Basaksehir, making their maiden group-stage appearance, managed to keep up for the opening 20 minutes but were then on the back foot.
 They controlled possession in the second half but failed to carve out any real scoring chances against the disciplined German backline.
 Leipzig have three points in Group H, along with Manchester United who beat Paris St Germain 2-1. The Germans next play United in Manchester on Oct. 28. (Reporting by Karolos Grohmann; editing by Clare Fallon)

THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) — Kyle Berkshire spent two years playing for the University of North Texas before his golf path switched over to power, and he capped off his remarkable surge by winning the World Long Drive Championship last year. He is a main inspiration for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who is striving to hit the ball as far as he can. They have never met in person, but they speak regularly on the phone. It's a two-way street. “He helps me out a little bit with the golf side, so it works out pretty good,” Berkshire said. “He's trying to gain distance. I'm trying to sharpen my game.” Berkshire, a 23-year-old from Maryland whose ball speed has topped out — so far — at about 230 mph, is ready to return to the more conventional game and hopes to eventually earn his way into tour events. He said his handicap is at plus-3, still not quite where it was at North Texas, but he's making progress. And he's learned that working on his short game and shot-making is not affecting his ability to launch shots in the World Long Drive events. “My last event I think was the best I've ever been,” he said. “The four weeks before, I didn't do any long drive. The night before the event, I was working on my wedges.” Former champion Jamie Sadlowski is the most prominent player from the World Long Drive arena to play on pro tours. He has been in two PGA Tour events, at Colonial and the Safeway Open in 2017, missing the cut in both. But he has made a number of cuts on the Mackenzie Tour in Canada, and one cut on what is now the Korn Ferry Tour in 2015. Berkshire wants to get his handicap index to a “solid (plus-)5.\" The first stop is mini-tours in Florida. “I want to develop my game so if I get offered a sponsor exemption, I can prove I belong...

 The network said McCaffrey (ankle) could return for the Week 8 game against the Atlanta Falcons on Thursday, Oct. 29.
 McCaffrey sprained his right ankle in Week 2 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He has missed the past four games.
 McCaffrey had 223 scrimmage yards (156 rushing, 67 receiving) in the two games in which he played. He rushed for four touchdowns
 McCaffrey, 24, is the NFL's highest-paid running back, thanks to a four-year, $64 million contract extension he signed in the offseason. In 2019, he gained 2,392 total yards on his way to a first-team All-Pro selection.
 In fact, McCaffrey became the third running back in league history to run for at least 1,000 yards and gain 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. He finished with 1,387 rushing yards and 1,005 receiving yards to join Roger Craig (1985) and Marshall Faulk (1999) as members of the club.
 Mike Davis has filled in as Carolina's top running back. Davis has rushed for 272 yards and two touchdowns and caught 32 passes for 209 yards and two scores.
 The Panthers (3-3) have won three of four games without McCaffrey.
 Also, Carolina placed safety Juston Burris (ribs) and Keith Kirkwood (clavicle) on injured reserve. The Panthers signed safety Kenny Robinson and offensive lineman Sam Tecklenburg off their practice squad to fill the roster openings.

PROVINCETOWN -- When a worldwide health crisis shutters theaters and cancels shows from Cape Cod to Broadway and beyond, what's a theater auteur and master of provocation to do? For Ryan Landry, the way through the pandemic, and a fallow season for the Gold Dust Orphans, was to retrace his steps to the visual arts.
 "Theater has been my livelihood for 40 years," Landry said as he perched at his easel, painting a scene from "A Woman Under the Influence," commissioned by the actor John Cameron Mitchell. Quiet and sunlit, the studio where he works is tucked behind a garden filled with sunflowers.
 As he mixed dabs of color to paint Gena Rowlands' hand on the canvas, he reflected on the state of live performance. "It's really suffering right now and I had no other way to make money,'' he said. "I used to paint when I was younger, so I started doing this."
 Landry has other orders to fill: Performers Rufus Wainwright, Parker Posey, Jennifer Coolidge, Margaret Cho and others have commissioned his work, and he is selling more paintings as well as other artsy merchandise on a new website, ryanlandryfactory.com. Although most of his available work has already sold online, Landry recently had a show at his house.
 "The town gave me a little problem with that," he said, quickly adding that Provincetown Licensing Agent Linda Fiorella was very nice. "But you can't tell me I can't show my work to my friends on my property. We call ourselves an art colony and an artist can't show his work? What am I supposed to do? In COVID time, I'm going to take the bull by the horns and try to get money coming in."
 Landry's studio, which began life as a mule shed, feels like a place an art colonist would have inhabited in the 1800s, with doors open wide to afternoon breezes. The laptop gives it away, as does the table behind him, covered with paintings of Divine, Dina Martina, Kathleen Turner, and a night view of the harbor. His work ranges from color-saturated renderings of iconic stars to landscapes and floral studies.
 "I just do whatever I want," Landry said. "I don't think about my style. I think that will just come from me being myself."
 Before moving to Cape Cod, Landry studied at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan until he ran out of money. "I tried going to The Art Students League but I couldn't afford that either," he said. "It's difficult to pay rent and go to school when you don't have any other means. So I stopped. I got turned on to theater, and was so into it I stayed for 40 years."
 More recently, he's studied at New Orleans Academy of Fine Arts with Auseklis Ozols. In a statement on the Academy's website, Ozols says, "At the New Orleans Academy of Fine Arts, we strive to better ourselves in the art of seeing -- first seeing the world around us and then the world within us."
 Following Landry from the studio to the house, minding the grapes dropping from an overhead arbor on the way, you find yourself in a space preserved in time. An architectural palimpsest, the house is as Cape Cod as it gets.
 "I honor the Cape every day," Landry said. "If it wasn't for the Cape, I think I'd be dead by now. I started performing here and that saved me from the drugs."
 One room holds the piano where Landry is working with Billy Hough on a parody opera based on "The Bad Seed," starring Justin Vivian Bond. Another room is where Landry writes.
 "I'm finally writing again," he said. "I do need to write or I go crazy."
 Landry is prolific. Rounding out a quest for sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, Landry formed and was the frontman of the band Space Pussy before founding the theater group Gold Dust Orphans. (The group was called Playhouse '69 before becoming the Gold Dust Orphans in 1995.) Landry won an Elliot Norton Award for Sustained Excellence in theater in 2015. Two of his plays, "M" and "Psyched," have been produced by the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston, where his bio notes that he is a working writer, director and performer who "plans to keep writing plays until he drops dead."
 Landry didn't stage a Gold Dust Orphans show this season. He said he didn't want to be the one that had an outbreak. "It's obviously a very serious thing. Some people say it's going to be a good restart button, but couldn't there have been any other restart?"
 The next Gold Dust Orphans play in progress is "Jerusalem Park," which features the nativity play being destroyed by a tyrannosaur.
 "I thought it up while drinking some wine with my other Orphan friends. This is how we always come up with the show," Landry said. Past Gold Dust Orphans productions include "Nightmare on Elf Street," "Murder on the Polar Express" and "Mildred Fierce." "Jerusalem Park" is slated for performance in winter 2021.
 "I believe in creating until you spontaneously combust," he said. "The human potential is so vast that there's really no excuse not to create, to feed your soul. Especially if you have a passion. Creativity can be a zillion things. Everything's an art."
 The next exhibit of Landry's paintings will be in December at Provincetown Commons. In the spring, he says, he'll have another show at home.
 As for the town's restrictions, he is moderating his stance. "We have other things to worry about, like the climate and the President and justice for all," he said. But he'll get an entertainment license, because Fiorella was so nice.

A new state-supported Covid-19 testing site is open as of today, Oct. 20, at Seaside High School. It will be open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 8am-8pm for appointments but will also take a limited number of walk-ins from 4-7pm.
 Originally, the testing site was in Greenfield but lower attendance there led to closing it as of Oct. 17 and then relocating to Seaside.
 The best way to access testing services at the site is to make an appointment at lhi.care/covidtesting or by calling 1-888-634-1123, according to the Monterey County Health Department. Appointments can also be made at a site in Salinas.
 Health Officer Edward Moreno told the Monterey County Board of Supervisors Tuesday that the lag time between being tested and receiving results has decreased within the last two weeks, from about 2.3 days to 1.5 days on average.
 "We do see improvements as most, if not all, laboratories approved have managed to make adjustments," he said. Earlier in the pandemic, test results could take over two weeks to come back.

Garten would not comment on the specific amount cited by Bloomberg, but said that the contract buyout represented a “significant portion” of the company’s revenue and that the remaining money was not related to China.
 Outside of China, Trump has had more success attracting wealthy Chinese buyers for his properties in other countries. His hotels and towers in Las Vegas and Vancouver, British Columbia — locales known for attracting Chinese real estate investors — have found numerous Chinese purchasers, and in at least one instance drew the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
 During the 2016 campaign, a shell company controlled by a Chinese couple from Vancouver bought 11 units, for $3.1 million, in the Las Vegas tower Trump co- owns with the casino magnate Phil Ruffin. The owner of a Las Vegas-based financial services firm told The Times he was later visited by two FBI agents asking about the company behind the purchases, which he said had used his office address in incorporation papers without his knowledge. It is not known what became of the inquiry.

It's easier to understand now why Gov. Charlie Baker didn't want to cancel Halloween. He had his costume all picked out. And no he's not dressing as Donald Trump.
 Whether by sleight of hand or happenstance, Baker, the budgetary magician, managed to take a lot of the sting this week out of an exercise in fiscal obligation that legislators had been wringing their hands over for months, spooked by the pain it would inflict.
 The longer Washington took to fight over the next stimulus package, the longer Beacon Hill could put off its inevitable need to pass a balanced budget for the year. Even, and maybe most importantly, if that meant waiting until after the election.
 That can-kicking stopped Wednesday, Oct. 14.
 Baker waved his wand and updated the state's revenue forecast to reflect a $3.6 billion drop in tax collections compared to what had been projected back in January. It was better than the $5 billion to $8 billion once feared, but it wasn't couch change either. Then for his next act, Baker submitted a revised state budget to the Legislature that actually increased proposed spending by about $900 million from his January plan, tipping the scales at $45.5 billion for the year.
 "Pretty neat trick, huh?" Baker said, smiling wryly at a question about how he accomplished that feat.
 But it didn't take David Copperfield to unravel how he did it. A combination of federal relief money and tapping the state's "rainy day" savings fund to the tune of $1.35 billion got the budget almost all the way back to black. Add in another $515 million in savings squeezed out of agency budgets by asking them to forgo increases from fiscal year 2020 and voila.
 The governor's budget did not raise any new broad-based taxes and incorporated the final, mandated drop in the income tax to 5 percent in January, but he also delayed a charitable giving tax deduction and reproposed a accelerated method for collecting sales taxes that would net the state $267 million in one-time revenue, but has been rejected as unworkable by the Legislature more than once.
 The MBTA also continues to contemplate major service reductions as MassHealth, the state's Medicaid program, consumes much of the proposed spending growth in the budget, and schools are being told to wait on the full funding promised in last year's Student Opportunity Act.
 Needless to say, Baker's updated budget recommendation was just the start of the process, and one the governor optimistically said he'd like to see wrapped up by Thanksgiving.
 While that may take another act of magic to accomplish, Senate Ways and Means Chairman Michael Rodrigues called it a "responsible" plan that gives the Legislature a "good foundation" to build their own budgets - even if that foundation is built on one-time money.
 A virtual hearing on the governor's revised budget has been planned, and the timeline after that remains anyone's guess. The budget revision came on the heels of Baker throwing more money at another problem: housing stability.
 Prepared to let the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures expire, the administration released a plan Monday that it developed with Trial Court Chief Justice Paula Carey to try to stem the rising tide of eviction proceedings by increasing rental assistance by $100 million and bolstering landlord-tenant mediation and other supports.
 Without knowing exactly how many residents are at risk of losing their homes, Baker said it was too risky to let tenants continue to accumulate debt if they can't afford to pay their rents. Many advocates applauded the direction the proposal took, but some said the governor's $171 million plan won't address the true needs.
 Demonstrators and political leaders, from state Rep. Kevin Honan to U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley and Attorney General Maura Healey, continued to pressure Baker all week to extend the moratorium, at least until he could get his own program up and running. But they did so in the face of overwhelming evidence that the governor had no intention of taking that step.
 Rep. Mike Connolly of Cambridge even tried Thursday, Oct. 15, to force passage of an emergency petition to extend the moratorium until January, but the furthest he got was getting the bill admitted to the House.
 Connolly said at the very least his petition would give Baker more time to get the tenant and landlord support services that are part of his own plan up and running.
 And at most, it would give legislators like him and Honan more time to convince leadership on Beacon Hill to pass a popular housing stability bill that would not only extend the moratorium until a year after the health emergency is lifted, but also freeze rents during that time.
 As it stands, the moratorium was lifted over the weekend. But that doesn't preclude legislative action in the days or weeks to come.
 "When you think about the concerns of our constituents, the challenges facing the commonwealth, I would like us to actually utilize the abilities we have to make policy and pass legislation," Connolly said, expressing his frustration that neither the House nor the Senate has met in a formal session since July 31, despite voting to extend formal sessions beyond that date in part to deal with pandemic-related issues.
 Now the middle of October, Massachusetts has seen its average daily COVID-19 case rate over the past two weeks climb to 8.7 cases per 100,000, which would put it in the state's own highest risk "red" category if it were a city or town.
 But Massachusetts is not a town. And Baker made clear that he's not putting much stock in where Massachusetts stands collectively on the virus transmission scale, just where communities stand. Because, he said, there continue to be many, many municipalities where COVID-19 is contained.
 Still, 27 more cities and towns moved into the highest risk category this week, bringing the total to 64 of the 351 municipalities, including many of the the state's largest cities.
 "There's no question that there will be more cases this fall," Baker said.
 Good thing Massachusetts is prepared, according to the governor.
 Sandwiched between his housing announcement on Monday and his budget rollout on Wednesday, Baker staged a press conference with the lieutenant governor and multiple cabinet secretaries to tick through everything the state has done since March to respond to the pandemic, and how that experience has prepared the government to deal with a fall surge, if it arrives.
 Adequate supplies of personal protective equipment are on hand, hospitals stand ready to quickly build out ICU capacity and the state's testing and tracing program is no worse than second to one, the governor assured.
 "We've done the work. We're prepared to respond to this virus like never before," Baker said. "But our preparations are of little use without the people of Massachusetts continuing to do their part."
 In Massachusetts, that part involves wearing a mask, which President Trump continued to equivocate on the value of this week after recovering himself from COVID-19. Trump's attitude toward COVID-19 and Baker's opinion of the federal government's response to the pandemic are undoubtedly part of the reason Baker won't be voting for Trump, which the governor confirmed this week to the surprise of no one.
 Baker, however, did not endorse Joe Biden and suggested he might not vote at all.
 He could always follow the lead of his good friend and fellow anti-Trump Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, who, according to the Washington Post, wrote in Ronald Reagan on his ballot when he voted early.

The newest entry in the stand-up comic genre is a sweet, simple, low-budget film called "The Opening Act" that's about a young man named Will (Jimmy O. Yang) whose goal in life is to get up in front of crowds and make them laugh.
 A sequence at the top previews some nicely streamlined storytelling from writer-director Stephen Byrne - himself a comic and actor - with a lot going on that doesn't rely on dialogue. There's Will, as a young boy, and his father, laughing together, watching stand-up acts on TV. Their living room setting stays the same, but the film keeps jumping forward in time as they continue watching and laughing (with the boy played by different actors) at the TV over the years. That part poignantly ends with adult Will (Yang) on the couch, still watching, but now alone, not laughing, his father obviously gone.

 But his dream of doing what he's been watching is very much alive. The odds are against him. He's well aware that not many people make it in this profession. But when he's not at his day job, sitting in a cubicle, dealing with auto insurance claims for a demanding boss (Bill Burr), he's trying out material at open mic nights. He does get laughs from his audience, but he's only gone as far as a bar & grill in Steubenville, Ohio.
 The first step of that dream would be to perform at his first real club. A piece of luck comes his way when more-experienced fellow open mic comic Quinn (Ken Jeong) can't do an out-of-town emcee gig at an improv club, and offers the spot to Will.
 There's not a great deal of plotting to deal with here, which makes the film a little loose and more fun to watch. It quickly turns into a slice-of-stand-up comic-life story in which you can just sit back and keep track of Will's triumphs and travails, and wonder if he'll beat those odds.
 The club, over the border in Pennsylvania, is run by stern and seemingly humorless Chip (Neal Brennan), who reads a low key riot act to novice Will the moment he says hello. Chip's suggestion to Will is that he'd better be funny. The gig incorporates a 12-minute routine as an opener, introducing feature act Chris (Alex Moffat from "SNL"), then introducing headliner Billy G (Cedric "The Entertainer").
 Well, Chris is a great comic, but an out-of-control drinker, womanizer, and party guy. Billy G is a star comedian (though Chris considers him to be over the hill) who's kind of an unfriendly cuss to Will, especially when Will screws up his intro.
 It's a three-night gig, and the film focuses on the differences between each one of them. Will is understandably nervous, he does well, he has to deal with his first-ever hecklers, he doesn't do well, his loyalty to his loving girlfriend back home is challenged, he wonders if maybe the comedy life "isn't in the cards for me."
 Yang gives an amiable, enthusiastic performance, and you do wonder if his Will is just too much of a nice guy to be in this cutthroat business. Jeong, even with limited time here, shows a bit of his wild and crazy side at the microphone. Moffat is terrific at presenting a character who may or may not be out of control. But it's Cedric's scenes - first when his character is unapproachable and later as he offers Will some sage advice about the business - who contributes the finest acting.
 The film has a definite charm to it, along with some very funny bits. But it also serves as a cautionary tale. It says, unflinchingly, that making people laugh, even getting the opportunity to try to make people laugh, is not easy.
 "The Opening Act" is playing in theaters and is available digitally and On Demand.

TAUNTON -- City government has moved into the newly renovated, rebuilt and expanded City Hall on Summer Street.
 Mayor Shaunna O'Connell said they are excited, as it not only gives them more space and a modern set up to work with, but because it will allow them to better serve their constituents.
 "It's much more functional than where we are now at the old school. We're really excited to be moving to our beautiful, restored City Hall." O'Connell said during a recent tour "There are such beautiful views here in our building that give you a deep sense of appreciation for our community, our history and for all our citizens in the city of Taunton."
 According to the mayor's office, though most city offices are not where they used to be, the renovated building's layout is more conducive to public use for many reasons. First, if entering from the rear parking lot, the most frequented city offices are easily accessible. The city clerk and tax collector's offices are on the first floor as you enter the building, and the veteran's and registrar of voters offices are on the street level if entering from Summer Street.
 Second, the city council chamber is now handicap accessible.
 The first floor of the building, at the rear parking level, also holds the treasurer's and IT department offices. The second floor, level with Summer Street, also houses the assessor's and clerk of committee's offices. On the third floor is the office of economic and community development and the auditor's office, and the fourth floor houses the mayor's, law and budget director's offices.
 City officials moved back into the building for the first time in a decade. Originally built in 1848, it was damaged in an arson fire in 2010 which forced city government out and into a temporary city hall on Oak Street fashioned out of an old elementary school.
 After years of deliberation, construction began on the building in February 2019, and is just now concluding. The project cost $27 million.
 "A lot of work has gone into this over the last few years by people too numerous to mention, but we appreciate all our efforts," O'Connell said.
 The project preserved many of the building's history features, such as antique fireplaces and vaults. O'Connell said this is one of her favorite things about the renovated building, as it respects the city's long history.
 O'Connell also said the space and facilities at the new building stand in stark contrast to that available to them at the temporary City Hall. During the tour, she described many offices at the Oak Street building as being "like a closet."
 "It's a big difference here, and it really will give our employees the ability to serve the public so much better," she said.
 All city offices were operational in the building as of Oct. 15. Tours of the building began Saturday. Registration is required before the tour and is available on the city's website through the mayor's tab.

 WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - A key source for the private investigator's report suggesting links between Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia told Reuters on Tuesday he is not a Russian agent, contradicting two of Trump's congressional allies.
 "I am exactly what the Department of Justice National Security Division, the FBI, the FBI Inspector General, the Special Counsel and the Republican Senate Intelligence Committee has determined; an experienced expert in Russian affairs who has spent more than a decade in business intelligence," Russian politics expert Igor Danchenko told Reuters in an email.
 "My academic and business intelligence work in Russia has always been on behalf of Western clients and never on behalf of Russia," Danchenko said in his first public comments.
 Danchenko was referred to in the 2016 "Steele Dossier," prepared for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign by former British spy Christopher Steele, which alleged connections between Trump's successful campaign and Russia.
 Trump has long denied any such connection.
 Trump allies Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Representative Devin Nunes, top Republican on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, have made comments that Danchenko is a Russian agent.
 Danchenko said those comments had put him, his family and friends in danger and, through a lawyer, threatened legal action.
 In a statement, Graham said: "I have done nothing more than simply relay these matters of intense public interest to the American people, consistent with the facts before me and my responsibilities as chairman of the Judiciary Committee."
 Trump and Nunes did not respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Mark Hosenball; Editing by Peter Cooney)

 NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The coronavirus pandemic threatens to grind down progress toward gender equality that already was creeping along at a snail's pace, the United Nations said on Tuesday.
 Gender-based violence and inequities in the workplace and political leadership are nearly as bad as they were 25 years ago, the global agency said in a report "The World's Women 2020."
 Only modest gains in education and lowered maternal mortality have taken place since the U.N.'s 189 members made a commitment to women's rights at a landmark conference in Beijing in 1995, Secretary-General António Guterres said.
 "Progress towards equal power and equal rights for women remains elusive," Guterres said in a statement.
 "No country has achieved gender equality, and the COVID-19 crisis threatens to erode the limited gains that have been made."
 Not only did U.N. members make the pledge in China a quarter century ago, but achieving gender equality by 2030 was one of the global goals adopted five years ago to tackle social ills like poverty and conflict.
 The U.N. report found boys and girls are equally likely to go to primary and secondary school, and women are more likely than men to enroll in higher education, but fewer than half of women work in the paid labor market compared with three-quarters of men.
 That's the same gap that existed in 1995, it said.
 "Too many people think 'Oh, well it's good that girls are finishing school and more women are going to university,' but clearly that's not enough," said Jeni Klugman, managing director of Georgetown University's Institute for Women, Peace and Security.
 Women's workforce participation is particularly low, below 30%, in Southern Asia, Northern Africa and Western Asia, the U.N. said.
 Progress in gender parity in political leadership also is slow, the U.N. said, with only eight more female heads of state or government - monarchs, presidents or prime ministers - today than in 1995.
 The proportion of women in managerial positions is nearly the same as it was in 1995, the U.N. said.
 Slowing women's progress is the unpaid work they are likely expected to do at home, it said.
 Among single women ages 25 to 54, four out of five are employed, but if they have a partner and child, the rate drops below half, it said.
 The findings come as the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 40 million people and killed 1.1 million people worldwide, according to a Reuters tally, deepens underlying inequalities, the U.N. said.
 According to data from 38 countries and territories, women were more likely than men to be infected, possibly because about 70% of health-care workers are female, it said.
 "They are at high risk of contracting the disease, and they are also, of course, at the frontlines fighting the pandemic on behalf of everyone," said Francesca Grum, U.N. chief social and gender statistician, at a virtual media conference.
 The pandemic also reduces women's access to reproductive health care and takes up their time as children are kept out of school, the report said.

Coronavirus: Authorities suspend face to face activity in Bucharest schools

CARDIFF, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Wales loose forward Justin Tipuric anticipates some adjustment for himself and his team mates as test rugby in the northern hemisphere returns this weekend after the COVID-19 hiatus.
 "Everyone knows it's different, even the build-up is much quieter than normal which is a bit weird," he said amid a lockdown in Wales as novel coronavirus infections increase.
 Similar restrictions are in force in Paris where the Welsh meet France in a warm-up test at Stade de France on Saturday.
 "We are in a lucky position to be continuing to be doing what we are doing in a such a strange time," Tipuric told a news conference on Tuesday.
 "Hopefully this weekend we can get the Welsh public to tune in and chill out by putting a good performance on.
 "It's going to be a little weird playing again. It has been a long time out of international rugby and normally with tests you get the big crowds and all that side of it and it's going to be weird not having that."
 Tipuric, 31, said the strict heath protocols in place at the team's resort hotel and training centre took some getting used to.
 "We have our own rooms now when before we shared with someone and there are separate changing rooms for the backs and forwards. We trust in all the protocols. The best thing we can do is just concentrate on the game."
 Saturday's match is a warm-up before both countries complete their delayed Six Nations schedule on Oct. 31 when Wales host Scotland in Llanelli and France take on Ireland in Paris.
 "There is no such thing as a friendly against France. A test match is a test and we know they'll come guns blazing. They've had a good Six Nations," the British & Irish Lions flank added, which included beating Wales 27-23 in Cardiff in February. (Writing by Mark Gleeson in Cape Town; Editing by Ken Ferris)

If you plan to vote by mail, you have to apply. Election authorities must receive the application for a mail-in ballot by Oct. 29.
 The Postal Service recommended that Illinois voters wanting to cast a ballot by mail submit their applications “at least 15 days before Election Day at a minimum, and preferably long before that time.”
 Election authorities will start sending mail-in ballots to approved applicants on Thursday. Once you’ve filled out the ballot, you can return it through the Postal Service or licensed couriers, or bring it to the election board that has jurisdiction over your area.
 The ballot must be received within 14 days after Election Day. They also must be postmarked by Election Day, meaning any ballot sent through the mail after Nov. 3 will not be counted.
 Before casting your ballot by mail, make sure you sign your return envelope and ballot wherever indicated.
 Election boards provide various ways for voters to track their ballot.

This column is reprinted with permission from Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen. It originally ran in The Boston Globe on Sept. 27, 2016.
 It all started last May, over a plate of fried clams at a restaurant in the Back Bay.      John Butterworth and Steve Gaziano had taken Travis Roy out for dinner, just to catch up. Butterworth and Gaziano are hockey guys, and if there is one group of people who have never forgotten Travis Roy, it's hockey guys.      Twenty-one years ago, Travis Roy was 11 seconds into his first shift for Boston University when he went down along the boards and couldn't get up. He was 20 years old, a quadriplegic. He has spent the last two decades giving comfort to those who have suffered similar fates, raising millions for research, providing wheelchairs and other hardware to those who need to adapt after a catastrophic injury.
 That night over fried clams, the three men got to talking about what they wanted to do during the summer.
 "What I would really like to do," Travis Roy said, "and what I haven't been able to do since I got injured, is go fishing, on the ocean."
 Butterworth and Gaziano looked at each other and immediately thought the same thing: Carl Cavossa.      Cavossa, Butterworth, and Gaziano have been fishing together out of Falmouth for a quarter-century. They don't have to be asked twice to go fishing.      "We'll go fishing off the Vineyard on Carl's boat," Butterworth said, and Gaziano nodded. Done deal.      Travis Roy appreciated what Gaziano and Butterworth were proposing, but he didn't believe for a minute they'd be able to get him on a small fishing boat. There was that little matter of him being attached to a 600-pound motorized wheelchair.      But Gaziano and Butterworth knew if anybody could figure it out, it's Carl Cavossa.      Cavossa's business is disposal and excavating. He has the brain of an engineer and the brawn of a wrestler. He asked Roy to send him the wheelchair's dimensions. Then he welded together a metal cage, the size of a witness box. Roy steered his wheelchair into the cage, and Cavossa used an old Army surplus crane to lift and lower him and the wheelchair onto the back of his boat, the Play Penn.      Getting Travis Roy onto the boat didn't turn out to be the problem. Finding bait was the problem. There was a dearth of pogies. Nobody on the Cape had pogies. Cavossa explained to a couple of fishermen he needed pogies because he was bringing Travis Roy fishing.      "You mean that kid from BU?" a fisherman who goes by the nickname Hairball asked.      Cavossa nodded.      Hairball found 50 pogies in no time. When Cavossa tried to pay Hairball, he wouldn't take the money. The word went out among fishermen all around Falmouth and soon Cavossa had 100 pogies. No one would take Cavossa's money.      At the fuel dock, the guy pumping gas asked Cavossa if he could talk to Travis. The guy explained that his friend's son had been paralyzed in an accident two weeks before. The guy huddled with Travis, who promised to help.      Roy's father, Lee, came onboard, as did Butterworth's 10-year-old son Jack, Gaziano's 11-year-old son Joe, and Cavossa's sons, Nick, 15, and Sam, 14.      The boat was cruising near the Elizabeth Islands, north of Martha's Vineyard, when Cavossa looked down from the captain's chair to see Sam lifting a bottle to Travis Roy's lips so he could drink some water. Nick broke up a chocolate chip cookie so Travis could eat it more easily.
 Steve Gaziano had volunteered to be the chum man. He cut the pogies into bits, dropping them off the back of the boat to attract the fish. The kids clamored for jelly doughnuts, the slang for the gooey midsection of a pogie.      "Jelly doughnuts are the best bait," Jack Butterworth confided to Travis.      "I believe you," Travis replied.      But the jelly doughnuts weren't working. Cavossa moved the boat around, like a dog sniffing for something.      "I've got an idea," he yelled down from the captain's chair.      As the boat sped toward the Vineyard, bits of surf flew onboard, like pelting rain drops. The boys and Lee Roy took turns drying off Travis's glasses. Cavossa stopped just west of Nomans Land, an uninhabited island off the Vineyard.      The stripers began striking immediately. With rapid succession, the kids pulled in stripers and black bass, one after another. Jack Butterworth landed a beauty, a 36-inch striper. He got it off the hook, then brought it over so Travis could feel the scales on his cheek.      Lee Roy landed a huge black bass and proudly showed it to his son.      Back at the dock, it took Cavossa two hours to fillet all the fish. The Roys headed back up to Vermont with enough fish to feed an army.      The next day, Travis Roy sent Carl Cavossa a note.      "I grew up in Maine," he wrote, "in a town close to the ocean. We didn't have a boat, but on occasions when I would get on a friend's boat and out on the ocean, it was always awesome. I obviously can't feel, can't move, can't do much of anything. But I can take in a moment or an experience in life like not many people can.
 "Sitting in the back of the boat watching the rooster tail and the spray of the ocean is magical,'' Roy wrote. "It reminds me of sitting next to a campfire. I can watch the flames and embers of a fire for hours. Seeing the colors and clarity of the ocean as the wake forms and then dissipates is exhilarating.''      "Having my glasses covered with ocean spray was unexpected, one of those little things that you forget about when you haven't been on the ocean for 20 years. Just licking the salt off my lips was a treat, a sensation, a taste I had forgotten about."      But that wasn't Travis Roy's favorite part of the fishing trip.      "I'm afraid it's probably not in the cards for me to have a son, but I've got the best dad in the world. The bonding that went on yesterday between father and son was special. I loved seeing each of you interact with your sons. Nature has filled your kids with your DNA, but it is your nurturing that fills their souls. Yesterday was one of those moments that will forever be ingrained in your kids, whether they realize it or not."      Travis Roy told me that the fishing trip was a microcosm of his life since Oct. 20, 1995, when he lost so much on the ice.      His family, his friends, have given him opportunities that so many others never get.      "I have benefited from the kindness of complete strangers for the past 20 years," he said. "No, this isn't the life that I wanted to live. But at the same time, I am very aware of how fortunate I am. We all have our challenges. It's important to sit back and count your blessings, too."

 I think that's the message everybody should be sending right now, which is that don't wait until Election Day if you're going to vote in-person. If you can vote in-person early, please do so. If you're going to vote by mail, make sure you send it in immediately, so that you don't -- are not victim to, say, difficulties with the Postal Service delivering your ballot.
 Also, in some states, you can track your ballot. So there's ballot tracking software that states have made available to see whether your vote has been received. And then, if there are mistakes in your ballot, if you live in one of those states where it gives you an opportunity to correct those mistakes, make sure to avail yourself of that.
 But the key thing is to read the instructions on the ballot and to mail it in early.

The two launched PwD Japan in September 2019. More than 200 Amazon employees attended the event to celebrate its launch. According to Umezawa and Obata, PwD Japan now has more than 300 members.
 “We noticed a demand for a PwD chapter in Japan. There were a lot of people who wanted to support it,” said Obata. “This support for the chapter came from peers and senior leaders.”
 The group started out holding learning sessions and lectures on disabilities for employees in Japan. Prior to the pandemic, they also had a casual, monthly luncheon for group members. In light of physical distancing guidelines, they’ve swapped the in-person lunches for virtual coffee hours.
 “Our current goal is to provide a safe place for employees with disabilities during these tough times,” said Obata.
 Next up, Umezawa, Obata, and their fellow PwD Japan leaders plan to launch a community tool as well as a book club to continue to connect Amazon employees with disabilities and allies in Japan.
 “We’ve been happy to hear from people who find the affinity group to be a safe place to discuss disabilities,” said Obata. “Our affinity group is still quite young, and we have a lot of opportunity for growth.”
 National Disability Employment Awareness Month is a time to highlight conversations about accessibility, inclusion, and opportunities for people with disabilities in the workplace. However, the work must be ongoing to spark positive change. Through continued awareness in our communities and workplaces, we can raise the bar on accessibility and inclusion.
