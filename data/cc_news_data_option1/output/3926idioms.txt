But the SUBPAC eMHP never presented a plan to Romero and his command regarding his mental health treatment, a misstep investigators ascribed to the clinic interpreting a Defense Department patient confidentiality provision too broadly.
 The lack of communication extended to the boat as well, resulting in several missed chances to remove Romero from armed watch standing.
 Clinic officials admitted that a manning shortage at the facility likely impeded the ability for everyone to get on the same page, as the billets for a clinical psychologist and senior corpsman remained unfilled at the time.

NIZA. Sobre un terreno de gravilla frente las aguas turquesas del mar Mediterráneo, Jean-Claude Calcagno se prepara para una ronda de petanca, la versión francesa del juego de bolos y el deporte favorito de los jubilados.
 Su club situado en el área de Niza de la costa francesa normalmente está repleto de gente, pero Calcagno dice que muchos de sus miembros prefirieron quedarse en casa, espantados por la reaparición de brotes del virus.
 ▶️ Mantente informado en nuestro canal de Google Noticias
 "Están un poco renuentes", dijo Calcagno sobre sus compañeros, la mayoría de ellos ancianos. "Si siguen teniendo dudas, no vendrán", añadió.
 Tras una disminución de los casos en el verano boreal, la pandemia de coronavirus está ganando terreno nuevamente en muchas partes de Europa y este sector del sur de Francia es un punto de riesgo.
 El Gobierno francés designó a la región alrededor de Niza como una zona de alerta. Los bares y restaurantes deben cerrar a las 10 de la noche y no se permiten reuniones de más de 10 personas en un mismo lugar en específico.
 El sector también tiene una concentración inusual de jubilados.
 Las personas con más de 60 años componen 29.6 por ciento de la población de Niza, de acuerdo a la agencia de estadísticas estatal, en comparación con 20.5 por ciento de nivel nacional.
 A los retirados les atrae el buen tiempo durante gran parte del año y las recreaciones y servicios para personas mayores. En el club de petanca pueden verse una tienda de equipos de apoyo auditivo y la consulta de un cardiólogo en un radio de 200 metros de distancia.
 Pero la combinación de casos más agudos de coronavirus y una población importante de adultos mayores ha hecho que muchos jubilados de la ciudad se muestren temerosos.

Afterwards, the Switchbacks took an extended lap around the field to thank the limited crowd for its support over the years.
 “It’s crazy how many of them I know by name. Just appreciative of them supporting us through all the ups and downs. This is a special place,” said Burt, the only man with the team for all six seasons in the club’s history.
 “The fans make it special, so thank you to the fans.”
 The hope is some of the existing fans will be joined by new fans for an even better gameday experience downtown, signaling another mixture of the past, present and future.
 “We’re building. We’re gaining momentum and we’re heading in the right direction,” Koch said.
 The new downtown stadium sits about 20 minutes southwest of Weidner Field, and it’s not the only part of the club hopefully becoming more attractive.
 “We will fight, of course, and we will maintain that identity. That’s part of who the Switchbacks are, but we’re here to play some good football,” Koch said. “We’re trying to build, we’re trying to possess, we’re trying to create. That’s what is going to take us into the new stadium and allow us to have success, but you don’t change your identity overnight. It takes time.
 "We’re definitely still growing, but you can see it. There’s been some beautiful football that we played during the course of the season. We want to have longer moments of that beautiful football, but we’ll get there. It will just take us a little bit of time.”

But the main distinction with The Botanist is in the 22 foraged botanicals that are infused into the gin after the first distillation. These wild botanicals are all harvested by professional foragers around the island between the spring and fall.

If that’s not bad enough, hunters also need to worry about their companion hunters or even complete strangers putting holes in their hide by mistake. Ostensibly that’s the reason for wearing blaze orange, but many suspect, as do I, that the real reason for that regulation is to make it easier for game wardens to spot hunters afield and keep an eye on them. Regardless of how it makes you feel, some folks just need constant monitoring. As a result of a few individuals’ errant behavior, all of us have to pay the piper.
 As far as active hunting dangers go, there are even the animals themselves. There are big bears and their smaller cousins, the black bears, some of which kill folks to eat them rather than just to mess with them a bit. There are bull moose and even more dangerous mama moose with kinder, starving cougars and socially emboldened wolves, venomous reptiles, outhouse spiders and ticked-off hordes of hornets. Even the gentle wildlife creatures we bump into while out wandering through the woods can flat get your knickers in a twist if pressed hard enough, even ordinarily innocuous prey animals.
 Every year there are numerous reports about buck deer, usually whitetails but occasionally mule deer bucks, even mountain goat billies, that have turned the tables on their human antagonists and slain them. While the bucks have their obviously dangerous antlers to defend their lives with, those usually pale in comparison with the slashing hooves of an enraged or badly frightened female of the species fighting for its life or defending its young. They can slice you up like a waterfront mugger.
 All too often certain naive people retain as adults the concepts of wildlife innocence we observed as children and learned from being brainwashed by early Disney wildlife films and cartoons depicting all wildlife as carefree, innocent, frolicking, flower-children types. Understand one thing: all wild animals can be lethal and, at all times, should be respected. Even the lowly rabbits and hares. Give them their space.
 Even more importantly, never take the prey animals lightly. Just this year, elk hunter Mark David of Hillsboro, Ore., was killed by a bull elk he’d been hunting. The previous day he’d put an arrow in the big guy but lost it when it turned dark while he was tracking it. The next day Mark and the gent on whose land he was hunting went back out after it. When they found the wounded bull, Mark placed another arrow in it.
 Instead of running away, the behemoth charged his persecutor and fatally gored him with its outsized antlers. The elk was later tracked down and killed, but this incident underscores the importance of respecting wild critters. Especially wounded ones. Approach wounded critters very carefully and be prepared for anything. Also, make certain the critter is dead before you start to handle it. An awful lot of “dead” critters weren’t. It doesn’t have to be a grizzly to tear you a new one, especially when wounded.

It is with profound sadness and heavy hearts we share the sudden passing of our beloved husband and father, Richard Alvin Ross Ennest on Sunday, September 20th, 2020 at the age of 59 (one week short of his 60th Birthday). Richard lived life to the fullest and was a kind-hearted man. Due to a tragic accident, Richard was taken from us too soon. Richard will be lovingly remembered by his wife Carrie (Carolyn) of 18 years (together for 24 years,) and his three sons, Ethan (16), Mathew (14) and Brenden (10). Richard will always be remembered by his brothers, Bob (Cindy) Ennest, Scott Ennest and Jon (Kelly) Ennest. He is predeceased by his father Stanley (June 3rd, 1987), mother Gayle (January 9th, 2011) and sister Dianne Howard (May 14th, 1993). Richard will be greatly missed by his mother in-law Susan Copeland, his sister in-law Christine (Doug) Woods, Bill (Christine) Copeland, Michael (Mandy) Copeland. Predeceased by his father in-law Dave Copeland (Feb.8, 2008). Richard will also be forever remembered by numerous nieces, nephews, great-nieces and nephews and dear friends. Richard was a Past Master of King Edward VII #471 (1995), Past Grand Lodge Officer, Grand Standard Bearer (2014), 32 Degree Scottish Right Mason, Niagara Valley. Richard was a proud and devoted father to his three boys. He enjoyed attending their extra curricular activities such as hockey, basketball and drum recitals. Together they took bike rides to the local Easterbrook's hot dog stand for ice-cream. Richard enjoyed many activities such as golfing with his wife and kids; he always had his family closest to his heart. Over the last two years, Rich also renewed his interest in racing his corvette at TMP in Cayuga. Rich loved going to sporting events, concerts as well as his down time on the couch watching sports, history channel and Netflix. Richard always had a passion for cars, especially corvettes. He was a business owner and operator as well as a talented transmission mechanic at Mr. Transmission on Plains Rd (20 years) then Fairview St. (10 years) in Burlington. Rich is remembered by his employees as a great boss and friend. He will be greatly missed by his long- time employees and colleagues in the industry. Richard loved spending time with family and friends. Richard enjoyed his annual camping trips to Grundy Provincial Park with family and friends. He was an avid pool player, a member of CPA for over 25 years. Richard and Carrie enjoyed playing in their Tuesday night pool league at Jerseys in Burlington. Richard had a great taste for fine wine and dining. He could always recommend a restaurant, a great wine and dish to anyone that was asking. He also enjoyed barbequing and cooking. The Ennest family would like to extend a special thank you to the Hamilton General Hospital East ICU team, Doctors and Nurses, Trillium Team, Paramedics, Police Officers, Hagersville Hospital Emergency and all who helped Richard to get the care he needed at TMP. Thank you to everyone for your out pouring of love, concern and support during this difficult time. Cremation has taken place, along with a visitation on Monday, September 28 and private family service on Tuesday, September 29. Celebration of life will be planned at a later date due to COVID restrictions.

The plane has been prohibited from flying since March of 2019, after a 737 Max operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed shortly after takeoff from the airport in Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board. That was the second 737 Max to crash in less than five months; the first crash happened in Indonesia on Oct. 27, 2018, killing 189 people.
 Both crashes were caused in part by a flawed automated flight control system, called MCAS, that was activated by faulty data from a single sensor, and repeatedly forced the planes into nose dives as the pilots struggled to regain control.
 FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines pilot, sat at the controls of a 737 Max and flew it through a number of different scenarios to test how the plane handled in crisis situations and to evaluate Boeing's revisions to the flight control system.
 "I completed a number of test profiles today to examine the functionality of the aircraft and I liked what I saw, so it responded well," Dickson told reporters in a news conference after the flight. "I did two landings and also some air work maneuvers over about a two hour period... and I felt prepared. I think most importantly, I felt that the training prepared me to be very comfortable."

Investors in Japan and elsewhere were left scratching their heads Thursday after trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world’s third largest by market value, was halted for the day due to a technical failure.
 The Tokyo Stock Exchange said it was working to restore trading by Friday and would hold a news conference later in the day. There was no indication that the outage resulted from hacking or other cybersecurity breaches.
 The Japan Exchange Group issued a statement saying that a hardware failure caused a malfunction in the backup device meant to kick in if there was a technical problem.
 As a result, “market information could not be distributed,” it said.

Historical studies indicate that the economy typically grows at faster rates under Democratic presidents. The difference is not large, but it is statistically significant. Drawing any conclusions from the data is, at best, a complex undertaking. Most policy changes involve lag times, and current performance can be due to actions taken during prior administrations. Some presidents inherit structural problems, and others implement policies that only bear fruit down the road. It’s possible to stimulate the economy in the short term but cause long-term harm. (I have been around long enough to witness all of these things.) The bottom line is that trying to give a president substantial credit or blame for the economy is almost always oversimplifying.

The price of domestic natural gas for the second half of the financial year 2020-21 is cut by 25.1 percent to $1.79 per MMBTU as against the earlier price of $2.39 per MMBTU. The ceiling price for deepwater natural gas is set at $4.06 per MMBTU for the period starting October 1 until March 31, which was earlier at $5.61 per MMBTU. The sharp cut in the domestic natural gas price comes on the back of a cut in global prices, also impacted due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has lowered demand while production is higher. The impact of the price cut will be on companies like ONGC and Oil India which are into exploration and production of 80 percent of domestically produced natural gas in India. The move will impact both realisation and profitability of the companies, as crude prices have not recovered from their lows. More here

Richard enjoyed many activities such as golfing with his wife and kids; he always had his family closest to his heart. Over the last two years, Rich also renewed his interest in racing his corvette at TMP in Cayuga.

The Huskies’ D tightened up and forced the Longhorns to give the ball back. The Huskies botched a snap and Abarr dove on top of it, giving the Longhorns a new possession. Two long third-down conversions later, Meeteetse scored again and went up 14-8 in the first quarter.
 Burlington’s offense came back and marched down the field again, but an errant pass by sophomore QB Cohen Schlenker got tipped into the air, right into Bennett’s waiting arms. The Longhorns drove down the field again and put more points on the board, now up 20-8.
 On the next drive, Gotfredson put the team on his back and carried Meeteetse defenders down to the goal line. The Huskies punched it into the end zone in around a minute and added two more points, bringing them within four, 20-16.
 Needing a cushion going into the half, Bennett started the next drive with a pass that was picked off and taken to the house. The Huskies now had the advantage, 24-20.
 The Huskies D forced Meeteetse to turn it over on downs the next possession. Although the Huskies completed their first pass of the drive, it turned into a fumble and the Longhorns got the ball back with decent field position.
 Abarr ran hard to the outside and got hit low. He sat out the remainder of the game. Now without their senior leader, Bennett took it himself on the next play and gave the Longhorns the lead back 28-24.
 Burlington tried to shake off the chunk play, but penalties pushed them farther and farther back. On their own five, the Huskies bobbled another snap and the ball went into the endzone. They recovered it, but were down on the grass, giving the Longhorns a safety and a 6-point lead to end the half.
 The Huskies defense adjusted to the run-pass option that had gashed them the entire first half, and clawed their way back into the game. Bennett shook off strong pressure and sliced between two defenders for a score late in the third to put the Longhorns on top, 38-24.
 Down 14, the Huskies top rusher, senior Gideon George, pushed through the Longhorns defense. Early in the fourth, George found a seam and ran it 61 yards for a score to bring the Huskies within six.
 Bennett went down with some leg cramps in the following minutes. George capitalized on his absence, taking the ball for another long gain. Junior Kalvin Erickson saved the touchdown on a shoestring tackle. It wouldn’t matter. Two plays later, George punched it in. The defense did its job and saved two more points from the conversion from going on the board to set up the final winning drive.
 The Longhorns travel to Encampment (2-1, 1-1 conference) on Saturday to face the No. 2 Tigers in a battle for the 6-Man West. Kickoff is at 3 p.m.

The crunch that came from concerns about the Coronavirus has put quite a strain on businesses this summer. State and county budgets have been effected by the loss of events such as the Fall Festival and Montross First Fridays, and the revenue they bring with them. Fortunately, some additional CARES Act funding has come the county’s way. Counties around the state got another round of funding.
 Westmoreland County was granted additional funds to the tune of $1.571,739, and got to keep $1,224,699.04, while Colonial Beach was sent $313,090.40 of the funds. Montross’ portion, meanwhile, was to the tune of $33,949.56, as the money was apportioned by population. According to the resolution that the Montross Town Council unanimously passed at last week’s meeting, “the county has to certify that these funds are only spent for expenses incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to the Coronavirus Disease, that they were not accounted for in the most recent budget approved as of March 27, 2020 and that they were incurred during the period beginning on March 1, 2020 and ending on December 30, 2020.”
 After the resolution passed, it now became a question of how they were going to spend it. According to Town Manager Patricia Lewis, $364 had already been used on supplies such as hand sanitizer, face masks, gloves, and so on, with additional orders on the way. Lewis also held a meeting with Westmoreland County Administrator Norm Risavi earlier in the month to discuss the matter.
 “We were trying to figure out ways to spend it,” she explained, “so I asked him if the CARES Act would cover a new Ipad and laptop, as I had been using my own ones to livestream our meetings. According to Risavi, it’d cover those as an expense, especially since I’m guessing we’ll keep doing this with our meetings long after this is over.
 “He also explained that we can be reimbursed for the time spent for cleaning, along with the time I’ve spent on meetings, webinars, and any other kind of paperwork.”
 That still leaves a fair bit of money to use though, and while 33 grand is not a lot of money, every little bit helps. To that end, Lewis proposed putting the rest into a grant fund to help the businesses in the town.
 “I really want to help the businesses,” she continued. “It’s not a lot of money that we can give them, but I just feel we need to do that.”
 This proposal would set up a three-man “grant panel,” consisting of someone from the Montross Town Council, another from the Montross Planning Commission, and Lewis. The grants would be around $1,500 each on a first come, first served basis.”
 According to Lewis, this would, depending on how many businesses applied, likely use up all or almost all of the CARES funds the town has been given, which is just as well since it operates on a “use it or lose it” basis. It did not take long to approve the creation of the committee afterwards. How many businesses apply in the end is yet to be seen.

There is no way that two people would use the exact same phrasing unless it had been provided to them in advance.
 They both went on to attack Bohen’s character. Prunty called him a bully. Cox called him an angry man. This is especially amusing in light of their multiple Explorer letters and social media posts where they engage in bullying and name-calling to the point that Cox has been banned from two social media blogs. And let’s not forget the town council videos revealing Councilmember Solomon’s multiple angry outbursts.
 So why are Prunty and Cox just fine with Solomon’s toxic behavior? It’s because Cox and Solomon are both pro-development and Solomon has fought to protect Prunty’s golf course views at the expense of Oro Valley taxpayers.
 Perhaps next time, Prunty and Cox will be smart enough to coordinate their letters so that they don’t end up looking so foolish.
