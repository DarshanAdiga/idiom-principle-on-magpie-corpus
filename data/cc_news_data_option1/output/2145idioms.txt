Mi sono avvicinata per effettuare delle riprese di quanto stava accadendo e la polizia ha subito cominciato a sparare quella che mi è sembrata essere una combinazione di granate stordenti e proiettili di gomma. Ci hanno tirato addosso anche dei gas lacrimogeni, e così abbiamo tutti iniziato a tossire", è stata la testimonianza della giornalista.

 Di Maio, ecco la lettera su Libia e Medio Oriente: "L'Italia ha ancora molto da dire"
 Per capire l’esigenza di Tripoli e l’opportunità di un’Italia quasi completamente estromessa dai giochi libici bisogna considerare lo scenario apertosi lo scorso 18 maggio con la caduta di Watiya, la base aerea da cui le forze di Haftar coordinavano gli assalti alla capitale. Quella sconfitta segnala fine del generale e del suo sogno di conquistare Tripoli. Ma a decidere la ritirata del generale non sono soltanto i missili, i droni e i mercenari di Erdogan. A favorire quella“debacle” contribuisce soprattutto la volontà del Cremlino di ottenere il cessate il fuoco, deciso a gennaio a Berlino, per poi aprire un negoziato tra la Tripolitania di Serraj e una Cirenaica rappresentata non più dal generale Haftar, ma dal politico Aguila Saleh Issa, presidente del parlamento in esilio a Tobruk. Una decisione a cui, grazie alle pressioni del Cremlino, si accodano anche Egitto ed Emirati Arabi ovvero i due più irriducibili alleati del generale, veri mandanti dell’assalto a Tripoli lanciato nell’aprile di un anno fa. Un tweet diffuso all’indomani della caduta di Waitya da Anwar Gargash, ministro degli esteri degli Emirati,spiega infatti che “l’unica via d’uscita dalla crisi libica è un immediato e totale cessate il fuoco e un ritorno al processo politico” aggiungendo che il paese non avrà futuro se i combattenti “continueranno a non aver altro obiettivo se non qualche vittoria tattica”. Messo da parte l’uomo forte della Cirenaica Mosca deve però arginare anche l’aggressività turca. L’arrivo dalla Siria di 12 caccia Mig 29 e due Sukhoi SU 24 serve proprio a scoraggiare un’ offensiva delle milizie di Serraj suggerita o incoraggiato da Ankara. L’arrivo di quella flotta aerea riaccende però l’attenzione di Washington preoccupata sia dalla presenza degli aerei,sia dal ruolo di una Russia pronta a diventare, assieme ad Ankara, il vero ago della bilancia degli assetti politici libici.

Showers remain in the forecast for later today, but the timing will be a little later than it looked Monday. So, most of the day will stay dry under a cloudy sky with showers developing later tonight, pushing through overnight. Highs today will once again top out mainly in the 60s, this time due to the clouds. It won't be as cool overnight with lows mainly in the 50s, a few upper 40s in the Adirondacks Mountains.

“To me it sounds like wearing a mask in a shop,” said Hubert, 24. “It’s easy and it can help protecting others.”
 The various European apps use low-energy Bluetooth signals to anonymously log the nearby presence of other users. Under the French system, data is uploaded to government-run centralized servers. Users who test positive will be able to notify others who have been in close contact for at least 15 minutes so they can self-isolate and seek treatment.
 France, like Britain, rejected a new mobile software interface for tracing apps jointly developed by U.S. tech giants Google and Apple, instead choosing to build its own. The Google-Apple system uses a “decentralized” system backed by privacy experts because it keeps data on phones, but British and French officials say it doesn't give them enough information to manage outbreaks.
 Civil liberties groups worry that tracing apps are a gateway to government surveillance but Cedric O, France's junior minister for the digital economy, dismissed those concerns.
 “The problem with a centralized protocol is that you have to be confident and to trust your state but we’re in a democratic state, we have checks and balances,” O told the AP.
 The government says the app doesn’t track location and deletes user data after 14 days.

DXY remains unable to gather serious traction. US civil unrest stays in the limelight so far on Tuesday. API's weekly report on US crude oil supplies coming up next. The greenback, in terms of the US Dollar Index (DXY), keeps trading on the defensive although it has so far managed to put some distance from earlier multi-week lows in the 97.45/40 band. US Dollar Index weaker on risk-on mood The index has accelerated the leg lower on Tuesday, briefly testing the vicinity of 97.40 - or 3-month lows - and always against the backdrop of the unremitting preference for riskier assets. Also weighing on the sentiment surrounding the buck, investors keep scrutinizing the developments in many US cities in light of the recent violent protests and particularly following President Trump's threat to send in the military. Nothing scheduled in the calendar other than the usual weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute (API) on US crude oil inventories due later in the NA session. Moving forward, results from the US labour market are expected to grab all the attention following the ADP report (Wednesday), Initial Claims (Thursday) and Non-farm Payrolls (Friday). What to look for around USD The greenback remains under heavy pressure at the beginning of the month, threatening to extend the downtrend well below the 98.00 mark against the backdrop of firm risk-on sentiment. In the meantime, the dollar remains vigilant on the US-China trade front, the gradual return to some sort of normality in the US economy and the broader risk appetite trends as main drivers of the price action. On the constructive stance around the buck, bouts of risk aversion should support the investors' preference for the greenback as a safe haven along with its status of global reserve currency and store of value. US Dollar Index relevant levels At the moment, the index is losing 0.21% at 97.61 and faces initial support at 97.43 (monthly low Jun.2) followed by 97.35 (low Jan.31) and then 97.11 (monthly low Nov.1 2019). On the upside, a break above 98.50 (200-day SMA) would aim for 99.04 (100-day SMA) and finally 99.98 (high May 25).

When it became clear that Sweden could not escape the growing pandemic, the main topic on everyone’s lips was the preparedness of the healthcare system and the lack of emergency stocks. Sweden entered the crisis as one of the countries with the least critical care bed numbers per capita in Europe. Following the end of the Cold War, dramatic cuts were made to civil defence contingencies. For example, in 1993 Sweden had access to a total of 4,300 critical care beds with respirators, by 2018 the total number was down to 574. Today all parties from left to right are united in rejecting these policies, arguing that it was naïve to leave Swedish society in such a vulnerable position in times of crisis.

Tuesday could be the day that Joe Biden is crowned the official Democratic presidential nominee. There are 479 delegates up for grabs as Indiana (82), Maryland (96), Montana (19), New Mexico (34), Pennsylvania (186), Rhode Island (26), South Dakota (16), and the District of Columbia (20) hold Democratic presidential primaries, reports the _Atlanta Journal Constitution_. With 1,566 pledged delegates, Biden needs just 425 to take the majority at 1,991. But while the 77-year-old is the only remaining candidate in the field, voters can opt to write another name on their ballots. President Trump attacked Biden on the eve of the vote, saying he was "clueless" to a strategy in which campaign officials were working "to get the Anarchists out of jail." "They will be the real power, not Joe. They will be calling the shots! Big tax increases for all," the president tweeted.
