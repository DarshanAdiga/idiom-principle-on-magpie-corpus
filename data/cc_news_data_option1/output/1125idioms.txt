Quill: The Alexa Mini and K35 zoom combo was a decision we made essentially the moment I was hired. Bobby really loved the style of a music video I had shot with Jay (our lead actor) where I first experimented with this camera/lens combo. We loved the zoom for all its quirkiness and also needed the flexibility it brought to our insane shooting schedule. We decided to fill out the kit with a few K35 primes for our more intimate tracking shots and scenes in tight spaces. We wanted to bring the tongue in cheek, "gonzo" style that Hunter was famous for to the look of the film, so the motorized zoom was key to adding some charm. With that same spirit in mind, we chose to cover a lot of the film on Super 8, mixing formats to bring in more documentary feeling segments and help bring the time period to life.

Who knew a TV show could make you remember how it felt to fall in love for the first time? Those confusing butterflies, ignited by a single moment of eye contact, sending you into a tailspin of raging hormones and insecurities? Okay, maybe that doesn't sound so great, but in Laurie Nunn's charming and progressive high school-set series, it's downright revelatory. "Sex Education" follows a teenage boy doling out sex therapy to his classmates for a modest fee, aided by his unrequited (or maybe not?) crush. His precocious amounts of intuition and empathy he no doubt learned from his therapist mother, who is played within an inch of her life by an impeccably dressed Gillian Anderson. The show addresses relevant sexual and mental health issues in a fun and honest way most teenagers are not getting at home or at school. More than that, it's wildly entertaining, stunning to look at, and brimming with heart. —Jude Dry

“Better Call Saul” has always been one of television’s most consistently excellent shows and Season 5 has been no different. The show’s contemplative and rare explosive moments are equally engaging, no matter if they’re about Kim Wexler’s mounting moral dilemmas, the Mexican cartel maneuverings that harken back to “Breaking Bad,” or Jimmy McGill’s latest outrageous (and legally dubious) stunt. “Better Call Saul” is a quieter, more slow-paced series than most of television’s heavy hitters and it’s a testament to the show’s impeccable writers that “Better Call Saul” manages to be so reliably entertaining despite the grim realities viewers know most of its characters are inevitability spiraling towards. —Tyler Hersko

I was very lucky to have the best lighting crew in Florida, headed by Jim Pescrelli. Everything was controlled wirelessly so we could tweak on the fly. His rigging crew was essential to staying on schedule, allowing us to shoot quickly after John arrived on set. We used mostly LED’s inside, various types from titans to skypanels. For larger setups we used maxi brutes outside instead of traditional HMI’s. I wanted a narrative arc to the lighting, moving from underlit, institutional, and cloudy to sun blazing into the rooms when the heroes find inspiration. The lighting feels natural to keep you in the story, and is dramatic when needed.

"The thing was that even though on some level it felt like gobbledegook as I was reading it, because you got the sense that things were all over the place, what I really got and what was really clear was the emotional journey of the character," Pearce says. "As the actor that's the only thing I need to latch onto in order to do my job. The other stuff began to make sense the more as I worked with Chris Nolan and rehearsed with him. Once it all made sense to me, I then had to put it all away and let it all go and just treat every scene as its own little thing because I wasn't supposed to remember what had happened before and obviously had no clue what was coming afterwards."

Paolo Sorrentino's return to the Vatican didn't exactly take the easy path to glory. Not only was the Young Pope (Jude Law) relegated to supporting duty, but the eponymous New Pope was a melancholy, fragile, old Englishman — the very opposite of his predecessor, and thus no longer custom-made to set the internet ablaze. And yet Sorrentino, who wrote and directed every episode, finds exciting new eccentricities for John Malkovich's lead character, including a penchant for outlandish fashion choices and a vain fascination with celebrities. (He's Meghan Markle's go-to fashion advisor and holds meeting with Marilyn Manson and Sharon Stone in the Vatican.) There's also a great deal of empathy to be shared with Sir John Brannix, whose focus on helping the weak stems from his own perceived delicacy, making for an ideal spiritual counter to Lenny Belardo's Old Testament papacy. By the time Law's pope returns, Sorrentino has established equal footing between the two men, making for an enticing and enlightening meeting of the pious minds. Yes, "The New Pope" is built on the back of "The Young Pope," and Law's presence — as well as Sorrentino's well-established sense of humor — help elevate the follow-up season for devout viewers. But how well this fresh entry stands on its own merits makes it all the more worthy of praise. —Ben Travers

Given these circumstances, this is why many are asking if the Academy might consider changing its rules. For example, if Focus took "Never Rarely Sometimes Always" to VOD — like its Oscar-eligible "Emma" — would the Academy allow the abortion drama in light of the theater closings? Could the Academy consider films that opened on VOD eligible for Oscars, since theaters were forced to be closed? Would the Academy push back the Oscars (again!) to allow delayed films a chance to catch up?
