The Dodgers’ 15-3 win was a decisive departure from anything the Braves saw in Game 1 and for most of Game 2. If they are able to turn the tables in the series, it will be because they started doing something Seager has been doing all season. The straw that stirred the drink was not their leadoff hitter, but their slugging shortstop.

The report, called “The State of Childhood Obesity: Prioritizing Children’s Health During the Pandemic,” shows Iowa improved on the national rankings, falling from 14th a year ago to 22nd this year, even though the percentage of obese youth in Iowa dropped only slightly. “We see incredible signs of progress but there’s certainly a long, long way to go,” Bussel says. “I don’t think anybody who’s been in the field of childhood obesity prevention for a long time feels totally satisfied with where we’re at.”

"When you wake up in the morning and come to school, attack the classroom like that's the last time you'll ever be in the classroom," Kevin Hoffman said. "When you come out on the practice field, attack the practice like that may be your last practice, and then obviously in a game, play the game as hard as you can play it, and understand that accidents are gonna happen. If you play the game long enough, it's not if you get injured, but it's when you get injured. You know that's an unfortunate injury for Dak Prescott, I think the world of him, I think he's a great role model for our kids, I wish the best for him and the Dallas Cowboys, but that's something that you'll never know, when your last play could be."

HINGHAM - The starting roster might look significantly different that it did last year, but the winning nature of the Hingham High boys golf team remains steadfastly familiar.
 This year's varsity team picked right up where it left off by driving out to a 7-0 start this season, despite losing five seniors from last year's epic undefeated championship team.
 "Losing last year's starting seniors Shan Syed, Cooper Pennell, Hunter Ruddick and Wes Bevins - who each averaged around 38 - put a big dent in our team," admitted Head Coach Dan Clune. Fortunately, Clune added, the remaining golfers that form the foundation of the 2020 squad "are not too shabby."
 Junior captain Luke Macdonald averaged 37 last year and moves into the number one slot this year and senior captain Jake "Pounder" Wilson moves up right next to him after an outstanding 2019 season.
 The leadership from the two captains is palpable and brings great balance and harmony to the team. Clune describes Wilson as "the chemistry guy, always bringing the team together with his lighthearted manner both on and off the golf course." Macdonald, who has played varsity since freshman year, "leads by example and shows players the right way to get things done just by the way he carries himself," praises Clune. "They are an outstanding duo to build a team around."
 Returning from last season's varsity team, and expected to contribute heavily this year, are senior John Sherwood, juniors Alex Bankhead and Teddy von der Luft as well as sophomore Victor San Antonio.
 There was a deep pool of talent to draw from to fill the rest of the voids on the varsity roster. JV Coach Eric Gill has sixteen players and two junior varsity teams that went undefeated last year. Getting the call up to varsity this year were Jake Bednarski, Bobby Pierce, Dom Kanter, Gus Strachan, Jack Barclay and Ryan Bordeau.
 Moreover, out of a record large field of 55 freshmen that tried out this year, Clune has high expectations for notable new varsity players Carson Erick and James Flynn.
 Although the season started late and will end early without any state tournament due to the pandemic, the team still has lofty goals.
 "We have won the Patriot League title for the past three years in a row, and I think it's a realistic goal again this season with this talented group of players," Clune said.
 Macdonald doesn't hold back in acknowledging that he has "eyes on an undefeated season." By all accounts so far for this 7-0 team, Macdonald's expectations for this season are on par.

There is a view amongst some – not, perhaps, amongst those necessarily closest to Biden, but amongst the new younger Democratic generation – that Britain has absented itself from a world role by stepping outside the EU and that, in as far as relations with Europe are critical, it is France and Germany who are the key partners and Asia is more of a preoccupation than Europe anyway,” Nandy said.

Are killer robots as horrific as biological weapons? Not necessarily, argue some establishment military theorists and computer scientists. According to Michael Schmitt of the US Naval War College, military robots could police the skies to ensure that a slaughter like Saddam Hussein’s killing of Kurds and Marsh Arabs could not happen again. Ronald Arkin of the Georgia Institute of Technology believes that autonomous weapon systems may “reduce man’s inhumanity to man through technology”, since a robot will not be subject to all-too-human fits of anger, sadism or cruelty. He has proposed taking humans out of the loop of decisions about targeting, while coding ethical constraints into robots. Arkin has also developed target classification to protect sites such as hospitals and schools.
