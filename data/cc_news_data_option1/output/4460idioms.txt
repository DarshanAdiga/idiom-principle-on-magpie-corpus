In the months leading up to Election Day, election officials had to deal with a pandemic that has infected more than 9 million Americans and killed more than 230,000, forcing them to make systemic changes largely on the fly and mostly without federal money. Meanwhile, Trump repeatedly sought to undermine the election with unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.

Additional comments crossing the wires, as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Phillip Lowecontinues to speak at the post-monetary policy meeting press conference on Tuesday. Victoria lockdown has cut 1 to 1.5 ppt off GDP. But outlook for labor market required further policy action even without lockdown. Encourages borrowers to seek lower rates from their banks. Not much room between zero and 0.1% for cash rate. At effective lower bound now. Done all can on rates, focus now on QE. Was broad consensus on policy among RBA board. Not targeting five or 10-year yields. Would be helpful if 10-year yields came down further. To hold around 15% of Australian govt bonds under current plan. If need to buy more bonds, will do so. RBA's latest easing is not a judgement on fiscal policy. Other central banks have bought a lot more debt than we are planning to do. We can effectively create money without limit. Hope not permanently in this world of zero interest rates. Hopes rates will rise sometime in the next five years. Have not ruled out buying bonds outside 5 to 10-year range. Not particularly concerned rates will push up house prices excessively. Updated economic forecasts contain today's policy decision. Market reaction AUD/USD is off the lows but remains in the red below 0.7050 despite Lowe explicitly ruling out negative rates policy. The spot was last seen trading at 0.7042, down 0.12% on the day.

FENTON, Michigan (AP) — As the coronavirus pandemic surges across the nation and infections and hospitalizations rise, medical administrators are scrambling to find enough nursing help — especially in rural areas and at small hospitals. Nurses are being trained to provide care in fields where they have limited experience. Hospitals are scaling back services to ensure enough staff to handle critically ill patients. And health systems are turning to short-term travel nurses to help fill the gaps.Adding to the strain, experienced nurses are “burned out with this whole (pandemic)” and some are quitting, said Kevin Fitzpatrick, an emergency room nurse at Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan, where several left just in the past month to work in hospice or home care or at outpatient clinics.“And replacing them is not easy,” Fitzpatrick said. As a result, he said, the ER is operating at about five nurses short of its optimal level at any given time, and each one typically cares for four patients as COVID-19 hospitalizations surge anew. Hospital officials did not respond to requests for comment. But the departures are not surprising, according to experts, considering not only the mental toll but the fact that many nurses trained in acute care are over 50 and at increased risk of complications if they contract COVID-19, while younger nurses often have children or other family to worry about. “Who can actually work and who feels safe working are limited by family obligations to protect their own health,” said Karen Donelan, professor of U.S. health policy at Brandeis University’s Heller School for Social Policy and Management. “All of those things have been factors.”Donelan said there is little data so far on how the pandemic, which has killed more than 231,000 people in the country, is affecting nursing overall. But some hospitals had a shortage even before the virus took hold, despite a national rise in the number of nurses over the past decade. With total confirmed coronavirus cases surpassing 9 million in the U.S. and new daily infections rising in 47 states, the need is only increasing. Wausau, Wisconsin-based Aspirus Health Care is offering $15,000 signing bonuses for nurses with at least a year of experience and hiring contract nurses through private staffing companies to handle a surge in hospitalizations that prompted the system to almost quadruple the number of beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients. Aspirus, which operates five hospitals in Wisconsin and four in small communities in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, also is moving nurses around between departments and facilities as hot spots emerge, said Ruth Risley-Gray, senior vice president and chief nursing officer at Aspirus.Outside help still is needed, in part because some nurses have gotten sick from or were exposed to the cornavirus during the current wave, which “came with a vengeance” starting in August, Risley-Gray said. At one point in mid-October, 215 staffers were in isolation after showing symptoms or being exposed to someone who tested positive, and some are just starting to return to work.Aspirus recently was able to hire 18 nurses from outside agencies, and may need more if the surge continues. Because the pandemic is surging just about everywhere in the country, hospitals nationwide are competing for the same pool of nurses, offering pay ranging from $1,500 a week to more than $5,000, said April Hansen, executive vice president at San Diego-based Aya Healthcare, which recruits and deploys travel nurses.She said demand for their services has more than doubled since early in the pandemic when the greatest need was in hot spots like New York and New Jersey and then moved to southern states. In recent weeks the virus has been spiking across the country, with the new hot spots in places like the rural upper Midwest and southern-border communities such as El Paso, Texas.Now placing nurses where they’re needed is “like a giant game of whack-a-mole,” said Hansen, whose company has about 20,000 openings for contract nurses.In North Dakota, where infection rates are exploding, hospitals may cut back on elective surgeries and seek government aid to hire more nurses if things get worse, North Dakota Hospital Association president Tim Blasl said. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott recently announced he was sending 75 nurses and respiratory therapists to El Paso to help handle the city’s surge. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, meanwhile, issued emergency orders making it easier for nurses from elsewhere to practice in his state and for retired nurses to come back.“This has been a challenge, and we’ve been pleading with the community members to protect themselves and others,” by wearing masks and social distancing, said Aspirus' Risley-Gray, who said the positivity rate among community members tested by Aspirus rose from under 10% in September to 24% last week.To combat the emotional toll and fatigue that comes with caring for COVID-19 patients, including just donning and removing protective equipment all day, Aspirus has been giving nurses microbreaks and quiet places to get away and collect themselves when they feel overwhelmed. Travel nurses say the need at small hospitals tends to be greater than at larger facilities. Robert Gardner, who’s currently assigned to a hospital in a small town about 20 miles west of Atlanta, said he did search and rescue in the Coast Guard during Hurricane Katrina and the pandemic is “a lot worse.” He worked at a large New Jersey hospital when that state was swamped by the virus in the spring, and now worries that flu season could bring further chaos to hospitals. But he’s determined to stick it out, no matter what. “It’s not even a question,” Gardner said. “Nursing is a calling.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - The Electoral College is written in the Constitution in Article II, Section I.Hans Von Spakovsky from The Heritage Foundation believes the Founding Fathers got it right.“They were afraid that if you had a president elected based simply on the national popular vote, the candidates would simply go to the big cities, the big urban areas, and they would ignore the smaller states, the more rural areas of the country,” Von Spakovsky explained.In 48 states and Washington, D.C., the winner of the popular vote in that state gets all the electoral votes for the state.Maine and Nebraska allocate two electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote in that state and one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each congressional district. There are two congressional districts in Maine and three in Nebraska.A candidate needs at least 270 out of 538 electoral votes to win the election.Five times in U.S. history, the winner of the presidential election did not win the popular vote – including George W. Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016. That’s twice in the past five elections, and there is a growing call to abolish the Electoral College.“The Electoral College basically empowers those small and mid-size states over the larger states where the economic activity is taking place,” said Darrell West, from The Brookings Institution. “That is not a sustainable system in the long run.”West supports a direct popular election – meaning people would vote directly for a candidate, not an elector. He said a constitutional amendment would most likely be required to abolish the Electoral College.An alternative would be to keep the Electoral College, but have the states award their electors to the winner of the nationwide popular vote, not the state’s popular vote.So far, 15 states and Washington, D.C. have signed the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact supporting this plan– totaling 196 electoral votes. The compact needs 74 more electoral votes to take effect.Senior Reporter/Executive Producer Ted Fioraliso, Multimedia Journalist Natalie Grim, and Photojournalist/Editor Tyler Smith contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Gray DC.

There are places where the competing strategies overlap: exurban counties — those communities on the edges of the large metropolitan footprints — and counties anchored by smaller stand-alone cities. Both campaigns will be closely watching places like Forsyth County, Georgia, where 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney won 80% of the vote but Trump’s share dropped 10 points, and Montgomery County, Ohio, which flipped from Democrat Barack Obama to Trump.
 A 1968 REDUX? HOW ABOUT 1980?
 Trump spent considerable energy this year posturing as a “law and order” president, seeking to replicate 1968, when widespread unrest in the U.S benefited Republican Richard Nixon as he built his “silent majority.” But Nixon wasn’t the incumbent in 1968. In fact, the political atmosphere was so bad for President Lyndon Johnson that the Democrat didn’t seek reelection.
 Many Democrats and some Republicans are now pointing more at 1980, when Republican Ronald Reagan trounced President Jimmy Carter and the GOP flipped a whopping 12 Democratic Senate seats. Trump’s standing in the polls over 2020 has tracked only slightly above where Carter spent much of the 1980 election year, as he battled inflation, high unemployment and the Iran hostage crisis. But what appeared a tight race on paper as late as October turned into a rout. Even Democratic heavyweights like Indiana Sen. Birch Bayh and South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, once a presidential nominee, fell.

The Church also does wonderful thing for the folks of the surrounding communities, including feeding and tutoring them.
 “Alice’s Restaurant” became an anti-war anthem. Arlo’s description of his time at the draft board was classic. Remember? He had thrown garbage into the Stockbridge dump and ended up being disqualified to serve and being put onto the “Group W” bench with other heinous felons. We all love the story about how he was invited to the White House when Jimmy Carter was President and found that Nixon had left his “Alice’s Restaurant” album on the shelf.
 That song was exactly eighteen minutes long, the same eighteen minutes that has been erased from the Nixon tapes.
 If one got lucky over the past number of years, you got an elongated version of “Alice’s Restaurant” that took up a half a concert. I don’t know how he felt about doing it again and again, but I never heard anyone complain. In fact, if you were lucky enough to hear him sing it, you felt like you had been given a very precious gift.
 He has performed all over the world. One of my favorite stories is when he and Pete were singing in a massive concert where the people listening spoke a foreign language and they ran out of folk songs so Arlo started to sing the Elvis tune, “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” Arlo says that he thought Pete wouldn’t like that but the whole audience began to sing that song. Arlo looked over at Pete and it turns out he was singing it, too.
 That’s what you have to love about Arlo. He really makes you feel good.

Battling a bout of New England bad weather, 21-year-old Abigail Rose made her way to the polls to vote in her first presidential election.
 Rose, an Acushnet native who now works in and around New Bedford as a real estate agent, will be one of a potentially record-breaking number of young voters to cast their ballots in the Nov. 3 election, according to an Oct. 26 Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School poll that suggests higher voter turnout of 18-to-29-year-olds than in several decades.
 "It is exciting, I'm glad that I'm able to use my voice," said Rose.
 A total of 63% of poll respondents said they would "definitely be voting," as opposed to 47% in 2016, and 48.4% in 2008, which saw the highest youth turnout since 1984.
 Justin Tseng, chair of the Harvard Public Opinions Project, said this election will likely see "historic numbers" of young voters.
 The Harvard Youth Poll is a biennial survey that is largely student-run. Tseng, a junior at Harvard University studying social studies, said the poll's student leadership brings a youthful perspective.
 Young people are being motivated to vote by issues around diversity, according to Rose, who attended Black Lives Matter protests in New Bedford.
 The poll shows strong support for the government to address systemic racism. The survey found 71% of all young Americans, across racial demographics - including 50% of young Americans who identify as Republicans - said they support increased government action to improve race relations.
 Tyson Moultrie, one of the founding directors of VOTE New Bedford, said equity and diversity are some of the main issues "firing people up" to vote in the city.
 Members of the organization have been attending both Black Lives Matter and Back the Blue protests over the past few months as a nonpartisan initiative to increase voting. Moultrie said there are young people out on both sides.
 Many local Black Lives Matter protests have focused on Malcolm Gracia, a Black 15-year-old who was shot and killed by New Bedford police officers in 2012.
 "That's something that has manifested very heavily as a pivot point for voter turnout," Moultrie said. "It has put a battery in the back of the younger generation, especially the Black and brown voter population here that normally shies away from elections."
 The Harvard Youth Poll didn't just show what issues were motivating young Black voters, but also how they were voting this year.
 Results showed this demographic reporting lower confidence that their ballots would be counted, and a higher likelihood to vote in-person than any other racial group.
 This distrust comes from a history of Black voter suppression, according to Laurel Berryman, 22, a racial and gender equity program coordinator at YWCA Southeastern Massachusetts. While she doesn't discourage others from voting by mail, she said that as a Black woman she chose to vote in-person to ensure her vote was counted.
 "If I can eliminate any possible extra thing that may cause my vote not to be counted, I'm going to do that," she said. "I'd rather go to the polls early -- which I did a few weeks ago -- write it down, and put it in the box myself and know it's there. I've definitely seen a lot of other people feeling the exact same way."
 Moultrie said VOTE New Bedford has been emphasizing the importance of voting in all elections, not just the presidential election every four years.
 In the primary election this past September, New Bedford had a 22% voter turnout rate -- double the 11.5% rate of registered voters who went to the polls in the 2018 primaries.
 "There's something to vote on the first Tuesday of every November, every year," he said.
 Scott Ferson, a political consultant and founder of the political incubator The Blue Lab, echoed the importance of establishing a habit of voting and solidifying young voters with a party at this point in their lives. Ferson said this increase in young voter participation is "an important long-term investment," but he doesn't think it will ultimately make a difference in determining the presidential winner this year.
 The electoral system doesn't lend much weight to the youth vote, according to Ferson. He said if voter participation among 18-to-25-year-olds in 2016 had been 30 points higher, it only would have changed the electoral outcome in one state.
 "Unlike Latinx voters, white female voters or middle-aged voters who can change results in certain key states, the youth vote isn't distributed that way," he said. "A lot of the swing states tend to skew quite old in terms of voters."
 Even so, the presidential election isn't the only issue on the ballot this semester. One race that has garnered significant attention has been Sen. Edward Markey's reelection campaign.
 Markey received overwhelming youth support during his primary election campaign this September. Ferson said this "phenomenon" likely has to do with the senator's long-time support of environmental justice, an issue voters in this age group deeply care about.
 Shane Burgo, a New Bedford native who now works as an affirmative action officer of the New Bedford Democratic City Committee and is a Massachusetts delegate for Democratic nominee Joe Biden, cited climate change as one of the most important issues being addressed in this election.
 Burgo campaigned for Markey in his primary race against Rep. Joe Kennedy III. He attributed his strong support for the senator to his co-sponsorship of the Green New Deal.
 "In some respects, Senator Markey was a blank slate, especially with young voters, they didn't really know him too well," Ferson said. "Sometimes the person meets the moment, and sometimes the moment meets the person. With Ed Markey, he didn't change to meet a particular moment; he was there and the moment met him."
 Other races on the ballot this November include Evan Gendreau's challenge of incumbent Democrat Rep. Paul A. Schmid III of Westport Originally from Fall River, if the 21-year-old Republican is elected he will be the youngest person serving at the Statehouse.
 "Many of our campaign's volunteers are first-time voters and it is very helpful to have their input," Gendreau wrote in an email. "Having more young voters is good for democracy, as it ensures our government is more representative of our community."
 As for the presidential race, the Harvard Youth Poll shows Biden's favorability increasing among young people.
 The spring 2020 edition of the poll showed 34% of all young adults viewed Biden favorably, compared to a 47% favorability rate among the same demographic in the most recent poll.
 The pollsters at Harvard didn't expect this significant increase, according to Tseng.
 "What did surprise us was the shift from the spring from people voting for Biden as a way to vote against Trump, and people voting for Biden just because they like the vice president," he said.
 A total of 63% of Biden supporters in the Harvard poll expect him to win, compared to 74% of Trump voters who said they expected the sitting president to win the election.
 Tseng said he is hopeful that the youth vote will influence the election this November, and that young voters will continue to affect politics both nationally and in Massachusetts in the future.
 "Our poll should be a wakeup call to the politicians sitting on Beacon Hill to look at their agenda, look at the issues we're considering, and really reconsider their focus and place young people -- who are the future of the commonwealth -- at the center of their discussion," he said.

 Abraham said: “When I first got elected way back in 2000 I came into the job agenda free. I understand the job to serve, I understand what that means.”
 Write-in candidate Dujuan Thomas also campaigned outside of the McCracken County Courthouse. Thomas won’t appear on the ballot, but voters are able to write his name in if they choose to do so.
 “I want to fix our priorities here in our city which is our roads, our sewers, and our South Side,” Thomas said. “So I think I'm best qualified because I'm wanting to get the job done and getting the things that we want fixed here in the city done.”
 Polls will close at 6 p.m. today. Voters in Paducah will also elect new members to the city commission. Sandra Wilson is the only current commissioner running for reelection.

The two men also broke sharply Monday on the voting process itself while campaigning in the most fiercely contested battleground, Pennsylvania.
 The president threatened legal action to stop counting beyond Election Day. If Pennsylvania ballot counting takes several days, as is allowed, Trump charged that “cheating can happen like you have never seen. ”
 Biden, in Pittsburgh, pushed a voting rights message to a mostly Black audience, declaring that Trump believes “only wealthy folks should vote” and describing COVID-19 as a “mass casualty event for Black Americans.”
 “We’re done with the chaos, we’re done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility,” said Biden, whose campaign has focused on increasing turnout for Black voters, who could prove the difference in several battleground states.
 Both campaigns insist they have a pathway to victory, though Biden’s options for winning the required 270 Electoral College votes are more plentiful. Trump is banking on a surge of enthusiasm from his most loyal supporters in addition to potential legal maneuvers.
 BEATING VIRUS
 Trump spent the final full campaign day sprinting through five rallies, from North Carolina to Pennsylvania to Wisconsin. Biden devoted most of his time to Pennsylvania, where a win would leave Trump with an exceedingly narrow path. He also dipped into Ohio, a show of confidence in a state that Trump won by 8 percentage points four years ago.
 The two men delivered their final messages, with Biden emphasizing the pandemic. He declared that “the first step to beating the virus is beating Donald Trump,” and he promised he would retain the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, whom the president has talked of firing.
 ‘UNDER SIEGE’
 Trump, meanwhile, made only passing mention of what his aides believe are his signature accomplishments — the nation’s economic rebound, the recent installation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett — in favor of a torrent of grievance and combativeness. He angrily decried the media’s coverage of the campaign while complaining that he also was being treated unfairly by, in no particular order, China, the Electoral College system and rock singer Jon Bon Jovi.
 “I have been under siege illegally for three-and-a-half years. I wonder what it would be like if we didn’t have all of this horrible stuff. We’d have a very, very calm situation,” said Trump at an evening rally in Michigan. “People see that we fight and I’m fighting for you. I’m fighting to survive. You have to survive.”
 EARLY VOTING
 Biden announced an unusual move to campaign on Election Day, saying he would head to Philadelphia and his native Scranton on Tuesday as part of a get-out- the-vote effort. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, will visit Detroit, a heavily Black city in battleground Michigan, and both of their spouses will hit the road too. Trump, at least for now, was not scheduled to travel on Tuesday.

RAPID TEST PLAN
 Essex County Senior Public Health Educator Andrea Whitmarsh said they’re developing a rapid test plan with Hudson Headwaters Health Network, University of Vermont Health Network-Elizabethtown Community Hospital and Adirondack Health-Adirondack Medical Center to provide the tests.
 “They (the rapid tests) are not in use yet; we just received them last week,” she said Monday.
 “There are steps that need to be taken in order to get this testing up and running. We’re hoping to be operational within the next couple weeks, if not sooner.”
 Use of the molecular machines and cards moves diagnostic testing for COVID-19 from laboratory settings to the point of care.
 Essex County has had outbreaks at the Essex Center nursing home in Elizabethtown and Lee House senior apartments in Port Henry, where rapid tests would have been beneficial.
 NEW CASES
 One site for the new rapid tests might be Elderwood Uihlein Lake Placid Nursing Home in Lake Placid, where one resident was confirmed positive for the coronavirus on Monday. The individual is not hospitalized.
 One other new case was reported Monday in Essex County, in the town of North Elba.

KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) — Early voters waiting in line at Kenosha’s municipal offices couldn’t miss the dozens of buildings still boarded up in this little lakefront city. They might have passed the post office with its covered windows, the plywood-fortified dinosaur museum or the barricaded jeweler, yoga studio or grocery store.Many of these businesses are open, but they are also hedging their bets, covering up windows and sometimes building outer sets of plywood doors that can be easily shut, like castles pulling up their drawbridges, if trouble returns. With a divisive election just a day away, it’s no surprise they’re being careful.Yet two months after street violence shook Kenosha, far more businesses have taken their plywood down. The music store is selling ukuleles again. Neighborhood taverns are serving cheap beer and good company. People are walking along the Lake Michigan waterfront, even if the winds are increasingly bitter.Kenosha has been battered, but it’s certainly not defeated. “This city is a lot stronger than people give it credit for,” said Anthony Kennedy, an African American alderman.People leave Kenosha's municipal offices for early voting while cars wait in line for drive-thru voting, Friday, Oct. 30, 2020, in Kenosha, Wis.Greg Guthrie emerged from the municipal offices late last week and said he doubted the violence had shifted the political ground very much.“I don’t think it’s changed anyone’s vote,” the 51-year-old mechanical engineer said. “But I think it’s probably increased the turnout.”“It’s galvanized both sides” of the political divide, which he believes has only grown wider.What happened in Kenosha and in other American cities during a summer of protests could be critical to the outcome of Tuesday’s presidential election in Wisconsin and other battleground states. For President Donald Trump and his law-and-order campaign, protests that skidded into violence show that only he can keep such unrest from spreading. But for African Americans, racial minorities and many Democrats, the killings of Black people by police officers, which set off most of the demonstrations, show that America is in desperate need of change.The trouble in Kenosha began on Aug. 23, when a police officer, responding to a call about a domestic dispute, was seen on video shooting Jacob Blake repeatedly in the back at close range. Blake, a Black man, was left paralyzed from the waist down.The shooting set off waves of protests , some of which turned destructive. Buildings and cars were set on fire and stores looted.The violence spiked on Aug. 25, when two protesters were shot and killed and another was injured. Kyle Rittenhouse, a white 17-year-old who came to Kenosha that day with a semiautomatic rifle, is charged in the shootings.Rittenhouse’s lawyers have called him a patriot acting in self-defense while defending the streets of Kenosha. If convicted, the teenager, who is from just across the state line in Antioch, Illinois, could spend the rest of his life in prison.He was among a number of armed white men who came to Kenosha, saying they wanted to protect property during the unrest.“As awful as the property damage was, and it was awful, it’s not as bad as taking lives,” said Kennedy, whose district includes the street where Blake was shot. “It wasn’t the left (who killed people). It wasn’t antifa. It was a white boy from Antioch who came to our town and killed two people.”The August shootings have spurred political involvement in Kenosha, with the formation of activist groups and thousands of people signing up to vote.“People are asking some very hard questions and demanding answers,” he said.“The amount of voter apathy in our town is shocking,” Kennedy said. “But in September we had 4,000 new voter registrations” in surrounding Kenosha County, which has some 95,000 registered voters.Those new voters could be politically potent. Trump won Kenosha County in the 2016 elections by fewer than 300 votes, while the city of Kenosha went solidly for Hillary Clinton.A city of about 100,000, Kenosha was once home to a huge Chrysler assembly plant that closed in 1988. Now Amazon distribution warehouses have become major employers.Trump has made the violence in Kenosha and other American cities a key part of his reelection campaign, blaming Democrats and saying violence would spread if Democratic nominee Joe Biden defeats him.“These are not acts of peaceful protest but, really, domestic terror,” Trump said in a visit to the city about a week after Blake was shot.Trump is expected to hold a rally in Kenosha on Monday evening, hours before polls open, a sign of how important he sees law-and-order issues to his reelection.A new poll from Marquette University Law School has Biden leading in Wisconsin with 48% of the support of likely voters, ahead of Trump with 43%. Those numbers that have changed little since the school’s polling in early September. However, the polls also show a jump in Trump’s approval numbers in Wisconsin since mid-June on how he handled the protests, rising from 30% to 40%.Trump’s rhetoric infuriates Nathan Upham, a 23-year-old Kenosha activist who blames the president for not understanding the anger and frustration over racial injustice and police violence at the root of the protests.“You’re painting this terrible picture of the real activism work that we’re doing,” he said. “It’s pretty much a slap in the face.”Kenosha officials are concerned that armed civilians could descend on the city again if trouble emerges around the election, but they see no sign of it yet.“I’m always going to be concerned about violence,” said Andy Berg, a member of the Kenosha County board of supervisors. “But at this point it’s all speculation.”Sheriff David Beth has said people like Rittenhouse inflame the situation.“They came in and their intention was to intimidate, to scare and create confrontation. And they did exactly that,” Beth said in an October interview with the Wisconsin radio station WTMJ. “And we had a 17-year-old who shouldn’t have been carrying an assault rifle through the streets of Kenosha ... I couldn’t have asked for a worse ending to that Tuesday night.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Bail was set at $2 million on Monday for a 17-year-old from Illinois accused of killing two men during an August protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after the father of one victim told the court the teen “thinks he’s above the law” and would disappear if freed before the trial.Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, is charged with fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber during a protest over a police shooting in August. He is also charged with wounding a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz.Rittenhouse turned himself in to police in Antioch the morning after the Aug. 25 shootings. He was extradited to Wisconsin on Friday and made his initial court appearance in Kenosha County on Monday afternoon.In addition to the homicide charges, Rittenhouse faces counts of attempted homicide, reckless endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm.His attorney, Mark Richards, asked Court Commissioner Loren Keating to set bail at $750,000 and place Rittenhouse on electronic monitoring, arguing that the protesters had attacked the teen that night and that Rittenhouse had fired in self-defense.Richards also argued that Rittenhouse tried to turn himself in seconds after the shootings but officers ignored him. Video showed Rittenhouse walk past police vehicles with an assault-style weapon slung over his shoulder and his hands in the air. No one stopped him even though protesters could be heard screaming that he had just shot people. Police later explained that they didn’t arrest him at the scene because it was chaotic.Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger asked for $2 million bond, noting that Rittenhouse faces life in prison if convicted of the homicide charges, which makes him a flight risk.“The defendant doesn’t want to be here and if released won’t come back,” Binger said.Keating allowed Huber’s father, John Huber, to speak during the video hearing. He asked the commissioner to set bail between $4 million and $10 million. He said that Rittenhouse has become a rallying symbol for conservatives upset by the destruction of property during protests this year over police brutality. People have been raising money for Rittenhouse and militia groups would gladly hide him from police, Huber alleged.A legal defense fund for Rittenhouse has attracted millions of dollars in donations. Rittenhouse’s mother got a standing ovation from women in the audience at a Waukesha County GOP function in September, according to a tweet from conservative commentator Michelle Malkin.“Kyle Rittenhouse thinks he’s above the law,” Huber said. “He’s been treated as much by law enforcement. For him to run wouldn’t surprise me.”Huber’s son hit Rittenhouse with a skateboard before Rittenhouse shot him, but was he only trying to stop Rittenhouse, the father said.“Self-defense, that’s impossible,” he said, growing more agitated as he spoke. “He had already killed a guy and tried to run. My son was a hero. He tried to stop him. He was a hero. Anyone who says otherwise is dead wrong, including the president. How dare he.”President Donald Trump has said Rittenhouse’s actions might have been warranted, suggesting that the protesters might have killed him.Richards tried to object to Huber’s remarks, but Keating cut him off.Grosskreutz’s attorney, Kimberley Motley, asked for $4 million bail, calling Rittenhouse’s behavior “inexcusable.”Keating set bail at $2 million, saying Rittenhouse has no ties to Kenosha, he fled the state after the shootings and he faces life in prison if convicted. He ordered Rittenhouse not to have any contact with the victims' families or to possess any weapons if he’s released.Rittenhouse attended the hearing via a video feed from jail and was wearing an orange mask and a dark blue jail jumpsuit. He spoke only to say that he understood the conditions of his release.The shootings happened two days after a white police officer trying to arrest Jacob Blake shot the 29-year-old Black man seven times in the back, paralyzing him from the waist down. Video of the shooting sparked several nights of protests in Kenosha, a city of about 100,000 on the Wisconsin-Illinois border.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Delivering yet another indicator that the ongoing pandemic will permanently alter the way movies are consumed, publicly traded exhibition chain AMC Theaters just reported a stunning $905.8 million loss in the third quarter.
 The July-September period is usually when exhibition chains make hay. But the pandemic ravaged AMC saw revenue drop 90.9% from a Q3 2019 period during which it raked in $1.3 billion. The chain made only $119.5 million in sales during this year’s third quarter, during which most of the chain's theaters where shuttered.
 Revenue was actually in line with Wall Street’s expectations. But how long can the nation's biggest movie chain sustain these kinds of hits?
