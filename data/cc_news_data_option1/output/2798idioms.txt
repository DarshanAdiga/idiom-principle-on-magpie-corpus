And, yes, the Canadiens will have to contend with arguably the best player in the world in Sidney Crosby (not to mention cohort Evgeni Malkin).

BOSTON - There has been no formal conversation between Ron Roenicke and Nathan Eovaldi, but the Red Sox manager came closer than ever before Tuesday to tipping his hand regarding his Opening Day starter.
 Eduardo Rodriguez remains home recovering from the coronavirus and was recently placed on the injured list. Eovaldi's current five-day schedule would have him pitching again Sunday and then next Friday when the Baltimore Orioles come to Fenway Park for the July 24 season opener.
 Chris Sale will miss the season after Tommy John surgery, Rick Porcello signed with the Mets in free agency and David Price was traded to the Dodgers. Clay Buchholz, Jon Lester and Josh Beckett are long gone, and that takes you all the way back to the start of the 2009 season.
 Eovaldi looks set to etch his name in club history, and he seems quite prepared to do so after his latest intrasquad outing Tuesday morning. He scattered four hits and didn't issue a walk between the on-field mound and the covered bullpen under the grandstand, retreating when a brief storm swept through in the top of the fourth inning.
 "I feel like I'm ready to go," Eovaldi said. "I went 82 pitches today. I'm not going out there and taking it easy, either.
 "I'm throwing all my pitches. I'm using my mix. I feel like I'm ready."
 What does Roenicke think about that? Certainly he'd like to have Rodriguez available after eclipsing 200 innings pitched and 200 strikeouts in a breakout 2019. But Eovaldi is the most experienced starter the Red Sox currently have in Summer Camp, and he appears to be approaching peak form.
 "I haven't said anything to him yet," Roenicke said. "That conversation will probably happen in the next day or two. You guys can figure out the numbers there."
 Eovaldi was limited to just 23 appearances last season after April surgery to remove bone chips from his right elbow. Only 12 of those were starts, and he finished with a 5.99 earned-run average. It was an inauspicious beginning to the four-year, $68-million deal he signed coming off a 2018 World Series victory.
 "Before we came back for Spring Training 2.0 or whatever you want to call it I was throwing a lot," Eovaldi said. "Five or six innings, around 100 pitches each time - it was almost like a nice little break and then build back up."
 Eovaldi's willingness to sacrifice and his performance during that postseason gave him instant credibility in the clubhouse. The 30-year-old's middling career numbers still leave him with plenty to prove. Fronting a rotation expected by most to struggle could present the ideal challenge.
 "I think any time you're in that position and you're one of the guys a team counts on, it's a good feeling," Roenicke said. "He's pitched enough in the big leagues. He's had enough success in the big leagues. He's gone through struggles in the big leagues. I think all of those things allow him to handle it if we go Opening Day with him.
 "I'm not worried about the makeup. I know there will be a little anxiety there, and that's fine. But we feel good if he's that guy."
 Cesar Puello's single through the right side plated the only run against Eovaldi in the second, an inning that was extended by an infield error. Eovaldi started the third with a strikeout of Kevin Pillar that showed off something of a new wrinkle. The right-hander was working from the windup but went with a slide step out front, surprising Pillar with a much quicker delivery to the plate.
 "I'll just kind of mix it in,' Eovaldi said. "It's been easy for me. It keeps the hitters off balance and keeps them guessing."
 Brandon Workman surrendered an earned run for the third time in as many camp appearances. He started opposite Eovaldi and had his first pitch whacked for a double to the gap in left-center by Andrew Benintendi. Alex Verdugo's infield out went for an RBI, as Benintendi took third on a wild pitch and trotted home on the grounder to deep first.
 Jackie Bradley Jr. and Christian Vazquez also enjoyed solid days at the plate. Bradley smoked a triple to the gap in right-center and knocked a two-run single to center. Vazquez singled twice against Eovaldi, finding a hole through the left side and sending a liner to left-center.
 "I'm very pleased with the offense," Roenicke said. "There are some guys pitching-wise who really got better and some guys who we still are expecting to get locked in and be depth for us and help us."

The Center Square) – In response to a temporary restraining order filed by Dr. Steven Hotze in response to Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner banning the Republican Party of Texas (RPT) from holding an in-person convention, federal Judge Lynn Hughes said the mayor’s actions were unconstitutional but denied the restraining order request because of a legal technicality.
 The RPT Convention was scheduled to hold in-person meetings at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston from July 16-18. One week prior to the convention, Turner announced that he told the leasing agent of the center, Houston First Corporation, to cancel the contract, which it did.
 Hughes agreed that Turner’s request violated the First Amendment rights of delegates to the convention.
 “Judge Hughes gave us a very fair hearing,” Hotze said. “He understood the constitutional issues very well and stated that Mayor Turner had denied Republican delegates First Amendment rights.”
 But because the RPT and Chairman of the RPT, James Dickey, had not joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs, the judge said he was unable to find an equitable solution. And because the RPT had already voted on July 13 to hold an online virtual convention, the TRO was moot.
 Dickey was asked to join Hotze’s lawsuit and declined.
 “Dickey could have simply intervened in the lawsuit, but he chose not to do so,” Hotze said.
 Instead, the RPT filed a separate lawsuit, which was rejected by the district court and Texas Supreme Court.
 “The Party argues it has constitutional rights to hold a convention and engage in electoral activities, and that is unquestionably true,” the Supreme Court wrote in its opinion. “But those rights do not allow it to simply commandeer use of the Center.”
 In response to the Texas Supreme Court’s ruling, Dickey said, “We had hoped that the Supreme Court of Texas would recognize that the issue before it involved constitutionally protected rights flowing from our contract with the Convention Center and confirm that a contract cannot be breached for political purposes.
 “We believe that Mayor Turner used his control of city-owned property to disenfranchise Republicans and attempt to deny them the opportunity to cast their votes for national delegates and electors in-person in Houston,” he added.
 The mayor argued that the convention could not have been held safely even after he organized and participated in a crowded protest of roughly 60,000 people, for which the downtown area of Houston was shut down. The convention was expecting roughly one-tenth of the number of people who participated in the protest.
 Retired Lt. Colonel Allen West, who is running against Dickey for party chair, attended the hearing in person in support of Hotze’s suit.
 At the convention, which begins Thursday, delegates will adopt a party platform, elect party officers and National Delegates and Alternates, and possibly vote on the censures several county GOP groups have already passed expressing condemnation of actions taken by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.

BOSTON - Few aspects of this summer's unprecedented NHL training camps would be considered ideal. Some teams and players, in fact, are experiencing situations that are less ideal than others.
 Consider the Bruins, who were without Top 6 forwards David Pastrnak, their 2019-20 scoring leader, and Ondrej Kase, as their camp began this week. While they fulfilled the coronavirus-related quarantine and testing protocols required for players returning from Europe, Pastrnak couldn't skate until Wednesday morning's small-group session at Warrior Arena, and Kase still hadn't participated.
 In the case of Pastrnak, who tied for the NHL lead with 48 goals and ranked third with 95 points, the prospect of the 24-year-old winger not joining the full group until Thursday wasn't all that alarming. Pastrnak, after all, has spent the better part of two seasons on perhaps the best line in the NHL with left wing Brad Marchand (87 points, sixth in the league) and center Patrice Bergeron, who scored 56 points in 61 games. A few missed practices wasn't likely to hold the trio back much, if at all.
 "We have lots of chemistry that's been going on for quite some time," Bergeron said. "Hopefully we can rely on that moving forward."
 Kase's situation is different. Acquired from the Ducks in a trade on Feb. 21, he only played six games with the Bruins before the NHL had to shut down the season on March 12. Kase, 24, played all those games with No. 2 center David Krejci, but contributed only one assist, and the pair hadn't seemed to complement each other.
 "Obviously, we didn't get as many games as we'd like to," Krejci said. "Hopefully he'll be back soon, and we can start doing some reps as a line, try to create some chemistry."
 Kase's absence from the full group, which Cassidy still hoped would end by Thursday, may have benefited others. Younger wingers Anders Bjork and Karson Kuhlman got to spend a practice apiece with Krejci early in the week, and Krejci at least had a familiar face on his line: Jake DeBrusk, bumped off Krejci's line after almost two years when the B's acquired Kase and, in a later trade with the Ducks, Nick Ritchie, is getting a chance to re-establish his working establishment with Krejci.
 "Sometimes, absence makes the heart grow fonder, so maybe they'll re-connect after a little time away," Cassidy said. "They've had good chemistry in the past."
 That return to familiarity, however, left the Charlie Coyle-centered third line almost entirely under construction. Ritchie, who had also been playing with Krejci, joined Coyle as line's left wing while Sean Kuraly - a true center who'd been made Coyle's right wing just before the season was paused - shifted to right wing as camp began. The status of Kuraly, who has been most valuable to the B's as their No. 4 center over the last three seasons, remains uncertain once right wings Pastrnak and Kase are in the fold.
 With camp scheduled to run locally through July 25 before the Bruins head for the Eastern Conference hub city of Toronto to complete training in advance of their Aug. 2 round robin opener against the Flyers, Cassidy thinks there's enough time to sort things out. That belief, however, hinges in large part on the ability of Pastrnak and Kase to get up to speed.
 "I think missing (practices) early, if you've been doing some off-ice work or skating on your own, wherever you've been, you can catch up," the coach said. "If you were to miss a full week, and Return To Play practices (Cassidy's preferred name for the local portion of camp) are only two weeks, and then you're getting into it, now you're talking 50 percent of the time off. So it will affect you."
 Given a much longer history with Pastrnak, whom he also coached at AHL Providence in 2014-15 and '15-16, Cassidy knew what to expect when Pastrnak returned Wednesday. Kase is more of a mystery.
 "Some guys can certainly make up the ground quicker than others," Cassidy said. "That's just the way some guys are wired. Missing a day or two here or there for maintenance, I don't think will affect you a ton, unless you're that guy who mentally needs an exact routine.
 "Right now, I think there's opportunity to catch up. But as we get closer, that becomes less and less, and I think the effect becomes greater and greater on the player trying to play catch-up."

So, yes, if Domi does decide to play it safe, which is what he probably should do, the Habs will miss him. Because of his health condition (diabetes) and how he is at greater risk of complications should he contract COVID-19, the Habs are already being cautious. They have released a statement saying Domi will wait up to 10 days before joining the team at training camp.

It’s for the best, really. The last thing the Canadiens or anyone else should want is for Domi to take a chance with his long-term health and career. So, it’s far from out of the question that Domi will end up sitting on the sidelines when it comes time to play the Penguins (if the play-in round and playoffs do end up taking place).

La banda delle tabaccherie non si ferma e continua a colpire senza sosta. Nel mirino della banda, questa volta, è finita la rivendita di via Appia 876 a Scauri, conosciuta da tutti come Generoso, dal nome dell'ex proprietario. Ingente il bottino portato via dai banditi, che è di diverse migliaia di euro. I banditi, con la solita tecnica, hanno tagliato la serranda e sono penetrati all'interno del locale, portando via sigarette, gratta e vinci, denaro ed anche una macchinetta cambiamonete. Ma quest'ultima, che non conteneva nulla, è stata abbandonata fuori dal locale. Gli autori dell'ennesimo furto ai tabacchi, come di consueto, hanno agito completamente travisati, per evitare il riconoscimento da parte delle telecamere di videosorveglianza. Ancora una volta è stata segnalata una Audi sul luogo del furto che, sembra, sia stato messo a segno da una gang di stranieri.
 Una banda che sarebbe la stessa che ha colpito pochi giorni fa il bar Pierino a Spigno, la rivendita di tabacchi di via Luigi Cadorna e Fontana Perrelli a Minturno. Ma negli ultimi tempi sono stati diversi i raid notturni del gruppo, che ha agito in una tabaccheria posta vicino a quella visitata l'altra notte, ma anche in altre del Comune di Minturno, Santi Cosma e Damiano e Formia. Si tratta di un gruppo di specialisti che fanno della rapidità il loro punto di forza. A volte, se disturbati dal passaggio di auto o persone, compiono il furto a tappe, allontanandosi e ritornando poco dopo.
 Se non hanno alternative di poter entrare attraverso porte o finestre laterali, attaccano la serranda e la tagliano. Una volta all'interno agiscono in pochissimi secondi e nonostante il suo dell'antifurto prendono tutto ciò che è possibile e fuggono. L'Audi più volte segnalata sembra sia una macchina rubata e il gruppo dovrebbe avere il proprio covo in Campania. C'è preoccupazione tra i tabaccai per questo nuovo colpo messo a segno, ma i Carabinieri hanno già raccolto importanti elementi, che potrebbero avere sviluppi nei prossimi giorni. Un'indagine molto difficile, in considerazione della scaltrezza del gruppo, che già da tempo continua a visitare le tabaccherie del sud pontino. I luoghi dove rubare vengono scelti a macchia di leopardo ed è difficile coglierli sul fatto, soprattutto per la rapidità con cui si muovono ed agiscono.

The Canadiens are undeniably a better team with Domi in the lineup. However, any argument they’re dead in the water against the Penguins if he doesn’t play, doesn’t do justice to other Habs, many of whom are poised to have a greater impact in the series. It’s likely going to be a lot closer than many people believe as a result.
