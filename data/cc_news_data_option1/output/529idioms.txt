Any athlete competing at the Division I level will say that every game is tough to win and that style points shouldn’t matter. That’s true, to a point. Any additional buckets would have extended the Eagles’ margin of victory, but the most important stat in any of those scenarios would have been the simple fact that Georgia Southern won and improved its spot in the league standings.
   
 But that line of thinking was inches away from being turning into a disaster.
   
 The final missed free throw for the Eagles came with five seconds to play. One made free throw would have made it impossible for ULM to win in regulation. Two of them would have iced the game on the spot. Instead, Jackson’s first attempt bounced hard off the rim. There was enough time for the Warhawks to win a jump ball for the rebound and pass the ball into open space, leading to a heave from halfcourt that saw the bottom of the ball begin to clear the rim before rattling out as the final buzzer sounded.

“We are embracing the spread from the start," said Jeffrey Pollack, the league's president and chief operating officer. "This is a core business strategy for the XFL. We understand that for a lot of our fans, betting on the games has become as essential to the game experience as the helmet, ball and jerseys. That’s what we’re gearing up to provide. Our mission and our infrastructure are geared to the sports betting future that is coming fast. There are incredible opportunities.”
   
 So far, gambling regulators in at least nine states have approved wagering on XFL games: New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania, New York, Iowa, Indiana, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and West Virginia.
   
 And in a big change for a major professional league in the U.S., ABC and ESPN will continuously broadcast the point spread and the under/over on total points scored in the game as part of their on-screen graphics. Announcers will even discuss how a particular play affects the point spread or the over/under — something you never hear on an NFL broadcast.

The purpose of the removal was never political. It was never meant to be, and should never have been, in view of the Democrats being in a better political position after the end. For these reasons, it was, as Nancy Pelosi clearly felt, to the edge of the abyss, a bet that was not worth taking. The reasonable argument for why one should try was that not to remove Donald Trump was not, well, reasonable. To allow the obvious carelessness to pass without dispute was to collaborate in it. The impeachment was undertaken on principle - the principle that the rule of law is important and the corollary principle that political parties are not mandated to practice passivity. And this was, it must always be remembered, undertaken not at the political request of a few radicals but in response to the collective and appropriate panic of the national security and intelligence professionals within the executive, who whistled and testified because they believed the president's behavior was as bad as bad could be. Whether it was politically advantageous or not in the short term, it would have been politically disastrous in the long term to move away from such a conflict started with patriotic good faith. Law should really be important here.

Next came word that Gordon Sondland, Trump’s ambassador to the European Union, also was out.
 “I was advised today that the President intends to recall me effective immediately as United States Ambassador to the European Union,” Sondland said in a statement.
 The White House had not been coy about whether Trump would retaliate against those he viewed as foes in the impeachment drama. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Thursday that Trump was glad it was over and “maybe people should pay for that.”
 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted after Vindman’s ouster that Trump’s action showed “as usual, the White House runs away from the truth.”
 “This action is not a sign of strength. It only shows President Trump’s weakness,” Schumer wrote.
 Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., called it “the Friday Night Massacre,” likening the situation to President Richard Nixon’s so-called Saturday night massacre, when top Justice Department officials resigned after refusing to do his bidding by firing a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. (The prosecutor himself was fired anyway.)
 Referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Speier added, “I’m sure Trump is fuming that he can’t fire Pelosi.”
 Since his acquittal, Trump has held nothing back in lashing out at his critics, including Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the only Republican to vote against him. On Friday, he also took after Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia whom Trump had hoped would vote with the Republicans for his acquittal but who ended up voting to convict.
 Trump tweeted that he was “very surprised & disappointed” with Manchin’s votes, claiming no president had done more for his state. He added that Manchin was “just a puppet” for the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate.
 Sondland was a crucial witness in the House impeachment inquiry, telling investigators￼ that “Everyone was in the loop” on Trump’s desire to press Ukraine for politically charged investigations￼. He told lawmakers how he came to understand that there was a “quid pro quo” ￼connecting a desired White House visit for Ukraine’s leader and an announcement that the country would￼ conduct the investigations the president wanted.
 Sondland “chose to be terminated rather than resign,” according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
 Alexander Vindman’s lawyer issued a one-page statement that accused Trump of taking revenge on his client.
 “He did what any member of our military is charged with doing every day: he followed orders, he obeyed his oath, and he served his country, even when doing so was fraught with danger and personal peril,” Pressman said. “And for that, the most powerful man in the world — buoyed by the silent, the pliable, and the complicit — has decided to exact revenge.”
 The White House did not respond to Pressman’s accusation.
 “We do not comment on personnel matters,” said John Ullyot, spokesman for the National Security Council, the foreign policy arm of the White House where Vindman was an expert on Ukraine.
 Vindman’s status had been uncertain since he testified that he didn’t think it was “proper” for Trump to “demand that a foreign government investigate” former Vice President Joe Biden and his son’s dealings with the energy company Burisma in Ukraine. Vindman’s ouster, however, seemed imminent after Trump mocked him Thursday during his post-acquittal celebration with Republican supporters in the East Room and said Friday that he was not happy with him.
 “You think I’m supposed to be happy with him?” Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. “I’m not. ... They are going to be making that decision.”

The San Diego State graduate also has experienced as an offensive coordinator at Utah (2009) and Fresno State (2012-15). Schramm has coached running backs at Utah (2011 and 2005-08), Texas State (2002), SDSU (1997-01) and Austin Peay (1988).
 “It is great to have Dave here finally,” USU head coach Gary Andersen said during Wednesday’s press conference. “I have been with Dave for a number of years throughout my career and he is exactly what Utah State is all about. He cares about the kids first and has been doing this for a long time. ... He has toughness and grit, and is a tremendous teacher both on and off the field. He coaches the game of football because he wants to, not because he has to, which I think is very important.
 “He wants to be here in this area. He has a boy that plays football at Boise State and has another boy — they are twins — that is playing baseball at the University of Utah, so his ties around here are very important. It is a tremendous family and a tremendous addition to our Aggie Family.”
 Schramm started his collegiate coaching career at Austin Peay, where he was in charge of the running backs and tight ends in 1988. In addition to the aforementioned schools, the former Adams State, Grossmont Junior College and Cornell quarterback has coached at Nebraska (1989) and Montana (2003-04).
 In his career, teams coached by Schramm have made 13 bowl appearances and four trips to the FCS Playoffs. Additionally, Schramm has been a part of eight conference championships during his time as a coach.

However, compared to the Cerato, the on-paper figures are curtailed to 130kW and 265Nm. While the former is down on the CX-30, the latter is healthier – and from lower in the rev range, meaning progress is a little more effortless down low. However, the smaller capacity engine and heavier body (1500kg) means the Seltos is thirster at the bowser, with a combined fuel consumption of 7.6L/100km.

All Brett Brown knew Friday before a 119-107 win over the Memphis Grizzlies was that his Sixers' playing rotation was no longer as firm as he'd expected it to be when the season started. And that well could include, and soon, recasting Horford as a sixth man.
 “It's kind of all on the table,” Brown said. “Probably, that's the most high- profile discussion. When we brought Al in, it was with the idea that we think you can guard Giannis (Antetokounmpo), and we think you can guard (Pascal) Siakam, and all the other stuff Al Horford provides. And there was definitely a playoff portion of, 'Let's reward Al with a contract and get him into our program,' And so as it sits now, where you are trying to find a rhythm beat with 30 games left, it truly is, and I'm not ducking the question, all on the table.”
 As for Friday, Brown left that table set exactly as it had been, even continuing to start Shake Milton after Josh Richardson had been cleared to play.
 Richardson was on a minutes restriction after recovering from a hamstring injury. Neither Burks nor Robinson had yet to report, but both are expected to be available when the Chicago Bulls visit Sunday night at 6.
 The Sixers won in relative comfort, improving to 23-2 at home and easing some of the crisis atmosphere after an 0-4 road swing. Still, Brown is not as committed to a lineup and a rotation as he was earlier.
 “When we break the season down into thirds, for me it is about welcoming our two new players,” Brown said. “J-Rich seemed to be out for what seemed like forever. Joel Embiid was out for what seemed like forever not so long ago. And so you are juggling some stuff. So let's feel some stuff out. Let's get to the All-Star break. Let's play with a level of competitiveness that we are proud of. Then I'll do what I always do. I'll go away. I'll go into seclusion. I'll bunker down and come back a little bit more zoomed in.”
 • • •
 Richardson, who had said he wanted to return before the All-Star break, was cleared just before the game and played 14:57, scoring four points.
 As long as Richardson's availability is limited, Brown will not commit to returning him to the lineup.
 “I'll reverse-engineer it,” the coach said, “so I can finish the game with him and still meet those minutes requirements.”
 Richardson had missed six games with a left hamstring injury.
 • • •
 Furkan Korkmaz scored a career-high 34 points, shooting 13-for-17, including 7-for-9 from deep.
 “It was a good feeling,” Korkmaz said. “The fans, the coaching staff, everybody was involved today. It was a tough week. We got back home. We played hard. And we showed our spirit, which we needed to show.”
 • • •
 As expected, the Sixers waited until after the trade deadline, then made a full commitment to Norvel Pelle.
 Pelle, whose opportunities to play for the Sixers under the terms of his two- way deal had expired, had his pact upgraded after Jonah Bolden was waived.
 “I was ecstatic,” Pelle said. “I was excited. And my parents were there. So that put the icing on the cake. It was like, 'Oh, man.'”
 With a cut-above ability to block shots around the rim, Pelle can be a useful piece in Brett Brown's postseason rotation. Pelle was averaging 2.5 points, 3.6 rebounds and 1.5 blocks in his 14 NBA games while spending most of his time with G-League Delaware.

 She pushes again with the determination of The Little Engine That Could.
 "The only thing left is a decision by politicians … but Alberta alone is held back and put down by the Liberals. The Liberals are turning a national opportunity into a national unity crisis."

Jeff Bley, the South Florence coach who won a state championship while coaching Latta, was proud of his Bruins on Friday for more reasons than getting the win. After he vented his frustration several times this season about his young team not closing out winnable games, they did just that on Friday.
 “Finish, finish, finish,” Bley said. “Yes, we talked about it again tonight.
 But here’s how South Florence on Friday delivered the finish Bley had searched for all season: After losing what at one time was a double-digit lead over West and falling behind 36-34 with less than three minutes left, the Bruins’ strength in will rose to the forefront.
 After a Lashanti Evans layup tied it at 36, Evans took a Knight miss and then drove the length of the court and thrust forth a layup while in coverage that went in.
 At 38-36, Evans’ heroics gave South the lead for good. She finished with a game-high 16 points.
 “I just told them (after West took the lead) that you need to relax,” Bley said. “We’re still not out of it. We still had plenty of time, we’ve got to weather the storm. It was important for them not to let doubt creep into the back of their mind. It was about staying positive at that point and believing we could win this game.”
 Even before South took the court Friday, Bley made that the focus of the Bruins’ pregame talk.
 “I told them if they didn’t believe they could win this game, they didn’t need to be coming out of this locker room,” Bley said. “And they all believed. We believed. I don’t think anybody else believed. But we did, and we got the job done.”
 It was Evans who also set the tone in the first quarter, sinking a 3-pointer at the top of the key and following with a layup to give South a 12-4 lead.
 “I believe that kind of team effort came from the speech,” said Bley, whose team improved to 8-11 overall and 5-4 in Region 6-5A. “They believed we could win. They had that positive mentality while coming out and played hard from the start.”
 Amaura Burgess came to life in the second quarter, helping the Knights back into contention, and teammate Zy’Breayziah Alexander added 10 fourth-quarter points to help make Friday’s game a thriller.

Three more people on a cruise ship off Japan have tested positive for the new coronavirus, bringing the number aboard to 64, the government said Saturday, with passengers facing a two-week quarantine.
 The latest confirmation came a day after an additional 41 passengers were found to have contracted the virus, which has killed hundreds of people, most of them in China, where it has infected more than 30,000 on the mainland.
 Japanese authorities have so far tested about 280 people on board the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined after a former passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong last month, was diagnosed with the virus.
 Test results from six more people were released on Saturday, with three of them confirmed infected, the health ministry said without giving further details such as their nationalities.
 The three people have already been sent to hospital, the ministry said in a statement.
 There were more than 3,700 passengers and crew on the ship when it arrived off Japan's coast on Monday evening. It docked in Yokohama on Thursday to resupply for a quarantine that could last until February 19.
 One of those found infected is in serious condition. Many on board are elderly and at greater risk of developing complications from the virus.
 Testing was initially carried out on those who displayed symptoms or had come into close contact with the former passenger diagnosed.
 \- 'Very, very scary' -
 Japan has already reported at least 25 cases of coronavirus aside from the infections on board the ship, and evacuated hundreds of citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pathogen emerged, including on a fourth flight Friday.
 Passengers on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins to prevent new infections and have expressed confusion and frustration.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) called on Tokyo to provide sufficient support, including mental care, for the passengers and patients.
 "There's a lot to do to support those patients. Not just from the point of view of their physical health but from a mental health perspective," Michael Ryan, head of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva on Friday.
 "It's quite scary, very, very scary to be in that situation," he said. "It's a very stressful situation for those individuals."
 But he also called for calm, saying: "Let's be careful here not to overreact. This is a very close community living in very close quarters."

However, as Ziegler continues, the problem is not necessarily solved in the long term. It is believed that there are still many Mountain West schools wanting to end the Broncos' unique status, and this could lead to another struggle as the end of this new contract is imminent in 2026 and the conference must start a new contract negotiate. But it seems wise to stop the fight for now and say "We're all happy together!" - Put on your face, even if this face may not last forever. There is no need to spend a lot of time and money complaining now and further splitting the conference if there is no actual impact by at least 2027.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Jimmie Johnson has been chasing NASCAR history for so long that his relentless pursuit of rewriting the record books has become part of his legacy.
   
 Johnson, tied with Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt with seven Cup Series titles, has been racing for sole possession of the record since 2017. He made a hashtag for his social media posts — #Chasing8 — and his push to make history has never wavered.
   
 As he heads into his 19th and final full season in stock car racing, Johnson has dropped the motto. He’d love to close his full-time career with a record eighth title, but the 44-year-old Californian said he would rather remove self-inflicted pressure and enjoy his final season in the No. 48 Chevrolet.

The kilowatt count totals a healthy 139, while there’s 252 Newtons available from a rather lofty 4000rpm. The six-speed torque converter auto is proficient, while drive is sent to the front wheels only. Fuel consumption is rated at 6.6L/100km, a marker that is achievable in real- world driving.

 When looking specifically at Georgia Southern (14-10, 8-5 Sun Belt), the uncertainty continues. The Eagles have been on a roller coaster ride from game to game - and oftentimes from half to half. One minute, they look like a squad that should contend for a conference title and NCAA tournament berth.

DETROIT -- Ford will work with Rivian to build Lincoln's first fully electric vehicle, the Dearborn automaker announced Wednesday.
 The news puts some meat on the bones of the $500 million investment Ford is making in the EV startup based in Plymouth Township, west of Detroit. Rivian, which has plans to produce its own electric truck and SUV at its plant in Normal, Ill., also has the backing of online retail and delivery giant Amazon.
 The Lincoln electric luxury vehicle will use Rivian's flexible skateboard platform, the company said. Ford had previously noted that it would work with Rivian on an electric vehicle but had not said it would be a Lincoln.
 "Working with Rivian marks a pivotal point for Lincoln as we move toward a future that includes fully electric vehicles," Lincoln President Joy Falotico said in a news release. "This vehicle will take Quiet Flight (the brand's design theme) to a new place -- zero emissions, effortless performance and connected and intuitive technology. It's going to be stunning."
 Ford noted that the news is part of the company's previously announced $11.5 billion electrification investments, which include the Mustang Mach-E and an electric F-150.
 Interestingly, Rivian revealed to the Free Press last year that it was testing its skateboards, which carry the electric vehicle batteries and components, underneath the bodies of used Ford F-150s on metro Detroit roads.
 "We need something to keep the weather out while we put a lot of miles on our skateboard, so they're driving around in Detroit right now, too. They're all over the place, but nobody knows. We're very quiet about that," Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said at the time.
 He said then that Ford had no corporate connection to the company, but the vehicle wheelbase was the right size for testing.
 Also on Wednesday, the UAW issued a statement from Region 4 Director Ron McInroy about the Lincoln announcement, highlighting the union's expectations regarding the Rivian workforce:
 "There are a lot of skilled and talented workers around Normal, Illinois, who will make for an excellent Rivian workforce and build a world class quality product. Given the UAW's history in Normal and our history with Ford Motor Company, we look forward to these jobs returning and UAW members having the opportunity once again to organize and form their local union which has meant so much to that community. It's a great day for our UAW members, UAW retirees and for the surrounding community."

With all the fanfare planned for Saturday night at the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, the current Aggies will be doing their best to focus on the task at hand.
 The task is getting an opportunity at another Mountain West foe that beat them earlier in the season. Utah State hosts Boise State in a men’s basketball game in what is already a sold out Spectrum. Tipoff is set for 8 o’clock.
 “We are anticipating a great night tomorrow with honoring the teams, coaches and all that stuff,” USU head coach Craig Smith said after practice Friday. “It’s going to be exciting to have all those former players back. And certainly every time the Aggies and Boise State play in basketball, it seems like it comes down to the wire. Certainly that is the case in my two experiences and probably the team that deserved to win didn’t win both times. But that’s basketball and you have to finish the game.”

“We were like, ‘We’re gonna have so many,’” the actor, 39, recently told _Us Weekly_ exclusively on the “Watch With Us” podcast while promoting USA Network’s _Miz & Mrs_. “Now we’re realizing having two is a whole new level of parenthood, realizing you only have a certain amount of time with one and then the other one needs another amount of time. If you go with so many kids, how much time do you really have to show the love and support that you feel they need to be successful in whatever they want to do? So it’s one of those things where we’re like, ‘We’ll see in time.’”

Soft-touch materials, sound ergonomics and a design that looks a class above – it might be plucked out of the current Mazda 3, but the CX-30’s cabin is a welcome place to be. It’s quiet, too, with a high level of refinement and atmosphere. The leathers used are pleasing and there is a reassuring tactility to all the dials and controls. However, there is a but. And that’s in the form of interior space. While the CX-30 is noticeably bigger than its own sibling, the CX-3, the Mazda is outclassed by the Kia in this regard. Leg and toe room are tight, and while the plunging roofline doesn’t cut into headroom as much as you’d think, it is still at a deficit to the Korean. So it’s swings and roundabouts.

Alas, her journey ended alone, according to the Bee. Her body was found in Shasta County in northern California, and her cause of death is currently unknown.
 She came from a famous bloodline, as her father was the first known gray wolf to cross into California since the endangered species was eradicated in the state in the 1920s. Seven years after her father crossed in 2011, OR-54 meandered south of the Oregon-California border after leaving her pack in 2018.
 Ranchers in northern California complained about the lone wolf for years, the Bee reported. But wildlife protectors fought for her, earning gray wolves protected status as an endangered species in California.

 The clock is ticking for farmers.
 March 16 is the last day to make what is likely one of the most important business decisions you will make for your farming operation this year.
 If you have not already visited your local Farm Service Agency (FSA) county office to make your election for either the agriculture risk coverage (ARC) or the price loss coverage (PLC) program and to sign your annual enrollment contract, you should call and make your appointment now.
 Many of you are gearing up to head to the field for spring planting, but I cannot stress enough the importance of not letting this deadline get lost in the hectic day-to-day obligations of farm life.
 If you fail to enroll for 2019 ARC or PLC, you will be ineligible to receive a payment for the 2019 crop year.
 ARC and PLC provide financial protections to farmers from substantial drops in crop prices or revenues and are vital economic safety nets for most American farms. These programs cover 20 commodities produced in the U.S. FSA anticipates more than 1.7 million producers will enroll in ARC or PLC - that's a lot of producers to assist in a short period of time.
 As of Feb. 3, 2020, FSA records in Minnesota show that 8,231 farms out of an expected 95,221 farms have completed ARC or PLC enrollment for the 2019 crop year.
 Want to maximize your time visiting with FSA? Inquire about deadlines and options for also enrolling in 2020 ARC or PLC and updating PLC payment yields. Our staff will help you make the most out of your visit or set you up with a future appointment to help check FSA programs off your lengthy \"to do\" list.
 If you're still unsure about the choice of ARC or PLC, we offer online decision tools to help you determine the best program election for your farming operation. To access these tools, visit the FSA Web site at www.fsa.usda.gov. Call FSA today for an appointment.
 To locate your local FSA office, visit farmers.gov.
 We know that time is money... so make the time to avoid losing the money.

Cockett went on to thank and commend the USU Anti-Racist Solidarity group for its efforts. She encouraged them to lean on one another and the USU Inclusion Center for support, and stated that the group had her support.
 “I am personally committed to fostering an inclusive campus where everyone feels safe and feels that they are an important part of our Aggie family,” Cockett wrote.
 Representatives for the USU Anti-Racist Solidarity Group have declined to comment on this story.
 Miller and Boghossian’s presentation went on as planned and centered on the idea that the culture of “political correctness” at the university keeps students from hearing a full, wide range of ideas, including those they may find offensive. Around 20 people were in attendance.
 “I think these kids are really trying to do the right thing, and I think that their heart is in the right place … this is kind of what you do in your youth, you try to fight for what you think is right, but I think it’s very sadly misguided,” Boghossian said. “These are kids who really feel strongly about an issue, and I actually feel strongly about the same issues. But the conclusions that they have come to are leading them away from the goals they want to achieve.”
 Miller said USU students expressing opposition to the event undermines their own movements.
 “This whole notion of intellectual diversity and free speech is the basis for the letter that they wrote even to be possible,” Miller said. “If they want to cut free speech, they saw off the very branch on which they’re sitting.”
