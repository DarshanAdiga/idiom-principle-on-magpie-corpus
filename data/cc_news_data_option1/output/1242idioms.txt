Di nuovo fuori dal carcere, l'ex re dei paparazzi Fabrizio Corona ha festeggiato ieri sera i suoi 46 anni. Il compleanno non dev'essere stato uno dei migliori, dal momento che l'uomo è costretto a trascorrere questo lungo periodo di quarantena chiuso in casa, ma la sua famiglia ha organizzato per lui una piccola festa. In un video pubblicato ieri sera su Instagram, Corona spegne la candelina su un tiramisù, affiancato dalla moglie Nina Moric e dal figlio. Il video, che ritrae la famiglia sorridente, è accompagnato da una didascalia molto particolare: _" C’è poco da festeggiare. Una soffertissima, piccolissima libertà. C’è poco da festeggiare, in questo momento bisogna pensare agli altri. E io oggi penso e proteggo l’unica famiglia che mi è rimasta, mia moglie e mio figlio. Forza. Andrà tutto bene. Me lo ripeto da tanti anni e oggi lo dico a voi"._

UPS is letting us use their drop- off centres for donations and sewn masks; we're providing masks for any of the drivers for any UPS location that works with us. As our seamstresses finish their masks, they drop them at the UPS location closest to their homes. The masks get delivered to us, and we sort them based on type (with or without pockets for filters) and where they’re headed, and label them to let prospective wearers know they’re not medical-grade protection. We’ve delivered more than 100 masks so far, and now that our delivery system is up and running, that number will rise every day.

The fabric store on our street had to close its doors this week, so the owners gave us a 75 per cent discount on the stock they had left. I’m going to disperse the spools that I have to other sewers. I haven’t made any masks since the first ones I made for my family; it feels like I’ve been on the phone for the last three days straight organizing volunteers and getting UPS on board. Depending on their levels of experience and schedules, some of our sewers can make up to 50 masks in a day. I got a call yesterday morning from a woman who had 60 masks to drop off.

 "We have three," said Parker.
 "That we know about," Broderick added.
 "No, we're sure. We're sure."
 They have two girls - 10-year-old twins - and a 17-year-old son.
 Re any, or all, of them aspiring actors? "It sounds like one of the girls," said Parker. "Yeah. Which is an absolute surprise. But she did clarify that the other day, and said she wants to get her degree in education 'cause she really wants to be a teacher. And I said, 'That's a fine and good idea. And then you can always go to acting school.'"

World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said Sunday that the decision to postpone this year's Tokyo Olympics because of the coronavirus has saved athletes from "mental turmoil".
 Former Olympic champion Coe supported the move to push the Games back to 2021 and said competitors would have been placed in an impossible position if the event had been left to start on July 24 as originally scheduled.
 They would have been tempted to continue training despite large parts of the world being in lockdown due the COVID-19 pandemic, which has now killed more than 31,000 people.
 "We didn't want to have the athletes in a position where they were countering government advice, maybe even breaking the law," Coe told TalkSport on Sunday.
 "And of course in the back of their minds was always that concern, it wasn't just their own training programme, but that they ran the risk of effectively infecting themselves, their families, their kids, grandparents or parents, and we just wanted to take them out of that mental turmoil as quickly as we possibly could.
