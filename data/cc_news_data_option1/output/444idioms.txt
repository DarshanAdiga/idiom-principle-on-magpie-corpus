The mission and the vision of any rational being or organization plays an influential role in determining how far the being or organization will go in life. The mission is basically the modus operandi or steps the being or organization has set out to accomplish a given task, but the vision is the ultimate goal or price they will like to be remembered for posterity. Vision is more important mission because that’s the main area most people or organization looks at to identify the passion and works of any being or corporation. When you have a vision, it will be great to share it to like minds, however, you have to be careful and tactical on the people you share your dream with. This is because little minds might tend to discourage you while articulate minds with biased mindsets may try to steal your ideas. Regardless of how it plays out, go out there and share what you have. People who need and appreciate your idea will come through and people who don’t see light at the end of the tunnel will motivate and inspire you. It is worthy to note that the people who matter don’t care and the people who care don’t matter. Furthermore, you might get many no’s, but all you need is one yes.

It’s an unassailable fact that the only permanent thing in the world is change. As rational beings, remaining static is not in our DNA, everyone desires to grow. It takes courage and confidence to grow in life. Life is a process; take for instance, a newborn child will first of all learn to crawl, walk before he/she can run. The same process is applicable to a student who desires to be a doctor, lawyer, engineer, accountant, president, etc. They will not assume the position overnight, it must follow a process. Even in business, an entrepreneur or a corporation studies the market, makes mistakes and learns from it, and then master the craft in order to reap the fruit of their labour. Amidst all these attributes, one thing is certain, every rational individual or corporation believe the journey they are about to embark upon, they trust the process will come out good.

The most successful people in this world didn’t achieve their goals overnight. They had to learn, understand, repeat, practice, fall, rise up, understand, and most of all, trust the process. The biggest gains in life come from the biggest failures. If you can shift your perspective around what failure is, you are already one step ahead of the game. As Eloise Ristad says, _“When we give ourselves permission to fail, we at the same time give ourselves permission to excel.”_

In order to distinguish yourself, you must have accomplished a great deal of work which can a business, product, artwork, a unique work, skill or even academic feat. All this attribute requires a great deal of perseverance or resilience which adds up on a daily basis before the final feat is accomplished. Without perseverance and resilience, it will be hard to accomplish a task. On a personal note, when I was writing my first book, I was not only determined to succeed, I also made sure my product was outstanding. I was able to it do by dotting the I’s and crossing the t’s in addition to having the best hands to work on the final manuscript before the book was published. The process wasn’t actually easy, but I trusted the process knowing fully well all the setbacks, delays, and disappointments are the price I will have to pay. I was also very optimistic there’ll be light at the end of the tunnel when the books was published. Moral: I trusted the process and it really worked out well.

The Shiromani Akali Dal SAD on Sunday demanded the immediate dismissal of Jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa as well as an independent probe into the Amritsar jailbreaking incident. Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said the Amritsar jailbreak had come in the wake of various other incidents taking place in Punjab jails which had shaken the confidence of the people in the government.He said, Besides ordering an independent probe into the incident, the government should also tell what action it had taken in other such cases and why the jail administration had collapsed. Asking the chief minister to fix accountability at the very top, Dr Cheema said, The Jails minister should be asked to resign immediately till the pendency of the probe.Prison security is the primary responsibility of the Jails minister. He cannot shirk away from this responsibility especially since his role is already under a cloud, he added. Rejecting the magisterial inquiry ordered by the chief minister into the incident, Dr Cheema said a magistrate could not do justice in the case.The magistrate will not be able to probe the role of the Jails minister in weakening prison security. Since this incident has exposed prison security and comes in the wake of the earlier incident of mass uprising in the Ludhiana central jail besides several incidents of use of mobile phones in Jails, it is necessary to hold an independent inquiry into the functioning of Punjab jail administration, he said. The prisoner who escaped have been identified as Vishal, Gurpreet and Jarnail. Vishal is accused in a rape case registered last year, while Gurpreet and Jarnail, who were brothers, were jailed for snatching.Giving details on the escape, DGP Dinkar Gupta said the men apparently made a hole in the wall of their barrack by removing about 10 bricks. Vishals brother Gaurav, also in the same barrack, chose not to flee with them, said the DGP. ANI
