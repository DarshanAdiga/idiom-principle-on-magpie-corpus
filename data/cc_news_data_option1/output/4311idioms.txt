Il presidente Acquaroli - sottolinea il capogruppo dem - ha dichiarato che non avrebbe mai pensato di iniziare in questo clima di emergenza. Francamente sono parole sconcertanti e che ci preoccupano non poco, perche danno l'impressione di un esecutivo regionale senza idee e in balia degli eventi. Che i mesi autunnali avrebbero rappresentato una fase difficile e delicatissima dal punto di vista sociale era noto a tutti. Anche per questo avevamo presentato durante l'estate un piano shock per i primi 100 giorni di governo, volto a contenere la pandemia, a tutelare imprese e lavoratori, e a proteggere le famiglie e le fasce piu deboli della popolazione. La destra, invece, ha fatto credere per mesi che la questione del Covid potesse essere affrontata con soluzioni facili e semplicissime da attuare. Ora, alla prova dei fatti, quella faciloneria va inevitabilmente ad alimentare una confusione politica che rischia di essere pagata a caro prezzo dai marchigiani. Non e certo un caso che l'unica intenzione palesata dalla giunta sia stata quella di ricorrere al tanto vituperato Covid Hospital di Civitanova, contro il quale hanno costituito la loro campagna elettorale. In ogni caso noi siamo pronti a dare responsabilmente il nostro contributo. In questo momento, il bisogno primario e potenziare immediatamente la medicina del territorio, sulla scia di quanto avviato a primavera durante la prima ondata della pandemia. A partire dal raddoppio delle Usca e dal rafforzamento dell'assistenza a domicilio tramite equipe di medici e infermieri, e necessario programmare e investire risorse per evitare di mettere nuovamente sotto pressione le strutture ospedaliere e dare ai pazienti un servizio efficace direttamente nelle loro abitazioni. Sono proposte che vogliamo discutere al piu presto e per questo chiediamo al presidente Acquaroli e alla sua giunta di non perdere altro tempo e di venire in consiglio per riferire come intende affrontare concretamente la recrudescenza dei contagi di Covid-19».

More than 10,000 Polk County voters have already cast their ballots in the Nov. 3 general election, and local officials are preparing for a final surge before early voting ends.
 Polk County Elections Coordinator Brande Coggins said they expect crowd levels to pick up toward the end of this week as voters try to take advantage of early voting in Georgia, which runs through Friday.
 The second week of early voting in Polk County saw fewer lines and fewer voters make their way to the county’s two polling stations.
 The county office of elections and registration reported 3,346 votes were cast in person from Oct. 19 through Oct. 24, about 1,200 less than the record- setting pace of the first full week of early voting.
 That is still an average of about 558 voters per day, with minimal lines and wait times according to Coggins. In comparison, the daily average for the first week of early voting was around 911.
 Last week was capped off by the state’s lone Saturday of early voting, where Polk County had 446 total ballots cast in person, a number Coggins said was a very good turnout for a Saturday. She added Saturdays during past early voting periods had seen only around 100 ballots cast on average in Polk County.
 In total, 7,899 in-person ballots had been cast in Polk County as of Saturday evening. Add the total number of absentee ballots received by the elections office, and that number jumps to 10,100.
 Coggins said they continue to encourage voters to vote early or by absentee ballot to help cut down on any large crowds on election day. She also said they are seeing voters not waste any time when coming to the polls.
 “Our voters are coming in informed. They have reviewed sample ballots and taken time to review the amendments that are on the ballot. They pretty much have their minds made up when they come in and that has helped tremendously,” Coggins said.
 “Also, with the new equipment we have this year, we’re seeing voters who have not used them picking up on it and are liking it. I think that will help our lines and our workers on election day.”
 Early voting is available Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Thursday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. at both the Polk County Elections Office, 144 West Ave., in Cedartown, and the Rockmart Community Center, 436 Hogue Ave.

Ugly doesn't really sum up South Carolina's 52-24 loss to LSU.
 Gruesome is probably more apt. Allowing 31 points in the first half and 45 points in the first 44 minutes is a problem if the offense isn't just rolling. It wasn't on Saturday.
 The only silver lining for the Gamecocks is that no matter how bad a loss is, it still only counts as one loss in the standings. Any one game can be flushed, and South Carolina's coming road offers some opportunities, even coming off an emotional lost chance of sorts.
 "We're going to go Tuesday, we're going to practice against each other hard," linebacker Ernest Jones said. "We're going to go out there and compete with each other and learn form this one and try an keep it moving and get ready for A&M."
 Most cold-eyed realists at season's start would have said that getting to the open week at 2-3 would've been a net positive. Auburn, LSU and Florida all appeared to be games when the Gamecocks would be underdogs by eight points or more, so extra weight was placed on that opener against Tennessee. After those first five, things were going to open up a bit.

You could be based at Windsor Castle, with roughly 1,000 rooms and 484,000 square feet, or at the Queen ’s lavish London home of Buckingham Palace.
 The housekeeper will also get to travel to a variety of other royal homes for around three months of the year to undertake work there.
