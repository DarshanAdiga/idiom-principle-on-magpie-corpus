Chocolate, chicken, cheese and crab and I could only choose one. (Coffee didn't even make the short list.) Try it yourself. What would you pick if you could choose just item for each letter?

Designed by a flight attendant and named the British Invention of the Year in 2012, this pillow doesn't look anything like other travel pillows and that's part of why it's so good. It comes in a J-shape (hence the name), and the hook of J is used to support your chin and keep your head from falling forward, while the rest provides support for your head to lean against. Another perk to the J-Pillow? It's incredibly soft to the touch, too.

In Orange County, suicides were trending down for the year before the pandemic hit, according to data from the Medical Examiner’s office.
 But Orange Sheriff John Mina echoed Lemma’s concerns and said he is focusing on prevention.
 “There is anxiety with self isolation,” Mina said. “I think the biggest thing is not knowing what’s next, when things are going to get better, and what will everything look like once it does get better.”
 Mina said his agency plans to expand its crisis intervention training to more deputies. The agency also plans “to embed” counselors with deputies when they respond to a call of an attempted suicide.
 The idea, he said, is to bring more resources to the people who need them and “deescalate the situation.”
 Mental health experts often say suicide is a permanent treatment to a temporary problem. As difficult as life may be right now, there is help available and there are ways to cope and make things better.

 With a view to make it easier to do business, the government has provided that notification of a discovery and tests to confirm them will not require approval and documents will be accepted on self-certification basis, according to the notification issued on April 25.
 Work programme and field development plan or their revisions will be deemed to be approved on expiry of 30 days of submission of documents under self- certification. Only issues requiring government nod will be grant of petroleum exploration or mining license, transfer of stake and extensions.

 "We are at a delicate and dangerous stage and we need to make sure that the next steps are sure-footed," Raab told Sky news, adding that the government was "doing the homework" behind closed doors on what would happen in the next phase. "It's not responsible to start speculating about the individual measures," he said, urging the public to stick to the current guidance, which is to stay at home except for essential travel.

NEW YORK (AP) — In a manic week full of previously unthinkable market moves, Wall Street ended Friday with one reminiscent of what things were like before the coronavirus outbreak upended everything.
 The S&P 500 glided to a gain of 1.4%, with Apple, Microsoft and other technology stocks leading the way, as they did so many times before the economy shut down in hopes of slowing the spread of the outbreak. The bond market was quiet, while crude prices climbed again.
 The gains offered a soothing coda for a wild week, which began with Monday’s astonishing plummet for oil and carried through Thursday’s sudden disappearance of a morning stock rally, as markets pinballed from fear to hope and back again.
 “The market sort of feels like Dorothy coming to the crossroads and has yet to meet the scarecrow to tell her which way to go,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
 The S&P 500 still lost 1.3% for the week as worries about the economic damage dealt by the coronavirus outbreak outweighed hopes that businesses could soon reopen. That snapped the first two-week winning streak for the S&P 500 since it began selling off in February.
 Reports piled higher through the week showing the pandemic is bludgeoning the economy more than economists had feared. Roughly one in six U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits over the last five weeks.
 The damage is so severe that a heavily divided Congress has reached bipartisan agreement on massive support for the economy. President Donald Trump signed a bill Friday to provide nearly $500 billion more, including loans for small businesses and aid for hospitals.
 The big question for markets is when the economy can reopen, said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management. Businesses can get by for a few months on government help, he said, but if the shutdown drags on longer, they could be permanently damaged.
 Many investors have essentially agreed to swallow horrific corporate profits and economic data in upcoming months, and they’re turning their focus to who can survive and eventually grow profits in the future.
 Next week will be one of the busiest of this earnings season, with more than 150 companies in the S&P 500 reporting how much they made during the first three months of the year. Many companies have been pulling their profit forecasts entirely for 2020 given all the uncertainty, and Wall Street is slashing its own estimates.
 “I don’t really think that’s added to the concern of investors because they assume that companies will be doing a lot of writing down in this bad year so that 2021 could look even better,” said CFRA’s Stovall.

PLYMOUTH - Just one acknowledgement of an up until then hidden talent helped send this week's 50-for-50 profile Dan Gordon down the road to a hall of fame track and field career.
 "I tried different sports as a kid but there was no real connection with any of them. But I remember running the mile in elementary school and the phys. ed teacher (Paul Coffin) told me afterwards that I had a pretty good time," remembered Dan. "That seemed to stick with me and my love of distance running took off from there. It started a fire inside of me."
 Turns out Coffin knew whereof he spoke. A 2018 inductee into the Plymouth Athletic Hall of Fame, coincidentally the same year Coffin was inducted, Gordon is one of the top distance runners in Plymouth North history and the Class of 2011 graduate still holds several individual and relay school records.
 "People know about Dan's talent as a runner, but the thing everyone might not have seen was the incredible competitive fire that was inside of him. He was an intense competitor and that fire fueled him in every race he ran," Blue Eagles Head Coach John Laverty said. "Dan is a fine gentlemen and a great person who I consider to be a close friend, but he absolutely hates to lose at anything.
 "He'd get a look in his eye on race day that said there was no way you were going to beat him to the finish line. Dan had that real eye of the tiger inside of him."
 In his 12 seasons with Plymouth North's cross country and track and field programs, there weren't many times where Gordon wasn't the first runner to come across the finish line. He was a three-time state champion, twice in the spring and once in the winter.
 "Distance running is not easy, but it was something that I grew to love to do. I loved putting in the work you had to do to get better," Dan said. "John Laverty is still an amazing mentor for me who was able to show me so many little things to improve my running. I also had great teammates like Justin Bowman and Jack Lapsley that helped push me along the way as I strove to become a better runner.
 "People think of running as an individual sport, but I always loved the team aspect of being a part of a track and field program. I never wanted to let my teammates down and I think that pushed me to train a little harder and run a little bit faster," Gordon said. "It was so much more enjoyable for me to run as part of a team that when you do it as an individual. Running on your own is like having a Christmas tree with no decorations on it."
 Success followed Gordon from Plymouth North to Stonehill College, where he graduated in 2015 with a degree in English and a minor in Journalism. A team captain as a junior and a senior, Gordon continued to be a team leader both on and off of the race course.
 Gordon qualified for the NCAA Div. II national championship four times as a member of the Skyhawks. He was also a multiple-time selection to the NE-10 All Conference team as well as the NCAA All-East conference squad.
 "Stonehill was the prefect fit for me," Gordon explained. "I wanted to get a great education and still compete at a high level and I was able to get both of those things."
 He still helps out the Skyhawks program as an assistant coach, a spot he's held for the last two years.
 "(Stonehill Track and Field Head Coach) Karen Boen is a nationally recognized coach and an incredible leader. I still learn new things from her each week," Gordon said. "I'm still developing what kind of a coach I want to be and I'm there to help out wherever they need me."
 Gordon, now 27, teaches English at Milford High School and you can still find him out running the roads for multiple miles each week.
 "I've been getting in competitive running shape recently," said Dan, who was going to run in the Boston Marathon earlier this month before the race was postponed until September. "I've qualified for the Chicago Marathon so I might end up running that race."
 Each week during 2020, the 50-for-50 project will profile a Plymouth person or state championship team that positively impacted the town in the last 50 years. To nominate someone, email Sports Editor David Wolcott Jr. at dwolcott@wickedlocal.com with information on the nominee.

Drone images of mass burials have circulated internationally, emblems of dread at the power of this disease to lay modern societies low. To reassure those horrified by the sight of inmates wedging boxed corpses into muddy trenches, officials explained that this was the city’s pre-pandemic norm. Nevertheless, after 150 years of using jail labor to bury a million New Yorkers, the city abruptly hired contract workers in protective suits for the grim task, instead of prisoners dressed chain-gang style.
 This could be a pivotal moment in the long struggle to transform Hart Island. But real change requires an unsparing confrontation of its inequities, not normalization.
 Whose loved ones wind up in these anonymous common graves?
 The same people hardest-hit by the virus — poor, black, old and immigrant New Yorkers — also find it harder than ever to scrape up funeral costs, which average $8,000, even without a formal service. The same underpaid cashiers, cleaners and delivery workers now hailed as “essential” are at increasing risk of being stacked three-deep with 150 strangers.
 As pandemic deaths have mounted, faced with overflowing morgues, the city has increased Hart Island burials five-fold. The grace period to claim a body has been cut to two weeks from 30 days, even as many funeral homes and crematories are too backlogged to offer timely private alternatives.
 Long before the pandemic, hospitals and nursing homes had spotty records of notifying relatives about a death, pointing people toward pre-paid funeral funds, or even correctly tagging bodies. Now, these overwhelmed institutions are even more likely to fall short, just when quarantined or ailing families are hard-pressed even to track the whereabouts of a dying grandmother.
 Officials skirt the issue by calling hurried interments “temporary burials” that can be undone — a concept first pushed in 2014 after medical examiner scandals over bodies lost, mixed up or mistakenly consigned to Hart Island when they were entitled to a veterans cemetery.
 At best, the term “temporary” obscures the grim realities of digging up corpses after months or years from an island where storms leave skulls scattered on eroded shorelines. It omits the difficulties, delays and expense involved, and glosses over a process that requires reshuffling the remains of others.

“A lot of these kids had plans to do all these cool things, all these great, academic things, and now they can’t,” Bonfini said. “They already had their spring semester disrupted, and now they’re going to have their summer semester disrupted.”
 College students who have mental health disorders are facing exacerbated symptoms from the pandemic, she said. Students with anxiety have another layer of anxiety. Students with obsessive-compulsive disorder are scared to leave the house. Students with depression are becoming more withdrawn, with social ties cut.
 Some students are scared for their parents who work in the medical field. Others have parents who have been laid off work, and they’re burdened by the knowledge that their presence gives their families an extra mouth to feed. Many students are facing their own financial hardships with job layoffs and costs for school supplies. Few of them will receive stimulus checks because they are considered dependents.
 Others returned to a tumultuous home life that they had no time to mentally prepare to re-enter. Some face psychological abuse at home, or their parents struggle with alcoholism and addiction.
 “What ends up happening is my students go home and they start taking care of mom and dad and start being the model child. They step into this role where they have to be the adult in the family,” she said.
 Many students have had to seek out privacy for their appointments, taking telehealth phone calls from a car or other secure location. Some students face an identity conflict returning home.
 “I have a student who has not come out of the closet, so they’re leaving their significant other and also their identity,” she said.
 Many young adults rely strongly on their social ties, which were cut off completely and unexpectedly. Graduating students were told their diplomas will be mailed, and many missed their chance to even say goodbye to friends. The isolation can compound depression, and many students are spending more time on their phones reading information about COVID-19 that may be untrue and adding to anxiety.
 Dr. Justin Hackett, associate professor in Cal U’s psychology department, said many of his students have reached out to him about the challenges they are facing.

In the past few years, China has stepped up military aggression and has created artificial islands for military and economic purposes in the South China Sea, drawing criticism from neighbouring countries and other western powers. A few weeks ago, Vietnam had lodged a complaint at the UN stating that China had illegally sunk a fishing trawler near Paracel Islands, killing eight people on board. In March, China built two research stations on territory claimed by the Philippines.

The sight of a vegetable garden in full bloom—jam-packed with delicious, nutritious foods—is a sight to behold.
 Juicy red tomatoes. Vine-ripened green beans. Luscious yellow peppers. Glistening white onions. Collectively, this tasty rainbow has the potential to make your wildest culinary dreams come true.
 But before you can reap from this succulent bounty, you’re gonna to have to get your hands dirty.
 No worries. According to two respected names in the local growing game, now is the perfect time for those with a passing interest in gardening to actually dig in and create their own edible oases.
 “This might be a watershed moment for people getting reconnected not only with their own landscapes but also with growing their own food,” said horticulturist Mark Dwyer, owner of Landscape Prescriptions by MD in Janesville. “There is definitely a renewed interest, and seed sales have exploded—particularly for vegetables.”
 One reason, obviously, is the onset of COVID-19, which has secluded people from such simple public outings as regular trips to the grocery store. And with safer-at-home and social distancing rules in place, more and more people are seeking solitary methods for filling a sudden abundance of time.
 Gardening checks the boxes on both counts.
 “It isn’t as though there is a run on produce at the grocery stores, but I think there is a trio of concerns that includes having to go out, food safety and convenience,” Dwyer said. “There’s nothing better than fresh in lieu of something that is days old at the grocery store, and with all the coronavirus concerns, having a produce section in your backyard might be appealing to people, even if they have to put more work into it.”
 Michael Jesiolowski, horticulture director at Rotary Botanical Gardens in Janesville, also sees the current world situation as an ideal opportunity for people to slow down and commune with the earth.
 “We have all this technology, which is more immediate, and I think gardening is kind of on the other side of the spectrum,” he said. “With gardening, you’re nurturing a seed or seedling, and you’re going to have a pretty long growing season for some vegetables.
 “Gardening is a great way to exercise the ‘patience muscle’ in your life because you need that patience to see these plants through.”
 Gardeners often tout the psychological and physical benefits that come with tending their beds. With the added stress of the new coronavirus, that added escape is a welcome diversion.
 “Right now, in this unsettled, chaotic world, gardening and working with plants brings a lot of things to life,” Jesiolowski said. “It brings a sense of peace, working with the land and getting to be outside. You hear the birds sing; you see colors, and you smell the fragrance of the plants. It’s a very calming sensation.”
 For those who keep things simple—maybe just a few planters or boxes and limited crops—there might also be some financial perks. Unless you’re planning to plant enough produce to feed the neighborhood, you can likely get by with some seeds or plants, a few gardening tools, some soil and soil enhancers, fertilizer and a nearby water source.
 “If you are starting out or hesitant, and maybe don’t want to invest a lot of money in mature plants that might be $10 or $20 each, start out with seeds,” Jesiolowski said. “There is plenty you can do with a packet of seeds, and that is a very low commitment level for beginners.”
 Dwyer said it also makes sense for beginners to be selective in their initial garden designs, particularly if saving money is important.
 “Grow what you like and what you’ll eat. If you don’t like eggplant, don’t grow it,” he said. “The right approach is to grow the vegetables that tend to be more expensive (at grocery stores). Tomatoes and bell peppers tend to be fairly expensive. Dedicate space in your garden to plant crops that will save money and provide convenience.”
 One of the most critical aspects to successful gardening here in southern Wisconsin, which is Zone 5 of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Plant Hardiness Map, is understanding the growing seasons. Though some crops would have required seeds be started a few weeks ago, both Dwyer and Jesiolowski stress there is still time to get things going for this year.
 “It is absolutely not too late,” Dwyer said. “We are in the cool season here toward the end of April, so consider plants like lettuce, radishes and spinach that don’t mind cooler days and nights. But time is coming where you need to start tomato and pepper seeds inside, because they are going to need about six weeks inside to grow before you set them out.”
 And don’t forget to include the kids in the process.
 “(Gardening) is a great family activity,” he said. “My daughters had their own little garden spaces, and we let them pick their own seed packets. With kids, the tomato they grow, pick and taste themselves will be the best tomato they have ever had. That’s just the way it goes.”
 Most important, don’t get discouraged. Gardening takes time and persistence, and even the professionals admit they don’t always get it right.
 “Everyone has to start somewhere,” Jesiolowski said. “If I take a look at some of my first gardens, I would cringe at some of those pictures. But I would also say don’t be afraid to give it a try and take a risk. You’re going to lose plants. I still lose plants to this day. You can use that as a learning experience.
 “If you have the desire, and if growing plants is appealing to you, I would encourage you to at least dip your toe in the water. You might like it a lot.”

 “Right now we have 34 positions — three are temporary and the rest are permanent,” she said during a telephone interview this week, adding the facility has already brought on 13 temporary employees.
 “The temporary employees have the opportunity to apply for permanent status once they are on board,” Donna Yarnell, deputy associate director patient care services at the Coatesville VA Medical Center added.
 The Coatesville VA facility, with approximately 1,235 employees, is one of 150 VA medical centers nationwide. The medical center and its outpatient clinics in Spring City and Newtown Square, offer urgent care, primary care, specialty care, mental health care, long term care, pharmacy and supportive services to outpatients, inpatients and residential patients, according to the center’s website.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said India's "people-driven" battle against COVID-19 is the only way for the country to overcome the pandemic, and asked people to shun any complacency that they will not be infected by the coronavirus because it has so far not affected the places where they live or work. In his monthly 'Mann ki Baat' broadcast, Modi said the country is in the middle of a 'yudh' (war) and asserted that people have to continue being careful and take precautions.
 His note of caution comes against the backdrop of the Union government and states relaxing lockdown norms to revive economic activities. "I urge you not to get overconfident. You should in your over-enthusiasm not think that if the coronavirus has not yet reached your city, village, street or office, it is not going to reach now. Never make such a mistake. The experience of the world tells us a lot in this regard," he said. Modi referred to a popular Hindi idiom 'Sawdhani hati, durghatna ghati' (accident happens when caution is lowered) to make his point. In his 30-minute address, Modi hailed states, emergency workers and civil society groups for their contribution in combating the pandemic, and said that the resolve shown by the people of the country has led to the beginning of a transformation with businesses, offices, educational institutions, medical sector rapidly undergoing new changes.
 With the country under a lockdown since March 24 midnight, he said India's people-driven battle against the pandemic will be discussed when the world discusses the crisis later. "India's fight against the coronavirus is people- driven in the truest sense of the term. Along with people, government and administration are fighting it as well... This is the only way we can win over the virus," he said. Citing a Sanskrit shloka, he said. "Fire, debt and illness, if taken lightly, grow again at the first opportunity, assuming dangerous proportions, so it is important to treat them completely. Therefore, in over-enthusiasm, there should be no negligence. We will always have to remain cautious." Lauding the contribution of people in terms of helping the poor with food and medicines, he likened the exercise with 'mahayagya' in which everybody is eager to contribute. "We are fortunate that today the whole country, each and every citizen of the country, every person is a soldier in this battle and also leading the battle," he said. India's decision to export medicines needed by several countries, including developed nations, has earned it praise from world leaders, Modi said, noting that it did so as part of its ethos.
 The prime minister said wearing masks will now become a part of a civilised society and also exhorted people to stop spitting in public places, saying it was high time to get rid of this "bad habit" once and for all. This will not only boost our basic hygiene standards but also help in preventing the spread of the coronavirus infection, he said. The health crisis, Modi said, has made the world pay special attention to Indian heritage of yoga and ayurveda as people look to them to boost their immunity.
 Modi expressed confidence that the world will acknowledge the significance of India's traditional medicine system in a similar way it adopted yoga, and lamented that hundreds of years of foreign rule have resulted in Indians failing to realise their own strengths. Everyone in this battle is putting up a fight as per one's capacity and ability, and altruism has gained in strength in recent years, Modi said, asserting that he bowed to this sentiment. He asked people to join 'covidwarriors.gov.in', a digital platform that links volunteers, health professionals, representatives of civil society and local administration with each other to take care of relief works. Over 1.25 crore people are already part of this portal, he said.
 Airlines have clocked a distance of over three lakh km under "Lifeline Udan" project to deliver over five hundred tons of medical supplies to different parts of the country, while the railways has been running more than 100 parcel trains on close to 60 routes, Modi added. He also greeted people on Akshaya- Tritiya and noted that holy month of Ramzan had also begun.
 "We should pray more than ever before so that prior to the celebration of Eid the world is rid of the coronavirus and we celebrate Eid with enthusiasm and gaiety like earlier times," Modi said, urging people to adhere to guidelines of local administration. The pandemic, he noted, has changed the manner of celebrating festivals all over the world, including in India. People recently observed many festivals such as Bihu, Baisakhi, Puthandu, Vishu and Odia new year while staying indoors, he said.
 The fight against the epidemic has also given people a fresh perspective to look at the world around them with the importance of sanitary workers and neighbourhood shopkeepers being realised like never before, he said. People used to think negatively of police but a humane and sensitive aspect of policing has manifested itself now as uniformed personnel has been helping those in need, he added. The prime minister hoped that there may be some good news in the fight against the coronavirus during his next 'Mann ki Baat' episode, usually the last Sunday of every month. He reiterated his advice to people to maintain a distance of two yards from each other to keep healthy.
 "Maintain a distance of two yards and keep yourself healthy. 'Do gaz doori, bahut hai zaroori'," he said..

 'Liberate' protesters put others at risk
   
 Excerpted from the Star Tribune of Minneapolis
   
 In an instantly iconic image of the coronavirus pandemic, a man in scrubs blocked the path of a pickup truck taking part in an open-the-economy rally in Denver. The man, who later identified himself as a health care worker, stood stoic while a woman on the passenger side of the truck, wearing a USA T-shirt, waved a handmade sign that read "LAND OF THE FREE."
   
 The message was misdirected. The freedom the nation most needs now is from the spread of COVID-19 and a collapsing economy. That will only happen if government-mandated mitigation efforts are successful in keeping the coronavirus from overwhelming the health care system.
   
 Protesters seem to interpret freedom as the right to recklessly endanger others and jeopardize the progress the nation has made through social distancing. Americans should be allowed to come together and exercise their free speech rights, but they deserve rebuke when their actions threaten the health of others.
   
 The pandemic response should not be a partisan issue. The virus is apolitical, and red and blue states alike are desperate to restart their economies. But scientific data _ not demonstrations that put more Americans at risk _ should drive the decisions.
   
 Health care workers like those who took a stand in Denver are among those front-line workers who most view as heroes. The least Americans can do is to honor them by letting reason guide us through this crisis.

 Charleston faces existential choice on protecting peninsula
   
 Excerpted from The Post & Courier of Charleston, S.C.
   
 It might be the most important decision the city of Charleston will make in the first half of the 21st century. It certainly promises to be the single most expensive one.
   
 For more than a year, the Army Corps of Engineers has worked on a $3 million study of a proposed barrier that would protect the city's peninsula from sea level rise and storm surges.
   
 The plan recommends a protective wall around the peninsula. It would include new pumps, since a wall built to keep out waves can keep rainfall in. And it would include a structure, likely a rocky barrier, to reduce the severity of the strongest inbound waves.
   
 And it would come with an enormous price tag, north of $1.5 billion, of which the federal government would pay 65%. The city would be responsible for the other $525 million.
   
 It's too soon to conclude if this is something the city ought to pursue, but it's urgent that a broad, inclusive public discussion begin because a decision could come as early as next year. At this point, we're less focused on a yes or a no than on whether the ultimate decision will be embraced by the whole city -- and beyond.
   
 There is much to think about. First, the barrier or sea wall would change how this beautiful, historic city greets the water around it. The city's existing High Battery would need to be raised by about another 3 feet; other parts of the barrier would be far taller than what exists.
   
 Then there's the staggering sum. A few years ago, the city estimated it needed $2 billion to meet its drainage needs, and some of that figure included improving its barriers against storms -- but nowhere near the $500-million- plus the city would spend on this. The Corps' math shows the expense would be worth it because of the peninsula's vital role as far as government, health care and higher education as well as the values of the properties at stake. But the city is unlikely to be able to foot its share without significant help from the county and state.
   
 At this point, it's probably easier to find reasons not to move forward -- the wall would be too ugly, too expensive, too limited a solution for our region -- but at the same time, the climate is changing, seas are rising, and the city's long-term survival is at stake. It's crucial that the public gets involved in making this existential decision.
   
 GEORGIA
   
 Lawmakers must stay engaged, ready
   
 Excerpted from The Valdosta Daily Times
   
 While the Georgia General Assembly suspended the 2020 legislative session and sent lawmakers back to their districts, that does not mean they stopped being state representatives and senators during the suspension.
   
 The women and men we have elected to represent us must not act as if they are on furlough from their public duties.
   
 They should be talking to the people in their respective districts -- and they should still be engaged in the legislative process, as much as possible.
   
 In much the same ways that the private sector has learned to make accommodations, use technology for remote conferencing and spend more time on the telephone, lawmakers can -- and should -- continue doing the people's business while sheltering in place.
   
 Suspending the legislative session itself, was the right thing to do for the health and safety of lawmakers and to set the right tone and example for the state of Georgia.
   
 There are still several pieces of legislation up in the air, several difficult and important votes to be taken and eventually the General Assembly will reconvene. When that happens, every representative and senator should be fully prepared and ready to get down to business -- the people's business.

X-Backend-State: Backend up and running

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina’s deadliest tornado outbreak in 36 years now also includes the strongest twister to hit the state since 1995.
 The April 13 tornado that killed five people in Hampton County was upgraded to an EF-4 twister with winds estimated at 175 mph, according to a report issued Friday by the National Weather Service in Charleston.
 Meteorologists said they further studied the damage to a two-story home whose roof and nearly all walls were demolished and spread through a yard, and after consulting with outside experts, decided to upgrade the tornado.
 EF-4 is one step below an EF-5 tornado, which is the strongest recorded. South Carolina has never had an EF-5 tornado.
 The Hampton County storm was only the 11th EF-4 tornado in the state since 1950 and the first twister that powerful since a November 1995 tornado in Marion County.
 The 1995 tornado destroyed the sanctuary at Pleasant Grove Baptist Church near Galivants Ferry. The church bell was found 400 yards away.

WARREN, Susan Norman Susan Ann Norman was born on December 11, 1942 to Clarence and Dorothy Norman in Vandalia, Illinois. She was the youngest of six children with four brothers and one sister. She was raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Houston, Texas. She graduated from Bellaire High School and Tulsa University where she received her bachelor's of education degree. She met her husband Donald H. Warren while teaching junior high science in Houston, Texas. They were married on June 25, 1966. They enjoyed a few years as empty nesters until welcoming their first child, Diana, into the world in 1970. A few years later, in 1974, her son, David was born. Susan took a break from working to stay home with her children for several years. As a stay at home mom, she was very active making creative projects such as ceramics, sewing her children clothes and costumes, baking and cooking, and anything else that sparked their/her imagination. She also volunteered in their many activities. Once David went to kindergarten Susan decided to return to the work force and sold nuts and bolts along the Houston ship channel to Oil companies. While Houston was her and Don's home most of their lives, they wanted a change and decided to move to Austin in 1983. After settling in Austin, Susan went back to teaching middle school science at Hill Country Middle School, putting her whole heart into her work. While there, she won the Spirit of Education award for the Eanes School District. As her children matured and moved up in grades, Susan, coincidentally, followed their path to new places. She started teaching high school science at Westlake High School and inspired many students well past their college years. Once her own children were in college, Susan was ready for a new challenge and decided to quit teaching and pursue a career in nursing. She went back to school and earned a Masters of Nursing degree from UT Austin. Her caring and compassion was evident by her willingness to work at hospice with terminally ill patients as well as working as a floor nurse at the old Brackenridge hospital. Her experience in nursing led her to new opportunities advocating for the well-being of people and she eventually became the head of Safe Kids Traffic Safety program for TxDot. She loved helping families with their car seat installations and that experience prepared her for her next great role in life, grandparent. Her daughter, Diana, and her husband Jimmy, welcomed their daughter Robin in 2000. Two more grandchildren would follow: Drew in 2003 to Diana and family, and in 2006 Lyndon to David and family. Susan retired from TxDot in 2009 to enjoy her golden years with her family. Retirement did not slow Susan down one bit. She welcomed her local grandkids over for regular Friday night sleepovers for many years at their Grammy & Granddaddy's house. She also volunteered at their school, Mills elementary and at Austin Pets Alive. In addition, she took up kayaking and made new friends with her outdoor activities which also included hiking and birdwatching. In addition to loving the beauty Austin had to offer, Susan's other place near and dear to her heart was Estes Park, Colorado. She and Don started going there in 1967. They continued the tradition with their children and grandchildren for the remainder of her life. She LOVED hiking, seeing the wildlife and scenery, and everything else the area had to offer. It was always presumed that she would live well into her 90's because of her positive outlook and physical health. Unfortunately she was diagnosed with dementia in her 70's and battled the disease for several years until her peaceful passing. She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Don, her daughter Diana and her family, and son David and his family. In lieu of flowers, her family requests donations in her honor to the Age of Central Texas for their wonderful programs she benefited from during her later years.

Our reach may be local but not the effort in aiding the fight against COVID-19, say several community radio station managers who are operating with limited resources and broadcasting shows with a local touch like "Break the fake news chain" and "Panchtantra ka Corona mantra". Local initiatives matter the most to check the deadly virus spread, according to station managers of few Community Radios (CR), either located in university campuses or in far- flung districts and remote corners of country. According to Vinod Pavarala, UNESCO chair on community media, the role of CR stations is important as the vulnerable sections of the population need credible information in their local language on how they can protect themselves against coronavirus.
 "At a time when there is a mass spread of wrong information, it is even more challenging to break the chain not only of the virus but of the fake news as well. We have a show called 'Break the fake news chain' and we receive calls from housewives to rickshaw pullers about whether so and so Whatsapp message's claim is correct or not," said Surinder Singh Banolta, manager at a university community radio in Shimla. Pinki Chandran, Station Director of Bangalore's Radio Active CR 90.4 MHz, told PTI, "We have been working on a series of programmes since March including official updates from different government departments, programmes on health- with special focus on mental health, dealing alcohol withdrawal, spotlight on the various different initiatives by individuals and NGOs, appeals on understanding facts and importance of fighting misinformation besides community testimonies" "This is happening because community reporters, producers and volunteers are on the frontline, acting as responders in bringing out information. It is a mix of problem- focused reporting and solutions showing possibilities. The everyday reporting is allowing communities to highlight their neighbourhoods and issues," she said.
 Amity University's Community Radio station is running a programme called "Panchtantra ka corona matra" where different stories from Panchtantra tales are being used to convey messages related to coronavirus. "The stories from the Panchtantra have been converted into messages for how to fight against coronavirus.We have produced different programmes for farmers, on social distancing, avoiding rumour mongering and measures that need to be taken at home beyond handwashing and sanitising, " she told PTI.
 Jadavpur University's 'JU Radio' has shifted its programming to digital mode where different volunteers are being connected through phone while the station is being operated with minimum staff. "We encouraged listeners to do a 5-minute audio recording which is uploaded on our YouTube, Facebook page so that it can be seen by authorities concerned for taking follow up measures. We also provide inputs about drug stores and delivery of essential services which help a lot of people in a particular locality," a varsity official said. "Alfaz-e-Mewat FM 107.8" operational in Haryana's Nuh district, caters to 225 villages and is focusing on broadcasting information received from the district collector, chief medical officer, and other govt. authorities, including entitlements of extended schemes.
 "We do different programmes on information received from the district collector, chief medical officer and other government authorities, including entitlements of extended schemes. We also did a series called '21 din 21 baatein' with a message by an expert along with a thematic poem on frequent handwashing, access to healthcare services, physical distancing, importance of yoga, and time for self-learning on a daily basis to spread positivity in people," said Fakat Hussain, a Radio Jockey at the CR. "Discussions on contemporary issues, including the coronavirus outbreak, and local folk songs on social isolation are presented to listeners. Some are live and interactive sessions, with listeners asking questions. Officials cannot possibly go to every village, but through this medium they can communicate to the maximum number of people," he added.
 Pradeepta Dutta, chairman of Radio Kisan which operates from Orissa's Balipatna said, "Our programmes are completely about the lockdown situation. Details like timings and location of weekly markets, adhering to rules on safe distance, and the status of local ATMs are some critical messages that community radio can disseminate effectively. When misinformation is flooded on social media, people get confused, so we also have to act as a fact checker". There are over 270 Community Radio stations operational in the country.
 "While community radios are playing an important role in educating people in remote areas of the country, they are struggling with funds as the outbreak of COVID-19 has further strained their limited resources," N A Shah Ansari, President of Community Radio Association told PTI. "In a letter to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting we have appealed for advertisements and a one-time grant to procure additional equipment to be able to run their services for communities," he added.
 The country is under a lockdown since March 25 to contain the spread of coronavirus. The lockdown has now been extended till May 3. The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 824 and the number of cases climbed to 26,496 in India on Sunday, according to the Union health ministry.

When the Premier League called for an across-the-board 30 per cent cut in wages to help meet the ­financial challenges of the ­ coronavirus crisis, PFA chief ­executive Gordon Taylor resisted.
 Players now hold the upper hand – and Taylor could see no sense in bailing out clubs owned by ­billionaires, when his members could give money directly to the NHS.
 The PFA’s headquarters in ­Manchester is less than a mile away from the original union offices in St Peter’s Square. Taylor has been in charge since 1981 and earns around £2.3million-a-year for presiding over an organisation that banks an ­annual £23m payment from the ­Premier League.
 Players now pay a one-off joining fee of £20 to ­become members and a yearly subscription of £150. Back in 1908, the joining fee was five ­shillings (25p), with a further sixpence (2.5p) payable weekly.
 The main aim of the union was to get the maximum wage abolished.
 Initially set by the FA in 1900 in a bid to prevent the top ­players ­chasing bigger salaries, it had been raised to just £20 by the time the threat of a PFA strike put paid to the practice 61 years later. Initially, the union had the backing of many clubs. But when the players seemed certain to take industrial ­action in 1909, the FA’s ­response was to issue the threat of suspension to anyone who refused to cancel their union ­membership.

Wear it.
 As National Safe Boating week nears, those two words say it all about your life jacket. It doesn’t do you any good sitting on the seat or laying on the bottom of the boat.
 In 2019, 84 percent of drowning victims in recreational boating wrecks weren’t wearing a life jacket, according to the National Safe Boating Council, which is based in Virginia.
 Boaters love their gear and most of them have their favorite life jacket. Before we eventually get back to our normal hustle and bustle on and off the water, take the time to inspect that gear.
 Remember, while there is no expiration date, life jackets do have a life cycle. It might be time to replace yours depending on how it’s been maintained or stored in or out of the boat.
 Look for tears or broken straps and buckles. If you find any broken straps or buckles, toss it.
 What makes a good life jacket? It’s one that fits properly when you are submerged in water. It’s one you can float on your back with plenty of buoyancy.
 If it’s time to replace your PFD, you may see a new label on life jackets when you shop for one at the store. The NSBC notes the new labels are being phased in, so you might find some life jackets in the store with the new label and others with the old label.
 What are the new labels all about?
 They have new icons noting performance level, turn ability and warnings, international symbols adopted from the International Standards Organization subcomittee for life jacket standards. They make I easier to understand and choose the right PDD.
 The performance level icon is a combination of five factors — bouyancy, freeboard, turning, stability and visibility. A lower level number generally offers greater mobility, comfort and style with good flotation for many wearers. They are intended for inshore (calm water) activities.
 The higher level number generally offers greater flotation, turning and stability in the water, factors important on offshore trips that often require more time in rescue situations. Stores now have life jackets with the new label for level 70 devices.
 The turn ability icon will point out of the life jacket will turn an unconscious wearer to his or her back. The warnings icons illustrate activities the life jacket isn’t designed for, such as whitewater rafting.
 Each life jacket will have a tag that serves as a quick reference guide for the icons.
 Teche Area boaters, inspect your life jackets. Wear them on the water.
 A life jacket can save your life. Try it on. Keep it on.

Don Naquin, who lived in so many places as a boy and young teen before his family settled in New Iberia, was talking about the past, mostly, and the future via cellphone around midday Monday.
 The outdoorsman loved to fish for freshwater and/or saltwater gamefish, cherished his friends and absolutely lived to volunteer to help others.
 As Naquin talked, he walked around disposing of cardboard boxes or something else that needed to be done, often pointed out by his wife of 26 years, Valerie. And when he spoke, there often was a catch in his voice, or a long pause before the words tumbled out.
 He was brand new, just into his second day, at being a former New Iberian. The 59-year-old, who retired earlier this month as an apparatus repairman after 41 years with Cleco, was busy moving into the couple’s new residence near Dalton, Georgia.
 Naquin left a well of tears behind, a well that filled fast as he said goodbye to people who made a difference in his life, and vice versa, here in the heart of the Teche Area. Mostly, those people remembered the kind-hearted volunteer.
 “I never thought of myself as that until I started telling people goodbye. It was heart-breaking, you know? Oh, man, dude, we’re excited to go, then we go tell people goodbye. While we were excited to go … it felt awful,” he said.
 The crying commenced, mutually, with each stop to say goodbye. There were a lot of stops the past few weeks.
 It was an awkward a time to say goodbyes because of current restrictions due to COVID-19. No one felt that more than Randy Montegut of New Iberia, who owns Bon Creole, where Naquin worked part-time for 20 or so years.
 “It came at a time when you can’t shake hands or give a hug,” Montegut said Thursday evening.
 “We hated to see him go but he’s excited about the challenge,” he said. “We’re going to miss him. We’re going to miss him a lot.”
 How did Naquin go from New Iberia — where he moved with his mother, Nell Naquin, who lives now in Broussard — to a small community, Villanow, Georgia, a few hours north of Atlanta? The Naquins planned their retirement move over the past year, he said.
 Naquin’s wife became very ill in May 2019. She had surgery and her thyroid was removed.
 Soon after the health crisis, Valerie, born and raised in New Iberia, told her husband she’d like to move closer to her three half-sisters and relocate in northern Georgia.
 “I’m a country boy at heart, so I was all in,” he said.
 “We felt like it was something we needed to do in life. We thought it all out. People do it every day. We’re not different than any other couple who do it, I don’t think.”
 Valerie, 61, retired this month after 13 years as office manager at Marine Industrial Fabrication at the Port of Iberia. She also started a successful part-time business, Desserts to Go, three years ago.
 “I know. It’s hard,” said the outdoorswoman whose father, the late Kenneth “Coco” Viator, took her fishing often in the Atchafalaya Basin. When it was time for a lunch on the water, she said, he’d dive in, pluck fresh oysters off the bottom and bring them up to dine on with a healthy dose of Tabasco.
 The veteran and accomplished speckled trout angler had a head start saltwater fishing-wise on her husband. Her grandfather, the late Warren Viator, took her saltwater fishing, she said. She’s hooked to this day and will miss it, said Valerie.
 “Tremendously. God, yes. I love it. I love it out there,” she said.
 They put New Iberia in the rearview mirror Friday and stayed overnight at the halfway point, Meridian, Mississippi, before completing the move to Villanow on Saturday. A relative drove the U-Haul straight through and nephews on her side who live in the region started emptying it after his arrival.
 Naquin was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and lived there three years before his mother, a Berwick native, relocated to Louisiana and remarried after she met J.C. Naquin. Her husband, a carpenter much of his life, adopted her son.
 They also lived in St. Martinville, Franklin, Jeanerette, Missouri and Singapore before settling in New Iberia in 1977. Naquin was homeschooled and got his high school diploma in Singapore but quickly learned there weren’t many, if any, jobs for 16-year-olds here so decided to attend New Ibera Senior High for his senior year and got another diploma at 17. Fresh out of school, he went to work for three years as a deckhand on an oilfield supply boat captained by J.C. Naquin.
 He started working for Cleco, first as a meter reader for nine years, then as an apparatus repairman fixing pole top transformers for 31 years.
 The Cleco employee also started cooking, becoming a “professional boiler,” as he described it, for the Monteguts at Bon Creole. He worked countless catering jobs.
 Naquin emerged during the 1990s as one of the community’s most active and dedicated volunteers, one with a big heart who couldn’t and wouldn’t say no.
 “I did so many benefits, helping and raising money. When I first started working with Cleco, they encouraged that, getting involved in the community,” he said.
 Montegut said, “Don put other people before himself in the things he did for people who raised money in events. Every time there was a fishing event, Don hustled up donations. He was a very great asset to the community. He’s a good person. He’s just a good guy.”
 Naquin devoted much of his spare time for a few decades to helping his close friend, the late Elvis Jeanminette, prepare for the popular Big Bass Classics that evolved from the Mardi Gras Mambo Big Bass Classic to the Top Rod Big Bass Classic to, eventually, the Big Bass Classic.
 He was banquet committee chairman and a tireless helper for the local Sugar Chapter of the Coastal Conservation Association of Louisiana, joining so many other area outdoorsmen who believed in the organization’s conservation cause.
 The outdoorsman also was a proud member of the Iberia Rod & Gun Club. He promoted the IR&GC’s annual fishing rodeo to the max, although he wasn’t a volunteer per se.
 “I really wanted to work the fishing rodeo site. But I really wanted to fish the rodeo and get my son involved,” he said, referring to his son, Matt, a Houston resident and marketing director for Parish Brewing Co. in Broussard.
 Naquin did just that and the two of them fished several fishing rodeos together with his wife aboard the Go Fish, a 19-foot Wellcraft that usually brought in more speckled trout that hit the leaderboard than any other boat and most of them were posted by hard-fishing Valerie, who collected several first-place trophies during that time.
 “That was probably from the mid-90s to the early 2000s. Then it got to where it was too much, fishing three days. Then I kind of slacked off. Matt got older and went on his way,” he said.
 Naquin continued to fish for speckled trout and redfish and stayed on them when they got in or around Vermilion Bay. He knew the community holes and the hush-hush destinations that consistently give up big speckled trout on the western side of the bay.
 A few weeks ago he sold the Go-Fish, as well as a jo-boat.
 He has no plans to quit fishing or, even, hunting.
 “I always hunted and fished at an early age in Missouri. I lived on a farm (near Birch Tree, Missouri). I could always go fishing and hunting when I wanted. You could see the ponds from the house,” he said. “At 10 years old, mom bought me a .410 crack barrel shotgun. I’ve still got it to this day.”
 Fast forward to the years after he moved to Cajun Country, where the Atchafalaya Basin is a comfortable boat tow away as is Vermilion Bay. Ricky Watkins of New Iberia first taught him how to fish for bass in this area, he said, while his first saltwater fishing lessons were administered by Terry Robicheaux.
 Apparently, he learned well from Watkins and Robicheaux.
 As far as he is concerned, Vermilion Bay in its prime season (late summer through early winter) doesn’t have an equal.
 “I think we have the best in the country. I might be partial. But I’ve talked to a lot of people in the country. They don’t have places like we do,” he said.
 Unless he visits the heart of Cajun Country, those venues will be fond memories.
 “Oh, uh, I’m going to miss it severely. I’ll fish what I can up here, lakes and creeks,” he said.
 He might even break out the old faithful crack barrel this fall.

Watching the footage back perhaps the most interesting thing is how every Guyana player sings the national anthem before kick-off with such gusto.
 Sixteen of the 23-man squad were not born in Guyana, the majority of them had never been to the country before being called up. The squad was more London than Georgetown.
 “Most had played in qualification but there were a couple of newbies who didn’t have much affiliation with the country,” Cox explains.
 “That’s always difficult but the boys who had been previously, the likes of myself and Neil Danns, who had been playing the last five years – we have a big connection with the country, the people and family there.
 “But we did make sure all the boys knew the national anthem.
 “We made sure the boys did a tour of the country, got to see the culture and understand what Guyana was really about but in the Gold Cup everybody had to sing the national anthem, be proud of where they came from. They had to understand their roots and where they came from. It was humbling for all of us.”
 Coming through Spurs’ academy before embarking on a journey through England’s lower leagues, Cox was accustomed to sharing a pitch with Harry Kane, Danny Rose and Andros Townsend.
 So he was not daunted by the presence of Christian Pulisic or Weston McKennie. Still, a TV audience of millions and sold out stadiums were a world away from some of the National League South’s hotspots.
 “The level of competition didn’t phase me because of my background,” he says. “Obviously I didn’t make the grade at Tottenham. I was close to it, training with the first team, so I knew what the standard was.
 “Dropping down the leagues you still play against top opposition and I’d played against World Cup and Premier League winners. It was kind of more about where I should be. I’ve worked my way to it, I deserve the moment. But, no, it didn’t phase me one bit.”
 There were still challenges, mind. The first hotel they checked into, a Holiday Inn, was not up to standard so they had to arrange alternative accommodation. There were issues with the food and the luxuries afforded to the US side before they met in St Paul seemed a world apart.

Let me share a bit about the fruit that has matured during these delays. Our consultants finished our financial feasibility study on November 7, 2018, the night before the Camp Fire ravaged our neighbors and our region. We knew we had to revisit what we had learned during the study in light of this event. No one could predict what was next. We spent six months reassessing the commitment of our donor community. During the summer we revisited the programming plans with our nonprofit and county colleagues. We finished all of that work in August of 2019, concluding that the community was enthusiastically committed to the need for a more comprehensive, inclusive project more than ever. Had we finished all of our plans prior to the fire, we would not have been able to flex with the new needs. What a gift!

Bonin said he’ll further propose that the city use federal funds “to either buy hotels that go belly-up, or use that to buy the distressed properties that are absolutely gonna be on the market at cheaper prices after this crisis is over, and use that as homeless and affordable housing. It’s going to be a hell of a lot cheaper if we purchase stuff that is already there and move people in quickly than if we start from scratch.”

He went on to call social media a double-edged sword. While it can be the breeding grounds for public shaming, it can also be used as a mechanism for maintaining social connection.
 An April 7 article from the New York Times stated that there has been a 27 percent increase in Facebook use since the first U.S. COVID-19 death on Feb. 29. Video chat platforms such as the website Nextdoor.com and the app Houseparty have also seen more than a 70 percent increase in use since that same day.
 Jeffrey Hall, a communications professor at the University of Kansas who studies social media, said he believes people are engaging in more interactive social media use these days. From what he’s seen on his feeds, people have been posting pictures and stories from their own lives and commenting on similar posts from their acquaintances.
 “These types of interactive behaviors are much more socially oriented than just browsing content,” he said.
 But social media can also become a platform for people to shame and become indignant at strangers or those with whom they may not have a close connection, Lapsley said.
 Lapsley and Hall, meanwhile, said shame is actually not a productive incentivizer for a person to change his or her behavior.
 “Shame is a poor motivator for pro-social action,” Hall wrote. “Right now, we need people to make personal sacrifices for the good of the community — particularly wearing masks and practicing social distancing.”
 He also said people should keep in mind that one does not typically know why another person is doing what he or she is doing, and thus people should be careful as they make recommendations to others.
 Though Lapsley said he hopes the public can find a productive way to “provide feedback without the shame,” he did note that social media shaming might help change the perception of collective social norms. That is, while social media shaming is unlikely to change the behavior of the person receiving the criticism, it could be a learning lesson for a third party witnessing the interaction.
 Griggs, the high school junior, is an example of this. He’s been following social distancing and public health guidelines from early on in the pandemic, but the peer pressure from social media was an influence that for him solidified the necessity of such cautionary measures.
 Yet while this pandemic has brought out another opportunity for virtual public shaming, it has also provided the opportunity for increased compassion. In times of great disasters, people come together and the “collective empathy for our fellow citizens can be immense,” Lapsley said.
 He then noted the opportunity for something he called an “empathic contagion,” during which as the coronavirus spreads its way across the globe into seemingly every nook and cranny of humans’ lives, so too can empathy spread and contaminate the moral fibers of friends, neighbors and strangers.
 While Lapsley said it would be better if it didn’t take a pandemic to make people more empathetic, he did conclude, “I do think it is telling how in times of great disasters, people do come together.”

 Her terribly wrong vote made her the only Democrat in either the House or Senate siding against any of the four coronavirus bailouts passed since early March.
