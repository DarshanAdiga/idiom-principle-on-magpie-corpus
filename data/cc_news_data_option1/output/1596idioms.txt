TORRINGTON — Charges against a woman who gave birth to a baby under the influence of methamphetamine were dropped after her defense attorney successfully argued the charging statute doesn’t consider a fetus a person until birth.
 Barbara Stewart, of Torrington, is a free woman after her attorney, Charles MacDonald, cited holes in Wyoming statutes that don’t define a fetus as an unborn or pre-born child, and that a person isn’t a mother until a live birth occurs.
 Stewart gave birth to a child that was born under the influence of methamphetamine in August. She tested positive for the presence of meth, as did the child.
 She was charged with felony child abuse and delivery of methamphetamine to a minor - but, according to MacDonald, Stewart was not a mother when she ingested the drug, and the child wasn’t a person.

Chandigarh, Apr 23 (PTI) Around 25,000 babies were born in Punjab hospitals during the first week of the curfew imposed to check the coronavirus spread, Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said here on Thursday.
 "In the month of March, about 32,000 pregnant women had registered for the antenatal check-up and nearly 25,000 deliveries took place at both government and private hospitals in the state," the minister said.
 Punjab had clamped the curfew on March 23 in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
 Sidhu said about 99 per cent of the deliveries were institutional.
 Fifty-eight per cent of them took place in government hospitals and 41 per cent in private ones, he said.
 The maximum 3,000 deliveries took place in Ludhiana followed by Amritsar (2,550), Patiala (2,000), Bathinda (1,690), Gurdaspur (1,330), Sangrur (1,300) and Hoshiarpur (1,300), he said.
 After the curfew was imposed in Punjab, directions were given to all civil surgeons to ensure that pregnant women and children do not suffer.
 "The essential services, including immunisation, are being provided at all government facilities round the clock for pregnant women and children," he said.

New York, Apr 23 (AP) COVID-19 may have knocked US stocks into a bear market and pummeled the US economy, but the disease has also left some companies asking the question: "What recession?"
 Streaming media services, video game makers, and consumer staples companies have all gained ground as people stay home, try to stay entertained and focus on essentials.
 Netflix, already the top streaming entertainment service, has benefited from a mostly captive audience and its shares are up about 30 per cent in 2020.
 Amazon.com has seen consumers flock to its site for their purchases.
 The retail giant has been furiously hiring workers to meet demand, bucking the national trend of mass layoffs.
 It's shares are up more than 27 per cent for the year.
 "The outperformance of those names has been nothing but extraordinary," said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
 "We have no doubt they will gain in importance as mainstays of life."
 The gains are in stark contrast to the more than 13 per cent drop in the broad S&P; 500 index this year and some of the hardest hit industries.
 Airlines have been pummeled, with American Airlines Group falling more than 64 per cent.
 Cruise line operator Carnival lost more than 78 per cent and retailer Kohl's is down about 70 per cent.
 Grocery chains and certain consumer product makers, including Clorox, have also held up well as consumers shop for food, toiletry and cleaning essentials during the pandemic.
 Investors have been mostly hunkering down as they absorb updates about the virus and its economic impact.
 Analysts are urging investors to stay calm and look more closely at how a company is positioned financially and whether its business model is solid.
 "What you want to know is that the company can survive intact," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds.
 "You need to know that the company can weather the storm."
 Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, is benefiting from its reach and distribution network as shoppers focus on food and other essentials.
 Investors have also given steady support to Kroger and other large grocery chains, as food shopping remains essential during the business shutdowns. Walmart shares have risen about 16 per cent in April.
 The pandemic is also shining a spotlight on normally low-key investments in household consumer product companies.
 Clorox, whose name is synonymous with bleach, is seeing demand surge for its household cleaning and sanitizing products.
 Investors are also focused on a handful of drug developers that quickly moved to begin developing treatments for COVID-19.
 Both Regeneron and Gilead Sciences have seen their stocks jump over the last several months as investors cheer encouraging updates on their progress. (AP)

Chris told host Jimmy Kimmel, "My wife was ordering a box of toilet paper, like, three months ago and thought it was 15 rolls and ordered 15 boxes. So, unintentionally, we're stocked. We can bootleg this stuff if need be, but we have 15 boxes of toilet paper there."   The 'Thor' actor further talked about his family and the dad of three opened up about homeschooling his little ones during the coronavirus pandemic, noting that his teaching skills are not up to par.

Washington D.C.

According to People magazine, the 47-year-old former actor said during an Instagram Live video chat with celebrity makeup artist Gucci Westman on Wednesday (local time) that she loves that her husband is a "night" person.   Diaz shared, "Benji wants to go to bed late, and I like to go to bed early... that works so well for us as parents."   "I can go to bed a few hours early and he does those later feeds with her," she said of her 3-month-old baby girl Raddix. "I can wake up early and be with her in the morning and [Benji] can sleep."
