Schneider Electric has kicked off its Innovation Summit World Tour 2020, a major virtual event series from October 8 to November 26, that connects thought leaders, visionaries, experts, change makers, partners and customers globally to discover the latest digital solutions for a more resilient and sustainable future.


  In his virtual keynote address, Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Schneider Electric’s Chairman and CEO, urged attendees to accelerate their digital transformation to better position themselves for the upheaval caused by both the climate crisis and the global pandemic that has swept the world in 2020.


  “Across the globe, in just a few months, our lives have changed – and digitalisation has helped us to adapt to the new normal. Digitised remote operations can maintain business continuity, strengthen resiliency, and offer insights to better anticipate and adapt with agility. Digital innovation and connectivity have changed how we work and live together, and can positively change our impact on the environment, and drive economic recovery and sustainability for us all,” he said.


  Schneider’s flagship annual Innovation Summits are now in their fifth year. This year’s iteration is the first to take place purely online, with ten regional – and interactive -- events to follow over the coming eight weeks. These will give attendees from around the globe the chance to learn more about the critical role that electrification, digitisation, innovation, energy management and industrial automation can play in the transition towards a lower-carbon world to limit climate change to 1.5°C.

Innovations at the center’s South Minnesota Avenue building include using its large storefront windows to feature some artists’ work. Some classes were suspended; others moved online or outdoors. Members of its drawing group met regularly under the pavilion at Minnesota Square Park.


  A one-day fall artisans fair has been revamped into an 11-week showcase of for-sale works with a rotating schedule for photographers, jewelry makers, painters and authors.


  Holiday Market will reach the same fans of local art as did the 2019 Holiday Fare, but with time and space to spread out, Fee said.


  She said the event probably won’t bring in lots of funds for the center this year; however, participants will have a chance to earn some income. When a book or artist print is sold, 70% of the profits go to its creator.


  “The art center used to charge $50 to participating artists; this year, we wanted it to be a no-risk event for them.”


  Fee said gallery exhibits are slated through 2022. Artists on the schedule who felt receptions were essential to their shows were given an option to reschedule.


  “Most art centers are never dense with people, except during the openings.”


  The Carnegie Art Center in Mankato has not yet set a re-opening date.


  Dana Sikkila, executive director of The 410 Project on Front Street, opened its gallery space in September; however, she nixed receptions and their accompanying musical performances for the time being.

Case in point, when backup Lindell Stone led a third-quarter drive starting at the Cavaliers’ 24, Virginia was knocking at the doorstep of the Pack’s red zone, but redshirt freshman defensive end Terrell Dawkins came up with a huge forced fumble that redshirt junior linebacker Isaiah Moore recovered, keeping NC State’s lead at 17. Those turnovers just give the defense breathing room.


  And sometimes turnovers breathe life into a team. Sometimes “two points is not two points.” With the Cavaliers cutting into NC State’s lead and the Pack’s offense struggling, junior defensive tackle Alim McNeill deflected a pass, picked it off himself and took it back 18 yards to the house for NC State’s first points of the second half, putting the team back up 17 points. That was more than a touchdown. That pick six snuffed out whatever momentum Virginia had, and it ended the game. It also inspired the offense to get going.


  “We got off to a bad start in the second half, not being able to move the ball running or passing,” said sophomore running back Zonovan Knight. “So especially that play with Alim, that was the big motivation for the offense, after that everyone was like ‘Let’s go, let’s go.’ That played a huge factor in us being successful offensively in the second half.”


  Between the four turnovers NC State forced, the offense scored 17 points off them, equal to the game’s 38-21 margin. Those turnovers were the difference between the Wolfpack falling back to .500 and it emerging as a surefire top- half ACC team. Offense wins games, defense wins championships, but it’s much easier to do both those things with a bit of luck on your side.


  With this performance, NC State has had games that showed flashes of a great run game (Wake), great pass game (Pitt) and now great defensive play. It’s just about putting it all together, now. Especially for this defense. One game won’t erase the results it put on the field in NC State’s first three games, but it is cause for some cautious optimism.


  “We’re nowhere [near] where we want to be, obviously, but as each week goes, we’re growing and growing better together,” McNeill said. “Once we reach our peak and where we want to be it’s gonna be scary, I’m not going to lie to you. Y’all are definitely seeing us becoming one of those top-tier defenses.”

A national group that advocates for citizens' access to the ballot is urging Ohio officials to not stand in the way of a potential referendum issue. The referendum would ask voters to reject the new energy law that bails out nuclear power and subsidizes coal and solar.


  Opponents of the bailout want voters to reject it but are facing roadblocks on it’s path to the ballot. And the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center says that’s part of a larger trend.


  The group's executive director, Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, says state legislatures have introduced more than 120 bills that make it harder to put issues on the ballot and harder to pass them.


  "That is your voice, it's actually an opportunity for people to say what they want for their families, for their communities. It's so important to have a democracy that thrives, it's supposed to represent us."


  The referendum group is rewriting its language after the attorney general rejected the first draft, which isn’t unusual for a first try. But a law firm argues that the subsidies are a tax increase, which are safe from referendum.

India's top cricketer Smriti Mandhana will lead the Trailblazers squad in the Women's T20 Challenge to be held during the playoff week of the Indian Premier League in the United Arab Emirates, organisers said Sunday.


  Australian stars will miss out on the four-match tournament to be held from November 4 to 9 as the dates clash with the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL), widely considered the top women's Twenty20 tournament.


  The WBBL is due to be held from October 25 to November 29 in Sydney where an Olympic-style sports village has been set up.


  Australian stars had in August expressed displeasure over the scheduling of the Women's Challenge, saying it would force players to pick between the two competitions.


  India's Harmanpreet Kaur, and Mithali Raj were named as captains of the Supernovas and Velocity teams in the squads named by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.


  The teams were picked by a selection committee, unlike the IPL where players are bought in auctions.


  England's Sophie Ecclestone, named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year in 2018, would play for the Trailblazers in the tournament which will also have players from Sri Lanka, New Zealand, South Africa and the West Indies.


  Thailand's Natthakan Chantham, who scored her country's first Women's T20 World Cup half-century, will become the first Thai cricketer to feature in the tournament, the BCCI statement added.


  The IPL and the Women's Challenge were moved to the UAE as coronavirus cases soared in India, the second worst-hit country in the world after the United States.


  The games are being played behind closed doors at three venues including Dubai and Sharjah.


  The IPL final will be played on November 10.

BANKS VIRGINIA BANKS "Ginny On Friday, October 2, 2020. It is with our deepest regret that we announce the passing of Ginny. Mother of Robert (Latchmin) Banks of Baldwin, NY and the late Richard (Deborah) Banks of Annapolis; Grandmother of Killian Banks also from Baldwin, NY; Aunt to John (Debbie) Manson of Bowie, Stacey Manson of Delaware and Mark (Pam) Townsend of College Park; Sister in Law to Etta Manson also of Delaware. Ginny had been battling Covid for a few weeks and was almost through that when she suffered a stroke at her home and was taken to Doctor's Hospital. She remained there for sixteen days and then was transferred to Waugh Chapel/Genesis nursing facility where she ultimately passed. Ginny was born Virginia Kent Manson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 18th, 1919 to Minnie Heurd and Robert Garrett Manson. Robert was a Railroad engineer. The family moved to Washington, DC and Ginny attended Eastern High School where she graduated in 1936. She subsequently went to the Washington School for Secretaries where she became proficient in typing and shorthand. Ginny started out as a Kelly Girl working different assignments all over the Washington area but ultimately took her first full-time government position with the FDIC. From there she left and took a position with the National Defense Commission (War Production Board). shortly thereafter, she worked with the DOD (US Engineering Corp), and was stationed in Bermuda during the second world war. Ginny married her first husband Robert in Bermuda and took his last name Glenn. After the war, Ginny worked for the Alien Property Custodians in New York City. She separated from her husband and moved back to Washington, DC. She soon accepted an assignment with the State Department in Montevideo Uruguay workingfor the ambassador, Christian Ravndal. She met Walter Banks, a Uruguayan businessman at an embassy function, and married him shortly thereafter. She left government service to raise two children in Uruguay but remained active in the ex-pat community. Running the embassy thrift shop for charity and actively involved in the American Women's Club. She later separated from her husband and returned to the United States with her two children. Ginny went back to government work at the department of Health Education and Welfare and Office of Management and Budget. She later transferred to the Central Intelligence Agency as director Frank Carlucci's Administrative Assistant for many years. Ginny finished her career with the Pentagon and retired in 1985. Throughout her life Ginny has always been hardworking, dependable, generous, helpful, and kind. She held on to her independence until the very end and was lucky to have the wonderful support of family and friends that allowed her to stay in her home in College Park for over fifty years. Ginny has always had a remarkable sense of humor which she used to reckless abandon. She loved music and was always singing, whistling, or humming at different stages of her life. No matter what was going on she was always of good cheer and that reflected on everyone that had the good fortune to spend time with her. She will be sorely missed by all. The family has elected to not have a formal funeral service at this time but reserves the right to have a Memorial at some post-Covid date as well as a 101st birthday party in Ginny's honor.

Betfair will be keeping all that dough unless Donald or Joe drop out before election day. That's about $15 million; nearly all on Dems. B) This is a race with no form, (except that Donald won easily last time, of course) so the only guide is the polls. That they are manipulated to try to dispirit Donald voters is obvious, but a pleasant side benefit is that Democrat punters believe them and are now the classic Turkeys lining up for thanksgiving. C) When someone puts $1 on Joe at $1.50 this means a Trump supporter is putting up the 50 cents theycould win. When someone puts $1 on Donald a Joe-supporter is offering the $2 that that bettor will win. Thus…on average the Donald lovers are in the hole for around $45 million should Joe come home first, and the Joe supporters are owing about $200 million to Donald backers. The Democratic faithful are nuts!

  There's little that's certain about the Nov. 3 general election, other than people's uncertainties are many.


  At the top of the heap, of course, is the presidential race between incumbent Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.


  Texas has gone Republican in every presidential election since 1980. The last Democrat to carry the state was Jimmy Carter, in 1976.


  Trump won 52 percent of the vote in 2016. In Taylor County, it was 73 percent.


  Our county likely will remain red, though a Trump repeat in Texas is not a sure thing.


  While maybe not a sure thing, races closer to home seem far more predictable. You can bank on a strong showing by Republicans.


  We expect U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington to keep his job. After surviving a nine- candidate field in the Republican primary in 2016, he cruised to wins in two general elections. Abilene attorney Tom Watson will make a good showing but the pandemic likely has limited his ability to get out and about in the sprawling district.


  Arrington won 77 percent of the 2018 vote in Taylor County, and 75 percent across the district.


  Also expected to win easily is state Sen. Dawn Buckingham. She won 73 percent of the vote in 2016, after she ousted Abilene's Susan King in the Republican primary.


  She is facing a little-known Democrat, Clayton Tucker.


  Stan Lambert should be returning to Austin. He, too, won 77 percent of the vote in Taylor, and 84 percent in Jones County and 79 percent in Nolan County. Those three counties comprise District 71.


  Within the county, we're choosing a mayor for Abilene. Anthony Williams, the city's first Black mayor, is seeking a second and, word is getting out, final term. He doesn't want to out-Norm former mayor Norm Archibald, and he may have other political aspirations.


  He faces Cynthia Alvidrez, who is seeking election for a third time. She previously ran unsuccessfully for the Abilene ISD board and a City Council seat.


  Interestingly, this race for the first time features two minorities.


  We expect a solid win by Williams.


  As for Place 3 on the Abilene City Council, Donna Albus surprised more than a few by seeking re-election. She faces Sheria Ford Davis, who is a champion for the handicapped (she is herself) and Anthony Jojola.


  Albus is expected to win without a runoff.


  Perhaps the most closely contested races will be for Wylie ISD board. Incumbent Steve Keenum and Abe Templeton drew opponents. Cheryl Sawyers, who has name recognition through various jobs in Abilene, will give Keenum, the father of NFL player Case Keenum, a good race.


  Templeton faces Brad Hill.


  The incumbents will likely win.


  But this being 2020, anything could happen.


  What should be noted, however, is what we will be getting with the expected winners.


  We endorse Williams, who has packed a lot into three years. Actually, more than three, since he officially is the longest serving first-term mayor due to COVID-19.


  Everyone has an opinion on pandemic leadership, from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to 555 Walnut Street in downtown Abilene. It was a great unknown, and we think Williams' carefully navigated health concerns (he got COVID-19 himself) and economic interests.


  Albus was successful in 2018 in quelling the rise of the anti-establishment movement that had brought Steve Savage and Bruce Kreitler to the City Council. We were surprised that Alvidrez ran for mayor; perhaps, there was concern she'd oppose Albus, prompting efforts to keep the city's 2016 Citizen of the Year on the council.


  Albus does love Abilene, but we need her to be forceful, too.


  We are impressed with Davis. She is another Abilenian who needs to be plugged in. She has something to say on behalf of those often overlooked.


  More than a few people have wondered why Lambert has been so silent during the pandemic. He would be the bridge between local leadership seeking restriction relief for Abilene and the statehouse. We didn't see the teamwork we expected.


  Give Hatton credit for trying again and questioning state leadership. His passion at times drowns his message, and West Texans aren't up for that.


  When Census data is in and tabulated, however long that will take, expect Texas' district to look different. We hope that includes our state Senate district. We can count on one hand the significant appearances of Buckingham in Abilene the past four years. The most noteworthy was her carriage mishap in the 2018 Western Heritage Classic parade. She was unhurt and said she'd be back in 2019. She did not return.


  We need a state senator to represent West Texas and stop by more than now and then to see us.


  As for Congress, Arrington, to many, lives and dies on his strong relationship with the president. He supports Trump policies that he believes benefit West Texas; he said Trump did not run in 2016 on a civility platform, and even Arrington says the president could do better in that regard.


  Even as a Republican swimming upstream if Biden hooks the presidency, we believe Arrington will have more impact for West Texas than a first-term representative in Watson.


  The common thread in all this? We cannot afford leadership on cruise, even for those who cruise to victory.


  Regardless of where your vote lands, please vote to determine the future of our city and West Texas.

Some of the biggest races on the ballot next year could be for the Ohio Supreme Court. Two seats now held by Republican justices will be open. A prominent Democrat who has held statewide office says she wants one of them.


  Appeals Court Judge and former Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner said she is running for the seat now held by Justice Judith French. Brunner said she is running because the court will take up big issues like criminal justice and property rights.


  “The Supreme Court sort of sets the tone for what issues are we going to consider, what issues are we going to look at, how are we going to look at them and they have a way, as I saw when I was Secretary of State protecting people’s votes, of filtering down to affect people in the most intimate ways.”


  Brunner will join Cleveland Judge John O’Donnell in a run for the high court. If both win, it would tip the control of the court to Democrats, which could be important in 2021 if there are challenges to the state’s new redistricting process.

I completely understand that the last thing you want to do after a long day of work is dice vegetables. But instead of giving into convenience and temptation, try dedicating several hours one day a week to doing nothing but preparing healthy meals that will fuel you through the upcoming week. You can easily triple or quadruple your favorite healthy recipes and refrigerate or freeze the leftovers in meal-size portions.


  Then—when you are on the run or tired after a long day of work—all you have to do is reheat the healthy food you have already prepared. Doing this is worth the extra effort, and it's so much healthier (and cheaper) than takeout.


  Instead of ordering breakfast or lunch at work, why not just take 20 minutes each night to prepare food to take with you? Find a sunny spot outside and enjoy your healthy homemade lunch in peace while connecting with nature at the same time.

In the first few hours, the pair see a couple muskies that follow lures but won’t hit, even when the baits are worked in lazy circles or figure-8s to entice boatside strikes. The best action of the day comes from the occasional ambitious and enthusiastic northern pike, small specimens from 1 to 4 pounds that are attacking a lure that is nearly as big as the pike.


  Neither man cusses the determined fish for it’s nice to have a break from the monotony of casting lures with no tug on the end of the line.


  By the end of the morning, the pair make a democratic decision to leave the lake to return to a different lake an hour distant that produced a number of follows yesterday.


  Nicknamed the Muskie Sasquatch after he brazenly ran off a young black bear that kept harassing a muskie fishing guide’s camp, Hokanson has the appearance of a true fishing bum, although it’s partly the result of six months of quarantining.


  His black hair is curled, pulled tight into a bun or tucked under the edges of a baseball cap. A moustache and chin-curtain beard complete the look, set below his familiar sunglasses and faded and dirty-billed guide cap.


  I ask Hokanson how he keeps going with 12-hour shifts of hard, physical labor and longer days off spent chasing a fish that can be fickle, acting as an apparition for weeks at a time.


  “Caffeine, nicotine, and rage,” is his succinct response, noting his frustration, the madness he gets as the fishless days and hours add up, helps him stay focused and ticked off enough to want to score against the challenging muskie.


  Yff and Hokanson throw lures in familiar haunts, but it’s a different day and a different mood for this lake’s muskies. Hokanson has one fish follow, but nothing will commit. The remainder of the afternoon passes with no action, except for a single northern pike.


  Without hanging heads, the pair call it a day and head for home, to crawl into beds and recharge for another full day of fishing.


  On the second day, it’s another early start, this time heading east of Hayward to try some river musky fly fishing.


  Musky fly fishing is anything but elegant. Giant streamers are put on shooting head sinking fly lines. After dousing these flies in the receiving water, they have enough bulk to be tossed around easily, as compared to the dainty flies used on trout or bass that rely on the weight of the fly line to carry them forward.


  Casted easily is probably not the right description – they are chucked around in a fatiguing manner. Hokanson tells me about a client who prepared to spend a weekend fly fishing muskies by practicing the casting motion with a sledgehammer for weeks ahead of his trip.


  Yff and Hokanson sling flies with aggressive rod swings and line hauls that looks like pull-starting a motor. They move up and down the river, carefully wading as they go.


  After sufficiently covering the water, the pair head back to the truck and head up or down stream to a new access site. If they move a fish, they might return to see if it will bite later.


  The morning rolls along, stop by stop. No fish seem to be home, until near the noon hour, Yff hooks a muskie. Hokanson grabs his oversize landing net and is at the ready, but halfway back to shore, the fish shakes free, breaking both men’s hearts in the process.


  Eventually the day ends as Yff must return to Illinois. Four days, numerous follows, a couple strikes, no fish landed.


  It’s an altogether common outcome for muskie anglers, but eternally optimistic, they face the long odds gladly and count each day as moving closer to another muskie in the net and another fish bested.

On Aug. 26 the Banning school board unanimously approved appointments of Tonia Causey-Bush as their next chief academic officer, and Craig McAlpin as its chief business officer.
 A few days later in another closed session meeting, the board approved the appointment of former Beaumont superintendent of schools Terrence Davis to be Banning’s assistant superintendent of human resources.
 That time, the decision was not unanimous, which became evident when their contracts were approved during the Sept. 30 school board meeting.
 School board president Jason Smith, Clerk Leslie Sattler and Lucia Martinez- Lara voted to approve Davis’s contract, while Laura Troutman dissented and Mayra Anguiano abstained.
 The district’s three-year contract calls for Davis to be paid $200,000 annually, and includes health benefits, membership in professional associations related to the position; retirement benefits, 22 vacation days minimum, and 12 sick days — benefits extended to the other administrators whose contracts were approved that evening.
 Jason Smith said “His resume speaks volumes of what his qualifications are, and what he is capable of doing. He’s going to bring a level of talent and experience that we sorely need.”
 Smith addressed rumors circulating about Davis’s “sudden departure” from Beaumont, stating “To me that’s all they are, are rumors, until proven otherwise. To me, it’s a no-brainer,” claiming that “He’s already proven to be a very valuable asset” to the district.
 In explaining her reason to abstain, Anguiano said “Mr. Davis does have experience. My reservation comes from the reasoning that is unknown as to why he was on administrative leave.”
 For clerk Sattler, “My impression is that he is going to get the work done. Our district needs to focus on everyone being able to work together; and if we’re going to decide on rumors, then the rumor is he’s getting along really well with the two unions … One of the things we looked at when considering Mr. Davis was his record at Beaumont that was beyond rumors was that the graduation rate was in the 96th percentile; that the school district grew tremendously while he was there; their test scores were up. As a board, it’s our role to set the direction for our school district, and I feel like getting the scores up is our number one goal. I feel that Mr. Davis has that expertise to do that for us. He has a glowing record of bringing a district up to where it should be.”
 Lara agreed that “He has done great work in the time he’s been here,” however, added “In my opinion, there are too many unanswered questions, so I have my reservations for hiring Mr. Davis. Until my questions are answered, I don’t think I’ll be too comfortable” making a decision to hire him.
 Troutman personally addressed him with a warning, saying “Mr. Davis, if you are voted in, that if any of these allegations or rumors hold any truth, we will be taking action.”
 Contrarily, the board unanimously gave glowing recommendations for Tonia Causey-Bush, who’s three-year contract entitles her to a salary of $175,000 to be the district’s chief academic officer, having previously served as the chief academic officer of Education Services for the Fontana Unified School District.
 Angiano said “I’m really excited to have you on board. I loved the presence I felt during our interview. I truly believe you’re going to be an amazing asset.”
 Craig McAlpin received also received unanimous support for his three-year contract for $200,000 annually to serve as the district’s chief business officer, having most recently served as Director of Fiscal and Administrative Services for the Anaheim Elementary School District.
 Smith noted her “very high accolades and recommendations. I think you’re going to be a wonderful fit, and you’re going to do wonders during your tenure here.”
 Troutman said that the district is “very excited to work with you. I know we’re going to do great things — we can only go up from here.”

Dunbar, a Western North Carolina native who also went to A-B Tech, was once the co-owner of The Asheville Commissary, a restaurant he ran with Farm to Fender chef Jeremiah Jackson.


  After that, Dunbar joined Rise N Shine Cafe, where he worked for three years before stepping down after an ownership change.


  He accepted a head chef gig with Rye Knot, with a start date in March. Then COVID-19 entered the picture.


  Dunbar, a single father of 8- and 6-year-old boys, couldn’t file for unemployment because he’d just quit his job and had yet to start a new one.


  Byron offered him half his salary to wait on hold until the restaurant could reopen, and Dunbar agreed. “I’d help him build tables just to get some hours in,” Dunbar said.


  Now that the restaurant is finally opened, Dunbar delights in making house- ground burgers, sausages and the smoked meatloaf that’s won the North Asheville neighborhood over.


  Dunbar said kitchens can be like the military in that everyone performs a crucial role, no matter where they stand in the hierarchy. The success of the team, he said, depends on finding the right combination of people.


  “When you get the right group of people, it works well,” he said. “And right now we’ve got that.”


  “I’m so pleased I found him,” Byron said of Dunbar. “Everything comes out first class all the way.”


  WHISKEY IN THE BARREL


  There are better times to open a bar and restaurant than in the middle of a pandemic. Still, Byron said the space, with its expansive patio with room for 60 and refurbished open interior, including a brand-new hood system, is safe by design.


  Now, Byron said, the biggest question he gets isn’t who redid the former El Chapala space — it’s RedHouse Architecture, a favorite of local restaurants and breweries — it’s whether he plans to get heaters to keep the patio open year-round during COVID.


  Meanwhile, Byron is brewing away and expects to have 4-6 of his own “Captain Bob” beers on a 16-tap system in the coming months. The first to hit the tap is a dry low-ABV stout Byron likens to Guinness, though he doesn’t have a nitro system.


  There are plenty of spirits at the bar from other distilleries, with a menu of house cocktails including a smoked-rye Old Fashioned.


  But Byron’s own house-made spirits are in the works. He’s in the process of aging some whiskey, with rye, bourbon, corn and single-malt styles to come. Though most of it has two years to go, a small batch of rye should be ready by Thanksgiving.


  Brewery-distillery hybrids, though increasingly popular, are rare. To Byron’s knowledge, this is the first for Asheville.


  “I could never had imagined myself as the captain of this ship, I’ll tell you that,” he said.

BANKS VIRGINIA BANKS "Ginny On Friday, October 2, 2020. It is with our deepest regret that we announce the passing of Ginny. Mother of Robert (Latchmin) Banks of Baldwin, NY and the late Richard (Deborah) Banks of Annapolis; Grandmother of Killian Banks also from Baldwin, NY; Aunt to John (Debbie) Manson of Bowie, Stacey Manson of Delaware and Mark (Pam) Townsend of College Park; Sister in Law to Etta Manson also of Delaware. Ginny had been battling Covid for a few weeks and was almost through that when she suffered a stroke at her home and was taken to Doctor's Hospital. She remained there for sixteen days and then was transferred to Waugh Chapel/Genesis nursing facility where she ultimately passed. Ginny was born Virginia Kent Manson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 18th, 1919 to Minnie Heurd and Robert Garrett Manson. Robert was a Railroad engineer. The family moved to Washington, DC and Ginny attended Eastern High School where she graduated in 1936. She subsequently went to the Washington School for Secretaries where she became proficient in typing and shorthand. Ginny started out as a Kelly Girl working different assignments all over the Washington area but ultimately took her first full-time government position with the FDIC. From there she left and took a position with the National Defense Commission (War Production Board). shortly thereafter, she worked with the DOD (US Engineering Corp), and was stationed in Bermuda during the second world war. Ginny married her first husband Robert in Bermuda and took his last name Glenn. After the war, Ginny worked for the Alien Property Custodians in New York City. She separated from her husband and moved back to Washington, DC. She soon accepted an assignment with the State Department in Montevideo Uruguay workingfor the ambassador, Christian Ravndal. She met Walter Banks, a Uruguayan businessman at an embassy function, and married him shortly thereafter. She left government service to raise two children in Uruguay but remained active in the ex-pat community. Running the embassy thrift shop for charity and actively involved in the American Women's Club. She later separated from her husband and returned to the United States with her two children. Ginny went back to government work at the department of Health Education and Welfare and Office of Management and Budget. She later transferred to the Central Intelligence Agency as director Frank Carlucci's Administrative Assistant for many years. Ginny finished her career with the Pentagon and retired in 1985. Throughout her life Ginny has always been hardworking, dependable, generous, helpful, and kind. She held on to her independence until the very end and was lucky to have the wonderful support of family and friends that allowed her to stay in her home in College Park for over fifty years. Ginny has always had a remarkable sense of humor which she used to reckless abandon. She loved music and was always singing, whistling, or humming at different stages of her life. No matter what was going on she was always of good cheer and that reflected on everyone that had the good fortune to spend time with her. She will be sorely missed by all. The family has elected to not have a formal funeral service at this time but reserves the right to have a Memorial at some post-Covid date as well as a 101st birthday party in Ginny's honor. Please stay in touch with the family if you wish to be included. In lieu of flowers we are requesting donations for the College Park Food Bank.

The arrangement came about because I was doing a lot of art presenters conferences where artists from all over the world come to perform for arts presenters and promoters and show buyers that are looking for acts to book and you basically have less than five minutes to show what you do. So I had to come up with an arrangement that could basically showcase the different things that the ukulele can do in less than five minutes. I was prepping for an arts presenter conference in New York when a group of guys that had a ukulele program for television asked me to play a song for their show. I played that tune, it aired on television in 2005, and someone put the clip on YouTube -- and the rest is history. It opened up all these doors for me.

Because of the hemp’s similarities to cannabis, farmers need to apply for a license.


  Ohio Farm Bureau spokesman Ty Higgins met with a hemp farmer in Kentucky this month to learn more about what it’s like to grow hemp.


  “There are lot of steps to take in order to be able to grow hemp, but he said the process is relatively easy. There’s a little bit of paperwork but there’s not a lot of red tape.”


  Higgins said after getting a license, farmers can still run into some challenges.


  “This farmer in Kentucky was pulled over because of the odor coming from the back of his truck when he was hauling hemp that he was licensed to plant, to grow, to harvest, and to transport. He had all of his paperwork on him, but a cop that smells it on the back of your truck doesn’t know that.”


  Higgins said the Farm Bureau still has more to learn about hemp and its market possibilities before sharing that information with the state’s farmers.

Bolsonaro has faced fierce criticism of his handling of the health crisis, and changed health ministers twice in the midst of the pandemic. Yet his popularity is at its highest since he took office in January 2019, which political analysts attribute to his distribution of emergency cash to help tens of millions of poorer Brazilians withstand the economic downturn. Some 40% of Brazilians surveyed by pollster Ibope rate their government as good or excellent, according to a poll published Sept. 24 that has a margin for error of 2 percentage points. “Bolsonaro helped the population to open their eyes.

FALL RIVER - Hang tight, all you drivers heading north on William S. Canning Boulevard en route to SouthCoast Marketplace.


  It won't be long before your final approach to the popular shopping center in the city's far South End becomes easier and safer.


  Preliminary work is now underway to construct a slip ramp, also known in the parlance of road construction as either a slip lane or slip road.


  "It will alleviate congestion and improve access to SouthCoast Marketplace," said Paul Ferland, who oversees Fall River's sewer and water divisions in his role as the city's community utilities administrator.


  Ferland says the new ramp, or lane, will sit parallel to the shopping center's main entrance-and-exit road and will run adjacent to the Santander Bank branch.


  The new road will be functional before the arrival of Thanksgiving on Nov. 26, he said.


  Ferland said northbound and southbound drivers exiting nearby Route 24 will appreciate the road addition, as will people driving in from Tiverton and down the Canning Boulevard/Route 81 hill from the Stafford Road rotary.


  The new entrance road will eliminate the need for northbound traffic to swerve into the right-hand lane to enter the shopping center -- which in turn should create a more orderly and safer two-lane path for drivers heading past SouthCoast Marketplace.


  "I know a lot of people will be happy when this is done," said John Perry, director of the city's Department of Community Maintenance.


  Ferland said the state's Department of Transportation has approved plans and designs for two new, large traffic signal lights to be installed at the intersection in front of SouthCoast Marketplace.


  He says synchronization of the lights will be fine-tuned to create a more orderly flow of traffic from various turn lanes.


  Another road improvement soon to be undertaken will be the extension of the left-turn lane onto Newton Street from northbound vehicles on Canning Boulevard, which Ferland says will be accomplished by utilizing portions of the existing median.


  "It will help avoid having traffic backing up into the high speed lane," Ferland said.


  Up until now, he said, it's been a case of "too much traffic in an under- designed intersection."


  Ferland, 37, said the slip lane is more or less the icing on the cake of a $5 million project on the boulevard that started a year ago.


  In addition to roadway repaving it's also included the replacement of old and antiquated stormwater mains with new pipes.


  Those water mains, Ferland said, run south from Tucker Street to Newton Street, the latter of which ends as it intersects Canning Boulevard at the entrance to SouthCoast Marketplace.


  New stormwater infiltration devices, or basins, that drain water directly into the ground -- to lessen the burden on the city's sewer and wastewater system -- have been installed, as have 500 linear feet of piping running from catch basins to the infiltration area.


  The boulevard drainage system, which includes catch basins, manholes and pipes, ties into the sewer main on Tucker Street.


  Ferland stresses that the improvements made last winter to the drainage system were an important step in eliminating flooding during and after high- intensity rainstorms.


  He said the section of Canning Boulevard that runs in front of CVS on one side and the First Ford auto dealership on the other had for many years been prone to severe flooding, often resulting in a road closure and detours.


  The road paving improvement project has also included the installation of new sidewalks and bike lanes, Ferland said.


  He said the road and wastewater improvement project was made possible by a $2 million MassWorks state grant awarded to the city three years ago.


  Ferland said the grant was awarded based on the development of Southcoast Marketplace and other retail-oriented, economic development improvements -- including the opening of a new Ocean State Job Lot store on the opposite side of Canning Boulevard.


  "The MassWorks grant was the driver for the project," he said.


  "We," he said, meaning the city, "piggybacked on their construction project."


  Ferland said the sewer department enterprise fund, which utilizes fees paid by city residents, provided the $2.5 million needed for the drainage improvements.


  He says the city eventually received a $400,000 grant as part of the state's Complete Streets Funding Program, which MassDOT says is intended for "technical assistance and construction."


  Ferland said the nearly $5 million contract was awarded to K.R. Rezendes Inc. of Assonet. He said the local construction company handled the drainage work and hired subcontractors to do the paving.


  He also said the property owner of SouthCoast Marketplace is covering some of the cost of the new slip ramp.


  Ferland was appointed community utilities administrator a year ago when his predecessor Terrence Sullivan retired.


  He says former city engineer Byron Holmes, who retired in 2016, has provided consulting services for the William S. Canning improvement project.


  Fall River has lacked a full-time engineer since JR Frey left earlier this year for a similar job in Hingham.


  DCM director Perry said it may or may not be obvious to most drivers, but the right-turn entrance off of southbound Canning Boulevard into the Fall River Shopping Center parking lot has been shortened and widened for ease of use and safety.


  Perry, 45, has worked for the city for 21 years and headed up DCM during the past four years.


  "We're on the home stretch now, which is great," he said, referring to the Canning Boulevard improvement project.


  "It's been a collaborative effort," he added.

Spent a little time the last few mornings sitting on my front porch.


  I left my phone in the house, took a cup of coffee and the almost famous dogs — Sarge and Bentley — with me, and we just sat outside enjoying the cool mornings.


  Actually, that’s not correct. I was sitting. Sarge and Bentley? Not so much.


  My dogs are true East Texas Couch Hounds when they’re inside, content to snooze the morning away on the couch, recliner or my lap. But let them out the door, and they turn into the canine version of the Energizer Bunny.


  Sarge is almost 9 and has slowed down a little, but he’ll still chase a bird or squirrel if one dares to enter his yard.


  We adopted Bentley, so I’m not sure exactly how old he is, but anything that moves outside is fair game. He chased his shadow for a solid three minutes one morning while Sarge simply looked at me with an “Is it too late to send him back?” expression on his face.


  Pretty sure my big brothers looked at my dad that same way a few times when I was little. Probably more than a few.


  I’m not sure why I don’t do this more often. I love my little house and the comfort and security I feel inside, but I always learn something when I pull up a chair and observe life from my front porch.


  Take birds, for instance.


  I’m not sure how many different species of birds are in and around my yard, but it seems like dozens on any given day. Some are beautifully colored. Some are very plain, and others are downright ugly. Some sing beautifully, and some are a little hard to listen to. But, they sing anyway, and they all seem to have a good time.


  Evidently, it doesn’t take much to make a bird happy. A little sunshine, a little food and some good friends to hang out with who don’t worry about color, appearance or talent.


  People could learn a lot from birds.


  From Sarge and Bentley, I get a reminder about patience and persistence.


  Sarge tolerates his “little brother,” as long as Bentley doesn’t scare off the bird or cat he is stalking, and Bentley never gives up on his quest to catch one of the squirrels that frolic about — even though he has about as much chance of catching one as I do.


  I also learn about people.


  There’s a four-way stop sign on the corner where I live. About half the people who come down my street blow through the signs without slowing down. Some slow down a little to check for the police, but don’t come to a complete stop. Others stop, look in both directions and then move along.


  That’s life, I guess.


  Some folks simply can’t be bothered with rules, even those put in place for their safety and the safety of others. Others really want to follow the rules, but only when it’s convenient for them, and there are people who would never think of breaking the rules.


  I’ve been all of the above at certain points in my life, so I try not to judge anyone. But, I will say this without hesitation.


  If you’re one of those people who speed through life and never slow down long enough to listen to the birds singing, or watch puppies play in the yard or wave at someone sitting on the front porch enjoying a cup of coffee, you don’t know what you’re missing.


  Heck. If I could teach Sarge or Bentley how to make coffee, I’d probably never leave my porch again.

The new mum also reflected on the highly publicised origins of her relationship with Karl Stefanovic, co-host of _The_ _Today Show. _
 The Channel Nine presenter met shoe designer Yarbrough onboard a luxury cruise ship in Sydney in 2016, five months following his divorce from his wife of 21 years, Cassandra Thorburn.
 At the time, Karl's detractors thought he had moved on from his marriage too quickly and their relationship became the catalyst for an onslaught of media attention, intense scrutiny and the ruthless intrusion of their personal lives.
 Since then, they've fielded many scandals along the way, starting from when the couple was forced to go public with their relationship in 2017 when they were pictured in Bora Bora on James Packer's yacht.
 "I had been mainly back and forth from overseas from the age of 20 and had no idea how popular Karl was in Australia. So I was in shock when he used to get chased by paparazzi when I would come home for a visit from LA. I remember turning to him one time and saying, 'What's going on? You're not Brad Pitt'."
 Jasmine continued: "I think the hardest part was dealing with misconceptions and untruths. You just have to focus on the people that know you and love you."
 Despite it all, the couple remained strong and they married in a lavish three- day wedding ceremony in San Jose del Cabo, Mexico, in December 2018.

Eleven candidates are in the running, and the favourite is Akinci, 72, a Social Democrat who favours loosening ties with Ankara, which has earned him the hostility of Erdogan.


  The negotiations aimed at reunification stalled during Akinci's term of office, notably on the question of the withdrawal of tens of thousands of Turkish soldiers stationed in the TRNC.


  Turkey supports the nationalist Tatar, 60, currently "prime minister" of the breakaway north.


  "We're actually choosing the president who will be negotiating with the Greek Cypriots about the future of Cyprus, so I think that it is important," said one voter, Esat Tulek, a 73-year-old retired public servant.

  If no candidate wins at least 50 percent of the vote, the two leading candidates will face off in a second round on October 18.

Ralph Meisenheimer, Republican candidate for Marion County Pct. 3 commissioner, is running for office not only to help enhance the county road system but improve the county, as a whole.
 Meisenheimer is running against Democratic candidate Corey Watson in the Nov. 3 General Election.
 “I want to better our county and better the roads, if I can,” said Meisenheimer, 67. “I’m not saying the guys aren’t doing a good job now, but I’m doing what I put my knowledge for, to better my county and city.”
 Meisenheimer is knowledgeable with the county road system, as his background consists of working as a supervisor with a county road and bridge department and in a private construction business. He believes his expertise would be a great asset in the role of county commissioner.
 “I worked for Harrison County road and bridge for ten years and was road supervisor for Precinct 3 and worked closely with my commissioner and took care of all roads, culverts, ditches right-of-ways and everything for that precinct; and it was overseen for the commissioners court,” said Meisenheimer.
 He also built county roads during his tenure there.
 “I wasn’t a commissioner, but I worked with them a lot on issues they had going,” said Meisenheimer.
 Meisenheimer said the private construction work he did prior to working with the Harrison County road and bridge department also involved some work repair similar to what he did with the road and bridge department.
 Outside of work, Meisenheimer served on the Cypress Valley Navigation District Board for about six years, representing Marion County concerning the maintenance of Cypress Bayou Basin and Caddo Lake portions within the boundaries of Harrison and Marion Counties.
 “I sat on Cypress Valley Navigation District Board and a lot of that stuff is similar,” Meisenheimer said of the decision-making process. “You’re making decisions that relate to the county.”
 Meisenheimer said, if elected, his main goal would be to bring some order to the way the county road system is addressed.
 “I just want to get all our roads up to snuff. There’s been lots and lots of complaints in that precinct about nobody’s getting anything done,” he said. “I’m not laying blame on anyone in particular, but we’ve got to make a change and do something, get organized and get some things done.”
 “We’ll have to create a work schedule, start having some progress … get a work schedule going where we’ll keep up with what’s bad and what we’re fixing,” said Meisenheimer.
 The candidate said he believes he can help meet the needs of the county by offering a new perspective.
 “I’d be a fresh man in there,” said Meisenheimer.
 Meisenheimer said as commissioner he’d have an open ear to listen to concerns.
 “We worked on complaints,” he said of his past work experience. “You have to take care of your people first.
 “If you’re not available or can’t keep in touch with them, things aren’t going to work,” said Meisenheimer.
 As a lifelong Marion County resident, Meisenheimer said he’d be proud to represent his home. His family has a rich legacy in Jefferson, dating back to his great grandfather and grandfather, who was assistant postmaster for 45 years in Jefferson.
 “I’ve lived here most of my life, born and raised here; it’s been my county,” he said. “I want to turn it into as good as it could be — make it great again.”
 Meisenheimer is a husband, father of two adult children and has three grandchildren.

It has been a long standing tradition in Ghana that in the strongholds of the two major political parties, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC), it does not matter whose picture appears on the ballot paper. Once the individual belongs to the popular political party, it is an automatic win. This happens in both presidential and parliamentary elections. While the negative effects of this may not be much felt in the development of the constituencies in the presidential elections, the effects are much more felt and disastrous in the parliamentary elections.

Former Gov. John Kasich is teaming up with former Ohio State University President Gordon Gee, who is currently president of West Virginia University, to fight for what could be hundreds of billions of dollars in opioid settlement money.


  Kasich is lobbying for hospitals to get a big portion of the money out of the national lawsuit.


  Kasich says hospitals and health systems can use the potential settlement money to advance treatment for opioid abuse and reduce fatal overdoses. "We don't want to wake up one day and figure out that with the settlement money only 50% of it went to people who were providing the services," Kasich said.


  A plan is pending that could allow more than 30,000 municipalities to get in on the money. Dozens of states, including Ohio, have raised objection to that plan.


  Critics, such as Attorney General Dave Yost, say Kasich's new group is a dark money organization that focuses too much on one aspect of the opioid epidemic, ignoring others such as law enforcement.

On Saturday, they joined other southern Louisiana residents starting the routine yet again: dodging overturned cars on the roads, chain-sawing fallen trees, trudging through knee-deep water to flooded homes with ruined floors and no power, pledging to rebuild.


  Edwards said 3,000 Louisiana National Guard soldiers were mobilized to clear roads and distribute meals and tarps.


  Delta rapidly weakened once it moved onto land and slowed to a tropical depression Saturday. Forecasters warned that heavy rain, storm surge and flash floods continued to pose dangers from parts of Texas to Mississippi. Forecasters said remnants could spawn tornadoes in Tennessee Valley into Sunday, and flash floods could hit the southern Appalachians.


  Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, was the 10th to hit the mainland U.S. this year, breaking a record set in 1916, Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach said.


  The governor said Delta disrupted state efforts to set up temporary housing in southwest Louisiana to bring back Laura evacuees scattered across hotels. More than 9,400 people were being sheltered by the state Saturday, but only 935 were Delta evacuees, Edwards said. The others were still displaced by Laura.


  Many people who had started repairing their homes from Laura saw the work undone overnight and the materials they bought “just scattered about because of the wind," he said. “Again, it’s going to set us back, but it’s not going to dictate our future.”


  The the double punch of the storms — on top of the pandemic — has left many reeling, said Lake Charles resident Katie Prejean McGrady.


  She was nine months pregnant when she and her family evacuated ahead of Laura. They fled a couple hours north and she had to find a new doctor to deliver her baby. They lost part of their roof, their fence and their swing set.


  They arrived back in Lake Charles last weekend and had to evacuate again days later, debris from Laura still in their yard.


  “I’m taxed out. And I think that’s most people in town,” she said. “There’s a mental exhaustion that sets in and then there’s a fear of ‘Does anybody outside this region care?’”

And the Prime Minister's deputy spokesman dug his heels in claiming hospitality venues account for the 'highest rates of common exposure to Covid-19, especially for those under 30 years old'.
 His claim comes after enraged MPs slammed the Government for presenting the 'early analysis' figures to them, and criticised officials' decision to include a three-month-old American study from which they cherry-picked the figures to bolster their claims.
 The slides - marked 'Cabinet Office' - also claimed claimed food outlets and bars made up as much as 41 per cent of transmission among the under 30s. But this was in stark contrast to Public Health England's own data, which suggested only four per cent of Covid-19 outbreaks can be traced back to the venues.
 The NHS coronavirus app was revealed yesterday to have sent only one alert related to one venue since its launch two weeks ago, despite millions of check-ins and more than 16million downloads.
 Shadow digital minister Chi Onwurah told Sky News this was a 'plain contradiction' of the Government's claim hospitality venues were a major source, and said ministers 'need to get a grip'.
 After ministers confirmed they will not shut schools, experts have argued they have few options left in terms of where to close to reduce social interaction, which is where the virus spreads - meaning the axe may fall on the hospitality sector. Many scientists have, however, argued against tightening the measures - and urged ministers to instead try to learn how to live with the virus.
 Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty briefed 149 MPs from the North and the Midlands yesterday to tell them that a 'significant proportion' of exposure to coronavirus was happening in the hospitality sector.
