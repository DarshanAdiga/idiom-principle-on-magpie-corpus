The mother of a 17-year-old accused of killing two demonstrators in Kenosha, Wisconsin, is among those slated to testify Friday during a hearing in Illinois to decide if her son should be extradited across the border to stand trial on homicide charges.


  Kyle Rittenhouse’s lawyers also planned to call an expert on self-defense, a prison-safety consultant and two former homicide detectives in a long shot bid to convince Judge Paul Novak in Waukegan, Illinois, not to turn their client over to Wisconsin authorities.


  The case has become a rallying point for some conservatives who see Rittenhouse as a patriot  who was exercising his right to bear arms during unrest in Kenosha following the shooting of a Black man by a white police officer. Others portray him as a domestic terrorist who incited protesters by showing up wielding a rifle.


  State-to-state extraditions are typically formalities and judges rarely refuse to OK another state’s request to transfer a suspect. Efforts to fight extradition are nearly always in vain but can help attorneys to buy time to compile evidence and prepare a defense.

Fall sports teams at Rhode Island College have been keeping busy by staging intrasquad scrimmages where the team names were Gold, White, or Maroon. The game reports distributed by the RIC sports information department featured a who’s who in area talent.


  In men’s soccer, former Tolman High standout Luis Blanco registered a team- high 10 shot attempts for Team Maroon in a 5-2 loss to Team White. The 2018-19, R.I. Gatorade Boys Soccer Player of the Year, Blanco transferred to RIC after spending his freshman season at Franklin Pierce University.


  In goal for the winning White team was freshman Andrew Silva, who hails from Cumberland and was one of the key reasons why St. Raphael captured the 2019 Division III boys soccer title.


  In women’s tennis, North Smithfield native Hailey Raskob was part of the winning No. 1 doubles team for Team Maroon, which fell to Team Gold, 5-4. Raskob is now a senior at RIC. Amiah Sommer, a freshman from Cumberland, was part of a winning doubles team that featured a victory with fellow freshman Anna Vygoder on the opposing side.


  For women’s volleyball, Mount St. Charles product Kaylin Labreche dished out 17 assists and six digs as a senior setter for a Gold team that was swept by Team Maroon (25-23, 25-23, 25-17).


  • Just for this Saturday’s 2 p.m. Division I boys soccer game at Max Read Field, two fans per Tolman High player and two fans per St. Raphael player will be permitted to attend. It will mark the first time this season that fans are allowed to watch a high school soccer game from the stands in Pawtucket.


  • The Pawtucket Red Sox are partnering with the Boys & Girls Club of Pawtucket and Stop & Shop to conduct a Drive-Thru Halloween event at McCoy Stadium. From 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. this coming Saturday, youngsters and families from Pawtucket and Central Falls are encouraged to stop by with the idea of celebrating Halloween in a safe fashion.


  Stop & Shop donated 2,500 bags that will feature a combination of healthy snacks, juice boxes, bottled water, hand sanitizer, and candy. Similar to the food drives that took place earlier this year, the goodie bags will be distributed in the McCoy parking lot.


  Saturday will mark the 107th time that something has taken place at McCoy since April.


  • We know that high school football in Texas is king. We just didn’t know it was an expensive venture. Per a July 2019 article in the Houston Chronicle, a stadium that opened in 2017 cost $70.3 million to build. One that opened in 2018 cost $70 million.


  Remember, we’re talking about high school football.


  With news coming out of Worcester this week that the process of laying the sod down at Polar Park has commenced, here’s a friendly reminder that the Ballpark at Slater Mill would have cost $83 million – $45 million from the PawSox, $15 million from Pawtucket and $23 million from Rhode Island. A ballpark, mind you, that would have been used far more frequently than a few Friday nights in the fall and perhaps for high school graduation ceremonies.


  • I can hear the non-sabermetric believers screaming “I told you so!” after Rays manager Kevin Cash decided to abruptly pull the plug on Blake Snell in Game 6 of the World Series.


  • It only took a month for Cam Newton to go from the toast of the town to Patriots fans clamoring for Bill Belichick to really see what New England has in Jarrett Stidham.


  • This column would have been longer, but with the R.I. Interscholastic League releasing the dates and brackets pertaining to the playoffs, I’m keeping a good thought that reach the finish line and actually crown champions.

The production is almost oppressively scaled- down, relying on handheld cameras and masterful editing to give Camille's perceptions and memories a fractured unreliability. She sees ghosts, not as glowing apparitions but as people in the room with her when they should not be. She remembers things out of order, and she focuses — in that the camera focuses — on details that don't seem important until later. The jangly quality of the filmmaking suits her scattered state of mind. But there is no grand or greedy attention to the fact of cutting or the sight of blood. Those things are, suitably for a crime story, evidence, more than anything. They're the visible record of Camille's life to this point and the pain that she's endured.

The Panthers had opened a 14-6 lead in the second quarter when Bridgewater found Curtis Samuel for a 29-yard touchdown pass on a well set up flea flicker. It was Samuel’s second TD of the half, scoring earlier on a 12-yard run up the middle to give Carolina its first lead.


  The 24-year-old Samuel has three career games with a TD rushing and receiving, which trails only Jerry Rice (5) among wide receivers in the Super Bowl era.

The GARD idea is weird enough, and Rollins is a good enough storyteller, that the narrative remains unpredictable. That keeps things interesting when Walton's endless self-recriminations get to be too soggy. In truth, this book's greatest weakness is its protagonist. Walton was once a brilliant young scientist, but he's never stopped regretting his involvement in the GARD program — and although Rollins suggests this regret is what's turned Walton into a washed-up alcoholic, it's hard to imagine any better fate for such a sad sack. His fellow scientist Marc may be more evil, but at least he's not a sap.

  # Letter: Change Port Hueneme council


  Ventura County Star


  View Comments


  Port Hueneme residents must focus their votes on the city’s future. Residents must ask themselves, what’s working for the residents and what’s not? To find something that is not working you only need to look at the past accomplishments of the two incumbent candidates.


  One incumbent candidate has spent 12 years on the city council, yet councilmember Sylvia Muñoz Schnopp still struggles to name one revenue accomplishment that she has sponsored, other than the two sales tax increases for this small community composed mainly of retirees, working class residents and military service members. She even resisted creation of the city’s cannabis policies.


  Will Berg has also not shown any ability to deliver on behalf of the city. Other councilmembers complain that his interests are only for items that benefit his former employer, the Port, and that he poses as an obstacle in the council’s effort to gain a new and more fair agreement with its Port ally. Councilmember Berg, who still receives payments from the Port, has proposed that the city deal’s exclusively with the Port as the city decides on development of its two remaining valuable vacant parcels of land. The Port should be provided with the opportunity bid on city land development projects. But giving the Port exclusivity will create another horrible mess like the county of Ventura created with developer exclusivity for Fisherman’s Wharf.


  Residents don’t want more of the same. We need plans for the anticipated encroachment on our competitive advantage in the cannabis industry. And we need additional funding for the police, not promises of support. We need our council to focus on our city’s poor air quality. Imagine, the most industrialized city in Ventura County is still without an Air Quality Monitoring Station? We need new and energetic leadership on the council.


   _Ellis Green, Port Hueneme_
