 # Creating, scoring off fumbles big part of Howell's football success

 HOWELL — Howell’s football season was one yard away from being put to rest.
 Defending a fourth-and-1 from their own 34-yard line last Friday at Hartland, the Highlanders needed to get a stop to have any chance of coming back in their first-round state playoff game.
 But merely getting a stop isn’t good enough for Howell this season. With Hartland quarterback Holden D’Arcy lunging forward toward the first down, linebackers Marcus Chidester and Noah Ramonaitis combined on a tackle and forced the ball loose.
 Linebacker Danny Honkala recovered it with 1:46 remaining, setting the stage for a game-winning drive in a 21-16 victory.
 For any other team, getting a fumble at an opportune time could be chalked up as the breaks of the game.
 For Howell, it’s by design.
 Every team works on creating fumbles, but few are as proficient as the Highlanders. Howell has recovered 13 fumbles in seven games, scoring touchdowns on four of them. Two were fumbles in the end zone, while two were scooped up and returned for scores.
 “For those things to happen, you’ve got to work at it,” Howell coach Brian Lewis said. “Those are the things we work at in our practice. You don’t just happen to get turnovers. You’ve got to work on scooping and scoring, you’ve got to work at those skills and those specific skills. So, those are things we do all the time for those opportunities, for those moments. You see the hard work pay off.”
 Two fumbles played a huge role in the outcome last week.
 Honkala returned a fumble for a touchdown for Howell’s first score of the game in the second quarter, tying the game 6-6. Honkala’s second recovery set up Jackson Kovarik’s winning 30-yard touchdown catch with 22.4 seconds left.
 “We always wrap up first,” Honkala said. “The second guy comes in and rips. That’s what we work on. It’s a big impact in the game. It’s crazy how much one fumble can impact a game.”
 Chidester has four fumble recoveries, Honkala three and Ramonaitis two. Honkala has scored two touchdowns on runbacks. Three times in seven games, the Highlanders’ first points have been scored on a fumble recovery returns.

 “Any time the defense can put points on the board, it’s always a huge momentum swing,” Chidester said. “That takes pressure off the offense to score. It’s just unexpected, so it’s a big play when it happens. Against Novi and Hartland, we scored, and it changed the momentum of the game.”
 Howell’s defense will be looking to make more big plays in its second-round playoff game at 7 p.m. Friday at unbeaten Lakeland.
 “Obviously, everyone made the playoffs Week 1, but we played well,” Chidester said. “We survived and advanced to Week 2. We just want to prove ourselves that we’re here to stay.”
