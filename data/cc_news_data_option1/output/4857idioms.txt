The future is also nostalgia-driven – Peacock’s next big swing is _Bel-Air_ , a dramatic reboot of the classic NBC sitcom _The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_. The series tells the same story but as a drama and is based off a viral video a fan self-produced. After original lead Will Smith got involved, the show sparked a bidding war and Peacock won.
 But again – it’s not a reboot for reboot sake. It’s a reboot with a mission.
 (Credit - Westbrook Studio)
 And I’m also not saying Peacock needs to be entirely reboot driven, there are flaws with that approach as well. Though by taking older trends and turning them on their head it does set things apart from its rivals.
 It also gets people to sign up, yes granted we don’t if that sign-up results in a paid subscription or not, but if you are being driven by a _Saved By The Bell_ or _Bel-Air type_ series then it changes the narrative. Peacock doesn’t need to be Netflix, it just needs to build a roster and build an identity.
 There’s something to be said about looking to the past to solidify your future – after all those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.

India’s Gross Domestic Product growth rate contracted by 7.5% for the second quarter (July-October) of the current financial year, government data showed on Friday. With this, the country’s economy slipped into a technical recessionary phase for the first time ever.
 India’s economy had contracted by an unprecedented 23.9% in the first quarter (April-June) of this financial year, after being hit by the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent economic slowdown. Technically, a country’s economy is said to hit recession when its GDP growth is negative for two consecutive quarters or more.
 The second quarter GDP numbers are below the Reserve Bank of India’s estimation, made earlier this month. The central bank in a bulletin had predicted that the growth rate will contract by 8.6% in the second quarter.
 The RBI had, however, noted that the contraction is “ebbing with gradual normalisation in activities and expected to be short-lived”.
 Earlier on Friday, government data showed that India’s fiscal deficit in October stood at Rs 9.53 lakh crore, or 126.7% of the budgeted target for the whole fiscal year, reported Reuters.
 The Indian economy, which was already slowing down before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, dipped to all-time lows, in terms of GDP numbers in the first quarter with economic activities stalled due to the nationwide lockdown imposed in March. Various financial institutions have predicted that India will register a negative growth rate in the full financial year 2020-21.
 Last week, global forecasting firm Oxford Economics said in a report on Thursday that India will be the world’s worst-affected among the major economies even after the coronavirus pandemic weakens.

And then if you want it commercial-free, it’s another tier.
 Honestly, I can’t blame them for the commercial-free tier being an upcharge. For those who hate commercials they’ll gladly pay $10 a month. It’s the $5 mid-tier that has rubbed some people the wrong way, mainly because the shows in that tier haven’t been worth it. On top of that the other perks which are detailed here just aren’t enough for the average person to add another streamer to the mix.
 Enter _Saved By The Bell_.
 The 90s sitcom about high school teens is as iconic as it is repeated – for a while it looked like it was the only show cable network TBS actually had in its catalog. The more remarkable thing is the series only had 86 episodes – not counting the prequel series _Good Morning Miss Bliss_ and primetime spin- off _The College Years_ , both lasting just a season.
 Regardless, this is a show that has legs… serious legs.
 It is a series deeply rooted in the NBC family and what the Peacock team (smartly) realized was if any network was going to reboot it, it should be a streamer. This was one of my favorite shows growing up, but even I’ll admit had this been on the NBC primetime roster it would have likely been one-and- done.
 Remember the _Murphy Brown_ reboot?
 That was another show with legs and one that broke through on a national scale – especially after former Vice President Dan Quayle famously picked a fight with it over a plot-point. Yet the reboot the other year crashed hard and again, as a fan of the show it was hard to watch because I have such fond memories of it in its prime.
 The point is had that gone to CBS All Access vs. CBS proper, maybe it would have been a different result. After _The Good Fight_ is still thriving after all these years and if you think about it, the audience isn’t really that different.
 With _Saved By The Bell_ though the problem Peacock had – as does anyone using nostalgia as a hook – is it has to be done right. This was not a show you could slap a fresh coat of paint on and expect it to sell. The producers realized that and they did go to great lengths to make an effort.

This is an issue that James Dunstan, the principal attorney at the space law firm Mobius Legal Group, has been grappling with for years. On Earth, international maritime law allows sailors to salvage wreckage they find at sea, but Dunstan says that under the Outer Space Treaty, an international agreement signed in 1967, spent rockets remain the property of whoever launched them. Under this law, if a company or country were to take over an abandoned rocket stage without permission, they would be trespassing on the property of the launching state. But Dunstan describes this interpretation of the law as a fallacy, because, he says, "neither the launching states nor launching companies really care about the spent stages. They'd love for them to go away."

Japanese knotweed is exceptionally strong and its roots are capable of growing through concrete, drains, mortar, brick and even cavity walls.
 The weed is incredibly hard to control, as its underground roots grow stronger and faster than the above-ground plant visible to gardeners.
 A previous study by scientists at Swansea University found the plant is impossible to manage with standard measures. After 19 attempts, they failed to control it.
 Nic Seal, founder of Environet UK, specialises in removing the entirety of the plant. This can involve bringing in heavy machinery including diggers to extract vast chunks of dirt.
 Every single part of the plant must be removed, leaving just a fragment of a root the size of a fingernail can see it return with a vengeance.
 As a result of its persistence and strength, it has increasingly become a concern for homeowners.
 Mr Seal told MailOnline that the increasing awareness of the weed and the dangers it poses means sellers should be honest about any infestation.
 'Now more than ever it's vital that sellers are honest and declare that there is, or could be, knotweed growing on their property,' he says.
 'Awareness among the general public is now so high and there's such a strong precedent set in the courts that it's likely they will end up paying the price further down the line if they answer dishonestly or claim not to know of its presence.
 'In fact, it's quite easy for a Japanese knotweed expert to tell how long an infestation has been there and, in encroachment cases, the source of the infestation.'

Manila, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 27th Nov, 2020 ) :Two fugitive communist rebel leaders in the Philippines who had been involved in failed peace talks to end one of the world's longest-running insurgencies were convicted of kidnapping on Friday, officials said.
 Benito Tiamzon and his wife Wilma Tiamzon were freed on bail in 2016 to help out in negotiations in Norway to end the conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.
 But President Rodrigo Duterte shelved the talks in 2017, alleging the Maoist leaders were not interested in making peace. The couple have been on the run ever since.
 Duterte later signed an order declaring the Communist Party of the Philippines and its 3,800-member armed wing the New People's Army (NPA), which the Tiamzons both allegedly led, "terrorist organisations".
 The couple were sentenced in absentia to 40 years in jail after a court found them guilty of abducting four soldiers near Manila in 1988.

The 67-year-old is now coordinating the setting-up of six vaccine hubs in Berlin in a convention center, two former airports, an ice skating rink, a concert hall and an indoor cycle race track.
 Authorities want them ready by mid-December to begin vaccinating more than 3,000 people per day at each location. With just a few minutes to deliver each shot and mindful of keeping the number of people in each center at a minimum, Broemme and his colleagues are devising a one-way flow system similar to that found in large stores like furniture company Ikea.
 Each site will be run by a medical aid group, such as the Red Cross, with volunteers to help register and guide people through the venue.
 Like elsewhere, the first phase of vaccination in Berlin will likely focus on immunizing health care workers and vulnerable groups such as the elderly and those with chronic illnesses. About 20,000 people will be vaccinated each day, returning after three weeks for a booster shot.
 Demand is likely to outstrip supply at first, but that will change as more vaccines come onto the market.
 "We're hopeful that approvals in the field of vaccination will be issued very quickly," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told parliament on Thursday. "That won't solve the problem immediately, but there's a light at the end of the tunnel."
 Broemme has said he expects four-fifths of the vaccines initially available to need ultra-low cooling. That means every center will need a pharmacy that handles both the storage and thawing of vaccines.
 At the other end of the country in Tuttlingen, Binder GmbH, one of hundreds of medical device manufacturers in the town, some with a history dating back to the 19th century, is seeing demand for its freezers surge.
 Priced at 13,000-15,000 euros ($15,500-17,900), each device can keep tens of thousands of vials of vaccine at optimum temperature, says Peter Wimmer, the company's head of innovation.
 "It's plug and play," he told the AP. "All you need is an electrical socket, switch it on and the device is ready to go."
 Having the whole vaccination system ready to go at the touch of a button is a different matter, though.
 It is still unclear who will actually administer the vaccines in Berlin. Unlike Britain, which has a centralized National Health Service organizing the immunization drive, Germany is relying on doctors associations to provide the necessary medical staff.
 Doerthe Arnold, a spokeswoman for the Berlin branch of Germany's Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, said they are still waiting for the state government to provide details on what will be required of doctors.
 "Despite the positive feedback from doctors practices that they're willing to help out even more, providing medical personnel for the six vaccination centers will be a challenge," she said.
 The limits of medical logistics were tested in spring, when huge worldwide demand for ventilators, therapeutic drugs, face masks and other protective equipment prompted bidding wars, bottlenecks and reports of faulty products.
 Global logistics company DHL estimates that to provide worldwide coverage of vaccines over the coming two years may require 15,000 flights.
 "The challenge is the sheer number of doses and the fact that it's not clear which vaccine needs to go where," Sabine Hartmann, a DHL spokeswoman, told The AP. "It's not something a single company can do on its own. All logistics companies have to work together on this."

Thanksgiving is an invitation to stop and reflect on life and to gain perspective- especially in 2020. As I harvested my horseradish this November I received that invitation myself. Is it possible that a spicy root like horseradish has a gift in store for us beyond just the sauces, flavorings, and sinus cleansing properties it is well known for?
   
 Anyone one who has grown horseradish is familiar with the vigorous nature of this plant. I've had a healthy crop in my own backyard for the last several years, and it is likely I'll never be without it again. The vigorous rooting and spreading of the horseradish plant is considered beautiful to some gardeners and a nuisance to others.
   
 November is a great time to discover the hidden glory of this persevering plant. The roots are ready to be dug up after a hard freeze in the fall to reveal just how much growth has occurred over the past 12 months. After I removed the frost killed leaves I was absolutely amazed at the rooting depth of my horseradish. Honestly I couldn't even get to the bottom of the longest root, but after a healthy time of digging I was able to unearth a plump root of approximately 2 feet in length.
   
 This root went right into my kitchen to be put to use and did not disappoint. Once the root is cut or grated, the enzymes of the plant go into action and produce allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil) which irritates the mucous membranes of the sinuses and eyes. This chemical reaction, which is how the plant defends itself in nature, actually becomes a productive feature in the kitchen and throughout history has even been considered medicinal in many cultures. It was certainly medicinal for me; I don't think my sinuses have ever been clearer.
   
 But where horseradish shines and has interesting implications for us people who find ourselves in the middle of a year with a pandemic, politics, and many personal proclivities is in its ability to persevere, grow deeply, and remain inwardly and productively potent -- almost as if the suffering and adversity is driving its growth.
   
 I rarely give my horseradish much care, yet each fall I unearth the same deep and reformed roots from the small root pieces left over and replanted from the previous fall. Amazingly within 12 months these root fragments find a way to grow to their full potential and potency in the less than ideal conditions they are forced to endure.
   
 There is absolutely a truth found here for those curious and present enough to see and observe it. In many ways 2020 has been a year of much less than the ideal. There has been intense adversity and loss for the majority of people I know. This is a time when horticulture and the plant world could and should be a "go to" for us.
   
 Could it be true that the human spirit can also grow deeply and in its productive potency through adversity and suffering? I think so. Horseradish does it by nature, but we humans have a choice in it and that is where we must start. A choice to rethink or have new thoughts may be in order, a decision to notice and open up an invitation that has been sitting in my life for some time unseen or not responded to. Horseradish grows deeply and with potency right where it is placed, it simply can't change the soil (circumstances) it is given. I argue that people have the same ability and our world simply needs more of these deep and potent people.

“I know it is frustrating for people when they are in a high-tier area when there is very little incidence in their village or their area. I totally understand why people feel frustrated,” he said during a visit to a public health laboratory in Wiltshire.
 “The difficulty is that if you did it any other way, first of all you’d divide the country up into loads and loads of very complicated sub-divisions – there has got to be some simplicity and clarity in the way we do this.
 “The second problem is that, alas, our experience is that when a high- incidence area is quite close to a low-incidence area, unless you beat the problem in the high-incidence area, the low-incidence area I’m afraid starts to catch up.”
 Mr Johnson said more mass coronavirus testing is in the pipeline and the supply of quick-result tests is not an issue, with the UK set to make its own within months.
 The Prime Minister said: “We’ve got tens of, perhaps hundreds of, millions of lateral flow tests coming into this country. We already have a huge stockpile.
 “The difficulty is not the supply at the moment, the difficulty is actually working with local government, local communities to get them doing it.
 “Liverpool already showed the way. We’re now looking at Barnsley, Doncaster and other places around the country where they want to pull together and do it.
 “Just now, in this lab here in PHE (Public Health England) in Porton Down, I’ve been talking to some scientists – we are seeing real progress on a UK- made lateral flow test.
 “We’re now quite there yet but in the months ahead we’ll be making them in this country as well.
 “So the supply I don’t think is going to be the problem. The issue is going to be getting everybody mobilised, to understand the potential advantages of mass community testing.”

VANCOUVER - City councillors in Vancouver voted unanimously this week to ask the federal government to decriminalize small amounts of illicit drugs for personal use, a decision advocates hope will blaze a trail in other municipalities.
 It's within Health Minister Patty Hajdu's power to grant an exemption to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to allow decriminalization across Canada, said Sandra Ka Hon Chu, the director of research and advocacy for the Toronto- based HIV Legal Network.
 "She can issue a very sweeping exemption across the country, and that would be the ideal outcome," said Ka Hon Chu, who is a lawyer.

Griffin has been tirelessly hashing out this problem with other, similar-size cities, he says, but so far has only come up with a suggestion that we sell The Joe and the Volvo tennis stadium on Daniel Island. Which his colleagues frowned upon Tuesday afternoon.
 The councilman may have to tweak those ideas once he gets his own city. Most fiscal advisers discourage the use of capital money for operating expenses. You know, since you can only do that once.
 But perhaps Charleston County government would help out Griffin’s new town, as it subsidizes the town of James Island, another haven for anti-Charleston sentiment. It would be hard to make an outer West Ashley town profitable otherwise.
 See, residential property taxes don’t cover the costs of municipal services in the suburbs. And there's not much of an industrial base in outer West Ashley. Although they do have a Walmart Supercenter that probably generates a fair chunk of change.
 Of course, Griffin knows all this. And being a student of history, the councilman undoubtedly understands secession is fraught with problems — even if there's only a remote possibility that Mayor John Tecklenburg would launch a cannon assault on Griffin and his confederates if they attempt to nationalize the Bees Ferry Road Fire Station.
 Griffin has a tough row to hoe if he goes the secession route, but surely he has thought out all the angles. He wouldn't just throw around idle threats.
 And while we will miss any of our neighbors who choose to wagon train it on out of Charleston, we should simply bid them adieu and wish them well. We don't need another decades-long James Island coup.
 Of course, Griffin is right. This could solve everyone's problems. If all the folks in his council district leave the city, the rest of Charleston residents will be off the hook for that $50 million-plus Church Creek flooding mitigation.
 We could not only avoid increasing taxes ... we could actually cut 'em.
 Because then that problem would belong to Griffin … and the new town of Waterworld.

Max was a Rottweiler that I saw about 15 years ago because of a severe lameness, which turned out to be because of osteosarcoma affecting his leg. He was an older dog, was overweight and had multiple orthopedic issues affecting virtually all of his joints. To say the least, he was not a good candidate for amputation. When we saw the X-rays, it was pretty clear what was wrong, but because amputating his leg would be so hard on him, we decided to biopsy the bone tumor first.
 A bone biopsy involves using a trephine. Think of those big tubes that we drill into the earth to obtain core samples. As you can imagine, these are disruptive to tissue, and the body will react to this trauma with an inflammatory response. This also can trigger an immune response.
 In Max’s case, the biopsy confirmed our suspicions, but since he was continuing to use the leg, and there is no real advantage to early amputation, we decided to wait and buy a little time.
 The problem was that not only did he _not_ get worse, he started doing better. Weeks rolled past and we decided to get another X-ray, and we were stunned by the results. The tumor lesion had completely resolved.
 I did a little research, and found that there were a few cases in which an osteosarcoma lesion was biopsied, and this was followed by spontaneous resolution of an otherwise deadly cancer. Since Max’s case, I have had two additional cases of osteosarcoma, and one of an equally serious intestinal cancer, that resolved following biopsy harvesting. So, what happened?
 My best guess is that in the course of obtaining the biopsy, there is a disruption of the cells, and the body reacts to this invasion.

 Thanksgiving is an invitation to stop and reflect on life and to gain perspective- especially in 2020. As I harvested my horseradish this November I received that invitation myself. Is it possible that a spicy root like horseradish has a gift in store for us beyond just the sauces, flavorings, and sinus cleansing properties it is well known for?
 Anyone one who has grown horseradish is familiar with the vigorous nature of this plant. I've had a healthy crop in my own backyard for the last several years, and it is likely I'll never be without it again. The vigorous rooting and spreading of the horseradish plant is considered beautiful to some gardeners and a nuisance to others.
 November is a great time to discover the hidden glory of this persevering plant. The roots are ready to be dug up after a hard freeze in the fall to reveal just how much growth has occurred over the past 12 months. After I removed the frost killed leaves I was absolutely amazed at the rooting depth of my horseradish. Honestly I couldn't even get to the bottom of the longest root, but after a healthy time of digging I was able to unearth a plump root of approximately 2 feet in length.
 This root went right into my kitchen to be put to use and did not disappoint. Once the root is cut or grated, the enzymes of the plant go into action and produce allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil) which irritates the mucous membranes of the sinuses and eyes. This chemical reaction, which is how the plant defends itself in nature, actually becomes a productive feature in the kitchen and throughout history has even been considered medicinal in many cultures. It was certainly medicinal for me; I don't think my sinuses have ever been clearer.
 But where horseradish shines and has interesting implications for us people who find ourselves in the middle of a year with a pandemic, politics, and many personal proclivities is in its ability to persevere, grow deeply, and remain inwardly and productively potent -- almost as if the suffering and adversity is driving its growth.
 I rarely give my horseradish much care, yet each fall I unearth the same deep and reformed roots from the small root pieces left over and replanted from the previous fall. Amazingly within 12 months these root fragments find a way to grow to their full potential and potency in the less than ideal conditions they are forced to endure.
 There is absolutely a truth found here for those curious and present enough to see and observe it. In many ways 2020 has been a year of much less than the ideal. There has been intense adversity and loss for the majority of people I know. This is a time when horticulture and the plant world could and should be a \"go to\" for us.
 Could it be true that the human spirit can also grow deeply and in its productive potency through adversity and suffering? I think so. Horseradish does it by nature, but we humans have a choice in it and that is where we must start. A choice to rethink or have new thoughts may be in order, a decision to notice and open up an invitation that has been sitting in my life for some time unseen or not responded to. Horseradish grows deeply and with potency right where it is placed, it simply can't change the soil (circumstances) it is given. I argue that people have the same ability and our world simply needs more of these deep and potent people.

Despite a global pandemic getting in the way of many things this year, many Salina shoppers will keep things local once again this Small Business Saturday.
   
 The Saturday after Thanksgiving is a time for people to celebrate and help local businesses, and with so much uncertainty this year, that means even more to those businesses and to the local economy.
   
 "There was an American Express study in 2018 that ... said that 67 cents of every dollar stays local if it's bought at a local small business," said Eric Brown, president and CEO of the Salina Area Chamber of Commerce.
   
 Brown said he wishes that, during the holiday season and throughout the year, people think of Salina first when it comes to where and how they spend their money.
   
 "I'm hopeful that people will be cognizant about spending their funds and going the extra mile to double check and see if they can get their product here locally," Brown said.
   
 Thinking about and spending money locally is even more important this year. A proclamation for Small Business Saturday read during the Salina City Commission meeting on Nov. 16 said that 62% of small businesses in the country said they need to see spending return to pre-COVID-19 levels by the end of the year to stay in business.
   
 Penny Bettles, executive director of Salina Downtown Inc., said this year is going to look different for shoppers and businesses, but there are still many ways people can help. A lot of merchants this year have moved to online sales as well as in-store sales.
   
 "You can shop safely at home for Shop Small Saturday, online," Bettles said.
   
 Bettles said that throughout the pandemic, local businesses have found ways to reach people through e-commerce with things like Facebook Live tours of their shops.
   
 "They'll walk through the whole store with you and show you their inventory," Bettles said.
   
 People can comment during the broadcast on Facebook to ask questions or to have the shop set things aside to pick up later.
   
 "There's a lot of curbside ... pickup, and those sort of things," Bettles said.
   
 Local restaurants, another important piece of Small Business Saturday, are finding ways to feed and reach out to the community as well.
   
 "The restaurants are really emphasizing their cleanliness," Bettles said.
   
 She said local food establishments are cleaning and sanitizing surfaces constantly and are also offering ways to eat and drink without having to sit down in the restaurant.
   
 "They're doing curbside pickups (and) partnering with EatStreet for deliveries," Bettles said. "Most of our bars and restaurants are offering some sort of drinks (or) cocktails to go."
   
 Bettles said she is hopeful this year's Small Business Saturday will be a success. Downtown Salina businesses have open houses throughout the holiday season, the first one having been at the beginning of November, which Bettles said was successful.
   
 "Typically, Shop Small Saturday is very similar to a downtown open house," Bettles said. "Merchants will have special (and) discounts throughout the day."
   
 One of the biggest benefits of shopping locally is the experience of it, and while this Small Business Saturday experience will look very different from previous years, Bettles said people can still find a unique and safe way to spend their dollars in Salina.
   
 "You get more of a one-on-one experience when you go to a local store, rather than at a big box store," Bettles said. "I feel like it is much safer to shop at one of our smaller downtown businesses, when there's only ... two or three other people in the business with you, as opposed to a larger establishment that might have 100 other people."
