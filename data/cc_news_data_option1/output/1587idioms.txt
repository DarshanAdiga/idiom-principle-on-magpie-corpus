“We were going to open it up Monday (April 13), but the mayor and (City Manager John Benson) decided to keep it closed for right now.”
 The city, according to Puente, is planning on taking advantage of the closure to perform some much-needed maintenance to the dilapidated facility.
 “What are plans are, and we’ve been working on this for the last two years, is to redo all the plumbing in the golf course, all of the water lines and all of the sprinkler heads and all of the satellite boxes that control the sprinkler system,” he said. “We’re going to redo the whole thing.”
 He estimated the city had about $80,000 in reserves that is earmarked for maintenance to the course and that some other work has already started, including the trimming of trees and some cosmetic improvements to the clubhouse.
 “We’ve been needing to do this awhile,” Puente said.
 Beeville’s other golf course, the private Beeville Country Club, is also closed indefinitely.
 It shut down operations at the same time as the city-owned course in response to Gov. Greg Abbott’s statement that golf courses are considered non-essential businesses.
 Abbott’s original order was unclear on the status of golf courses, but the governor, in a conference call with local leaders from across the state on April 7, stated that golf courses should not be considered essential businesses under his March 31 executive order.
 The City of Corpus Christi, however, is actively ignoring that statement and a verbal order from Nueces County Judge Barbara Canales to shutter its golf courses for the time being.
 As of press time, the city’s two courses, Lozano Golf Center and Oso Beach Municipal Golf Course, remained open with City Manager Peter Zanoni saying that Canales’ order was only a verbal change to her original written order and that the city is only required to follow the written order.

"We’re in a preparation phase for the second stage — I’m not talking about going back to normal life — we don’t know how long it will last,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on a visit to a supermarket in western France to thank staff who have continued to work amid the lockdown.
 Talk of a return to business as usual was scarce in the U.K. too. The government warned Britons they face a prolonged period of social and movement restrictions as officials struck a downbeat tone. The U.K. also reported an increase in new confirmed cases, with 4,451, for a total of 133,495.
 The European Commission, the EU’s executive, floated a €2 trillion ($2.2 trillion) plan for economic recovery as leaders prepared to discuss ways to jolt the trading bloc out of the paralysis caused by the lockdowns introduced to contain the pandemic. The direction of the response may hinge on Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling party is at odds with its coalition partner over the next phase of stimulus measures.
 The EU’s 27 heads of government will hold a video conference Thursday to discuss new measures after stringent lockdowns shuttered factories and halted travel, pitching the world’s largest trading bloc into the worst recession in living memory. The EU expects output to contract by as much as 10 percent this year, according to an official.
 The richer northern EU members have been resisting pressure for new financing structures to help reconstruction in the southern countries hardest hit by the virus. The compromise proposal, set out in an internal commission document seen by Bloomberg News, would partially use the EU’s existing seven-year budget and also establish a new financing mechanism.
 But in Germany, Merkel’s Christian Democrat-led bloc is pushing back against immediate new stimulus demanded by its Social Democratic partner. The debate risks reopening old wounds after Germany’s grand coalition — which seemed to be coming to an end only a few months ago — closed ranks in the fight against the coronavirus.
 The reluctance to commit to more spending so soon after countries across Europe already announced unprecedented fiscal measures goes to the heart of the issue dividing the continent.
 France, Spain and Italy have called for the EU to introduce joint debt sales but governments in Germany and the Netherlands have rejected so-called coronabonds over fear they’d be stuck with the bill. The pressure to act is increasing as the costs of halting large swathes of the economy become clearer.
 "We have to be careful not to introduce each week a new measure followed by another measure the next week,” Merkel said Monday.

FRUITLAND — The next leader of Fruitland School District became official on Monday, as the Fruitland School District Board of Trustees approved of the contract for Lyle Bayley.
 Bayley will be replacing Teresa Fabricius, who announced in January that she would be retiring at the end of the 2019-20 school year.
 Fabricius has been superintendent since 2012, and has worked at Fruitland School District in multiple positions for nearly 30 years.
 On March 18, Bayley agreed to a two-year contract with Fruitland School District with an annual salary of $111,150. He was previously the superintendent of Castleford School District in Idaho and was the principal at Kuna High School before that. In the 2017-18 school year, Bayley had a salary of $95,000 at Castleford School District.
 That same year, Fabricius was making $95,930.
 The average superintendent salary in Idaho is $108,249. Bayley is scheduled to start as superintendent on July 1.

About 20 friends escorted Dr. Magda Graif, 89, to her final resting place on Wednesday, after she was found in her Beersheba home on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day, over a week after she fell and died on the eve of Passover, according to Ynet.
 Graif was a pathologist at the Soroka Medical Center and a lecturer at Ben Gurion University.
 "She was my teacher and established generations of students," said Dr. Nitzan Heiman-Neuman, one of those who took part in the funeral, according to Ynet. "She called us 'my children.' She had dark humor, we spoke with her about everything, she was a big personality even though she was small physically."
 "Magda was a woman with a colorful personality but she loved purple. Everything was purple by her. Even when she taught us with slides the frame was purple, so I bought her purple flowers," said Heiman-Neuman, who brought a wreath to the funeral.
 Rabbi Avraham Yosef, who called emergency services after Graif didn't answer the door when he knocked, paid last respects at the funeral as well.
 "There was the symbolism of a person who had gone through the Holocaust and rebuilt herself from scratch," said Avi Boganim, who knew Graif through Yosef, according to Ynet. "She didn't rehabilitate and revive herself, but also revived others."
 "Graif did not have any children, but she went with a lot of children who she revived. Therefore, many people are thought of as her children and owe her," said Boganim.
 Graif was found just days after ZAKA volunteers were called to an apartment in Petah Tikva where a woman suffering from mental illness was trying to comfort and feed her 70-year-old mother who had passed away over a week before.
   
 ZAKA volunteers have handled 35 incidents so far in 2020 in which those living alone have died alone. In 2019, 130 people died alone.
    On Holocaust Remembrance Day, Gesher MK Orly Levy-Abecassis lamented that "they found another elderly person, 89 years old, who was a Holocaust survivor, lonely, who was a doctor in hospitals in Israel and a lecturer, and it turns out that she had already passed away on the eve of Passover, but this loneliness takes a precious toll and until the smell rose they didn't know about this most terrible thing."
 "In order that events like this not happen again, not in the Jewish State and not in any other normal society, it is on us to ensure that all the public and social services know about these elderly people, these people who are in need and alone." said Levy-Abecassis. "Loneliness kills and it does so mercilessly."

“I didn’t want out-of-towners getting tempted to come to Beeville because our golf course was open,” Puente said. “As bad as at that sounds, I just didn’t want the course to be open and it just be an invitation for people from out of town to come to Beeville just because of the possibility of them spreading their germs here.
 “Everyone is on edge about that.”
 Puente said that he had received at least half a dozen complaints from members of the community, including business owners who wanted to know why they were forced to close but the course remained open.
 He said he originally told those folks that golf was an outdoor activity and that the government actually encouraged cities and counties to keep the park systems open to the public.
 However, it was quickly brought to Puente’s attention that the golfers were not abiding by social distancing protocols.
 “They took pictures of them grouping up in certain spots. It just looked bad,” he said.
 The plan, Puente said, tentatively put in place on April 7 to close the course for just the Easter weekend was quickly amended when the first case of COVID-19 in Bee County was confirmed the following day.

What do I mean by holding? In psychology, the term has a specific meaning. It describes the way another person, often an authority figure, _contains_ and _interprets_ what’s happening in times of uncertainty. Containing refers to the ability to soothe distress and interpreting to the ability to help others make sense of a confusing predicament. Think of a CEO who, in a severe downturn, reassures employees that the company has the resources to weather the storm and most jobs will be protected, helps them interpret revenue data, and gives clear directions about what must be done to service existing clients and develop new business. That executive is holding: They think clearly, offer reassurance, orient people and help them stick together. That work is as important as inspiring others. In fact, it is a precondition for doing so.

Then on May 1, restaurant dining rooms, movie theaters, sporting venues and gyms can reopen. Places of worship can again hold in-person services and meetings provided staff and volunteers wear masks and abstain from serving food or coffee, sanitize between services and keep nursery areas closed, Stitt said.
 Stitt said Friday’s reopening allows communities that don’t have more restrictive closure guidelines in place to open sooner.
 But come May 1, Stitt said he intends for Phase 1 to be implemented statewide.
 “Right now, we’re going to let some municipalities make some decisions before May,” he said. “After May 1, it’s our intent to really move to Phase 1 all across the state. We think we have pretty much broad buy-in and the data really confirms that.”
 He said the state’s reopening plan is based on data that shows Oklahoma’s total hospitalizations peaked March 30 and have continued to trend down for the entire month. A graph he displayed did show a spike in hospitalizations Tuesday.
 Stitt also said the number of new cases is continuing to decline. The state tracks that number on a rolling average. Even as more people are tested, he said the numbers are trending down.
 The goal of nonessential business closures was to flatten the expected hospitalization curve and prepare for a surge in patients. That’s worked, so the state can implement a measured business reopening plan at this point, Stitt said.
 “We will continue to watch the data each day, and we will pull back if necessary,” he said. “We are making decisions for Oklahomans based on the data for our state and to protect the health of Oklahomans.”
 But Dr. George Monks, president of Oklahoma State Medical Association, said Stitt’s plan to reopen “is hasty at best.”
 “Even without widespread testing, Oklahoma has seen an ongoing growth in the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the past week alone,” he said. “According to the Trump administration, states should not begin this process until they’ve seen a two-week downward trajectory in COVID-19 cases, and we are far from this point.”
 As of Wednesday, the state Department of Health reported 2,894 Oklahomans had tested positive for COVID-19. That’s up from 2,807 the day prior. On Wednesday, 298 Oklahomans were hospitalized. That was down from 346 Tuesday.
 The number of deaths, though, grew by six.
 Monks said Oklahoma’s doctors and nurses continue to care for those who are ill from the “savage disease."
 “To increase the danger of widespread infection by opening prematurely not only discounts their efforts, but also the sacrifices made by their loved ones,” he said.
 He said the business closures put in place have made a difference in the fight.

STURGIS — The COVID-19 pandemic has forced some Sturgis businesses to close and others to scale back on the services they can provide, it’s inevitable that in the coming months, the city of Sturgis will see a dramatic downturn in the amount of sales tax it collects.
 Sturgis City Manager Daniel Ainslie said at the Sturgis City Council meeting Monday that the city is not currently looking at furloughs or lay-offs of city employees in light of the anticipated sales tax dip.
 “At this time, ‘no,’” Ainslie said. “We do have a very healthy reserve, and all the department heads have already been instructed to look at ways to continue to save money.”

Participating by phone were Board of Works member Robert Haywood; City Council members Tammy Davis, Tracey Hawkins and Gale Ryan; City Planner Steve Bingham; City Attorney Cedric Hollabaugh; Street Superintendent Eric Dohner; Wastewater Superintendent Brian Moore; utility consultant Dave Wagner; and Paul Elling from Donohue & Associates.
 No citizens attended in person or participated by phone.
 All votes were conducted by voice roll call.
 By a 5-0 vote, the City Council extended an executive order issued Friday by Hartman making a local disaster emergency declaration. That action was necessary, as Hartman’s order lasts for seven days.
 The extension of the local disaster emergency makes Butler eligible for federal funding should it incur any expenses related to the pandemic. As of Monday’s meeting, Eck said Butler had not incurred any expenses.
 Hartman said the city will wait to see if Gov. Eric Holcomb lifts his executive order limiting the number of people for public gatherings, such as for city council meetings, on May 1. If the order is not lifted, future meetings will be held by conference call. Butler’s parks and recreation board will conduct a virtual meeting April 28.
 By another 5-0 vote, Davis, Hawkins, Johnson, Ryan and White approved the first reading of an ordinance addressing the use of tents, RVs, vehicular and accessory structures within the city limits.
 The ordinance was created to address complaints from neighbors about some people using RVs or tents as their primary residences, Nichols and Hartman explained. The police department had received four complaints in the last 10 days, Nichols added.
 The use of a tent, trailer, RV, vehicular or accessory structure would be permitted for up to three consecutive nights in the backyard of residential areas or on land with permission of the property owner, unless prohibited by a subdivision covenant. Camping is not permitted in parks or on city-owned land.
 If people don’t have a place to sleep, Nichols asked that they call or come to the police department for resources. Hartman added that one church has stepped up to help an individual.
 The ordinance does not apply to commercial truck stops. Passage on two additional readings, plus a public hearing, are required before the ordinance becomes part of city code.
 Another of Holcomb’s executive orders during the pandemic prohibits all utility shut-offs. Eck shared a proposal with the Board of Works that would give delinquent utility customers time to pay their bills.
 As of Monday’s meeting, Eck said, 44 customers had not made utility payments. Without the executive order, their service would have been shut off.

President Donald Trump laid out new guidelines last night that align with Idaho’s approach to responsibly reopen our economy in stages.
 Like all our previous actions where we followed CDC and Presidential guidance, the new plan is in lockstep with the approach we have been pursuing in Idaho.
 On Wednesday, April 15, I announced initial steps toward safely reopening Idaho’s economy in phases based on Idaho-specific data. Our goal is to avoid a spike in severe cases, which will set back our economic recovery.
 My amended order, which is in place until April 30, allows any business, facility or service to open for curbside and delivery service. Further, businesses can now prepare to open their doors after April 30 as long as they make preparations to meet certain criteria for social distancing, sanitation, and others. For now, this excludes certain businesses where people simply cannot safely social distance.
 Our approach allows us to further assess the trajectory of cases in Idaho and continue to strengthen our healthcare and testing capacity – just as the President’s guidelines recommend.
 I’ve heard from neighbors, parents of school children, and small business owners. I share their concerns and frustration. It breaks my heart to see years and sometimes generations of hard work be plundered by the pandemic. No one wants to get our economy back up and running as much as I do, but we simply cannot open everything all at once and reverse the good work we have done collectively over the past month to slow the spread of coronavirus.
 Today, there is no vaccine. There is no therapeutic to relieve symptoms, and we are far from achieving herd immunity to the virus.
 But the President’s guidelines confirm Idaho is focused on the right areas for improvement, including expansion of testing access and contact tracing, increased healthcare system capacity, protecting the health of critical workers and vulnerable citizens, and reinforcing personal actions to prevent spread.
 Our shared efforts to “flatten the curve” are working, but we have not yet seen a prolonged downward trend of severe cases – as recommended by the President – to justify opening up everything at once.
 Until we do, we must continue to stay the course and proceed in an objective, organized manner toward opening the economy.
 We all must ramp up our actions to slow the spread of coronavirus so that we can minimize the potential for future waves of infections and ensure a strong economic comeback as quickly as possible.
 As advised by the President, we are taking this a few weeks at a time. Before the end of the month, I will lay out our next steps for the May.
 I have spent the past couple of weeks with business leaders across the state, and next week I will announce the formation of an economic recovery group made up of private sector folks who will help guide us.
 Just like Idaho rebounded from the last recession, prudent action today will allow Idaho to catapult forward with broad economic prosperity. What we are doing now is difficult, but I have no doubt Idaho will be one of the leaders in recovering from coronavirus.
 Thank you to the people of Idaho for doing an incredible job protecting your loved ones, your neighbors, and yourselves during this unprecedented time.

Hasta hace relativamente poco, la palabra _cancelación_ era el puro demonio. Se la esqui­vaba, desoía y denostaba. Ser realista y advertir en los círculos de la cultura de los beneficios de pasar al plan B ante el ritmo actual de la pandemia del coronavirus te convertía automáticamente en agorera. A día de hoy, en cambio, artistas, equipamientos, programadores y personal implicado en la actividad de las artes escénicas y la música en vivo suplican al Gobierno que anuncie, por lo que más quiera, un calendario concreto de desescalada de la pandemia. Y no en dosis homeopáticas como lo viene haciendo, sino mirando al horizonte, fijando una fecha para que, con la ley en la mano, todo el mundo pueda proceder a cancelar festivales de verano y programaciones de otoño. Ya a partir de ahí, imaginar otras realidades.

McLaughlin said people in Spearfish or Black Hills State would not have treated her any differently.
 “There are bigger things in life than just your athletics,” McLaughlin said in referring to the current COVID-19 pandemic that has closed schools and canceled all events. “I feel so bad for all the athletes that can’t compete now, but it is something that you can move on from.”
 When she was a senior, she motivated herself by having the number “55” everywhere as a reminder of her shot put distance goal. “It’s actually still written in my car,” she said.
 Senior year was a “now or never” proposition for McLaughlin as far as achieving goals was concerned. She sought a school psychologist to help with mental and visual work, which she had never done before.
 “You enter the gym in a different manner,” she said in describing the results. “You’ve got to set an example and really try to work your hardest, because you never know when it’s going to be your last track meet or workout.”
 Schools are currently challenged by teachers and students not being able to see each other every day. Zoom meetings take the place of typical classroom sessions.
 McLaughlin said the parents are really supportive, and almost all students enjoy internet access. She added the most difficult adjustment centers on teachers and students not being able to have that daily contact with one another.
 “I try to make it as normal as possible,” McLaughlin said in describing a typical day. That includes taking morning walks on the family farm 15-20 miles outside of Wall.
 She checks her emails and holds Zoom meetings until around 1 p.m. A day finishes one or two hours later.
 Life lessons from Black Hills State days serve McLaughlin well.
 “I really try to preach to all my kids to live in the moment,” she said. “Never take for granted what you’ve got now, because in an instant it can change.”
 Another Wall native, Kyla Sawvell, has enjoyed success at Black Hills State in the throwing events. McLaughlin is happy for the person she has known for a long time.
 McLaughlin has words of advice for athletes struggling with losing their senior seasons.
 “You’ll get through it,” she said. “Continue to take in every moment. Live it to the fullest, because you never know when something like this could happen again.”

Of those four seniors, Ashley Hofmeister has decided not to return to UW-Whitewater, Kristin Bowe will return and Kelli Storti plans to return if she’s accepted into her graduate school program at UW-Whitewater. The Warhawks will not be granted an automatic bid into the 2021 tournament based on their 2020 performance. Instead, they’ll have to win their fourth WIAC title in a row in what will be Wieland’s fifth year as head coach.
 “We had a record-breaking year and, more importantly, the team chemistry was amazing,” Wieland said. “Everyone was on the same page, even the freshmen that were sitting on the sideline waiting to become the future of our program. That’s what made this year so special. That’s also what made it so difficult when it was yanked away so quickly.
 “We were planning to have a strong finish at nationals and were working hard toward our goals.” These girls have definitely learned not to take one day or one season for granted through all of this; but I definitely think golf prepared them mentally to handle all of these things.”

Crider said he was “extremely disappointed” with the way his team finished down the stretch. The Lady Yellow Jackets had chances to wrap up either the No. 2 or No. 3 seed in the 50th District but suffered a loss at home to Corbin and a road loss to Whitley County that led to them receiving the No. 4 seed.
 "The Corbin loss at home was the toughest pill to swallow,” he admitted. “I still don’t like to think about it. It took me a solid week to be able to move on. I felt like we had the team to make it to The Arena. I just couldn’t find the right button to push for us to click and get over the hump. I felt and feel awful that I let the team down."
 The loss to South Laurel in the district tournament also signaled the ending of the high school basketball careers of Lillie Hall, Zoe Williams, Allison Caddell and Madison Chapman.
 "It’s going to be real tough on and off the court. Three of them had been with me since I got here,” Crider said. “Being their coach through their whole high school career and being a part of the things they accomplished will be something I never forget.
 “I mean Lillie Hall is Lillie Hall,” Crider added. “Being able to have coached one of the best players to have played not only at Williamsburg but in the region is something cool. Zoe Williams is one that came to us between her sophomore and junior year and is just an amazing person who has a great heart. Allison Caddell was a warrior who always gave it her all. She would beat and bang with anyone and I mean anyone. Madison Chapman didn’t get to show what she was completely made of until her senior year but man her basketball IQ is second to none.”
 Despite the losses of a talented senior group, Crider believes his team can remain competitive next season.
 "It’s going to take a lot of new faces in new places working extra hard but they can do it,” he said. “Things have happened over the last four years that has never happened in school history, so we must continue to develop the players and see what happens."

The dollar pushed ahead against the currencies of oil producers on Thursday as a rebound in crude prices from an unprecedented collapse only partially calmed markets unnerved by the massive coronavirus-led drop in global demand.
 The euro held steady against the greenback and the pound ahead a of meeting of European Union officials on the bloc's response to the economic turmoil caused by the global coronavirus pandemic. Analysts say sentiment is still supportive of the U.S. currency because the coronavirus outbreak is driving a global depression, which will encourage investors to opt for the safety of holding their funds in dollars.
 "The dollar is a bit of a phoenix-type character; it seems to keep coming back," said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank in Sydney. "I'm still of the view that the dollar rally is on borrowed time, but there are still signs of stress, and it's not clear that the dollar shortage has been addressed for everyone."
 The U.S. dollar edged up against the Canadian dollar to C$1.4177 following a 0.3% decline on Wednesday. The greenback held steady at 24.4710 Mexican pesos, close to a two-week high.
 Against the Norwegian crown, the U.S. currency edged up to 10.7706, near a one-month high reached on Wednesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures rose 4.21% to $14.36 a barrel early in Asian trading on Thursday. On Monday front-month WTI futures fell to around minus $40 as a glut of oil and dwindling capacity to store it sent oil prices into a tail spin.
 Brent crude has also managed to rebound from the its lowest level since June 1999. These gains pale against persistent investor concerns about the collapse in demand for oil, as major economies have been brought to a virtual standstill with stay-at-home rules and severe restrictions on businesses and travel to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
 Countries are running out of space to store the oil that they are not using, which could lead to further disruptions for commodities and other markets. Officials from the EU will discuss the bloc's response to the economic damage caused by the coronavirus later on Thursday.
 However, markets are wary because it is uncertain how far EU governments will cooperate in financing the recovery from what is sure to be a deep recession. Ahead of the outcome of the meeting, the euro edged lower to $1.0807. Against the pound, the common currency was little changed at 87.77 pence.
 The European Central Bank has agreed to accept junk bonds as collateral to allow banks to finance themselves at the ECB, which should be a positive factor for the euro, but investors are waiting for details on the fiscal response. The dollar was little changed versus the yen as the pair remains stuck in a holding pattern.
 The greenback last traded at 107.83 yen. The Australian dollar fell 0.46% to $0.6294 as a bounce driven by Wednesday's encouraging data on retail sales quickly ran out of steam.
 The decline in the Aussie weighed on the New Zealand dollar , which fell 0.54% to $0.5924.

Summer school, also, is up in the air.
 “We don’t want it to be online if we can help it,” said Wilson. While summer school for students that have fallen behind in their grades is generally offered in June after the school year closes, this year there is a possibility it will be held in August before the 2020-21 school year starts.
 Meanwhile, no decisions have been made about graduation, currently set for Sunday, June 7. If it goes as originally planned, commencement will be held at 2 p.m. in the high school gym.
 Angola High School graduation fills the gym to maximum capacity, with people often standing outside the doors, peering over each other’s shoulders to get a glimpse of the action.
 At this time, no social gatherings are being allowed through May 1 in Indiana to help prevent the spread of virus. Monday, Gov. Eric Holcomb said the stay- at-home order could be extended further if the outbreak warrants it.
 To meet social distancing requirements, if needed, graduation could potentially be conducted virtually, outdoors or be limited to just parents spaced out properly in a large facility. While those ideas were briefly broached by Wilson during the school board meeting, no plans have been made.
 “We are going to have graduation at some point, at some time,” said Heavin, noting that purple face masks that say “2020” can be ordered along with gowns and caps.
 Kindergarten registration will likely be conducted online.
 In other business, the board accepted the retirement of business manager Monte VanGessel. Several board members took a moment at the end of the meeting to thank VanGessel for the great work she has done for the district and to wish her a happy retirement.

PARMA — The silver screen is glimmering once again in Parma as the only drive- in movie theater in the area, Parma Motor-Vu, is planning to open for the season on Friday.
 This date is over a month past the previous opening weekend date of March 27 that the theater had originally planned to be the start of the summer movie viewing season at the Motor-Vu. Due to social distancing guidelines and a stay at home order from Gov. Brad Little relating to the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, the theater had to postpone its opening.
 The first features that will mark the season opening of the theater are Disney/Pixar’s “Onward” and “The Call of the Wild.” Both films are rated PG.
 Upon visiting the theater’s website, one notices the posters for upcoming films to be played at the theater including: “Mulan” “Trolls World Tour” “Marvel Studios’ Black Widow” and “Wonder Woman 1984.”
 Karen Cornwell, former owner of the Parma Motor-Vu, answered some questions about the opening in an email on Monday morning.
 “[W]e are actually opening with much caution. Limited snack bar, dispensed out of doors. As for the upcoming movies, we know nothing. We already had these two movies for the planned opening of March 27, so [we’re] just using them,” she said.
 Since the onset of the COVID-19 public health crisis, the national and global box office has taken a substantial economic hit owing to the temporary closure of traditional movie theaters and film studios moving their high-profile movies’ release dates to later in the year and beyond.
 “We are very worried that all the summer product will be kept until fall. Disney is saying Mulan will be July 24,” Cornwell said.
 As far as the future of the movies to be offered, current theater owner and Cornwell’s daughter, Susan Haaheim, said that she won’t know anything about what movies are going to be available due to the fact that it is up to the studios to announce what their plans are for release.
 “The movies advertised on our coming soon aren’t going anywhere, just delayed. Hopefully not so far delayed that we won’t get to play them! Only time will tell,” Haaheim noted.
 The film revenue tracking website Box Office Mojo continues to report on the top grossing films in the United States despite the lack of moviegoer attendance. The most recent box office grosses listed on the site were for the weekend of April 10-12 with only two movies, both of which are in limited release, taking the top spots.

SPRINGFIELD - Illinois Senate Republicans are calling for greater communication from the governor's office when he commutes prison sentences, but Gov. JB Pritzker has not indicated he will make any voluntary changes to the process, which is spelled out in state law and also goes through the state Prisoner Review Board.
   
 The Chicago Tribune reported Pritzker commuted 17 sentences between March 11 and April 9. Another two commutations were conducted on April 13, according to the Prisoner Review Board.
   
 "We have learned through the media that you have reduced the sentences of some violent criminals, including seven or more convicted murderers," eight Senate Republicans wrote in a letter to the governor on April 16. "We are concerned that you have done so without informing the victims, their families, witnesses who testified against them, local law enforcement leaders, the judges who decided their sentences, or members of the General Assembly. Are all of these commutations because of the COVID-19 crisis? We believe that the public deserves to know."
   
 Pritzker did not directly respond Saturday to a question as to whether recent commutations were related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 The Illinois Constitution states, "The Governor may grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, after conviction, for all offenses on such terms as he thinks proper. The manner of applying therefore may be regulated by law."
   
 Pritzker pointed out Saturday that all cases also go through the Prisoner Review Board process.
   
 "So I just want to be clear that those go through the PRB," he said. "So they actually have a presentation of each case at the PRB, they vote on those cases before they ever get to my desk."
   
 The review board is an independent body made up of members appointed by the governor. Itimposes release conditions, revokes and restores good conduct credits, and conducts parole hearings. It also notifies victims and their families when an inmate is about to be released from custody and makes confidential recommendations to the governor regarding executive clemency petitions.
   
 But the Senate Republicans said the information about releases from prison should be publicly viewable in an online database and Pritzker should personally reach out to victims' families, local law enforcement leaders, members of the General Assembly, presiding judges, witnesses, and state's attorneys' offices "before making any future commutation decisions."
   
 "We don't even know everyone that they're releasing," Springfield Republican Sen. Steve McClure, who co-signed the letter to the governor, said in a phone call. "So we are not even getting the information. It is not just something that we need so that we know whether or not this is the right thing to do, but also for the safety of the public, particularly … victims, people who testified against these people."
   
 House Republican John Cabello, of Machesney Park, was also critical. He accused the governor of undermining the criminal justice system in "an unbelievable attempt to protect these prisoners from the coronavirus" as he released the names of 13 recently released prisoners last week.
   
 Prison reform and civil rights groups, however, have praised the actions on medical furloughs and commutations and even called for greater release of at- risk prisoners in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 "Releasing prisoners from these settings improves safety for other detainees, people who work in the corrections system as guards and administrators and also helps protect the communities where Illinois prisons are located," Colleen Connell, executive director of the ACLU of Illinois, said in a statement. "The people who are being released have served time - some of them years. The release of these names is not another opportunity to create faux outrage and perpetuate a criminal legal system that too often confuses being tough with being smart."
   
 The Pritzker administration also faced a lawsuit from civil rights activists seeking the release of thousands more prisoners due to health concerns earlier this month, but a judge denied the request to intervene.
   
 According to the IDOC website, as of Monday, 148 incarcerated individuals had tested positive for COVID-19 in Illinois prisons, 62 of whom have recovered, and 135 prison staff had tested positive for the virus, 35 of whom have recovered. Stateville Correctional Center near Joliet accounted for 70 of the staff and 121 of the prisoners that tested positive, with 77 combined recoveries.
   
 In a Thursday news conference, Pritzker said there are "two methods that we're following for thinking about release."
   
 "One is the director of the DOC, the Department of Corrections, has the ability on his own to determine that someone can be released and it's the criteria that he's using is non-violent convictions and people who have already served a substantial portion of their term or have a comorbidity or something that makes them especially vulnerable," he said, adding that it is essential that the person would not pose a risk to the community.
   
 On April 6, Pritzker signed an executive order allowing the IDOC director greater authority to grant medical furloughs to prisoners during the COVID-19 disaster declaration.
   
 Pritzker did not have an exact number of releases Monday at his daily briefing but said there were 1,300 fewer persons incarcerated than at the beginning of March for various reasons the last time he checked.
   
 A spokesperson for IDOC said later Monday, "The department's efforts to return people to their communities has led to either the release or home confinement of more than 760 people, and this work is continuing. To reach this number, the department is exercising the legal procedures available while placing an emphasis on maintaining public safety."
   
 Pritzker said the second method for release is appeals to the governor for clemency.
   
 "And those often are the more difficult cases. These are often people who may have committed a violent crime but it may have occurred many, many years ago, they may have served, for example, decades of a term," Pritzker said, adding he makes decisions in consultation with Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and legal counsel.
   
 Asked if the governor was considering adopting some of the procedures suggested by the GOP senators and whether more commutations are in the works, Pritzker's spokesperson said only, "The governor has clemency powers granted to him via the state Constitution. The administration has followed all appropriate procedures."
   
 In their letter, the Senate Republicans specifically mentioned Alma Durr, a mother who was charged with killing her 21-month-old son in 1996 after allegedly using crack cocaine. She was serving a life sentence before it was commuted with nine others on April 7. They alleged that Durr was leaving a prison that had no prisoners confirmed to have COVID-19.
   
 McClure said it and another case regarding the murder of a child that was in youth protective services stood out as hypocritical and dangerous when compared to the governor's previous public comments on reforms needed to the Department of Children and Family Services.
   
 "It just doesn't make any sense, particularly when the governor seems to be so outraged over DCFS cases," McClure said.
   
 The John Howard Association, an independent prison reform group, released a statement Friday with the Cook County Public Defender's Office saying commutation decisions should be based on "research and data, not politics and emotion."
   
 "Full consideration of all of the public health ramifications of this deadly disease inside prisons makes clear that each person released from prison represents an opportunity to save not one life but many lives," they said in the statement. "Categorically excluding people who have demonstrated their rehabilitation and do not present a threat to society from consideration for release solely due to the offense they were convicted of committing many years prior has long been recognized by experts as an ineffectual and ill-chosen approach to maintaining public safety."
   
 The statement said Pritzker's commutations and executive orders to expedite early release of some prisoners "are steps in the right direction that must be encouraged and increased for everyone's safety and well-being."
   
 The other Republicans who signed the letter are Jason Plummer, of Vandalia; Brian Stewart, of Freeport; Chapin Rose, of Mahomet; Jil Tracy, of Quincy; Paul Schimpf, of Waterloo; Craig Wilcox, of McHenry; and Dan McConchie, of Hawthorn Woods.

With a budget shortfall suddenly expected to grow to over a billion dollars, legislators are scrambling to assess the actual damage and come up with some possible solutions.
 “The equalization board presented some slides yesterday saying that there'll be a tremendous drop in revenue. I'm not sure what they're basing that on yet,” District 59 Rep. Mike Sanders said. “We were anticipating going into next year's budget about a $477 million shortfall, which we could have absorbed in using rainy day money, and still would have several hundred million dollars more for the 22 budgets.”
 The Oklahoma Tax Commission presented a number three times bigger than what legislators were anticipating, according to Sanders.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WAND) - Some people have stocked up on food they bought from the grocery store, but others rely on a different source of food for their health and livelihood.
 The Old Capitol Farmers Market is a staple in the Springfield Community. The market runs throughout the year, and many people rely on it for food.
 Market Manager, Kayla Graven, says the market has been running for more than 20 years.
 "In our market, last summer alone, we had over $21,000 in SNAP uses," Graven says.
 Instead of cancelling the market entirely because of COVID19, the market temporarily switched to selling products online.
 "Online alone, we had 300 orders placed," Graven says. "We started Friday at noon and we are closing it today, because we had so many orders come in, we are running out."
 Saturday, April 25, Gravens says the market will be open outdoors for the first time since Halloween.
 "Only essential vendors will be present and our booths will be spread a part," Graven says. "We also sourced cloth masks from Wild Rose, one of our local vendors, to provide for each of our vendors."
 According to Graven, this is not to be viewed as a social event but rather a source of food.
 "I know our community uses it as a social aspect, but we're telling people this is food," Graven says. "It's serious."
 Graven says the market remaining open is not only important to the local community, but to the farmers who produce those products.
 Farmer, Mitch Cave, says he has always been passionate about growing clean food.
 "[The Farmer's Market] is allowing us farmers to stay in business," Cave says. "Most of us are very small farmers."
 When COVID hit Sangamon County, Cave says he was worried about his farms future.
 "The thought was, a lot of us might loose our livelihood," Cave says.
 According to Cave, 4-Lees Farm has been in his family for generations, and he has been selling products at the Old Capitol Farmers Market for more than four years.
 "We do pasture-raised broiled chicken, pasteurized pork and grass fed beef," Cave says.
 Now more than ever, Cave says he can't thank the community enough for buying local.
 "This is our only source of income and without the farmers markets, plain and simple, we're out of business," Cave says.
 The Old Capitol Farmer's Market will be held outdoors on Saturday, April 25, from 9 a.m. until noon. The market will also offer curbside pickup.

The plan, if adopted, would give delinquent customers 30 days to contact the utility office and sign a payment plan before turn-offs would start.
 The proposed plan would offer any account at $600 or less up to six months to repay the balance; 6-12 months for any account balance between $601-$1,000; and 6, 12 or 18 months for any account balance over $1,000.
 If the utility moratorium is lifted May 1, Eck said, shut-offs would not resume until July.
 Board members Haywood and Johnson approved a $484,000 engineering services agreement with Donohue & Associates to address Butler’s long-term control plan and combined sewer overflow issues in accordance with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.
 In February, the board chose to pursue a state revolving fund loan to address the issues. In 2019, Butler had 34 CSO events, when rainfall exceeds the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant. Some events lasted a few minutes or hours, while others lasted a few days, Moore said.
 IDEM wants six or fewer CSO events per year. Butler entered into an agreed order with IDEM in 2014 to address the issues.
 By choosing the state revolving fund loan, the rate would be 2%. Hartman was appointed as Butler’s representative for the SRF application. Butler will also pursue a guaranteed savings program designed to save money.
 Elling explained the project would update equipment at the wastewater plant, expand storage and address the CSO issues.
 By phone, Elling explained the project will identify core components, with other items as alternates based on cost. “Down the line, there’s going to be a pool of money, either from the guaranteed savings or the state revolving fund,” he said.
 The project would be completed in phases.
 “We need to get with contractors as early as we can to save as much money as possible,” Elling said.
 Bingham reported on a recent meeting with the contractor about the High Street and R.E. Jones Road projects.
 Bingham said the intent is to maintain access to businesses, industries and residences along those roadways. High Street has a deteriorating concrete surface. The original intent was to grind that up and use it as base material for the new road.
 Nichols said police Patrolmen Joseph Griggs and Imad Alkhulaqi have received waivers that will extend their law enforcement powers by one year due to COVID-19.
 Griggs was nearing completion of his training at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy before classes were shut down, and Alkhulaqi was scheduled to attend the next class. Nichols said Griggs sustained a stress fracture at the academy, but has returned to work in Butler. He is awaiting word whether surgery will be required.
 Hartman announced Mike Fry will serve as Butler’s code enforcement officer, with an office at the police department. Police officers have been handling those duties since the beginning of the year.

DANVILLE, Ill. (WAND) - Eastern Illinois Foodbank has been busier now more than ever due to COVID-19.
 As of now, things have been running smoothly for the Foodbank, but they are still tackling situations one day at a time. One of the issues they are tackling is identifying where the highest need is coming from in central Illinois and to what extent with a new software they have.
 "Only 60 percent of all of our partners are using it. I think overall we are seeing a 12 percent increase of new households," said Molly Delaney, Vice President of Development for Eastern Illinois Foodbank.
 She says 12 percent of those people are people who have never used a food pantry or been a part of their program.
 "We are seeing that pretty much across the board. With the exceptions of Vermilion and Dewitt county. Dewitt county is more of a 20 percent increase in new households. For Vermilion County it's more around 30 percent," she said.
 One thing they do know for sure is that central Illinois has not been impacted as hard as some other areas in the country.
 "We are trying to look at this more long-term. We don't know really what the impact will be economical. We don't know how long it's going to take our counties to recover. It's going to be different community by community--which it always is," she said.
 As of now, it's hard to detect the exact numbers because not every partner is using it.
 "When we have the economy up and running. People will think it's over, but it really isn't for those who are going to be hit hard," said.
 However, they will be there to provide that help as they do all year-long

According to Xinhua news agency, Advent-IRBM is set to start advanced studies on its potential vaccine in conjunction with the Jenner Institute, which is part of Oxford University in the United Kingdom. Advent-IRBM has announced it would send samples to the Jenner Institute on Thursday, where it will be developed in part with local funding.The said research is based on the use of adenovirus, a mild virus that infects chimpanzees, with a genetic modification that carries part of the coronavirus.Another research team has been working at the University of Oxford.

Coronavirus disruptions have already caused farm machinery sales to plunge but it’s not certain the outbreak will destabilize the market in the long term, experts say.
 Total farm tractors sales were down 15% by volume last month compared to the previous year, while combine sales by volume fell 12%, according to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers.
 “Those March numbers just fell off a cliff,” said Curt Blades, AEM’s senior vice president of agricultural services.
 One month of sales data isn’t enough to establish a trend, especially since the financial impacts from the coronavirus outbreak didn’t hit until late March, Blades said.
 In light of the “barrage” of bad economic news, though, “it is not just business as usual,” he said. “There’s a whole lot of emotion that goes into equipment purchases as well.”
 Though crop production tends not to rise or fall sharply in the short term, growers do reduce spending in reaction to economic data, said Scott Pope, machinery analyst with the Morningstar financial services company.
 “Anytime there’s a panic, farmers — like anyone else making long-term investments — pull back,” Pope said. “It’s easy for farmers to say, ‘We’ll hold onto that tractor or combine for an extra season.’”
 The outlook for commodity crops, which affect machinery demand, isn’t positive as the outbreak’s impacts reverberate through the economy, he said.
 More than 40% of the nation’s corn goes into producing ethanol, which suffers along with oil when people drastically reduce driving, he said.
 “There’s not a huge demand for blending right now,” Pope said.
 Fuel efficiency is one of the drivers for buying newer machinery, but it’s not as much of an incentive when diesel prices are low, he said.
 Restaurant closures have reduced the consumption of meat, hurting livestock producers who are major customers of feed crops, he said.
 The percentage of crops that go unharvested may rise in 2020, reducing machinery usage and thus demand for replacement equipment, Pope said.
 Smaller farmers who are suffering financially may also be less willing to buy used machinery, which in turn makes larger farmers less likely to sell their tractors and combines to make way for new ones, he said.
 Though the immediate forecast for farm machinery sales looks bleak, the industry probably isn’t facing a “nightmare scenario” of multiple years of severely depressed demand, Pope said.
 “All the data we have now, this is looking to be a temporary phenomenon,” he said.
 Before the coronavirus pummeled the U.S. economy in March, sales of larger tractors used in commercial agriculture were stable or positive.
 Those with more than 100 horsepower saw an upswing of 13% in volume during the first two months of 2020, while sales of four-wheel drive tractors were flat.
 Tractors with more than 100 horsepower saw sales increase 3.5% by volume in 2019 while those with four-wheel drive grew by 5.6%.
 Sales of combines by volume decreased by less than 1% last year but experienced a steep 22% decline even before the impact of the coronavirus was felt during the first couple months of 2020.
 The AEM was expecting 2020 to be “a little soft” but was hoping for a “nice recovery” in 2021 based on farm income forecasts, said Blades.
 At this point, manufacturers are focused on new safety and disinfection measures to keep their employees healthy, he said.
 “The members are telling me their number one priority is to keep the supply chains open,” Blades said.

The lengthy interview which was republished in part by the Enid News & Eagle on Sunday under the headline “DEFENDING TIMOTHY McVEIGH” may have raised a question in some people’s mind about how I could speak about my client in the way that I did when Oklahoma has a rule of confidentiality and the attorney- client privilege as it relates to an accused and his lawyer.
 I failed to make clear in the interview that the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, Judge Matsch in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado and the Oklahoma Bar Association in filings with the Oklahoma Supreme Court conceded that Tim McVeigh had waived substantially all of his protection of confidentiality and the attorney-client privilege. Some of these Orders are a matter of public record, but others are sealed.
 The Courts’ rationale was that McVeigh had waived the attorney-client privilege by the selective releasing of documents and materials concerning his defense, his Motion for a New Trial filed by his post-conviction lawyers, and most importantly, 75 hours of tape-recorded interviews with two Buffalo, New York, reporters who were writing a book about his case.
 In those interviews, McVeigh discussed at length material what otherwise would have remained confidential. Case law holds that once the client has waived the privilege, it cannot be restored.

The Cowboys have always conducted a pre-draft press conference that includes both front-office personnel and the head coach. But never has it been done in this virtual format as nearly 30 media members were conferenced in via webcast to chat with Jerry Jones, Stephen Jones and Mike McCarthy on Tuesday, just a couple of days before the NFL Draft.
 Here were some of the highlights that came out of the press conference.
 Jerry Jones won't rule out anything in regards to trades, given his history in dealing picks on draft day. But he said it's "highly unlikely" the Cowboys would trade the No. 17 overall pick for a high-profile player, which has been suggested in various reports lately.
 Asked to specifically comment on Dak Prescott's availability for this week's virtual offseason, head coach Mike McCarthy reiterated he is not "taking roll" on his players, given the meetings are still voluntary. He added that Prescott has been in communication with the coaching staff during the process, without getting into specifics.
 For 30 years, Stephen and Jerry Jones have been arm in arm during draft weekend but that might change this week with both of them using virtual conferences to communicate with the rest of the staff, scouts and coaches. Jerry Jones jokingly said he's not going to miss "the kicks under the table" that Stephen would often give him to calm him down during a discussion or a trade.
 When asked to address the status of both Aldon Smith and Randy Gregory, Jerry Jones playfully tried to divert the question to Stephen, knowing that both cases are rather sensitive to the NFL and still unsettled as the two players have yet to be reinstated. "I wouldn't dare get into where the league is and how they will go about this process for both of those players," Jerry Jones said. "I will say this, as a league, we really are bent toward the medical aspect of many of these problems or many of these things that have been in consideration when a player has to have some type of suspension. We've made it more medically oriented to where you can have good grades from doctors, and that weighs into being a player in the NFL. Those guys are certainly adhering to those tests in their rehab efforts."
 McCarthy said he met with Aldon Smith back in December, long before either person was associated with the Cowboys. "I was up there on a personal nature," he said of his visit with Smith in California. "I was very impressed with everything that he's done and his path. I've always admired him from afar. Very impressive young man and I'm looking forward to working with him."
 Asked specifically on what type of defense he will play, McCarthy finally said "we're a 4-3 defense." But he added the Cowboys "may have the ability to have some variation there." All along, McCarthy has put the focus on acquiring good players over the specific scheme. Depending on what happens in the draft, the Cowboys could use more of a 3-man front, but for now, it appears the Cowboys are sticking with the four-man base defense.
 Neither Jerry or Stephen Jones commented much about Dak Prescott's contract or the negotiations. When asked if the contract situation affects the draft, Stephen said the team's strategy at the position is unchanged. "The philosophy we have, as to Dak's contract, is to what it's always been. We like to develop a young quarterback. It's always great. We would like to have one to the develop to the level you could trade and build assets that way. Mike can speak to it; he wants a certain number of quarterbacks in the building ideally to be working with. Mike brings a really good background in developing quarterbacks."
 In his 13 years with the Packers, McCarthy's two starting quarterbacks were both Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers. Yet, that didn't stop Green Bay from drafting five quarterbacks in that span, including one in the second round. So with Prescott not having a contract, and Cooper Rush still rather unproven as the backup, it's likely the Cowboys could address the position in the draft.

MONTPELIER – The Vermont Department of Labor has announced that Vermonters who were not previously eligible for unemployment insurance benefits may now apply online for the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program. PUA eligible Vermonters include self-employed workers, independent contractors, and other individuals who are not eligible for traditional unemployment insurance.
 The Department of Labor and Agency of Digital Services have collaborated in the creation of the new PUA system making Vermont one of just a few states to stand up a complete PUA program.
 “We are pleased to provide this brand-new system for those who have not been able to receive traditional unemployment,” said Interim Commissioner Michael Harrington. “We know many Vermonters are still struggling, so getting this system up and running for this population is a big step forward in getting benefits into the hands of those impacted by this public health crisis.”
 If approved for PUA, claimants must continue to file weekly claims for each week they are unemployed and wish to receive benefits. Failure to do so will result in delayed payment. Eligible PUA claimants will be able to file and receive past benefits, dating back to the week of March 15, 2020.
 Weekly benefit amounts will be determined by 2019 earnings. Individuals that are eligible for PUA are also eligible for the additional $600 weekly benefit through the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation Program, which provides the additional benefit through July 25, 2020.
 Claimants can easily choose their preferred payment method (direct deposit or check), choose to have taxes withheld, or make other profile changes by using the online PUA Dashboard.
 More information on the PUA application process and eligibility can be found at labor.vermont.gov/pua. For additional information and updates on the Vermont Department of Labor, please visit labor.vermont.gov.

Many banks and mortgage companies have offered to give many Americans more time to pay their bills, but it's unclear what will happen once this grace period ends.
 "There's a difference between a grace period and outright abatement," said Winnette Ambrose, owner of Souk Bakery and The Sweet Lobby in Washington, D.C. "It's not like we will all make double when we go back out."
 Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG, expects job losses of "at least 25 million" this spring, a sky-high level not seen since the Depression era. The equally frightening number that's received too little attention is that the median forecast for the unemployment rate by the end of the year is 10% — meaning more than 15 million Americans would still be out of work in December.
 As people lose jobs, they stop paying their rent or mortgage, which can lead to eviction and a bad credit rating that drags them down for years. They lose health insurance and possibly their car. Often, they lose hope. This is the scenario the nation needs to avoid, and policymakers could be doing a much better job trying to prevent this, economists say.
 Even among people who still have jobs, 25% are fearful they will be laid off or furloughed in the coming year, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday. Pay cuts also are becoming common, with over 14% of people still employed getting lower pay or fewer hours in March, according to Gusto, a payroll processing company. All of this puts consumers on edge, making them hesitant to spend — even beyond fears about the coronavirus.
 "The full restoration of consumer confidence will be more difficult and will take longer to complete than following any other recession since the Great Depression," wrote Richard Curtin, head of the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers.

Tallapoosa County residents endured scattered damage to homes, cars and property Sunday after straight-line winds tore through the area. The devastation ranged in severity but insurance agents have been working nonstop to file claims and take care of clients as quickly as possible.
 “We have been insanely busy and we’re just blessed it wasn’t any worse,” said State Farm agent Karen Channell. “Personally I have dealt with more than 250 clients and seen severity across the gamut from trees in the middle of houses to blown off shingles.”
 Country Financial agent Lisa McClendon said she’s been in business for more than 30 years and said this is some of the worst damage and number of claims she’s seen from one incident.
 “For me, I think this is worse than the damage from Hurricane Opal in 2005,” McClendon said.
 Channell advises anyone with damage to contact their insurance agents and let them be those facilitators to advocate for assessments and repairs on their behalf.
 “At the end of the day, insurance companies will prove their value by delivering on service,” Channell said. “There are thousands affected but please be patient because your agent will fight for you and go to bat for you.”
 McClendon also encourages clients to be understanding of the situation and realize many people are completely displaced from their homes due to larger losses.
 “Some people are wondering if they’ll hear from someone (to assess damage), but if you can live in your home and it’s not leaking, please be patient,” McClendon said. “As of (Monday), I have more than 200 claims and we’ve called in a team of adjusters from all across different states.”
 Damage adversely affected so many families that local hotels and motels booked up quickly.
 “If people waited to book a room, they may have to search up the road (to Sylacauga) or go to Auburn,” McClendon said.
 With more weather potentially rolling in this week, McClendon advises residents to mitigate what damage they do have while they can.
 “Do what you can to protect your property,” she said.
 Channell offers some advice to homeowners for future similar situations.
 “They need to keep a good inventory of any damaged personal items,” Channell said. “Take lots of photos; you can never have too many photos of damage. Save all your receipts. Prepare for the power to go out. If you have a generator, that’s great; but if not, ice down the food you can save.”
 Channell reminds clients food loss is typically covered in insurance claims along with tarps and labor to install them.
 “Keep water out of the house and make sure you clean it up to not receive further damage,” Channell said.
 Assessments are being done on a severity scale and in the order claims were filed, according to McClendon.
 “When you have mass damage, the claims are processed from larger losses first and people displaced from their homes,” she said. “We have a large volume of claims.”
 When choosing contractors and companies to do the work needed after an incident like this, Channell said it’s important to choose local.
 “We try to use local every time we can,” Channell said. “The homeowners have the option to choose their own contractors but we have a list at our office of all local vendors.”
 She said this same process applies when choosing an insurance company.
 “You need a local agent because they know the contractors and vendors to help get you back to 100%,” Channell said. “The purpose of a policy is to deliver on the promise that we sold in exchange for a premium.”
 While many around the county are struggling, both Channell and McClendon want to remind clients to be aware of that number and courteous to those who may be worse off.
 “It’s important to realize this too shall pass,” Channell said.

If you're groping to understand the disorganization and ineptitude of America's response to coronavirus, you might find it helpful to know there's a single word that captures the situation perfectly.
   
 That word is: normal.
   
 The sad truth is that we've faced many crises in our history, and we almost always make a hash of them. We start with inertia, bestir ourselves to hubris, move on to bungling, and spice everything with venality. Situated far from the world's troubles, we are invariably drugged by complacency and handicapped by federalism, the system that gives us so many levels of government to get in each other's way.
   
 Unpreparedness is a signal feature of almost every American crisis, from the Revolutionary War right up to our recent stunning lack of ventilators and masks.
   
 In the Civil War, a crisis if there ever was one, the Union cause was imperiled by timid generals, bad equipment, scarce supplies and rampant fraud. When World War II broke out in Europe in 1939, the United States had the world's 18th-largest army, behind even that of Portugal. In one notorious set of military training exercises, many U.S. soldiers were armed with broomsticks, yet 12 managed to get themselves killed and 200 injured despite the absence of any real enemy. The attack on Pearl Harbor, in 1941, came as a surprise.
   
 The picture is just as bleak in civilian crises. John M. Barry, whose books include "The Great Influenza" about the 1918 pandemic, states flatly that, "In the United States, national and local government and public health authorities badly mishandled the epidemic."
   
 A decade later Uncle Sam met the Great Depression with bewilderment and battled it for years with earnest ineffectuality. FDR tried lots of things, but overall fiscal policy oscillated perversely and may have done little to shorten the nation's ordeal.
   
 The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, aside from a fleeting sense of unity, produced costly and inconclusive wars.
   
 The good news is that, in our biggest crises, things usually come out right at the end, though not without a lot of unnecessary suffering and waste. With luck and leadership, we usually manage to mobilize our vast national resources and creativity to vanquish whatever has beset us.
   
 Great crises, however mishandled initially, have also been the occasion for overdue changes. The Depression gave us Social Security, modern securities regulation and a wised-up Fed. The Second World War resulted in the Marshall Plan and helped propel us down the road to equality for black people, women and others.
   
 Our latest crisis may finally force us to universalize health care and find a way to rein in its costs. We might also agree that there are good reasons not to move so much manufacturing overseas.
   
 As Warren Buffett likes to say, it is never a good idea to bet against America.

The White House this week also identified Oklahoma as one of four states with the lowest testing capacity.
 Oregon, Montana and Maine also are able to test fewer than 30 in 1,000 people a month, The Associated Press reported.
 Dr. Kayse Shrum, the state’s secretary of science and innovation, said she is aware of the report.
 “We are clarifying the data that was sent and the way it was interpreted through the White House to clarify those numbers,” Shrum said.
 If hospital and incident rates “remain manageable” for 14 more days following the implementation of Phase 1, Stitt plans to move to Phase 2.
 Phase 2 allows nonessential travel to resume, along with organized sports activities. Funerals and weddings can be held with more than 10 people. Children and nursery areas in places of worship can reopen. Bars can open as long as there is diminished standing room occupancy.
 Fourteen days later, Stitt said Phase 3 would begin, but more guidance on that will be provided at a later date.
 But not all Oklahoma mayors were committed to automatically reopening by May 1.
 Stillwater Mayor Will Joyce said he appreciates that Stitt intends to rely on data to formulate a phased-in approach, but he said they don’t have access to that information for their local area.
 City leaders continue to work with local health officials to evaluate whether current local conditions meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, national and state guidance.
 “That being the case, the emergency declaration in place in Stillwater will remain effective through at least April 30,” he said. “The businesses identified by the governor as opening this week will remain closed in Stillwater for the time being.”
 He said there are meetings scheduled to talk with local businesses and other groups to determine the appropriate steps for their community.
 “COVID-19 continues to be a serious public health crisis in our city and our state,” he said. “It is imperative that we all take all possible precautions to keep it from spreading. Please stay home and keep our community safe.”
 Jonathan Small, president of Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, praised the decision to “begin gradually and safely reopening Oklahoma now that the state’s COVID-19 curve has flattened.”
 Since the beginning, Small said the conservative-leaning think tank has pressed for protecting Oklahomans from the virus while ensuring they can continue to provide for their families.
 It is important to continue safety measures to reduce the viral spread, but the state should lessen oppressive regulations to empower Oklahomans while mitigating risks, he said.
 “For tens of thousands of Oklahomans, their lives, health and livelihoods have already been negatively impacted by these shutdowns. By taking this first step to begin reopening Oklahoma, Gov. Stitt has helped limit these negative impacts and ensured that Oklahoma has a brighter future,” Small said.

“Each one of those deaths is probably the tip of an iceberg of unknown size,” Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County’s medical officer, said in an interview.
 Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Wednesday that there could be “subsequent announcements” as investigations across the state further examine the early origins of the virus. He said investigators are looking at coroner and autopsy reports going back to December in some counties.
 The earliest case discovered this week, friends and family members said, was of a woman who worked at a Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturing company with offices worldwide, including in Wuhan, China, the city where the outbreak began.
 A longtime friend said that on Feb. 2, the woman had complained of flulike symptoms. Four days later, he said, she was working from home, still feeling under the weather. Her daughter came home and found her collapsed at the breakfast bar in her kitchen, according to the friend, who asked not to be identified because he did not want the woman’s identity to be disclosed.
 Family members said they initially had wondered if she had been suffering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Her work as a company auditor for her firm, they said, brought her into contact with employees from all over the world and involved frequent travel.
 Across the country, doctors and public health officials have reported earlier cases of serious illnesses and deaths that preceded official diagnoses of the coronavirus. Only now are some of them being examined, and the new findings in Santa Clara County — suggesting that these suspicious earlier cases were instances of community transmission — shed light on the understated public health response to the widening outbreak.
