Two prisoners at Terre Haute who are not on death row are currently suing the government to halt the upcoming executions, arguing that holding such events is putting them and all the other incarcerated people in the complex at risk of serious illness or death. Lisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row, who is scheduled to be executed on Jan. 12, has not yet been transferred to Terre Haute. She is currently incarcerated at a women’s medical prison in Texas. Two of her attorneys contracted the virus after visiting her behind bars.

 # Task force: No tax increase needed to build $54.2M Upper Arlington community center
 Nate Ellis
 ThisWeek group
 A city-appointed task force says a 95,300-square-foot community center at an estimated constructed cost of $54.2 million is feasible without raising taxes.
 Barring a departure from the recommendation to build, Upper Arlington City Council is expected to move in January to ask voters on the May 4 ballot if they support a community center project on the 6.23-acre former Macy’s site at Kingsdale Shopping Center.
 “There will be a series of pieces of legislation that move us toward putting something on the ballot in May and authorizing us to issue the debt in order to move the project forward,” City Manager Steve Schoeny said.
 In the meantime, Schoeny said, city officials will begin processes that would enable them to contract with architects and construction professionals “very soon after” the election, should voters approve the project.
 “We are not going to enter into those contracts for design and construction prior to the voters giving their approval,” he said.
 The 16-member Upper Arlington Community Center Feasibility Task Force, consisting of residents appointed by City Council, culminated 18 months of work Dec. 16 with recommendations to council.
 In concluding that a seven-story community center can be built, the task force said it should be incorporated into Continental Real Estate Cos.’ proposal to redevelop the Macy’s property at Kingsdale Shopping Center.
 Continental CEO Frank Kass has committed to leaving a placeholder for a community center to be part of the project that preliminary proposals show would yield three buildings at heights of five, seven and nine stories.
 In addition to the community center, the project calls for 400 apartments and 124 to 139 senior-housing units among the three buildings, as well as a ground-floor restaurant, 50,000 square feet of office space and a two-story parking garage.
 Because City Council has pledged to enter into a tax-increment financing agreement for the project, it’s expected Continental would pay up to $17.25 million to a TIF fund rather than in property taxes to Upper Arlington Schools over 30 years.
 Money from that fund would be used to build the parking garage for the development and for other public infrastructure improvements for the site.
 According to the task force recommendations, the city could pay off a $40 million bond to build a community center with about $1.6 million that would be generated annually from the TIF from the Macy’s redevelopment, as well as two previously established TIF funds.
 Additionally, Matt Rule, chairman of the task force’s finance subcommittee, said remaining debt could be serviced through the estimated $500,000 in annual hotel-motel bed taxes guests pay to stay at two hotels in Upper Arlington, along with $5.42 million that could be raised privately through naming rights and other donations and an estimated $450,000 in yearly income taxes expected to be generated from the redeveloped site.
 That would leave the city’s cash contribution about $8.8 million, which Rule said could be funded with a portion of its “rainy-day” fund.
 That fund consists of money the city holds in reserve that is not allocated for operating or other expenses unless approved by council.
 “City council has made it very clear that they would like to continue to hold on to year-over-year reserve funding in excess of 30% of their operating expenses,” Rule said. “This $8.8 million that you see dropped in here would allow the city to stay the course maintaining a 30% reserve.
 “We would use excess funds that are currently available in that account to fund the last $8.8 million of the capital stack (for construction).”
 Rule said the city likely could garner another $264,512 annually by leasing office space on the sixth and seventh floors of the community center. That money would be above what the task force estimated would be needed to service the construction debt.
 In recommending the project be done at Kingsdale, the task force estimated it would cost $28 million less than a plan they rejected to build a community center as part of redeveloping the Municipal Services Center at 3600 Tremont Road.
 Annual operating costs for the community center are estimated at $3 million, according Schoeny. The task force recommended those costs could be covered by annual memberships.
 It suggested “basic” memberships for Upper Arlington residents – for access during regular recreation times and priority registration for most programs and classes – would range from $192 annually for individual senior citizens to $259 for non-seniors. Couples would pay $442 a year and families of four would pay $672, with a $10 fee for additional children.
 The task force suggested “premier” memberships would provide members-only access during extended hours, 10 free guest passes annually, a free child- watch package for children ages 2 to 12 and the use of group-fitness classes. Those annual fees would be $249.60 for an individual senior, $336.70 for non- seniors, $574.60 for couples, $873.60 for a family of four with a $13 charge for each additional child.
 Senior citizens living in Upper Arlington would be able to purchase a “senior healthy lifestyle” membership for $98 a year that would give them access to the center during off-peak hours or a “senior social” membership for $48 annually that would give them access to the facility’s lounge area for social activities.
 Rule said 2% of each membership fee would go to a scholarship fund for those who can’t afford annual memberships. Council would set the criteria for scholarship eligibility.
 Programs and the layout of the center has not been determined.
 However, based on public input the task force collected, conceptual plans call for a swimming facility, three full-size basketball courts, an “adventure play” area, fitness facilities with weights and other exercise equipment, a running track, a child-watch and indoor play area and locker rooms and restrooms.
 Additionally, the center would have administrative offices and potentially professional offices on its sixth and seventh floors.
 The fifth floor, conceptually, would have a 250-seat multiuse room and a variety of spaces for seniors, including a lounge, billiards room, demonstration kitchen for cooking programs and an outdoor patio.
 If a community center is built, the city would demolish the Upper Arlington Senior Center at 1945 Ridgeview Road and transfer the land to Upper Arlington Schools as part of the TIF agreement the district approved for the Macy’s site redevelopment.
 As part of that deal, the city will pay the district $50,000 annually through Dec. 31, 2037, after a certificate of occupancy is issued for the senior- living portion of the proposed development.

Northern Ontario skip Krista McCarville says her team is declining an invitation to participate in the Canadian women's curling championship due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic.
 McCarville's team from Thunder Bay, Ont., which won last year's Northern Ontario playdown, was nominated to represent its region at the upcoming Scotties championship after the Northern Ontario Curling Association cancelled its 2020 provincial playdowns due to the pandemic.
 However, McCarville cited travel restrictions in her community and the impact returning home from the event in Calgary could have on her job and family as reasons not to go in a Twitter post Thursday.
 McCarville is a Grade 6 teacher and mother of two.
 She said the decision by her team "breaks our hearts."

It did similar with Verstappen back in 2015, parachuting him into a Toro Rosso seat from outside the junior program, such was his talent. Understandable of course, but it also meant junior drivers felt that Red Bull wasn’t necessarily the path to take through their careers, because people could jump the queue easily. That led to a gap in talent on the Red Bull conveyor belt and forced it to go back to the likes of Daniil Kvyat and even Albon, having originally dropped both.

It’s nearly impossible to think of another movie that presents drinking and drinking culture under so many different facets. Most films about drinking are about the perils and tragedy of alcoholism. They serve mainly as bottom-of- the-barrel cautionary tales, mainly because the impact of putting forth someone with a run-of-the-mill drinking problem is not as tantalizing as courting Oscars with a classic drunkard performance. On the other hand, movies about the inherent pleasures of drinking are few and far between — mainly, one assumes, because it’s seen as irresponsible to depict something potentially harmful and deadly as a good thing. (Besides, I struggle to think of any pro- drinking film whose ultimate message isn’t “well, actually, this sucks.”) What _Another Round_ does is present alcohol intake as a behaviour of variables, as something that can take many different forms based on a series of factors, which greatly diminishes the film’s potential preachiness and facile conclusions.

TORONTO (AP) -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday Canada will be getting 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in January and that Canadians will be soon be saying "good riddance to 2020."

The messenger RNA vaccine from Moderna is on the verge of being authorized for use in Canada and could be approved for use in the United States as early as today.
 Until now, it was believed the vaccine had to remain frozen to at least -20 C until shortly before use, but the company says it can now safely transport liquid doses as refrigerated at between 2 C and 8 C.
 A Moderna spokeswoman says this makes the logistics easier of getting the vaccine to remote locations.
 Moderna was already considered less risky to ship than a similar vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech, which must be kept frozen between -60 C and -80 C, and Canada is planning to send it to the territories, remote Indigenous communities and for use at long-term care homes.
 Health Canada's review team is still waiting for final data on Moderna's manufacturing process before making its decision but the company plans to start shipping the first doses within 48 hours of getting the green light.

Suisham was with the club in 2005 when it needed a long-snapper and relayed that information to agent Gil Scott, who also represents Ladouceur.
 "The life of an NFL specialist can be fragile," Suisham said. "Kickers, punters, and long-snappers are often easily replaced due to a bad kick or snap.
 "It's an unbelievable accomplishment and a true testament to his consistency as a player to play 251 games and 16 seasons all with the Dallas Cowboys. We started together as teammates in 2005 and I continue to cheer him on."
 Suisham played in 128 career NFL games — ninth-most among Canadians — with three teams, including Dallas twice. Veteran punter Jon Ryan of Regina spent the '19 season with the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders after playing in 191 career NFL contests (No. 4 among Canadians) with Green Bay and Seattle.
 "L.P. will go down in NFL history as one of the best long-snappers to ever do it," Suisham said. "He’s as close to automatic as they come."
 Considering all the moving parts involved in the successful execution of a field goal, Ladouceur said it's important he, the holder and kicker all be in sync.
 "There aren't many events in sports where you need three guys to be completely on the same page to get the job done within 1.3 seconds," he said. "And the outcome of that kick can have a huge impact on the outcome of each game so the cohesiveness of the group is very important.
 "So I've always made sure we'd go to dinner or for a beer together or tried to hang out after meetings, whatever it is just try to build a bit of a relationship. The foundation of the trio is important for the success of the team."
 So it's not surprising Ladouceur lists punter Chris Jones, in his 10th season with Dallas, as his favourite teammate.
 "Chris can tackle, kick and punt and throw the ball about as good as any quarterback," Ladouceur said. "He's a full-on athlete who happens to be a punter and he's pretty damn good.
 "He's very down to earth and I’m fortunate to have him as a teammate and friend."
 Ladouceur and his family call Aledo, Texas home. For the past three years, Ladouceur has taken his NFL career season by season, something he'll do again with his wife, Brooke, after the '20 campaign.
 If he returned next year, Ladouceur would break former tight end Jason Witten's club record for most games played (255).
 "This might be it, I might have another one, I might have two, I don't know," Ladouceur. "I don't want to go in there and feel like I'm lagging, I want to still be on top of what I do and I feel I'm still able to do that."
