NEW YORK (AP) — The manager stands behind the counter at Ballpark Sports Shop on River Avenue, pinstriped jerseys fully stocked on the racks around him. The inventory is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, but on this day, he'll be lucky to sell a few $20 hats. Around the corner on 161st Street, the owner of Yankee Tavern sits in his empty dining room. He's served as many as 2,000 people on game days in his 93-year-old establishment. On this night, he had 20 seated under a tent outside. Meanwhile, the lights inside Yankee Stadium shined brightly. The ballpark usually brings nearly 50,000 fans per night to the Bronx. This summer, it's become little more than an oversize television studio. “What’s going on is devastating,” Yankee Tavern owner Joe Bastone said. Baseball in the Bronx is usually big business for shops and restaurants outside the storied stadium, but with fans stuck at home due to the coronavirus pandemic, those establishments aren't sure they'll survive. Desperate for aid, some are even begging for assistance from the Yankees themselves. “It’s all going to vanish unless somebody helps out,” said Cary Goodman, executive director of the 161st Street Business Improvement District. Many souvenir shops and sports bars in the area haven't bothered to reopen since the coronavirus forced their closure in March, and those that have are hardly drawing any customers. Sam Abbadi, the store manager at Ballpark Sports Shop, leaned over the counter prior to a Mets-Yankees game last month and said he hadn't made a single sale all day. “To be honest with you, we are in trouble,” Abbadi said. “Everyone is. All the sports bars, the souvenir shops, the restaurants around here. All the businesses on 161st (Street), without the Yankees, are nothing.” . ..

 Computer Age Management Services (CAMS), a key stock market infrastructure company, will see the National Stock Exchange (NSE) completely exit as its shareholder. CAMS has announced an initial public offering and the NSE is offloading 37.5 per cent of its stake via offer for sale.
 According to market sources, CAMS has upsized the IPO size by 50 per cent to allow the NSE divest its holdings. Earlier, the mutual fund transfer agency was looking to offload 1.846 crore shares through the IPO.
 In total, the NSE holds nearly 45 per cent stake in CAMS and it will dilute the remaining shares, too, shortly.
 The NSE had bought stake in CAMS in 2014. But, SEBI said that the exchange failed in taking prior permission of the regulator and hence it was in violation of regulations of the Securities Contract Act. Before the NSE picked up its stake in CAMS, the BSE wanted to buy the company and had approached SEBI for permission. SEBI, then headed by CB Bhave, did not give a go-ahead citing conflict of interest issues. CAMS has data of market participants who may be trading on rival platforms.
 Warburg Pincus-backed Great Terrain Investment will be a key promoter of CAMS. An update on the IPO is likely to be announced on Wednesday, and the issue is likely to hit the market next Monday.
 CAMS was NSE’s associate company up to February 4, 2020, NSE said in its annual report 2020.
 CAMS’ draft prospectus filed with SEBI on January 9 suggested an offer for sale of 1.216 crore shares, which included an offer of up to 41.44 lakh shares by Great Terrain, up to 60.99 lakh by NSEIL, up to 9.44 lakh shares by Acsys, up to 4.87 lakh shares each by HDFC and HDB Trust.

“We came up with a concept to have a really small, live audience. We hold the performances in the Lowry Activity Center, which can seat 250 at tables, and we had a seated audience of 35, so we were at a small fraction. Those few ticket holders paid $125 for their tickets, and they knew they were funding the program. So we sold just enough tickets to kind of break even for the season, and that allowed us to broadcast. We had about 200 viewers, which is bigger than any live audience we’ve ever had.”
 During the broadcasts of the concerts, there is a virtual tip jar that is set up where anybody who is interested can donate money that will be divided between multiple groups. The money raised will go toward the Red Dirt Relief Fund, OSU’s Music Industry Department, O’Colly Excellence Fund and Stillwater Community Center Foundation.
 Beckstrom said this is a pilot program for the Community Center hosting live concerts during the pandemic, but said there are plans in the works for a similar format for concerts next year, possibly beginning in February.
 “We’re actually in the process for putting the program together for next year,” he said. “It’s going to be a similar format, with really small audiences, because that’s where we are with the pandemic. They will be free broadcasts for people to watch, and we’re going to work even harder to try to get more money out to folks who need it.
 “We’re really focused on keeping it local. Our strong bias is to get local groups, at a minimum they’re from Oklahoma, and it’s just to help these musicians and organizations that need the help.”
 The next concert for the Prairie Pandemic Relief! Concert Series will take place Thursday, as the concerts are scheduled for the third Thursday of each month. Rebecca Ungerman, a jazz musician from Tulsa, will perform next week. Watermelon Slim, a blues musician and former Stillwater resident will perform on Oct. 15, and the final show will consist of two acts, with Aaron Hale, of Pawnee, and Thomas Trapp and Kim Reynolds, a couple that lives in Stillwater. There are still tickets available for the live performances, and pricing and more ticket information can be found at sccfriends.com.

 The new service will add shows from BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, other Paramount Pictures and ViacomCBS brands, in addition to what CBS All Access already offers.
 CBS and Viacom joined forces last August, saying they could better compete as one in the increasingly competitive streaming environment.

Virtual events platform Airmeet has raised ₹88 crore ($12 million) in a Series A round led by new investors Sequoia Capital India and Redpoint Ventures. The round also saw participation from returning investors Accel India, Venture Highway and Global Founders Capital.
 Gokul Rajaram, Caviar Lead at DoorDash (an American on-demand prepared food delivery service), also participated in the round, the company said in a statement.
 Airmeet will use the funds to accelerate technology development, grow the team of 60 personnel across six countries to 100, and expand its customer base globally.
 “We would be utilising the funds for three key functions. The first being product and technology development, which will focus on improving our core technology and the product to make it more intuitive and modular,” said Lalit Mangal, co-founder, Airmeet.
 “The second would be towards accelerating growth and marketing with dedicated investments in marketing to grow in the US, Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America. The third area would be hiring — as a fully remote team, we aim to build a global, talented team of 100 people,” he added.
 The company, which has hosted more than 10,000 events on its platform as of July 2020, aims to host over 1,000 events per day in the next calendar year.
 “Covid-19 has accelerated a permanent behavioural shift across many industries. With digitisation of largely traditional spaces leapfrogging by years, the $800-billion global offline events space is up for grabs. There is massive potential for players who drive the industry’s transition towards online-events,” said Abhishek Mohan, Vice-President, Sequoia Capital India.

Speaking in a typically candid and open interview in the The Rugby Paper, Burns said: “I’m happy to be out of there because I did feel like I was unfairly treated at Bath.
 “I didn’t feel like I was given a fair crack and that is clear for everyone to see.
 “I don’t want to talk too badly of Bath because when I went there from Leicester in 2017 I was desperate to do well and lead them to a Premiership title, but there were times when they would change every position in the backline bar the fly-half and I was just stuck on the bench.
 “To have not started a Premiership game at number ten before Covif-19, especially with the way the attack wasn’t really firing, was pretty disappointing.
 “I played full-back a couple of times and played well, and when I did come on at fly-half I felt my tactical kicking game was up to scratch, so it was hard to take not playing.”
 “But when the club has got no interest in developing you as a player or giving you an opportunity, you’re better off out of it.
 “That’s how I feel and there’ll always be frustrations.”
 Burns says he doesn’t know the moment his Bath career when south, but accepts it could have been the infamous blown try against Toulouse in the Heineken Champions Cup back in 2018.
 Bath Rugby were down 22-20. Having hit the post from a 20m penalty in front of the sticks to put his side back in front, Burns had a chance at redemption a couple of minutes from time; a chance to become the match-winner.
 He made a break on the right and had a simple run in, in front of the Thatchers Terrace. All he had to do was put the ball down.
 Instead, the full-back slowed down, blew a kiss, pointed to the fans and beamed with excitement. It looked like showboating.

The best way to engage with your employees when they’re dealing with personal challenges is to be vulnerable. Show your human side and build true connections with employees. Moreover, leaders should never pass the buck and place blame on exogenous sources. In order to be a “great” leader you need to own your faults and retain an internal locus of control. If you do this, your employees will respect you more for it and will always look to you for guidance. This is where true inspiration is derived from.

 For months, the president has said that TikTok must be sold to an American owner -- or shut down. What Zhang has proposed instead is a partnership with Oracle that would allow ByteDance to retain ownership of the business, while the US software giant becomes its "trusted technology provider" to protect user data.
 Final details are in flux, but ByteDance's venture investors may also take equity stakes in the TikTok business. It's also possible the Chinese parent will try to keep full ownership of the unit, according to one person familiar with the discussions.
 China hawks quickly declared the offer dead on arrival. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, wrote a letter to the US Treasury Secretary saying that the administration should "promptly reject" the partnership and press the Chinese parent to work out a "more acceptable solution."
 Zhang's opening gambit may simply be aimed at buying himself more time as he tries to survive the clash of the world's two superpowers. He is starting from a tough stance to open negotiations and avoid an immediate TikTok shutdown. It's a lesson that could have been taken directly from Trump's memoir on his days in real estate.
 "The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it," the president wrote in his best-selling autobiography with Tony Schwartz. "That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you're dead."
 Zhang is offering a few things likely to resonate with Trump. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday ByteDance's proposal would create 20,000 jobs and bring to the US the headquarters for "TikTok Global," presumably the video app's entire international operation. Trump has made bringing jobs to the country a cornerstone of his campaign as he heads toward November's presidential election.
 Zhang has also aligned himself with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a fervent supporter of the president who appears to have his trust. That alliance may persuade Trump to accept a deal from Oracle he wouldn't from another company.
 "Oracle is a great company," Trump said in August. "I think its owner is a tremendous guy. He's a tremendous person. I think that Oracle would be certainly somebody that could handle it."
 It's not clear whether the Oracle deal includes a payment to the federal government -- a fee that Trump has insisted on for weeks. That demand has baffled policy experts, but it may improve ByteDance's odds of approval, if included.
 Trump has made TikTok the central example of his campaign to get tough on China. He signed an executive order that bans the app in the US on Sept. 20, and, in addition, ruled that ByteDance must sell the video app's US assets by mid-November under an order from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or CFIUS.
 Heading into the last weekend of August, Zhang had been leaning toward a proposal from Microsoft Corp., where he had briefly worked. The agreement called for a full buyout of TikTok US by the software giant and partner Walmart Inc.
 But the Chinese government intervened at the last minute with a new set of restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technologies, including those used in the app. Beijing insisted its regulators must also approve any asset sales by ByteDance.
 China's move was seen by several people involved in the talks as an effort to give Zhang more leverage. He couldn't give away too much to the Trump administration or Beijing wouldn't sign off.
 Instead, Zhang turned to Ellison and Oracle. Best known for its corporate software, the Redwood City, Calif.-based company has a growing cloud computing business that could be used to host videos and strong technical capabilities for securing user data. Ellison is also known for his fierce combativeness. When Hewlett Packard fired its CEO for an alleged inappropriate relationship, Ellison called it -- publicly -- "the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs."
 What Zhang and Ellison crafted is nothing like the deal that the Trump administration had anticipated. Instead of buying the business outright, Oracle would make an investment in a newly restructured TikTok, people familiar with the proposal said. At least two shareholders in TikTok's Chinese parent company, General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital, would take stakes in the new business, said one of the people, all of whom asked not to be identified because the terms aren't finalized.
 "Based on the information that we have at the moment about the Oracle deal, I can't say that I'm hugely reassured," Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Bloomberg Television. "ByteDance is essentially under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party."
 Yet Mnuchin made it sound like the proposal is worthy of serious consideration.
 "We need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans' data is secure, phones are secure, and we'll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical team," Mnuchin told CNBC during an interview early Monday.
 Even if TikTok's data is stored by Oracle in the US, ByteDance could keep some control over the app's algorithms, the computer code behind what the service uses to pick and choose which videos are shown to which users. If TikTok's algorithms remain in the hands of ByteDance, they run the risk of being manipulated by Beijing.
 "The CCP has enormous leverage over this company and that means it would be trivially easy for the CCP to force ByteDance to very subtly nudge up or promote content that would be preferential to one presidential candidate, for instance," said Ryan.
 Ultimately, Zhang circled back to proposing a transaction similar to what he originally offered to address American scrutiny. ByteDance had been willing to set up a global headquarters for TikTok with a separate board, although he always wanted keep his ownership.
 Perhaps in the end, the Chinese entrepreneur decided he could live with the dire consequences of a ban. Trump may be able to shutter TikTok in the US, but Zhang would maintain full ownership elsewhere -- and perhaps return to the country in the future if the political environment changes.
 It's a mindset Trump may be able to comprehend.
 "It's been said that I believe in the power of positive thinking. In fact, I believe in the power of negative thinking," the president wrote in his book. "If you plan for the worst-- if you can live with the worst-- the good will always take care of itself."

Marking a massive leap as COVID-19 testing picked up yet again, the capital district recorded its highest single-day spike as 656 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Tuesday. As many as 629 swab samples were collected, nearly thrice the 256 tests done on Monday.
 The number of active cases touched 5,503. The death toll in the district rose to 154 with five more deaths — of natives of Parassala (60 years old), Beemapally (64), Vilappilsala (89), Poovar (54), and a 67-year- old man whose native place is yet to be ascertained — being attributed to the disease.
 The emerging COVID-19 situation lend credence to the district administration’s projection of a sharp spike, partly attributed to the Onam rush. The recent spate of demonstrations in the State capital is also feared to have contributed to the increased caseload.
 ## Only four imported cases
 Local transmission remained unabated as it accounted for almost all cases except four imported ones from other States. The sources of infection in 97 cases were yet to be known. Twenty-three health workers are also among those affected. A total of 268 people recovered from the illness on the day.
 The Central Prison at Poojappura was declared COVID-19-free on Tuesday after 42 infected prisoners tested negative, a few days after several others recovered from the illness. As many as 485 people, including the inmates and jail officials, had been diagnosed with COVID-19 a month ago. With the prison regaining normalcy, the Kerala Prisons have restored all of its services, including the food manufacturing unit, cafeteria, men’s saloon, cloth store, petrol pump, and the organic vegetable stall.
 Five people, including four of a single family, tested positive at Pulimath, Kilimanoor. Cases continued to mount at Attingal where three people were diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday.
 The district administration has exhorted pregnant women to ensure strict room quarantine in light of the COVID-19 situation. District Medical Officer K.S.

Many factors contribute to food insecurity. Poverty is the biggest, and Oklahoma has a poverty problem. Our poverty rate is 15.8 percent; for children, it is a staggering 22.6 percent. Lack of health care, underfunded education, limited job opportunities, and unfair tax burdens are also factors.
 Many federal programs provide food, income, and healthcare assistance, but they don't do enough. So many people depend on food banks. Across Oklahoma, food banks serve tens of thousands. Here in Stillwater, about 1,200 people per month turn to Our Daily Bread for food assistance. ODB is a wonderful opportunity for you and other Stillwater neighbors to lend a hand. Learn more at OurDailyBreadStillwater.org.
 Let’s also consider what can be done at the state level.
 You, the voters of Oklahoma, took a big first step by approving Medicaid expansion. Starting next July, families with incomes up to 135 percent of the federal poverty level will get health care coverage. This means, when money is tight, they will no longer have to choose between doctor visits and dinner on the table.
 Also, the legislature is positioned to take action on your votes. In May, both chambers approved funding for Gov. Stitt’s alternative expansion plan. Although he then vetoed his plan, those measures are still available to fund true Medicaid expansion.

BALTIMORE (AP) — A Maryland religious institution has pledged to create a $1 million fund for programs benefiting the Black community in an effort to make reparations for its role in slavery and racial injustice. The Maryland diocese of the Episcopal Church voted Saturday in favor of establishing the fund, The Baltimore Sun reported. Historians for the diocese have found that a majority of its churches built before 1860 were constructed using slave labor or by those who benefited financially from slave labor, and that the establishment of some churches contributed to the racial segregation of neighborhoods. The diocese, which includes more than 44,000 congregants across the state, is 90% white, according to Bishop Eugene Taylor Sutton. “Why should we continue to benefit as an institution when so many in the Black community have never had the opportunity to have a good education, good jobs or good medical care?\" said Sutton, who is Black. \"We’ve benefited from racist institutions, and now we are going to invest financially.\" The $1 million makes up more than 20% of the diocese’s operating budget and existing funds in the diocese’s endowment will provide the capital, The Sun quoted the diocese as saying. Sutton said the million-dollar commitment “is going to hurt us, and it should.” The bishop has suggested the church funds go toward providing job training, establishing urgent care centers, improving housing- assistance programs and providing community college tuition for members of the Black community. He and church leaders said the effort aims to acknowledge and “repent” for the church's role in systemic racism.

Norfolk County has no immediate plans to close a second arena.
 The possibility of closing a second ice surface was contained in a budget resolution in January. This is the same resolution that closed the arena at the Simcoe Recreation Centre to make way for a new Simcoe Seniors Centre, a decision affirmed at the Aug. 18 meeting of council.
 The January resolution was approved in response to an acute cash crunch arising from years of deficit financing, giving rise to depleted reserve accounts. The goal of the resolution was to produce another $150,000 in annual savings from mothballing a second arena in Delhi or Langton.
 But on Sept. 8, CAO Jason Burgess said the need to close a second surface was off the table for the time being because staff has found the desired savings.
 "There is no requirement to do anything further in 2020," Burgess said, adding the question may arise again at the end of 2021 if Norfolk's financial situation deteriorates further.
 "Council is not bound by the budget motion at this point in time."
 Senior staff was called on to clarify the county's position in response to non-stop speculation on social media. So many stories and scenarios are circulating that many in Norfolk are desperate for a fact-check - including members of Norfolk council.
 "The problem is we have a lot of miscommunication in the public realm," said Simcoe Coun. Ian Rabbitts, chair of Norfolk's budget committee.
 "When you put arenas through a process of Russian roulette, we have to address that as community leaders. We're seeing it in our email boxes. Why don't we get this on the council table?"
 Some council members were surprised to hear that public meetings regarding this issue are also in the works. They will be scheduled once council receives a report in December on the public-private proposals it has received on the future management of Norfolk's arenas.
 This call-for-proposals was also included in the January budget resolution. The process hasn't been a smooth one, however, now that COVID-19 is standing in the way of the public gatherings required to respond effectively to council's game plan.
 As well, there have been complaints that uncertainty this year over the status of a proposed $50-million recreation complex in Simcoe - one with potential for a twin-pad arena - was complicating calculations for future use of arenas in neighbouring communities.
 That question was resolved in August with word that Norfolk's application for federal-provincial funding had been denied. Council's support of the hub proposal was contingent on receiving significant support from senior governments.
 Burgess reiterated staff's position that the objective of the request-for- proposals is to give council options in case it's confronted with another difficult budget session where costs are escalating and revenue is tight. He said neither council nor applicants with ideas for Norfolk's facilities are bound by this process, adding all can stand down at any time in the absence of binding agreements.

Then in the off-season the cold, hard business of the NBA hit him: Lin had the skills of a backup point guard in the league, a rotation player, but the NBA is deep with solid point guards and teams elected to use that spot on a younger player they could develop and hold on to longer. Lin, now 32, couldn't land a contract, so he opted to play the season in China (which, like the NBA, had a season disrupted by the coronavirus, but he returned there to finish the season).

But for sheer ability and for sheer natural talent, I think Krom Hendricks probably would have outshone even Sinclair.

TARANTO - Un 16enne della provincia di Taranto, che insieme ad altri due ragazzi si era seduto su una sbarra del passaggio a livello in localita Lido Azzurro, impedendone il ritorno alla posizione normale, e stato bloccato dalla Polizia Ferroviaria di Taranto e denunciato per danneggiamento alle infrastrutture ferroviarie e interruzione di pubblico servizio. I genitori del minore saranno tenuti a risarcire i danni. Gli agenti della Polfer sono intervenuti a seguito di segnalazioni riguardanti alcune anomalie e danneggiamenti in corrispondenza del passaggio a livello, che si trova lungo la tratta Metaponto-Taranto, e hanno notato tre ragazzi in moto che, dopo aver fatto un paio di giri nei paraggi, si sono fermati in prossimita del passaggio a livello chiuso in attesa del transito del treno Fracciarossa, proveniente da Roma e diretto a Taranto. I giovani, abbandonate le moto in mezzo alla strada, pochi secondi prima del passaggio del treno si sono messi a cavalcioni di una delle sbarre, dondolandosi pericolosamente. Gli agenti sono intervenuti riuscendo a bloccare uno dei tre ragazzi, ancora a penzoloni sulla sbarra che si stava rialzando, mentre gli altri due si sono allontanati in sella alle moto. Il passaggio a livello e rimasto bloccato, con una sbarra semiaperta e semaforo rosso, con conseguente interruzione della circolazione ferroviaria ed accumulo di ritardo per i treni in transito.

NEW BEDFORD -- There's a mystery afoot at the Fort Taber-Fort Rodman Military Museum and Bill Niedzwiedz, museum president, is hoping the public can help him solve it.
 The mystery surrounds four photos that were dropped off at the museum from an anonymous source.
 "Somebody brought them in and figured we'd like to have them since they are military," Niedzwiedz said. He was only told the pictures were found during a house clean out. He said the people dropped off the photos as the museum was closing and didn't give the address of the house where the photos were discovered.
 "We were closing -- literally shutting off the lights -- when the photos were dropped off," Niedzwiedz said.
 Niedzwiedz said since the photos were brought to the museum, it's likely the house where they were found is in New Bedford. However, he said the military museum is also very well known in Rhode Island, which broadens the area of where the photos possibly came from.
 "I hope we can find their relatives and return these photos to the family," Niedzwiedz said.
 One photo is a studio portrait of a Navy sailor, most likely from World War II. His uniform indicates he was a machinist mate. Niedzwiedz said he cannot tell what the ribbon on his uniform represents because it is old, and the colors might not be accurate because the portrait was colorized.
 The stamp on the back of the photo denotes that it was taken in a photo studio on the 6th floor of the Callender, McAuslan & Troup building in Providence. The building is located on Westminster Street and was built in 1866. It's housed many businesses over the years, including Lupo's Heartbreak Hotel, a Providence rock music institution in the 1980s, according to the Providence Preservation Society.
 The second photo is of a young man, dressed in a suit and tie.
 Both photos are inside a folding, gold-tone frame, so it's possible that both men are related.
 There is another photo of 11 sailors and two Navy officers standing in front of four old Naval Air Station vehicles.
 The fourth photo is taken at the same Naval Air Station with sailors crouching in the front row, and others standing behind them, flanked by three Naval officers.
 Niedzwiedz posted the photos on social media hoping someone might recognize the men and the location of the Naval Air Station in the other photos.
 He hasn't received any responses yet.
 The Standard-Times has also reached out to the archives department at Providence City Hall, and is hoping for a response to an inquiry about the old photo studio that was located inside the Callender, McAuslan & Troup building.
 Niedzwiedz said this isn't the first time someone has donated items to the museum without any attribution of where the items came from.
 "We have a bust of Father DeValles. It was just sitting at the front door one morning. Someone had just dropped it off," he said.
 He recalled one time when a woman found out a picture of her great uncle, John Santos, was hanging in the museum.
 "She flew all the way from Hawaii just to take a picture of the picture for a family reunion," Niedzwiedz said. It was the only picture she had of him. He said he offered to give her the original, but she wanted that one to stay at the museum.
 Niedzwiedz said the mystery photos might be the last remaining photos of the men in the family.
 Anyone who recognizes the men in the photos or the location of the Naval Air Station can contact the Fort Taber Fort Rodman Military Museum at 508-994-3938.

"More folks are probably 'on board' to the ideas, but implementation is hard."

Prakash Thosre grew up in the jungle. His father was in the Indian Forest Service, retiring in 1976, the same year Prakash cleared the UPSC exam. His first posting was in the Melghat Tiger Reserve, Amravati, Maharashtra. “I was longing to come to this area which I loved so much from my childhood,” he says, remembering the undulating terrain, with a new scene opening each time the _kuchha_ road took a turn. “I don’t think I would have wanted to explore any other tiger reserve,” he says, remembering the varied flora and fauna and the peaceful people across the seven years he’d spent there in different tenures.
 In his initial years in service, Prakash took tales of the trees and beasts of nature to school children and senior citizens, through his talks. He’d also write short stories — about 50 of them — on wildlife in English and Marathi newspapers, but it is only after he retired in 2012 as Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Maharashtra, that he has had the time to pen a book. “Numerous nature-lovers enjoyed these articles and requested that the stories be compiled in the form of a book,” he says.
 Prakash speaks on his work in Melghat, and on his book, _The Melghat Trail_ : _Walking the Wilds with a Forester._ Rich with anecdotes that took him two years to write, the 262-page book, with 41 chapters takes us on a roller- coaster ride of the jungle, through rare encounters with wild animals. In his foreword, Supreme Court Chief Justice SA Bobde calls it “The Jungle Book of recent times.”

 Truthfully, the nature of the job – the wise regulating and rate-setting of utility monopolies – has almost nothing to do with a commissioner’s political party. But there are three basic qualities a voter should look for when selecting the person to represent them – and the greater public good – on the PSC:

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The saxophone guy, the one that plays theme songs from 1970s TV shows for loose change as fans squeeze past on the Roberto Clemente Bridge on their way to and from PNC Park, is gone. The line to take selfies next to Willie Stargell's statue outside the left field entrance to the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates is, too.
 Other than the lights and the occasional — very occasional — fireworks display following a Pirates victory, the streets around one of major league baseball's crown jewels are desolate.
 This isn't what Mike Sukitch envisioned when he returned to the North Side neighborhood he grew up in following three-plus decades in the corporate world.
 As retirement loomed, Sukitch felt an urge to get back to his family's roots. Three previous generations of Sukitches worked in the bar/restaurant business, one of the reasons he opened Mike's Beer Tavern on Federal Street - typically the heart of pre and postgame activities at the park — in 2018.
 The success of the watering hole where patrons can choose from 500 beers led Sukitch to purchase the spot next door in January and christen it the North Shore Tavern. It seemed like a good idea at the time. He bought low and devised a plan that would allow him to turn a modest profit regardless of interest in the home team. The math made sense.
 “Whether the Pirates draw 4,000 or 40,000," Sukitch said, “I just need 150 in my place and I’m doing well.”

The body of a man who went missing at Sauble Beach on Sunday has been located.
 West Region OPP said in a tweet at about 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday that the body of the missing swimmer had been located.
 "The body was observed in the water at the beginning of the day," the tweet said. "The name is not being released at this time to allow for the notification of next of kin."
 In a news release police said the body was located shortly after the Grey Bruce OPP Marine Unit and OPP Underwater Search and Recovery Unit started searching on Tuesday.
 Police were dispatched just after 4 p.m. on Sunday to the area of Second Avenue South, north of French Bay Road on the Saugeen First Nation end of Sauble Beach. The swimmer was last observed out from shore in distress and struggling in the waves, police said Monday morning.
 On Sunday, the OPP were assisted on scene by firefighters from the South Bruce Peninsula, Saugeen First Nation and Saugeen Shores fire departments. Also assisting in the search was the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre run by the Royal Canadian Air Force and Canadian Coast Guard.
 An OPP helicopter and two OPP vessels were involved in the search, which was put on hold at the end of the day Sunday evening.
 On Monday, the OPP Aviation Services, OPP Underwater Search and Recovery Unit and Grey Bruce OPP Marine Unit were involved in the search.
 The latest incident comes just over a week after a Toronto man was pulled from the water at Sauble Beach with vital signs absent on Sept. 5. Troy Cupid, 20, was later pronounced dead at hospital.

 Goodman, who has led the 161st Street BID since 2009, thinks the Yankees owe it to their neighbors to step in and help.
 They've done it before. When Nike became Major League Baseball's official uniform supplier last offseason, souvenir shops outside Yankee Stadium feared they'd be unable to acquire merchandise to sell as part of the new deal. Goodman shared the concern with the Yankees, and the team stepped in to ensure the shops would continue to have access to official MLB jerseys.
 “We were ecstatic, but it turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory,” Goodman said. “They ordered hundreds of thousands of dollars in merchandise, and they’re stuck with it."
 After efforts to procure city-based emergency grants for the shops and bars mostly failed, Goodman said he has reached out twice to the Yankees, hoping to get aid to help the souvenir shops and bars nearby.
 The ballclub has been active in local coronavirus relief efforts. It has worked with the Bronx Chamber of Commerce to provide relief for small businesses, contributing $75,000 toward emergency relief grants, helping organize pro bono legal aid and launching a virtual town hall to educate local business owners on how best to navigate the pandemic.

Max India, which recently relisted in bourses after a demerger process, said on Tuesday it will go in for a capital reduction programme that would entail buy back of shares to the tune of ₹92 crore to reward its public shareholders.
 The company plans to offer its public (that is, non-sponsor group) shareholders the option of taking ₹85 per share for up to 20 per cent of their holding in lieu of cancelling these shares. Max India shares closed at ₹67.30 at the NSE on Tuesday. Post the demerger process, Max India has a treasury corpus of over ₹400 crore created primarily from the divestment proceeds of its erstwhile subsidiary, Max Bupa. It intends to utilise up to ₹92 crore from this corpus for the capital reduction process, while the balance of ₹300-plus crore will be apportioned for growth and other operational expenses. The board of Max India approved the capital reduction exercise on Tuesday. Post the capital reduction, Max India’s outstanding shares will decrease by up to 20 per cent from 5.38 crore shares to 4.3 crore. Mohit Talwar, Vice-Chairman, Max Group and MD, Max India said, “We had expressed our intent to reward our shareholders at the time we divested our health insurance business Max Bupa. This capital reduction process is a move towards that intent even though capital conservation has become important after the onset of Covid-19 induced economic slowdown. We will still have sufficient growth capital for growth and other expenses.”
 ## Sponsor group holding
 Meanwhile, the Max India sponsor group has communicated its intention of not tendering its shares for capital reduction. Consequently, its shareholding is likely to increase to 51 per cent from the current 41 per cent. It will seek a SEBI exemption from the open offer requirement, accordingly. The final quantum of the capital reduction will be based on SEBI’s decision on exemption.
 Max India is the holding company of Max Group’s residences for seniors and senior care business, collectively known as ‘Antara’. It also owns a skilling company, ‘Max SkillFirst’.

Gates said: “So, even if there is a challenge over the next two years due to the pandemic, countries like Nigeria must put health services back in shape particularly in the North where over 10 per cent or in some cases 15 per cent of children die before they clock five years. “This really shouldn’t be the case if investment in primary healthcare is modest enough. This should not be like funding for hospitals where the funding is small and the impact is very high. If we renew commitment to primary healthcare the right way, we will be able to see dramatic improvements, particularly in Nigeria, even if we fall short of the specific SDG goal.”

The Mandalorian season 2 trailer is here and, yes, your week just got roughly 2000x better because of it.
 Featuring the next step in Mando and Baby Yoda’s journey, the first official teaser for the Star Wars Disney Plus series is unmissable. As an added bonus, it takes us further and deeper into the hive of scum and villainy in a galaxy far, far away.
 Immediately following on from The Mandalorian’s first season, we see Mando’s ship heading towards an unknown planet. The Armorer tells Mando that he must "reunite" The Child with its own kind. Ignoring the fact that there might be more (???) of The Child’s species kicking about, it sets up the show’s sophomore season - consisting of eight episodes - nicely.
 Then, we get the show’s first explicit Jedi reference. Mandalore The Great once fought these so-called sorcerers. Watching over Mando is a mystery figure - a Jedi? Ahsoka? It’s hard to tell - and then The Mandalorian season 2 trailer spirals off into an epic galaxy-spanning odyssey that ventures everywhere from the harsh tundra climes of an icy planet to what looks like Star Wars’ take on wrestling.
 In one final kicker, we get to see Baby Yoda kicking some off-screen ass. He once again uses his Force powers to hack a device, closes his pod, then the sound of blaster fire fills the room after Mando gets surrounded by goons. Baby got payback, that’s for sure.
 The Mandalorian season 2 drops on Disney Plus on October 30. If you need more from The Mandalorian season 2 then this is The Way: here are the first official images, plus a look at the impact Star Wars creator George Lucas had while on-set. And if you're looking for a Star Wars rewatch, then here's how to watch the Star Wars movies in order.

“Igual que el año pasado, veinte vivas, nomás que hay unos nuevos. Invito a todos a gritar, invito a todos a que festejemos nuestra independencia nacional.
