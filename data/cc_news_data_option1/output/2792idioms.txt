 These represent our history. We may not like it and be ashamed of it, but it is our history. Taking down statues, taking Aunt Jemima off the pancake box or rewriting Gone with the Wind will not change the hearts and minds of people.
   
 Those are cosmetic changes. Real change needs to come in the attitudes of everyone.

Do not just start writing essays without suitable planning. Essay writing is very demanding, and you are most likely going to wear yourself out before you can finish your paper. Right from topic selection, ensure that you plan on how you are going to get the paper done. Choose the right thesis statement, conduct your research, write your introduction, think of the way that you are going to transition between ideas and so on from the very start. In fact, draw up a plan and divide up the writing process into timed steps. This will make the writing process simpler, and you will know what to do at each step of the way. When you fail to plan, you are planning to fail. When you don't have a good and guiding plan in place, you are likely to skip some important stages in the process which may work to your disadvantage in the long run.

 The Algerian-born defender was then handed his first senior start in the 2-2 draw at Shrewsbury Town in the following round.
 Larouci was regarded as one of several leading young prospects playing in France when Liverpool won the race for his signature, with Manchester United reportedly having also been interested.
 He began his time at the Academy as a winger but switched to left-back at the start of the 2018-19 season for the under-18s and was part of the side that won the FA Youth Cup that season.

 Former Ghana midfielder Derek Boateng says leaving Sweden to Israel after the 2006 World Cup cost him his place in the Black Stars team.
 Boateng left AIK to join Beitar Jerusalem after an impressive World Cup with the Black Stars in Germany.      “After the World Cup, I was expecting that the players who represented the country have to report back to the team but it didn’t happen," he told Joy FM.      "I think we destroy our tournament squad a little too early and we need to try and maintain the same squad for some time so there will be cohesion in the squad," he continued.
