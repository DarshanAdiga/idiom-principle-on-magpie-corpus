The 5.5 percent national home price increase in July compared to the same month in 2019 represents a 1.2 percent leap from June and the fastest price growth rate in almost two years. The CoreLogic report attributes the phenomenon to plummeting interest rates, which slid below 3 percent for the first time ever in July, and what the document describes as "further constriction of for-sale inventory."
 Simply put, the dearth of homes for sale, exacerbated by the decisions of potential sellers to sit tight and stay put amid the COVID-19 crisis, means demand is outstripping supply -- and that's pushed prices into the stratosphere in Denver.

The Cardinals greet the third of their six doubleheaders in a fortnight in much the same way they've greeted all the rest.


  If anything, they've become familiar with revamping the roster on the fly.


  The Cardinals placed righthander Johan Oviedo, their rookie who has helped them complete the rotation during this challenging stretch, on the injured list because he had contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.


  The Cardinals have removed Oviedo from the team and had him tested regularly. He has not tested positive and he has no symptoms.


  The Cardinals are hopeful he can start Monday. That would open up Sunday's start for Carlos Martinez.

In the trailer breakdown, I mentioned the Greek-inspired tablet Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) is examining while on Caladan, along with how it connects to House Atreides’ claims to be descended from King Agamemnon (touched on in _Dune Messiah_ and further explored in other sequels, albeit with mixed results). But there’s a lot more to it. The tragedy of Agamemnon is a direct parallel to the events of _Dune_ and points to the saga’s ongoing theme of history repeating itself.


  Agamemnon led the Greek forces in the Trojan War, tasked with the return of his brother’s wife, Helen of Troy, after she was kidnapped by Paris. The Greeks ultimately succeeded in sacking Troy, in spite of the odds, but Agamemnon was ignorant of the real threats waiting for him. Upon returning home, Agamemnon and his entourage were killed in a grand betrayal — orchestrated by his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover Aegisthus.


  This foreshadows the same betrayal that takes place in _Dune_ , as well as the misinformation that surrounds it for years. Baron Harkonnen kills Duke Leto and destroys House Atreides in their own home, thanks to a traitor in their midst. Then, he manages to convince some of the only survivors that Leto’s concubine, Lady Jessica, was the one who made it happen. It just shows how good Villeneuve is at _symbolism_.

MANILA, PHILIPPINES (10 September 2020) — The Asian Development Bank (ADB) today launched the latest edition of its annual statistical report for the region, Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2020, and an update to its online database, Key Indicators Database.


  Key Indicators 2020 presents a comprehensive set of economic, financial, social, and environmental indicators, including for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), for ADB’s 49 regional members covering the years from 2000 to 2019. A key statistic in the report highlights how the region has become the biggest contributor to global gross domestic product (GDP), reaching a 34.9% share in 2019 from 26.3% in 2000.ADB


  “The Asia and Pacific region has made tremendous development progress over the last two decades, becoming the biggest contributor to global GDP while lifting millions of people out of poverty,” said ADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada. “Timely and accurate data enable us to take stock of this progress and areas that require further improvement. Wide access to data, especially amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, will continue to contribute to the region’s progress on the path to more inclusive and sustainable development.”


  Key Indicators 2020 highlights the expanding influence of Asia and the Pacific in global investment and trade. The region’s economies received more than one-third of total global direct investment in 2019, while the region’s global export share increased to 36.5% in 2019 from 28.4% in 2000. More than half of the reporting economies in the region recorded a GDP growth rate of 4% or higher in 2019. These gains are threatened, however, by the COVID-19 pandemic, with unemployment rising and income falling as lockdowns cause steep reductions in business operations and people’s activities in general.


  The report includes a special supplement looking at how the granularity of poverty estimates can be enhanced by integrating household surveys and censuses with data extracted from satellite imagery. The report identifies practical considerations and technical requirements for this novel approach to mapping the spatial distribution of poverty, while outlining the investments required by national statistics offices to fully capitalize on the benefits of incorporating innovative data sources into conventional work programs.


  Key Indicators 2020 also presents:


  Updates on SDG indicators in Asia and the Pacific;


  Regional trends and tables, including indicators across eight themes—people; economy and output; money, finance, and prices; globalization; transport and communications; energy and electricity; environment; and government and governance;


  New analysis on trends in changes in developing Asia’s global competitiveness in supplying various products, and updated data on global value chains; and


  Updated individual country tables for the 49 regional members of ADB.


  The Key Indicators Database, first launched in September 2019, offers access to more than 1,100 statistical indicators from the year 2000 onwards in a user-friendly and accessible interface.

To suggest anything other than the total annihilation of the enemy -- and the enemy includes all who do not fully and uncritically support the cause -- is apostasy. It is the dead who rule.

An independent economic analysis accompanying the THRIVE Agenda estimates that implementing it would require an annual public investment of about $US950 ($1,306) billion, sustained over the next critical decade. But that’s nothing compared to the costs of climate inaction.
 “At less than $US1 ($1) trillion per year, the THRIVE Agenda is a bargain,” said Beachy. “What’s expensive is the climate crisis, mass unemployment, threats to our health, and racial injustice. We cannot afford to sit idly and let the costs stack up from the mounting economic, health, racial, and environmental crises.”
 If passed, the resolution wouldn’t immediately solve everything. Though it does include proposals to support transitioning the electricity grid, agriculture, and transportation away from emitting carbon, it does not include plans to end the country’s fossil fuel supply. Mitch Jones, policy director of Food and Water Action, said he applauded many aspects of the plan, but that this is an important failing.
 “Any plan meant to address the spiraling, out of control climate chaos we are witnessing around the world must have a plan to stop the extraction, processing, and burning of fossil fuels at its centre,” he said in an email. “There must be a ban on fracking, a ban on new fossil fuel infrastructure, a ban on crude oil and natural gas exports. The THRIVE agenda does not do that.”
 Based on its price tag alone, the resolution is also currently highly unlikely to pass through the Republican-controlled Senate, or even to win support from some more moderate Congressional Democrats.
 But the resolution’s supporters say that backing the THRIVE agenda isn’t just a good idea to improve quality of life and slow climate change but also useful in securing support from voters in the critical upcoming election. New polling released alongside the resolution shows broad nationwide support for the THRIVE resolution’s central goals, including federal investments in improving infrastructure, eliminating carbon pollution from the electricity grid by 2035, and giving all workers rights to form unions. That includes majority support in critical battleground House districts and the swing states of Ohio, Texas, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina, Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, and Minnesota. If political officials get on board with the plan, it might serve them well with the voters their courting.
 “At a time when it’s almost impossible to feel good about anything in this country, which is literally burning the sky before our very eyes, the THRIVE agenda offers a vision that would work — and that we might even win,” said Aldana Cohen. “It couldn’t come at a better time.”

A Kenosha, a distanza di pochi giorni, si sono recati in visita sia Trump che Biden. Il primo ha rifiutato l’incontro con la famiglia di Blake e ha puntato sullo slogan “Law and order” promettendo il ripristino della legalità e pungo duro nei confronti di “saccheggiatori e violenti”, il secondo ha consegnato un messaggio di “unità nazionale” in risposta alla crisi. L’impressione è che le violenze degli ultimi giorni abbiano dato a Trump la possibilità di tentare, a meno di due mesi dal voto del 3 novembre, un ultimo affondo in un territorio che resta decisivo per l’esito finale della corsa alla presidenza. Proprio sul Wisconsin si concentrano le attenzioni di Trump, che secondo un sondaggio pubblicato ieri dalla Marquett University avrebbe ridotto a quattro punti lo svantaggio nei confronti di Biden. Che il Wisconsin sia un terreno di battaglia privilegiato lo testimonia anche l'arrivo in contemporanea questa settimana del vice di Trump, Mike Pence, e dell'aspirante vice di Biden, Kamala Harris. Negli ultimi giorni, tuttavia, il comitato elettorale del capo della Casa Bianca sembra essersi convinto di poter recuperare terreno anche in Michigan, dove infatti Trump si sta recando proprio in queste ore (seguendo di un giorno Biden).

EDWARDSVILLE — A Belleville woman was charged Thursday after prosecutors say she was driving drunk when she caused an accident that killed a woman and injured another person on Labor Day.


  Erin L. Arras, 44, was charged by the Madison County State's Attorney's Office with aggravated driving under the influence causing death, according to a statement released by the office Thursday.


  Alton police responded Monday to a report of a car hitting a motorcycle in the 700 block of West Broadway in Alton. Arras was driving a Nissan Altima that pulled out of a commercial parking lot and into the path of the motorcycle, prosecutors said.


  Natasha J. Dillinger, 27, of Bethalto, was a passenger on the motorcycle and suffered severe injuries in the crash. She died Wednesday. The driver of the motorcycle also was injured.

Twitter is the thing all corporations fear. All film productions fear. All directors fear. Actors. Writers. Anyone on the left in politics. It has corrupted journalism almost completely, becoming a useless feedback loop that simply confirms the story Twitter wants. Twitter likes it so it gets shared and amplified and stats are tabulated so more stories like that appear. The same is true across the board for movies and anything that can be impacted by Twitter. Like, the Oscars. You can criticize the decision to hire Kevin Hart -- please don't, we know, we get it -- but the fact remains that no one is perfect enough to both host the Oscars and draw high ratings. If there were then a replacement would have have be easy to find. Twitter is the problem. It takes criticism to entirely new levels of hate into the realm of public humiliation. That is really what Twitter is. It's the arena. It's the Colosseum. It's the town square. And until it becomes powerless we all remain at its mercy. For better and worse, but let's face it, mostly worse.

Kreamer and Hammersley joined the project after it had already been greenlit, and once they were onboard the pair resolved to make a kids show that didn’t play it safe (something Spielberg wanted too). They yearned to make a kids show that would give younger audiences the freedom to experience and understand danger, like the _Jurassic_ movies do. The showrunners took inspiration from films where kids face actual peril — oftentimes without an adult, gadget, or superpower to help them out. Not-so-coincidentally, this ended up being a lot of classic Spielberg works, including _E.T._ , _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_ , _The Goonies_ , and obviously the original _Jurassic Park._


  “I think that you couldn’t really do a _Jurassic_ story without having those elements of putting people in real danger. Because otherwise, if you don’t have that, it’s not going to feel like a _Jurassic Park_ or _Jurassic World_ film. So to us, it was it was really just kind of keep in line with the world that they’ve already created,” Hammersley said.


   _Camp Cretaceous_ earns its place in the “actual peril” category, as well as its PG rating. While Kreamer and Hammersley insisted the series never display blood or gore onscreen, there are still times where things get intense. Sometimes, the teens even watch other people be eaten by dinosaurs. — it may not be bloody, but it _is_ violent, and that can be a lot to handle. Hammersley said it was about letting young characters be in peril instead of always making things feel safe — and trusting the audience to understand what all of that means.

Before Astarte Medical was founded, I would say I was much more comfortable staying behind the scenes, being supportive but not putting myself in the spotlight — ever. But when it comes to startups and fundraising, it’s all hands on deck. I had to push aside my fears and give the company pitch, as often as we were given the opportunity, whether it was to an individual investor or on stage with an audience of 200 people. In the beginning, I stressed myself out in unhealthy ways over every single pitch. I have now learned the key to releasing and relieving that stress and anxiety is preparation, practice, and confidence. When preparing for a high stakes meeting or presentation, always remember that no one knows your business better than you do. That realization is game changing.

I enjoyed my work and found satisfaction in my accomplishments, but never at any time did they include promoting myself, speaking to an audience, or in any way shape or form “putting myself out there”. As co-founder of Astarte Medical, I have had to push myself out of my comfort zone and do whatever it takes to make the team and the company successful. Stepping up and getting out there has resulted in a confidence level that was previously unknown to me and has led to a tremendous amount of both personal and professional growth and was a key driver in closing our financing.

Winning and losing our most significant client would have to be the most valuable lesson in business I’ve learned to date. The story is quite fascinating when I think back on it. We had won the client first, which led to creating the agency and hiring five people to run the account. We were responsible for their entire marketing and pr strategy. In a way, the company appointed me as their CMO, so the account was quite significant. Our team dedicated so much time and energy into helping this particular client that, as a business owner, I did not have time to generate leads to grow and diversify our clientele. Eight months into the project, the client’s investors pulled out, which meant all marketing stopped, and we lost the business, having to fill a 30K per month void with high operating expenses. I struggled to sleep for an entire year as we worked to replace the loss. This moment became a wake-up call to me and changed how I would move forward with running the company. The experience was a hard pill to swallow yet, I learned so much about business, planning and forecasting. You should always have more eggs in your basket. Always.

Bob Wynhausen called me out for ignoring the, "Southern Strategy" in my recent, "As I See It" column. I did address it, but it was inadvertently left out of the GT's print edition. Here it is:
 "Nixon's so-called "Southern Strategy?” It entailed wooing discontented Democrats with a conservative message stressing states' rights, smaller government, law and order, and no busing — but no racism, no segregation. This message resonated with some, but many Democrats heard the siren song of (former Democrat) George Wallace and his segregationist American Independent Party. Wallace carried five deep South states in the 1968 presidential election, and it was with him that the racists found succor, not within the Republican ranks. Nixon supported both the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, and introduced the first Affirmative Action plan in 1970."

Awkwafina also missed in lead. That isn't Little Women's fault, but once an actor or writer or director has their place in line it becomes much harder to knock it out. In the end, the voters liked Little Women more than they liked Hustlers. Or else the push for Little Women was stronger. Either way, neither of these films were better than the films that were at the top of the pile. And if you aren't talking about something that is actually BEST but best because people demand inclusion then you need to get everyone on board at the same time with that performance or movie.

Va tuttavia ricordato che il voto per il presidente in carica potrebbe essere sottostimato, come già accaduto in occasione delle elezioni del 2016. Ulteriore conferma ne è un sondaggio pubblicato oggi dall’istituto Rasmussen, secondo il quale il 17 per cento degli elettori statunitensi che approvano fortemente l’operato di Trump non rivela la propria intenzione di voto. Per ottenere un secondo mandato alla Casa Bianca, il presidente uscente avrebbe bisogno di vincere in almeno uno dei tre maggiori Stati della Rust Belt (Michigan, Pennsylvania e Wisconsin) e replicare la vittoria di quattro anni fa in Florida. In questo caso, un motivo di ottimismo per l’inquilino della Casa Bianca è dato dal fatto che Biden fatica a conquistare il voto degli ispanici in Florida, come scrive oggi il “Miami Herald” citando un sondaggio condotto da Bendixen & Amandi nella contea storicamente democratica di Miami- Dade. Le rilevazioni indicano un vantaggio importante a favore di Biden, pari a 17 punti percentuali. L’ex vice di Barack Obama avrebbe il sostegno del 55 per cento degli intervistati contro il 38 per cento a favore del presidente in carica, Donald Trump. Tuttavia, ricorda il “Miami Herald”, il capo della Casa Bianca “non ha bisogno di vincere a Miami-Dade”: lo dimostra quanto accaduto nel 2016, quando la contea è andata a Hillary Clinton con un margine di distacco di ben 30 punti percentuali (circa 290 mila voti) ma lo Stato a Trump con un margine dell’1,2 per cento. Il sondaggio mostra Biden in vantaggio tra gli elettori indipendenti (51 contro 33) e tra i bianchi (48 contro 44).

In order to really make the best self tape possible you have to have some understanding of on screen or camera acting. I took a camera acting class with Brooke Elliot through Broadway Arts Collective and I totally recommend finding a workshop or class that focuses on this. What I learned is that when on camera you need to know what kind of theatre you are performing in. In a self tape it's important to know what the filming requirements are. Most of the time it's a medium or close up shot which means that you're performing in a smaller theatre. You don't need to make choices to translate to the back row of the mezzanine you need it to translate to a 25-50 person audience. I found that this advice that Brooke gave in the workshop made acting on camera very easy to understand for a person who has only ever performed on stage. You have to know the size of your shot or audience.

  "This year, the Denver Film Festival comes to you," says festival director Britta Erickson, in a statement announcing the move. "In terrific times, and in challenging ones, the Denver Film Festival has stood strong for 42 years -- and this year will be no exception. Though we won't be gathered in dark theaters together, the strong spirit, uncompromising programming, and, most importantly, the very best in cinema from around the world will be showcased in living rooms, on laptops, and wherever you find us. We are honored and excited to bring this world-class cinema experience to you."


  Denver Film, the nonprofit that throws the festival each year, was forced to shut down its brick-and-mortar operations after COVID-19 hit. While its Sie FilmCenter home is available for rentals, the venue has yet to reopen for movies. But all along, the organization has continued to offer programming by creating a Virtual Cinema platform and renting out new films to patrons weekly. Now festival audiences will be able to access more than 100 festival films from October 22 through November 8 through that platform and the Denver Film app on Roku TV or Apple TV.

“Known as Windsor’s Songbird, Ms. Bannister used her musical talents to bring a great deal of joy to our school,” Denise Quickel, principal of Windsor Elementary, said of Bannister, who had taught at the school for five years. “For our school’s Attendance Matters kickoff in 2019 she wrote a song about the importance of coming to school to the tune of ‘Old Town Road’. The song and video were a big hit with our school family. Ms. Bannister loved her students and never missed an opportunity to advocate for students and public education.”

"Sesame Street" led the way and numerous other series have followed suit, especially in the world of animation. When it comes to animation the rules are limitless -- and that extends to creating a landscape populated with disability. "In an animated world there's no reason not to [include disabled characters]," said Johanna Stein, executive producer of the animated kids' show "Madagascar: A Little Wild." Because an animated show creates everything from scratch, there's no reason not to fill it with more disabled characters than you'd find anywhere else.

Rather than help local small farmers to improve their yield per acre, the AGRA merely repackages the 1960’s Green Revolution in Mexico and India for Africa, home to some of the world’s richest farmland soils. That Green Revolution of the 1960s, initiated by the Rockefeller Foundation, introduced industrial large-scale agriculture mechanization and introduction of chemical fertilizers and seeds from multinationals which went to the benefit of large farmers and destroyed much of the economy of small producers. That predictably bankrupted countless small producers. The result was that while select wealthy producers thrived, millions of poorer farmers were forced to flee to the cities where they settled in urban slums. But that in fact was a major aim of the first Green Revolution as it created a cheap workforce for the globalization drive of manufacture that was to follow.

It’s also necessary to lead by example. As a female in a male-dominated industry, I had to work 10x harder than my male counterparts in order to be taken seriously. As such, I made sure that over half of my company’s engineering team is female. It’s one thing to talk the talk, but by actually walking the walk, I set an example for my colleagues, employees, but also my family members.

CP/Sean KilpatrickMarc Kielburger, screen left, and Craig Kielburger, screen right, appear as witnesses via videoconference during a House of Commons finance committee in the Wellington Building in Ottawa on July 28, 2020.
 Both Trudeau and Morneau did not recuse themselves from discussions related to the program, despite both their families having long-standing personal ties with the Toronto-based international charity.
 The prime minister and Morneau face federal ethics commissioner investigations over their role in the cancelled Canada Student Service Grant program.
 WE Charity also did not escape unscathed from the controversy. Co-founders and brothers Craig and Marc Kielburger announced Wednesday that they plan to close the organization's Canadian operations. The Kielburgers said they will also step down from their senior roles.
 "COVID-19 disrupted every aspect of our work," the brothers wrote in an open letter Wednesday. The financial reality for the charity's future is clear, it said.
 "The fallout from the Canada Student Service Grant has placed us as a charity in the middle of political battles and misinformation that we are ill-equipped to fight."

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, working in tandem with the closely allied Rockefeller Foundation, is not only at the center of the orchestration of unheard-of severe economic lockdown measures for the much-disputed COVID-19 illness. The Gates foundation is also at the very center of the UN Agenda 30 push to transform world agriculture into what they call “sustainable” agriculture. A keystone project for the past 14 years has been Gates’ funding of something called the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa or AGRA.

Introducing 'Deep Dive': Damon Lindelof and His Team Go Behind the Scenes of 'Watchmen'

In case you haven’t noticed, the U.S. is in shambles right now. The West Coast is on fire, and hurricane season is in full swing with more storms on the way. Weeks after historic protests against racial injustice, we’ve seen few meaningful promises from political leaders to address the issue. And while nearly 900,000 Americans filed for unemployment last week amid a deadly pandemic, billionaires are making a killing.
 The THRIVE agenda — which is backed by staunch progressives like Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Ro Khanna, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren as well as moderates like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer — opens the door for addressing these issues all together. Recognising the sovereignty and right to self-governance of Indigenous nations, for instance, is a part of the new platform because it is a key way to improve quality of life for Native communities, and also because research shows that doing so can help draw down carbon emissions. Similarly, transitioning from fossil-based energy to renewable energy is necessary to create livable conditions for the Americans who live near polluting coal, oil and gas infrastructure, who are disproportionately poor and often Black, Latino, or Native. It is also absolutely critical to avoid climate breakdown.
 That transition will require a massive amount of new infrastructure, which someone has to build. That means jobs. The same goes for improving housing, broken water infrastructure, inefficient appliances, and access to broadband — improvements which are particularly necessary in low-income communities and communities of colour. In addition to jobs in creating and improving transit, water, energy, and building infrastructure, the resolution would also employ Americans to protect and restore the country’s wetlands — which sequester carbon from the atmosphere and are necessary for flood protection, improving water quality, and controlling dangerous erosion — and to grow food on sustainably run farms.
 All told, an independent analysis from economists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst estimates that the THRIVE agenda would create 16 million new jobs and sustain them over the next decade. That’s more than enough positions for the 14 million U.S. workers who are currently unemployed.
