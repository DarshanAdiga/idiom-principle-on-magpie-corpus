"He had severe trauma to the left and right side of his brain," said Rueb. "Doctors had to remove the skull piece to remove the pressure and to relieve the bleeding. His eyes were swollen shut. I think there were about 20 fractures up in the upper part of his mouth. So he could not chew or anything for quite a while."

I met Mario Cuomo quite early in the game. I had written a column suggesting that Ed Koch would be elected governor of New York and Cuomo asked me when he could be on my radio show. I was floored. We did the show and so began a long relationship that ended when Andrew announced that he would run against Carl McCall for the Democratic nomination for governor of New York.
 Frankly, I wasn’t happy about the decision that would have denied McCall the chance to be the first African American elected governor of New York. I spoke out in columns, in my TV appearances and on the radio. My good friend “The Guv,” a man I admired then and now, let me know in no uncertain terms that he was unhappy. After a long, long run, the show was over. Maybe I should have shut up, but that capacity is not in my DNA. While the show was running, I wrote a book, humorously titled Me and Mario: Conversations in Candor. When Mario died, I was devastated.
 When Andrew Cuomo was elected, I figured that there would be some distance between us. For his first two terms as governor, I couldn’t get near the guy. Hey, them’s the breaks. Then one day when I was on the air with our Roundtable Panel, the phone rang. It was the governor’s special assistant, saying that the governor wanted a chance to do a show with me. Our News Director, Ian Pickus, and I were both stunned. We not only did that show but many, many more. I was surprised by the chemistry. After all, we all knew about Mario’s sense of humor. I loved fencing with him and he almost always won in the jousts. My all-time favorite was when I said something and he asked, “Is that what you think?” When I replied that it was, he said, “Who cares?” Doesn’t get better than that.
 When these interviews with Andrew started, I was really surprised. Let’s face it -- Andrew has never really come across as a comedian. I was astounded. He can be really, really funny. Like Mario, his sense of humor is biting, sarcastic and penetrating. Mario used to make up profound sounding quotes and attribute them to A.J. Parkinson (there is no one of that name) and Andrew continues the tradition. Andrew has amazing recall of any alleged wrongs that have been done to him and in my case, he is always on me for having supported his primary opponent and he doesn’t stop. For whatever reason, I think that these attacks are really funny. Of course, Freud is reported to have said, “There is no joke.”

LONDON (AP) — A retired British shop clerk received the first shot in the country’s COVID-19 vaccination program Tuesday, the start of an unprecedented global immunization effort intended to offer a route out of a pandemic that has killed 1.5 million.
 Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, got the shot at 6:31 a.m. on what public health officials have dubbed “V-Day.” She was first in line at University Hospital Coventry, one of several hospitals around the country that are handling the initial phase of the United Kingdom’s program. As luck would have it, the second injection went to a man named William Shakespeare, an 81-year-old who hails from Warwickshire, the county where the bard was born.
 “I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against COVID-19,” said Keenan, who wore a surgical mask and a blue Merry Christmas T-shirt decorated with a cartoon penguin wearing a Santa hat. “It’s the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the New Year after being on my own for most of the year.”
 The U.K. is the first Western country to start a mass vaccination program after British regulators last week authorized the use of a COVID-19 shot developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech. U.S. and European Union regulators may approve the vaccine in the coming days or weeks, fueling a global immunization effort.

SYDNEY, Dec 8 (Reuters) - India captain Virat Kohli's breezy 85 went in vain as Australia prevailed by 12 runs in the final Twenty20 International to avoid a series whitewash at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday.
 Chasing 187 to sweep the three-match series, Kohli kept India in the hunt before falling in the penultimate over in the first full-capacity cricket match in Australia since the COVID-19 outbreak.
 Both sides were guilty of sloppy fielding and poor catching and Kohli was one of the beneficiaries.
 Steve Smith dropped him when Kohli was on nine, and Andrew Tye spilled a return catch when the batsman, who also survived a stumping opportunity later on, was on 19.
 Leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson (3-23), who dismissed Sanju Samson and Shreyas Iyer in his final over to hurt India's chase, was adjudged man-of-the-match.
 Earlier, Matthew Wade smashed a career-best 80 as he and Glenn Maxwell powered Australia to 186-5.
 Skipper Aaron Finch returned from a hip injury to score a duck and Smith made 24 before becoming spinner Washington Sundar's second victim.
 Maxwell joined Wade the middle and started messing with the bowlers' line and length by repeatedly playing the trademark reverse shots.
 The sloppy tourists did not help their cause either.
 Maxwell was caught at 18 at midwicket but was recalled after a replay confirmed spinner Yuzvendra Chahal had overstepped.
 Deepak Chahar dropped Maxwell on 46 in the deep and Chahal spilled another chance with Shardul Thakur being the luckless bowler on both occasions.
 T Natarajan eventually bowled Maxwell for 54 off 36 balls.
 Australia had won the preceding ODI series 2-1.
 The teams will now lock horns in a four-test series starting on Dec. 17 at Adelaide. (Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; editing by Christian Radnedge)

The selection of Becerra as health secretary and businessman Jeff Zients as White House coronavirus coordinator point to a more assertive federal coronavirus role.
 Under Trump, states were sometimes left to figure things out themselves, as when the White House initially called on states to test all nursing home residents without providing an infrastructure, only to have to rectify that omission later.
 Zients has made a name for himself rescuing government programs that went off course, such as the "Obamacare" HealthCare.gov website. Becerra has experience managing California's attorney general's office, which is bigger than some state governments.

A panel of independent scientists will pick apart the FDA’s first-pass review before recommending whether the vaccine appears safe and effective enough for millions of Americans. The FDA, which typically follows the committee’s advice, is expected to issue a decision in the days following the review.

 The conference was being streamed through Microsoft Teams, but was inaccessible to people who were logged in to that programme through a company- issued computer and a company account – which is to say, quite a lot of people.

It's also a useful thing to have handy if you manage to do yourself an injury while you're out and about, so make sure you replace any items that you take out of the kit.

The Pentagon announced last month that the U.S. will reduce troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan by mid-January, asserting that the decision fulfills Trump's pledge to bring forces home from America's long wars. Under the accelerated pullout, the U.S. will cut the number of troops in Afghanistan from more than 4,500 to 2,500, and in Iraq from about 3,000 to 2,500.
 Postponing the return of the Nimitz, however, will keep between 5,000-7,000 sailors and Marines in the Middle East, likely into next year. Other ships in the Nimitz strike group may remain with the carrier.
 The military official said that the Pentagon will look at other ways to make up for the loss of the Nimitz when the carrier does leave the region.
 Trump's troop withdrawal decision got a cool reception from Republican lawmakers and allies, who warned of the dangers of reducing forces before security conditions are right. And it came despite arguments from senior military officials who favor a slower pullout to preserve hard-fought gains.
 Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, top U.S. commander for the Middle East, has long argued for a consistent aircraft carrier presence in the Gulf region to deter Iran.
 Visiting the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman in the North Arabian Sea in February, McKenzie told the sailors: "You're here because we don't want a war with Iran and nothing makes a potential adversary think twice about war than the presence of an aircraft carrier and the strike group that comes with it."
 Despite widespread demands for U.S. Navy ships in other parts of the world, McKenzie requested and received a much larger than usual naval presence in the Middle East region throughout the early part of this year. But over time, the numbers have declined, in recognition of the Pentagon's effort to put more emphasis on China and the Indo-Pacific.

Make a wire cage for the leaves so they don’t blow away, or keep in black plastic bags with a little soil added to help them break down, and a few punctures in the bag.

The governor urges Illinoisans to stay ahead of the curve by remaining cautious this holiday season. Large family gatherings can become super-spreader events, and Illinois is the fourth worst state in the country regarding COVID-19 cases. Travel and large gatherings can exacerbate spikes in coronavirus spread, which may cause another lockdown. Pritzker states that staying at home now, willingly, can prevent a mandatory stay-at-home order in the future. The sooner people cooperate, the sooner everyone can get back to normal.

The first shot was given to Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, at University Hospital Coventry, one of several hospitals around the country that are handling the initial phase of the program on what has been dubbed “V-Day.” As luck would have it, the second injection went to a man named William Shakespeare, an 81-year-old who hails from Warwickshire, the county where the bard was born.

Those issues run the gamut, from accessibility to medical care, that so many of us need in order to live life as ourselves. I have been lucky enough to avoid most of the problems of transitioning and violence but so many of the people I consider my trans siblings aren’t so lucky. Such is the extent of that violence, even now, that the week concludes with Trans Day of Remembrance, a day devoted to remembering all the trans lives lost across the country over the past year.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 launch is expected to take place in a few weeks, but the build-up excitement might have just hit a speed bump - it looks like there won't be a charger or headphones in the box.

Oh, by the way, Edinburg won the game, 35-21.
 Afterward, Edinburg coach J.J. Lejia was asked about the incident.
 "I can't release any information on that, and I apologize for that," Lejia said. "I hope you understand.
 "I want this (moment) to be about our program and all the other kids we had on the field tonight."
 Ideally it should have been, and you can understand as a leader of young people why Lejia would want that to be the case.
 Duron's poor decision shouldn't reflect on his teammates and community.
 Yes, it was in the heat of the moment.
 And yes, even for something that egregious, there should eventually be a path to forgiveness.
 Unfortunately, after a decision of that magnitude, it's impossible to constrain the effect.
 The following day, Edinburg removed itself from the playoffs.
 "The district has decided to remove the Edinburg High School football team from the playoffs after an unexpected incident involving a student that occurred during a football game on December 3, 2020," the Edinburg Consolidated Independent School District wrote in a prepared statement. "We extend a sincere apology to the referee and his family. On behalf of the Edinburg CISD Board of Trustees and administration, we apologize to the athletes, staff and our school community."
 Duron was later charged with assault and posted bond, and at last report, Gracia was in concussion protocol.
 Here's to hoping Gracia makes a full recovery.

One name that comes off the top of your head is Italian coach Marcelo Lippi who won the UEFA Champions League with Juventus (1995-96) before winning the AFC Champions League with Guangzhou Evergrande (2013).

The U.K. has agreed to buy more than 350 million doses of vaccine from seven different producers. Governments around the world are making agreements with multiple developers to ensure they lock in delivery of the products that are ultimately approved for widespread use.
 All of those logistical challenges culminated in nurse May Parsons inserting a syringe into Keenan’s left shoulder and depressing the plunger to deliver the vaccine. Parsons, originally from the Philippines, has worked for the NHS for the past 24 years.
 “I’m just glad to be able to play a part on this historic day,” she said. “The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS, but now it feels like there is a light at the end of the tunnel.”

Take stock of your gardening year. Do not be disheartened by your gardening imperfections or failures, but devote some time to pondering what you will do differently in the coming year.

While state spending increased mostly across the board, general fund revenues declined for the first time in more than a decade. There was an overall decline in general fund tax collections in fiscal 2020, although "most states were seeing strong revenue growth and tax collections coming in above projections" over the first three quarters, according to the report. One revenue category that took a particularly big hit was gaming and lottery, which declined nearly 13%, due at least in part to casinos closing during the pandemic.

A panel of independent scientists will pick apart the FDA’s first-pass review before recommending whether the vaccine appears safe and effective enough for millions of Americans. The FDA, which typically follows the committee’s advice, is expected to issue a decision in the days following the review. If given the green light, the first recipients would be health care workers and nursing home residents according to plans laid out by each state.

MELBOURNE, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Opening batsman Will Pucovski retired hurt in Australia A's tour match against India A on Tuesday after being struck in the helmet by a bouncer, raising fears about his fitness for the first test against India next week.
 Pucovski, who was tipped to partner with opener Joe Burns at Adelaide Oval, was hit by a short ball from paceman Kartik Tyagi when on 23 late on the third and final day at Drummoyne Oval in Sydney.
 The 22-year-old dropped his bat and remained on hands and knees on the pitch for a few moments.
 After being examined by a trainer, Pucovski got to his feet and was able to walk off unassisted.
 However, given his history of concussion problems, Australia's selectors are likely to be very cautious about risking him for his debut in the pink-ball test at Adelaide Oval starting Dec. 17. (Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Lincoln Feast)
