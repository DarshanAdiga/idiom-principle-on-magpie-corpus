Several rockets believed to be targeting US troops were launched near Erbil airport in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq on Wednesday, a Kurdish security agency said.
 The attack in Erbil, a rare target for rockets, is considered a serious escalation by Iraqi officials and it came hours after Iraq's prime minister had pledged to improve protection of foreign missions in his country.

 "Six rockets were launched from the borders of the Sheikh Amir village in Nineveh province by the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) who were targeting coalition forces in Erbil International Airport," Iraqi Kurdistan's counterterrorism service said.
 The PMF are an umbrella group composed of mostly Iran-backed Iraqi Shiite militias that is part of Iraq's armed forces.
 According to the statement, the missiles were intercepted and did not cause any major damage. But one of the rockets is said to have hit the headquarters of an Iranian-Kurdish opposition party that is banned in Iran, the Iraqi Kurdistan's counterterrorism service said.
 US Army Colonel Wayne Marotto, spokesman for the US-led coalition, confirmed that initial reports indicated that indirect fire did not land on coalition forces in Erbil.
 "There was no damage or casualties. Incident is under investigation," he wrote on Twitter.

Royal Canadian Legion, Branch 90, on Oak Street in Brantford is closing, a legion official confirmed Wednesday.
 "Pending approval by Ontario Command, Branch 90 will be amalgamating with South Brant Legion" in Oakland, said Diane Hodges, commander for the legion's Zone B2, which covers Brantford and Brant and Oxford counties.
 She said the move isn't related to COVID-19.
 "Branch 90 has been having problems for quite some time and plans for amalgamation were well underway prior to the pandemic."
 She said that, once provincial approval is received, the Branch 90 hall will be put up for sale.
 "Yes, it's sad," Hodges said. "And, yes, I wouldn't be surprised if there were not more amalgamations in the future. It's a sign of the times."
 She said the legion was seeing declining memberships prior to COVID-19.
 "And the pandemic and the shutdown certainly haven't helped matters."
 A spokesperson for Branch 90 declined to comment.
 There are 13 legion halls in Zone B2.
 Many halls were forced to temporarily close their doors when the pandemic hit in mid-March. While some have reopened with limited hours, most are struggling. Activities, such as dart and pool leagues, have stopped, as has holding functions, such as wedding receptions and live music events, because capacity limits imposed by the province.
 "When you're limited to 50 people or fewer than even that, it's hard to even cover your costs," said Hodges, adding that legion halls are increasingly reliant on volunteers.
 Meanwhile, there is concern about how COVID-19 will impact the annual poppy campaign.
 Traditional poppy boxes will be set up but legion branches are being discouraged from setting up donation tables with volunteers. People can also donate through the legion's national website at legion.ca/donations .
 According to the legion, nearly $20 million is donated nationally during the poppy campaign, with proceeds used to support veterans and their families.
 In response to the pandemic, the legion is selling masks online at www.poppystore.ca/ .
 On Remembrance Day on Nov. 11, the legion will offer a Facebook live presentation of the National Remembrance Day ceremony. Spectators are being discouraged from attending in person because of limited space and physical distancing requirements.
 Remembrance Day ceremony plans have yet to be finalized in Brantford and Brant County.

Sinuous grooves and heated horns come hand-in-hand with Staten Island's Budos Band, as their many fans -- Madonna, Iggy Pop, and the Wu-Tang Clan among them -- know well. The eight-piece group has spent the last 15 years making instrumental music that defies easy comparison, mixing retro organs with arcs of brass, deadly strings, and stark percussion. Their style falls somewhere between 1960s spy thriller soundtrack and 1970s Ethiojazz, and yet is continuously cutting-edge, a signature sound unlike any other.
 The new track, "The Wrangler", exemplifies that. Out ahead of album _Long in the Tooth_ , coming out 9 October on Daptone Records, it's as urgent a tune as the band has ever given us. "When we set out to record this album, we didn't know we would be releasing it during such a dark and ominous period in our history," the band notes. "'The Wrangler' emanates the grand perception of apocalypse we are currently experiencing."

"They were barking at me and yelling at me when I went to serve," Schneckloth, who was on Weilbrenner's team for the scrimmage, added. "A lot of the kids knew me, so I think they were just having fun with it. At least that's what I hope."
 In the end, the match was a fun night to display the overall talent of the Bulldogs. Vonderhaar and Anne Guest ended up on the winning end of the scrimmage as part of the team that came out on top 25-20 in the third and decisive game over the side that included Schneckloth and Weilbrenner, rallying from a 17-9 deficit in the final game.
 "It really showed how we can push through even when we're having a bad moment," Vonderhaar said. "I think that's when the competition really got taken up another level. That's when I personally really got that feeling of wanting to win just like in any other match."
 Guest, Ottumwa's top attacker nearing 700 career kills, was face to face several times during the scrimmage with her friends and teammates at the net. Guest and Schneckloth went head-to-head, so to speak, several times looking for points.
 "It was just a bit awkward. Chloe and I just kept giving each other looks. She would pass up some of my hits. She'd give me the same look if I passed up one of her hits," Guest said. "It was just a fun moment between us. We went against each other several times just to see, for fun, who would come out on top.
 "I knew I was going to be going up against Anne. It's middle against middle and obviously, she came out on top," Schneckloth added. "I've played against Anne for years. I know how to read her. That helped in the back row, but in the front row she really did a great job hammering it through my blocks."
 When Ottumwa does take the court next time, they'll be back in their 2020 uniforms. This past week allowed Thomas and the Bulldog players to go back in time breaking out uniforms that were worn by some of the all-time great Ottumwa volleyball players over the past three decades, uniforms that current OHS players got to personally select.
 "That was one of the best things about this, getting to see the girls at the team dinner on Monday go through all the uniforms," Thomas said. "They found the old sweatsuits. They wore those to school on Tuesday. They were just hilarious at the team dinner having fun in the uniforms. I was very involved when my girls played and I kept score for the high school team when I was the middle school coach, but I didn't really pay attention to uniforms. It was fun to see where it's evolved and compare the uniforms of today to what they've been in the past."
 Ottumwa (10-6) is scheduled to get back on the court for regular-season action in a triangular with Ankeny at Norwalk on Saturday. While they are hoping to be able to fill in the remaining four dates that are open on their schedule with all CIML Metro matches currently canceled for the 2020 season, Tuesday's battle of the Bulldog spikers was a worthwhile alternative to a night with no volleyball action to take part in.
 "I did have a lot more fun than I thought I would," Guest added. "It was better than not having a match at all.
 "We got the chance to make memories. It's something we'll always get to remember from this season," Vonderhaar said.

LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - In 2005, Hurricane Rita obliterated the South Cameron Memorial Hospital and it’s deja vu all over again now that the dust has settled from Hurricane Laura.It’s been just over one month since Hurricane Laura and residents in Cameron haven’t had much access to emergency services.“You can see where the stormwater and debris was," said South Cameron Hospital CEO and Operator Leslie Trahan.15 years of progress for the South Cameron Hospital destroyed yet again by mother nature...“So yeah, we just have to plan to be on temporary power for the extended future," Trahan said.Eerie images show the initial aftermath of the storm and the destruction left behind on a hospital that was newly built to withstand tropical weather after Hurricane Rita.In the last few weeks since Hurricane Laura ravaged much of what was left of the Cameron coast, there has been major progress in restoring healthcare int he parish.“I’m a huge advocate for access to healthcare and access to an emergency department and life-saving measures," Trahan said. This hospital being here means life and death for a lot of people.”With the nearest emergency room nearly an hour away from residents. Trahan says overcoming adversity is nothing new for those still living and working in the parish.“This is 3 times in 15 years, it gets harder every time. But it’s not something you give up, it’s not something that you stop and say I don’t want to do this anymore.”“It’s really just a makeshift ordeal but it’s designed to stay here for the long haul," said Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) Region 4 Administrative Coordinator Donnie Simon.With the assistance of healthcare providers in Terrebonne and Lafayette Parishes, Cameron will now have a means to an end for emergency services in the aftermath of Laura.“Early assessment has been to at least January. Depending on the infrastructure and utilities, we’re certainly prepared to keep it here longer," Simon said.Trahan says they hope to have the makeshift hospital up and running sometime next week. It will be operated by doctors and nurses from South Cameron Memorial Hospital.The plan is for it to operate during non-curfew hours but it will transition to 24 hours once the curfew in Cameron Parish is lifted.Copyright 2020 KPLC.

It was all part of an intrasquad scrimmage as the formerly-ranked Bulldog spikers took the floor for the first time since dropping a tough three-set battle last Thursday with fifth-ranked (5A) Ankeny Centennial. With the scheduled CIML Metro battle with Des Moines North canceled as all extra- curricular activities within the Des Moines Public School system continue to be on hold, Ottumwa players split up and battled to the end in a best two-out- of-three set match played in front of a boisterous crowd that included a split student section.
 "Half of them went to one side and half of them went to other side, so each team got an equal amount of support," Ottumwa head volleyball coach Ruth Thomas said.
 Josie Vonderhaar, however, would quickly dispute that.
 "We had a lot more people on our side," Vonderhaar said with a smile.
 The brought a rebutal from Chloe Schneckloth, who for one night was Vonderhaar's opponent on the other side of the net.
 "They had a few more people that just sat there and didn't make any noise," Schneckloth said. "Our fans were up and cheering. They brought a flag to wave around. They brought a lot more enthusiasm."
 The battle on the court of Ottumwa vs. Ottumwa brought with it some unique trappings. Emma Weilbrenner, for one, noticed fans and friends that have been cheering her on throughout all four years as a Bulldog volleyball player suddenly show support for her 'opponents' during Tuesday's scrimmage.
 "They started out on our side playing fair game, then they switched over and started rooting against us," Weilbrenner joked. "They started doing that barking thing they do to our opponents. I felt like I was a visitor.

If they win, it’s great, but if not, he’s provided reasons why they didn’t before the game.

"This is a president who has expressed his opposition to access to mail ballots and has also seemed to almost foreshadow the inevitability that this election will be one decided by the courts," said Kristen Clarke, executive director of the National Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
 That opposition was on display Tuesday during the first presidential debate when Trump launched into an extended argument against mail voting, claiming without evidence that it is ripe for fraud and suggesting mail ballots may be "manipulated."
 "This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen," the president said of the massive shift to mail voting prompted by the pandemic.
 The lawsuits are a likely precursor for what will come afterward. Republicans say they have retained outside law firms, along with thousands of volunteer lawyers at the ready. Democrats have announced a legal war room of heavyweights, including a pair of former solicitors general.
 The race is already regarded as the most litigated in American history, due in large part to the massive expansion of mail and absentee voting. Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt, a former Justice Department elections official, has tallied some 260 lawsuits arising from the coronavirus. The Republication National Committee says it's involved in more than 40 lawsuits, and a website operated by a chief Democrat lawyer lists active cases worth watching in about 15 states.
 Democrats are focusing their efforts on multiple core areas — securing free postage for mail ballots, reforming signature-match laws, allowing ballot collection by third-parties like community organizations and ensuring that ballots postmarked by Election Day can count. Republicans warn that those same requests open the door to voter fraud and confusion and are countering efforts to relax rules on how voters cast ballots this November.
 "We're trying to prevent chaos in the process," RNC chief counsel Justin Riemer said in an interview. "Nothing creates more chaos than rewriting a bunch of rules at the last minute."
 But there have been no broad-based, sweeping examples of voter fraud during past presidential elections, including in 2016, when Trump claimed the contest would be rigged and Russians sought to meddle in the outcome.
 Some of the disputes are unfolding in states not traditionally thought of as election battlegrounds, such as Montana, where there is a highly competitive U.S. Senate race on the ballot. A judge Wednesday rejected an effort by Trump's reelection campaign and Republican groups to block counties from holding the general election mostly by mail.
 But most of the closely watched cases are in states perceived as up-for-grabs in 2020 and probably crucial to the race.

MOOSIC — John "Kuch" Kuchinski, age 58, a lifelong resident of Moosic, passed away unexpectedly on Sunday afternoon at home. Surviving is his high school sweetheart and beloved wife of 35 years, Robin (Coleman) Kuchinski — whose heart will forever be broken by the loss of her best friend and the greatest love of her life.
 Born in Scranton on Feb. 1, 1962, and son of the late Henry "Hank" and Tekla "Tek" (Rushefski) Kuchinski, John was a graduate of Riverside High School, Class of 1980. He worked as a supervisor for Cinram in Olyphant for 30 years prior to its closure, before also serving as supervisor for Topps Co., Inc., in Scranton, for the past 10 years.
 With a vigorous support for and pride in his country, John was a true patriot. He was a longtime volunteer for the Greenwood Hose Company, where he had also served as past assistant chief. Devoted to the outdoors, "hunting, fishing and loving everyday" was a motto all knew John to live by. Often riding his quad, picking mushrooms and never missing the opportunity to go hunting or fishing. He was also a member of the Moosic Sportsman Club.
 With a passion for sports, John was a die-hard fanatic of the N.Y. Yankees and Pittsburgh Steelers; which we know he'll ensure are on their Stairway to Seven! He was also the horseshoes-king. An amazing cook, he will long be remembered for his hot sausage and kielbasa.
 When in doubt, you could find Kuch in his garage, which was always open! Neil Young and Bob Dylan were always playing on full blast and John was always playing air guitar on a level or broom. The garage was an open invitation: no one called — anyone and everyone showed up at any time and John loved every moment of it.
 A perfectionist who took pride in everything he did, he always made sure to do the right thing — and he always did. He was a deeply loyal friend who adored his family and truly loved every day of his life.
 Taken too soon, he will be deeply missed by his loving family and countless friends.
 Of Roman Catholic faith, he was a member of Queen of the Apostles Parish in Avoca.
 He is also survived by his adoring daughters, Kaitlyn Falandysz and husband, Bobby, of Moosic and Lindsay Dunn and husband, Philip, of Duryea; his grandson, who certainly loved his "grumpy", Philip John Coleman Dunn; his siblings, Andrea Schroff and husband, Dr. Richard, of Carrollton, Va., Henry and James Kuchinski, both of Moosic and Michael Kuchinski, of Mechanicsburg; his father-in-law and mother-in-law, John and Camille "Cookie" Coleman, of Moosic; his sisters-in-law, Camille Chickeletti and husband, Bruce and Kim Coleman Potter and husband, Frank; nieces and nephews; and a man's true best friend, his blood hound, Jessie Jean.
 Details for a Memorial Mass at Queen of the Apostles Parish in Avoca will be announced.
 With John being President Donald Trump's #1 supporter, it's only fitting that memorial contributions may be made in John's name to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., c/o 725 Fifth Ave., New York, N.Y., 10022.
 Arrangements are under the care of the Thomas P. Kearney Funeral Home, Inc., 517 N. Main St., Old Forge.
 Please visit the funeral home's website to leave a condolence.

Amongst all this turmoil that is being broadcasted by the media each day, the Black Lives Matter Foundation (BLM) has failed to put forth a national narrative for its chapters that explicitly condemns violence in any form. Although other leaders in the Black community have condemned violence, the BLM organization has yet to do so. Searching through BLM’s official website on Sept. 13, all sixteen recognized chapters recognized in the U.S. and Canada do not contain any non-violent language. Only one of the recognized leaders of BLM in Detroit calls herself a Non-violence activist. As of late September, the official BLM website has removed its list of recognized chapters.

A recent report by the Washington, D.C.-based Death Penalty Information Center said Black people remain overrepresented on death rows and that Black people who kill white people are far more likely to be sentenced to death than white people who kill Black people.
 Of the 55 inmates currently on federal death row, nearly 50% are Black, according to center data updated Wednesday; round 40%, are white and some 12% Latino. There is one Asian on federal death row. Black people make up only about 13% of the population.
 Federal authorities executed just three prisoners in the previous 56 years. Death penalty foes accuse President Donald Trump of restarting them to help stake a claim as the law-and-order candidate in the Nov. 3 election.

The head of the Federal Aviation Administration conducted his own test flight of a Boeing 737 Max Wednesday, and he's giving it a positive review, as the regulatory agency gets closer to allowing the troubled jet to return to commercial passenger service more than a year after it was grounded.      The plane has been prohibited from flying since March of 2019, after a 737 Max operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed shortly after takeoff from the airport in Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board. That was the second 737 Max to crash in less than five months; the first crash happened in Indonesia on Oct. 27, 2018, killing 189 people.      Both crashes were caused in part by a flawed automated flight control system, called MCAS, that was activated by faulty data from a single sensor, and repeatedly forced the planes into nose dives as the pilots struggled to regain control.      FAA Administrator Steve Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines pilot, sat at the controls of a 737 Max and flew it through a number of different scenarios to test how the plane handled in crisis situations and to evaluate Boeing's revisions to the flight control system.

OTTUMWA — Ottumwa's residents will have to wait a little longer to find out which business will be their solid waste collector starting next year.
 The city council voted 4-1 against approving Sparta Waste Services' bid for the residential trash, recycling, bulky items and yard waste contract during Tuesday's special meeting at Bridge View Center.
 Bridge City Sanitation, the current holder of the contract, is not yet out of the running. At the end of the meeting, councilman Bob Meyers motioned to offer an amended contract to Bridge City. The issue will be discussed at next week's board meeting.

 Amidst the violent protests in Kenosha, Wis., one prominent voice was ignored as arson and looting broke out in the city and an armed vigilante killed two people. That voice was Jacob Blake’s mother. After demonstrators torched cars and local businesses, Julia Jackson denounced the violence done in her son’s name. "We will not excuse the actions of the Kenosha Police Department, but his mother asks everyone to please remain peaceful,” according to a tweet from Blake’s cousin.
