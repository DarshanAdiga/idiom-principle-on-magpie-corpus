The recent reversal in the stock market has the potential to expedite the long anticipated "Silver Tsunami." A June 2019 Fannie Mae report tallied the number of homes owned by boomers and the generation that preceded at about 46 million, more than a third of the 140-million-home housing stock. Zillow Group Inc. predicts "upwards of 20 million homes hitting the market through the mid-2030s (which) will provide a substantial and sustained boost to supply, comparable to the fluctuations that new home construction experienced in the 2000s boom-bust cycle."
 But now, the number of homes Zillow projected to hit the market in a disciplined fashion over the next 15 years will become an exodus as retirees' need to monetize the equity in their homes to supplement their disposable income skyrockets. One can only imagine how swiftly home prices will decline once boomers feel safe enough to open their homes to outsiders as part of the normal sales process. The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for April that was released Thursday showed that plans to buy a home tumbled the most since 1979.
 The capping of deductions at $10,000 has already led to a 10% to 25% discount on home prices in high tax states relative to their lower-tax counterparts. Anticipated increases in property taxes to offset collapsing state and municipal budgets will amplify the damage inflict on those on fixed incomes.
 A complete unknown that could increase the coming surge in supply is the pool of single-family rentals. About eight million landlords who own between one and 10 properties accounting for half the nation's rental properties, according to Avail, a software company that caters to landlords. Financial duress will come swiftly for those carrying multiple mortgages. Also, a small cohort of institutional investors own roughly 250,000 of the roughly 16 million pool of rental homes, according to ATTOM Data Solutions.
 Making matters worse is the crash in demand for jumbo mortgages, which are those over the $510,400 conforming loan ceiling. Wells Fargo & Co. recently announced that it was halting the purchase of jumbo mortgages that originate from other lenders. Investors are sticking with government-backed loans which have greater security given payments will still be received even if borrowers have been granted forbearance. In the last downturn it took almost five years to close the premium charged to attain a jumbo mortgage over rates on conforming mortgages.

And when Iran asked the International Monetary Fund for a $5-billion loan to help keep the economy afloat during the pandemic, nobody was surprised when the Trump administration blocked the funds.
 When Iran asked for relief from U.S. sanctions, Pompeo called the idea “a scam.”
 In a statement that came close to gloating, he added, “The Iranian leadership is trying to avoid responsibility for their grossly incompetent and deadly governance.”
 This is a poisonous relationship, and both governments are behaving badly.
 I hold no brief for Iran, which I covered after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Its regime is brutal, repressive and corrupt. The Trump administration is under no moral obligation to send cash to Tehran.
 But U.S. sanctions don’t just prevent Iran from selling oil, its only major source of foreign income. They don’t only stop Iran from buying weapons or nuclear technology.
 They also make it difficult for Iran to buy food, medicine and medical supplies on the open market — which is what Tehran needs now.
 On paper, the sanctions allow exceptions for humanitarian aid, mainly food and medical goods. Pompeo and other U.S. officials point to those clauses as proof of their benevolence toward Iran’s beleaguered people.

Star midfielder Radja Nainggolan refused to discuss Roma's chances of winning the Scudetto, calling on his team to remain focused.
 Without Serie A glory since 2000-01, Roma find themselves fifth in the table and five points adrift of leaders Napoli after 11 games.
 Eusebio Di Francesco's Roma – with nine wins so far – have a game in hand on Napoli but Belgium international Nainggolan does not want to talk about the title.
 "I don't want to talk about the Scudetto," Nainggolan told Sky Sport Italia.
 "We are on a good path, we need to stay focused."
 After stunning Premier League titleholders Chelsea 3-0 in the Champions League last week, Roma defeated Fiorentina 4-2 on Sunday.
 Nainggolan added: "Di Francesco makes everyone feel important, even those who play less give more because they know their chance will come.
 "We are ready and we are showing we are all on the same page. You can see that."

He released his debut album in 1971, and put out 19 studio albums in all. While wider mainstream success eluded him for years, he earned a sizeable following, including some of the 20th century’s greatest songwriters. Bob Dylan said in 2009: “Prine’s stuff is pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs.” Bonnie Raitt has celebrated his songwriting as “deceptively insightful. It’s at once playing on words and imagery, but expressing something deeper in such a succinct way, in such an exceptional way.” Today, she said she was “crushed by the loss”.

Deși nu m-am gandit profund la implicațiile rasiste in acest moment, ar fi trebuit. Imediat ce mi-am dat seama am șters (in cateva minute). Nu este o scuză că nu trăiesc in Romania, ar fi trebuit să fac mai multe cercetări și să recunosc că acest lucru nu a fost amuzant, mai ales inainte de a distribui pe un forum public. Nu există nicio scuză. Mă voi descurca mai bine pe viitor, voi invăța din asta. Știu că unii pot să nu accepte scuzele astea sau să creadă ce spun și asta e dreptul lor. Știu că nu există cuvinte magice pentru a repara durerea pe care am provocat-o. Acestea fiind spuse, sunt deschis să lucrez cu cei care activează in comunitatea romilor despre cum să combatem ura, intoleranța și bigotismul. De asemenea, ințeleg că nu mi se datorează nimic din toate astea. Așa cum am spus, voi invăța din această greșeală și sper că reacția a arătat și altora că genul ăsta de glume nu sunt amuzante și dureroase pentru mulți. Pentru mine, intenționez să continui să petrec Paștele reflectand. Luni, revin la activitățile mele obișnuite. Mulțumesc celor care au scris pentru a-mi apăra reputația cat și celor care au fost critici cu bună credință", a scris el pe Facebook.

That’s changing but I wish it would change faster. You can teach people the skills to be founders, but if you ask any investor what are the most important attributes of founders they’ll say grit, resilience and the ability to think outside the box. These are things you learn from a very young age, or your life teaches you.”

Which, TBH was really the last time he'd done this whole courting thing, his only previous relationship being a seven-year romance with his high school sweetheart. "They were babies when they met, so Eric had no idea what it meant to date as an adult," she shared in her book. "Basically, he was raised to go dutch." His habit of splitting the bill on dates and never offering "to cover the bill or flights when I came in to visit him," was irksome and left the singer worried he might be broke.
