Organizers of the annual Garrit Nixon Memorial Golf Classic have announced that this year’s event has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “The COVID-19 pandemic has made a significant impact on the world that has affected us all in one way or another. Due to the pandemic, we have made the difficult decision to cancel the 2020 Garrit Nixon Memorial Golf Classic,” read a press release on the cancellation.
 “While this decision is disappointing, the health and safety of our golfers and volunteers is of the utmost importance, and we feel that cancelling the outing is the right decision for everyone involved.”
 Nixon, a 2002 graduate of Defiance High School and a football captain his senior year, died Dec. 27, 2003.
 Proceeds from the outing generate funds for the Garrit Nixon Scholarship, awarded each year to a senior member of the Defiance High School football team who exhibits outstanding leadership skills on and off the field and meets the academic and extracurricular requirements.
 The latest recipient of the scholarship was Tyrel Goings, who received $3,000.
 Each year the outing has strong cooperation and assistance from Nixon’s parents, Greg and Deb; sisters, Mackenzie and Shelby; and many of his classmates and their parents.
 “We will not be together this year, but rest assured the Garrit Nixon Memorial Golf Classic will be back. We have every intention of continuing the outing next year, and hope that you can join us again. We eagerly look forward to seeing everyone for a fun day of golf, food and prizes.
 “This year would have marked the 16th consecutive year of the outing and we can not be more thankful to all the sponsors, golfers and volunteers that have made this golf outing a success over the past 15 years. Thank you. We have no doubt that we will have many more future years of success.”

Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James said Saturday that he won't wear a social justice message on the back of his jersey when the NBA season resumes.
 James explained why he passed when he spoke with reporters on a video conference call Saturday.
 "I don't need to have something on the back of my jersey for people to understand my mission or know what I'm about and what I'm here to do," James said.
 The Lakers are slated to open the restarted season on July 30 against the Los Angeles Clippers at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando, Fla.
 The NBA is allowing players to sport a message on the back of their jerseys instead of their last name. James scanned the list of approved phrases but didn't see one that appealed to him.
 "It was no disrespect to the list that was handed out to all the players," James said. "I commend anyone that decides to put something on the back of their jersey. It's just something that didn't really seriously resonate with my mission, with my goal.
 "I would have loved to have a say-so on what would have went on the back of my jersey. I had a couple things in mind, but I wasn't part of that process, which is OK. I'm absolutely OK with that."
 Among the phrases reportedly agreed upon by the NBA and the NBA Players association include: Black Lives Matter; Say Their Names; I Can't Breathe; and Respect Us.
 In fact, Lakers center JaVale McGee chose "Respect Us" for the back of his jersey.
 "I definitely feel like respect is a key factor in social injustices," McGee told reporters on Saturday. "I feel like we definitely need to get equality. We definitely need to get the same respect everybody else does."
 Saturday also marked the Lakers' first group practice for the preparation of the upcoming restart. It came four months to the day since the NBA season was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 "It gave me an opportunity to be home and make up a lot of time that I've lost over the years because I've been playing in this league and striving to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, to ever play this game," said James, a 16-time All-Star averaging 25.7 points, 10.6 assists and 7.9 rebounds this season. "So sacrificing my family at times was the most challenging and hardest part of it all."
 The Lakers (49-14) hold a 5 1/2-game lead over the Clippers for the top seed in the Western Conference.

They make the sport look easy. But when it’s all in the family, it’s like second nature.
 “You learn the fundamentals, and once you get up, it’s like riding a bike,” Abbie said while taking a break in Saturday’s South Carolina state championships at Emerald Lake Water Ski Club.
 Their brother, Noah, even skis. But these days, his focus is on baseball after signing with USC Lancaster to play that sport.
 But the Skeens’ water-skiing frenzy began with Mark, who began his passion while growing up in Central North Carolina. He garnered multiple state championships en route to helping found the water-skiing program at UNC Charlotte.
 Mark agreed the learning is the hardest part.
 “It’s probably the initial learning. But once you dedicate yourself to it and spend some time in the water, most people pick it up,” said Mark, whose wife, Katie, also skis. “We lived in North Carolina until we moved down here in 2010. So the kids grew up on the water.”
 On this day, Emerald Lake, Mark and Ella also competed in slalom. Abbie, in addition to the slalom, competed in the trick-ski discipline.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have won Louisiana’s twice-postponed presidential primary.
 Trump faced no true challenger for the Republican nomination, but four other GOP contenders ran against him on Louisiana’s ballot Saturday.
 Biden faced 13 other Democrats on the ballot, though he already had locked up enough delegates in other states to become the party’s nominee.
 Louisiana had one of the nation’s last presidential primaries. It was delayed twice from its original April 4 date because of the coronavirus pandemic and was pushed back so many months that it became irrelevant to the selection the party nominees.
 Voters had extra days of early voting and expanded mail-in balloting options because of the virus outbreak.

While the coronavirus pandemic has forced shows to halt production, the _Property Brothers_ have found ways to keep their HGTV franchise going. The twins, Drew Scott and Jonathan Scott, have outlined their plans for the future in a new _Variety_ interview, revealing that most of _Brother vs. Brother_ Season 7 is filmed. They have also begun casting on _Property Brothers: Forever Home_ in Los Angeles, and will only feature six families instead of 20.
 Although most Hollywood productions were shut down due to the pandemic, Jonathan told _Variety_ that construction never was. "It was considered essential for obvious reasons because we can't have people displaced from their homes," he explained. "But really, it was a challenge for us. Do we pause the shows and leave these houses as they are, or do we try and get these families back into their homes?"
 Casting for _Forever Home_ began online, but the rest of the early process was normal. Their producers and crew obviously could not physically tour homes, so they used illustration software to create new design plans. Drew said the brothers could not "go back" to the "busier pace" they were used to when prepping the show. They also spent more time finding reasonable projects to take on during the pandemic while following social distancing guidelines.
 "We're trying to find projects that we can take on that aren't so over the top or so massive that it's not realistic," Drew explained to _Variety_. "Some of the renovation projects are going to focus on smaller areas in the home, but to be really impactful in those areas and to make sure our timelines can be fast." Some of the homeowners who agree to participate are likely allowing people to come into their homes for the first time since March, so the Scotts will be traveling with small crews, installing hand-washing stations, and performing temperature checks.
 One big challenge is that some people who have the coronavirus may be asymptomatic. Jonathan noted it is hard to tell the difference between someone having allergies and the virus, so they are taking "extra precautions" to make sure no one showing symptoms is allowed to work on the show. "We will also have people re-sign affidavits every morning, to make sure that they haven't attended large group gatherings, that they haven't done things that expose risk," Jonathan said.

 Group scenes will be filmed outdoors and everyone will be staying a safe distance apart. That means the brothers will stand far from the families. The brothers are also fascinated by how the pandemic has changed what people want to do in their homes. Drew told _Variety_ some families have asked if they can design separate living rooms for children and adults. Others have asked for "storage solutions" and about home offices more often than usual.
 The Scotts said they are producing more episodes voluntarily. HGTV did not force them to do so. They have months of episodes for their other shows already produced and their production company is editing remotely. Although the Scotts' retail business has been hurt by the virus, they wanted to make sure their production company employees were working. They employ 80 full-time staffers for their projects. "One of the priorities for us was to try and keep everybody employed," Jonathan said.
