“It was really, really cool. I didn’t know what to expect going in,” Farris said of the two-hour Zoom call. “We got to ask (Brooks) questions about being in media relations and working in the NFL, kind of how he got there.”
 And building relationships is right in Farris’ wheelhouse.
 “I enjoy when I can sit down and can have a conversation with a player or a coach and make those connections,” she said. “I’m definitely a connection person.”
 Farris knows she has a long way to go to reach her dream. But she’s already come a long way from her backyard on the farm.
 “The end of middle school and high school came along,” Farris said, “and I started getting more interested in football, actually knowing what’s going on. When I got (to Bemidji), that’s when everything blew up.”

Bayern Munich extended their league winning streak and moved level on points with leaders Borussia Dortmund after a 5-1 thrashing of Borussia Monchengladbach. Two goals in the first 11 minutes from Javi Martinez and Thomas Muller put Bayern firmly in the driving seat as they held off a Monchengladbach challenge at the end of the first half to lead 2-0 at the break. Home captain Lars Stindl pulled one back before the Bavarians took full control with goals from Robert Lewandowski and Serge…

Leal, who is South's all-time boys' scoring leader (1,620 points) was working his tail off long before that trip to the Hall of Fame. His mom, Sherry, has piled up the scrapbook material watching Anthony and his older sister Lauren (who now plays at DePauw) turn themselves into successful athletes and students.
 "We've got videos and boxes and boxes of pictures," Sherry said. "It's been a journey and it's been a lot of fun for our family and kids."
 And the journey will move to the next level as Anthony has matured mentally and physically into the type of player who is ready to head into the frying pan that is the Big Ten.
 "He's put in a consistent four-years of work," said Jordan Bayse, coach with Leal's Indiana Elite club program during that time. "He's always adding to his game. When he was young, he was more of a slasher, and he learned to be a shooter. Shooting off the dribble is something he's added more recently.
 "He doesn't get comfortable. And he's super competitive. He's a perfectionist, but he's always been coachable. And he knows when to turn it off, which has always kept him fresh."
 Leal is buoyed even more by what Hulls was able to go on and do at IU, using it as motivation to push himself to accomplish similar things.
 "I definitely learned a lot from him, as far as being humble and prioritizing team, which not everyone is willing to do," Leal said.
 "I hope he keeps working and not forget what got him to this point," Hulls said. "And that carries over to the next level. It's a whole different level of speed and physicality, things he'll learn pretty quick. He has a good head on his shoulders. He's a smart kid, so he should be able to figure things out. He's got good size and a good body and if he can provide some outside shooting, that can help in a lot of different ways."
 Anthony's father, Martin, arrived at IU as a student from East Chicago just in time to see the last men's NCAA banner hung in 1994. And he likes the intangibles and team-first attitude his son and the other incoming IU freshmen will bring to the table for coach Archie Miller.
 That said, it is still a bit surreal for Martin and Sherry to know that their son will soon be taking the court at Assembly Hall.
 "I know the first time he was there on his official visit, when he came out in the candy stripes for his picture, I had tears in my eyes," Sherry said. "He's living the dream that so many Indiana boys and Bloomington boys have dreamed about for sure."
 Martin now works with the IU Foundation, so his Hoosier pride runs deep. He figures the tears will come for him, too.
 "I'm waiting for that first time he's on the floor," Martin said. "I consider that'll be Hoosier Hysteria this fall. It'll take on a different meaning. That's where it'll probably hit me and I'll get emotional, to actually see him go out there for the first time."
 It's also surreal for their son to realize that, just as he looked up to players like Hulls, so too are youngsters looking at him the same way.
 Once inspired, he is now the inspiration. And it will be on display at a museum in New Castle.
 "My dad (J.C.) trained him when he was younger, so I've followed his career even though I've been away for most of it," Hulls said. "But I've communicated with him by text and encouraged him and to see that hard work pay off is special.
 "And for us to be from Bloomington and the same school and then part of the same university, it's pretty special."

"Video games are not only about fun and entertainment but could also serve as a means to enhance learning skills, scientific research, and creative solutions. Our mission as a school is to lead our students into the creation of a product that might be innovative, immersive, and meaningful. In this difficult moment, all over the world people are facing a threat, that is still unknown and affects our social behaviours. We unite with all players thanks to #PlayApartTogether campaign, and encourage people of all ages to play games online, respecting the rules and suggestions given by WHO and our Governments in order to fight Covid-19 diffusion. It is fundamental that each one of us stays at home and follow the rules but it is also important that we take care of our relationships. Video games communities and online games are such a helpful resource, being both a link with people and a social distancing way to stay together."

The Minneapolis City Council voted Friday to approve the settlement. Johnson accused two police officers of violating his civil rights by using a stun gun and a chemical spray on him outside the Seven Restaurant in October 2014. He was found not guilty in June 2015 in Hennepin County court on misdemeanor charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct.
 “I feel good about it,” Johnson, who played for the Vikings from 2011-18, said Friday. “The officers and the city actually had to be accountable for something that went on at the end of the day that was very unprofessional.”
 Johnson played in the NFL from 2011-18, also spending time New Orleans from 2011-13 and Seattle in 2018. He said he is officially retired, and now works in real estate in New Orleans and Houston.
 “The road to justice is a long one,” said Johnson’s attorney, Eric Hageman. “They fought us every step of the way. We were heading to trial this summer when they settled. We got it done, and Tom got the vindication he was looking for and he was able to hold them accountable.”
