“President Mahama while campaigning at Lawra in the Upper West Region, said the NPP will not allow Dr. Bawumia to be their flagbearer because the party is largely not in support of northerners taking up such positions” (cityfmonline.com/ghanaweb.com, 21/11/2016).

Dearest reader, isn’t it extremely disappointing that no less a person than Ex-President Mahama would keep uttering distasteful epithets and pronouncements to the annoyance of many Ghanaians?


--DocBreak--
But unbeknownst to many Ghanaians, former President Mahama can be pugnacious. Thus I find it really difficult to understand why he has been given the appellations: ‘Humble, respectful, peacemaker amongst others. To be quite honest, I do not think President Mahama deserves those descriptive nicknames.


--DocBreak--
“Gonjas go with whoever comes with policies and programmes that aim to deliver us from the shackles of Ghana’s most insidious enemy: poverty!!!”; and that is why with His Excellency John Mahama (a Gonja) as the candidate and leader of the NDC in the 2016 elections, you (President Akufo-Addo) garnered a significant 20% of the votes cast in John Mahama’s Bole backyard”; Dr Adam said.


--DocBreak--
Former President Mahama pontificated somewhat carelessly: “Sometimes I feel sad when I see some of our northern brothers running and also doing this. They will use you and dump you. Let anything happen today and let our brother Bawumia say he is standing for president in NPP. They will never give it to him I can assure you”.


--DocBreak--
I am afraid, that was uncharacteristic of a leader who had been tagged as humble, respectful, God fearing etc.


--DocBreak--
Well, the preceding assertion may seem frivolous to many of his apologists. However, President Mahama’s seemingly condescending comments on Alhaji Dr Mahmoud Bawumia during the 2016 electioneering campaign really exposed his hypocrisy.


--DocBreak--
As a matter of fact, it was uncharacteristic on the part of a supposedly humble President to impugn that all Ashantis are unappreciative.


--DocBreak--
He said until some weeks ago, Bole was effectively acephalous and the institution of chieftaincy in Bole remained a poisoned chalice because of the President Akufo-Addo’s clandestine political machinations.


--DocBreak--
AshantiGold SC played in the Confederation Cup last year as a result of their triumph in the NC Tier Two competition.


--DocBreak--
I recall in one of his then ‘changing lives’ speeches, President Mahama sarcastically suggested that Bawumia had not been a president before and therefore cannot impugn incompetence on his government.


--DocBreak--
I recall Ex-President Mahama went to Kumasi and labelled the entire people of Ashanti region as ungrateful lots. He referred to Ashantis as ungrateful lots who would never even be content with gold plated roads. How bizarre?


--DocBreak--
Obviously, such thought process was extremely dangerous and undemocratic and should not have come from the lips of a supposedly humble president.


--DocBreak--
Former President Mahama, I am afraid, has been creating a niche of sarcasm for himself over the years.


--DocBreak--
In fact, former President Mahama, more often than not, fails to anticipate the dire consequences of his unmeasured pronouncements.


--DocBreak--
Former President Mahama, to be quite honest, has an innate predilection for abusing those who show divergent views to his.


--DocBreak--
Dr Sheriff Adam said the silence of President Akufo-Addo over the tagging of Gonjas as “mafias” was rather deafening.


--DocBreak--
Dr Adam Sheriff also explained that Gonjas are so politically open-minded that they allowed President Akufo-Addo to effectively “infiltrate our camp in Bole to plant the seeds of dissent and division in our highly venerated chieftaincy institution”.


--DocBreak--
In other words, Ex-President Mahama was implying that Ashantis cannot pronounce words that have letters L&R.; That was not funny by any stretch of the imagination.


--DocBreak--
I recollect in one of the Parliamentary sittings, former President Mahama had an impertinent boldness to insult Ashantis indiscriminately. He openly said: “People of the Ashanti origin have problem with letters L&R;”.


--DocBreak--
Let us however remind ourselves that we (Ghanaians) have been taught to respect the dead. So I was extremely dumbfounded when after the death of Professor Mills, I heard former President Mahama impoliticly suggesting: “God in his own wisdom has taken the old man, Professor Mills away to pave the way for youthful Mahama to take over the mantle”. How pathetic?


--DocBreak--
“We are so politically open-minded that you will find that the most vociferous critics of John Mahama are not just Gonjas, but Gonjas from Bole. Like many other tribes in Ghana, we are so politically open-minded that you will find that our political loyalties are embedded within all major political parties in Ghana.


--DocBreak--
Mr Mahama was reported to have poured his heart out: “We are not going to joke in 2020, and I’m sounding a warning to the NPP – we are going to match them boot for boot. “I want to sound a caution that NDC has a revolutionary root and when it comes to unleashing violence, no one can beat us to that.”


--DocBreak--
Take, for example, in one of his countless press conferences during his time in office, Ex-President Mahama went ahead frolicking by giving needless descriptive nickname to the then acting chairman of the NPP, Freddie Blay.


--DocBreak--
I recall during the 2016 electioneering campaign, A number of prominent Ghanaians and civil society groups, including the then Chairman of Peace Council, Professor Emmanuel Asante and the Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA) beseeched Ex-President John Dramani Mahama to refrain from making comments deemed ethnocentric against the NPP and its running mate, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia.


--DocBreak--
I remember somewhere last year, Ex-President Mahama featured in the news, albeit for wrong reasons following his unsavoury comment on the unfortunate incident which occurred during the Ayawaso West Wuogon by-election on Thursday 31st January 2019.


--DocBreak--
The miners who represented Ghana in the same competition in the 2019/2020 season have been given the chance to compete again, following the cancellation of the 2019/2020 domestic football season.


--DocBreak--
Shockingly, Ex-President Mahama sarcastically referred to the gentleman as ‘OPANA’, (literally means ‘trouble maker’).


--DocBreak--
“Like Madam Elizabeth Ohene in her recent remonstrations of Civil Society Organizations, I put it to you that you were silent then because the shoe was on the other foot. And that is where the inconsistency and double standards lie”; Dr Adam said.


--DocBreak--
Another caller added: “The same weed I was imprisoned for, was very easy to come about in the prison.”


--DocBreak--
Deductively, according to former President Mahama, the rest of Ghanaians did not have the right to criticise him and his government because we have not sat on the presidential seat before.


--DocBreak--
He unkindly told them: “BALONEY”. In other words, Ex-President Mahama was implying that the Parliamentarians were engaging in “foolish discourse”. How bizarre? Humble indeed!


--DocBreak--
You may agree to disagree, but it would appear that former President Mahama’s desperation to return to power is really getting out of hands.


--DocBreak--
Subsequent to that infamous declaration, Ex-President Mahama went to the Northern Region and opined somewhat weirdly that it was about time ‘Northerners’ took over the mantle of Presidency, because they (Northerners) are fed up serving in the Vice Presidency post.


--DocBreak--
In sum, for the sake of peace and security, Ex-President Mahama should, as a matter of urgency, cease the distasteful pronouncements.


--DocBreak--
I also remember when the Attorney General’s office charged Kennedy Agyapong with Treason, Terrorism & genocide and former President Kufuor humbly appealed for calm, and further suggested that we should avoid ‘killing a fly with a Sledge Hammer. Ex-President Mahama replied hastily and lividly: “We will rather kill a fly with a Bulldozer”.

--DocBreak--
Again, in the wake of the public discourse on the suitability of the proposed burial place of our departed president Mills, Ex-President Mahama condescendingly stated that Ghanaians who took part in the debate both on radio, television and even in their private homes and work places engaged in a “USELESS” discourse.


--DocBreak--
Honestly speaking, that cheeky remark can only come from the lips of a bellicose, but it should not have come from the lips of a supposedly submissive and peaceful President. With all due respect, Ex-President Mahama can be very careless in his pronouncements at times.


--DocBreak--
That was indeed an irrevocable cheek from a supposedly submissive leader! Do Ghanaians call such an individual as humble and respectful?


--DocBreak--
Dr Adam said even though the President knew the tag of “Gonja Mafias” was popularized in NPP quarters over which he presided even though there was no “tightly knit group” of Gonjas (or a “mafia”) around former President John Dramani Mahama.


--DocBreak--
According to the UK based Bole man Gonjas were tagged as “mafias” during President John Mahama’s time and that he knows President Akufo-Addo was fully aware that unlike many other tribes in Ghana that can be argued to largely affiliate with a political party, Gonjas generally do not have strong loyalties to any party in Ghana.


--DocBreak--
Listen to the Article
 I must admit, I was not in the least surprised when I recently read that former President Mahama has chosen to endorse an obvious ethnocentric epistle by the MP for Bolgatanga Central, Isaac Adongo.


--DocBreak--
Strangely, however, former President Mahama went ahead and asserted that only our two former Presidents, Kufuor and Rawlings have the pedigree and therefore may criticise him.


--DocBreak--
I recall during a debate on the STX Housing deal, former President Mahama, the then Vice President, abused our Members of parliament who opposed the deal.
