From my perspective, AI should be a major subject in schools. After all, the world our children are inheriting is suffused with it. If they are to master the technology, rather than serve it, we must prepare them. In reality, AI is entering schools primarily as a teaching tool (but also for surveillance). However, I've found that searching for programs that actually teach kids about AI is more challenging.

DECATUR, Ala. (WAFF) - New documents from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development are making some startling accusations against the Decatur Housing Authority. Our news partners at the Decatur Daily obtained a compliance review from the federal agency which charged DHA with discriminating against Blacks who were on waiting lists for homes at Jordan- Neill and Summer Manor apartments along the Tennessee River. Instead, the HUD memo suggests those applicants were steered towards Westgate Gardens on the city’s northwest side.“According to the tenant roster that was provided to the compliance review team, 100% of the units in Westgate Gardens are occupied by black tenants,” according to the document signed by HUD Region IV Director Carlos Osegueda. “In comparison, the tenant roster for The Towers indicated that 94% of the units are occupied by white tenants.”Jordan-Neill apartments, one of two riverfront Decatur Housing Authority properties for low-income elderly residents next to Rhodes Ferry Park. A US Dept. of Housing and Urban Development study found it has an almost exclusively white population, while Black applicants were sent to other locations.During the compliance review period it analyzed, according to the letter, HUD found 15 instances “where white applicants were offered and/or placed in units at The Towers before black applicants even though the black applicants were on the waiting list for a longer period of time. … The evidence revealed that black applicants were repeatedly skipped over when units became available at The Towers.” One Black applicant “remained on the waiting list for a unit at The Towers for 1,948 days, and still was not offered a unit,” according to HUD.HUD’s investigation found significant differences between Westgate Gardens and Summer Manor and Jordan-Neill. That includes access to things like walking trails, waterfront views, libraries, community kitchens, pianos and outdoor patios along with social activities. “The tenants at Westgate Gardens do not have similar or comparable amenities like those found at The Towers,” according to HUD. “Additionally, none of the social activities that are provided to tenants in The Towers are offered to tenants at Westgate Gardens.” The memo also noted instances of Westgate tenants being charged maintenance fees that Towers residents were not.Decatur Housing Authority settled those claims for $200,000, which went to many of the victims of the alleged discrimination last week. It also agreed to upgrades at Westgate Gardens estimated to be worth about one million dollars.Decatur Housing Authority Executive Director Andy Holloway and Housing Director Jeff Snead did not return numerous messages from The Daily last week. The authority’s treasurer, Donna Gibson, declined comment Friday.You can read more about this incident, and see reaction from people living in the facilities at DecaturDaily.com Copyright 2020 WAFF.

"I am highly likely to sign with a WSL club and I am really excited about it," Fishlock said. "My main priority now is being at home with my family."
 Fishlock spent 13 months sidelined by a serious knee injury she suffered in June 2019.
 She returned to play for Reign in the NWSL Challenge Cup, but with the season shortened drastically in the USA, Fishlock is now looking to gain full match fitness with her rehab disrupted by Covid-19 restrictions.
 "I'm probably at the same point with my knee with regards to returning to play as I was in February," she told BBC Sport Wales.
 "There hasn't been enough consistent training or playing matches for me to be able to say 'I'm okay'. That's the reality.
 "It will need four or five games until I can say 'no worries'. I've played 70 minutes since February when I was fit again. It's been hard."
 Fishlock, who has made 113 appearances for Wales, has returned to Cardiff from Seattle and is excited about the opportunity to play domestically for the first time since spells with Bristol in 2012 and Glasgow in 2013.
 Fishlock joined OL Reign, then Seattle Reign, in 2013 and has played on loan in France, Germany and Australia, but has never returned to the WSL.
 She says a desire to play in Wales' rearranged Euro 2021 qualifiers means she must resume playing as soon a possible.
 Jayne Ludlow's side Wales play Norway away on 22 September in Oslo's Ullevaal Stadion, before hosting the Faroe Islands on 22 October and then Norway five days later. They will also be at home on 1 December when Wales face Belarus in the their final qualifier.
 The WSL season gets under way on Saturday, 5 September.
 "The Challenge Cup was huge for the NWSL and it will propel us... but the players in the NWSL are going to need to play games right now," she added.
 "For me especially, with the qualifiers that we have, I have to play right now, so I am home and I am looking for a short-term loan.
 "I have to play, I haven't played in 13 months and we have qualifiers in six weeks.
 "If I don't play now I can't play in those qualifiers and then by the time we come back in the US I'd have been out for 18 months and I don't know who comes back from that.
 "The WSL is going to have a really competitive season I think."

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called on European Union’s leaders to convene an extraordinary summit to discuss Belarus, saying that the 27-member bloc should support the democratic aspirations of people in Belarus.
 Several world leaders, in the meantime, congratulated Lukashenko on his win. Chinese leader Xi Jinping was the first among them, saying that “Belarus will certainly achieve new brilliant successes in state-building.” He was followed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, the president of Kazakhstan, Kassym- Jomart Tokayev, and the leader of Azerbaijan, Ilkham Aliyev.
 The election results “indicate the popular support” for Lukashenko's rule, Tokayev said.
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Facebook post Monday it was “obvious that not everyone in the country agrees with the announced preliminary election results. And, as we know, any legitimacy arises solely from public trust." He urged the government of Belarus to refrain from violence and called for dialogue with the opposition.
 Two prominent opposition challengers were denied places on the ballot, but Tsikhanouskaya, the wife of a jailed opposition blogger, managed to unite opposition groups and draw tens of thousands to her campaign rallies, tapping growing anger over a stagnant economy and fatigue with Lukashenko’s autocratic rule.
 Lukashenko was defiant as he voted earlier in the day, warning that the opposition will meet a tough response.
 “If you provoke, you will get the same answer,” he said. “Do you want to try to overthrow the government, break something, wound, offend, and expect me or someone to kneel in front of you and kiss them and the sand onto which you wandered? This will not happen.”
 The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose assessments of elections are widely regarded as authoritative, was not invited to send observers.
 Tsikhanouskaya had crisscrossed the country, tapping into public frustration with a worsening economy and Lukashenko’s swaggering response to the pandemic.
 Belarus, a country of 9.5 million people, has reported more than 68,500 coronavirus cases and 580 deaths but critics have accused authorities of manipulating the figures to downplay the death toll.
 Belarus has sustained a severe economic blow after its leading exports customer, Russia, went into a pandemic-induced recession and other foreign markets shrank. Before the coronavirus, the country’s state-controlled economy already had been stalled for years, stoking public frustration.
 Lukashenko has dismissed the virus as “psychosis” and declined to apply measures to stop its spread, saying a lockdown would have doomed the already weak economy. He announced last month that he had been infected but had no symptoms and recovered quickly, allegedly thanks to playing sports.

In-person on-farm learning opportunities have been few and far between this summer due to the global coronavirus pandemic.
 But even in the midst of a pandemic, farmers are interested in seeing what other farmers are doing, and maybe picking up some tips along the way.
 So instead of an Aug. 1 field day that had been planned since they were named 2020 Organic Farmers of the Year by the Midwest Organic & Sustainable Education Service, Jane Hawley Stevens and her husband, David Stevens, moved things online for a virtual MOSES Organic Field Day in place of the in-person event.
 Jane and David have been growing organic herbs and selling wellness products from their certified organic farm, Four Elements Organic Herbals, for more than 30 years.
 They grow more than 200 varieties of herbs to make wellness products like teas, creams, tinctures, lip balms and sprays. They also harvest wild plants, including dandelion, chickweed, white pine and burdock for medicinal purposes.
 “I am just passionate about herbs,” Jane said. “As they say in the herb business, ‘to grow them is to know them.’ If I identify a health concern of mine, I’ll look up a plant. If I don’t have it, I’ll order the seeds and take it through the growing season and make something out of it at the end of the season. That’s how I get to know my plants.
 “I love to have that intimate relationship with my plants.”
 Jane started her career by growing and selling potted herbs. She first started experimenting with herbal remedies when she treated her son’s recurring ear infections using a tincture of mullein flowers and olive oil as an alternative to prescription drugs.
 “It’s been amazing my whole career and horticulture life to see how plants are here to support us, from simple recipes to things that are more complex,” Jane said. “It’s amazing when I step into the garden to create something to help us maintain our wellness how effective it is.”
 Jane said she makes it clear to customers she doesn’t claim to diagnose, treat or cure disease with the herbs, but “I just love to teach about them,” she said.
 “The herbs are steeped in folklore and tradition,” she said. “With so much available science, it’s amazing that we can rely on all these sources of information to find out how these plants can be used.”
 Both Jane and David have degrees in horticulture. The couple met in Texas and moved to Wisconsin when David decided to pursue a master’s degree at UW- Madison.
 “It was really growing plants that brought us together,” said David, who works full-time off the farm at the University of Wisconsin Arboretum.
 When Jane found the 130-acre farm farm that would become Four Elements Organic Herbals, the property hadn’t been farmed in about 20 years, giving them a bit of a blank slate as young farmers just getting started, David said. There were farm buildings that needed repair and they built a commercial kitchen and, over time, they added a pole shed and greenhouse that David found, moved and reassembled piece by piece on the farm, he said.
 “At the beginning, we had a lot more energy than money, as a lot of folks do,” he said.
 The 130-acre farm, which was certified organic in 1990, is just outside of North Freedom, about an hour northwest of Madison in the Baraboo Bluffs. About half of the farm is in fields and about half is woods, David said.
 The Baraboo Bluffs contain the largest surface deposit of quartzite granite in the Midwest, making for some “unique farming obstacles,” David said.
 To work around boulders, many of the fields on the farm are divided into smaller growing areas.
 “It gave us a more ornate design, but it’s really out of function and not form,” David said.
 The couple started small with Four Elements Organic Herbals. The first teas they sold had hand-written labels and calligraphy on the labels done by David.
 “What we discovered many years ago is we loved growing plants, but it was tough to make a living just selling the raw herb,” David said. “We discovered that value-added, making products with the herbs we grew, was a lot more sustainable. We had products we could sell 12 months out of the year instead of just during the growing season.”
 The couple works hard to keep the farm sustainable. They use solar panels to help power the shed used to dry herbs, and Jane said they grow almost all of their food and preserve about 600 cans of food items each year.
 They also raise pastured poultry and beef cattle and make maple syrup.
 “We like to live with the land, not on the land,” Jane said. “To be a sustainable farm, you have to wear lots of hats.”
 They are on a three-year rotation with their annual crops and they usually get about three years out of perennials before weed pressure forces a move. They use cover crops to improve soil health between rotations.
 “What I do not like to do is leave any open areas for long,” David said.
 For more than 20 years, the couple has worked with the community to bring in leaves that have been raked from area yards that they then use as mulch on many fields of annuals and perennial crops.
 “It’s a great way to work with our community and feed our soil at no extra cost to us,” David said.
 This year, David is evaluating several vegetables for the Seed to Kitchen Collaborative, a program run by Julie Dawson of the UW-Madison Department of Horticulture that connects organic plant breeders to Wisconsin farmers and chefs.
 “It’s a pretty cool concept,” David said. “It’s an opportunity to focus on vegetable variety characteristics important to local food systems such as flavor, fresh-market quality and agronomic performance on smaller-scale farms.”
 The couple is planning an on-farm MOSES field day for next year.
 Four Elements Organic Herbals products are in their apothecary in North Freedom, about eight miles north of the farm, and through the farm's website, www.fourelementsherbals.com.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The visit by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to Taiwan comes against the backdrop of tensions between Washington and the island's rival China over issues from the South China Sea to TikTok. Azar is the highest-level U.S. official to visit the self-governing island democracy since formal diplomatic relations were severed in 1979 in deference to China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary. The visit has brought protests from Beijing, but Taiwan is just one in a long list of issues involving politics, trade and culture that have China and the U.S. at loggerheads just months ahead of the American presidential election.

Portugal is taking center stage for soccer during the next two weeks — a country where rivalries between clubs go well beyond the field of play.
 The decisive stages of the Champions League will begin on Wednesday in the southern European nation where back-and-forth accusations and legal actions involving the country’s top teams are routine.
 Club officials are not afraid of attacking each other publicly. The government is often probing teams for alleged wrongdoing. Not even players and their agents are free from controversy.
 It wasn’t long ago that search-and-seizure operations took place simultaneously at the headquarters of Benfica, Porto and Sporting Lisbon, the country’s three biggest clubs. It happened just before the coronavirus pandemic struck, as authorities investigated possible tax fraud and irregularities in soccer in an operation called “Offside.”
 Presidents of all three clubs have been accused of some sort of wrongdoing over the past years, though they have always claimed innocence and actual convictions have been rare.
 Benfica, a two-time European champion in the 1960s and Portugal’s most successful club with 37 league titles, has been targeted in more than a handful of cases in the last five years. Trading of its shares was temporarily suspended last month after the latest accusations were made against the club over alleged tax fraud.

Così come hanno avuto il coraggio di prendersi un bonus di 600 euro guadagnando uno stipendio di 13mila euro netti al mese, adesso abbiano il coraggio di uscire allo scoperto. Abbiano il coraggio di mostrarsi agli italiani. Sono pronto ad aderire all’idea lanciata da Vito Crimi sulla rinuncia alla privacy così da autorizzare l’INPS a pubblicare i nomi. Facciano lo stesso tutti i parlamentari di ogni forza politica.

Caris LeVert guard/forward told reporters that Toronto moves the ball well and is a "great defensive team."
 "But for us, we feel like it's about us," LeVert said. "If we move the ball well, if we play good defence, if we're locked into the game plan, we can win that series. We truly believe that. So we're going to go into that playoff matchup all the way locked in."
 While there is no traditional home-court advantage in the NBA bubble at Walt Disney World, Raptors coach Nick Nurse said recently that he wasn't writing it off entirely. The league has been tinkering with game presentation, Nurse said.
 It includes 300 of the team's fans appearing digitally on courtside video screens and manufactured crowd noise piped into the arena. During scrimmages in the Walt Disney World bubble, it had been so quiet Nurse said the opposing teams could hear him calling plays.
 "There's crowd noise (now), you can see family members and coaches' family members and players' family members (on the giant video screens), there is a sense of personal touch to it," Nurse said. "It seems like they're tweaking a little bit more and more as they go here in the games, as they're learning things about how to put the game on in this setting," Nurse said.
 "We're seeing familiar faces on those screens, and who knows what it'll evolve to here two months from now. So I don't want to discount the home court thing quite yet."
 The Raptors' playoff series against the Nets was their first post-season appearance in six years. Brooklyn won Game 7 104-103 Toronto when Paul Pierce blocked Kyle Lowry's shot as time expired.

The pair had been paddleboarding off Budleigh Salterton with their dog when they were blown offshore at about 5.20pm.
 They managed to call the coastguard with a mobile phone in a waterproof bag, and the lifeboat arrived within 10 minutes. The paddeboarders and the dog were taken back to Budleigh Salterton beach.
 On the way back to base the lifeboat crew were alerted to a number of kayakers and paddleboarders struggling in a strong offshore wind off of Sidmouth Beach.
 The lifeboat crew diverted to them and spoke to some of the paddleboarders and a kayaker, who said they would make their own way back to shore, but were grateful for the lifeboat crew watching over them as they did so. The lifeboat stayed with them for 45 minutes until they were all safe.
 Earlier that day, Sidmouth Lifeboat went to the aid of a broken-down motorboat with two people on board, a mile south of Sidmouth beach.
 The crew were alerted at around 9.20am that morning.
 The pair managed to restart their motorboat as the lifeboat was on its way, and the crew made sure they reached the shore safely.
 The three incidents came during the UK’s busiest day for more than four years for HM Coastguard.
 Across the UK as a whole there were 340 incidents.
 A Sidmouth lifeboat spokesman said: “Sidmouth Beach often experiences strong offshore winds.
 “As we head into another period of good weather, we understand people want to enjoy the sunshine, the beach and the coast, but urge everyone to take extra precautions to ensure their own safety and the safety of others.”
 People are being reminded not to swim near or between the rock islands; not to use inflatables, and not to ‘tombstone’.
 The advice is to check and double-check the weather forecast and tide times, and obey local hazard signs.
 Anyone going out to sea should wear a lifejacket and take a mobile phone or radio with them, as well as telling someone where they are going and what time they expect to be back.

SAN LUIS, Ariz. – COVID-19 may have put a damper on public celebrations, but next month marks a milestone of no less significance for the Comite de Bien Estar, an organization that has been a bedrock of this city’s growth.
 In September 1980, Comite incorporated as a housing cooperative that helped its members – individuals as families of limited means, many of them recently immigrated from Mexico – to attain home ownership. Pooling the funds of its members, the non-profit organization purchased and subdivided land where they then built their homes.
 The 40th anniversary would have been an apt occasion for a celebration of the history of what today is one of the city’s two largest residential developers. But the need for social distancing amid the pandemic forced Comite to tone down any celebrations, said its executive director, Tony Reyes.

Deputy Prime Minister Raluca Turcan said on Monday that August 10, 2018 represents an "unhealed wound of the recent Romanian democracy," showing that she is waiting for justice to clarify things in the case.
 "August 10, 2018 is an unhealed wound of recent Romanian democracy. After the miners' riots [in 1990 and 1991] , I did not think I would see violently repressed protests in Romania, but the Social Democratic Party (PSD) has managed to turn us back in time, behaving as it knows best: abusively and manipulatively, from the position of someone who should not be contracted. Romanians must not forget what the toxic PSD government means. Justice has shown in time that the place of the PSD leader with dictatorial leanings is behind bars. I expect justice to clarify things in the August 10 case and to send the culprits where they belong. That is exactly why the National Liberal Party (PNL) has declassified the August 10 report and offered all its support for investigating the facts that those in Victoriei Square have not forgotten," Turcan wrote on Monday on Facebook.
