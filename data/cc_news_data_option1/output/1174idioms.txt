The American Veterinary Medical Association notes the risk of picking up the virus from your pet is low. “Smooth (non-porous) surfaces (e.g., countertops, door knobs) transmit viruses better than porous materials (e.g., paper money, pet fur) because porous, especially fibrous, materials absorb and trap the pathogen (virus), making it harder to contract through simple touch.”
 If you become sick, or suspect you’ve been infected, limit physical contact with your pet. Have someone else provide for your pet’s care if possible. Avoid letting your pet lick you, and don’t hug, kiss or share food. Wear a mask when interacting with them and wash your hands before and after handling your pet, their food and toys.
 If you’re healthy but stuck at home due to layoffs and social distancing mandates, you can enjoy time with your pet as normal. We’re lucky to live in a rural setting where we can enjoy the outdoors with our dogs while maintaining social distance. Take a stroll through campus now that finals are done (no people around).

ATLANTA - Gov. Brian Kemp issued an executive order Monday, March 23, requiring Georgians at high risk of contracting coronavirus to stay at home.


  The order, which took effect at noon Tuesday, March 24, and runs until noon April 6, also will close all bars and nightclubs in Georgia and prohibit gatherings of 10 or more unless the participants remain at least six feet apart.


  The state Department of Public Health will be authorized to close any businesses that aren’t complying with the order.


  “These measures are intended to ensure the health and safety of Georgians from across our state,” Kemp said during a late-afternoon briefing streamed from his office at the state Capitol. “I ask for everyone’s cooperation over the next two weeks.”


  The governor’s order came as the number of cases of COVID-19 rose to 772 in 67 Georgia counties and the number of deaths climbed to 25.


  Kemp specified that the groups of Georgians considered at risk of contracting coronavirus include residents of long-term care facilities, patients with chronic lung disease or undergoing cancer treatment, those who have tested positive for the virus, have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with coronavirus.


  Kemp also announced he has joined 21 other governors in a letter to congressional leaders asking that block grant funding to the states be included in a massive $2 trillion economic stimulus package before Congress. One of the sticking points that has been holding up an agreement between Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Senate over the aid package is whether direct funding to state and local governments should be included.


  “Governors are on the front line of this fight, and many of us are spending heavily at the end of the budget year,” Kemp said. “We desperately need these resources.”


  Kemp said part of the financial impact is in the form of soaring applications for Medicaid, PeachCare for Kids and food stamps. He said the state is working on a plan to provide extra food stamp benefits in March and April.


  Kemp provided an update on the medical equipment and supplies the state is bringing on line in the fight against coronavirus. He said 30 ventilators were sent on Monday to hospitals in Dougherty and Floyd counties, areas particularly hard hit by the virus relative to their populations.


  With capacity running short at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany, he announced plans to reopen an adjacent north wing with at least 26 rooms. Another facility in Albany with a capacity of about 60 beds also has been identified, he said.


  Kemp said the state is asking federal officials to allow the temporary facility opened at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta earlier this month to house passengers from a cruise ship to remain open after all of the passengers leave for their homes. It has about 200 beds that can be used if needed, he said.


  Also, construction has been completed on an isolation zone at the Georgia Public Safety Training Center in Forsyth with a capacity for 20 emergency housing units. The campus at the center also has room for about 200 patient beds if needed.


  The state also has opened up the pipeline to get hundreds of thousands of masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment to all 142 hospitals in Georgia for doctors, nurses and others on the front line of caring for coronavirus patients.


  Kemp said 23 COVID-19 test sites have opened across the state. Testing will be limited to elderly Georgians, members of law enforcement agencies, first responders, long-term care facility residents and staff and health-care workers.


  Kemp thanked Georgians who have heeded the warnings of state and federal health officials to stay at home if at all possible and make only essential trips. He urged Georgia citizens to remain vigilant.


  “We cannot let this virus defeat us,” he said. “We are stronger than this crisis, and we will weather the storm.”

Breathe easy - the CDC doesn't have any evidence that pets can spread COVID-19, or that people can spread it to their furry friends. But if you think you might be infected, it's best to play it safe and keep your distance until the CDC gets better answers on this one. Some organizations are urging the government to consider pet care facilities as "essential businesses," and states such as Massachusetts and Pennsylvania agree. In Texas, the jury is still out, but as with any businesses at the moment, pet care locations -- pet food stores, boarding kennels and veterinarians' offices -- should adhere to good social distancing practices.

_03/11 Update: acclaimed render artist Concept Creator has released a_ _stunningly detailed new video of the Galaxy Note 20_ _based on all the leaks so far. It shows that we can expect an evolution of the Note 10 design with a lot of influences from the Galaxy S20 line-up, including the almost bezel-less design, shrunken front camera (resulting in a smaller hole punch) and the adoption of the S20's range's massive new camera modules and rectangular hump. The only downside? The renders, in accurately portraying all the leaks so far, also show the Galaxy Note 20 without a headphone jack. That port is not coming back. Aside from this, the only question is whether any Note 20 model will sport the Galaxy S20 Ultra's huge 108MP primary camera. As it stands, a Note 20 and Note 20+ are expected but it is unknown if an Ultra model will join the ranks or Samsung will distribute the cameras differently on the Note series. Watch this space._

  Okaloosa Schools Superindent Marcus Chambers shared the following update with parents:


   


  "The week of March 23rd will be a busy week for our schools in Okaloosa County. As parents, you will receive several important notifications through email, social media, and call outs. The goal for this week is to provide our students and parents with the necessary information as we all transition into this new normal of online instruction. I will also be sending out a document and a video later this week that will provide some guidance for parents on online education.


   


  "Additionally, we will be providing approximately 17,000 devices to students and families beginning this Tuesday, March 24th. While we do not currently have enough devices to hand one out for each of the 32,000 students in our district, we have enough to ensure that all students who are in need will receive one. It is important to note that elementary students will be issued an IPad and secondary students will be issued a laptop. What does this mean for you and your child(ren)? If you currently have an IPad or a laptop, we ask that you use your device to allow our students without an IPad or laptop the ability to receive one. At this time, we are only disbursing one device per family; however, we have purchased more devices and have a plan in place to deploy second devices once we have ensured each family that needs a laptop or an IPad has received one.


   


  "You have likely seen information posted on social media from your child's school on the protocols and procedures for picking up a device. It is vital for everyone's health that you follow the guidelines each school has in place for deploying devices. Each school's procedure follows CDC guidelines for crowds and social distancing. Knowing that, please understand that picking up devices will take time, so please be prepared to wait in your car until it is your turn to receive a device. Your patience and understanding during this process is appreciated!


   


  "Since this is a new normal for everyone, I want to be transparent in this transition to online education. While we are prepared for this new model of instruction, I want all parents to know that, as with anything new, there will be bumps in this process. However, just like education in a traditional school setting, it is imperative that you work with your child's teacher and principal as they quickly work to remedy any issues you may face. Communication will be key to making this work in the best way for you and your child.


   


  "My message to our teachers and principals during this time has been to handle situations with compassion and grace. While I want our teachers and principals to work with compassion and grace in their hearts, I also ask that each of you handle your new normal with compassion and grace. Helping your children navigate the waters of this new normal might be, at times, uncomfortable. I ask that you treat yourselves, your children, and their teachers with grace and compassion. Allow mistakes. Learn from them knowing that our entire community will come out much stronger than we have ever been. I am confident that this new model will serve your children well until we can reunite back in our physical schools.


   


  "In addition to preparing for the online education model, we have been working on expanding our Feeding Program. Last week we provided over 1,200 meals a day, and we expect that number will rise in the weeks to come. To prepare for that, we will be adding feeding sites across the district beginning March 25th. Moreover, we will be expanding the use of busses to deliver food to bus stops for families who cannot get to feeding sites. More information will come out on Monday regarding the additional school sites and bus stop locations.


   


  "For parents who have high school aged children, we know that you have many questions. Please be sure to reach out to your child's teachers, guidance counselor, and administrators, as they will be able to help. Unfortunately, some questions still do not have answers as only time can tell. I can assure you that as we are provided guidance and timelines, I will share them. While I recognize that many of you are still left questioning the viability of prom, athletic events, field trips, honors programs and more, I can only say that these events are currently cancelled until further notice. While AP and IB have announced their solutions to the 2019-2020 testing situation, we still await word from AICE about their solution to testing. Simply put, we are all doing our best to give high school students the "experience" they expect from high school while in the midst of a pandemic.


   


  "As it pertains to graduation for the Senior Class of 2020, only time will tell whether we will be able to celebrate this monumental occasion at the end of May. What I can assure you is that we will have a graduation for our seniors. They have worked too hard for this moment and we will not deprive them- or you- of this. While I might not be able to tell you what graduation will look like, I can tell you it will happen.


   


  "I fully understand that these are uncertain times. As your Superintendent, I simply cannot express how proud I am of our teachers, staff, and administrators who have worked throughout Spring Break to ensure the best educational environment for your child. Similarly, there have been those behind the scenes, the district staff, who have worked tirelessly to support our schools with the goal of resuming instruction on March 30th. This has been no small feat, and yet all parties came together to guarantee that your children's educational goals were not stopped in the face of a global pandemic. Finally, I am beyond proud of the students who are dealing with this historic change that has upended the routine of their lives. While some students have mentioned their hesitation to begin this new normal, some have been excited to continue their education at home while staying healthy. Regardless of the emotion, I am so proud of each of our students and I say to each of you… we will get through this together.


   


  "Parents, please stay tuned for the information you will receive this week and thank you from the bottom of my heart for your encouraging messages, prayers and support. Okaloosa is the best because of the community we live in and I am thankful!


   


  Sincerely,


   


  Marcus Chambers"

There have been the stars we all know about, but there have been many others signed, some simply as stop gaps, some as youth starlets who got the fans excited but never fulfilled their potential and some who were just weird transfers out of the blue.

  Highlighting why it is important for churches to connect digitally their worshippers during the coronavirus outbreak, he added: “With so much fear and uncertainty I thought it would be good to do something to share a positive message to bring hope and encouragement to people at a time of need.”


  And an encore is definitely on the cards, says Rev. Saunders.

Ultraviolet lights can kill up to 97.7 percent of pathogens in an operating room, according to a 2019 study by the American Journal of Infection Control. The study looked at a specific device -- PurpleSun -- which is designed to be used in medical settings. While the technology did decrease the chances of infection in patients, the study says that UV lights can't completely replace traditional cleaning and chemical disinfection, but should be used in tandem.

_Biometrics -_ The big surprise with the Galaxy S20 range is Samsung did not use Qualcomm’s next-gen 3D Sonic Max fingerprint scanner, despite it being available to smartphone makers since September. The Galaxy Note 20 line-up surely fixes this mistake and given its faster scanning time, support for a much wider reading area (making no-look unlocks easier) and dual fingerprints, this would be a big upgrade from the hit and miss gen-one sensor in Galaxy S20 phones.

Kansas State basketball assistant Brad Korn has been named head men's coach at Southeast Missouri, the school announced Monday.


   


  SEMO will hold a closed introduction and show it live online at 2 p.m. Tuesday on the GoSoutheast Facebook page.


   


  Korn leaves K-State coach Bruce Weber's staff after four seasons as a full- time assistant. He also served as the Wildcats' director of operations in 2012-13 before taking an assistant job at Missouri State from 2013-16.


   


  It is the first head coaching job for Korn, 38, who played for Weber at Southern Illinois, where he started his coaching career in 2004 as a graduate assistant and spent six seasons as a full-time assistant under current K-State associate head coach Chris Lowery. He agreed to a five-year contract that will run through April 30, 2025.


   


  "I'm just super excited for Brad on earning this well-deserved opportunity to become the head coach at SE Missouri State," Weber said in a statement released by K-State. "Obviously I have known him for a long time, having recruited him to Southern Illinois, and then hiring him twice at K-State, so I have seen his growth first hand and how he has worked his way up and paid his dues to get this chance.


   


  "He has really developed and matured as a coach since we hired him back in 2016 (as an assistant coach) after his time at Missouri State. He is really good with the players and in recruiting, is great with the X's and O's and has all the qualities to be a great head coach."


   


  Korn replaces Rick Ray, who was fired last month after five seasons, and becomes seventh head coach in Southeast's NCAA Division I men's basketball era. The Redhawks compete in the Ohio Valley Conference.


   


  "I'm excited to welcome Brad and his family to Cape Girardeau," Southeast Missouri athletic director Brady Barke said in a statement. "Brad is a winner and has an incredible knack for building relationships with student-athletes, while developing them both on and off the court.


   


  "His energy and passion will bring a renewed sense of excitement to SEMO basketball."


   


  Weber said Korn should be a good fit at Southeast Missouri.


   


  "Every job has its challenges, but he has an athletic director (Barke) that we are all familiar with during our time at SIU, who will work together with Brad to help make SEMO as successful as possible," Weber said. "He knows the region very well, having spent time as an assistant at both SIU and Missouri State, and will have a good understanding on how to win there."

Officials in Ringgold are exploring the possibility of implementing some kind of anonymous survey as a way to check in and keep tabs on morale amid allegations of misconduct by now-former employees.


  During the March 9 City Council meeting, the board discussed ideas that were first brought up at the end of January when Dan Bilbrey, the city’s chief of police for 10 years, turned in his resignation. Bilbrey did so during the citizens’ comments section of the Jan. 27 council meeting citing lack of support from the council and city manager, insufficient equipment for officers, and alleged that City Manager Dan Wright placed a tracking device on his police vehicle to keep tabs on.


  Since Bilbrey’s resignation, council member Randall Franks and others have brainstormed ways they can get feedback from employees as discretely as possible.


  “This is in a way a reflection of what you (Mayor Nick Millwood) put on the agenda a few weeks back, mayor -- a way that we could encourage better communication between our employees and the council as well as the city manager’s office -- to create a possibility of an anonymous survey of sorts that would allow us to sort of take the pulse of our employees on various topics that would be of value to them as well as us in our guidance going forward,” Franks said.


  Franks said the trick is determining exactly how to construct the survey to get the most out of it.


  “Defining exactly what is part of that particular survey would be something we would love to work with our HR department on as well as the city manager’s office,” Franks said. “Get the specific needs that would provide us the best information in the future,” Franks said.


  The mayor and council agreed to revisit the plan during the next regularly scheduled meeting.


  “I think this is something we’ll look at again in a couple of weeks, but that’s what we’re looking at at this point,” Franks said.

"The pandemic is accelerating," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday. When Tedros spoke, the number of coronavirus cases worldwide had recently shot past 300,000. As of Tuesday morning ET, that figure was already closing in on 400,000 and at least 17,000 people had died from COVID-19.


  In announcing the decision to delay the Tokyo Games, the organizers said the Olympic flame — which recently reached Japan after being lit in Greece — will remain in Japan until the postponed games are held.


  They also said the name of the games — which is plastered on signs, toys and all manner of branded materials — will not change. Despite being held in 2021, the upcoming Olympics will retain the formal title of "Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020."


  The organizers say they hope that eventually, "the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present."


  In addition to the potential risks to public safety that massive Olympics crowds would entail at a time when a pandemic is raging, athletes in many countries have seen their training disrupted or interrupted. The coronavirus has also forced a number of high-profile qualifying competitions to be canceled or postponed.


  The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee joined those calling for a postponement, releasing a statement saying that after speaking with athletes on the team, the committee had concluded that "the enormous disruptions to the training environment, doping controls and qualification process can't be overcome in a satisfactory manner."


  The U.S. committee urged the IOC to ensure that the Tokyo Games are "conducted under safe and fair conditions for all competitors."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 24th March, 2020) The Finns Party has announced it was temporarily withdrawing its no-confidence motion in the government in order to back Helsinki's efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, the media reported on Tuesday.


  The opposition party filed its motion on March 11 with a request that the government clarify the nation's migration policy in light of the current situation at the Greek-Turkish border. The government was due to respond on Wednesday.


  The Finnish Yle broadcaster reported that the party would return to the migrant issue once the health crisis was over.


  According to the nationalist party, there is uncertainty over how the government is going to prevent a new migrant crisis in the European Union, and the official statements issued thus far have been contradictory.

PRATT -- His voice has been a familiar friend for about two decades to Pratt- area sports fans, but Dick Anderson was to give his final broadcast for KMMM AM 1290 Pratt radio at the end of the spring sports season.


   


  That was the plan before the coronavirus hit the country and caused the cancellation of all spring sports.


   


  "Those were to be my final broadcasts. It's time to come home and turn myself in," Anderson said.


   


  Anderson has been announcing games for KMMM for 18 years. He covers football, basketball, baseball, softball and selected volleyball games, plus state games for Pratt High School. He covers conference basketball games plus selected home baseball and softball games for Pratt Community College.


   


  Anderson said he was nervous when he started broadcasting. He had no experience behind the mic and let his audience know how he felt.


   


  "This is the first time I ever did anything like this so if I sound terrible, I'm sorry," Anderson said. "That's how I got started."


   


  On average, Anderson broadcast around 100 games a year, more when teams makes state tournaments. He estimates he has broadcast 1,800 to 2,000 games total.


   


  "There's hardly a town in south-central Kansas I haven't done a ball game," Anderson said.


   


  Anderson said he has no regrets, other than not starting to broadcast when he was 18.


   


  "Somehow God put me here and he knew this was the best place for me," Anderson said. "I'd do it again in a heartbeat."


   


  Anderson's wife Beverly has been understanding even though he has been gone a lot of evenings. Anderson has become so well known in the community that his wife won't go to Walmart with him any more because so many people stop Anderson and want to talk.


   


  "Bev and I have been married 31 years. I've been doing this about half of my married life," Anderson said. "I've got the best wife. This woman has put up with me for 31 years."


   


  Anderson, who is 74, didn't start his radio career until he was in his mid-50s. Before that, he was selling cars in Wichita at Davis Moore and driving 140 miles a day for work. After four years of working there, he was tired of the driving and wanted to come home to Pratt.


   


  Eric Stroble offered Anderson a job at KMMM in advertising sales. So, in the spring 2002, Anderson came back to Pratt and used his selling skills in Pratt, St. John, Medicine Lodge and Greensburg.


   


  In April 2002, Anderson was asked if he would do a baseball sports broadcast. When football season started, Anderson said he would do sports broadcast until the station found someone else.


   


  Little did he know where that decision would lead.


   


  "I didn't know what I was getting into," Anderson said.

With the weather not being as one would like it...it's a little grey and gloomy here right now...and social distancing meaning no play dates with their friends... the bears decided to play hide and seek in doors. Teddy thought he had found the perfect place to hide from Tedward. Teddy got his idea from having a play date with one of his friends at Christmas time. You see his friend Rupert has an Elf who comes to visit each Christmas. He keeps and eye on Rupert to make sure he is being good and reports back to Santa. Teddy and Tedward are really pleased that there is no Elf hiding in their home and watching them. They are often up to no good and would never have Santa come visit with them. Anyway the Elf had slipped into the hole in the middle of the toilet paper roll and was very hard to find...in fact the bears never did find him. They had to give up. So long story short....Teddy thought that was where he would hide. He forgot to take into account that he is not quite as slender as Elf. Wouldnt you know it. Teddy got stuck. He had to call on Tedward to come rescue him. As luck would have it Tedward is a great climber. I think he has dreams of climbing Mount Everest just like Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay did. For a small bear he has some very big dreams. Anyway Tedward managed to rescue Teddy. Teddy decided after that he did not want to play hide and seek any more and found other things to do.

LAWRENCE -- The coronavirus has thrust the sports world into a state of indefinite uncertainty, and that reality hits home locally at the University of Kansas.


   


  A near four-decade veteran in collegiate athletics administration, Jeff Long can only recall two events that carried a similar impact -- Magic Johnson's HIV diagnosis in 1991 and 9/11 -- though the Jayhawk athletic director believes neither of those world-changing moments reached the scale of the current pandemic in terms of effect on the sports community.


   


  "It's going to change athletics. It's going to change education, the higher education systems in the United States," Long said Monday. "It's going to change so much that we can't even predict."


   


  Those words came as part of a video news conference, part of the new norm for the second-year AD who has been tasked with guiding the KU athletic department through an unexpected period of both competitive and financial uncertainty.


   


  Long, who as recently as a week ago had never participated in a video conference call, is now hosting at least two a day with his executive staff. He oversaw the March 15 closure of the Jayhawk athletic department offices, and through that, Long has stressed the importance of continued communication between coaches, trainers, staff members and mental health professionals and the student-athletes they serve.


   


  Long said approximately 75 student-athletes remain in Lawrence in on- and off-campus housing, though lines remain open through the recent implementation of a mobile app called Teamworks.


   


  Douglas County, like most of the Kansas City metro area, will implement a stay-at-home order beginning at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, with only essential trips permitted. That policy will last through April 23.


   


  "I would tell you in the second week we're starting to develop a routine," Long said, "but this last I would say 10, 12 days has been herky-jerky as we bring online the new technologies."


   


  Only "one or two" athletes have been tested for coronavirus, Long said, and to his knowledge both of those tests came back negative. Long added he's not aware of any staff or coaches who have tested positive nor anyone being monitored, though he noted the virus can take up to 14 days to show symptoms.


   


  Long canceled all athletic travel indefinitely and suspended all home and away competitions on March 12, just hours before the cancellation of the NCAA men's and women's basketball tournaments. The Big 12 canceled all spring conference and nonconference competitions the following day.


   


  It is a "big blow" to the KU football program and second-year head coach Les Miles, Long said, with all parties hopeful for nationwide spring practices in June, an extension of the preseason in August or other measures that would make up for lost time.


   


  "Certainly there's some question about the September football season starting off," Long said. "Again, we'll have to adjust to that. We all know competitively and preparing our student-athletes is very important, so we'll be working to get some extension of time that our coaches can practice with student-athletes prior to next season."


   


  While the health and well-being of everyone within the KU athletic department is at the forefront of Long's mind, it's impossible not to acknowledge the financial ramifications of the lost NCAA Tournament run and spring sports slate as well as the indefinite grounding of all fundraising personnel.


   


  KU has extended all part-time and graduate employees and its event workers through the remainder of this academic year, guaranteeing those salaries. However, Long said the department is looking at potential cuts, exploring what 10-20% reductions in operations would look like, if needed.


   


  "Again, most of that is determined on how far and how long this crisis lasts," he said.


   


  Long has also extended season ticket deadlines and directed his staff to be innovative with payment plans in attempts to ease the financial burden put on Jayhawk supporters in the dipping economic climate.


   


  "Yes, there is concern, but I would tell you our fans have been great," Long said. "They've stuck with us through thick and thin over the years, through economic downturns. So are we concerned? Yes. Are we confident, though, our fans and supporters will be there for us? We are."


   


  If nothing else, this has all been an admittedly awkward experience for the extroverted Long.


   


  "I'm a high-energy person … (and) I'm used to bounding across the hall back and forth to coaches' offices, staff offices," Long said. "Now I'm sitting in front of this computer or I'm on these phones and I'm texting and I'm doing whatever, and it's different. It's a different stress level. It's a different management challenge, one that is awkward and uncomfortable, because we're driven by the people around us. We get energy from those coaches and student- athletes."
