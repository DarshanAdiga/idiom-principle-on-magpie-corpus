The Burns Lake track, owned by the School District 91, has been undergoing a face-lift and the work is currently progressing in full swing. The track is being re-leveled and resurfaced with asphalt which will prove to be useful for residents all-year long, including the rough winter months.

FUJAIRAH, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 03rd Jun, 2020) Oil product stockpiles rebounded to a record high at the UAE’s East Coast Port of Fujairah as of 1st June, led by gains in heavy fuels used in marine and power industries.             The total stockpiles climbed 6.5 percent in the week ended 1st June to 30.71 million barrels, according to data released 3rd June by the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone, FOIZ. The total has hit four all-time highs in the last five weeks, signalling the global slump in gasoline demand to jet fuel and marine bunkers.             "The real demand is not there as of yet," a source in Fujairah told S&P Global Platts. "The demand for bunker fuel is also reduced, and that's a major factor because it's one of the key activities. Demand for storage is still there, but the contango has been reduced so it's not as attractive as it was a month ago."             Heavy distillates and residues, covering fuels used for marine bunkers and power generation, jumped eight percent to a two-week high of 16.164 million barrels.             Light distillates such as gasoline increased seven percent to 8.

Finally, we should note that this strategy isn't a silver bullet for everyone's situation. Let's say your negative equity is closer to $10,000. Using our $35K vehicle as an example, your monthly payments would be lower, but the loan would cost about $3,200 more in the long run.

The first couple of weeks of the pandemic closures in the county, the airport was only receiving 10% of its normal revenue, Letney said. By the end of the first month and through April, they were sitting at 33% and by May they were at 55% of normal business.
 Now, they are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel from the pandemic as revenue has continued to rise.
 “It’s actually come back where I think that if the trend continues, we might be back to normal in a couple months,” he said.
 Letney called Texas a block grant state, meaning the Texas Department of Transportation works as the agent for all airports in the state. He said they spearheaded the movement to help get relief for airports through the CARES Group Four Grant.
 The grant money is open for any Federal Aviation Administration-approved expense for a federally obligated airport, he said.
 “We can use it for any expense to cover any loss that we’ve had,” Letney said. “It doesn’t really matter where you use it because it all goes into the airport fund and just gets spent.”
 Additionally, the airport qualified for Group 1 funding because of its $1.6 million project to build a game fence around the airport. The airport should receive 90% of the project funded through the FAA and TxDOT, but they were expected to pay 10% of that funding themselves.
 However, the Group 1 funding pays 100% of projects completed in physical year 2020, Letney said. The whole fencing project cannot be completed in 2020, but the remaining 10% should be completed and paid for through the Group 1 grant.
 “By the end, you add both of them together … it goes a long way,” Letney said.

A review by the Commission on Human Medicines determined it was safe to take ibuprofen for coronavirus symptoms.


  The BBC reports the new trial, called Liberate, will use a special formulation of ibuprofen rather than the regular pills people may usually buy over the counter.


  Some people already take lipid ibuprofen for conditions like arthritis.


  If you experience mild coronavirus symptoms, the NHS advises people to use paracetamol first as it has fewer side-effects than ibuprofen.


  An estimated 230 participants will be part of the new clinical trial.

India fast bowler Mohammed Shami says he will be able to reverse-swing the ball even if saliva is banned during the coronavirus pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                    The International Cricket Council (ICC) is expected to next week order a temporary ban on using saliva, as part of measures to get the sport started again while reducing the risk of spreading the virus.                                                                                                                                                                    Bowlers traditionally get the ball to move in the air, deceiving the batsman, by shining one side using sweat or saliva.                                                                                                                                                                    "There will be difficulties. We have been accustomed to using saliva since childhood," Shami said in an online discussion.                                                                                                                                                                    "If you are a fast bowler, instinctively you apply saliva to shine the ball. But yes, if you can maintain the shine of the dry ball, it will definitely reverse."                                                                                                                                                                    The 29-year-old, renowned for his reverse swing, offered no alternative but insisted that sweat is not a viable replacement.                                                                                                                                                                    "Sweat and saliva work differently. I don't think it will help. I never tried bowling without saliva," he said. "Now because of COVID-19 pandemic, it's very important to stop using saliva."                                                                                                                                                                    Australian ball manufacturer Kookaburra is developing a wax applicator to shine the ball, but the world body is reluctant to allow artificial aids.                                                                                                                                                                    Cricket, like nearly all sport, was halted in March when India and many other nations ordered lockdowns.                                                                                                                                                                     With the ICC due to make a call next week on whether the Twenty20 World Cup will go ahead in Australia in October-November, Shami said players would need at least two weeks to prepare.                                                                                                                                                                    "We are not machines, can't just switch on and off. As a sportsman, your body needs to get into rhythm," he said.                                                                                                                                                                    "No one has touched bat and ball in this period. So a 10-15 days camp or a couple of series before the World Cup will be helpful to get back the momentum."

And we just need to do what we can at every and any level to eliminate hate, to eliminate racism. We're going to take a stance on it in the Big Ten. I'm personally invested in this."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Warren also said he and his wife, Greta, will be donating $100,000 to the National Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                It was one year ago Tuesday, that Warren, a former NFL executive with the Minnesota Vikings, was offered the job of Big Ten commissioner. He officially took over for former commissioner Jim Delany in January and has been dealing with crises in college sports ever since, starting with a pandemic that forced the cancellation of the NCAA basketball tournament and the rest of spring sports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Schools are beginning to bring athletes back to campus for voluntary workouts. The NCAA gave the go-ahead for schools to start that process on on June 1, providing hope that football season will go on as scheduled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                "These next 30 to 40 days are going to be critical," Warren said. "But I am very a positive person. I'm cautiously optimistic as fall as sports are concerned. But every single day, starting today in the month of June and the first part of July, will be will be critical for us to truly understand all the health and safety issues that will help us make a proper decision as we go into the fall."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                While the Big 12, Pac-12 and Southeastern Conferences have set specific dates when those voluntary athletic activities can begin, the Big Ten -- which spans from Rutgers in New Jersey to Nebraska -- has left it up to each school to determine when is best to re-start.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                "I trust our chancellors, our presidents and our athletic directors and our coaches and our student-athletes," Warren said. "I trust our people on our campus that they're going to do the right thing, that they will always put the health and wellness and safety of our student athletes front and center."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Protests against police violence against minorities have swept across the country following Floyd's death. Warren said he felt a responsibility to 10,000 student athletes in the Big Ten to try to combat systemic racism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                "I may look back over my career, my entire career, and forming this coalition and the work that comes out of it could end up having the biggest impact on society than anything else I've ever done," Warren said.

A gold-medal winning Paralympian who is registered blind said practising social distancing while training "is not the easiest".            Libby Clegg, who won both the 100m T11 and 200m T11 at the Rio Paralympics in 2016, began the year reaching the final of TV's Dancing on Ice but has found this lockdown a challenge to her independence.            Libby and her partner Dan - who is also visually impaired - have found socially distancing difficult because of their sight problems.            And the mother-of-one, who trains in Loughborough, Leicestershire, can no longer be tethered to her guide when training, so she can not run as quickly.

The well-known bookmaker turned publican commented on his frustration stating “I have adhered to all the advice personally, 2km, 5km etc. I cancelled all live music and parties at the pub prior to the mandatory closing in the early stages of the pandemic, however, I feel that the proposed reopening guidelines are completely unjust, my pub is bigger than many of the restaurants nationwide that are set to open on June 29th. We are happy that we can implement social distancing and provide a safe service to our customers and I cannot fathom how the guidelines are industry-specific rather than venue appropriate. I have been in business all my life and it simply makes no sense at all and quite frankly I’ve had enough.” he said.

Idrove to the Kemil Road beach parking lot and, frankly, didn’t expect to find a spot on a sunny Saturday. There were a few spots open, but rangers were there — and at other lots throughout the Indiana Dunes National Park — to track cars and crowds and close it off when there were too many.                                                                                                                                                                    Hello, summer of COVID-19.                                                                                                                                                                    I drove a little farther to the Dunbar access lot, then hiked down the now-closed Lakefront Drive to survey the winter erosion at the Lake View beach here in Beverly Shores. A lizard, likely a six-lined race runner, darted near the orange barrels where the earth dropped off at the very edge of the pavement — eaten by Lake Michigan’s storm surges.

Wurtz and Stallcup met in high school and re-connected when Wurtz opened the shop in Nampa in 2016. They’ve since relocated the business to Garden City. All of the frame-off builds are new down to the nuts and bolts but Rawhide caters to every individual rider and bike’s needs. It prides itself on being an unintimidating shop, and although creativity and style are important, safety is at the forefront of everything it does.                                                                                                                                                    A lot of its customers are first-time bike owners, and the shop takes a hands-on approach to making sure they feel comfortable and understand the process.                                                                                                                                                    “On a bike, safety is so important and that’s a lot of trust people put into us, and we care about that and take a lot of pride in what we do,” said Wurtz. “Our motto is to make every bike as safe and reliable as possible. It’s about quality, not just cosmetic work.”                                                                                                                                                    Rawhide specializes in pre-1979 Honda motorcycles and pre-1985 Harley Davidsons. Wurtz named the shop after a 1967 Ford Mustang drag car named Rawhide that his grandfather built in the ‘70s and won awards from the Boise National Roadster Show.                                                                                                                                                    Wurtz has also won awards for his motorcycle restoration and custom builds. Beyond growing up in the culture, he also moved to California at 24 and apprenticed at Charley’s Place, a vintage specialty bike shop established in 1993 in San Francisco, for six years.                                                                                                                                                    When he moved back to Idaho in 2016, he opened the shop and Stallcup, who had been working on cars and fabrication since high school, started two weeks later. Wurtz entered a bike into the Boise National Roadster Show, won an award and started getting busy. The bike was a gold 1971 Honda CB 750 and Wurtz said it brought him a ton of business.

First, the nuts and bolts: An option is a contract that gives its holder the right either to buy shares at a fixed price (a _call_ option) or to sell shares at a fixed price (a _put_ option). The price at which you can either buy or sell the underlying shares is the _strike price,_ and the price of the contract itself is the _premium._ You’ll pay the premium if you purchase an option, or you’ll pocket the premium if you sell a contract to someone else. An option contract represents 100 shares of the underlying stock, and the contract expires on a fixed date; the holder may exercise an option on or before that date. Listed premiums are multiplied by 100. For example, if the premium is listed at 50 cents, it means the cost of buying that contract is $50.

Adapty partnered with Insite, an Episerver company, and Digital DNA Marketing agency to implement InsiteOnline, an out-of-the-box commerce solution, for the process equipment distribution business of Carotek.            The shift to digital was imperative in the B2B (business to business) space and particularly now in the economic crisis caused by Covid19 pandemic it has gained more significance.            Digital transformation in traditional manufacturing and distribution business has the potential to completely change how clients interact with brands and run their businesses.            Carotek a leading distributor of process equipment in the USA, partnered with Adapty to implement a responsive B2B platform. As part of the implementation, the corporate site and e-commerce portal were merged to give the customer a single site view thereby improving the user experience.            The implementation delivered improved customer experience and reduced customer service dependency. This is the first ever InsiteOnline platform implementation for B2B business.            Comments on the News            "Adapty implemented our new InsiteOnline website for Carotek.com. Because this was a new platform, the challenges were higher than normal. Adapty was extremely diligent at problem solving, and very thorough in the QA process. They were willing to go the extra mile to get things done correctly. They were patient with the learning necessary to complete implementation and very supportive during launch," said Carotek.            Adapty besides having solid B2C e-commerce capability also specializes in providing B2B digital commerce solutions for manufacturing and distribution businesses worldwide.

Focus on insurance and high quality retail banks like HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank, says Nischal Maheshwari, CEO- Institutional Equities.   How long can one remain invested in this steroid or liquidity-infused market because those who think it is only liquidity are not participating and are feeling left out and those who are participating know that this could turn any time. So what should one do? This is a liquidity-infused market and I believe for the next six to nine months, this liquidity will be there and you may find more of this liquidity coming in as countries across the world face more challenges. So I do not think this rally is obvious. This liquidity will not go away in a hurry; so you have to be at least invested. What kind of stocks you choose to invest in is different but I believe you should be invested almost fully in this kind of a market.   What are the last three purchases you have done on behalf of your clients? The markets are going higher. We can argue whether it is liquidity or valuations or whether it is something else. Bottom line is buying shares is making money. How are you participating in this?  We have continued to say that if you want to be defensive in your portfolio, invest in FMCG or pharma stocks. In case of banks, you should be underweight but focus on insurance and high quality retail banks like HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank. The only difference is we have been saying you should be invested even in metals and that is a clear call. There is liquidity across the world and it will find its way into various classes of assets and metal is one of the assets which is hugely monetised and huge amounts of trading happens on metals. I believe that is another way to actually play this liquidity.   Where do you think Bharti Airtel is headed? It is at an all-time high. For someone who has missed the bus, at what price should one get in again?This is a good price to get into Bharti. Yes, it is an aggressive valuation for the time being but this is one of the companies which is going to show growth in earnings in the current year and it is one of the very few sectors in this economy which is going to show growth in the current year. I definitely see the bottom of the ARPUs being made. We have only around two and a half players in the market and I think it is very clear that Bharti is on a very strong wicket and this is a good price to go in.   Where would you say FMCG stocks are headed? Is buying Britannia at a PE multiple of 60 or Nestle at a PE multiple of 50 sensible or is that like following the herd? At this point of time, I have been recommending only preservation of capital because whatever this market is showing, on the ground things are very-very different. We have been talking to a lot of corporates, distributors and retailers and there is no connection between what is happening in the market and what is really happening on the ground. This is the time to preserve the capital.   FMCG is one of the sectors where the basic demand is still going to continue. So you should be invested. Given that there is so much liquidity, you can participate in the market. You may not outperform at this point of time but preservation of capital and participating in the market is important. That is why FMCG is where most of the people are hiding and we are strongly recommending to remain invested.   What is your perspective with regards to consumption stocks? What are your key takeaways from what you have been hearing from them? They are being conservative and they are saying that this is a tough market. There is going to be down trading, which is going to happen continuously. People are going to buy small packs; so I do not think there is going to be huge volume growth. But definitely they will do around 5% to 10% kind of growth across the sector and I think that is a very good number in this kind of a market where most of the other sectors are going to have a de-growth. There are only two or three sectors which are going to see this kind of growth. Telecom, FMCG and pharma are the three sectors which are going to at least show some growth. Most of the other sectors are going to show a de-growth in FY21. So we continue to believe preservation of capital is very important at this point of time.   What about IndiGo? Tough times ahead for aviation? I agree. At this point of time, there is so much uncertainty around that sector. I think it is best to avoid it. They cannot even match last year’s numbers and it will take another two years for them to come back. What you have to see in this sector is what is the expectation in the market and how much capacity utilisation IndiGo is able to do. According to our estimate, IndiGo would be around 60% to 65% capacity utilisation and they will be able to manage through the year, which means that a price closer to around Rs 800-850 is a better price to enter IndiGo rather than at current prices.   You are seeing a surge in two-wheeler names and selective CV names with focus on the rural end of the market. You have also seen a big surge come by in ancillaries. Do you believe there is a fundamental buy here or do you think this is just a near-term bounce?My view on auto for the two or three quarters has been that two wheelers is the space you need to be in. Before Covid also, we believed that two wheelers are going to do much better because they are low ticket discretionary items compared to a car and we believe they are going to achieve their volumes. Again post-Covid, we continue to believe that this is the first place where discretionary purchases are going to happen even if we believe that people are going to go back travelling individually and not travelling together. Also, given that everybody’s income has come down, people will prefer a two-wheeler rather than going in for a four-wheeler for travelling. We like Hero Honda, which is more focussed on the rural side. Bajaj also is a good play because 50% of it is in exports. Both these stocks look pretty good as far as two wheelers are concerned.   The other space which we like is the tractor space. Again, with rural focus, there is a huge amount of support coming from the government; so both Mahindra & Mahindra and Escorts look good in that space. As far as auto ancillary is concerned, I would avoid most of them except for Motherson because Motherson largely has only 10% to 12% exposure in India and remaining is all over the world and we are seeing the world opening up much faster than India. You have to be very selective in autos. Maruti is an avoid at these prices; below Rs 5,000 one should keep on accumulating Maruti.

Wurtz said it’s like an art gallery for motorcycles.                                                                                                                                                    Stallcup said older bikes are typically more stylish and reliable. Although bikes really gained in popularity after WWII, in the last ten to 15 years the culture around them has exploded.                                                                                                                                                    Wurtz and Stallcup said what’s great about what they do is that they are bringing back bikes that are just sitting around and putting them back on the road. In a way it’s a bit like recycling, but Stallcup said bikes never waned in popularity for die-hard fans.                                                                                                                                                    “There’s all these clichés about why people like motorcycles,” said Stallcup. “Like about freedom and getting out on the open road but at the end of the day they’re just fun and wild to ride.”                                                                                                                                                    That sentiment echoes with Rawhide’s customers, and many have left rave reviews. The shop is booked out six weeks in advance and Wurtz said they just want to keep growing to accommodate the influx whether it’s restoration, repair or custom building.                                                                                                                                                    “We do everything even rebuild engines but also people come in with their own ideas and it’s just like commissioned art and we take the time to do it right,” said Wurtz. “We figure out how to make the customers ideas work, we make the ideas functional, stylish and safe.”

This past weekend, I like many others watched the protests on the streets of Bakersfield over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. On the third evening of protests, I caught a glimpse of one of Clinica Sierra Vista’s nurses in the crowd of peaceful protesters standing in MLK park with a sign that read “Black Lives Matter to Nurses.” It reminded me that just like these protesters, we all have a message that needs to be heard.                                                                                                                                                            At community health centers throughout this nation, medical professionals come to work believing that all lives matter and that health care is a right, not a privilege. Community health centers have been providing care for 55 years, protecting the most vulnerable populations in our community, regardless of who they are or their ability to pay.                                                                                                                                                            The staff of Clinica Sierra Vista over the last several months have left the safety of their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, performed more than 2,600 COVID-19 tests and served the more than 140,000 patients we see each year in Kern and Fresno counties. The daily sacrifices may be routine by now, but they don’t go unnoticed.                                                                                                                                                            Neither does our employees’ fight for social justice on behalf of our patients. It’s all around us, and it’s inspiring. I’ve never been more honored to stand behind these frontline health care workers who put themselves out there every day taking care of the homeless, uninsured, minority, LGBTQ, impoverished, stigmatized, mentally ill, undereducated and immigrant populations of our community.                                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately, the legislators and governor of the great state of California, in order to balance a historic impending budget deficit, have put forward proposals that will drastically cut services to community health centers in the May revise draft. Those cuts target the most vulnerable populations and their ability to receive care and have a voice in the system.                                                                                                                                                            Since January, Clinica has provided more than 35,000 telehealth visits to our patients, which includes doctor or nurse consultations, ER visit follow-ups and prescription refills. Thousands of services provided to a vulnerable population amid one of the greatest heath challenges in more than 100 years. While health care providers have been compensated for virtual video visits, the addition of telephonic visits was newly added due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinica quickly added virtual visits to our capabilities at the beginning of the pandemic, but realized the patients we serve are largely not ready to adopt this new technology. More than 99 percent of Clinica’s telehealth visits have been by phone. We are struggling daily to teach our patients how to use the virtual visit platform and the many benefits of doing so. There are many barriers for our patients, including access to smart devices and reliable internet services, which can prohibit the adoption of this technology despite our efforts.                                                                                                                                                            The May revise budget further adds to this challenge with the removal of payment for telephonic visits. This change further destabilizes our ability to provide care to the most vulnerable in our community, including patients such as the elderly, high-risk pediatric patients and adults with multiple or serious health conditions that place them at high risk for severe complications or death from COVID-19. These patients are best served from the safety of their homes where they are sheltering in place during this pandemic. Telephonic visits also help people just getting back to work receive care while not jeopardizing their new employment.                                                                                                                                                            Many community health centers throughout the state have struggled with the financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reimbursement of telephonic visits was a lifeline for many of the smaller practices at a time when everything came to a standstill and we were struggling with ways to protect our workers and patients along with the high cost of doing so.                                                                                                                                                            Gov. Newsom, there is still time to do the right thing. Fix this budget and stabilize our safety net providers, allowing community health centers to continue to take care of our patients through telephonic visits.                                                                                                                                                            We need to continue to fight social injustice, help the most vulnerable in our community and we must remind the governor these budget proposals are hurting all of our citizens.                                                                                                                                                             _Stacy Ferreira serves as the interim CEO for Clinica Sierra Vista.

"Work on the request the PBO referred to has, in fact, been impacted by COVID-19 given the requirements for our analysts to work from secure systems inaccessible from home," Defence Department spokesman Daniel Le Bouthillier said an in email.                                                                                                                                                    He went on to blame personnel having "limited access to certain records and databases" and "key military staff" being tasked with supporting the government's COVID-19 response for not responding to the order paper question.                                                                                                                                                    At the same time, Le Bouthillier said officials did respond to 12 order paper questions while Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan's office said officials helped the budget officer analyze the cost of the military's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in April.                                                                                                                                                    "The Department of National Defence and the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces have been working around the clock helping Canadians during this pandemic," Sajjan's spokesman, Todd Lane, said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                    "Despite the challenges that the pandemic has posed, we remain committed to transparency and being accountable to Parliament."                                                                                                                                                    Bezan nonetheless accused the government and department of failing to provide information to Canadians and parliamentarians, whose job is to hold the government to account.                                                                                                                                                    "At the beginning (of the pandemic), I would say they had the right to make those decisions," he said. "But we're getting to a point now that this has become a government and Minister Sajjan, in particular, stonewalling the accountability aspect of his role."                                                                                                                                                    If there are legitimate concerns, he added, efforts should be underway to install proper protocols and provide adequate safety equipment to let defence officials return to their offices and "fulfil the obligations the government has to Parliament."

Physical distancing of six feet will be promoted and maintained in addition to other safety precautions including discouraging unnecessary physical touching like hand shaking and cleaning and sanitizing areas after use.                                                                                                                                                                     “A detailed educational presentation on social distancing, proper use of face masks, hand washing and avoiding any unnecessary physical contact will be provided each day,” read the release.                                                                                                                                                                     According to the release, no overnights camping will be allowed this year and all participants are required to leave the facility immediately following the evaluation of their animal or at the conclusion of the auction.                                                                                                                                                                     To limit the number of people gathering at events, a live feed of the evaluation process and auction will be available for members of the public to watch from home and the buyers will be able to bid online, by phone or proxy.                                                                                                                                                                      “Things will be different, but we are ‘Colusa County strong’ and we will all rise to the occasion together,” said Ford.

"We're currently down to fewer than 25 rooms with shared accommodations at the Halifax campus," Janet Simm, the Northwood facility's chief executive, said in a recent interview.                                                                                                                                                            That's a huge shift from before the pandemic when more than 240 residents lived in two- or three-person units. Now, fewer than 50 people remain in the shared spaces, some of whom are couples or others who specifically request a roommate, Simm said.                                                                                                                                                            But the facility's desire to create more space, which its board sought for years before the pandemic, unfolded through tragedy rather than design.                                                                                                                                                            COVID-19 illnesses spread among the 485 residents after asymptomatic workers brought the virus there in early April, and Simm says the bulk of the 53 who had died, as of Tuesday, and the 240 infected were in shared units.                                                                                                                                                            ---                                                                                                                                                            COVID-19 in sports ...                                                                                                                                                            Khari Jones doesn't have to look far for a reminder that racism exists in Canada.                                                                                                                                                            The Montreal Alouettes head coach divulged during a teleconference Tuesday he received death threats while he was the quarterback of the CFL's Winnipeg Blue Bombers because of his interracial marriage. Jones is black and his wife, Justine, is white.                                                                                                                                                            An emotional Jones — speaking just over a week after a white policeman kneeled on the neck of a black man, resulting in a tragic death in Minneapolis — said the threats came in the form of letters that remain in his possession.                                                                                                                                                            "It's just a reminder you always have to be on alert a little bit," Jones said. "It could've been one person but one is still too many and to do that on the basis of a person's skin colour is horrible.                                                                                                                                                            "Every once in a while, every blue moon I take a look at them. They never found the person who wrote the letters — he used a fake name — but he's still out there, people like him are still out there. That was 20-something years ago and it's still happening."                                                                                                                                                            ---                                                                                                                                                            Interest rate announcement looms ...                                                                                                                                                            The Bank of Canada is expected to keep its key interest rate unchanged this morning on the first day of governor Tiff Macklem's tenure.                                                                                                                                                            Economists expect the central bank will maintain its target for the overnight rate at 0.25 per cent, which former governor Stephen Poloz has repeatedly said is as low as it can go.                                                                                                                                                            Poloz and the bank's governing council would have met over the past few days and finalized the rate decision last night.                                                                                                                                                            Macklem likely would have been part of the meetings, but it's unlikely that the language of the rate announcement will fully capture his views.                                                                                                                                                            Instead of focusing on the rate itself, experts say they will be paying close attention to the language used in the rate announcement about the expected path for the economy in the coming weeks and months.                                                                                                                                                            ---                                                                                                                                                            This report by The Canadian Press was first published June 3, 2020

But the pandemic-driven shutdown turned Zoom into a tool for employees who once worked alongside each other, but have been doing their jobs from home during the past few months.

Keep in mind, this is a tropical air mass. Even though the clouds keep much of the sun away and it feels cooler to you, the humidity is quite high. That means your body will still have a difficult time cooling itself since the sweat cannot evaporate off your skin. If you do go for a run or exercise outside today, you'll still need to take it easy even though it may feel more comfortable.

The fact that Lee doesn’t take a stand in _Do the Right Thing_ is being ignored by Millennials looking for some cultural touchstone: They mistake Lee’s confusion for their certainty. In the closing gambit of the movie, Lee’s false dichotomy between nonviolent and violent protest (the latter called “intelligence” by Malcolm X) works like a charm for restless youth who hastily prefer Malcolm X’s self-defense over King’s protest.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name appeared on the ballots. On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway to help maximize his influence in the direction of the Democratic Party.

Imad, who scored 267 runs in 43 T20s, said Pakistan wants to reclaim its top spot in the ICC T20 ranking through the series.                                     "We want to regain our top position in T20s. I want to see Pakistan among top three ranked sides in all formats. My personal goal is to perform well and improve my ranking as bowler and as an all rounder. But more important is to win the series because England is one of the best sides in the world." The forthcoming series will be played in a bio-secure environment under fresh guidelines to avoid the spread of coronavirus.                                     The guidelines included a prohibition on using saliva, a practice which almost every bowler follows to shine the ball. According to Wasim, it will be difficult for bowlers to restrain themselves from this habit.                                     "It is very difficult because it's a habit to use saliva on the ball but we will have to respect the ICC's decision.                                     Obviously it is going to be difficult but once you know that someone else's life can be in danger then one willbe more mindful," he said.                                    Imad, who bagged 42 wickets each in 53 ODIs and 43 T20s, respectively, said during the lockdown he spent time with his family but also increased his training to keep himself fit. "These are hard times and it is important to keep yourself fit physically," he said.

The premature end to the career of Jian Zihao, better known by his gaming name "Uzi", shines a harsh spotlight on the lifestyles and training of eSports players.                                                                                                                                                                                                            Uzi is a star League of Legends player for the Chinese team Royal Never Give Up (RNG) and his decision to quit was a top trending topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo.                                                                                                                                                                                                            Chinese media said that he was born in 1997 and experts called him one of the best players in the history of League of Legends, a popular multi-player battle game.                                                                                                                                                                                                             "I regret to tell everyone that I am retiring," Uzi wrote to his nearly five million followers on Weibo.                                                                                                                                                                                                            "Because of chronic stress, obesity, irregular diet, staying up late and other reasons, I was found to have Type-2 diabetes during a physical examination last year."                                                                                                                                                                                                            Uzi also said that he was suffering a hand injury, a common complaint in eSports.                                                                                                                                                                                                            RNG said that Uzi, who made his debut in professional eSports in 2012, suffered "injuries accumulated over eight years of high-intensity training".                                                                                                                                                                                                            They described him as "not only the heart and soul of RNG, but also an icon in the eSports world as a whole".                                                                                                                                                                                                            "In addition to doing everything we can to assist him in his future endeavours, we will also be by his side to help him on his journey to injury recovery," RNG added.                                                                                                                                                                                                            "We are here to help him recover 100 percent."                                                                                                                                                                                                            There are potentially huge financial rewards in eSports, a fast-growing industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                            But players can pay a high physical and mental toll because of sedentary lifestyles, long hours in front of screens, poor diets and repetitive hand and arm movements.                                                                                                                                                                                                             A record $33.5 million was up for grabs at The International in Shanghai last year, where teams competed in the multi-player battle game Dota 2 for thousands of fans in an arena.                                                                                                                                                                                                            But players told AFP that deteriorating eyesight, digestive problems and wrist and hand damage were all threats to their careers over the long term.

Ceon Broughton, 31, was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence for failing to help Louella Fletcher-Michie as she overdosed on illegal party drug 2C-P at Bestival in 2017.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     He was found to have filmed his girlfriend as she pleaded for help shortly before her death in woodland close to the festival site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Following his conviction in February, Broughton, from Enfield, was sentenced to eight and a half years behind bars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     He was given leave to appeal back in March and three judges are due to hear the case this morning via a virtual Court of Appeal hearing.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Hundreds of cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of violent unrest across the U.S., employing a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional.

ISLAMABAD, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 3rd Jun, 2020 ) :All-rounder Imad Wasim cannot wait to get back on the field saying he wants Pakistan to reclaim its top spot in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Twenty20 rankings through the series against England this summer.                                     Imad said he was looking forward to team's tour to England, for three Tests and T20s, as he would return to his routine life.                                     The 31-year-old, who scored 952 runs in 53 ODIs, said that the tour was important for players as it was the first tour following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.                                     "I am very eager to be back on cricket field. It has been a long time, not only for us but for all sports persons. They all want to play their sport and want to get back on the field," Geo news quoted him as saying.                                     The all-rounder was a regular feature in Pakistan's white-ball squad and would likely be named in 25-member squad.                                     "Obviously, for cricket and cricketers it is a very important tour, you are getting back to your life and routine which is very important. The thing is, every cricketer wants to play, weather closed doors or with crowds." According to a tentative plan, Pakistan would play the first Test in Manchester on August 5, followed by next two Tests in Southampton on August 13 and 21, respectively.                                     All three T20s would be played in Manchester on August 28, 30 and September 1.

It is not only China and Russia that are challenging the United States. Across the Middle East, there is a sense that Trump’s oft-expressed desire to withdraw from the region — along with his National Security Strategy’s focus on a renewed competition among superpowers — offers new leeway.
 Iran has bet that Trump, for all his emphasis on doubling down on sanctions as he completes America’s exit from the 2015 nuclear deal, is not willing to risk outright confrontation. Tehran has gradually accelerated its production of nuclear fuel and ignored requests from international inspectors for access to suspected nuclear-related sites. But it has not raced ahead, perhaps calculating that a slow rebuilding of its stockpiles will not result in a strong international backlash.
 And in the Persian Gulf, even after the U.S.-led killing in January of Qassem Soleimani, a senior commander in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and Iran’s terrorism mastermind, Tehran is episodically testing America’s limits.
 Nearly a dozen Iranian fast boats conducted what the Navy described as “dangerous and harassing approaches” to six U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf in mid-April, prompting Trump’s order “to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.” Iran backed off in the gulf — but then stepped up oil shipments to Venezuela, in a challenge to the U.S.-led embargo meant to displace President Nicolás Maduro, who has stayed in office despite a vigorous U.S. campaign to force him out.
 In mid-May, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said U.S. attempts to disrupt the course of Iranian tankers carrying fuel for Venezuela were “dangerous” and “provocative” acts. Iran has threatened retaliation against U.S. forces in the gulf and throughout the Middle East if Washington interferes with Tehran’s oil deliveries.

Nawaz Anjum said that the artistes staged a peaceful protest for this purpose in Lahore a few days back adding that they did not break even a single mirror.

Stylish actor Fahad Awan said that Prime Minister, Imran Khan always talked about labourers, vendors and other daily wagers during lockdown adding that most of stage artistes and other supporting staff are also daily wagers.                                     He said that some of them earn Rs 1,000-2,000 daily and theatres have been closed for last three months that has made life much difficult for them.                                     "We are ready to adopt all SOPs of govt including wearing of masks, usage of hand sanitizer and keeping social distancing during our performance on stage if govt allows us to work." he maintained.

A monthly payslip of Rs 7.5 lakh can buy a lot of luxuries. Hirendra Barua, a Senior Captain at a low-cost airline in the country, had all that. A BMW car, flat in a posh colony in Mumbai and business class tickets for family on international holidays.                                                                                                                                                            But in May, Barua got a shock when the airline said it was restructuring his salary. Now he would get a gross monthly salary of Rs 1.25 lakh, which could increase as much as his earlier pay, but it depended on the flying hours.                                                                                                                                                            "Though the airline had resumed services after May 25, when domestic flights re-started across the country, I have flown only one day till now. I don't see myself flying more than 30 to 40 hours a month," says Barua ruefully.

The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the sport's lawmakers, bans players from showing "any political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images".However, pointing to its own anti-racism campaigns, FIFA intimated that no action should necessarily be taken against Sancho, Hakimi or McKennie."The application of the laws of the game approved by the IFAB is left for the competitions organisers which should use common sense and have in consideration the context surrounding the events," FIFA said.The DFB is investigating the players in line with IFAB's laws, although president Fritz Keller said he understood their actions."If people are discriminated against because of the colour of their skin, it is unbearable," said Keller."If they die as a result of the colour of their skin, then I am deeply disturbed. The victims of racism need all of our solidarity."Sancho was booked after revealing the message to mark scoring against Paderborn, although the DFB has said the yellow card was actually because he lifted his shirt over his head."This is defined under rule number 12 as behaviour that is clearly against the rules and should be seen as independent of any political message," said Lutz Michael Froehlich, head of the elite referees unit of the DFB."For referees it is not possible to make a judgement during a match about political, religious or personal slogans, messages or pictures," Froehlich added.",

It is normally the UK's 12th busiest airport, handling 5.1 million passengers last year.            Its location close to the capital's financial district makes it particularly popular with business travellers.            The airport said in a statement it will introduce a series of measures to "provide reassurance" to passengers once it reopens.            These include temperature checking technology for arriving and departing passengers, providing staff with face masks and visors, and "rigorous" cleaning.            The airport will survey travellers on its database to get their thoughts on the future flying experience.            London City chief executive Robert Sinclair said: "When our doors reopen again shortly, our ambition is to provide the best airport experience in the UK to our passengers by ensuring we follow industry guidance to the letter and by maintaining our reputation as the quickest London airport to get to and through.            "While there are many challenges ahead for the UK aviation industry, it is our hope that by outlining the steps we are taking to make the airport safe, and by incorporating the views of our regular travellers into our plans, we will give people the confidence to fly from our airport to destinations across the UK and Europe."

Esta visión de una modesta inclinación de la humilde órbita de la luna tiene algunas consecuencias significativas para nuestra comprensión de Marte y sus lunas. El descubrimiento de la resonancia orbital pasada casi confirma la teoría cíclica de la luna-anillo para Marte. Implica que durante gran parte de su historia, Marte poseía un anillo prominente. Mientras que Deimos tiene miles de millones de años, Cuk y sus colaboradores creen que Phobos es joven a medida que avanzan los objetos astronómicos, formándose tal vez hace solo 200 millones de años, justo a tiempo para los dinosaurios.

“We meet twice a week in usual circumstances so to not see each other and be able to play together has been really weird.
 “There are some of us who don’t miss practice for any reason other than being on holiday so to go for ten weeks without playing together has been really bizarre.
 “For some people, they are not working so it’s their outlet and for others it’s their only real hobby.
 “We all try and practice on our own but it’s not the same. You don’t get that same atmosphere because normally you bounce off each other.
 “We have been meeting up on Zoom socially to chat where we can but we wanted to do something which kept us all playing.
 “We have got a big following in the Tamworth community and we wanted to provide something as light entertainment, light relief just to remind everyone that we are still here and we will be back!”
 The result was a performance of Ellers, composed by Edward John Hopkins in 1869.
 “We were pleased with the results,” said Steph. “We recorded ourselves playing and sent all the videos off to our conductor Alan (Gifford) and he put them all together.
 “It was quite a challenge for him - it’s not something he would usually be doing in his day job.
 “It wasn’t quite the same as playing all together but hearing us and all of our own sounds coming together again, well it was as close as we are going to get for the time being.
 “It has been a comfort to a lot of the band. Some people said they felt overwhelmed by it, having not been able to play for so long.”

The more relevant _Do the Right Thing_ figure is Mother Sister, the neighborhood’s quiet matriarch who erupts into wild, seemingly uncharacteristic exhortations (“Burn it down!”) once the riot commences. As played by Ruby Dee, Mother Sister carries a history of quiet, ladylike disenfranchisement and then lets loose her rage. She never articulates her resentment, which might have connected the film’s many strands of bitterness and recrimination. (Mookie, who precipitates the riot by hurling a garbage can into the pizzeria window, is an obnoxious, irresponsible, unreliable character much like Lee’s own public persona.) Instead, Lee opportunistically shifts into political celebrity worship, the MLK–Malcolm X iconography that stymies the audience’s ability to comprehend. _Do the Right Thing_ ’s entertaining collection of social types becomes issue-oriented rather than insightful.

He said more and more individuals are realizing the impacts by the day and hopes the state makes the needed changes, especially for small businesses and entrepreneurs who rely on independent contractors to carry out their jobs.                                                                                                                                                                    “I think the ultimate solution is to repeal the statute because it affects so many Californians,” he said. “I’m hopeful it will appear on the ballot for Californians to decide.”                                                                                                                                                                    If passed by two-thirds of the state Legislature, the amendment would be included on a future ballot for the public to vote on. ACA 19 was submitted in January 2020 and is pending referral to a committee for discussion.                                                                                                                                                                    “People who are operating as independent contractors, unfortunately, will have to pay attention to how they can find ways to operate under this new law. It’s tough and many people are finding that there isn’t a way to do so, which is why we need to change it,” Gallagher said. “Hopefully we will see some significant change and/or repeal of the law.”

PLYMOUTH - When Gov. Baker opened the state back up for outside activity a couple of weeks ago, the floodgates opened for hikers, bikers, joggers and walkers to get out of their house and explore the town of Plymouth once again.            "They're absolutely everywhere," said Barry DiBlasio, Plymouth's director of community resources. "As soon as they got the go-ahead, people were out there in force using the walking paths at places around town like Morton Park, Hedges Pond and Forges Field. It was great to see all of them out there again."            The recent opening is part of Baker's plan to re-open the state in small stages as it continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic. In this first stage people are now allowed to walk the trails and use town fields in family units to throw a ball if they so choose.            If all goes well, more things will become available to the public once again as we progress into the next stage of the re-opening process. The second phase is scheduled to kick in Monday, June 8, with the third phase beginning three weeks after that as long as everything stays on the correct path and the virus stays on the downslide.            Youth sports teams could conceivably start having restricted practices as soon as the start of the second phase, and game could possibly return, with new and increased safety and health restrictions, in the third phase.            While the fields and walking paths are open again, the playground structure at Forges Field will have to wait until the third phase at the earliest to get back into use.            "We're still getting used to this 'new normal' and we get new information to look over and digest almost every day," DiBlasio said.            Forges Field encompasses 300 acres of land in central Plymouth with a 2-mile paved walking path that winds around the baseball, softball, football, soccer and lacrosse fields that have been become so popular with athletes of all ages over the years.            The summer youth leagues in town are all hoping for the best right now and are beginning preparations to potentially start the season. Plymouth Youth Baseball and Softball announced in April that they would be forced to cancel all their games, but the group now hopes to get in at least a few games for players in the older age levels if the demand is there.            PYBS President Marc Higgins said the Cal Ripken-affiliated group has decided not to offer Tee-Ball or Instructional League at the youngest levels this season because the coronavirus restrictions would hamper a player's ability to learn the game.            Farm League as well as the older kids on the American and National League teams in the baseball and softball programs could be back in action within the next few weeks. League officials and coaches are polling parents right now regarding their thoughts about the starting the season. The league board was to meet Tuesday night to discuss what they've learned.            "I'm hoping that we'll have an absolute answer one way or the other by Thursday morning," Higgins said. "If we have good numbers and people are comfortable, we'll go forward with the season. We really want to have the parents involved in this decision" instead of just leaving it up to a choice of the executive board.            Plymouth Little League and Plymouth Babe Ruth also have their fingers crossed that they will be able to get the season started.            PLL President Mike Ruggiero said the plan the league has in place would allow for a regular season and playoffs and would nut bump into the start of the season for the town's youth soccer and football programs.            Plymouth Little League's plan has the pre-season opening on Monday, June 15, with things like uniform pickups and extra training for the new health rules and regulations that will need to be followed taking up the first week. Two weeks of practice would begin June 22 with Monday, July 6, ushering in the first week of live games.            Games would be played each Monday, Thursday and Saturday on the four baseball diamonds at the Manomet Recreation Area and potentially a couple of more locations around the town.            "We're hoping that we can get in close to a full season for the kids," Ruggiero said. "I'm encouraged that we can safely get it done with an eight to 10 week season that includes a playoff" and would wrap up by the last week in August.            But to get this done, Ruggiero said, concessions will have to be made for player safety and to stop a potential spread of the COVID-19 virus.            There's an entire laundry list of new rules recommended by the national Little League group that the league plans to follow. Some of the highlights of the new rules include no sharing of any equipment between players, all players and coaches must wear face coverings on the field, baseballs will be rotated every couple of innings, no unnecessary contact (first bumps, high-fives, group celebrations) during games, and social distancing will continue to be practiced wherever possible with players and coaches sitting both in the dugout and the adjoining stands. Seating in the dugout would be limited.            Plymouth Babe Ruth President Brian Fabry said his group has been monitoring the ever-changing situation over the past few months and is "ready to go" when they get the green light. He envisions a season that could start at the very end of June and finish in mid-August.            "It's all systems go right now, and we're excited for the opportunity to get in some form of a season this summer," Fabry said. "We're still awaiting more guidance from the state about the best practices and safety guidelines we'll need to follow, but we are focused on making all of this happen for the kids."            Fabry estimated about 200 kids are signed up in the program, a small drop from where they finished last season. They range in age from 13 to 16, and players are placed in one of the league's two divisions. They will play their games at Forges Field as well as Siever Field.

“As a diverse group of leaders, we have a responsibility to stand up and speak out for those who don’t have a voice _ and to stand up and speak out for those who don’t feel it is safe to do so. Witnessing the murder of George Floyd in cold blood and in broad daylight has traumatized our nation, but the reality is that African Americans are targeted and victimized on a daily basis. As NBA coaches, we cannot treat this as an isolated incident of outrage.                                                                                                                                                                    “We are committed to working in our NBA cities with local leaders, officials and law enforcement agencies to create positive change in our communities.

How do we better engage law enforcement?”                                                                                                                                                                    Having conversations and NBA coaches show unity is one of the first small steps, Pierce added, but a more concrete plan is to come. It’s about what change can occur even after protests around the nation, including in Atlanta, come to a stop.                                                                                                                                                                    “It’s tough, because I don’t know the answers to the systemic change that we need and we’re all striving for,” Pierce said. “I do know it’s going to require appropriate education, it’s going to require more work than we’re seeing with the protesting by the individuals. I think the emotional side is now. The effort and the work ethic and everything that’s required to actually impact and create change is, what’s going to happen when the protest goes away? That’s education, as a young person. This isn’t taught in school. Systemic racism isn’t taught in school. There’s no class on this.”

That catch phrase, lifted from the erroneously reported Michael Brown incidents that took place in Ferguson, Mo., during the last phase of the Obama era, became a rally crying for the Black Lives Matter movement, But its phony admission of helplessness also sums up the noncommittal rhetoric that Spike Lee’s speciously political films (from _Do the Right Thing_ to _BlacKkKlansman_ ) have contributed to our culture. It is precisely because _Do the Right Thing_ never resolves either its characters’ personal conflicts or the audience’s social conflicts that the film is now misunderstood by desperate social-media commenters who have invoked _Do the Right Thing_ this week in the ongoing violent aftermath of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis.

"I honestly feel that if Mr. Gardner's dad would've kept his hands to himself, the incident would've never happened in the beginning," Scurlock's father, James Scurlock II, told CBS News affiliate KMTV. "Once again I ask that we investigate this and I ask my people to stand by me strong but do it peacefully."            In an interview on Tuesday with KMTV, Scurlock's mother said she feels broken over the death of her son, who she called "JuJu."             "He was vivacious. He lived life to the fullest. He was adventurous, he had such a big heart and was a momma's boy," she said.             Scurlock's brother, Nicholas Harden, said the loss is especially devastating because Scurlock had a newborn daughter.             "He has a heart of gold and anybody can tell you that," Harden said. "He was trying to protect people's lives. He was a hero. He has a daughter that is not even one and he changed his life around. He was settling down."            The family called for further investigation in the case and also urged protesters to remain peaceful, saying they don't want Scurlock's name to be used as a justification for violence.

Spike Lee has not yet made a film that comes close to explaining the festering anger that may define individual character. (Black Americans’ different ways of coping and persevering is August Wilson’s contribution to American literature.) Lee’s stump-speech movies merely specialize in the surface of complicated experience, which, as we now see, political opportunists can easily exploit. In light of recalling _Do the Right Thing_ , one Twitter sage added: “Black votes matter to many politicians — more so than black lives. That is why such politicians must try to keep black voters fearful, angry and resentful. Racial harmony would be a political disaster for such politicians.”

The expression of political attitudes is a specific feature of hip-hop culture. That’s why _Do the Right Thing_ , which is hip-hop’s cinematic keystone, appeals to current confusion. Radio Raheem (played by Bill Nunn), a looming, intimidating youth whose boombox blasting Public Enemy’s rhythmic alarms sets off the film’s tragic events, is Lee’s sacrificial figure. He has come to stand in for Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and now George Floyd even though he has little in common with them except death and martyrdom. Social-media evocations of Radio Raheem do not enhance Lee’s movie or add meaning to our ongoing nightmare.

COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted black Americans, infecting and killing them at higher rates across the nation. But experts say the pandemic has also exacerbated existing economic disparities and raised fresh concerns about the survival of black businesses, many of which have been the backbone of cities like Detroit and Atlanta for years.
 They also worry the pandemic could widen the existing black wealth gap. According to the Federal Reserve's 2016 Survey of Consumer Finance, the median white family net worth of $171,000 is about 10 times greater than that of a black family's, which is $17,150.
 Black businesses historically have struggled to gain access to financing due to discriminatory lending practices and a lack of relationships with big banks. But civil rights leaders and historians say their struggles are also rooted in the simmering effects of racism and Jim Crow-era laws that enforced racial segregation and denied black people equal opportunities.
 “Structural racism has created an environment where black businesses are starved for capital,” said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, a civil rights and urban advocacy organization.
 Juliet Walker, founder of University of Texas at Austin’s Center of Black Business, History, Entrepreneurship and Technology, said black enterprises existed even prior to the Civil War. They especially thrived during a “golden age” from 1900 to 1930 in areas such as Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District, known as Black Wall Street. But those moments were short-lived.
 Tulsa’s once-thriving African American business community was destroyed in 1921 when a racist white mob killed hundreds of black residents. Black residents attempted to rebuild in the decades that followed, only to see their work erased during urban renewal of the 1960′s.
 “Blacks were able to establish successful business enterprises during the age of slavery where black people had no political or economic rights,” Walker said. “Yet, here we are today and the position of blacks in business differs very little from the position of blacks during the age of slavery.”
 Detroit was once home to Black Bottom and Paradise Valley — two predominantly African American neighborhoods, the latter of which had more than 350 black- owned businesses and a music scene that drew the likes of Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday.

Police came and left without incident. But Ray said he could easily imagine a scenario where they believed the white woman, not the black man, and the situation deteriorated. “It ends with George Floyd,” he said.                                                       For many blacks, the line between police brutality and their sufferings in the COVID-19 pandemic is not a tenuous one. An Associated Press analysis of state and local data showed black Americans are dying at a far greater rate than would be expected, given their share of the population.                                                       Pre-existing conditions in the black population have been cited, but Ray said those conditions often can be blamed on circumstances beyond their control -- poverty, environmental ills, a lack of green space for exercise and of decent grocery stores that offer healthy foods.                                                       As “essential,” low-paid workers, they had to labor through the pandemic, often with little protection. But when they got sick, they were not so essential. A study found that black people seeking testing or treatment for COVID-19 were six times more likely to be turned away than whites, Ray said.

A lot of people are reading scientific papers for the first time these days, hoping to make sense of the coronavirus pandemic. If you’re one of them, be advised the scientific paper is a peculiar literary genre that can take some getting used to. And also bear in mind that these are not typical times for scientific publishing. It is hard to think of another moment in history when so many scientists turned their attention to one subject with such speed. In mid-January, scientific papers began trickling out with the first details about the new coronavirus. By the end of the month, the journal Nature marveled that over 50 papers had been published. That number has swelled over the past few months at an exponential rate, fitting for a pandemic. (Zimmer, 6/1)

Supporters of Brexit are determined there will not be a delay on the 31 December end to transition. That remains, firmly, the government's position.                                                                                                                                                             It can't simply play for time, and kick the can down Theresa May Boulevard, because the transition deal states that any delay has to be for at least two years. To Brexiteer Tory MPs, that's an impossibly high price for accepting an extension.                                                                                                                                                            Later this month, in a summit meeting, the two sides are scheduled to reflect on their negotiations and make a judgement as to whether it is worth continuing the effort to get a deal.                                                                                                                                                            And if they conclude there is not, those Brexiteers say: so be it - the UK would be trading with the European Union on what we have learned to call World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms. Mr Johnson calls them Australia-style terms. Either way, they are the WTO's least effective arrangements to ease trading.                                                                                                                                                            ## 'Johnny Foreigner'                                                                                                                                                            For now, there are two broad schools of thinking on this.  One embraces a future where Britain can shed Europe's environmental, social and labour rules, and become more competitive than the European Union. For them, sovereignty is all and compromise is for Johnny Foreigner.                                                                                                                                                            The other is aghast - looking at the unprecedented calamity that has struck the British, European and global economies due to Covid-19, and wondering how anyone could consider this a good time to take a risk on a full break from Europe's single market and customs union.                                                                                                                                                              Brexiteer outrider commentators are arguing that the Brexit pain won't feel so bad in the context of suffering something much worse.                                                                                                                                                             But from the academic network known as UK in a Changing Europe, there's been a reminder that their modelling suggests an economy that will grow 8.1% less in the next 10 years than it might otherwise be expected to do, while UK government modelling suggests a 7.6% shortfall.

The two most advanced vaccines in the running—Moderna’s and the Oxford vaccine—are entering into Phase II of the clinical trials stage, in which the vaccine goes from being tested on a small group of subjects to being tested on thousands of subjects. After Phase II, there will be one more phase of clinical trials to go, which will involve thousands of subjects to demonstrate its safety and efficacy. But clinical trials won’t be the most difficult part. Fauci said that the speed with which vaccines are coming to market can strain the production process, disrupting the economic models for manufacturing and funding. In order to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible, the governments will be investing in, and even paying, companies to make doses of vaccines that might never work. “The risk is not to the patients,” said Fauci. “The risk is to the investment.” He means that massive sunk costs in the past have deterred pharmaceutical companies from manufacturing vaccines.

The copper price is intrinsically linked to economic growth. Such growth drives increased demand for copper, which is an important component in everything from electricity generation and transmission, to transportation and communications. In the long term, there's logic in the rationale for copper price appreciation. Management predicts a shortfall in global copper supply in the coming decade, while electric vehicles and renewable power generation are expected to create a significant increase in demand.

"FIFA fully understands the depth of sentiment and concerns expressed by many footballers in light of the tragic circumstances of the George Floyd case," world football's governing body said in a statement.            After scoring in Dortmund's win at Paderborn on Sunday England winger Sancho lifted his shirt to reveal the message "Justice for George Floyd".            His team-mate Hakimi and McKennie expressed similar calls for justice, while Frenchman Thuram, the son of World Cup winner Lilian Thuram, took a knee after scoring for Gladbach in memory of Floyd.            - Racism 'unbearable' -

Anyone can be a pilot at the Hover Hawgs hovercraft park — well, those who are over 14 years old at least.                                    Bennie Forister and his wife Tanya opened the park, which allows those interested to fly and whir around a track on three acres, on May 8.                                    Forister said the couple was looking into starting a side business in the Black Hills. They started with researching campgrounds and cabin rentals, but thought it may be difficult to make a living with so many around.                                    “I started talking to the people coming into the Black Hills for vacation and the Sturgis Rally,” Forister said. “They were looking for things to do, things that were actually hands-on. You can only go see Mount Rushmore so many times.”

It's a concern for her now, too.             "You will have compounded health issues that go beyond COVID-19," she said.             Public health experts said it will take two to three weeks to know whether the protests cause a surge in coronavirus cases. And even then, they can't definitively tie it to the demonstrations.              The unrest is happening in tandem with the reopening of gyms, hair salons, restaurants, parks and beaches. It also comes on the heels of the Memorial Day weekend, when many people attended large gatherings, so experts already were bracing for a case increase, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University.            Dr. Ronald Hershow the director of the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Illinois-Chicago, and other experts noted that the racial disparities laid bare by coronavirus - with communities of color bearing a disproportionate burden of infections and deaths - overlap with the issues being protested on streets across America and around the globe.             "Racism kills," Hershow said. "Sometimes that's direct, as in the case of George Floyd. And sometimes it's through a virus like COVID-19."

Board newcomer Shurn is a former middle and high school English language arts teacher for St. Louis Public Schools. She currently holds the position of Wyman Wrap Around Services building director for the University City School District, where she is responsible for assessing student needs and addressing those needs by identifying community resources that will assist in student achievement.                            The 1996 Kirkwood High School graduate holds a B.S. degree in business marketing from Kentucky State University, a master’s in media communications from Webster University, and a master’s in secondary education. She has over 20 years of combined experience in the areas of nonprofit, education, corporate and entrepreneurship, and touts herself as the only candidate in the race with a background in education.                            “I strongly believe now more than ever we need a school board member who is currently working in education and understands what it will take to ensure that kids’ needs are being met when we come back to school,” Shurn said. “While we may not know what returning to school in the fall will look like, what I do know is that as an innovative thinker and a committed educator, students will always come first, with compassion, ethics and transparency leading the way — making this transition back to normal as comfortable and safe as possible.”                            As a Kirkwood school board member, Shurn said she will commit to fighting for academic excellence for all students. She said she would hold the district accountable for doing the work to close the achievement gap by evaluating the Kirkwood School District Task Force to Eliminate the Achievement Gap.                            “That was created in 2016 but has yet to be implemented, from talk to action,” she said.                            Shurn said she would work to ensure that social and emotional needs of students are being met.                            “Kirkwood loses one too many students every year to suicide, and some children in elementary schools are suffering from anxiety.

The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the sport's lawmakers, bans players from showing "any political, religious or personal slogans, statements or images".
            However, pointing to its own anti-racism campaigns, FIFA intimated that no action should necessarily be taken against Sancho, Hakimi or McKennie.            "The application of the laws of the game approved by the IFAB is left for the competitions organisers which should use common sense and have in consideration the context surrounding the events," FIFA said.            The DFB is investigating the players in line with IFAB's laws, although president Fritz Keller said he understood their actions.            "If people are discriminated against because of the colour of their skin, it is unbearable," said Keller.            "If they die as a result of the colour of their skin, then I am deeply disturbed. The victims of racism need all of our solidarity."            Sancho was booked after revealing the message to mark scoring against Paderborn, although the DFB has said the yellow card was actually because he lifted his shirt over his head.            "This is defined under rule number 12 as behaviour that is clearly against the rules and should be seen as independent of any political message," said Lutz Michael Froehlich, head of the elite referees unit of the DFB.            "For referees it is not possible to make a judgement during a match about political, religious or personal slogans, messages or pictures," Froehlich added.

It began the season in October with an international incident after a Houston Rockets executive expressed support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, causing a protracted debate over whether league executives and players caved to China’s anger over it.

New Zealand racing's greatest presenter thought he was blessed to be doing what he loved, bringing the emotion-charged stories of racing to the viewers.

On April 2, Bill Gates, who has invested $300 million into fighting the coronavirus, went on _The Daily Show._ After making a fortune as the creator of Microsoft, Gates and his wife Melinda have invested billions of dollars into public health efforts through the Gates Foundation. The Foundation has led a global effort that has helped immunize more than 700,000 million kids and saved an estimated 6 million lives. He explained that the US government’s response to the coronavirus should be analogous to how the government prepares for war. “Every state is being forced to figure things out on their own. It’s very ad hoc,” said Gates “It’s not like when a war comes, and we’ve done 20 simulations of various types of threats, and we’ve made sure that the training, communications, logistics, all those pieces fall into place very rapidly.”

_Do the Right Thing_ ’s legacy is based on exploiting racial disharmony and political disaster, which befits a misconceived _cri de coeur_. Today, Lee’s ideological knot puts a knot in one’s stomach. Looking for answers in that film does not help clarify this exasperating moment. For the liberal politicians who boast that they “stand shoulder-to-shoulder with protesters,” the advisory title _Do the Right Thing_ proves to be an impossibility.

The global race for a COVID-19 vaccine boils down to some critical questions: How much must the shots rev up someone’s immune system to really work? And could revving it the wrong way cause harm?
 Even as companies recruit tens of thousands of people for larger vaccine studies this summer, behind the scenes scientists still are testing ferrets, monkeys and other animals in hopes of clues to those basic questions — steps that in a pre-pandemic era would have been finished first.

MARSHFIELD - Aidan Connolly knows he's a pretty lucky young man. The Marshfield resident had the opportunity to play a sport that he loves for an extra season in high school and will get to do it for another four years in college, as well.            Connolly is the son of Marshfield High Hockey Coach Dan Connolly. After two years with the Rams playing for his father, Aidan decided to go the prep school route at Dexter Southfeld Academy and play another three years there before committing to play in college at Div. I's Sacred Heart University.            "It was totally worth it to be with my friends and go play hockey with them," Connolly said about his decision to leave Marshfield and go to Dexter. "Some of my friends got to play four years, but I was lucky enough to play five years" between the two schools.            "Coach MacDougall (whose family runs the junior team he played for) of the River Rats of Neponset Valley is someone I have a good relationship with. I am familiar with him and got to meet the coaching staff at Sacred Heart and they won the Connecticut Ice Tournament. They have been beating top 20 teams."            "The school has the majors and the minors that I am interested in. You are also close to New York if you want to work in the business world and I am close to home as well. It is in a good location and is good academically as well."            Before he gets ready to leave for Sacred Heart, Connolly will prepare this summer and continue his training as best that he can considering our current situation with the coronavirus pandemic.            Connolly will play at least one year of junior hockey for the Maine Nordiques out of Lewiston, Maine in the North American Hockey League and they will also play against United States Hockey League (USHL) teams as well.            "I have something to do each day as part of the workout plan that they sent me," Connolly said. "I signed a tender offer to play at Maine. I will run and sprint up hills, shoot pucks as many as 200 a day both heavy and regular pucks, ride the bike and play golf to relax some days in the morning."            "I'll be working out at the Boch Arena in Dedham and after that I will go downstairs with some Div. 1 players and skate."            Connolly is an active person who loved playing sports. He began skating when he was two and was always playing street hockey, whiffle ball or whatever sport was in season to stay active growing up.            "I always needed something to do to stay busy," Connolly said.            He was busy as far as decisions go as he climbed the ladder that eventually led him to Sacred Heart.            "Aidan will not start at Sacred Heart until the 2021-22 school year," his father Dan explained. "It is not a bad decision considering we do not know what will happen."            After a 57-point sophomore season where Connolly helped lead the Rams to the Super 8 tournament for the first time in program history, he had to make a decision about whether to stay at home or go to Dexter.            "It was a tough decision," Connolly said. "I could go to a prep school to play against 20-year-old players and play hockey with my friends or I could stay and play for my father who is a great coach. I took the path that I felt was best for me."            "He had two good years for us," Dan Connolly said. "We went to the Div. 1 South Finals and lost to Franklin and he was part of our Super Eight team as a sophomore but after that season he had a couple of options. He had some friends that were going to Dexter and he made the decision to go to play at a good school both athletically and academically.            "Aidan was always pushed in practice to play better," Dan said. "He had a linemate that was drafted and a defenseman that was drafted, but will go to play at Harvard."            Connolly had 43 points in his final season at Dexter and was part of three top-four Prep School hockey teams. He also played third base on the baseball team.
