Following a 35-point performance in a season-ending loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday, Memphis Grizzlies rookie point guard Ja Morant revealed that he played the final four games with a broken right thumb.
 "Since the Raptors game (on Aug. 9), I was out there playing with a fractured thumb," Morant told reporters after the loss, which gave the eighth-seeded Blazers the Western Conference's final playoff spot and sent the ninth-seeded Grizzlies home for the season.
 Morant, who turned 21 last week, has been playing with a brace on his right thumb, but he's still been productive.
 He averaged 18.3 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds per game over the final three seeding games, then set a career high with his 35 points Thursday. He also had eight assists and four rebounds against Portland, although he also set a career high with eight turnovers.
 The favorite to win Rookie of the Year, Morant finished the regular season averaging 17.8 points, 7.3 assists and 3.9 rebounds per game.
 The Grizzlies, who held a 3 1/2-game lead over the Blazers entering the season restart, finished 2-7 in the NBA bubble near Orlando, with injuries a significant factor.
 Beyond Morant's thumb, Memphis lost second-year big man Jaren Jackson Jr. to a torn meniscus in his knee after just three games in the bubble. Justise Winslow never made his debut after being acquired from Miami, sustaining a hip injury in practice in July that ended his season.
 "I'm proud of everybody: our whole staff, our players," Morant said. "I mean, we played through a lot of adversities. We faced injuries early in the season -- starting with me and then Brandon (Clarke) and then Jaren. Coming here, we still faced some injuries to some key guys on the team. But we never gave up. I'm proud of our fight."
 The Grizzlies finished 34-39 for the regular season prior to the play-in setback.

 Cubs starter Tyler Chatwood is on the shelf. The club placed the right-hander on the ten-day injured list with a mid-back strain, retroactive to August 13th. Chatwood was scheduled to pitch today but instead Kyle Hendricks will take the ball in Game one of a doubleheader against the Cardinals. In a corresponding move, the Cubs recalled right-hander Jason Adam from their alternate training site in South Bend, Indiana.

Over 640 liquor outlets belonging to the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC) re-opened in Chennai on Tuesday.
 Shamiyanas were erected in front of all shops, with barricades placed to ensure physical distancing. The city police had made elaborate arrangements to ensure law and order, and to prevent traffic congestions around the shops.
 “In shops on main roads we deployed teams headed by inspectors. In other areas, sub-inspectors headed the teams. They were assisted by personnel from the Armed Reserve and Home Guards,” said a senior police officer. “Circles were drawn to indicate physical distancing norms and barricades were placed to regulate the customers. The tokens were given 50 meters ahead of the shops,” said a police officer.
 At the Tasmac shop in Mylapore, customers started walking in to collect their coupons as early as 8 a.m. Hundreds of people were standing in queues at one shop while the police were monitoring them. Thavamani, who walked into the Mylapore outlet, said that all arrangements were in place to ensure physical distancing. “I was not wearing the mask properly. The staff and police chided me,” he said.
 At the Chepauk outlet, by 9.45 a.m., 200 coupons were issued but the shutters were down at the shop and the place wore a deserted look. The person-in-charge at this shop said that people came in and collected the tokens and will come back only after the shop opens at 10 a.m.
 A Tasmac shop employee in the city said that announcements were continuously made on the public address system to ensure customers wore masks and followed distancing rules. “Unlike the crowd witnessed in districts when Tasmac shops reopened, there is not much of a rush in the city as alcohol bottles were already available in the black market,” he said. Only 27 coupons were given at the shop on GP Road. Those who walked into purchase alcohol at the shop, spent only ₹100-₹150 on an average .
 By 11.30 a.m only select outlets in the city witnessed huge crowds, some of them throwing physical distancing to the winds, while all other shops hardly had 5-10 people standing in queues. “When shops opened up in neighbouring districts, people from Chennai went there and bought liquor and sold it within Chennai -- that’s one reason why there isn’t much of a crowd at most shops,” said a source in Tasmac.
 Meanwhile on Tuesday morning, Rajeshwari Priya of Anaithu Makkal Arasiyal Katchi staged a protest outside a Tasmac shop in Anna Nagar. She condemned the government’s decision to reopen the shops at a juncture when people had lost their jobs due to COVID-19. “I don't understand the urgency in opening the shops. Other districts were wary of people coming from Chennai as cases were so high,” she said. She courted arrest later and was detained at a wedding hall.
 On an average, the Chennai market brings in ₹12 crore to ₹15 crore per day to the State coffers. Tasmac, on an average, sells liquor worth over ₹130 crore to ₹140 crore per day across Tamil Nadu.

 # USPS is due for some changes
 Richard E. Asche, Port Orchard
 The fake media reports that President Trump is attempting to destroy the US Postal Service. That is an out and out lie! The recent media coverage regarding the US Postal Service has gotten far out of hand.
 You’ll have to admit that the postal service is in need of some needed repairs. Each day my daily mail box consists of at least 95% junk mail. I’d wager that yours does also! One possible solution is obvious and that is that the junk mailers have to pay more and the first class postage stamp has to cost less!
 Moreover, if voters ballots are to be returned through the postal system, then postage paid return envelopes must be provided to the voters, as they are in Washington State. If post office overtime is required to process the large number of anticipated ballots then so be it! Every business has peak periods when overtime is also required and they pay it.
 Finally, if further validation of the voters identity is needed on the ballot then how about the SSN last four digits?

With their offense back in a flow after a weekend just down the road, the Los Angeles Dodgers will try to solve their issues in home games Monday with the start of a brief two-game series against the Seattle Mariners.
 The game will mark the first matchup between Dodgers All-Star shortstop Corey Seager and his brother, Mariners All-Star third baseman Kyle Seager.
 The Dodgers are just 3-3 over their last six games at Dodger Stadium, but they stormed across town this past weekend with a three-game sweep over the Los Angeles Angels. The Dodgers hit four home runs Sunday and had seven in the series. Their 43 total homers lead baseball.
 The Mariners, meanwhile, were having a weekend to forget at Houston when they were swept in a three-game series. The Mariners lost the finale on Sunday when the Astros' Kyle Tucker hit a game-ending home run for a 3-2 Houston victory.
 The Mariners won the opener on their three-city road trip last Monday at Texas, but followed that with five consecutive defeats against the Rangers and Astros.
 The Mariners got the pitching they were looking for, holding the Astros to a combined five runs over the last two games, but they managed to score just three runs themselves in a pair of one-run defeats.
 "Losing 2-1 and 3-2 games against this team in this ballpark, you're disappointed you don't win those games," Mariners manager Scott Servais told reporters after Sunday's game. "We did a lot of good things on the pitching side the last couple nights. Unfortunately, they shut us down."
 Rookie right-hander Justin Dunn (1-1, 4.85 ERA) will try to help the Mariners stay effective from the mound when he starts Monday. The 24-year-old gave up two runs on seven hits over six innings on Aug. 10 at Texas to earn his first career victory.
 Another Mariners rookie, catcher Joseph Odom, had his first career hit Sunday, an RBI single in the third inning. He also scored a run.
 The Mariners are getting production from some of their younger players, with 73 of their 164 hits on the season from players 25 and younger. Kyle Lewis, who had two hits Sunday, is one of those, and has 27.
 The Mariners will be facing a mostly established roster in the series, but the Dodgers did celebrate some youth of their own Sunday. Catcher Keibert Ruiz hit a home run in his first career at-bat. Max Muncy, Corey Seager and Matt Beaty also hit home runs.
 Since returning from a lower back injury on Thursday, Corey Seager has three hits, with two of those home runs. Kyle Seager is 8-for-21 (.381) on the Mariners' road trip with a home run, and at 1,241 career hits, he is 14 shy of tying Jay Buhner for fourth most in Mariners history.
 Dodgers right-hander Ross Stripling (3-1, 3.97 ERA) will be on the mound Monday for the Dodgers. Stripling is coming off a loss to the San Diego Padres on Tuesday when he gave up six runs, but four of those were unearned. His own throwing error contributed to the slew of unearned runs.
 "You just didn't see that rhythm that he typically gets into, and the finish on a lot of his pitches ... (he) just didn't have that same finish that we're used to," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "There were some good throws in there."
 The Dodgers are 5-0-2 in their first seven series this season. They are 10-2 in road games but just 6-5 at home.

I fear that a kind of indifference has set into Americans’ hearts about abortion. We hear from abortion activists on both sides. But what about the rest of America? Some polls suggest the majority favors restrictions.
 We can do better than the current status quo. And somewhere in his heart, Joe Biden knows this, even as he trips over himself to utter every Planned Parenthood talking point there is.
 One recent Biden campaign video talks about his love for religious sisters. Here, too, he knows better than his actions. Catholic nuns have played a pivotal role in American history. And yet, these days, they are being persecuted. As you may have noticed, the Little Sisters of the Poor had to go to the U.S. Supreme Court not once, but twice because of the Obama-Biden administration. And back in the early days, behind the scenes, Biden was reportedly among those who advised against mandating that nuns cover contraception and abortion-inducing drugs in their employee insurance plans. But he gave in, and became a disingenuous mouthpiece — pretending there was no conscience problem at all — for the policy.
 When you talk about the battle for the soul of America, as Joe Biden does, we had better start reflecting on what the conscience of America looks like. Could it be that surrender to the tyranny of the abortion industry has something to do with all the violence, death and misery that we sometimes seem to be drowning in? There is a poison in our body politic. We need leaders who know this and can lead us to something better. Biden somewhere in there knows the truth — but he has forgotten, or chosen to ignore it.
 God help us all.

On the nose, you get some nice honey-sweet notes with a very solid dose of bright fruits (citrusy). Then the spice appears -- not so much baking spices as peppery rye-type spice, with maybe some distant nutmeg. I found the palate to be very mineral-y, which I generally like and also conjures the rugged Rockies. The rye pepper draws out the vegetal, alive nature of the fruits, which I'd describe as "papayo-mango salad with grapefruit squeezed on top." This is the part of the sip where you say to yourself, "There's _definitely_ no sugar added."

As the defending Stanley Cup champion St. Louis Blues get ready to face the Vancouver Canucks in Monday's Game 4 of their Stanley Cup playoffs opening- round series, it's with a renewed confidence.
 Thanks to Sunday's 3-2 overtime win, the Blues now trail only 2-1 and have a golden chance to draw even in the best-of-seven series.
 "We've got to keep on building," said Sunday's overtime hero, Brayden Schenn.
 "It's one win. It took a lot longer than we expected to get one, and we feel our qualifying round wasn't great, but each game we're getting better. Hopefully it's still a long series and we'll keep building our team game," Schenn said.
 The Blues, who sat atop the Western Conference when the league paused in March, lost their first five games after play resumed: all three round-robin clashes in the mini-tournament to decide their seeding position, and the first two of the series.
 While many teams would be feeling the noose tightening on them, the Blues responded with their best game since the restart, which may be a benefit of last year's run to the title.
 "Experience always helps," said forward Tyler Bozak. "We know a seven-game series is long. It's not over after two games. We knew we had to come out hard, have a big game and keep trying to wear them down.
 "They have a ton of skilled players that can make you pay and you've got to take away their time and space," Bozak said.
 Whether it's the same lineup Monday remains to be seen. The Blues turned to Jake Allen in goal over No. 1 netminder Jordan Binnington, and Allen responded with 39 saves.
 Coach Craig Berube wouldn't say who will be in net in the next game, nor whether he will have veteran forwards Vladimir Tarasenko and Alexander Steen back in action after both were unfit to play.
 The Canucks saw their five-game winning streak snapped, but they remain in the driver's seat with a reminder of what they must do to win.
 "We have to come at them right off the start, get on them early, and play our game," said captain Bo Horvat. "A couple of times, we were shying away from who we are, our identity, and I think if we get back to that, we'll have success.
 "They're the defending Cup champs for a reason, they know what it takes to win, and they don't shy away from a fight. It was a good hockey game. It was fast, and I thought we matched them well. Unfortunately, we weren't on the right end of it. I can't wait to play them tomorrow," Horvat said.
 Coach Travis Green said his team was guilty of more turnovers than usual, especially in the neutral zone, a factor in preventing the Canucks from generating momentum and scoring chances with their forecheck.
 "We were a shot away from winning the game. Had some good looks. Back at it tomorrow," Green said, keeping an even keel.
 "This has been a tight series. ... Whatever happens in any game, win or lose, enjoy it or dwell on it for a little bit and then park it. I think the best part about tonight's result is we get back at it, and the guys are excited to play again (Monday)."
 Even though he faced 49 shots, Jacob Markstrom is expected to stay in net for Vancouver. Green had no update on the status of defenseman Tyler Myers, who left in the third period of Friday's clash after being hit by Schenn headfirst into the boards.

FAIRMONT — The handful of additional 100-yard jogs by a couple of North Marion linemen at Monday's first official practice weren't because they needed the extra conditioning, North Marion 12-year coach Daran Hays said, it was simply because the spot they set their water bottles were at one of Roy Michael Field, while the majority of their drill work was at the other.
 "Every time we hit water, they have to go to their station — their station might be 100 yards away, it might be 20 yards away, it might be 5, but they're all spread out and it gets them away from each other," Hays said.
 There were a total of seven separate water stations designated by Hays and his NMHS coaching staff, he said, that split up the 45 or so players at the Huskies' opening practice on Monday into smaller groups. "I think we came up with a great plan," Hays said.
