It’s part of Amazon’s industry warehouse and distribution strategy to keep pace with fast-paced shipping.
 In the past, private business offered much of the service, with Amazon creating standards for them to follow. The business model they created for others has been more successful than they ever imagined.
 So much so, they recently announced they want to claw back a large share of that business, mostly by creating Amazon Prime.
 The Last Mile Distribution Center is key. It’s a place where small quantities of product that fly off the shelf, so to speak, remain on hand for instant deliveries.
 It’s the final stop before the package is placed on your doorstep.
 Goods are created somewhere; packaged elsewhere to Amazon’s specifications to avoid damage and returns, transported to massive fulfillment centers, then transported to regional hubs.
 The airport in Lakeland is the hub for Florida.
 After that, they are sent to large million-square foot distribution centers. There are about seven in Florida around cities like Pensacola; Jacksonville has three; Miami; Orlando and Tampa.
 From there, they are sent to smaller — about 100,000 square foot Last Mile Distribution Centers like the one being built in Venice.
 Last Mile centers are typically near an airport and always on a major transportation artery — like Interstate 75, Sarasota-Bradenton International and Punta Gorda Airport.
 According to Amazon, the final delivery destination is typically a personal residence. The focus of last mile logistics is to deliver items to the end user as fast as possible.
 Permitting for the Venice Last Mile Distribution Center has been underway for several months. No less than 15 permits and reviews were conducted. The last one, a building plan review, was scheduled to be completed on Jan. 18.
 Amazon is being tight lipped about when the center will open.

In his latest objection, Newsom expressed frustration that PG&E hasn’t budged much since he sent that letter nearly six weeks ago despite further talks with representatives from his office. “He is clearly not happy with what has been going on behind closed doors, and he is trying to telegraph that to Judge Montali,” said University of California Hastings College of the Law professor Jared Ellias, who has been closely following the PG&E case.

Chicago is widely known as the "windy city" but the California city of Palm Springs has been benefiting from its Santa Ana winds since 1982, when the first wind farm was built in the San Gorgonio Pass.      Coming from Los Angeles, travelers will find thousands of turbines -- about 4,000 -- on both sides of Interstate 10. Driving by, the energy producing "windmills" look big, but travelers can't really get a handle on how big until standing next to one. Some of the blades are more than half the size of a football field, standing about 150 feet tall. At the top, the turbines have a generator that weighs in at 30,000 to 45,000 pounds.      The wind farm provides enough energy to power Palm Springs and the entire Coachella Valley. It is quite a sight, and to get an understanding of how it all works, take a wind farm tour. Best of the Best Tours offers tours with knowledgeable guides -- a lot more fun than science class. For information and to purchase tickets visit thebestofthebesttours.com.      Palm Springs is also known for its movie history. Many famous people lived in this valley, including Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, Tony Curtis, Sandra Dee, Gene Autry, Cary Grant, Elvis and so many more. It was where they escaped to enjoy privacy and relaxation. Today's stars who can be seen in the area include Leonardo DiCaprio, Suzanne Somers, Barbra Streisand and James Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt and President Obama and family.      History walking tours are offered through the Palm Springs Historical Society for those interested in the homes of the stars and architecture. Visit pshistoricalsociety.org. Best of the Best Tours also offers a Rich and Famous Tour that includes homes to the stars.      This valley of 48,000-plus residents offers a large variety of entertainment, from theaters, concerts and plays to horseback riding and snowshoeing. Yes, this warm, sunny, palm-tree-lined city offers winter sports. Take a short tram ride up the mountain -- 8,516 feet -- to Mount San Jacinto State Park, where residents and visitors take part in winter sports and camping, hiking and guided nature walks in the summer. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway takes riders high above the valley to the snow-capped mountains. At the top of the mountain, visitors will find Peaks Restaurant. It offers beautiful views of the Coachella Valley and good food. Also at the top is Pines Cafe, a cafeteria-style restaurant, and the Lookout Lounge, offering alcoholic beverages and appetizers.      The tram itself is an experience. It rotates as travelers ascend and descend the mountain to take in all the views of the valley and the mountains. The first tram was completed in 1963, but a project was completed in 2000 that added new cars and renovated the facilities. It is known as the world's largest rotating tramcar system ever constructed. Visit pstramway.com for details on the tram rides, dining and activities.      For more information on lodging, dining and more go to visitpalmsprings.com.

While strong on personal details, these biographies can be unsatisfying at times. Too often Spiegel dashes past Lumet's films and doesn't ponder some of his more consequential partnerships, such as the one with Sean Connery, his star in five films. The reasons for Lumet's artistic stumbles -- the musical "The Wiz" and the Western love story "Lovin' Molly" come to mind -- are often unexplored. Spiegel's nonlinear approach to relating events fosters repetition and tests a reader's patience.

When some executives reach the top, they take a moment to enjoy the view. Not Lucian Grainge. In 2011, less than a year after he was named chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, he led the company into one of the biggest deals in music business history by acquiring EMI's recorded-music division -- home to artists ranging from the Beatles to Katy Perry. It was a blockbuster $1.9 billion transaction that vaulted UMG far into the lead as the world's largest music company. In the years that came after, Grainge continued to double down, building the company into a titan unprecedented in the music business. Among the acts represented via five anchor labels -- Capitol, Def Jam, Interscope- Geffen-A&M, Island and Republic -- are Taylor Swift, Drake, U2, The Weeknd and Sam Smith, as well as iconic heritage acts like the Rolling Stones, Elton John, Chuck Berry and the Motown catalog.

The Psychedelic Furs, to April Blackwood Music. I loved them. There was one defining song — with a new act, there’s usually one song that you sign them on, when you’re a kid, anyway. Theirs was this hypnotic song, “Sister Europe.” I had this beat-up old Mini that I used to drive to their gigs, and I put a [big bumper sticker] on the back of it that said “Psychedelic Furs.” It was probably there for two years — I was such an idiot, so uncool (Laughs). But when you’re a young A&R, you’re one of the fans as well as having a professional relationship.

"The ties that bind" have long provided a rich well of inspiration for storytellers to draw from, but in 2019, family-born of blood or built from scratch--is the backbone of almost all of the year's Oscar-nominated screenplays. Some of them, like Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's "Little Women," reinforce and celebrate the essential need for those homegrown support systems. Others, like Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood," pay tribute to the nourishing bonds of friendship that sustain individuals in times of personal crisis or doubt. And still others, like Rian Johnson's wickedly clever "Knives Out," gleefully uncover the fault lines that divide family members during tragedies ostensibly meant to bring them together. Starting from a blank page or previously existing material, working in comedy or searing drama, these screenplays transform identifiable relationships into unforgettable stories, and then elevate those stories to universal truths.

The city of Fort Oglethorpe has approved an amendment to the engineering contract for its planned walking trail project along West Chickamauga Creek.


  During the Jan. 13 City Council meeting, Public Works Director Jeff Long explained the amendment and the project, which has been in the works for almost four years.


  “This request is for the engineering services for CTI Engineers for amendment number three of the original agreement from March 28, 2016,” Long said. “This will not exceed $10,000.


  "With this amendment, we’re working on a GDOT (Georgia Department of Transportation) grant on the walking trail. It’s getting close to the final stages and the projected bid is now June of this year. Believe it or not, we’re getting there.”


  Long said that since the project hasn’t progressed as originally planned, the amendment will include NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) assessment reevaluation required by GDOT, as well as additional planned revisions. The NEPA assessments are required for federal-aid projects.


  Long added that cost was a factor in the project stalling over the past couple of years.


  “Part of this design was along Frank Lane for a pedestrian bridge that was outside the GDOT range,” Long said. “We cut out the original one that was in the GDOT right-of-way due to the cost of design and all – it was going to cost several hundred thousand dollars to do that, so we pulled it out and we’re going to detour around out of the right-of-way.”


  Though he didn’t disclose an estimated cost for the total project, Long did say funding for the project will come out of the 2019 Catoosa County SPLOST (Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax).


  Before a vote was taken, Councilman Derek Rogers asked Long give a little more information on the plan for the project to better educate the public.


  “For those interested, could you just explain where that goes,” Rogers asked.


  “Yes, it’ll start here at South Cedar Lane, go across the school properties, and then down to Frank Lane,” Long said. “It’ll cut up – we’re working with the property owners there about getting it just off the right-of-way. It will tie into the walking trail that goes around O’Charley’s and toward Panera Bread there along the creek and the canoe launches.”


  Ultimately, the board unanimously approved the engineering amendment by way of a 5-0 vote.


  Afterwards the vote, Mayor Earl Gray said he’s pleased to see the project finally headed toward fruition.


  “It’s been four years in the making, it’s time to get it done,” Gray said.

Ten days later, de Becker was advised by a “leading intelligence expert” to conduct a forensic analysis of Bezos’ iPhone and to look for Saudi fingerprints in the hack, according to notes in the report. The report did not identify the intelligence expert who reached out to de Becker.
 De Becker, who declined to comment, hired FTI Consulting on Feb. 24, 2019, to examine Bezos’ phone. FTI was initially asked to look into several text messages that Bezos had received from the WhatsApp account of the Saudi prince. In mid-May 2019, Bezos handed over his iPhone X and asked FTI to run a full analysis on it, according to the report.
 FTI zeroed in on an April 2018 dinner in which Crown Prince Mohammed and Bezos had exchanged phone numbers in Los Angeles. After that, FTI found, the WhatsApp account of the prince initiated contact with Bezos repeatedly and without prompting.
 The May 2018 message that contained the innocuous-seeming video file came out of the blue, the report said. In the 24 hours after it was sent, Bezos’ iPhone began sending large amounts of data, which increased approximately 29,000% over his normal data usage.
 In additional notes to the report, which were obtained by The New York Times, investigators said several phone apps were being used during the time that data was leaving the phone. Those included the Safari web browser and the Apple Mail program, both of which Bezos did not appear to be using heavily himself. Bezos did not have iCloud backup enabled on the phone, the notes added, which would have also explained large amounts of data leaving the phone.
 Messages sent by Crown Prince Mohammed’s WhatsApp account starting in late 2018 soon began to suggest that the sender had intimate knowledge of Bezos’ private life. On Nov. 8, 2018, the report said, Bezos received a message from the account that included a photo of a woman resembling Sanchez.
 The photo was captioned, “Arguing with a woman is like reading the software license agreement. In the end you have to ignore everything and click I agree.”
