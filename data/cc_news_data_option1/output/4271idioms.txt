No, I think that's a good summary. And I think it would be difficult to pay a number, I think. We're working with the same interest rate environment and we'll take advantage of the opportunities to improve the mix and cost of deposits through our business initiatives. And then as Jared mentioned, I think the loan pricing and the loan structure is important. And then, obviously, in a rising rate environment, we'd expect stronger earnings growth, which would help with NIM expansion as well. But all things being equal, I think we're still on a good position there have some improvement there.

Both candidates said their priorities include quality service and the health and welfare of firefighters and that they intend to make Boise fire chief their last job before retiring. Additionally, both said they're in favor of pursuing electric fire engines, an initiative that was spearheaded by former chief Dennis Doan, who resigned his position earlier this year amid pressure from McLean.
 Sheppard, who was first to speak, highlighted his intention to serve the community's interests by engaging with groups and residents — he shared his personal phone number as a show of his commitment to be available "24/7." Sheppard also suggested that he would seek out new technologies to improve fire service and decrease costs.
 "We're stronger as a community and bringing technologies on board that will enhance our ability to serve the public is really what I would love to bring to Boise," he said.
 Sheppard served more than 20 years in the U.S. Air Force before working for the fire department in Oakland, California, for nearly two decades. In 2014, he became fire chief in Richmond, a city of about 110,000 people within the San Francisco Bay Area.

Looking to further boost an economy that has added back tens of thousands of jobs since April but has a long way to climb out of the hole dug by the pandemic, Gov. Charlie Baker rolled out a multi-pronged strategy Thursday to infuse small businesses and workforce training programs with new money to cover payroll, rent, protective equipment and other expenses.
 The economic stimulus strategy comes as Baker and Beacon Hill Democrats continue to criticize and wait for Congress to deliver additional relief, aid that the governor reiterated Thursday is still needed.
 "To be clear, there's no substitute for the size and scope that a federal aid package could deliver. But that doesn't seem to be in the offing and we certainly don't believe that we can wait," Baker said at a State House press conference, where he also nudged the Legislature to finalize a $275 million borrowing bill that would invest in affordable housing, tourism and other economic development needs.
 The newest component of Baker's plan, he said, is $115 million in initiatives that include a $50.8 million grant program for small businesses who have been hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. Baker said the grants would be made available quickly - officials described a three-week application period - to support small businesses hurt by the pandemic, train workers in growth areas like manufacturing, subsidize internet for low-income residents and support community efforts to create new opportunities for commerce.
 Some business groups, like the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, were already encouraging members to apply quickly, though Baker said the money would be more targeted than prior investments, and not dispersed first come first serve.
 The grants will be made available through the Massachusetts Capital Growth Corp., and businesses with 50 or fewer employees will be eligible to receive up to $75,000 or up to three months of supported expenses for employee payroll and benefit costs, mortgage interest, rent, utilities and interest on other debt obligations.
 Businesses with five or fewer employees may access up to $25,000 to cover business costs like rent, staffing, and utilities, or to purchase personal protection equipment.
 "Small businesses can apply now, that means now," Baker said.
 The money for the grants is being drawn from the state's allocation from the Coronavirus Relief Fund approved by Congress and federal community development block grants, but to fully execute his plan, the governor will need help from the Legislature, which has been mostly dormant since July.
 Baker said the $115 million in new funding is part of a larger $775 million strategy to bolster economic growth, some of which had already been announced or proposed in the governor's revised fiscal 2021 budget plan, and at least $175 million of which requires legislative approval.
 The full plan includes the governor's $171 million eviction diversion program announced on Oct. 12, and the $100.7 million small business recovery plan that he included as part of his revised budget, and proposed funding through an accelerated sales tax collection reform.
 "The plan, we believe, can help stabilize in many parts of the commonwealth growth that's already started to take place and hopefully kick start it in other parts of the state as well," Baker said.
 The repackaging of earlier proposals and the spotlight put on programs that are already part of the state's economic development work created some confusion among legislators about what was new, what required their approval and what, if any, spending had been crowded out to make room for the administration's new program.
 For instance, Baker said $323 million in existing capital program funding would be directed toward "doing more of what works."
 Baker said, "The sources and uses chart on this is complicated," describing a "a giant quilt of funds coming from a whole bunch of places."
 In addition to the $50.8 million grant program, new investments announced Thursday include another $10 million for the Shared Street and Spaces program, which has been used to facilitate activities like outdoor dining; $10 million for local recovery planning grants, $10 million to support museums, theaters and other cultural facilities, and $8.3 million in small business technical assistance to help businesses access grant programs and loans.
 On the workforce front, Labor Secretary Rosalin Acosta said that from April through August the state's economy has added back 270,000 private sector jobs, or 41 percent, but unemployment remains at 9.6 percent, and many people have left the workforce altogether.
 "We still have a long way to go in order to achieve full employment," Acosta said.
 A new pot of $25 million announced Thursday for workforce supports included $10.4 million to expand partnerships with large employers and align job training and employment pathways, $9.2 million to subsidize internet for low- income residents and expand broadband hotspots in underserved communities, $3.2 million to connect unemployment benefit recipients with MassHire job search supports, $2 million to buy a standardized virtual manufacturing job training program, and $300,000 to augment the governor's budget request of $8.4 million for career technical institutes.
 All of these investments are being made as House and Senate leaders begin to weigh Baker's $45.5 billion budget proposal for fiscal 2021, and negotiations over a biennial jobs bill drag on into the fall.
 Baker said his administration continues to have "discussion and collaboration" with lawmakers over the bill, and hopes to see it finalized soon.
 "We look forward to seeing that one get done so that we can add it to the tools in the toolbox to continue to help people find their way back to productive employment or sustained employment they managed to put together, post spring," Baker said.
 The governor said he's aiming to put most of the money in his $775 million recovery plan to work soon. "If all goes according to plan, a lot of this will be out of the door before the end of the calendar year," he said.
 As Baker tried to put the focus on economic recovery Thursday, the state continued to see a surge in COVID-19 transmission, with 986 new confirmed cases reported and 30 new deaths.
 Just a day earlier, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced that the city's schools would retreat and move to 100 percent remote learning until it saw transmission rates start to recede again.

But we are bringing on loans at good yields, and it's hard to know exactly where it's going to end up. Because I would say that in this environment, because we're focused on quality, we're likely to go after the highest quality loans, which may mean that we're going to protect -- which may have a lower yield. I just think given the visibility down the road in terms of the economy and credit, if we're going to bring on loans and we're going to grow, we want to do the safest type of loans right now.

The computer technicians of the Cumberland County school system are accustomed to making things work.
 They keep more than 13,000 connected devices up and running during the school year. They have undertaken projects to upgrade internet connectivity within schools. They have helped put a device in the hands of every student from the fifth grade through high school.
 This year, they were facing a tall order. In July, the decision was made to offer a virtual attendance option for students amid the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic.
 “It’s like we’ve had to reinvent the wheel,” said Kim Hassler. “And our job is not just in one box. We have to be willing to cross boundaries into other areas.”
 They helped set up temperature scanning machines — new technology they had never worked with.
 “Instantly, everyone starts pulling together,” Hassler said of the team of nine technicians and supervisor Elbert Farley. “We don’t allow the frustration to grab ahold of us. We just pull together.”
 That included getting laptops ready to go home with students, helping teachers get their classrooms set up for virtual learning and putting together new, unfamiliar equipment.
 The school system has several models of Chromebooks, each with a different charger. The team had to unwire carts where the laptops were stored at the elementary schools and match up those chargers to the proper device.
 At the high school, Chromebooks are assigned to specific students, and they keep the same one during their four years. Those had to be distributed.
 The Chromebooks require a Cumberland County school system email address. During the virtual learning orientation sessions, the techs were on hand to make sure everyone had the right Chromebook and that their username and passwords were up to date.
 That’s on top of the other work they do throughout the year, wiring schools, installing security systems, and general repairs. They outsource very little repair work.
 The techs have been providing support to parents and students learning at home, which is a new experience.
 “When it’s hands on, you can do what you need to do, but talking someone through the process can be difficult,” said Chris Miller.
 Chromebooks aren’t the most durable of laptops. The techs have seen any number of damaged computers they need to repair quickly so students can get back online and learning.
 “I’m robbing Peter to pay Paul,” said Joey Burnett of the spare parts available.
 Some laptop functions had been blocked when the computers were used primarily at school, like the cameras. But remote learning requires a functional camera. Hester said when they unblocked the cameras, some no longer worked.
 The school system will soon get a delivery of about 1,200 laptops, the yearly order for the one-to-one technology initiative launched four years ago. This will provide enough laptops for every student in the fifth through 12th grades.
 Federal CARES Act funds were also designated to purchase additional laptops for younger students. Farley said manufacturers are having trouble meeting skyrocketing demand for laptops as schools nationwide go to virtual learning, so that order may not arrive until April.
 Farley said other school systems are experiencing similar problems.
 They’ve helped to reassure teachers and help them configure their classrooms for virtual learning.
 “You make sure the virtual student can see the teacher, hear the teacher,” Hassler said.
 She and Tabitha Webb encouraged teachers to play the role of a student in the classroom, and walk around the classroom to see how far they could be from a microphone.
 She said many teachers were overwhelmed.
 “We finally set the computer on a desk and told them that was the student,” she said. “That helped calm some of them down.”
 And with so many devices and so many virtual learners, there isn’t a lot of time to spend with any one issue. They need to fix what they can and move on to the next problem.
 A common problem is slow internet at home.
 “Most of my problems from the home is internet being slow,” said Donnie Melton.
 The lessons have videos that require a fast internet connection, or it can cause lagging, buffering or it just won’t play. That’s compounded with additional learners in the home trying to be online at the same time.
 The techs do what they can, checking the home internet speeds.
 “When the speed comes back slow, we can’t do anything about that,” he said.
 Josh Hesser said, “It’s just out of our control.”
 But the department has completed several projects at the schools that have helped ensure adequate bandwidth from the school site.
 “We have wired every one of our buildings ourselves,” Farley said. At Stone Memorial High School, that work saved about $100,000. “They do a heck of a job doing that. I’d put them up against anyone.”
 Hesser said much of their ability to respond to the COVID-19 crisis was due to Farley’s vision of equipping schools with better wifi and pursuing a one-to- one technology initiative.
 “We’re in a lot better shape than we would have been a few years ago,” he said.
 The schools use ENA for its internet service. They installed commercial-grade wireless routers in every classroom that not only handle school devices, but all the phones coming into the schools.
 A new wireless antennae at the Cumberland County High School field house has allowed better internet to serve that facility.
 Hassler said, “I was impressed with the pre-planning.”
 When schools shut down last March, the techs were at the schools making sure outside signals would be accessible. They charted which parking spaces could handle people being online.
 “We always have to consider plan B,” she said. “Thank goodness we didn’t have to use that, but we were ready.”
 Farley, during a meeting of his staff in early October, said, “I can’t say how proud I am of you.”
 Other members of Central Services popped their head into the meeting — a rarity as the techs primarily stay at their schools taking care of work orders — to offer their thanks, as well.
