PLYMOUTH - The summer between junior and senior year is a crucially important time for a high school student. It's when you have the free time to visit a college campus or two, do some research on prospective colleges and begin to set down the path that will lead you into your adult life.
 If you're an elite athlete looking for the right place to continue on that road the summer before your senior year is also huge. It's the time when you want the most college eyes on you. You play in the Bay State Games, go to every possible invitational tournament, write multitudes of emails, send out highlight videos of your top plays and basically do whatever you possibly can to get the attention of the college coach of your choice.
 At least that's the game plan. But then you throw in the travel and safety restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and as they say, game plans sometimes change. Actual in-person visits by prospective athletes are replaced by virtual online school tours as well as Zoom calls with college coaches and their staffs.
 Plymouth North's Cam Shaughnessy and Plymouth South's Hunter Dean are both rising seniors. They compete against each other on the football field as well as the basketball court but one big thing they share together is the drive to play sports at the next level. Shaughnessy wants to play football while Dean hopes to continue to play both football and baseball or stick with one sport at a higher college level.
 Both young men say that they are willing to take their time while doing their homework about which college path is best for them.
 "The Zoom calls have been interesting. You need to come to the interviews prepared and know what questions you have for a coach when you get them on a call," said Dean, who has already talked with Bentley University, Franklin Pierce and Worcester State among other colleges. "I talk with the schools about where they see me fitting into their program. I've also watched a lot of virtual campus tour videos about the things that their school can offer, both for athletics and academics."
 While it's hard for the videos to replace the actual feel of being there in person on a college campus, Dean said they do offer a flavor of what he'd be walking into if he chose to attend there.
 Dean's now up to 6-foot-6, 220 pounds and has been working out with Atlantic Sport Performance to improve his strength and speed. He also hopes to get in some time on the diamond this summer with the Ocean State Makos AAU baseball team and play in a 7v7 football league as the Panthers prepare to defend their Patriot League title this fall.
 In baseball he plays first base and is growing by leaps and bounds as a right- handed pitcher. Dean was also the starting quarterback on last year's South football team that made it all the way to the Div. 4 Super Bowl title game.
 "I've got a good idea of what I'm looking for in a college," said Dean, an outdoor enthusiast who wants to major in Environmental Science. "I'd like to find a place where I can still play baseball and football unless I have to choose just one to play at a higher level. I'm looking for somewhere that's more of a small town rather than a big city. I'm also looking for a school that has a nice weight room and a place where I get a good connection with the athletic program."
 Across America's Hometown, you'll usually find Shaughnessy lifting heavy things in the weight room he has in the garage of his house or on the football field at Plymouth North working on his speed and agility.
 Shaughnessy has started on the offensive and defensive line for the Blue Eagles. He's looking to play nose guard or defensive tackle at the next level and at 6'3, 291 pounds with good hands and quick feet that come from his basketball training Shaughnessy checks a lot of boxes that college coaches are looking for in new recruits.
 What he's doing has worked so far as the 6'3, 291 pound lineman already has Division 1 college offers in hand from Air Force as well as Army-West Point. He was invited to attend a prospect camp with Boston College as a junior and has also had Zoom interviews with several other schools.
 "You want to get a flavor of the school campus by being there in person and walking around. That's tough to do from a video tour," Shaughnessy said. "But the Zoom calls with the coaches and the recruiters are good in that you can ask a lot of questions about the philosophy of the program, find out what their training facilities are like as well as where they see you fitting into the big picture.
 "It a process, so you want to take some time and do all your homework and look at all your options before you make a final decision on a college. I'm not going to rush the process. You have to take your time because that's where you are going to spend the next four years of your life," Shaughnessy said. "My parents (Dan and Lynn) have been awesome with helping me go through everything as we work to find the right fit for me."
 Alison Foley has been on both sides of the recruiting process for a while now. The Plymouth native spent 22 years as the winningest head coach in the history of the women's soccer program at Boston College and now helps guide talented athletes and their families through the recruiting process with her business, Foley Athletic Advising.
 "The college search process is different these days (with the Coronavirus pandemic) but it can still work on both ends, for the coach and the player, if it's done right," Foley said. "What a player does during something like COVID-19 as far as their training can actually tell a coach something about them in how well they can handle things when they don't go as planned and how they can adapt when some adversity is put in front of them."
 Foley's biggest suggestion to athletes preparing for the Zoom calls with prospective colleges is to "treat it like a job interview, because that's exactly what it is. Dress appropriately, be professional and above all you want to do your homework before you get on the call so you don't take up time asking questions that could easily be found on the college's website. Coaches will notice how prepared you are and appreciate that you took an interest in finding those things out.
 "Research the school and the athletic program you have an interest in to find out what they are all about," Foley added. "Ask the coach in-depth questions about their coaching philosophy, what their training set-up is like, what kind of academic support they have for their athletes as well as where they see you fitting into their program."
 Shaughnessy and Dean will have no bigger supporters in the college search process than their high school coaches as they navigate the sometimes choppy waters to their next destination.
 Plymouth South baseball coach Walter Fust said Dean "is just starting to reach his potential" on the diamond. "He's a high-ceiling player that has everything a college baseball coach is looking for on the field as well as off the field. Hunter's got tons of talent and he's a natural leader. Teammates are drawn to him as a team leader with the hard work he puts into everything.
 "Hunter was going to do a lot more pitching for us this spring (before the season was canceled) and I think he learns more about being a pitcher each day. He can throw in the mid-80's and he'll only improve with experience," Fust said. "The only thing that kept me from using him more as a pitcher before now is that he's an exceptionally good defensive first baseman and he was the key to our defense. He's got great footwork around the bag and he is really growing into his size."
 Incoming Panthers Head Football Coach Darren Fruzetti knows Dean very well from his time as offensive coordinator for the program.
 "We put him in at quarterback as a sophomore when Keven Paul was injured and Hunter took on the challenge," Fruzetti said. "Like they say, you can't teach size and athleticism and he has both of them. Hunter puts in the work and he gets better every day at things like reading defenses and anticipating what kind of schemes they are going to throw at him.
 "Hunter's growing into the job of being a starting quarterback and he has all the intangibles with the kind of work he puts in and the way his teammates naturally rally around him as a leader."
 Plymouth North Head Football Coach Chris Whidden said Shaughnessy has taken a liking to playing on the defensive side of football and college coaches are going to appreciate the total package that he could potentially bring to their program.
 "Cam has the size and agility to play at any level and the time he's spent playing basketball has given him great hand technique and footwork and strong overall athleticism. And when coaches talk to him they'll find out what a great kid he is," Whidden said. "He's a natural leader, a hard worker and his head is in the right place. He checks all the boxes."

With the start of 2000, I had the good fortune to get hired by Advanced Business Systems, a company founded in the 1960s by Jack Mehner and then transitioning to his younger brother, Mark. They treated me very well and taught me how to sell business phone systems. In the end, I was not a successful phone system salesman in the post-Y2K environment, so I moved on to Southwestern Bell working as a service representative at its Cape Girardeau call center. My training class was the last one hired before 9/11/01.

“Well, how do you get the light to come out of the big barrel in the cave?”
 As David sat there trying to figure that out, Jennie told of how Amy also had claimed that a light came out of the barrel.
 David and Jennie dismissed the whole affair. They had found other times when one of the children had come up with a whopper and the other would pick up on it.
 The following fall Jennie was making some of her homemade vegetable soup. She was out of tomatoes so she went to the cave to get some that they had wrapped in newspaper and stored on the shelves. She entered the cave, lit a candle and walked to the far end where the tomatoes were. She set the candle on the shelf slightly to her right and started to unwrap the tomato. At first, the shadow she cast on the row of tomatoes in front of her didn’t enter her mind. Suddenly she wondered how she could be making a shadow in front of her when the candle was way off to the side.
 She turned around and immediately remembered Amy’s tall tale about the light coming from the barrel. An intense white light was coming out of a small hole in the end of one of the barrels. It shone like a pencil of fire against the opposite wall. There the light fell on the pile of fruit jars and reflected light all over the room. The novelty of seeing the whole room lit up momentarily caught her attention. It was, however, for only a moment. Her astonishment quickly turned to fear. She knew there was no possible explanation for that intense light to be coming out of that dusty old barrel whose only access was a small hole in the end and a wooden faucet near the bottom.
 That fear grew inside her like a giant, cold animal until she was so terrified that she could only mouth the screams that wouldn’t come out of her throat. She couldn’t scream and she couldn’t move. She felt that her chest was in a vise and she couldn’t even breathe. For what seemed like an eternity, she stood with her back to the shelf. Finally, almost without knowing it, she mustered the courage to run out of the cave. As she came the door, she found her voice and screamed in terror.
 David was just coming from the barn and rushed to her to see what the problem was. By now, she had been sobbing uncontrollably. Thinking of his wife’s fear of snakes, he grabbed a stick and ran into the cave. When he opened the door, the soft light from Jennie’s candle revealed nothing nothing out of the ordinary except that the wine barrel was completely covered with a thick white frost. David has to touch the frost, hardly believing his eyes. How can heavy frost form in a cave on a warm fall day? Where did the light come from? Neither David nor Jennie knew.
 David bricked up the doorway and chinked the cracks. He hitched up the team to a slip and scrapped dirt down over the entrance. Without a word, he worked until a mound of dirt stood where that cave had been.
 Somewhere north of Keokuk is a cave containing some fruit long since rotted away, some old jars, a burnt-out candle, and two wine barrels.
 Is there a light inside that cave today? We will probably never know.

Conventional wisdom has it that progressives champion urbanity and conservatives disdain it. There’s some truth to that. Progressives are far more likely than conservatives to prefer walkable, high-density communities over auto-dependent, detached-dwelling neighborhoods. Urban areas tend to vote heavily Democratic and rural areas Republican. Even in the more-competitive suburbs, those closest to downtowns tilt blue while outer-ring suburbs and exurbs are red.
 But in day-to-day life, the polarities aren’t so stark. For example, plenty of both conservatives and progressives work in downtown offices, dine or go to shows downtown, and then spend most nights and weekends elsewhere. We may disagree about transportation or zoning policy, but few wish anything other than vitality and success for our major urban centers.
 For these reasons and more, I confess to being dismayed at how much damage progressive politicians are blithely wreaking on their downtowns, in North Carolina and beyond.
 COVID-19 was going to be a challenge for the neo-urbanist movement regardless of how policymakers responded. A viral disease that spreads primarily by lengthy interactions in confined spaces — people sharing buses, trains, offices or small apartments — was always going to hit downtowns particularly hard.
 They aren’t the only places that fit the profile, of course. Immigrants working in rural processing plants and residing in tight quarters would be one example. Nursing and rest homes have proved to be a more tragic one, given the extreme disproportionality of COVID-19 death rates. For non-elderly persons, remember, the disease is no more lethal than other, more-familiar flu-like illnesses, according to the available evidence.
 Still, fear of contagion would have depopulated transit vehicles, central business districts and other familiar features of downtown life for a while, at least, even if governments had not responded with draconian, indiscriminate lockdowns.
 But they did.
 And then, contrary to common sense and their own interests, progressive politicians allowed the protests in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death to devolve, in all too many cases, into rioting. They deployed city police officers poorly, or not at all, to protect downtown businesses. They made excuses for or sometimes even endorsed the actions of violent mobs that attacked public facilities and monuments.
 Put yourself in the shoes of someone owning a downtown business, restaurant, bar or condo. They enjoy urban living. They’ve invested substantial time and resources into it. They’ve watched as state and local governments, understandably concerned in the face of a novel coronavirus, shut down large swaths of that urban life — shopping districts, theaters and concert venues, restaurants, the nightclub scene. Weeks later, they watch as many of the same politicians either look the other way or, more appallingly, seem to cheer as angry activists gathered in already depopulated downtowns to engage in mischief or criminality.
 Would you be enthusiastic about investing more time and resources there? Or would you start looking for someone else to live, work and run a business?
 Alas, the wherewithal to make such decisions is not equally distributed. Many of those with the means to relocate homes and enterprises to the suburbs will do so. Moreover, some jobs are better suited to telecommuting than others. They are also disproportionately held by higher-income individuals who enjoy significant social and political capital.
 The guiding principles of modern American progressivism include egalitarianism and cosmopolitanism. I believe the consequences of COVID-19 and the 2020 riots will advance neither principle.
 For modern American conservatives, whose guiding principles include defense of freedom and respect for tradition, the consequences of COVID-19 and the 2020 riots are also unwelcome. But we aren’t the ones who used a policy sledgehammer on a public-health threat best addressed with surgical tools. And we aren’t the ones who flailed around as the initial burst of righteous indignation at the death of George Floyd turned into looting, vandalism, and a new, more extreme and irrational form of cancel culture.
 Our urban cores will struggle to recover from all this — as will the reputations of the urban politicians who form the core of today’s American Left.

JEFFERSON — For the first time since its county convention on March 7, the Ashe County Republican Party held an in-person meeting on June 16.
 The meeting was held at the Ashe County Republican Party’s Headquarters located at 409 South Main Street in Jefferson.
 Despite the rain, there was a good turnout as members of the Ashe GOP gathered under several tents to stay dry during the meeting.
 Sheriff B. Phil Howell cooked hamburgers and hotdogs for the meeting, where there were also desserts and side items supplied by other members of the GOP.
 Treasurer Terry Sexton presented the ending actual balance of $9,331.79. However, he was unable to provide the current party balance due to being unable to access the account that evening.
 At the meeting, Chairman Jonathan Jordan announced both Vice Chairman Steve Mochen and Secretary Tom Breggar will be resigning from their positions, leaving two vacancies.
 Delores Somers stepped forward to fill the position of Secretary. Somers lives in Helton and she and her family own The Tartan Woolly downtown.
 Nobody else voiced their interest in the position so there was a motion to accept Somers with acclamation.
 Breggar agreed to step up to fill the position of Vice Chairman of the Ashe County Republican Party.
 He said Ashe has a great Republican party compared to where he previously lived in Franklin County which is predominantly Democrat.
 There were no other members interested in the position so a motion of acclamation was made to accept Breggar as the new vice chairman.
 Mochen spoke next, saying he had to resign after accepting a new job that he could not pass up, which he will be starting July 3. He is also trying to sell The Blue Ridge Theater and Event Center.
 He shared some of the work the Trump Victory 2020 team has been doing, which involves 10 counties in North Carolina. Mochen was appointed as a field organizer for the team on June 1.
 He had about 30 volunteers and the region was responsible for making 17,000 calls. The team made around 22,000 calls, completing 1600-1800 calls just over the weekend.
 N.C. Fifth District Representative Virginia Foxx was unable to come to the meeting because she was in Washington D.C. and Sen. Deanna Ballard was in Raleigh. Both plan to attend an Ashe GOP in the near future.
 During the meeting, attendees were able to hear from state candidates as well as local candidates.
 First up was Ray Pickett, who is running against incumbent Rep. Ray Russell to represent District 93 in the North Carolina House of Representatives.
 Pickett shared that the campaign recently started up again and they have been doing some Facebook Live videos. He said the business owners he spoke with during his time in Ashe County echoed the same sentiment, they want businesses to reopen.
 “We’ve got to get our economy rolling again; it has taken a hard hit in the High Country,” Pickett said.
 He handed out business cards for all members to access his contact information and assured them if they would like him to come speak at any group event they are hosting, he will try his best to be there.
 “The right Ray can win this if we get the good people of this Republican party to get to the polls,” Pickett said. “We can take this seat back.”
 Jerry Powers, a candidate for a seat on the Ashe County Board of Commissioners addressed the crowd.
 He said it has been almost 30 years since he was elected the first time and he would appreciate any votes. Powers said the main concern is whether or not an election will be held this year or if it will be a mail-in vote.
 “Some people get the mail in a whole lot more than others do and there’s people I’m sure that will help to see to that,” Powers said.
 He served on the Ashe County Board of Elections for 23 years and he said he doesn’t anticipate mail-in ballots to affect local races as much as state and presidential races.
 County Commissioner William Sands who is running for re-election has served on the BOC for 10 years.
 “During these 10 years, we’ve had a total Republican board and we need to keep that,” Sands said.
 He said Ashe County is healthier financially than the majority of counties in the state and encouraged everyone to continue to vote for Republicans in the local BOC race.
 LaDonna Ryggs who serves as the Grassroots Coordinator for E.C. Sykes spoke on behalf of his campaign. Sykes is running for Secretary of State and is a successful businessman.
 Ryggs previously served as Ted Cruz’s State Director in North Carolina and South Carolina while Sykes volunteered and was the Executive Director for Cruz’s Faith and Religious Liberty portion.
 “I think the thing that really makes E.C. uniquely qualified is the fact that he is a businessman not a politician,” Ryggs said. “He has run tech companies, manufacturing companies, he now owns a family-owned business. He understands small business, he understands large business, but he understands our North Carolina values.”
 More information about Sykes and his campaign can be found at ec4nc.com.
 “I think this worked out really well,” Jordan said at the end of the meeting. At this time he thanked everyone who brought food, Mochen for supplying the tents and tables and Powers for bringing his motor home with a canopy for shelter.

China has been facing worldwide criticism after the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus which has so far claimed 513,913 lives and 10,585,152 people have been infected. It is under the scanner for hiding the outbreak of COVID-19, with some reports suggesting that infection related to the virus may have started as early as in August in China. 123 nations have browbeaten China into accepting a probe into Covid's origin, with the WHO also coming under fire for backing China throughout the most crucial initial months of the outbreak. Amid the worldwide pressure, China has reacted by amping up its customary expansionism on all fronts, with India leading the charge in shutting it down on all fronts, from land-grabs and military aggression, and from data privacy and snooping concerns to debt-trapping firms and countries.

JEFFERSON — A special meeting was held by the Ashe County Board of Education on June 24 to work on the local budget. The meeting, which started at noon, was held in-person at the Central Support Services Annex and was open to the public.
 No members of the public were present and those in attendance were Superintendent Phyllis Yates, Finance Officer Amanda Coldiron, Chairman C.B. Jones Jr. and Vice Chairman Dr. Lee Beckworth, as well as board members Keith McClure, Dianne Eldreth and Polly Jones.
 Dr. Eisa Cox, who will be sworn in as the new Ashe County Schools Superintendent on July 1, was also present via phone call.
 At the beginning of the meeting, Yates said she and Coldiron discussed and rationalized the budget items and came to the consensus of the recommendation to put the local budget on hold.
 Yates said there are many unknowns from both the state and federal level and they still do not know which one of the three plans for the reopening of schools they will have to operate under.
 “We think it would be prudent on our part to wait until after July 1, we need to see what the final state budget is going to be and we need to see what the final federal budget is going to be. And then I think we can better allocate funds from current expenses.”
 After her initial statement, Yates turned the meeting over to Coldiron to discuss items in the capital budget.
 According to Coldiron, out of the $200,000 and the $125,000 approved for fund balance, the school system has $325,000 to work with. School allotments, allotments of funds for school principals and allotments for replacing any equipment is taken out of that $325,000, which left a total of $181,000 up for discussion by the BOE.
 The first item discussed was lighting for the auditorium at Ashe County High School. Since the auditorium is currently remaining unused, the board agreed that it would probably be best to reapply for the high school to reapply for this project next year.
 There was also a request for new furniture and equipment for a computer lab at Mountain View Elementary, which was a project that involved discussion to put it on hold since the lab cannot be accessed at this time. However, there was also a request concerning the safety issue of the basketball goals in the school’s gym which the board decided to discuss further towards the end of the meeting. The goals no longer can be raised up or down without someone on hand to manually adjust them.
 The Ashe County Early College has made a request for an additional teacher, which was an issue on which Cox provided some insight. She said it is a possibility, but before they commit to another teacher she would like to sit down to discuss the needs and scheduling of the ACEC with Principal Elaine Cox prior to making a decision.
 Ashe Early Learning Center is in need of an air conditioning system, as well as tables and chairs for its media center. The BOE has previously discussed the possibility of starting to hold their monthly meetings there since the room in which they currently house their meetings is too small for large gatherings.
 The facility is twice as large as the Central Support Services Annex but its high ceiling proves a challenge to sound projection during meetings. To resolve this issue, Coldiron said she spoke with Maintenance Director Jerry Baker about the possibility of lowering the ceiling.
 Another issue the BOE has experienced while holding meetings in the AELC’s media center, is the fan system which is loud. During the summer months, the room gets hot and the fans would need to be turned off due to the noise they produce.
 Regarding the Informational Technology and Media portion of the capital budget, Coldiron said they completed a separate request for the chrome books, which was denied. However, they believe some of the money received from the CARES Act will cover the first wave of replacements of chrome books.
 According to Coldiron, the chrome books need to be replaced in phases and the school system intentionally designed it that way so all of the laptops purchased would not need to be replaced at the same time. However, Google extended the life one more year, which means two groups of the school’s laptops will need to be replaced at the same time.
 Coldiron said Ashe County Schools received more than $60,000 from the CARES Act from the State and they also put an additional $200,000 in the federal CARES Act money.
 Cox added some additional information to the discussion about the three plans for reopening schools. She said Plan B, which would be a combination of both in-person instruction and remote learning, would be an expensive option.
 She said Plan A would be the most ideal plan in her opinion, which would provide them with additional expenditures such as safety protocols in place. Students will still need devices to use for learning purposes in the event schools will return to a more restrictive plan.
 Cox said she spoke with Yates, Director of Technology Amy Walker, Director of K-12 Curriculum/Federal Programs Julie Taylor and other ACS staff members about the potential of developing some policies and procedures around students being able to take devices home on a regular basis to become familiar with them.
 Funds have been received by the school system to implement wi-fi hotspot locations throughout the county for students and families who do not have internet service at home to utilize.
 Yates said Walker and others have been looking at additional spaces for these hotspots to be set up aside from local fire departments. Walker has also been exploring the option of using school buses, which would be parked at different locations within county limits.
 The next topic of discussion was a metal cover to protect the Literacy Express, which is a $300,000 piece of equipment. Although it is not a safety issue, the BOE decided to pursue the metal cover to protect their investment in the bus.
 Future plans for the Literacy Express and its continuation will be discussed when the BOE meets about the local budget.
 According to Coldiron, Support Services did not have any capital requests.
 The school system has previously discussed the purchase of an activity bus, which they revisited during this budget meeting. The cost of the 26 passenger bus would be $57,979. Coldiron said they have enough money to cover the purchase in their savings.
 The other options were 14 passenger, 18 passenger and 72 passenger buses.
 The BOE decided to move forward with the purchase of the 26 passenger activity bus.
 Next on the list of budget items to be discussed was the request by Director of Maintenance Jerry Baker concerning some paving and water drainage issues at Ashe County High School. The board decided to move forward with these items due to safety concerns.
 There was $96,000 left to allocate at the end of the meeting, which does not include money for the purchase of Chromebooks.
 Prior to adjournment, the BOE talked about how much money they need to consider for masks and sanitation products amid the COVID-19 pandemic for any in-person instruction that may take place this school year.
 Yates said there will be a meeting between Baker, assistant principals and custodians to discuss the bulk purchase of safety and cleaning supplies so every school will be using the same products.
 Regarding masks, they have looked at both cloth and disposable masks. The main concern which was voiced by Yates was the washing of cloth masks daily by parents or students. One suggestion, made by Beckworth and Eldreth was the schools washing masks for students.
 North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is expected to announce the chosen plan for the reopening of the state’s schools by July 1. At this time, each school system will then determine whether or not it will be able to return to instruction under that plan.
 Cox said the school system will need to be prepared for any of the three plans because at any time, the state could require schools to operate under a more restrictive plan.
 Yates said schools can opt for either the plan announced by Cooper or a more restrictive plan. However, they cannot choose a less restrictive plan and if Cooper announces Plan C, it would be the only option under which schools can operate.
 Regarding the results of the survey that was sent out to parents online about their child returning to school or remaining at home for instruction, Yates said it was about a 50/50 split.
 “We feel like there’s enough numbers there that we’re going to have to be able to offer some options for those students,” Yates said.
 Students will need to decide between the two options and stick with it if given the option to physically attend school or complete their instruction at home.
 Teachers will not be responsible for teaching classes virtually and in-person. Yates said staff will need to be repurposed and there will be designated teachers that would teach remotely.
 Prior to adjourning, the BOE voted to approve the metal cover for the Literary Express, the parking lot repairs at the high school, the lowering of the roof of the media center at the AELC and the purchase of the activity bus.
 Coldiron said the approval of these expenses totaled $143,011.

About 120 Holden dealers across the country have accepted a compensation offer from the company as it prepares to exit the Australian market.
 Under the agreement, dealers will be paid $1500 for each car they sold over a set period.
 They are also entitled to reimbursement of some capital development costs and access to ongoing servicing operations.
 Australian Holden Dealer Council Secretary David Nicholson said the dealers were left with no choice but to accept the company's offer after the failure of mediation.
 He said the GM had refused to negotiate in good faith and had rejected taking the issue to arbitration.
 "With great reservation, financial pressure and reluctance, 120 dealers have now accepted GM's compensation offer," Mr Nicholson said in a statement on Wednesday.
 "Today marks a sad day for Australian Holden dealers, and more than 9,000 of their employees, after the majority of dealers were left with no choice."
 Global automotive giant General Motors delivered the final death blow to Holden in February this year, announcing plans to dump the Holden brand by the end of this year.
 The decision came after GM also closed its local manufacturing operations in 2017.
 Holden interim Chairman and Managing Director Kristian Aquilina described the demise of the brand as "agonising" but said the company had chased down "every conceivable option" to keep it afloat.
 "Every strategy, every plan, we looked under every rock," he said.
 The company pledged to offer "fair" redundancy packages to about 600 staff along with compensation to dealers.
 But Mr Nicholson said Holden had failed to show the same support to its dealers that the dealers showed to the brand during tough times.
 "During the 1991 recession and throughout the global financial crisis, Holden dealers continued to take stock from GM in order to help it survive the crisis," he said.
 "Yet, as Australia entered its first since recession since 91, sadly the loyalty and support toward GM has not been reciprocated."
 Holden has been contacted for comment on the compensation agreement.

The pandemic tables have turned, in many ways, with the coronavirus now boiling over in southern and western states like Florida and Texas, while in the Northeast the pot lid is only slightly rattling.
 But Bay Staters just venturing out into the wild are doing so with great trepidation, many still uncomfortable with the idea of eating out or riding the T. Forget about getting on a plane.
 New polling from Suffolk University for WGBH News, the State House News Service, The Boston Globe and MassLive found that more than 66 percent of residents are living with more than normal levels of fear and anxiety. And perhaps that's to be expected.
 Not only are they living through the worst pandemic in over a century, but society is also struggling to come to terms with generations of racism and the inequities that built into every system, from housing to law enforcement.
 Racism, in fact, ranked among the biggest problems residents see facing the state today, which helped to explain the sweeping support found in the Suffolk/WGBH/SHNS poll for broad reforms to policing.
 House Speaker Robert DeLeo also got behind the idea of making Juneteenth (June 19) a state holiday to mark the day that the last slaves were freed in Texas. The amendment filed by Rep. Bud Williams of Springfield was tacked onto a $1.1 billion COVID-19 spending bill.
 Facing up to a past of racism collided this week with the need to confront a more recent history of injustice.
 Despite the fact that 81 percent of residents still think Baker is doing a good job handling the pandemic, there wasn't enough support to sugarcoat a 174-page report that painted a hideous portrait of the leadership at the Holyoke Soldiers' Home.
 Mark Pearlstein, a former federal prosecutor tapped by Baker to conduct an independent investigation into the deaths of at least 76 veterans from COVID-19 at the home, found that a series of "utterly baffling" decisions led to the creation of conditions that allowed the virus to wreak havoc.
 The Pearlstein report focused on the decisions that were made that allowed COVID-19 to flourish inside the walls of the veterans' home, but it also laid out warning signs that Superintendent Bennett Walsh may have been underqualified to run the facility before the start of the pandemic.
 Pearlstein raised questions about what qualifications officials saw in Walsh to back up his hiring as superintendent of a long-term care facility, and laid out in detail his failings as a manager and the administration's lack of vision into the Soldiers' Home that might have prompted them to intervene.
 "Veterans who deserve the best from state government got exactly the opposite, and there's no excuse or plausible explanation for that," Baker said.
 The fallout from the report claimed the job of Veterans' Affairs Secretary Francisco Urena, who was asked to resign in light of Pearlstein's conclusions. He was replaced on an acting basis by Cheryl Poppe, the superintendent of the Chelsea Soldiers' Home. And Baker said he would move to terminate Walsh, who has been on administrative leave.
 Over 2,000 teachers in 47 school districts have also been informed that they will be without a job in the fall, according to the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which is the state's largest teachers' union.
 The layoff and non-renewal notices signal the high level of uncertainty under which local officials are operating as the Legislature has yet to finalize a budget for the upcoming fiscal year, and the Baker administration is currently level-funding local aid to cities and towns in the short-term.
 Schools did get a bit more clarity about what the fall might look like, though.
 The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education put out new guidance this week for schools to contemplate as they think about reopening in the fall, including a continuation of remote learning, staggered in-person learning schedules for students, or a full return with mandatory mask-wearing and desks at least three feet, but preferably six, apart.
 Lunches would be eaten in the classroom, but temperature checks would not be required.
 The guidelines for reopening gave school administrators a lot to think about, and the Baker administration dangled a little more than $200 million in federal relief funding that would help districts buy the supplies they need to safely reopen.
 The governor said it could be at least another month before the state is ready to commit to Chapter 70 aid for the next school year. Baker signed a $5.25 billion interim budget on Friday that will keep government operating through at least July as budget writers in the House, Senate and administration struggle to peer into the future.
 "We don't have a good sort of vision into tax revenue for the next fiscal year yet, and it's going to take a little while to get there," Baker said.
 House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz said the target the House set for his committee in May to release a fiscal 2021 budget proposal by July 1 is no longer feasible, and not likely to be met by next Wednesday.
 Guessing exactly what the Legislature will be able to accomplish by July 31 could be a fun parlor game.
 House Speaker Robert DeLeo has said policing reform is on that list, but he has not yet surfaced a proposal to respond to the legislation filed by Baker to create a police licensing system that would give the state new power to hold cops to standards of law enforcement and professionalism, including bans on the use of forceful tactics like chokeholds.
 The governor got an earful on a visit this week to Mattapan from a woman upset that Baker's bill proposed to pay police up to $5,000 to get the additional training they need to be sensitive to racial biases. He was there to announce the selection of a minority-owned firm to redevelop the last parcel on the former Boston State Hospital campus.
 Rep. Russell Holmes, who has made no secret of his own issues with the DeLeo, came to Baker's defense, crediting him with at least putting a plan on paper.
 Baker also put a plan on paper to implement the recommendations of the Pearlstein report for improved oversight of the state's two Soldiers' Homes. But DeLeo signaled he's in no rush to put that bill on the floor, signaling his own intent to ask House lawmakers next week to support their own investigation through a Special Legislative Oversight Committee.
 Rep. Linda Dean Campbell, a veteran, recommended the oversight committee to DeLeo, and envisions the probe to last into next year, and to focus both on what happened in Holyoke, as well as how the state can broadly improve care for veterans.
 The Senate has not yet signed on to the oversight committee concept, and comity was something in short supply between the branches to start the week.
 The Senate passed health care legislation Thursday to enshrine some of the pandemic protocols that have led to massive growth in the use of telemedicine, and to put an end to surprise billing and expand the scope of practices for some medical professionals.
 The topic of health care, however, was a sensitive one given the accusation made by some House lawmakers -- namely House Majority Leader Ron Mariano and Rep. Dan Cullinane -- that the Senate has been a bad partner in trying to negotiate a path forward with limited time until the end of the session.
 With the House seeking to extend the life of some health care bills, the Senate responded to the criticism by rejecting their extension request, initiating a parliamentary feud that doesn't bode well for much of anything getting accomplished in the health care space over the next month.
 "At some point, because we were being asked to extend and extend, how many times does someone say no before you stop asking them out?" Sen. Cindy Friedman said about the House.
 Given the bad blood, it was a small win that the House and Senate were able to agree to a "compromise" over local road repair funding and the future of the MBTA's oversight board.
 Rather than remake the temporary Fiscal and Management Control Board into something more permanent, Democratic leaders agreed to simply extend its authorization for another year. And on the issue of Chapter 90 funding, it's also the status quo moving forward.
 Both branches earlier this year had passed legislation to bump Chapter 90 funding to $300 million for the year, delighting cities and towns after years of lobbying for more money.
 But with the pandemic crushing state finances and the Senate apparently unwilling to take up the House's transportation tax bill, the compromise was to punt.

When Mrs Ajimobi watches that video again in the future, she may regret speaking too hastily. She only needs to do a review of the reactions to her outburst by the public. She has been accused of having “a sense of entitlement”. “Who does she think she is?”, some asked. The Agodi GRA property where she wanted her husband buried has also become a subject of many uncomplimentary remarks about her husband’s integrity. She has even been told that if she loved her husband that much, why didn’t she shut down her own shop the day her husband was buried? Ordinary Nigerians are not always nice to political leaders dead or alive. Social media has given them such voice and freedom that has turned them into a “Constituted Authority” of their own. But the Oyo State Government should sheathe its sword and not add to Mrs Ajimobi’s grief. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in a book titled “On Death and Dying” wrote about the “Five Stages of Grief,” and although the emotions of grief are not scientifically chronological, anger is one of them. When people lose loved ones, they tend to be angry for various reasons, until they come to terms with reality. Mrs Ajimobi deserves support, not abuse at this time.

The first winter was devoted to fixing up the old house and buying equipment. Come spring, they knew they would have to do a lot of fencing. All the fences were poor and needed help.
 Like on every farm, things didn’t work out just as planned for timing. David was able to pick up six good milk cows at an auction before he got those fences in. Those six cows were allowed to roam at will around the place while David and the oldest boy built the fence. The two smaller children were left with the job of keeping the cows relatively close to the house so they wouldn’t get lost.
 Danny, their non-descript pup, enjoyed hassling those cows a lot more than they appreciated him. Whenever they thought they had a chance to nail Danny, they would give it a try. That pup was just too quick for those clumsy old milk cows and never did get hooked on a horn. One day, however, it was a close one. An old cow almost got that pesky pup. Danny scurried up a bank and down a hole. The children investigated and found the hole to be an entrance to a larger cavity. David dug into it and found a full-fledged room, all laid up with blocks of limestone. Inside were some old crates, barrels, and fruit jars. As soon as the fencing was done and a garden was planted, David and Jennie worked on that root cellar, fixing it up. They spent quite a bit of money on it, putting in a nice brick floor, chinking the walls, and building shelves for fruit and canned goods. They thought they really had a nice thing there. The cellar had two huge wine barrels in it. These had apparently been left as they were too big to go through the narrow door.
 As the garden produce was gathered that fall, they stored a lot of it in the cave plus put three hundred jars of canned goods in there.
 Just inside the door, The Traceys kept a supply of matches and candles so they could have some light. Those fruit cellars can be awfully dark even on a sunny day.
 Late one afternoon the five year old girl, Amy, came strolling into the house eating an apple. Jennie knew that her daughter was too little to be using a candle and playing with matches. Little Amy was promptly scolded by her mother for going into the cave and using those matches.
 Little Amy protested that she didn’t use any candles. She said she could see real well by the light coming out of the wine barrel. This perplexed Jennie. She couldn’t fathom what Amy was talking about. She dismissed it as a tall tale Amy came up with to get out from under the matches issue. Jennie didn’t even mention the incident to her husband. Life can be real busy on an eighty- acre farm, and she quite forgot it. One evening, however, one of the smaller boys looked up from his supper and asked his father how he got the light in the barrel out in the cave.
 “What do you mean, light in the barrel?” His father asked.

PENN YAN -- Congressman Paul Tonko (D-NY20) is endorsing his fellow Democratic colleague Tracy Mitrano in her bid to unseat the Republican incumbent in New York's 23rd congressional district. Tonko's district includes all of Albany and Schenectady counties and parts of Montgomery, Rensselaer and Saratoga counties. He is serving his sixth term in Congress.
   
 "Tracy has the energy, commitment and passion for public service that is required for the job. She doesn't hesitate to roll up her sleeves to find common sense solutions to the challenges in her district. I endorsed Tracy in 2018 and I am proudly endorsing her again," Tonko said. "Her voice as a cybersecurity expert is sorely needed in Congress, and I couldn't be more proud to support her campaign."
   
 "I'm honored by Congressman Tonko's confidence in me," said Mitrano. "Working together as fellow upstaters, we could do a great deal of good for our region in Congress, from extending broadband Internet services to rural areas to preserving the natural beauty of our districts."
   
 Tonko chairs the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change and serves on the Science, Space and Technology Committee, as well as on the Natural Resources Committee. He is also the co-chair of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, or SEEC. Since Democrats took the majority in the House of Representatives in 2018, he has worked as a primary architect of Congressional climate change legislation to protect clean air, water and soil, and to create new clean energy jobs.
   
 Tonko is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the oldest standing committee in the House. He's the first upstate New York Democrat to serve on that committee since 1966.
   
 Mitrano faces Rep. Tom Reed, R-Corning, in November's general election, a rematch of the 2018 election.

JEFFERSON — The Ashe County Board of Education met virtually through Zoom Video Communications on June 29. This meeting was bittersweet as it was Superintendent Phyllis Yates’ last meeting with the BOE. Yates retired effective July 1.
 Those present on the Zoom call included Yates, Chairman C.B. Jones Jr., Vice Chairman Dr. Lee Beckworth, Dr. Eisa Cox, and board members Dianne Eldreth, Keith McClure and Polly Jones.
 Ashe County Middle School representatives Principal Dustin Farmer and Todd Rivver ,who teaches ELA and seventh grade Social Studies, joined the meeting to talk about the Vocabulary Bowl.
 ACMS received its banner and trophy for winning first place in the competition, which were seen behind Farmer and Rivver during the Zoom call.
 Rivver voiced his desire at the beginning of the school year for ACMS to get involved with the Vocabulary Bowl, which is a national competition.
 Farmer said it was one of the best things he has been a part of in his 17 years in education. The students had left school on a Friday and didn’t return to school due to COVID-19 causing school closures across the country.
 “We had around 200 of our 500 kids participate that evening, they got to spend the evening together,” Farmer said. “I decided I would stay on the roof that night, so I participated in the Zoom session from the roof in a tent it was about 40 degrees.”
 ACMS students came from behind 5,000 words mastered and won by about 500 words. The school they beat, Harris Road Middle School, went to bed thinking they were state champions and ended up placing second.
 “The kids did phenomenal, it was just a wonderful experience. Thank you to the school board and Mrs. Yates and especially Mr. Farmer,” Rivver said.
 Ashe County High School Athletic Director David Koontz presented information about the school’s recent honor.
 The National Federation of State High School Associations recently announced that ACHS earned Level 1 status in the NFHS School Honor Roll. This recognizes schools for their professional development of coaching staff.
 “I’m extremely proud of our coaching staff for this national honor,” Koontz said.
 To date, ACHS is one of 43 schools across the United States receiving this honor. The school will be receiving a banner to hang for display in its gymnasium.
 “I would put our coaching staff up against anybody in the state, they’re tremendous,” Koontz said. “They always rise to the occasion and they always put kids first and they know the importance that education plays in the role of athletics in high school and how critical it is to our success.”
 Student Services Coordinator Jamie Little and Director of K-12 Curriculum/Federal Programs Julie Taylor provided information about the summer remediation program and jump start plans.
 These programs are for students K-4 who were identified at mid-year or at the time of school closure as behind in math or reading.
 Little said there has been a lot of interest in the program and dates have been set for July 20-31.
 The plan was submitted June 22 and has been approved.
 Little provided an update on the school system’s pursuit of the partnership with Western Youth Network to provide after school care. The goal is to begin the program with WYN when students return to in-person instruction.
 She spoke with WYN Executive Director Jennifer Warren about the possibility of providing bus transportation and she was very much in favor of providing transportation.
 The MoU involves the County of Ashe, the Cooperative Extension, Ashe County Schools and Western Youth Network.
 Yates shared an update from her recent meeting with ACHS Principal Amanda Hipp about the upcoming graduation ceremony. The event is still scheduled for Saturday, July 25 and a time has not been set yet.
 In the event that inclement weather were to occur, the event would be moved inside with a reduction in people allowed to attend due to social distancing.
 Toward the end of the meeting, the focus shifted to the upcoming change coming to ACS on July 1. Yates will be retiring from the school system and Dr. Eisa Cox will be sworn in that morning as the new superintendent of schools.
 “It is the 29th of June and in a couple of days you all are going to have a new leader,” Yates said. “I just want to welcome Dr. Eisa Cox, I want to welcome you to Ashe County.”
 Yates spoke highly about the students, parents and the Central Support Services staff during this time. She offered her assistance to Cox to help with anything she may need during this transition.
 “I have big shoes to fill,” Cox said. “And I appreciate you extending your time to me over the last couple of weeks and including me. And I have seen firsthand how hard Central Services works, I am truly looking forward to being there and working on a daily basis, face-to-face with the team. I truly appreciate your leadership and what you’ve done to make this a smooth transition for me.”
 A tearful Yates expressed how blessed she was to have a job that she loved coming to each day.
 “It’s really hard for me to express to all of my coworkers how much I love them and how much I appreciate them and the 12 days of Phyllis have been absolutely wonderful,” Yates said.
 Board members then expressed their gratitude and partook in welcoming Cox and saying goodbye to Yates.
 “I never have known anyone who has worked as hard as you have for the staff and the students of this county,” Polly Jones said.
 Jones expressed her love for Yates and wished her a happy retirement and the best of everything life has to offer.
 “Phyllis, I’d like to wish you the best in your upcoming days,” Eldreth said. “I really appreciate what you’ve done for Ashe County Schools over the last many, many years. I know you helped me as a teacher and helped me fill out all those good retirement papers that I appreciated, because you made it very simple. And you’ve done that for a lot of folks, you’ve done many, many things for a lot of folks.”
 “You are extremely hardworking and I’ve always known that I could come to you for advice,” McClure said.
 He added that he wants Yates to know that she will be missed and that she is appreciated.
 Beckworth spoke about the many years he worked with Yates and the many conversations they had.
 “She has dedicated her life to this school system and it shows,” Beckworth said. “She’s done a great job for us, we’re going to miss her in the school system but we won’t miss her as a friend. And I look forward to keeping that friendship going.”
 Jones extended a welcome to Cox saying he will do anything he can to help her. He then expressed his gratitude to Yates, who he has worked many years with, which he described as both an honor and a privilege.
 “We certainly will always be your friend and have nothing but good things to say about you. And we wish you the best of luck in retirement,” he said.
 In closing, Yates took a moment to thank her family for their support over the years.
 “They’ve really stood by me all these years, when I should’ve been doing things with them, but they went ahead and they left me at work and they went ahead and they enjoyed the things that they were doing together,” Yates said. “So I don’t want to miss anymore of that.”
 The meeting can be accessed in its entirety on the school system’s Facebook page _@Ashe County_ Public Schools.

Just minutes later, it was Cristiano Ronaldo's time to shine for the Old Lady. The former Real Madrid man got the ball near the halfway line before going on a darting run past several Genoa players. The attacker covered some ground with his run before unleashing a powerful shot from outside the 18-yard box leaving Perin with no chance of getting close to it. The Cristiano Ronaldo's goal was his 24th league goal of the season in just 25 appearances. After a slow start to the current campaign, the Portuguese hit the ground running in 2020. He is still five goals short of Ciro Immobile, who has 29 league goals this season.

I've told everyone who has received sunscreen to use it sparingly so that the units can last a little longer," he said.

“To say the least, we are excited to keep this event to the caliber you have grown accustomed to from past years. A community event such as this is needed more than ever this year,” adds Gobble.
 The fireworks will once again be shot off on July 4th at dark from Riverview Park, allowing the community to enjoy a wonderful display right on the mighty Mississippi. As in years past, Ave H (Business Hwy 61) will be shut down to traffic to allow residents and guests the opportunity to have a better view — as well as provide social distancing. There will not be admittance into Riverview for viewing for safety reason.
 Gobble says Partners is thankful for those community members that continued to financially support this. The fireworks display depends on this type of support, and without it the display wouldn’t have happen.
 A very special thank you to our major sponsors, including: Scotts Miracle Gro, Connection Bank & Insurance, Mohrfeld Solar, Pilot Grove Savings Bank, Family Dentistry, Shottenkirk, Inc., OCI/Iowa Fertilizer, Fort Madison Community Hospital & Jim Baier, Inc. Their continued community support have made this year’s display possible.
 “A full listing Thank You will follow the display and I hope that everyone in the community will thank them when patronizing their establishments,” Gobble said.

Deputy Shane Owens received a statement from the Muskogee Police Department regarding the unauthorized use of Carla Tucker’s debit card. According to the MPD, Tucker said she noticed a charge on her debit card for $204 at Diamondhead Bar and Grill in Tahlequah. The woman said she had never been to that location and did not know who made the charges.
 Deputy Aaron Johnson received a walk-in report June 25, from Thomas Stopp, who said someone had taken his calcium medication from his mailbox. He said it was not the first time this has happened.
 Stephanie Hunt said her mailbox in Fort Gibson had been broken into June 26. She told Deputy Johnson a package had been opened and there was nothing inside. The contents were steel billets for knife-making.
 Deputies Kaitlin Rafalko and Pete Broderick were dispatched to apartments on 512 Road in regard to a disturbance. When they arrived, they were met by Drushaun Teehee, who appeared to be under the influence of intoxicants. She was with her boyfriend, Chris Kennedy, who also indicated he had been drinking earlier in the day. While attempting to speak with Kennedy, the deputies reported Teehee began screaming from the other room, at which time Rafalko closed the door, so she could continue hearing Kennedy’s side of the story. Teehee told the deputy it did not matter what his side was, because it was her home and she wanted him to leave. Kennedy told the deputies Teehee had active warrants, and Teehee refused to give the deputies information. Kennedy agreed to leave. While outside, Kennedy told deputies he wanted to press charges, because she had scratched, hit and stabbed him with a key on his chest the day before, and Rafalko took pictures. As the deputies returned to try and detain Teehee for the assault, she reused to open the door. Eventually, she reopened the door and and the deputies immediately placed her in a patrol unit. While receiving more information from Kennedy, Rafalko wrote in the report that Teehee began banging on the widows and door of the unit. Teehee asked the deputies to speak with her father, a retired Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper. According to the report, “due to professional courtesy with Trooper Teehee, we did not take his daughter to jail on the charges and let her go with him.” Kennedy was transported to the Tahlequah Men’s Shelter.
