 To follow the University of Rhode Island men's basketball team over the past week was to experience the very essence of fandom.
 The mood in Kingston ran the emotional gamut -- anger, despair, joy and satisfaction. Such is life for the Rams and several other programs in the age of unprecedented player movement.
 In terms of public perception, David Cox needed a 24-hour period like Monday to put URI back on the right track. There are several Ryan Center regulars who would sign up for a 21-9 season and a place in the top four of the Atlantic 10 every year. But frequent roster departures and a stumble down the stretch to finish the 2019-20 campaign left an odd taste.
 Then came a dose of bitterness when Tyrese Martin announced his intention to transfer. In terms of on-court ability and four-year potential, he's the best player by quite some distance to leave the Rams since Cox was hired prior to the start of the 2018-19 season. To put this in some perspective -- as a media member, you're far more likely to receive a text message from a program source when a prospect commits than an explanatory phone call from the head coach when one of his best players departs.
 That feeling lingered into Friday when three-star Brooklyn native Abou Ousmane committed to URI. One of five remaining scholarships was filled by a frontcourt player with some reported upside, and the Rams entered the weekend on a positive note. It was just a preview of what was to come.
 If the next few years play out the way URI fans hope, one particular day will represent a pivot point. Maryland transfers Makhi Mitchell and Makhel Mitchell announced their commitments to the Rams via Instagram in the morning. Charlotte transfer Malik Martin announced his commitment to URI via Twitter in the afternoon. A three-man recruiting class, including Ousmane and guards Ishmael Leggett and Elijah Wood, had suddenly doubled.
 It's no small thing for the Rams to reel in four-star talent like the Mitchells. Their last two NCAA Tournament teams were filled with it -- Jared Terrell, E.C. Matthews, Stanford Robinson and Kuran Iverson all earned such rankings out of high school. URI has also showed the ability to develop three- star players like Hassan Martin, Jarvis Garrett, Jeff Dowtin, Cyril Langevine and Fatts Russell into cornerstones.
 What does all this mean for 2020-21? That largely depends on a potential rule change that is suddenly popular in Rams circles. The NCAA is doing away with its controversial waiver process and could allow players to transfer once in their respective careers without sitting out the mandatory two semesters in residence. The Mitchells and Martin would all be sidelined for the entirety of next season under the current setup.
 On paper, URI would be unlikely to contend at or near the top of the Atlantic 10 without those three players. Russell certainly figures to be one of the best returners in the league (should he remove his name from NBA Draft consideration), but the supporting cast behind him would include one fellow starter (Jermaine Harris), two reserves from last season (Antwan Walker, Jacob Toppin), two players who sat out last season (Jeremy Sheppard, DJ Johnson) and three freshmen. That's generally not a winning recipe against college basketball's elite.
 Assuming all Rams are eligible, this roster has the potential to play deep into March Madness. Martin provides veteran depth behind Russell and Sheppard, and a final addition -- someone like DePaul graduate transfer Devin Gage, for example -- could further solidify a talented backcourt. URI would be replacing Cyril Langevine through a collective approach in the frontcourt, with Walker, Toppin and the Mitchells all having flashed a sign or two of ability.
 The next challenge comes due to the coronavirus pandemic. Players and staff members remain off campus, presenting both academic and athletic obstacles. Summer sessions -- the extra coursework in the classroom, the additional on- court and off-court workouts -- have become vital to building chemistry and preparing for the five-month grind of the regular season.
 That period would prove especially valuable for the Rams with as many as seven new players on the roster. URI still has an open scholarship to offer aside from welcoming the Mitchells, Martin, Ousmane, Leggett and Wood. The three transfers are experienced enough to understand the daily demands of college basketball, but the smaller details of adapting to life with the Rams could prove important.
 These are the types of conversations URI should welcome. They speak to the promise of what's to come instead of the difficulties that soon could be just distant memories. Sometimes all it takes is a week or so like this one to significantly change perspective.

CHARLESTON — One of the worst-case scenarios for the travel sports industry became a reality late Tuesday.
 United States Youth Soccer announced the decision to cancel its Presidents Cup, National Championships and all regional tournaments via notice to state association presidents, board members, committee/advisory chairs and its national staff.
 The organization’s Eastern Presidents Cup was scheduled for June 19-23 and the Eastern Regional Tournament was scheduled for June 26 to July 2 at the Barboursville Soccer Complex and the Shawnee Sports Complex in Institute, West Virginia.
 The two sites split the tournaments in 2019 as well.
 With 15 organizations representing 13 states all descending on the area, the cancellations bring an overall economic loss of somewhere between $28 million and $30 million for the region, according to West Virginia Soccer Association President Len Rogers.
 Barboursville had hosted USYS events prior to last year — the 2009, 2010, 2015 and 2016 Eastern Regionals were held there — but the development of Shawnee and the partnership between the two sites helped maximize the experience for all involved.
 “Shawnee made perfect sense logistically. We want everybody’s experience to be good,” Barboursville Mayor Chris Tatum said. “Getting them on board, we had hotels from Clendenin to Grayson, Kentucky, full. We had people in hotels staying as far as Chapmanville.”
 Kanawha County Commissioner and gubernatorial hopeful Ben Salango was integral in getting the Shawnee Sports Complex built and in having a part in hosting USYS events. Salango said 41 hotels in the immediate area were filled for the Eastern Regional a year ago, and even though the financial impact will be felt, steps are already being taken to help minimize the losses.
 The cancellations of qualifying tournaments in April and May were major contributing factors in the decision to cancel the Eastern Regional so early. But on the flip side, clubs across the country suddenly have a wide-open schedule in late June and early July and that provides an opportunity should the coronavirus pandemic be under control by then.
 “Obviously, we’re disappointed, but we’re already looking at alternatives,” Salango said. “We’re working on scheduling tournaments in late June and July so local teams and teams all over the Eastern United States may be able to come and participate.

 One omission in the meeting agenda is any aspect of the six-month housing moratorium, which up until two weeks ago was a centerpiece for city operations.
 At the last meeting, Councilors debated the merits of several options to open streams of revenue dedicated to funding attainable housing, including a levy lid lift and a look at grants and loans.

SALEM, Ore. (AP) — A doctor at a veterans home in Oregon used a malaria drug to treat eight patients there for coronavirus, but said a state rule enacted last month would prevent him from treating any more veterans there. After pushback against the Oregon Board of Pharmacy's March 25 rule, the board amended it on Wednesday to allow the drug to be used not only in hospitals for confirmed COVID-19 cases, but also long-term care facilities like the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon, Oregon.il. Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, showed encouraging signs in small, early tests against the coronavirus but has not proved safe or effective for this in any major scientific studies yet. It’s approved now for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In the second week of March, the first cases of the coronavirus began emerging at the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon, Oregon, when two men in their 80s fell ill with COVID-19. Then more got sick. After hearing that hydroxychloroquine could be effective, Dr. Rob Richardson began treating eight of the veterans with it and an antibiotic called azithromycin, also known as Z-Pak. “I was using it to give them a fighting chance,” Richardson told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. On March 25, the Oregon Board of Pharmacy adopted a temporary emergency rule prohibiting the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine “for presumptive treatment or prevention of COVID-19 infection.” The board said it was taking the action to preserve supplies for treatment of malaria, inflammatory conditions, and documented COVID-19 infection in hospitalized patients. It was the “hospitalized” part that would have prevent Richardson from treating more patients with the same drugs that the federal...
