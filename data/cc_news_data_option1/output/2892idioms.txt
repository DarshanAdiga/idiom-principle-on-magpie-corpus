 One of the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in its most recent and momentous term concerned the religious order the Little Sisters of the Poor and the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act.
 The Catholic Diocese of Erie does not come up in the Supreme Court's 7-2 ruling, issued July 8, that upheld the Trump administration's regulations that exempt from the mandate religious organizations such as the Little Sisters.
 The Catholic Diocese of Erie still had a role in the case. And no matter what you think about the Supreme Court's decision, a recap reveals how the Erie diocese influenced a contentious legal and social issue.
 In May 2012, with Bishop Donald W. Trautman nearing the end of his 20-year tenure, the Catholic Diocese of Erie joined a number of religious organizations nationwide, including the Little Sisters of the Poor, in suing the administration of President Barack Obama over the constitutionality of the contraception mandate, arguing that it violated the groups' rights because they oppose birth control.
 The challenges were consolidated, and the case went to the Supreme Court. The lead petitioner was Pittsburgh Catholic Bishop David Zubik.
 The Catholic Diocese of Erie remained a petitioner. And when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case, on March 23, 2016, current Erie Catholic Bishop Lawrence Persico and I were in the audience when Erie Catholic Charities was mentioned during the justices' questions.
 The Zubik case was decided in a strange fashion on May 16, 2106. Lacking a ninth member due to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, an apparently deadlocked Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower courts. The justices asked the government and the religious organizations, including the Catholic Diocese of Erie, to work out a compromise.
 A compromise never happened.
 After Donald Trump took office as president, he ended the Zubik case in October 2017. His administration said any organization or business, religious or otherwise, can refuse insurance coverage for contraception if they object to it on religious or moral grounds.
 The Zubik case was over. The dispute was not. The states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey sued over the Trump regulations, leading to the appeal that sent the new case of the Little Sisters of the Poor to the Supreme Court.
 The nuns' biggest ally turned out to be Donald Trump. On a smaller scale, the Catholic Diocese of Erie played a part, too.

Jim grew up in the "Greektown" area of McGill, Nevada and graduated from White Pines High School in 1963. After high school Jim moved to Reno, Nevada to attend the University of Nevada, Reno. He returned to McGill every summer to work at Kennecott Copper Corporation, making enough money to pay for books and tuition for the next year of college. After graduating from the University of Nevada in 1967, he joined Pioneer Citizens Bank and worked his way up the ranks to become the bank's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In 1990, Jim accepted an offer to become the Chief Financial Officer of MidState Bank and Trust in Arroyo Grande, California. While there, he was instrumental in the acquisition of a number of community banks, driving the growth of MidState Bank &amp; Trust into a tri-county banking powerhouse with 41 branches serving California's central coast. He retired in 2007 after the Dutch bank, Rabobank, acquired MidState Bank &amp; Trust. Jim was in a loving relationship with his partner of 23 years, Sidney Clark. They loved to spend time with friends and family and to travel the world in search of new adventures. Jim was preceded in death by his parents and his four siblings, Tessie Lujano, Dean Stathos, Sheila Stathos and Peggy Prisbrey. Jim was the favorite uncle of many nieces and nephews, all of whom he loved dearly. Rather than a formal service, Jim wanted his friends to gather and remember the good times and to toast him with a gin martini, very dry with an olive. At a later date, a celebration of his life will be held for his family, friends and co-workers in Reno, Nevada as well as in San Luis Obispo, California.

CHICAGO -- Jose Quintana expressed a mixture of frustration and fortune regarding the cut nerve in his left thumb that has altered the back end of the Chicago Cubs rotation.
   
 Quintana said he suffered the injury while washing a wine glass in his Miami home the night before he was scheduled to depart for Chicago for summer training camp.
   
 Earlier that day, Quintana said he threw the equivalent of four innings and 50 to 55 pitches.
   
 "Rough stuff," he said. "A lot of frustration. It was an accident."
   
 Quintana said the stem of the wine glass shattered and inflicted the wound.
   
 The next two weeks could dictate how soon he might be able to rejoin a rotation that currently has Tyler Chatwood as the third starter and Jon Lester and Alec Mills tentatively holding the last two spots. The Cubs are monitoring Lester's workload closely because of the mileage on his 36-year-old arm.
   
 Quintana, who is throwing on flat ground from 90 to 105 feet, hopes to throw off a mound in the next seven to 10 days and believes he'll be able to throw a curveball soon without any discomfort in his thumb.
   
 "I don't know when I'll be available to pitch, but so far I feel great," said Quintana, who underwent surgery July 2 and started his throwing program Thursday. "And it seems right now it's more important for my shoulder and body to be healthy.
   
 "My thumb feels great. No pain is good. But I know it's too soon to say how it's going to feel (throwing) a bullpen (session). Honestly, I don't want to say too much. I want to show how I feel on the mound and show everything I have."
   
 General manager Jed Hoyer last week equated Quintana's eventual return to adding a player via a midseason trade.
   
 Quintana knows he has a long way to regain the shoulder strength. He wasn't allowed to perform cardio work to avoid infection in the thumb but was lifting weights.
   
 The injury doesn't help his stock as a free agent after this season. He is in the final year of a contract that will pay him a prorated portion of $11.5 million.
   
 "(Free agency) is on my mind, but I try not to pay attention to that," Quintana said. "I don't have any time, honestly, to focus on free agency. Just focus on being ready.
   
 "It's tough when you see too many days ahead when you're going to be on the mound, but I can wait."

The Reserve Bank of India’s efforts to keep a lid on borrowing costs in Asia’s third-largest economy created more than ₹8 trillion ($108 billion) of excess cash in the banking system. Sponging away the extra money isn’t going to be easy.
 A largely benign outlook for inflation amid a slump in demand, slowdown in credit growth, a sharply positive balance of payments and lessons from the RBI’s own cash-tightening three years ago suggest that this amount of cash — which exceeds the level seen after a surprise cash ban in late 2016 — will be the new normal for the next few months.
 “I don’t think this liquidity is moving away in a hurry,” said Ritesh Bhusari, deputy general manager for treasury at South Indian Bank. “Unlike demonetisation, which was the fallout of an economic policy decision, excess liquidity this time is a creation of the central bank. It may stay for the next six months.”
 The liquidity measures taken by the RBI since February aggregate to ₹9.57 trillion or about 4.7 per cent of gross domestic product. That pushed up the excess cash banks park with the authority to more than ₹8 trillion in May.
 ## Liquidity glut
 The central bank’s management of the liquidity glut came into focus this month when Governor Shaktikanta Das for the first time spoke about the need for a careful strategy to exit from the extraordinary monetary stimulus. To be sure, he made it clear that it was not imminent.
 The situation has drawn parallels to late 2016 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s shock high-value cash ban led to a surge in deposits with banks. As liquidity rose in 2017, the RBI began open-market sale of bonds, mopping up about ₹900 billion.
 This time around, the authority needs the excess liquidity to induce banks to absorb the government’s blowout bond supply.
 Bloomberg Economics expects a record $95 billion surplus on the balance of payments in fiscal 2021. That would largely be met by forex purchases to prevent rupee from gaining further.
 Net FX purchases of $80 billion in fiscal 2021 would lead to a ₹6-trillion liquidity injection into the system, which has already been running a record surplus since the start of the fiscal year, according to Abhishek Gupta, India economist at Bloomberg.

More than 1,200 Centers for Disease Control employees recently signed a letter imploring Director Robert Redfield to declare racism a public health crisis and for the CDC to "clean its own house" by instituting what they're calling seven acts of change. Among the demands is an acknowledgment that the CDC has a "toxic culture of exclusion and racial discrimination" and an increase to Black representation among top leadership. The letter notes that out of 30 senior officials at the CDC, only three are Black, and two out of the three are in leadership roles related to race.
   
 "At CDC, we have a powerful platform from which to create real change," they wrote. "By declaring racism a public health crisis, the agency has an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the power of science to confront this insidious threat that undermines the health and strength of our entire nation."
   
 The employees make a powerful point: Racism is a pandemic that's been raging for centuries, and it's deadly. In the Black community, it takes lives through police brutality, inadequate health care and unequal economic opportunities. We saw it this spring, when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on the neck of George Floyd, an African American man, for nearly nine minutes, until he was dead. And we see it daily in our own communities, as COVID-19 disproportionately affects people of color -- something the primarily white CDC leadership clearly didn't want to admit, seeing as The New York Times had to sue them to gather data related to the pandemic's racial breakdown. It shows that Black and Latinx Americans are three times as likely to contract coronavirus as whites, and twice as likely to die from it.
   
 Unsurprisingly, when the White House Coronavirus Task Force was initially announced, there was not a single Black or Latinx expert on the list, and though several people of color have since joined, the group is still overwhelmingly white (and male).
   
 A lack of appropriate racial representation is not just an issue in the health sphere, however. It's evident in nearly every industry, and people are demanding change. Wall Street Journal reporters last month called on their leaders to bring more diversity to newsroom positions and "encourage more muscular reporting about race and social inequities." Goldman Sachs has pledged to no longer take companies public with all-white male boards. And Vanity Fair just this year finally ran a front cover photographed by a Black photographer, Dario Calmese.
   
 All that is to say the work has only just begun. In response to Floyd's killing, equity demands and calls for racial justice overwhelm our social media feeds and city streets today, but the question is whether that will translate to action tomorrow -- and every day thereafter. Black people should not have to die for companies to hire diverse voices; diversity should be valued on its own.
   
 If in 2020, it is still unclear to those with hiring power why diversity matters, a study done by professors in Amsterdam in 2016 makes it clear. An openness toward diversity within a company encourages more communication and inclusion between people, they found, as well as "increased knowledge sharing." So, not only do hiring practices matter for properly serving your community, they create a more collaborative workplace.
   
 Embracing diversity goes beyond just hiring people to placate the public or to look politically correct. Institutions all over this country have an ethical responsibility to hold a mirror up to their employee racial makeup and hold themselves accountable when they find it lacking a true representation of the population. It's not about cherry-picking people of color to only address race issues, and it's certainly not about virtue signaling to prove something to employees and the public. That's not diversity, that's tokenism.
   
 As we've seen with COVID-19, failing to take precautions to contain a disease allows it to flourish. It's beyond time we each did our part to end the racism pandemic.

His third short, _Secrets_ , is also a gripping drama depicting how secrets get unravelled the more you try to brush them under the carpet. The film is nine minutes long and has been shot in the midst of snowcapped mountains in Auli in Uttarakhand. But sadly, Souradeep feels that there's no impetus for short filmmakers like him in Kolkata, where producers want to play it safe with time-tested formulaic movies that appeal to the box office.

James G Stathos James G Stathos was born in Ely, Nevada to James K. and Mildred Nichols Stathos. He died peacefully at his home in Carmel, California on July 15, 2020 at the age of 74. Jim grew up in the "Greektown" area of McGill, Nevada and graduated from White Pines High School in 1963. After high school Jim moved to Reno, Nevada to attend the University of Nevada, Reno. He returned to McGill every summer to work at Kennecott Copper Corporation, making enough money to pay for books and tuition for the next year of college. After graduating from the University of Nevada in 1967, he joined Pioneer Citizens Bank and worked his way up the ranks to become the bank's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In 1990, Jim accepted an offer to become the Chief Financial Officer of MidState Bank and Trust in Arroyo Grande, California. While there, he was instrumental in the acquisition of a number of community banks, driving the growth of MidState Bank & Trust into a tri-county banking powerhouse with 41 branches serving California's central coast. He retired in 2007 after the Dutch bank, Rabobank, acquired MidState Bank & Trust. Jim was in a loving relationship with his partner of 23 years, Sidney Clark. They loved to spend time with friends and family and to travel the world in search of new adventures. Jim was preceded in death by his parents and his four siblings, Tessie Lujano, Dean Stathos, Sheila Stathos and Peggy Prisbrey. Jim was the favorite uncle of many nieces and nephews, all of whom he loved dearly. Rather than a formal service, Jim wanted his friends to gather and remember the good times and to toast him with a gin martini, very dry with an olive. At a later date, a celebration of his life will be held for his family, friends and co-workers in Reno, Nevada as well as in San Luis Obispo, California.

PLYMOUTH - Good friends and great times are what Emma Cicchetti will take out of four years with the field hockey and softball programs at Plymouth South.
 "I can't tell you how many of the friendships I have right now were made because of high school sports," said Cicchetti, who will head off to the College of St. Rose in Albany, NY where she will major in Buisness Communications and work on a minor in Public Relations. "People I may not have had to chance to get to know at all I became close friends with because of the bonds we formed as teammates."
 Cicchetti came at the sports of field hockey and softball from totally different perspectives. She played softball all along while growing up, developing into a solid player along the way. Field hockey, however, was a different situation altogether.
 "I can honestly say that field hockey was a last minute decision for me," Cicchetti explained. "I'd never played the game before in my life when I signed up to play as a freshman."
 The decision to go out for the team was a great decision for this particular Panther.
 "I never expected to have as much fun playing field hockey as I actually did over the last four years," said Cicchetti, who may play it as a club sport in college. "It was a totally new experience playing up on the forward line. I struggled learning the game as a freshman but eventually I got the hang of it. I had so much fun on and off the field with that group of girls."
 Cicchetti's was part of two Patriot League Fisher Division champion softball teams that made extended runs in the South sectional tournament. She'd played the sport since she was a youngster and spent a lot of time on youth and travel teams with players she'd eventually compete against at Plymouth North.
 She was a swing player as a freshman, pitching on the JV squad and coming up to the varsity team when she was needed. As a sophomore she mostly pitched JV and finally came up as a full-time varsity player as a junior, starting in left field and also pitching a little bit when needed.
 With star pitcher Amelia Freitas out for the spring season while recovering from foot surgery, Cicchetti was expected to be the starting pitcher this season for the Panthers as they went for a third straight league title. That was before things were called off because of the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic.
 "I guess I'm a little sad that I didn't get the chance to be the starting pitcher this season, but that's the way things turned out," she said.
 A National Honor Society student her junior and senior years, Cicchetti was also a shining light in South's Marketing and DECA programs. She was regional winner in DECA for her project on the school store, qualifying to go to Nashville, TN to compete at DECA's International Career Development Conference.

After a three-month shutdown the Harry S Truman Education Center has reopened on a limited basis.
 Summer classes are in session, but they are all virtual. The computer lab is available once more, but its traffic flow is vastly curtailed due to social distancing. Also, individuals are limited to one hour on their computer station.
 Michael Dodds, chief of Fort Sill’s Education Services Division, said its location on the fifth floor of the Fort Sill Welcome Center, Building 4700 Mow-Way Road, reopened for customer service June 22.
 “Prior to that we were closed because of the pandemic, and so we were offering services virtually,” he said.
 In the initial stages of the shutdown, a soldier who needed to talk to a counselor could create a trouble ticket and go on Army Education’s database for help. Or a soldier could email a counselor directly for assistance. There was no face-to-face counseling.
 Phone appointments were added when the office reopened June 22. This allows soldiers to talk with counselors over the phone, but not in person.
 “We’re still not doing face-to-face. We’re just not there yet,” Dodds said. “With cases going up we still have to be careful, both employees and customers. And so we’ve implemented procedures to help keep everyone safe.”
 The lobby desk now has a sneeze guard. When soldiers step off the elevator they have to maintain six feet of social distancing wherever they go. The computer where patrons used to check themselves in is gone. Employees have to sign them in.
 “That means only we touch it. So that limits what’s touched,” Dodds said.
 “At the end of the day, we close 30 minutes early now, because we have to have time to clean our area,” he added.
 The people who work the customer service desk sanitize their desks, their chairs and their computer area. Then they go over the computers on the side and the check-in computer as well.
 “They sanitize at the end of the day so when people come up the next day we’re ready to go,” Dodds said.
 The staff reported back June 8, two weeks to the June 22 reopening, to do a deep clean on their side of the fifth floor. They also went over to the Truman Ed Center, Building 3281 in Koehler Loop, and cleansed every classroom, the computer lab, the lobby and the restrooms. That building reopened July 13.
 “The computer lab opened, but it’s very limited. What does that mean?
 “I physically went in there with a tape measure and measured six feet from each computer station. We had to remove 21 computers out of there to meet the six feet social distancing rule. We had 32, I removed 21. So we’ve got 11 in there.
 “I also removed the chairs. So you have to sit behind a laptop. You can’t just pull up a chair next to your buddy and carry on a conversation. And they’re trying to do that, and we have to say, ‘Nope, sorry, you can’t do that, please. You have to maintain six feet social distancing.’ It’s taken them a while to get used to it because some people just want to be social or they want to sit next to their friend,” he noted.
 Prior to the pandemic, approximately 200 people a day visited the Truman Ed Center computer lab.
 “When we opened it back up you can imagine the number of people who wanted to use that facility. But we only had 11 computers, which was a shock to a lot of the customers, because they were used to a whole roomful of computers.
 “So we now had to implement a wait system. If all 11 stations are full you take a number, and we have to limit it to an hour per person to use the computer, so everyone has a chance to go in there and use the computers.”
 The Fort Sill Garrison has memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with seven institutions of higher learning to offer college programs, either virtually or in the classrooms, on post. When the pandemic hit, all seven had to transition to 100 percent online instruction.
 Four of them – Upper Iowa University, Columbia College, Central Texas College and Wayland Baptist University – now plan to offer in-seat classes in Truman Ed Center this fall, but in a blended format – part virtual, part in the classroom. In one example, students will have alternating weeks of online and live classes.
 Two, the University of Oklahoma and Webster University, have said their fall classes will be entirely online. Cameron University has not yet said yes or no to in-seat classes on post this fall.
 All seven are trying to reduce the amount of time spent in the classroom. Meanwhile, Dodds got out his tape measure again to go over the classrooms.
 “We pulled a lot of laptops and chairs out of those rooms to facilitate six feet of social distancing,” he said. “Our biggest classroom is Classroom No. 1. Normally it holds 60 people. There were 60 desks in there, 60 laptops. Right now there are only 15. So that kind of gives you an idea of the magnitude of what we went through to make sure all of our classrooms meet the six feet social distancing rule,” said Dodds.
 The Education Services Division has also limited who can use those classrooms. Prior to the pandemic, military units would call to schedule training in the center’s classrooms. So would MPs, contractors, Department of the Army civilians with other agencies on post and instructors for hazardous materials training. All that stopped, with the exception of some Directorate of Human Resources training.
 “The reason for that is, I am not positioned with enough manpower and resources to clean and sanitize every classroom after every usage,” he explained.
 Each of the seven on-post schools has been assigned one classroom. Only that school will use that classroom. No one else can. Dodds admits that is going to limit the number of classes the seven schools will be able to offer this fall semester.
 “They’ll have to do more online, is what’ll happen, which is the trend anyway. Over 80 percent of Army tuition assistance is used toward online classes now,” Dodds said.
 Each school that has an assigned classroom will now be responsible for cleaning and sanitizing, whether they do it at the end of the day or the first thing next morning. There will be compliance checks to make sure that happens before the classroom is used again. That’s to ensure the safety of employees and students alike.
 “Our testing program just opened up in late June. We moved into our testing facility, and we’re socially distancing our testing area so that people who test will be six feet apart. And you have to wear masks. Masks are mandatory on this floor and in the (Truman Ed Center), in the classrooms and in the computer lab,” Dodds said.
 Monday was the first day back for the Basic Skills Education Program (BSEP). This is the in-seat instruction for General Technical (GT) Improvement, a three-week, half-day course to prep soldiers for retaking the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) in order to score higher. Active-duty military have a similar test called the Armed Forces Classification Test. Achieving a higher score opens doors for soldiers to transition to a different military occupational specialty or change their career path from enlisted to officer through Officer Candidate School, Green to Gold, Warrant Officer School, Criminal Investigation Division School or the medical programs. Dodds said this was a 40-person class before COVID-19. Now it’s down to 10.
 In March 2019 the Truman Ed Center unveiled a remote testing site for the ASVAB. This was a huge boon for recruits and recruiters, as they no longer had to go all the way to Oklahoma City to take the tests. But when the Truman Ed Center closed its doors at the end of March recruiters no longer had access to the building. Dodds said he expects the remote testing site to reopen in either late July or early August. He cautions that there will be fewer computers now, so the most that can be tested at one time is five recruits.
 “Prior to the pandemic they were actually testing every day in there,” he said.
 Dodds said he’s told the Oklahoma City Recruiting Battalion the Truman Ed Center is open again, Monday through Friday, their old room is available, they’re welcome to use it, and here are the rules.
 “Oh, and they have to sanitize their classroom, too, after they use it,” he chuckled.

Footage of Marcella Zoia tossing the chair last year went viral, and her case has attracted widespread media attention in Canada.
 She was handed a $2,000 (US$1,500) fine, sentenced to two years' probation and will be required to carry out 150 hours of community service, but will not serve time in prison.
 Zoia may also be required to attend counseling around the appropriate uses of social media if instructed to do so, a spokesperson for the Ontario Court of Justice told CNN. Her probation order also forbids her from contacting or communicating with two acquaintances.
 She pleaded guilty to mischief endangering life in November. The video, filmed alongside Zoia on the same balcony, shows the then-19-year-old throwing a chair dozens of stories down onto a Toronto highway along which cars were driving. It was captioned "Good morning."

Fatalities of infected children are rare, but they happen. Further, the science around COVID-19 is far from settled; our understanding of the disease is incomplete. There have been serious inflammatory disorders affecting some children after infection with the coronavirus. Physicians and researchers also think there may be serious long-term effects from the disease.
 Then there are adult teachers, administrators, bus drivers, lunchroom workers, and maintenance and cleaning staff at risk. And children go home to their parents, grandparents or some other adult caregiver. Any of those adults are subject to infection by a child who may not appear ill.
 Parson made a point Wednesday of saying he and his family all attended public school, and that his daughter teaches at a public school, as a way to emphasize his concern.
 He also said he “didn’t do a good job of explaining” his point, and later in Wednesday’s comments, added,“We need to do everything we can to make it safe when they go back to school, and that we are ready when the day comes and somebody comes in and they test positive.”
 Public schools are vital for our state. Education is the key to our future. We are willing to give the governor the benefit of the doubt given his stated desire to get kids back to school. Our leaders sometimes say things off the cuff that are ill-considered. While in-person schooling is vital, so is safety.
 We welcome his clarification, but the best use of his and other leaders’ time would be spending the few weeks we have left crafting the safest possible path for our children and communities as we return to schools.

Finding a solution that suits the needs of the entire student body isn’t easy. Students with disabilities, for instance, may not be able to effectively learn via a computer. Elementary students may need face-to-face instruction more so than high school students.
 There doesn’t appear to be a one-size-fits-all model.
 Earlier in July, the Miami-Dade School Board unveiled a tentative plan based on the county reaching Phase 2 reopening status -- a plan that’s informed by public health guidelines and medical expertise on how best to deal with the ongoing Coronavirus crisis.
 Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez and Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, of Miami-Dade County Public Schools, are working together to develop a plan that best suits the community. Included will be input from district parents who just completed a questionnaire noting their preferences.
 “The superintendent and I are very worried about our children returning to school next month unless the spread of the virus is tamped down immediately,” Gimenez said. “I also want to make sure that working parents have options for the school year. But we must have a safe environment.”
 Children who may not even know they have the virus could inadvertently be spreading it to teachers and classmates, their parents and grandparents, “who are at highest risk of severe symptoms and death from COVID-19,” Gimenez said. “That’s why it’s so important for everyone to wear masks, social distance and wash their hands often. It’s up to all of us to change the trajectory of this deadly virus.”
 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and his education secretary have said the state requires schools be reopened.
 “I have no doubt we can do this safely,” DeSantis said to the press in Jacksonville last week. “Different parents have different calculations. If a parent wants to opt for virtual education, they should absolutely be able to do that. We shouldn't be forcing them to make any types of decisions.
 “But I'm confident if you can do Home Depot, if you can do Wal-Mart, if you can do these things, we absolutely can do the schools. I want our kids to be able to minimize this education gap that I think has developed.”
 Meanwhile, in California, where a second wave of Coronavirus has spiked, education officials have announced they will not reopen schools in the fall semester.
 While the matter is obviously complicated, South Florida-based educators who spoke to the Islander News on the basis of anonymity, said in-person instruction is too dangerous, citing deeply limited resources for sanitation and classrooms being a “petri-dish” for spreading germs.
 One educator stressed that kids are not likely to listen and follow safety guidelines, and enforcing them to wear masks all day is not likely. “What do we do when the kids have to go in the hallway after class?”

This list can be a long one.

And today, in a fresh tweet, Shekhar Suman wrote that Sushant’s demise is being used to settle personal scores as he wrote “Our focus has to be just ONE thing.#CBIEnquiryForSSR.I feel his death is being used to settle personal scores,create fake stories for commercial purposes,useless TV debates,enemities,accusations and endless allegations.Have a heart.Just fight for justice.” Well, looks like, Shekhar’s tweet is hinting at Kangana Ranaut after the Queen actress came out in the open in an interview to call out actresses such as Taapsee Pannu and Swara Bhasker as ‘B-grade’ actresses, who don’t get films even after defending Karan Johar. Post Kangana’s remark, Taapsee and Swara took to Twitter to mock Kangana for calling them B grade, and what ensued was a Twitter war between them. Also, in the interview, Kangana had pointed fingers at Karan Johar, Aditya Chopra, Mahesh Bhatt and others for sabotaging Sushant’s career.

In 2017, WE Charity shifted its fiscal year from Jan-Dec, to instead Sept-Aug to align with the academic year on which the organization operates. This resulted in a shortened fiscal year during which, naturally, WE Charity made less revenue than it would than over a full 12-month fiscal year. This shifted when donations were "recognized". This is an accounting principle "on paper only" and the charity lender recognized the situation and willingly waived the respective requirements without any issue or concern on their part.

Chief Smith was an “officer’s Chief” who was able to combine the perfect mixture of leadership with camaraderie. One of the ideals Chief Smith leaned heavily on was knowing that the patrol division is the heart and soul of a police department, and he knew that the department’s success and how the department would be viewed by the public was dependent on the effectiveness of its patrol officers. Chief Smith’s goal was to develop or enhance the most well-equipped, well-trained, community driven patrol officers possible and every single member of the Locust Police Department responded so positively to that leadership.

One of the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings in its most recent and momentous term concerned the religious order the Little Sisters of the Poor and the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act.
   
 The Catholic Diocese of Erie does not come up in the Supreme Court's 7-2 ruling, issued July 8, that upheld the Trump administration's regulations that exempt from the mandate religious organizations such as the Little Sisters.
   
 The Catholic Diocese of Erie still had a role in the case. And no matter what you think about the Supreme Court's decision, a recap reveals how the Erie diocese influenced a contentious legal and social issue.
   
 In May 2012, with Bishop Donald W. Trautman nearing the end of his 20-year tenure, the Catholic Diocese of Erie joined a number of religious organizations nationwide, including the Little Sisters of the Poor, in suing the administration of President Barack Obama over the constitutionality of the contraception mandate, arguing that it violated the groups' rights because they oppose birth control.
   
 The challenges were consolidated, and the case went to the Supreme Court. The lead petitioner was Pittsburgh Catholic Bishop David Zubik.
   
 The Catholic Diocese of Erie remained a petitioner. And when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case, on March 23, 2016, current Erie Catholic Bishop Lawrence Persico and I were in the audience when Erie Catholic Charities was mentioned during the justices' questions.
   
 The Zubik case was decided in a strange fashion on May 16, 2106. Lacking a ninth member due to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, an apparently deadlocked Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower courts. The justices asked the government and the religious organizations, including the Catholic Diocese of Erie, to work out a compromise.
   
 A compromise never happened.
   
 After Donald Trump took office as president, he ended the Zubik case in October 2017. His administration said any organization or business, religious or otherwise, can refuse insurance coverage for contraception if they object to it on religious or moral grounds.
   
 The Zubik case was over. The dispute was not. The states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey sued over the Trump regulations, leading to the appeal that sent the new case of the Little Sisters of the Poor to the Supreme Court.
   
 The nuns' biggest ally turned out to be Donald Trump. On a smaller scale, the Catholic Diocese of Erie played a part, too.

It is easy to say “Send them back no matter what” and “Parents need life to get back to normal," but when you are facing the reality of being stuck inside a building with 800 people, the whole debate becomes much less abstract. It becomes terrifying. While most educators are used to the lack of respect that this country generally – and the Trump administration particularly – extends toward its teachers, this latest slight is especially alarming. Is anyone worried about whether we will get sick or asymptomatically carry COVID-19 back to our own kids and families? Will we be forced to return to the petri dish of public school no matter the cost? Are we just going to give it a whirl and wait and see? Will it take more teachers and children getting sick or dying for us to realize that returning to school isn’t safe yet?

MAS has been regulating digital asset companies under the recently enacted Payment Services Act, which came into effect in January 2020. This act governs cryptocurrency companies that are located in and do business only in Singapore. The financial watchdog is now looking to monitor entities that are based in Singapore and conduct business overseas.
