I spent my formative years in a number of cities and that must have influenced my cosmopolitan view of life. I spent some part of my life in a place called Azumini in Abia State, where we had a plantation settlement. I spent some time in Aba, the commercial city of Abia State. I was in Port Harcourt at different times and in Kaduna and in North Western Nigeria. Those were the principal places I spent my formative years and I am always proud to say that it must have influenced my cosmopolitan disposition. I don't relate with people on the basis of where they come from or their background. I lived with both the high and mighty and the very low people in the society. I have encountered both the poor and the rich, smart and dull people, Muslims and Christians, and I have lived in different cultures and geographical regions, which shaped who I am. It has made me more accommodative of people and to understand diversity. I am able to relate and integrate with all manner of people.

Everybody in life desires things. There are things I desire like anyone else with modest vision. What differentiates people is the way we go about the pursuit of our vision and heart’s desires. My way to go about my heart’s desires is to pray to the Almighty God, draw up a plan, work towards it, be very determined, give my best and ask for people's support. There is no big vision you would accomplish without people’s support but first that vision must be yours. To work for the realisation of that vision is yours, no one can envision for you. It is your responsibility to identify your vision, you must be passionate about the vision, you must formulate a plan to accomplish the vision and other people can only support you to achieve that vision of yours. So, I have clear vision of the kind of things I want to accomplish in life. I have my plans well documented on how to accomplish the vision and from time to time, I would ask for support wherever I need it. I have no doubt that God will help me accomplish those visions of mine before I am called to the other side of the world.

"Let Nigerians note, more than five months after the courts vindicated me by quashing all charges of corruption levelled against me, the Nigerian state through the EFCC has refused to return my properties unlawfully taken from me under those charges. Not one of those charges is still standing, yet the EFCC has refused to do the right thing. Our peaceful protest today (yesterday) is to raise a cry against this injustice in our land", he said.

GriefShare groups use workbooks that cost about $15, but if attendees can’t afford it, some churches will foot the bill. They also use videos, which Saunders likes.


  One of the videos touches on a common question grieving people ask: Why?


  “You’re not going to get the answer why, but you’re going to understand where God is in your journey of grief,” Saunders said.


  To support each other from a distance, she recommends video chatting versus phone calls or texting, and being specific when reaching out.
