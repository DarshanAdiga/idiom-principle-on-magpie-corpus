But Charu Asopra's Instagram post says otherwise. And this had led to a flood of comments below the actress' post where fans are asking her to stay strong during these troubled times.

Give hydroxy a chance, and please don't contribute to hydroxy hysteria because if it's prescribed under the supervision of a doctor, the odds that it can harm you are way, way smaller than the odds that it can help you, Navarro said.

The idea that this is a dangerous drug is just silly, but if you ask the American people based on the media's coverage of it, that is kind of the state of play right now, he said.

It also has an anti-inflammatory effect, which is why it is used for rheumatoid arthritis, and the drug can therefore also help manage what is called the cytokine storm, he said.

He said if one looks at the 14-day arc of the virus from the beginning of symptoms, the first seven days are critical: when a person may have fever, dry cough, possibly a profound sense of fatigue.

One, for early treatment use in a hospital setting. Number two, treatment between a doctor and his patient in an outpatient setting. Three, not just as a therapeutic but also as a possible prophylaxis for preventative use, he said.

Jos Buttler Vs Kemar Roach


--DocBreak--
Buttler might not have enjoyed a great run Test cricket in recent times. However, the wicket-keeper batsman certainly has the capability to change the course of the game in no time and the visitors must be aware of the fact. Nevertheless, West Indies have the services of Kemar Roach who can move the ball both ways and that too with the brisk pace. Also, the right-arm pacer is just seven scalps away from completing 200 Test wickets and he’ll look to achieve the feat in the first Test only.

If the results of the Detroit study are confirmed in later studies, President Trump was absolutely right that hydroxychloroquine can save lives and if in fact early treatment use can lead to a 50 per cent reduction in mortality that is tens of thousands of American lives that are at stake by a phenomenon which I call hydroxy hysteria, Navarro said.

James Anderson Vs Kraigg Brathwaite


--DocBreak--
The first was what is called a black box warning, the second was a withdrawal of an EUA and what I can tell you as someone who works with the Health and Human Services Department and FEMA to manage the stockpiles of hydroxychloroquine the FDA decisions that they made which I think were precipitous and based on bad science had a tremendously negative effect on two things, he noted.


--DocBreak--
Veteran England pacer James Anderson seems to have aged like wine and is only getting better with time. The right-arm pacer will aim to swing the brand new red cherry in order to pierce the defences of Windies batsmen. However, Caribbean opener Kraigg Brathwaite will have the onus to neutralize the Anderson effect and give his side a good start with the bat.

This has become highly politicised, but India uses this widely for prophylaxis. There are a number of studies which point to this actually working, Navarro said.

The official said if he were to show any kind of symptoms, he would first ask his doctor whether hydroxychloroquine is appropriate. And then I wouldn't hesitate to take it, he said.

_Coolie No 1_ is the upcoming comedy drama that is directed by David Dhawan. The makers had initially planned to release this family entertainer on May 1, 2020, which was also Labours Day. But owing to the coronavirus pandemic, the film had be pushed back. In an interview to a leading entertainment portal, a source has talked about the new release date of _Coolie No 1_ and also why the makers have turned down the OTT option.

This request to the FDA comes on the heels of the publication of their study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases last week that showed an astonishing 50 percent reduction in the mortality rate for patients taking hydroxychloroquine, Navarro said.

FDA's previous decision to reject the emergency use authorisation, he said, was based on two types of studies. One set of studies that were poorly designed and basically doomed to failure, another set of studies where if you look carefully at the data it is very clear that these were late treatment studies where the medicine would not work, he added.


--DocBreak--
Navarro said the Detroit doctors are bringing back to the FDA a clear case for early treatment.

Kazakh model Yevgeniya Mukasheva shared the video saying, "If an animal comes close to you, it means it trusts you. How could you throw stones at the defenceless pup and laugh? Have you lost your mind?!" Saken Dildakhmet, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Ecology, Geology and Natural Resources was quoted as saying, "The way people acted in the video is outrageous and wild. Such an attitude can cause great damage to the fauna of the Caspian Sea and adversely affect the behaviour of these animals who may become aggressive and attack people. We ask you to show respect to nature."

Dildakhmet said, "The seal in the clip is young and playful. The seals are mostly very friendly and curious marine mammals. We should admire them." Last month in Mangistau region there were incidents of people being but by seals. Children and adults had to be rushed to the hospital and were given a rabies shot. In another incident, video of a tourist hitting a sleeping seal with slippers to wake it up had angered netizens. The incident reportedly happened at Cape Cross beach in Namibia of south-western Africa.

The latest request to the FDA also comes on the heels of two decisions by the FDA over the last several months to shut down hydroxychloroquine.

Navarro said a day earlier four doctors at the Detroit Hospital System filed a request for emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine. The request was for three things.

At that point, your lungs are still intact, and the virus is not appreciably spread to the rest of your organs. Hydroxychloroquine, based on the science in articles like the one that originally appeared in 2005 in the Journal of Virology, works in a therapeutic way by raising the alkalinity of your cells which slows the replication of the virus and also can kill the virus, he said.
