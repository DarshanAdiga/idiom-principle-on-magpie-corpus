"Had the appropriate course of action been followed for these false allegations, it would have clearly demonstrated that anything related to Sussex Royal, Travalyst, or any of the duke's charitable endeavours is transparent and above board.
 "To suggest otherwise is unequivocally wrong and will be acted upon accordingly with the weight of the law. The avenue through which this was publicly and salaciously created only suggests a hunger for media attention as well as a shared and attacking agenda, which is neither right nor just.
 "Both The Charity Commission's own statement today, as well as that of The Royal Foundation, state there is no determination of wrongdoing here.
 "All of the Duke's charitable activities are fully transparent as well as compliant with Charity Commission guidelines, and moreover with his own moral compass."

The tourism industry bears the brunt of the border lockdown, leaving hotels and resorts empty. Reduced mobility is also reflected in domestic transport. Restaurants and Catering businesses are facing weak demand as many booked functions and events get canceled. The total number of container registrations decreased by 89 registrations (10.1%) over the month owing to a decline in business containers for wholesale and retail businesses. Meanwhile, private containers slightly rose as they benefit from import duty exemptions as part of the government's relief package for the pandemic and TC Harold.

July 20 (Reuters) - British music magazine Q is folding after 34 years in business as the coronavirus epidemic accelerated a downturn in the media sector, forcing the publication to cease operations.
 The monthly magazine's editor, Ted Kessler, announced its closure in a tweet https://bit.ly/2WEKJsw on Monday, saying that the coronavirus pandemic hurt the magazine's business.
 Q was the latest outlet in the media and publishing industry to be hit by the pandemic. British newspaper publisher Reach Plc and broadcaster BBC recently announced a series of job cuts.
 "I must apologise profusely for my failure to keep Q afloat," Kessler said in an editor's letter for the final issue. "We've been a lean operation for all of my tenure, employing a variety of ways to help keep our head above water in an extremely challenging print market. Covid-19 wiped all that out."
 The final issue will be published on July 28.
 Germany-based Bauer Media Group, which is the parent company for Q, listed the music magazine for sale in May following a sharp decline in sales and advertising revenue during the pandemic.
 Bauer Media said Modern Classics would also cease to operate as the company was unable to find new buyers for the two publications.
 Founded in 1986 by music journalists Mark Ellen and David Hepworth, Q gained popularity with its long-form pieces on the British rock and alternative scenes.
 English Indie band The Vaccines and musician Tim Burgess joined the chorus of the magazine's music-loving readers on social media expressing disappointment about its closure.
 The upcoming final issue, titled "Adventures with legends 1986 to 2020," compiles some of the magazine's best interviews, including with David Bowie, Joni Mitchell and Prince. (Reporting by Aakriti Bhalla in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Cooney)

Bloomberg Opinion) -- After a burst of stimulus that dramatically lowered interest rates and put a floor under the global financial system, central banks face a new coronavirus challenge: winning the peace.
 Monetary authorities have to manage a recovery that’s less vigorous than once hoped — no one’s talking about a V-shaped rebound anymore. Officials need to acknowledge that after a flurry of activity since March, the bulk of initiatives is behind them. This doesn't signify the end of easy money, not by a long shot. What it does mean is that the precedent-shattering speed and scope of action is unlikely to be repeated. It’s about going from an emergency response to settling in for the long haul.
 A key challenge will be balancing dour outlooks with caution about loosening conditions further. This tension was on display in Japan and South Korea in the past week. Both central banks were less optimistic about the road ahead but appeared content to stand pat. In China, meanwhile, monetary policy makers have hinted they want to remove some of the special tools deployed to stimulate the economy during the peak of the outbreak, while keeping a steady supply of credit to businesses. Threading this needle requires delicacy and discipline.
 In practical terms, policy is complicated by wariness of asset bubbles. The Bank of Korea admitted to a worsening economic picture, but is also keeping an eye on an overheating real estate market. The average apartment price in Seoul is up more than 50% in the past three years, a climb exacerbated by rock- bottom interest rates and ample liquidity. The government last month unveiled a raft of measures to combat the surge, including property-tax increases. Across China, meanwhile, wealthy buyers are snapping up luxury apartments and the stock market has been on a tear. The central bank central bank will want to find a way to stamp this out while giving the economy room to gather strength. The rebound, glimpsed last quarter, is half done. Gross domestic product rose 3.2% in the April-to-June period, better than the prior quarter’s rout, but far from the 6.1% notched in 2019. While Japan isn’t facing a property bubble — not since a spectacular bust three decades ago — it has other constraints. For one, it already owns about half the market for government bonds. And though Japan has been a monetary policy pioneer, as the first major economy to adopt yield curve control and massive-scale quantitative easing, these approaches didn’t deliver the hoped-for economic bounce. It's hard to believe foraging deeper into the policy wilderness — against the backdrop of the coronavirus, no less — will prove any more fruitful. Now, the Bank of Japan is even more pessimistic. It projected a deeper slump this year when policy makers met last week, and left its stance unchanged for a second time. While Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is still holding out hopes for a decent bounce, it’s from a “deep trough," he said.The solution is likely to mean a revved-up role for forward guidance, the art of telling investors what you will — or won't — do for some time in the future. The beauty of this tool is you can affect sentiment without actually doing a lot. Such hand-holding became popular after the global financial crisis, but less so in recent years. As the Federal Reserve raised rates in 2017 and 2018, some officials lost enthusiasm for telegraphing in too much detail; better to keep things a bit vague as the peak approached. As trade wars buffeted growth and Covid-19 spread, it only grew harder to convey assurances.
 The truth is, major economies are going to need prolonged support even if a repeat of the second quarter’s historic implosion isn’t in the cards. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor and one of the system’s most influential officials, painted a dark picture of the economy last week, saying it would be “appropriate” to shift monetary policy from “stabilization to accommodation.” It’s already become clear that growth in the third quarter will be prone to setbacks.
 The danger with the stasis we’re seeing in Asia is that loose words risk conveying the wrong idea. The last thing investors need in a pandemic is a repeat of the 2013 taper tantrum, when markets took a nosedive after suggestions the Fed would start tapping the brakes on bond buying. Rates didn’t begin to rise until late 2015, and then only very gradually. Kuroda dropped periodic hints that he wanted to inch toward an exit, as I wrote here, but events usually conspired against him. Not doing more isn’t necessarily a precursor to doing less. The risk for policy makers is that having acted heroically at the start of the pandemic, merely hanging around might be perceived as mission accomplished. Getting the right message across may be a task better suited to a linguist than any economist.

NACOGDOCHES, Texas (KTRE) - A man who used a pair of kitchen scissors to rob a Lufkin convenience store back in January has agreed to a plea bargain deal of 12 years in a Texas Department of Criminal Justice prison.Clifton Tatum, of Lufkin, appeared in Judge Paul White’s 159 Judicial District Court on Friday for a plea hearing. As part of the plea bargain deal, Tatum pleaded guilty to an aggravated robbery charge.The crime occurred at the Big’s convenience store located at 1203 S. Chestnut on Jan. 5.“The store clerk said that a regular (though she did not know his name) came into the store and asked to buy beer that was not in the display cooler,” a Lufkin PD press release stated. “She had to go to the back of the store to get the beer. When she returned to the register area, she said, the man followed her around the counter.”At that point, Tatum “aggressively” pulled out a sharp object and told the clerk, “Just cooperate.” He gestured for the store employee to put the beer in a bad and told her to open the registers. She did and put the money in the bag, along with the three packs of cigarettes that he had demanded.“She said she then told him she had kids and didn’t want to be hurt, but he told her they were no longer talking. “She said he told her to go into the store’s freezer/cooler area and count to 100 before coming out. He left on foot toward East Denman Avenue.”LPD officers reviewed the store’s surveillance footage, and it showed the incident just as the store clerk had described. They put out an image of the suspect, so other Lufkin PD officers could be on the lookout for him.A Lufkin officer recognized the man in the video as Tatum, who is a registered sex offender.Lufkin PD officers then went to a home where Tatum had been known to stay. While they were searching the area, they found a vacant house at 1011 Mitchell Avenue with an unsecured back door.“Officers found Tatum inside the house less than an hour later. He was still wearing the same clothes and had several beers on the floor around him,” the press release stated. “Officers also found a pair of kitchen scissors that he apparently used to threaten the store clerk. They found an undisclosed amount of cash in his shorts pocket that matched what was taken from the register.”Tatum was arrested for aggravated robbery and taken to the county jail.Copyright 2020 KTRE.

Tencent adapted QQ to the smartphone with considerable success – today, it has 650m MAUs. In what was probably the most inspired strategic business decision of all time, it also set up an internal competition to develop a mobile-first chat app from the ground up. The winner was Weixin, known as WeChat in English, and the rest is history.

The person now has the right type of experience to do it better. But mind you, it is not that all that is preaching for a new shift now did it wrongly when they were there. You must bear in mind the offices they occupied then. Some were in offices where they were mere advisers and if your boss did not take your good advice or refused to implement it what do you do? But be that as it may, what we want for the country now is for everybody to move in a prospective direction that can help the country devoid of tribal interest, devoid of corruption, devoid of hate speeches, devoid of racism, killing and maiming and putting the country in very difficult light, all of these things are what we want to change and if we can change at least 60-65 per cent of this particular travail we find ourselves, the country will have a different lease of life.

 WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, under fire over his administration's response to the surging coronavirus, said on Monday he will resume holding news briefings on the pandemic after a lengthy hiatus.
 He told reporters in the Oval Office the resumption was prompted by a "big flareup in Florida, Texas, a couple of other places." The virus has killed 140,000 Americans and infected some 3.7 million, both figures leading the world.
 White House debate has centered on whether Trump should risk doing daily briefings after he was mocked for musing that people might inject household disinfectants as a way to protect themselves from contracting the virus.
 The briefings ended in early May after the new White House of chief staff, Mark Meadows, sought a new focus for the president's messaging on the subject.
 In the weeks since, the Republican Trump has received negative reviews and fallen in opinion polls for a seemingly hands-off approach to the pandemic. He has lost ground to Democrat Joe Biden, his presumptive rival in the Nov. 3 election.
 Last Friday Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters she favored a return of the briefings, which she said had bolstered his approval ratings.
 White House advisers say Trump's daily appearances could put pressure on Biden, who has limited his campaign appearances amid the country's struggle to control the pandemic.
 Trump said he expected the first new briefing would take place about 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) on Tuesday.
 "We're going to give you a lot of briefings over the next week and the next few weeks," he said.
 He said he would bring in the heads of some companies involved in the search for vaccines and other treatments for the virus, such as Johnson & Johnson. (Reporting by Steve Holland; Editing by Howard Goller)

Our new location will be more convenient for people wanting to pick up a quick prescription refill, visiting one of our on campus clinics, or the Emergency Department,” says Michael Sandsmark, PharmD, Director of Iroquois Memorial Hospital Pharmacy. “We offer many other services to our patients including free same-day prescription delivery, medication-therapy management, and Medicare Part D plan comparisons. If you have to visit the hospital, we also offer bedside delivery of your medications before you even leave the hospital. This eliminates the need to make another stop on the way home after surgery or discharge from the hospital. We hope this service helps patients recover at home faster and reduces the burden on caregivers.”

One could not avoid noticing that in addition to the specific objections to the _Harper’s_ letter, its critics were animated by an unusually strong, almost personal, animus to the letter-writers. They constantly brought up the fact that they were wealthy, popular, liberal, and non-minority — even when they weren’t. Much of it was ideological hostility, of course, but it seemed also to be allied to a kind of class hatred, and perhaps to a sense of inferiority of some kind too. There’s a long and impressive tradition of rhetorical viciousness on the Left; Marx himself had a real talent for invective, and Brecht too. And eventually I thought I sensed what they were saying behind the formal arguments:

Updates with start of White House meeting)
 By David Morgan and Doina Chiacu
 WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats are prepared to block Republicans from moving forward on a partisan coronavirus aid bill, the chamber's top Democrat warned on Monday, as Republican leaders met at the White House to discuss legislation.
 The Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-led House of Representatives have less than two weeks to hammer out a new relief package before enhanced unemployment benefits run out for tens of millions of American workers made jobless by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy visited the White House on Monday morning to discuss legislation with President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, according to a Republican Senate aide.
 But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans not to try to move forward on their own legislation, saying Senate and House Democrats would unite to demand bipartisan action.
 "We will stand together again if we must," Schumer said in a letter to colleagues. "A bipartisan, bicameral process will result in a much better bill for the American people."
 Congress has so far passed legislation committing $3 trillion to the crisis. In the more than 12 weeks since Trump signed the last response law, the number of U.S. coronavirus cases has more than tripled to over 3.7 million.
 Similar partisan standoffs preceded the last bills.
 Senate Republican plans to unveil a coronavirus bill this week have been upstaged by a White House effort to eliminate billions of dollars for coronavirus testing and tracing from the legislation.
 "That goes beyond ignorance. It's just beyond the pale. Hopefully, it was a mistake and they'll back off it, because it is so very wrong," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told MSNBC.
 Republicans and Democrats appear to be far apart on what should be included in the next coronavirus package.
 Republicans have circulated draft documents laying out liability protections for businesses, schools, government agencies and charities.
 Democrats, who oppose liability protections, have pledged to fight for legislation akin to the $3 trillion bill that the House approved in mid-May. McConnell has said his bill would not cost more than $1 trillion. (Reporting by Doina Chiacu and David Morgan; Editing by Scott Malone and Jonathan Oatis)

 The nonprofit fought for the school to remain open in 2004 and helped persuade the Charleston County School District to build a new one in 2012. Most of Metanoia’s $20 million-plus financing package would have come from tax credits, and while any delay will create extra costs, Mr. Stanfield remains determined.
 The Chicora school project is important because Metanoia realizes it’s in a race against time. Given what has taken place on Charleston’s peninsula and North Charleston’s East Montague Avenue, many expect this part of North Charleston eventually will gentrify, too, forcing up land values and rents.
 And for Metanoia, such a resurgence is both a goal and a central challenge. The nonprofit is seeking to revitalize the southern part of North Charleston but to do so in a way that ensures residents participate in and benefit from that resurgence. If new job opportunities, child care options and other improvements don’t keep pace with rising rents and land prices, the chances for that participation dim. It already had plans for more affordable housing near the school, anticipating that its renovation eventually would change a blighted spot into a bright spot.
 “Once the big money shows up, things are sort of done for,” Mr. Stanfield says. “We want to stay ahead of that curve. ... When it happens, it happens extremely quickly.”
 In the past few months, this community — along with the rest of the nation and the world, for that matter — has wrestled with the strains and uncertainties surrounding COVID-19. While it’s important that we all pull together to get through these difficult times, we also should do what we can to ensure worthy projects don’t get lost along the way.

These dollars will provide much needed relief by assisting with costs such as PPE, rent, mortgage expenses, supplier payments, utilities and sanitation supplies” said Chair to the Board Charlie Stacy.
 The grant is broken down into three industry segments – restaurant, retail and general commerce, with each segment receiving a $100,000 allotment. Distribution of restaurant and retail funding was determined by the number of categorized businesses within the towns and county. General commerce was based on the town and county’s population.

Diverse le iniziative che abbracciano il settore della comunicazione. Sono stati realizzati due spot promozionali da 15” ciascuno dal titolo Basilicata En plein air - Una regione dai colori autentici rappresentativi delle principali destinazioni per il turismo all’aria aperta e una serie di dieci cortometraggi dal titolo Ten good reasons to come Basilicata(Dieci buone ragioni per venire in Basilicata), ovvero 10 ragioni per 10 episodi per scoprire la Basilicata attraverso gli occhi di Matt, un giovane turista esploratore (l’attore Matt Sonnino) che racconta il suo viaggio in Basilicata in lingua inglese (sottotitoli in italiano). Molto incoraggianti sono i dati rinvenienti dalle campagne Google che riguardano i canali social – Facebook e Instagram – e il portale web www.basilicataturistica.it.   La progettazione delle azioni finalizzate al raggiungimento degli obiettivi delineati è stata inevitabilmente attraversata, e dunque “plasmata”, dalle conseguenze della emergenza Covid-19. Uno dei settori più colpiti dalla crisi economica generata dalla lunga fase di lockdown, come è noto, è proprio quello del turismo che ha visto anche in Basilicata pressoché azzerarsi le prenotazioni di viaggio e soggiorno a partire dalla primavera del 2020, facendo registrare una timida ripresa fra giugno e luglio, con dati comunque poco confortanti se comparati ai flussi turistici dell’anno precedente.   In questo contesto di grande incertezza è stato fondamentale l’impegno della Regione Basilicata, cui APT ha fornito un sostegno e un supporto tecnico qualificato e costante sotto l’impulso diretto del Presidente Bardi. La Basilicata, per le azioni di prevenzione e contenimento poste in essere, è la regione a minori contagi d’Italia. L’intervento a tutela del settore turistico ricettivo messo in campo dall’Assessorato alle Attività Produttive ha visto un impegno di 53 milioni di euro. Le iniziative di promozione poste in essere dall’Assessorato all’Ambiente hanno consentito il lancio di una serie di puntate di Linea Verde Tour, nuovo format Rai dedicato al turismo lento, verde ed esperienziale. L’impegno per il raccordo delle attività di comunicazione vede un costante confronto con l’Assessorato all’Agricoltura. L’Assessorato alla Sanità sta mettendo in campo azioni direttamente rivolte agli operatori del settore turistico-ricettivo. L’azione APT è inoltre in costante raccordo con l’Ufficio Sistemi Culturali e Turistici e, per quanto attiene alle coperture finanziarie delle rispettive attività, con il Dipartimento Programmazione e Finanze.

If I am responsible for the defense of anyone or anything, I zealously represent it.”
 He continued, “I am not perfect, and I have never claimed to be. I am, however, a professional deserving of respect. In my prior dealings with the Smyth County Board of Library Trustees, I have received due respect and returned it. I was not treated with respect by the majority of Board members last Thursday. We have a joint responsibility toward this library. My staff and I have diligently represented it. Most of the Library Trustees have also. For this new relationship to continue in a positive manner, respect and commitment to our duty must be there on all our parts. If that’s not what this new Board wants, it wants a figurehead, a puppet, or a scapegoat. I am none of those things. I leave it to the Board as to how they wish to proceed.”
 On Friday, Farmer said, “I’m sorry they chose not to get to know me and the library before they made these moves.”
 He emphasized that he has no regrets. “If you’re doing what you believe in for the right reasons, you have no regrets.”
 Farmer was full of praise for his employees at the three branches and especially of how dedicated and creative they’ve been during the pandemic, introducing online Storytimes, summer reading programs and activities, and providing curbside service.
 He expressed concern that none of the new trustees asked him about the staff or library operations.
 Farmer is concerned about directives put in place by the trustees, including the addition of “no loitering” signs outside the Marion branch. He noted that when the library closed to the public as a result of COVID-19, it did switch on its WiFi 24/7 for citizens to use. He also noted that the library is open to all citizens, noting that some officials had complained about a homeless man’s use of the institution.
 The 52-year-old Farmer isn’t sure what he’ll do next. He acknowledges that he knew controversy swirled around the library when he applied for the job. Family even asked him if he was sure he wanted to get involved with the library system, which was then hiring a new director after its previous one retired amid a series of questions and investigations about its operations.
 At the time of his hiring, Farmer said he saw that citizens cared about the library system, that they respected it as an important community institution. “That sold it for me,” he said.
 Moving from Sitka, Alaska, Farmer was returning to the library that helped shape him as a child. Friday, he said, “I came to help the library I started out at age 5.”
 The library trustees did not announce an interim director or plans for hiring a new director Thursday. The library staff does not include an assistant director.
 While confident in the staff, Farmer expressed concerns about reports due to the state library and a federal grant.
 On his last day, Farmer helped with curbside service in Chilhowie and with training a new employee, who he said has strong librarian skills. “I was doing the work we do to help people,” he said.
 “I will miss helping people,” he concluded.

Perhaps right-wingers would like to threaten free expression, but their social power to do so in universities, the media, publishing, Big Tech, and wherever else these conflicts are raging is so minuscule that they are being canceled with greater ease and less publicity than are liberals and moderate leftists.

Amukamara's presence might ease some of the pressure placed on Arnette's shoulders, though, setting up for a smoother transition that could pay off in the long run for the Silver and Black.

No, no, if they are on top of the security, how can Boko Haram be doing what they are doing? Even yesterday (Monday), 15 people were killed, today (Tuesday) another 18 people were killed in Katsina, the state of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. If they can attack the president’s state and be doing the way they are doing and then coming into the state with relish, nobody is stopping them, and even abducting the local government chairman with one woman, then how can anyone say that they are on top of the matter? It is either that their intelligence failed them or inaptitude in the task on hand or incapacitation of what they are doing on the people or lack of chain and command. And I find it so difficult to believe why Mr. President uptil now did not find it fit to have sacked or relieved these Service Chiefs of their positions? Why? I don’t just get it and then he finds it so comfortable to be living in this particular denial that they are doing something. What they promised, in the beginning, was that in less than six months they will take away Boko Haram, but now look at it, it is getting equivalent to six years, we are still doing the same thing. We cannot uptil now think, and some of these people (Boko Haram) will come out and make public statements, boasting that they are coming to attack you or your community and they will still come and do the attack, ferocious one, and still get away, nobody will do anything. Now everybody is almost on his own, getting security on his own to protect oneself. This cannot continue. It is because of the failure of the state that every zone is strategizing and agitating to get the presidency position. Look, had it been that, probably when Jonathan was the president of the country, that everybody was satisfied with how things were being run, do you think there will be this strong agitation from all groups for a shift in presidency from one particular part of the country to another? No. Had it been also that the present president (Buhari) has done or being sincere with ways of uniting this country together how we ought to have been united, and people working together in fairness, equity, and justice, do you think people will worry about a shift in power? Do you think, let’s say the president’s kitchen cabinet has an Igbo man, Yoruba man, Nupe man etc, do you think anybody will be agitating when they find out that they are carried along, that they belong, that they are treated equally as Nigerians? But the truth is that merit is the key, anybody that has the capacity to lead us out of this particular wood is what we want irrespective of where he comes from: North, South, East, South-South etc, does not really matter. Unfortunately, because of these denials, or probably segregation, etc with some people believing that they have not been given the opportunity to lead this country, it has now led to different agitations that we are seeing today with different zones wanting to get there (Presidency). It is not because of this shifting position that made me say that an Igbo should lead this country, no. My support for the Southeast is for them to at least give us some of that particular intelligence capacity that they have, share it with the country so that Nigeria can move forward. But unfortunately too, my brothers in the Southeast are not playing the politics that ought to be played. They are very good at doing their trade, they are everywhere in this country, why can’t they use that particular capacity to mobilise their friends everywhere rather than having hate and make enemies? You cannot lead a country when you already show a complete denial to belong to that country, nobody will trust you. This is a fact, but once you show that your capacity is for the interest of the country, you will win the trust of others. Let me tell you, we have capable individuals in the Southeast who have shown love, equity, and reliability if given opportunity. Can you believe the capacity of our Eastern brothers who during even the civil war were producing planes, armoured tanks? So, you can imagine the in-depth of the capacity they have. Other regions also have their attributes and what they can bring on board to make Nigeria great. So, we need one another. We need to go back to history to make our corrections. I am seriously interested in having an Eastern president, but our people in the East need to play the right type of politics and then show that Nigeria is in their mind. There is no gainsaying, every part of this country has been offended, but we need to be careful the way we tackle it. Remember the kind of exposé that was given by Zakary of CNN. He said that Nigerians are too much in their ingenuity, they are doing wonderfully well in America, and in other countries of the world, imagine if we bring all of this resourcefulness together, nobody, can beat us. The man who thought me mathematics is the best neurosurgeon in Russia, he is a Hausa man from Kano, but now when you look for them you can’t find them here, you have to start looking for them in America, Britain, Russia etc, we need to put our country together as a people, that is paramount for us. We must have that trust and believe in ourselves to be able to move this country forward.

They are not in control of whether it happens; the virus is in control of whether it happens. It could be delayed again, or Los Angeles County could be shut down altogether. We'd love to think that a show like this establishes some sort of special arrangement with the State of California, but that's probably not happening. What makes this show so special?

Of course, I feel sad and worried, that was the reason the majority of us refused to keep quiet and ready to move along and work together with other like-minds so that we can move out of this particular quagmire. The question is that everybody is complaining that things are not done right and every day you find out one group or the other demonstrating, protesting. Initially, when it started it was like child’s play. The Niger-Delta Volunteer Force started with the agitation for self-control and all that, we then had the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC), at the end of the day we are now having what we are witnessing from Boko Haram, how they are ravaging everywhere, so every part of this country have agitated for one thing or the other, wrongly or rightly it has affected the people and then the country from moving, so the complaint is so much so that we need to do something as quickly as possible before it consumes all of us.

The Cambridge City School District and East Guernsey Local School District will delay the start of the 2020-21 school year until Tuesday, Sept. 8, according to press releases from both superintendents Friday.  
 "We have looked closely at the guidelines provided by the state, we have talked to the Guernsey County Health Department and we have received valuable input from our school families," said Superintendent Dan Coffman. "Taking all of that input into consideration as well as input from our staff and teachers, we have decided to move the start of the school year to after Labor Day for students."  
 But that news only applies to students in the East Guernsey District where all employees will begin the school year on Aug. 17.  
 "This will give the faculty and staff time to utilize professional development related to various instruction, operation and health and safety topics," said Superintendent Adam Pittis. "We will take this time to prepare the school buildings and classrooms in order to provide the safest environment possible.  
 "Additionally, the later start will allow for the district to appropriately stock specialized cleaning supplies and Personal Protective Equipment for our employees and students," added Pittis.  
 As of Friday, no final decisions have been made in regards to the delivery model for instruction for the 2020-2021 school year in either district.  
 The East Guernsey district is preparing to provide three different educational options -- face to face classroom learning, 100% remote learning and a weekly hybrid of face to face learning and remote learning.  
 "It is likely the district will start the school year utilizing the hybrid model," said Pittis. "And, I believe it is realistic that we could end up educating students using all three models that we are looking at this school year."  
 Coffman said Cambridge leaders are also considering three different educational options for the 2020-2021 school year including face to face classes at school on a full-time basis following health and safety protocols, remote learning or a combination of face to face and remote learning.  
 It is possible that more than one option will be available to students.  
 "We have not made any decisions yet on what option or options we will offer when the school year begins, but we are preparing for all of these options," Coffman said. "To give our staff and faculty time to prepare for the school year, we felt it was in our best interest to delay the start of the school year."  
 A proposal for the Cambridge board of education to consider the July 21 meeting would have teachers beginning on Aug. 26 to give them time to participate in staff development activities to learn new software and expand their technology skills.  
 "Many of our teachers are not as familiar with online teaching tools as they will need to be for this school year, so we will utilize professional development days to bring them up to speed," Coffman said.  
 The preparation time all will allow teachers and maintenance staff time to make modifications to the school buildings and classrooms to ensure the safety of students, teachers, and staff. These modifications include adding sanitation stations, adding protective shields, and rearranging of rooms to meet health and safety guidelines.  
 Cambridge, like many school districts, are also ordering specialized cleaning supplies and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for employees and students.  
 "Moving the start date back ensures that we will have all the appropriate PPE and supplies to protect our students and employees when we return to the school buildings," Coffman said.  
 In the East Guernsey district, more than 800 responses have been received to a district survey regarding the start of the school year.  
 These results are consistent with the communication that has been provided to the district in recent months with 58% of respondents indicating they would like to return to school following health and safety protocols, while 42% prefer a hybrid or remote learning. The district plans to make a final announcement next week regarding the plans for the 2020-2021 school year.  
 "We greatly appreciate the patience of all East Guernsey stakeholders during these difficult times," said Pittis.  
 As for surveys in the Cambridge district, more than 700 were completed by Wednesday with approximately 60% of the respondents indicating they would like to return to school following health and safety protocols while just over 30% like a remote learning environment.  
 "The results of the survey support what we have heard anecdotally this spring and summer," Coffman said. "Based on the results, we seriously are considering offering both in-classroom and remote learning options. We want our students and their families to feel safe, secure and comfortable with the learning environment they chose this fall.  
 "We plan to make an announcement next week regarding the learning options and the protocols we will follow this coming school year. We ask that our families please be patient as we adopt to a new normal. Even with a well thought out plan in place, I am sure we will be making adjustments almost daily as we figure out the safest way for students to receive their education," concluded Coffman.  
 Multiple attempts to contact Rolling Hills Superintendent Scott Golec at the district office on Friday were unsuccessful.

The fracture between the supervisors and Farmer took a public turn in June when the county published its proposed 2020-21 budget and included an allocation of $0 for the library. That move caught the attention of numerous library supporters who protested. Supervisors said they did so because they’d been requesting certain financial documents from the library for months but had not received them.
 Farmer responded by posting a link to Facebook with 27 different documents he had sent to the county.
 That post didn’t sit well with the library’s trustees, who all but one have been appointed by the board of supervisors in the last few months. Two of the six trustees who voted Thursday were attending their first meeting.
 At their June meeting, the trustees reprimanded Farmer and put him on a 30-day probationary period without pay and gave him a list of assignments to complete prior to Thursday’s meeting.
 A copy of the letter sent to Farmer by the trustees was obtained by the News & Messenger and in part chastised Farmer for his public Facebook post. The letter said, “The post was seen and commented on by many of the public and the County Board of Supervisors and Administrator were made to be seen in a very negative light. This is unacceptable and unprofessional and damages the relationship of the Library with the County leaders. The post and the comments have been retained for FOlA purposes but have been removed by demand of the Library Board.”
 The letter went on to direct Farmer to “refrain from making negative comments about any of the professional people he interacts with for Library purposes.”
 Among Farmer’s assignments was a letter to the trustees, in which he said he was “directed to apologize to the Board of Library Trustees for my three alleged transactions.”
 The first incident, according to the letter, was raising his voice to an employee for which Farmer said he had already done so multiple times in private and in public.” In an interview Friday, Farmer said, in a loud voice he asked an employee “In what world do you work?” and then immediately apologized so that everyone who heard the exchange also heard the apology.
 The second point was “failing to inform the Board… about a very minor collision between my personal vehicle and the Library van that involved only property.”
 The third issue Farmer called problematic.
 “Should I apologize for my Facebook post on June 15th, or for any resulting public comment arising from it, I would sacrifice my own honesty, because I have no regrets at all about the post. There is no job description for my position. Unless I have a specific directive from the Board of Trustees, I serve this library and its patrons through reliance upon my experience, education, training, professional literature, professional development, and professional relationships. When I have none of those to fall back on, I strive to operate as a reasonably prudent library director.”
 Noting his 20-year work experience as a librarian, Farmer continued, “I do not do anything in a vacuum. I have reasons for what I do, and I do not act rashly. I seek assistance when I need it. I trust the insights of others. I traffic in information. I rely on evidence. I view everything with a lens toward potential liability.

July 20 (Reuters) - Sheffield United's Europa League qualification hopes took a hammer blow after a second-half goal from Richarlison guided visitors Everton to a 1-0 win in their Premier League clash on Monday.
 After a cagey start at Bramall Lane, Everton created the best opportunity of the opening half with Dominic Calvert-Lewin's header smashing the post from close range.
 The visitors broke the deadlock straight after halftime when Gylfi Sigurdsson's free kick was headed in by Brazilian forward Richarlison for his 15th goal in all competitions this season.
 "The goal was down to Richarlison's movement and header. The way he guided it into the corner was top class," Sigurdsson said.
 David McGoldrick's immediate effort to equalise was blocked inside the box as the Blades rallied without managing to test Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford in the closing stages of the match.
 The result leaves United eighth in the table on 54 points from 37 games, two points behind seventh-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers, who host Crystal Palace later on Monday.
 To secure a place in the Europa League next season, United need three stars to align: They must win their final game of the season at Southampton; Wolves must lose both of their remaining games; and Chelsea must win the FA Cup to deny Arsenal a Europa League spot.
 Despite losing a second consecutive game, Blades boss Chris Wilder said his players have "ridiculously overachieved" in the club's first season back in the top flight since 2006-07.
 "We have overachieved and there are quite a lot of clubs that would want to swap places with us," he said.
 "I thought we deserved something from the game. We let ourselves down with the quality at the top end of the pitch."
 Meanwhile, Carlo Ancelotti's Everton are 11th in the standings after their first win in five league games.
 "The spirit was really good... the players know really well what our supporters ask for on the pitch - to have a good spirit and fight, and we showed that today," said Ancelotti.
 "We are at the end of the season but this fantastic spirit can be a good sign for the future." (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris and Hugh Lawson)

Adds Chicago measures, Florida deaths)
 By Daniel Trotta
 July 20 (Reuters) - The city of Chicago reimposed some coronavirus restrictions on Monday and the state of Florida reported more than 10,000 new cases for the sixth day in a row, as the pandemic showed few signs of abating in the United States.
 In a rare ray of hope, New York state reported the fewest hospitalizations from the coronavirus in four months and New York City entered a new phase of reopening on Monday, but the progress, in the very city and state that were once the epicenter, was eclipsed by the grim news nearly everywhere else.
 Metrics for the country have grown worse including a rising number of cases, deaths and hospitalizations along with rates of positive test results. The virus has killed 140,000 people in the United States and infected some 3.7 million, both figures leading the world.
 Florida reported 10,347 new cases on Monday, the sixth day in a row the state has announced over 10,000 new infections. Another 92 people died in Florida, increasing the state's death toll to 5,183.
 Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced new restrictions due to take effect on Friday including a ban on indoor service at bars and shutdown of personal services such as shaves and facials that require the removal of masks.
 "While we aren't near the peak of the pandemic from earlier this year, none of us wants to go back there," Lightfoot said in a statement.
 The city of Los Angeles is on the brink of issuing a new stay-at-home order and at least 14 states have reported record hospitalizations so far in July, including Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Texas.
 Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for schools to reopen in a few weeks and resisting a federal mandate that people wear masks in public, part of what New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called an "incompetent" federal government response.
 "I've said to the president from Day One: This virus does not respond to politics," Cuomo told a news conference. "The solution is medicine and science."
 WHITE HOUSE BRIEFINGS RESUME
 The country remained "totally unprepared," Cuomo said, as other states lagged in testing, contact tracing, and personal protective equipment for doctors and nurses.
 "Their mistake was they listened to the president," Cuomo said, while also blasting "stupid and reckless" people in his own state who persistently gather in large groups.
 On Monday Trump, under fire over his administration's response to the surging virus, said he would on Tuesday resume holding news briefings on the pandemic after a lengthy hiatus.
 White House debate has centered on whether Trump should risk doing daily briefings after he was mocked for musing that people might inject household disinfectants as a way to protect themselves from contracting the virus.
 Last Friday Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters she favored a return of the briefings, which she said had bolstered his approval ratings.
 New York state, where the virus took hold early this year before spreading to other states, recorded only eight deaths on Sunday while the total number of people hospitalized for the disease fell to 716, the fewest since March 18, Cuomo said.
 However a Reuters analysis of data from the COVID Tracking Project showed cases rose by more than 5,000 in the past week, the first week-over-week increase since April, breaking a 13-week streak of declines.
 New York City entered a new phase on Monday that will allow low-risk outdoor activity, entertainment at 33 percent capacity and professional sports events. But Major League Baseball's Yankees and Mets will start their seasons in empty New York City ballparks, indoor dining in restaurants is still prohibited, and bars are subject to social distancing rules.

Finally, I have gained a greater appreciation over the years of how important capital allocation is in general and how advantaged Tencent’s position is in particular. As the dominant social network in China, Tencent gets an early look at which start-ups (be it in games, services, or whatever) are gaining traction. Its ability to give investee companies a privileged position in Weixin makes it a preferred investor. By the same token, a privileged position in Weixin greatly improves the odds of the company becoming a commercial success. It is a flywheel that has proven spectacularly successful. Tencent owns substantial stakes in a long list of valuable businesses both inside and outside of China including Epic Games, SEA Ltd, JD.com, and Meituan. I estimate the value of the disclosed investments at over HK$ 900 bn (just under HK$ 100 per share), one fifth of Tencent’s market capitalisation.

Bloomberg) -- Judy Shelton, President Donald Trump’s controversial pick to join the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, heads for a vote before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday without the public support of a majority of the panel.
 Shelton, the former gold-standard advocate turned policy dove, and fellow nominee Christopher Waller, director of research at the St. Louis Fed, will finally receive their committee votes more than five months after appearing before the panel to answer questions. The committee will meet at 2 p.m. Washington time.
 Some Shelton critics have warned that Trump might elevate her to replace Jerome Powell when his term ends in 2022. That’s assuming the president wins re-election in November and is unhappy with his current Fed chair, whom he’s recently praised after years of harsh criticism for too-tight policy.
 Waller, a respected economist and Fed insider, is expected to win bipartisan support for his confirmation after Democrats during the February hearing voiced no strong objections to his appointment.
 While the scheduling of a vote is typically a sign that a nominee will clear the committee, Shelton hasn’t yet obtained enough support in public.
 Her unorthodox views on central banking and inconsistent stance on monetary policy have caused worries among a handful of Republicans. While Alabama’s Richard Shelby and Pennsylvania’s Patrick Toomey have signaled they will probably come around to support her, Louisiana’s John Kennedy has remained silent in public after voicing considerable concern over Shelton’s nomination.
 ‘Nutty Ideas’
 “Nobody wants anybody on the Federal Reserve that has a fatal attraction to nutty ideas,” he told reporters following the Feb. 13 hearing, though he insisted that didn’t necessarily apply to either of the nominees.
 Jess Andrews, a Kennedy spokesperson, declined to comment on the senator’s intention ahead of Tuesday’s vote.
 With Democrats expected to vote in unison against Shelton, just one Republican “no” on the committee would be enough to block her confirmation. If her nomination has enough support in committee, she must still face a vote from the full Senate for final approval, where four Republican defections would be enough to sink her chances, assuming Democrats are unified in their opposition.
 On at least one prior occasion, the Trump White House insisted on an up-or- down vote for a troubled nominee. In December 2017, Trump’s pick for the Export-Import Bank, Scott Garrett, was rejected by the Senate Banking Committee when two Republican senators joined Democrats in voting his nomination down.
 A White House official expressed confidence that Shelton would have enough support for her confirmation to proceed from the committee to the full Senate.
 Gold Standard
 Shelton holds a doctorate in business administration from the University of Utah and acted as an informal adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016. She has long favored policies aimed at eliminating even very low inflation and advocated a return to the gold standard, fixing the value of the U.S. dollar to a weight of gold, a system the U.S. followed to varying degrees until 1976.
 Those positions made her controversial to begin with, but since becoming a potential candidate for the Fed job in early 2019, she has reversed her views, even saying in June last year, well before the coronavirus pandemic, that she would seek to lower interest rates “as expeditiously as possible.” That prompted accusations she would simply do Trump’s bidding at the Fed.
 She has also questioned the efficacy of the so-called dual-mandate goals set for the Fed by Congress, to seek stable prices and maximum sustainable employment.
 ‘Nebulous Objectives’
 “I would probably be highly skeptical of those,” she said in an interview in May 2019. “Those are such nebulous objectives.”
 The prospect of Shelton as a governor is not especially alarming to many of her critics. Their biggest concern is that Trump, if re-elected, might make her Fed chair when Powell’s term expired in February 2022, though that would require a separate Senate confirmation process.
 Prior to the coronavirus crisis, Trump had criticized Powell repeatedly and threatened to remove or demote him. More recently, though, he has praised the Fed chief’s aggressive policy response to the pandemic.
 David Wilcox, former director of the Fed’s domestic research and forecasting unit, said even as an isolated governor, Shelton could damage the complexion of the Fed as a non-partisan institution. But the largest peril, he said, would come if she were to reach the chair.
 “The costs of having someone in the role of chair who clearly has instincts way outside the bounds of received wisdom, those costs could be just extraordinary for the U.S. and for the global economy,” he said.

Adds details, background)
 WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Top Democrats in the U.S. Congress called on Monday on the head of the FBI to brief lawmakers on foreign efforts to interfere in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, saying that Congress appeared to be the target of an interference effort.
 "We are gravely concerned, in particular, that Congress appears to be the target of a concerted foreign interference campaign, which seeks to launder and amplify disinformation in order to influence congressional activity, public debate, and the presidential election in November," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and the top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray.
 The nature of the disinformation campaign was not made clear. A congressional official said only that a classified addendum was sent alongside the letter that drew mainly from the U.S. government's own reporting.
 No Republican lawmakers signed on to the letter. The FBI did not immediately return a message seeking comment. (Reporting by Eric Beech; Writing by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Franklin Paul and Peter Cooney)
