 The duo picked up injury niggles during their side’s win over Wycombe, with Wallace having a tight hamstring prior to the match but able to complete the 90 minutes on Saturday.
 Bialkowski suffered a tight hamstring during the match and will be assessed ahead of the game against Luton but is expected to feature.
 The Lions will also assess the fitness of forwards Mason Bennett and Kenneth Zohore ahead of the game.
 Luton are waiting on news of James Collins’ condition.
 The striker missed his side’s 2-0 defeat to Stoke at the weekend because of a possible case of Covid-19 and is likely to also be absent midweek.

An Israeli man hospitalized with the coronavirus has been granted the rare chance to take part in his son's wedding after the Jerusalem hospital hosted the ceremony on its grounds, beneath the man's hospital room window.A video of Sunday's event by the Hadassah Medical Center showed the bride, escorted by two women holding candles, walking to a traditional wedding canopy set up on the hospital campus.As a live singer crooned Hebrew music, the couple, from an ultra-Orthodox family in the southern Israeli city of Arad, was surrounded by their guests, a handful of ultra-Orthodox men wearing masks, as well as several photographers.Looking on from a window above the ceremony was the groom's father, 56, who has been hospitalised in serious condition with COVID-19 since September, according to the hospital.In the video, he is seen with an oxygen mask on his face, lying in a hospital bed near the window, which was draped with colorful balloons.Yad Avraham, a medical volunteer organization that helped organize the wedding, said the father was dressed in a festive hat worn by ultra-Orthodox Jews on special occasions but was too weak to be dressed in full traditional wedding garb.The hospital said that Sunday's wedding was held in accordance with all Health Ministry guidelines.Hospitals around the world have looked for creative ways to circumvent the often heartbreaking challenges posed by the disease, which has divided grandchildren from grandparents, prevented final family visits to hospitals and drastically changed major life events.Israel this week relaxed restrictions following a monthlong lockdown meant to rein in a raging coronavirus outbreak. It has recorded more than 303,000 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, with more than 2,200 deaths and 272,000 recoveries.While daily infections have declined, restrictions are still in place, including on gatherings, which are limited to 20 people outdoors and 10 indoors.The small, muted ceremony stood in contrast to a number of large celebrations held by some segments of Israel's ultra-Orthodox community, who in some cases have defied rules on gatherings.

October 20, 1962, is embedded in collective Indian memory as a day of national humiliation when Beijing "surprised" Delhi and Chinese troops launched what the then defence minister, VK Krishna Menon, described as "an aggressive war" over disputed territory in the Ladakh region and NEFA areas (now Arunachal Pradesh). At one point in the brief eight-day war, it seemed as if Assam was being abandoned by a bewildered, panic-stricken Delhi and many inadequacies in India's higher defence management and military preparedness were laid bare.Fifty-eight years later, there is a correspondence of events, wherein India and China are currently engaged in a tense military stand-off along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Ladakh region and a large number of troops have been amassed by both nations. While 2020 is not 1962 and history may not quite repeat itself, some rhythms merit scrutiny for the strategically policy-relevant lessons of that war which Delhi has not learnt.The current ground situation in Ladakh is brittle, but there is guarded optimism that quiet diplomacy is underway and that a modus vivendi may still be arrived at, especially with India having gained a tactical advantage on the southern banks of Pangong Tso. However, in whichever manner this military build-up is resolved, there is an irreversible change in the nature of the India-China bilateral relationship after the Indian Army lost precious lives in a violent attack by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops in the Galwan Valley. In a recent conversation, external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, described the bilateral relationship as one that is now "profoundly disturbed".Could this exigency have been avoided or better managed? An objective review of the last 58 years would suggest that while Delhi was jolted out of the Jawaharlal Nehru-Krishna Menon make-believe framework that led to October 1962, the immediate response was tactical. The scapegoated army was re-organised at the senior level, and Prime Minister (PM) Nehru personally took over the defence portfolio for a brief period. But alas, the inadequacies in the higher defence management of the country were swept under the political carpet.This inability or reluctance to comprehend the fine print of strategic geography, the lessons of history, the abiding relevance of credible military capability and the correlation of these strands to national security have led to a series of "surprises" that peak with an all too familiar post-crisis Delhi fumble. This was evident in October 1962 (Nehru), Kargil 1999 (AB Vajpayee), Mumbai 2008 (Manmohan Singh) and now Galwan 2020 (Narendra Modi).In relation to China, a fundamental policy flaw over the last six decades-plus has been the make-believe frame of reference that the Indian political apex has chosen to inhabit. In 1962, the Nehru-Menon perception of the China issue was the assiduous creation of a simulacrum -- where the imagined reality becomes "the reality" for its adherents. Nehru's conviction about post- colonial Asian solidarity and Menon's theological faith in the virtues of communism created a virtual "China issue" for a fledgling India. The received wisdom was that China, with Mao at the helm, could be managed by high politics and eloquent diplomacy at the United Nations.The hard and unpalatable reality of the rubber hitting the road was visible in the ill-equipped, poorly-clad Indian soldier having to defend national sovereignty to the last man -- as the Battle of Rezang La demonstrated. A huge political blunder and a grossly inadequate higher defence management were at the heart of the debacle, but it is moot if the right strategic lessons have been learnt by Raisina Hill.After the historic Rajiv Gandhi visit to China in 1988, the post-Cold War period saw India and China engaging more robustly at the bilateral level and the PV Narasimha Rao to Manmohan Singh trajectory (1991-2014) was one of stabilising the relationship and enhancing the trade-economic engagement. The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and the foreign office were the lead players in shaping and implementing India's China policy -- from agreements about the LAC to the Dalai Lama, Taiwan and more. An element of wishful thinking permeated this China policy, which believed that a visible demonstration of Indian good faith to the one-China policy and respect for China's core sensitivities would allow the LAC to recede into the background. As part of this "appeasement", Delhi lived with the anomaly of Beijing supporting Pakistan in relation to terrorism and undermining India in international fora.On the Modi watch, the China issue morphed into a problem over the Chumar intrusion (September 2014) and festered through the Depsang-Doklam-Galwan continuum. In retrospect, it is not evident that Nehru's policy errors were rigorously internalised by the current dispensation. Hence, comprehensive national security capability in relation to China was a low priority and the political oxygen was focused on Pakistan with its domestic electoral subtext. The mistaken assumption (the new simulacrum?) appears to have been that high-level summit meetings and frequent bilateral meetings between PM Modi and President Xi Jinping would help resolve the very complex territorial dispute summarised as the three-letter LAC.The reality of China's intent in relation to India has tested the perspicacity of India's higher defence gene-pool to make an objective and effective assessment of the Xi gameplan and arrive at policy options that are viable and sustainable in the long-run.A post Covid-19 world is struggling to emerge and it may be prudent for the Modi government to do a Vajpayee a la Kargil and go back to the drawing board. The central objective would be to objectively comprehend the nature of the China challenge for India from October 1962 to 2020, beyond just the LAC impasse.C Uday Bhaskar is director, Society for Policy Studies, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal

The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah on Monday said he is not worried after the Enforcement Directorate questioned him in connection with a money laundering investigation linked to J-K Cricket Association scam. The National Conference chief said the questioning is nothing new. "This questioning has been going on for many years, it is nothing new. I am not going to say anything. The Court will decide what is to be done. I am not worried," the leader said after leaving the ED's office, as quoted by ANI.Abdullah said the political battle will continue whether he is alive or dead. "We have a long way to go, a long political battle that will continue whether Farooq Abdullah is alive or dead, on the stage or not on the stage. Our fight is for restoration of Article 370 & our resolve will never change even if I've to be hanged," he added.The leader was quizzed on Monday at the agency's regional office at Srinagar's Raj Bagh in the probe connected to a money laundering scam of over Rs 40 crore of JKCA funds. The officials said the NC chief's statement will be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), according to PTI.Abdullah received the summons by the ED on October 16, a day after the People's Alliance was announced in the Gupkar declaration. Several leaders from different political parties from Jammu and Kashmir of the newly formed alliance called the ED's summons issued to Abdullah a "witch hunt". The National Conference termed it as "political vendetta" by the Centre."The BJP, after failing to politically fight party president Farooq Abdullah, has resorted to employing its agencies for the task," a party spokesperson said on Monday in a statement.

India is neglecting bank recapitalisation as it focuses on debt moratoriums and interest waivers for borrowers amid the Covid-19 pandemic, a former central bank official told Reuters on Monday.Indian banks are saddled with over $120 billion in bad debt, and in severely stressed conditions the bad-loan ratio could nearly double by March, according to Reserve Bank of India projections.Restoring banks' capital is critical for aiding a meaningful recovery, but there has been little focus on the matter, former RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya said."This lack of focus is tantamount to kicking the can down the road and jettisoning financial stability for short-term gains," said Acharya, who recently wrote a book titled the "Quest for Restoring Financial Stability in India"."This repeated mistake has prevented India from recovering well from adverse shocks," Acharya said. His comments came weeks after India offered to waive the compounded interest component on all loans up to 20 million rupees following a legal challenge to the terms of a six-month moratorium. Designing moratoria and forgiveness like farm-loan waivers that favour borrowers excessively in the short term has been detrimental to a sound recovery of credit growth in the medium term, Acharya said.Though the latest one-time restructuring package has been fine-tuned to ensure it cannot be misused, it still has a little bit of a "band-aid and short-termism" approach to it, he said.Funds to provide for the losses that would be incurred through restructuring should be set aside so that banks do not strangle growth as the economy begins to recover after the pandemic."If the government doesn't wish to recapitalise banks in a timely manner, then it must ensure that the contours of debt moratoria and forgiveness package aren't so generous that banks won't be in a position to lend well during the recovery phase, which is likely around the corner," Acharya said.It would be good to learn from the past mistakes and start the work of repairing bank balance sheets at the same time as giving a soft landing to bank borrowers and the real economy.

I may not be quoting Professor Stephen Chan verbatim. But in a nutshell, this is what I got from a sober, academic, and carefully thought through interview.

The presence of the security sector: “the militarized impression” in the mainstream politics removes Mnangagwa as a serious leader of a modern country, whose Finance minister assumes as modern based economy, for this reason he is dismally failing to uplift it as was the case in other Asian countries who were once in a similar economic situation as Zimbabwe yesterday and today.

As Vice Chairman of the Lake Chad Basin Scientific Committee , Mr Freeman was the key speaker at the historic Abuja Conference in 2018. He is well known in Nigeria, Sudan, Ghana and several other African countries where he has, for years, been laying out a roadmap for Africa`s economic transformation based on Alexander Hamilton`s credit system.

Yet even if the president makes Battle Force 2045 a priority, change on this scale will not be easy. The Pentagon — and the White House, where National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien has made growing the Navy a personal priority — cannot count on Congress to simply fall in line. Naval advocates in the executive branch need to sell a simple vision of integrated American seapower to the legislative branch in order to get budgetary buy-in. This will require the Pentagon to step out of its comfort zone.

The California native competed in her first Truck Series start Saturday afternoon, driving in the No. 17 DGR-Crosley Ford F-150 and coming home to a 16th place finish, one lap down. During the race, Ford Performance had announced that their developmental driver, Deegan, will be going full-time in the Truck Series next year starting at Daytona. Deegan just wrapped up her first full season in the ARCA Menards Series, earning four top fives and 17 Top 10 finishes while finishing third in points. However, the Truck Series could present a learning curve for Deegan in her first season. Only time will tell how well she adjusts.

Peters made his first start since Talladega last year driving for Joe Nemechek's team. The Providence, North Carolina native finished a respectable seventh place after starting 28th. Peters seems to be making one-off and part-time efforts over the last couple of years, but if a competitive ride were to open up for him, it seems likely that a team owner would want Peters as part of their organization. Peters has 11 Truck Series wins to his credit and was a runner-up for the championship in 2012 driving for the now-defunct Red Horse Racing team.

Chinese diplomats injured one of their Taiwanese counterparts during a scuffle in the South Pacific earlier this month, a senior Taiwanese official said, highlighting rising concerns over Beijing's aggressive "wolf warrior" diplomacy.
 Two uninvited diplomats from the Chinese embassy in Fiji were asked to leave an event celebrating Taiwan's national day in Suva on Oct. 8 after they were seen photographing other guests, Taiwan's Deputy Foreign Minister Harry Tseng told lawmakers in Taipei on Monday.
 When confronted by Taiwanese officials, the Chinese diplomats initiated a physical confrontation, leaving one staff member from the Taiwanese representative office in Fiji needing hospital treatment for a head injury, Tseng said.
 Taiwan's Foreign Ministry condemned what it called "provocative wolf warrior diplomacy" as a violation of rule of law and civilized behavior, a reference to Chinese diplomats who have taken an increasingly assertive stance on social media in advocating for Beijing's policies. A ministry spokesperson told Bloomberg News by text that the injury was a "mild concussion."
   
   
 "We strongly condemn the violence against our diplomat in Fiji by China's uncivilized 'wolf warriors,'" Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Twitter. "Taiwan is a force for good in the world & we won't be intimidated.
 Diplomatic Fight
 China Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Monday that the allegations had "no facts" and that Taiwan was "playing victim here."
 "Any attempt to sow discord between China and Pacific Island countries using the Taiwan issue will not succeed," he told a daily briefing in Beijing.
 The Chinese embassy in Fiji said in an earlier statement that a Chinese diplomat had been injured when staffers from the Taipei Trade Office in Fiji "acted provocatively," and asked local police to investigate.
 Taiwan's Foreign Ministry objected to China's "untrue statement" about the incident, saying it was an attempt to "muddy the issue."
 "We can't let China bully its way into doing whatever it wants," Taiwanese lawmaker Wang Ting-yu tweeted. "Our diplomats in Fiji have my full support."
 Diplomatic Battleground
 The incident in Fiji is particularly sensitive as the Pacific is one of the major battlegrounds for diplomatic influence between Beijing and Taipei. After the Solomon Islands and Kiribati switched ties to China in quick succession in 2019, the U.S. stepped in to shore up support for Taiwan in the region, urging Taipei's last four remaining allies not to follow suit.
 While governments around the world are becoming increasingly concerned about China's more strident approach to diplomacy, Taiwan has long been on the receiving end of it. China's Communist Party -- which claims the democratic island as part of its territory despite never having ruled it -- has steadily increased its diplomatic and military pressure on Taipei.
 Aircraft from China's People's Liberation Army repeatedly encroached into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone in recent months, twice crossing the median line of the Taiwan Strait -- which for decades stood as a tacit border between the two sides. China has also steadily whittled away formal recognition of Taiwan in the international arena, leaving Taipei with just 15 official allies.

The Welsh decision came as officials in Greater Manchester continue to reject efforts by Johnson’s Conservative government to move the region into the highest level of restrictions in the three-tier system Johnson unveiled for England a week ago. While the government’s scientific advisers have recommended a short national lockdown, Johnson says his tiered, regional approach limits the economic and social damage from the pandemic on areas where infection rates are lower.
 Johnson’s government says the talks with authorities in Manchester must be completed Monday because the public health situation is deteriorating, but local officials are holding out for more financial assistance for those hurt by the restrictions.
 Sean Fielding, a council leader in the Manchester area, told the BBC that local leaders are trying to protect residents from the government’s “untested” strategy. Fielding said he favors a short national lockdown instead.
 “The logical solution, to me, seems to be to take the advice of your national scientific advisers, do the short-term circuit-breaker lockdown, which will be much less painful because it will be for a shorter period,” he said. “It will be cheaper in the long run as well, because you will only have to provide that financial support for those few weeks whereas this could run on and on and on beyond Christmas.”

For our experiment, we posed as citizens of different genders and emailed a request for help to a total of 3,685 national legislators in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Uruguay. In Europe, we asked for assistance signing up for unemployment benefits. In Latin America, we requested help getting medical care without health insurance. The response rate ranged widely, from 6% in Mexico – where government accountability to citizens is a documented problem – to 89% in Ireland, where the small district size likely increases legislators’ accountability. In all European and most Latin American countries, women politicians were more likely to answer our request than male politicians. Female legislators replied 28% of the time, compared with 23% of male legislators. The gender responsiveness gap was bigger in certain countries – up to 13 percentage points in Colombia. Furthermore, women seeking help receive significantly more responses than men – 26% versus 23% of the time. In Europe, female legislators in particular were more likely to reply to our queries when we posed as women – 44% versus 36%. In Latin...

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s government says it has finalized plans to extend a wall along its northeast border with Turkey, over concerns that migrants may try to stage mass crossings into the European Union country. A government spokesman said Monday that 16 miles of wall would be added to an existing six-mile barrier in a $74 million project due to be completed by the end of April. A standoff occurred at the border earlier this year after Turkey said it would no longer prevent migrants trying to reach the EU, and tens of thousands tried to cross into Greece.

According to Maxwell, the wave of letters of intent has dwindled since the county announced different options students could opt into this year, from distance learning to blended learning. Maxwell also said Marion County's number of homeschool requests was lower than that of other counties, due to offering multiple learning models.
 "We have several options that have helped keep our numbers down," Maxwell said. "I think we're doing a pretty good job with maintaining those numbers or keeping them smaller because of the options we have provided for families."
 Parents always have the option to homeschool their kids at any time during the school year, but Maxwell said she believes many believed it would be a viable change this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, she said the option provides its own set of challenges, because it completely separates a student from the public school system.
 "The biggest difference that separates homeschool from all the other options, is homeschool, you are signing out of public education," Maxwell said. "You are un-enrolling from public ed, and as a parent or guardian, you are taking on the responsibility of your child's education. That's the biggest difference."
 Despite this high number of letters of intent to homeschool, Maxwell said many parents have since re-enrolled their children back into the Marion County Schools system, because of the option for distance learning.
 "We have several that have gone back into the blended learning or distance learning option once they realized what the plans were going to be," Maxwell said. "I had some families that submitted early on in the summer not knowing what the options were going to be, then they contacted me later."
 Another learning option offered throughout the state is West Virginia Virtual School, which saw a spike in Marion County this year, potentially because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Sherry Copley, curriculum coordinator for Marion County Schools, handles West Virginia Virtual School in the county, and said many parents had tried to sign their kids up for the program in light of the uncertainty of the school year.
 "We have less than 40 right now," Copley said. "We had about 300 sign up initially, and once they found out that Marion County was offering the distance option, most of them wanted one of our local teachers and they switched to that."

According to Dr. Mensah, such an aim is unattainable.      Speaking on Campus Exclusive on the back of the global commemoration of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, the lecturer described the goal as a mirage.      “I think that statement itself is a mirage. There is no way poverty can be eradicated in the world as far as humanity is concerned. We can reduce its perception, and the perception has to do with being able to provide basic necessities for society. As we talk about health, good roads, portable drinking water, being able to create employable skills for the people, and being able to develop potentials. Even providing power and energy. All contribute towards reducing poverty,” he said      Dr. Mensah added that the mindset of people considered to be poor, which the government has no control over, is one of the problems causing them to be in such a situation.      “As to somebody that has been classified as poor itself has nothing to do with the government, it has to do with the mindset. One major problem that we have has to do with our societal setting and how we have placed value on material things more than things that are ethical as Ghanaians”.

 It seemed an oddly angry and defensive response for someone who insists he has nothing to hide.
 Like I said at the start of this column, I don't know if the Post story is true.
 But I do know there has been no denial that the emails are genuine, and they raise legitimate questions of probity and honesty that anyone who wants to be President should answer.
 The longer Biden doesn't answer them properly, the more people will think there may a fire raging beneath all the smoke.
 US mainstream and social media companies have reacted to this story in an outrageously partisan and deeply sinister manner that is diametrically opposed to how they would have reacted if the name 'Biden' was swapped for 'Trump.'
 Shame on all of them.
 And when Trump, as he surely will, starts beating Biden over the head with the allegations in the final debate on Thursday, will the NBC moderator hold the former Vice President to an answer or will she let him off the hook?
 Because so far the way Joe Biden's reacted to it smacks of someone with something to hide.
 And this issue is not going to just disappear if he wins the presidency.
 The Republicans will use it as a stick to constantly beat him with just as they used Whitewater against the Clintons, and just as the Democrats themselves used alleged Russian collusion against Trump.
 Sooner or later, the truth will out.

India is neglecting bank recapitalisation as it focuses on debt moratoriums and interest waivers for borrowers amid the Covid-19 pandemic, a former central bank official told Reuters on Monday.
 Indian banks are saddled with over $120 billion in bad debt, and in severely stressed conditions the bad-loan ratio could nearly double by March, according to Reserve Bank of India projections.
 Restoring banks' capital is critical for aiding a meaningful recovery, but there has been little focus on the matter, former RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya said.
 "This lack of focus is tantamount to kicking the can down the road and jettisoning financial stability for short-term gains," said Acharya, who recently wrote a book titled the "Quest for Restoring Financial Stability in India".
   
   
 "This repeated mistake has prevented India from recovering well from adverse shocks," Acharya said. His comments came weeks after India offered to waive the compounded interest component on all loans up to 20 million rupees following a legal challenge to the terms of a six-month moratorium.
 Designing moratoria and forgiveness like farm-loan waivers that favour borrowers excessively in the short term has been detrimental to a sound recovery of credit growth in the medium term, Acharya said.
 Though the latest one-time restructuring package has been fine-tuned to ensure it cannot be misused, it still has a little bit of a "band-aid and short- termism" approach to it, he said.
 Funds to provide for the losses that would be incurred through restructuring should be set aside so that banks do not strangle growth as the economy begins to recover after the pandemic.
 "If the government doesn't wish to recapitalise banks in a timely manner, then it must ensure that the contours of debt moratoria and forgiveness package aren't so generous that banks won't be in a position to lend well during the recovery phase, which is likely around the corner," Acharya said.
 It would be good to learn from the past mistakes and start the work of repairing bank balance sheets at the same time as giving a soft landing to bank borrowers and the real economy.

Bruck and Huang explain that persistent practice (convergent) primarily reinforces “cognitive pathways.” But the downside to repetition is that it “gives you a less flexible brain.” So I learned the answer, aced the test, and now you want me to put that in a drawer and just whip up some “non-linear” spontaneity.
 In the area of unique ideas, it is divergent thinking that appears to do better. It works on “remote associations” — what you might call free-wheeling connections. In sports you can see this easily, as participants find spontaneous solutions on the fly. By contrast the convergent brain’s job is to connect a new concept and put it into a coherent context (e.g. a quarterback v. a coach).
 The problem set for the research was focused on a “name generating exercise.” How do you think up the name “Uber” or “Frappuccino” versus the name “Peas in a Pod?” I know that most of us do not work at an advertising agency thinking up new product names, but the problem of creativity is relevant to all of us. Are we more creative in the morning or at night? The 507 subjects in the test did much better in the morning. Around 11 p.m., they produced the worst results. And they noted that “thinking late in the afternoon” leads to more habitual (not very creative) thinking. That is around the time, I creatively mix a martini, so I might take exception with that one.
 They argue that you need to prevent your team from “rehearsing the same thing over and over again.” One of the ways that an entrepreneur can overcome this is by occasionally “throwing the baby out with the bathwater” and then refilling the tub. I see in my advisory work that teams can get stuck. They know what they know, and they keep trying to ram the square peg into the round hole, to prove their thesis, or they take sandpaper and try to modify the shape – rather than perhaps finding both a different peg and a different hole.

An Israeli man hospitalized with the coronavirus has been granted the rare chance to take part in his son's wedding after the Jerusalem hospital hosted the ceremony on its grounds, beneath the man's hospital room window.
 A video of Sunday's event by the Hadassah Medical Center showed the bride, escorted by two women holding candles, walking to a traditional wedding canopy set up on the hospital campus.
 As a live singer crooned Hebrew music, the couple, from an ultra-Orthodox family in the southern Israeli city of Arad, was surrounded by their guests, a handful of ultra-Orthodox men wearing masks, as well as several photographers.
 Looking on from a window above the ceremony was the groom's father, 56, who has been hospitalised in serious condition with COVID-19 since September, according to the hospital.
   
   
 In the video, he is seen with an oxygen mask on his face, lying in a hospital bed near the window, which was draped with colorful balloons.
 Yad Avraham, a medical volunteer organization that helped organize the wedding, said the father was dressed in a festive hat worn by ultra-Orthodox Jews on special occasions but was too weak to be dressed in full traditional wedding garb.
 The hospital said that Sunday's wedding was held in accordance with all Health Ministry guidelines.
 Hospitals around the world have looked for creative ways to circumvent the often heartbreaking challenges posed by the disease, which has divided grandchildren from grandparents, prevented final family visits to hospitals and drastically changed major life events.
 Israel this week relaxed restrictions following a monthlong lockdown meant to rein in a raging coronavirus outbreak. It has recorded more than 303,000 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, with more than 2,200 deaths and 272,000 recoveries.
 While daily infections have declined, restrictions are still in place, including on gatherings, which are limited to 20 people outdoors and 10 indoors.
 The small, muted ceremony stood in contrast to a number of large celebrations held by some segments of Israel's ultra-Orthodox community, who in some cases have defied rules on gatherings. (AP) CPS

There is a school of thought that this season represents the best chance in a long time for a surprise winner in some of Europe's biggest leagues, given the disruption caused to the calendar by the coronavirus pandemic.
 Coming into this season, Juventus had won nine titles in a row in Italy, Bayern Munich had won eight on the bounce in Germany and Paris Saint-Germain had won seven of the last eight Ligue 1 crowns, while it takes an exceptional year for neither Barcelona nor Real Madrid to win La Liga.
 However, more than halfway through October, Everton lead the Premier League, Real Sociedad sit top in Spain, RB Leipzig lead the way in Germany, AC Milan are first in Serie A and Lille top Ligue 1.
 Maybe a wind of change is sweeping through European football? It is possible, although there is still ample time for the superclubs to reclaim the positions they feel are rightfully theirs.

Envisioned additions to the attack submarine force perhaps attracted the most attention. This plan sees the force growing from 51 today to between 70 and 80 by 2045. As Esper put it during his remarks, “If we do nothing else, we must begin building three Virginia-class attack submarines per year.” This commitment is critical, especially because under current plans the Navy would shrink down to 44 attack submarines over the next five years and the administration’s Fiscal Year 2021 budget request only called for one attack submarine this year. In light of Esper’s new goal of three per year, seapower advocates should redouble their efforts to support the two Virginia-class submarines authorized in the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act instead of the single submarine in the Senate’s version.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Personnel stationed at a military base in Alaska's largest city were ordered to avoid bars and interior dining at restaurants amid rising coronavirus cases on and off the base. Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson placed the restrictions on airmen and soldiers in Anchorage, The Anchorage Daily News reported Saturday. Members of the 673rd Air Base Wing are not allowed to visit businesses that “primarily engage in preparing and serving alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption,” an Oct. 8 memo from base Commander Col. Kirsten Aguilar said. The order keeps active- duty airmen assigned to the 673rd Wing from visiting bars, breweries, pubs and nightclubs. The restrictions were enacted as a “precaution” because of increasing COVID-19 cases statewide, Media Operations Section Chief Erin Eaton said. \"The decision was made based on data and inputs from the medical team through their contact tracing efforts, and through base leadership’s evaluation of risk,” Eaton said in an email. The regulation may be reviewed within 30 days. Aguilar said in a video posted on social media Friday that the base has moved into HPCON Charlie, a military health protection level requiring additional limitations on certain base services and potentially more telecommuting. “Over the last seven to 10 days we’ve seen significant increases on base, mirroring what we’re seeing in Anchorage and across Alaska,” Aguilar said in the video. More people may be asked to work remotely because of virus transmission among people in workplace settings, Aguilar said. The base's Government Hill gate was closed temporarily beginning Saturday. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks....

Ideally, we would fund shipbuilding increases with a higher defense topline driven by strategic demands. Yet Esper was right to acknowledge that we live in a “cost-constrained” environment. Particularly in light of emergency spending throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the chances of a large defense plus-up are slim to none, regardless of who wins in November — a point that John Kroger makes in a thoughtful critique of Esper’s plan. Kroger argues that Esper should have oriented his review around the best fleet the Navy could buy under a flat budget, and not the best fleet the Navy could buy, period. Yet this is defeatism, plain and simple.

The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah on Monday said he is not worried after the Enforcement Directorate questioned him in connection with a money laundering investigation linked to J-K Cricket Association scam.
 The National Conference chief said the questioning is nothing new. "This questioning has been going on for many years, it is nothing new. I am not going to say anything. The Court will decide what is to be done. I am not worried," the leader said after leaving the ED's office, as quoted by ANI.
 Abdullah said the political battle will continue whether he is alive or dead. "We have a long way to go, a long political battle that will continue whether Farooq Abdullah is alive or dead, on the stage or not on the stage. Our fight is for restoration of Article 370 & our resolve will never change even if I've to be hanged," he added.
 The leader was quizzed on Monday at the agency's regional office at Srinagar's Raj Bagh in the probe connected to a money laundering scam of over Rs 40 crore of JKCA funds. The officials said the NC chief's statement will be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), according to PTI.
 Abdullah received the summons by the ED on October 16, a day after the People's Alliance was announced in the Gupkar declaration. Several leaders from different political parties from Jammu and Kashmir of the newly formed alliance called the ED's summons issued to Abdullah a "witch hunt".
 The National Conference termed it as "political vendetta" by the Centre."The BJP, after failing to politically fight party president Farooq Abdullah, has resorted to employing its agencies for the task," a party spokesperson said on Monday in a statement.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s government says it has finalized plans to extend a wall along its northeast border with Turkey, over concerns that migrants may try to stage mass crossings into the European Union country. Government spokesman Stelios Petsas said Monday that 26 kilometers (16 miles) of wall would be added to an existing 10-kilometer (six-mile) section in a 63-million-euro ($74 million) project due to be completed by the end of April. A standoff occurred at the border earlier this year after Turkey said it would no longer prevent migrants trying to reach the EU, and tens of thousands tried to cross into Greece. The two countries are also at odds over energy rights in the eastern Mediterranean in a dispute that has triggered a dangerous military buildup in the region and fears of conflict. Four Greek construction companies have been selected to build the new wall and upgrade the existing section of fencing, running along or close to the Evros River, which forms much of the border between the two countries. The wall will be made using galvanized square steel tubes and concrete foundations, according to Greece’s public order ministry. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visited the border region on Saturday after a test installation of a section of the new wall. The number of migrants and refugees traveling from Turkey to Greece fell sharply this year during the pandemic and after the border standoff prompted tougher border policing. Turkey has accused Greece of illegally pushing back migrants reaching its islands in the eastern Aegean Sea, a charge that Athens denies. Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees worldwide, at nearly 4 million people, mostly from Syria, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency.

A WOMAN has told a court she has no memory of driving while drunk and crashing her car twice, or of threatening to kill a police officer, after her drink was spiked.
 Sophia Morgan, 23, faced Maclean Local Court on Thursday after pleading guilty to driving with mid-range PCA and intimidating a police officer in execution of their duty.
 The court heard that on the evening of June 2 this year Morgan went to the Pacific Hotel in Yamba with a friend and had two drinks before leaving.
 Court documents reveal Morgan was captured on CCTV footage leaving with a six pack of beer, then driving away.
 About 11pm that night witnesses and CCTV footage recorded Morgan driving from a Yamba address along Clarence St where she side swiped another vehicle, before driving away at excessive speeds.
 The court heard Morgan then crossed onto the wrong side of the road, mounted a median strip then drove over the top of a roundabout before coming to a stop on the side of the road.
 Morgan was helped from the vehicle and police were called, and Morgan recorded a positive roadside breath test of 0.187. She was then taken to Yamba Police Station where a second analysis returned a reading 0f 0.117.
 The court heard Morgan was taken by police to her mother’s address, but were called back shortly after when Morgan entered a psychotic state, and made very serious threats against police who responded to the call, who with the assistance of NSW Ambulance paramedics sedated her and transported her to Lismore Base Hospital.
 Morgan’s solicitor Mark Spagnolo told the court his client has no recollection of anything beyond her leaving the Pacific Hotel that night, and the only clue is from a text message on her phone that stated she didn’t feel safe at her friend’s address.
 Mr Spagnolo told the court that while there was no toxicology report done on his client, he submitted that she believed her drink was spiked and that “clearly something happened to her”.
 He also submitted that his client had struggled with serious mental health issues in the past as a result of a number of traumatic experiences in her youth.
 Magistrate Kathy Crittenden accepted that Morgan’s significant mental health issues had a role to play in her offending, but said she had made a deliberate choice to drink and drive, with the fact that she was on a provisional licence at the time an aggravating factor.
 “Your driving was an extremely alarming course of conduct, and if anyone had been in your path God knows what charges you would be facing,” Ms Crittenden said.
 The magistrate said that while she found there to be a “strong causal link” between Morgan’s mental health and the intimidation offence, she also said that it was a very serious threat on an officer that deserved respect.
 Morgan was convicted and sentenced to a conditional release order for 18 months, and disqualified from driving for six months.
