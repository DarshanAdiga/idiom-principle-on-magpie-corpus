"It was in the back of my mind [that I might have Covid-19] because as a reporter, we're dealing with all this stuff front and center and most of my time is spent on Capitol Hill—we all know that's a germy place. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions. So I went into the doctor's office, I put on a mask, and the doctor at that point said _well, you know, we gave you a flu test and it 's negative, but you don't have a cough, so it's probably something else_. [But] once I developed a cough, then they were like _okay, you 're getting a little bit worse_. That's when my doctor finally recommended me to get a Covid test.

The story structure of “Selah and the Spades” is far from rigorous, floating on our own genre-based expectations, while shooting for something atmospheric, evocative and symbolic. It’s arresting to behold, but it almost seems to run out of steam at a certain point. But for any of its story flaws, “Selah and the Spades” is so tonally and aesthetically indelible, it announces the arrival of an exciting new cinematic voice in Poe, and cements Lovie Simone as a bona fide movie star.

Of course, it has not been a straight line up for the yellow metal. In fact, gold prices sold off very hard with close to 5 million futures trading volume during the March 9th to March 19th window (Chart 3) on the back of a major liquidity crunch. The move was not unique to the gold market, with fixed income assets also experiencing a big spike in volatility around that time (Chart 4). The pre-March 19 peak to trough decline for gold was 12% compared to an 8% drop in the US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) ETF or a 22% decline in investment grade ETF values such as LQD.

While the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus has caused the postponement or outright cancellation of countless local events, SCARC officials were determined not to let the annual Gordon Shelton Memorial Walk-a-thon suffer the same fate.
   
 "We are happy to say the event is not canceled...we're just doing it differently," read a statement on the walk's website.
   
 Rather than its usual home at the Sussex County Fairgrounds, the 18th annual event will be held virtually on Sunday, May 17. On that date, participants are invited to hop on the treadmill or head outside to the streets or nearby trails to benefit SCARC, a non-profit organization that serves children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
   
 Festivities will get underway at noon with a Facebook Live video on SCARC's page, during which the public will be asked to post photos and short videos of their walks to be added to the organization's social media post. Unlike in years past, when attendees would all walk the same route around the fairgrounds property, there is no minimum or maximum distance participants will be asked to walk.
   
 "We're just asking them to do whatever they're capable of doing," said Chris Hemmer, chief development officer for the SCARC Foundation. "It's just a fun way to kind of build the virtual community since we can't all be together."
   
 Adding to the fun, SCARC will award prizes for best virtual team photo, most creative sign, best motivational photo and most scenic walk route. The winners of each category will be announced the day after the walk.
   
 The annual walk-a-thon raises money for various recreation programs, respite care and guardianship services for individuals and families associated with SCARC. This year, additional funds will help cover expenses for face masks, hand sanitizer and other products purchased to help slow the spread of coronavirus.
   
 Hemmer said he is hoping the virtual walk-a-thon will at least come close to the support it has received each of the last two years, when roughly 650 people took part and helped raise between $120,000 and $135,000 for SCARC programs. As of Monday afternoon, donations for this year's event had exceeded $81,500, good for 60% of the $135,000 goal.
   
 "I'm not exactly sure what to expect as far as fundraising," Hemmer said. "We've got a lot of loyal supporters, but to put a ballpark number, I'm not sure."
   
 Regardless of the final total, Hemmer and the rest of the SCARC team are excited to foster an element of fun in the Sussex County area during an uncertain time.
   
 "What I'm looking forward to is just seeing some smiling faces, even if it is virtual, on May 17," Hemmer said.

TOKIO (AP) -- Los organizadores de los Juegos Olimpicos de Tokio y el COI discrepan abiertamente sobre quien debe asumir el costo adicional que acarrea el aplazamiento sin precedente de la justa deportiva.
 El conflicto quedo a flor de piel el martes, cuando el portavoz de Tokio Masa Takaya dijo que el comite organizador pidio al Comite Olimpico Internacional que removiera una frase de su pagina web en el que se indica que el primer ministro japones Shinzo Abe acepto que Japon ib a cargar la mayor parte de los gastos por la demora de un año.
 Segun medios de prensa japonesa, el atraso causado por la pandemia de coronavirus provocara un gasto extra que oscila entre los 2.000 y 6.000 millones de dolares. Ninguna de las partes ha brindado un estimado oficial, pero el director ejecutivo de Tokio Toshiro Muto ha descrito como "monumental" el costo de la posposicion.
 "No es apropiado mencionar el nombre del primer ministro de esta manera", dijo Takaya en una teleconferencia de 90 minutos de duracion.
 Casi todas las preguntas giraron en torno a una publicacion del COI, con sede en Suiza, sobre el costo que Japon tendra que asumir por el retraso.
 La declaracion del COI, incorporada en una seccion titulada "Preguntas Frecuentes sobre los Juegos Olimpicos Tokio 2020", decia que Abe acepto que Japon "continuara cubriendo los costos asumidos bajos los terminos del acuerdo existente para 2020, y que el COI seguira siendo responsable por su parte de los costos".
 Despues de la queja de la capital japonesa, el COI elimino el nombre de Abe y toda referencia a la obligacion financiera de Japon. La version editada reza: "El gobierno de Japon ha reiterado que sigue firme en su disposicion de cumplir con su responsabilidad de organizar un exitosos Juegos".
 Sin usar el nombre de Abe, el presidente del COI Thomas Bach dijo casi exactamente lo mismo hace 10 dias en una entrevista con el diario aleman Die Welt. Bach señalo que Japon "continuara cubriendo los gastos que le tocan" bajo el acuerdo firmado en 2013.
 El portavoz de Abe, Yoshihide Suga, tambien salio al cruce del COI y señalo el martes que "no hay tal acuerdo relacionado con el costo adicional por la posposicion".
 Pese al conflicto, no hay mucho debate sobre quien tendra que cargar con el mayor peso. Son los japoneses. Pero es un tema sensible, sobre todo para Abe durante un desplome de la economia debido a la pandemia.
 El presupuesto oficial de los Juegos asciende a 12.600 millones de dolares, aunque una auditoria del gobierno indico en diciembre que el costo real era de 28.000 millones. Todo salvo 5.600 millones de dolares es dinero de los contribuyentes.
 Bajo los terminos del Contrato de Ciudad Anfitriona que se firmo en 2013 cuando Tokio obtuvo la sede, la ciudad de Tokio, el gobierno de Japon, el Comite Olimpico de Japon y los organizadores locales estan obligados a cubrir la mayor parte de los gastos por la competicion.
 John Coates, un australiano que es miembro del COI y a cargo de la mision de inspectores de Tokio, dijo en una teleconferencia con los organizadores que la posposicion le iba a costar al COI "varios cientos de millones de dolares". Bach dijo lo mismo al diario aleman.
 Coates fue claro al señalar que los pagos del COI seran destinados para rescatar las finanzas de los comites olimpicos nacionales y las federaciones nacionales, no la organizacion en Tokio.
 Una de las soluciones planteadas por Coates fue colaborar con Tokio para eliminar gastos superfluos.
 Takaya tambien reitero que no hay un Plan B pese al temor de algunos cientificos de que la pandemia no permitiria la inauguracion de los Juegos Olimpicos dentro de 15 meses, el 23 de julio de 2021.
 "No entraremos en conjeturas", dijo Takaya. "Las nuevas fechas han sido fijadas. El comite organizador de Tokio 2020 y todos los interesados se abocan a trabajar con la nueva fecha".

Dear Dave,   I'm debt-free except for my home, and it is all because I started following your plan four years ago. I'm even on track to pay off my mortgage in eight years. With all the scary economic news out there, I'd love to talk to my family about following your advice, too. Do you have any suggestions for doing this without sounding like a know-it-all or that I am bragging?   Lacey
 Dear Lacey,   It's been my experience that when it comes to family, words don't always do the trick. There's an old saying that goes, "Those convinced against their will are of the same opinion still." Some people have been brainwashed into believing credit cards and debt are an unavoidable part of life. They're stuck in their ways, and nothing anyone can say or do is going to change that.   I've been fortunate enough to help millions of people change their lives, get out of debt and take control of their finances. But there are millions more who will never listen. They'll just keep going deeper and deeper into debt, and never realize the real problem is the person they see in the mirror every morning.   The truth is, you can make irrefutable arguments against credit cards. People who use them spend more than those who use cash or debit cards. Research has proven this. You don't need one to rent a car, get a hotel room, or buy airline tickets. A debit card will do all those things without piling up debt. For an emergency fund, you can simply save up cash. It takes some discipline and hard work, but relying on credit when things go wrong is a really bad idea. It's a trap.   If they won't listen to all these truths, try telling them your story. Let them know you understand from experience how hard breaking old habits can be. Emphasize how amazing your life has been since you decided to actively control your money, instead allowing a lack of money to control you.   Congratulations, Lacey. I'm proud of you for working so hard and being disciplined. I hope you can be an influence on others in your family, and help lead them to a place of financial peace, too!   Dave

New Delhi, Apr 21 (PTI) Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday urged members of Rotary Clubs to come forward in involving more people in the country's fight against the deadly COVID-19.
 He also thanked the Rotarians for contributing Rs 26 crore to the PM-CARES fund.
 Interacting with the members via video conferencing, the minister said, "I really value Rotarians' contribution in our fight against COVID-19. Their effort is appreciable in terms of PM-CARES contribution, providing equipment, sanitisers, food, PPE kits and N95 masks for hospitals."
 "We all have to rise to the occasion and work together to defeat COVID-19 which has spread across 215 countries in the world," he said.
 Vardhan asserted that India was the first country to respond to China's disclosure about coronavirus to the world.
 "On the very next day, India initiated steps to monitor the situation and the first joint monitoring group meeting was held. Most of the countries are involved in developing vaccines and drugs for coronavirus. The world has been acknowledging the fact that India is placed much better than other countries in its fight against the infection," he said.
 The health minister also emphasised on the importance of "social vaccine" like following the principles of lockdown and social distancing till the time a vaccine is developed for treating COVID-19.
 "Many countries are involved in developing the much needed vaccine and drug for COVID-19 though it is going to be a long journey," he stated.
 The Ministry of Science and Technology, he said, is also been working on innovations and funding certain projects to make the testing procedure faster.
 "A low-cost diagnostic test kit that can confirm COVID-19 in just two hours has been developed by the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST). The test kit, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, called Chitra Gene LAMP-N, is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 N-gene. It can detect two regions of the gene which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread," he explained.
 Vardhan also highlighted the effectiveness of 'Aarogya Setu' mobile application in allaying the fears of the people about the disease.
 The application downloaded by more than 5 crore people has been developed by the government. It is aimed at augmenting the initiatives of the government, in proactively reaching out to and informing the users regarding risks, best practices and relevant advisories pertaining to the containment of COVID-19.
 The health ministry, he said, has also issued detailed guidelines on enabling delivery of essential health care services to meet the unprecedented demand on the current healthcare system amid the COVID-19 outbreak.
 Such patients may also be provided services related to tele-consultation, digital prescription and home delivery of medicines.
 Vardhan also exhorted Rotarians not to fall prey to rumour mongering and misinformation being spread by certain vested interests.
 "In order to overcome this situation, our government has issued 543 crore SMSs and introduced pre-recorded caller tune message which will be played before the start of actual conversation via mobile phones," the minister added.

Cape Town, Apr 21 (AFP) South African Rugby announced on Tuesday huge budget cuts and the cancellation of several events because of the coronavirus pandemic but said it still hoped scheduled Test matches for the world champion Springboks would go ahead.
 Chief executive of SA Rugby Jurie Roux said the sport's stakeholders had agreed to cut between R700 million (about US$36.8 million) and R1 billion (about US$52.6 million) from the budget for the next eight months against what he said was a "worst-case" scenario in which no rugby would be played during the period.
 The cuts will include salary reductions for officials and players.
 "Our income is tied to the playing of professional rugby and without matches we potentially don't have any income," said Roux.
 He said the decision had been agreed in principle by all stakeholders, including representatives of players.
 "These are unprecedented times, not only for rugby in South Africa, but across all spheres of life all over the globe," said Roux.
 Roux said all age group events with the exception of a planned under-21 provincial competition, had been scrapped, while all club rugby was on hold because the country was in lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
 But he said home Test matches against Scotland, on July 4 and July 11, remained on the schedule as well as a fixture against Georgia on July 18.
 The first Test against Scotland will hold special significance as it is likely to be the last match at the historic Newlands stadium in Cape Town.

Another look at the Good Old Days
 My brother and I used to say we grew up in the last of the Good Old Days in the Ozarks, and possibly we did. We were children throughout “the Fabulous Fifties,” a decade of unparalleled peace, prosperity and optimism for post- WWII white Americans.
 Of course, at the time we thought the “Good Old Days” were an even earlier era — the childhood decades of our parents. In fact, they saw the worst of times.
 Mom was born in 1922, a child of “The Roaring Twenties.” She hadn’t grown old enough to do much “roaring,” though, before the stock market crash of 1939. Mom was a school girl throughout the Great Depression and a college student during World War II.
 Born in 1926, Dad was just a toddler when the stock market crashed and a high school student at the onset of WWII. As quickly as possible after graduation he was in U.S. Navy boot camp.
 Mom was a town girl, the youngest of four children, and fortunate as a teen to find work at Doling Park. Grandpa was a sign painter and businessman in Springfield from soon after the turn of the century. Mom’s brothers were mechanics with their own garage prior to the war.
 Dad was the oldest of nine children. Grandma was the picture of a Depression- era mother, working daybreak to dusk tending garden, canning tomatoes and beans and caring for her burgeoning brood. Grandpa worked construction — mostly highway jobs in those days, following the work with his family. Grandpa told me he was once approached by a fellow willing to trade the deed to his farm for a weekly paycheck.
 “You’ve not seen my farm, and I’ve not seen your paycheck,” the man said. Grandpa said he couldn’t do it. His family depended on that check.
 Dad didn’t talk a lot about the hard times of his youth, other than tell how he caught and sold rabbits for a dime or so. Lest we complain about our supper, Dad also explained how he carried canned tomatoes to school for lunch. I found out in later year he deeply resented his Dad leaving the farm work to him and his younger brother while he was working construction jobs.
 In many ways, Dad never overcame his Depression-era mentality. A common mantra in the 1930s was, “Use it up, wear it out, make do or do without.”
 Dad lived it most of his life. Though well-educated and an astute cattle husbandman, he was conservative to a fault. His cattle ranch never exceeded 39 acres, and once he had that paid off he never borrowed another dime.
 In all his life he never owned a new pickup truck, or even a brand-new rifle or shotgun. But we never had to walk anywhere or failed to have game or fish on the table in season, if that’s what we wanted.
 As I write and think this through, I suppose my brother Russell and I were on the mark all along. Our were the best of the Good Old Days — the best for us and our folks, as well.
 I can only hope our kids look back on our more recent decades with the same fondness. If the years have taught me anything, it’s understanding that for every generation the “Good Old Days” are always right now.

A Nebraska dam that collapsed under pressure from an icy flood had a history of unaddressed ice issues and had no formal emergency plan because regulators wrongly assumed that no one would die if it failed, according a report released Tuesday. However, the investigation concluded there was nothing the dam's operators could have done in the early morning of March 14, 2019, to prevent Spencer Dam from failing after unusually intense snow and rain created a raging flood on the Niobrara River in rural northern Nebraska. Kenny Angel, who lived just beneath the dam, was found dead after the flood washed away his home and business. Workers for the Nebraska Public Power District, which operated the dam, warned Angel just minutes ahead of time of the impending danger. The failed dam was featured in an Associated Press investigation in November that found scores of dams nationwide in even worse condition, and in equally dangerous locations. The AP identified 1,688 high- hazard dams — meaning loss of life is likely if they fail — rated in poor or unsatisfactory condition as of last year in 44 states and Puerto Rico. Nebraska regulators had categorized Spencer Dam as a “significant hazard\" — a rating that meant no loss of life was expected if it failed, and no formal emergency action plan was required. Tuesday's report by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials said the dam should have been rated as “high hazard,” which it said could have led to a plan to modify it to increase its flood capacity. The report cited the wrong classification as one of two human factors contributing to the dam's failure and devastating consequences. It said state regulators were unaware the dam had failed under ice pressure in 1935 and been damaged by ice on the river in 1960 and 1966. The report said historical records about the...

 John Fox, Beaumont CEO, spoke Tuesday morning in a one-time-only interview with the media.
 Fox could not answer how the number of layoffs and job eliminations will impact employees at Beaumont's hospitals Downriver, located in Trenton and Taylor hospitals.
 "I don't have those numbers in front of me," he said. "I will tell you it's proportioned by the size of the facility. The most impacted facility is Royal Oak. They by far have the largest number of employees, so their numbers are the largest, and it goes down from there. The next two largest hospitals are Dearborn and Troy. So, again, it impacts everybody at Beaumont Health and it's across the board, but I don't have the specifics hospital by hospital."
 After Beaumont began caring for COVID-19 patients five weeks ago, nearly all inpatient and outpatient surgeries and other non-COVID-19 medical services had to be halted.
 In addition, the number of patients seeking care unrelated to COVID-19 dramatically declined after March 16.
 Fox said he will take a 70% temporary pay cut to his base salary, but would not elaborate on how that specifically impacts his financial numbers.
 The other members of Beaumont’s executive leadership team will also take temporary pay cuts up to 45% of their total compensation. Of the 2,475 temporary layoffs, most involve hospital administrative staff and others who are not directly caring for patients with or without COVID-19.
 Most of the 450 position eliminations are part of the corporate staff or are serving in other administrative roles.

The world on Monday woke up to the news that oil prices in the US had slipped into the negative, sending the traders into a tizzy. But Indian refiners will remain largely unfazed by the price crash in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices.
 WTI is a marker that reflects the price of crude oil in the American market. Crude purchases by India's domestic oil companies are priced closer to the Brent markers, which reflect prices in the Gulf region.
 According to Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, India’s largest public sector refiner, “The sharp decline in crude oil prices, ultimately plunging WTI into a historic minus $37.63 a barrel yesterday (on Monday), was a result of panic selling on May 20 delivery contracts a day before its expiry date, failing which the delivery would have been necessarily amid Covid-19 related demand destruction and the storage constraints at Cushing, Oklahoma. However, WTI futures for June 20 as well as ICE Brent for May 20 are still trading at around $16 a barrel and $ 21 a barrel respectively.”
 ## An one-off incident
 Explaining the situation, an executive from of one of the public sector oil companies said this is an one-off incident restricted to one region. “Yes, it will have implications. But on oil exploration and production companies and not refiners,” the executive said, adding that the US crude oil producers are now facing the heat.
 In fact, according to analysts, domestic companies may gain from this price fluctuation.
 “Indian oil marketing companies (OMCs) are likely to react positively to fall in crude prices. Currently, OMCs are making ₹13 a litre net marketing (margin) on petrol and diesel, which will likely improve on a fall of crude prices,” said Yogesh Patil, Research Analyst at Reliance Securities. According to Patil, a $1 a barrel fall in crude prices leads to a ₹0.45 a litre improvement in net marketing margins on petrol and diesel.
 “Current net marketing margins on petroleum products are around 7 times their normal margins,” he added.
 But the outlook for crude oil is expected to remain grim.
 Miren Lodha, Director, Crisil Research on Oil Prices said, “Crude oil demand is expected to decline by over 20 million barrels per day (mbpd)in April alone. Typically, monthly global demand is around 100 mbpd…Consequently, we expect Brent oil prices to be in the ~ $25-30 range for the second quarter while increasing marginally in the last 2 quarters of 2020. The gigantic inventory build-ups and lack of storage facilities would also put pressure on prices. Overall, Brent could average $30-35 in 2020, with a strong downward bias.”

GUAYAQUIL -- Venezuelan migrants in Ecuador are setting out on perilous journeys to return to their crisis-stricken homeland or to join family in other Latin American countries as a lockdown meant to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus has left them without work.
 Ecuador, with a population of 17.4 million, has over 10,000 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and more than 500 deaths.
 The outbreak has ravaged the economy of the oil-producing country and overwhelmed sanitary authorities in the largest city of Guayaquil, where corpses remained in homes or for hours on the streets.
 Venezuelan migrants, millions of whom fled economic crisis in their homeland, often work informal jobs or beg on the streets. Shutdowns of businesses across the region have cut many off from their meager income sources.
 "We were in Guayaquil, we've worked and now we're returning to Peru to see if it will go better for us there," said 19-year-old migrant Jose Roman, as he and his cousin thumbed for rides along a highway outside of the coastal city.
 "Here, we can't work and we don't have anywhere to live," said Roman, who used to work at a car wash. His construction-worker cousin Jeison Rodriguez, 20, said their aim was to join other family members in Peru.
 "We thought we would leave Guayaquil with money and be able to help my family in Caracas, but we couldn't do anything, except thank God that we're leaving alive and healthy."
 Some migrants have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, said Daniel Regalado, president of the Venezuelan Civic Association of Ecuador, while others have been evicted from rooms they were renting.
 "Venezuelans in Ecuador are suffering hunger and it's regrettable," said Regalado. "Since last week, people have been arriving to Quito, walking from Guayaquil to return to Venezuela."
 Other migrant groups have decried the evictions and urged fellow Venezuelans not to make unplanned journeys home.
 Elsewhere in Guayaquil, larger groups of migrants, including children, lugged suitcases or pushed strollers piled high with belongings as they sought rides.
 Migrants hoping for better opportunities in other Latin American countries will first face closed land borders meant to stem the spread of the virus.
 Those who manage to make it home by crossing borders informally or snagging a spot on humanitarian transport will likely be ordered into quarantine in makeshift shelters along the border.
 The Venezuelan government has said it expects around 15,000 migrants to return, a fraction of the five million who have left the country in recent years.

Lausanne, Apr 21 (AFP) UEFA remains committed to completing the suspended football season in Europe despite the coronavirus pandemic after making "a strong recommendation" on Tuesday that leagues across the continent be played to a conclusion.
 "There was a strong recommendation given to finish domestic top division and cup competitions," European football's governing body said in a statement after holding a videoconference with its 55 member associations.
 However, it added that "some special cases will be heard once guidelines concerning participation to European competitions -- in case of a cancelled league -- have been developed."
 That could be of particular interest to Belgium and Scotland, whose top flights appear to have been awaiting a green light from UEFA to call an end to their seasons now.
 UEFA said any decisions would be announced after its Executive Committee meets on Thursday. Before that it is due to meet with the powerful European Club Association (ECA) and the European Leagues grouping, which represents nearly a thousand clubs in 29 countries, on Wednesday.
 League seasons were halted in mid-March as the coronavirus spread across Europe.
 Some 106,737 deaths due to Covid-19 had been recorded in Europe by Tuesday. Italy, Spain and France have all officially recorded over 20,000 deaths while there have been more than 17,000 in the United Kingdom.
 However, Germany has coped better than most of its neighbours and the German Bundesliga is set to become the first leading league to attempt to restart its season, with clubs expected to agree to a May 9 resumption when they meet on Thursday.
 In Italy, all 20 Serie A clubs voted unanimously on Tuesday to complete the season, albeit they will only do so "if the government authorises it and in full compliance with the rules for the protection of health and safety".
 Initially following the suspension, the end of June had been set out as the target date for finishing the season, but UEFA has since been working on the possibility of playing in July and August.
 It is understood that the scenario drawn up by a UEFA working group is based around completing the Champions League in August, with the final in Istanbul possibly on August 29.
 The Champions League and Europa League are currently on hold "until further notice", with both stuck in the last-16 stage.
 UEFA has already postponed Euro 2020 by a year. They are also likely to put the next women's European Championship back by a year to 2022.
 Despite UEFA's stance, football is at the mercy of the virus and of national governments who have adopted strict lockdown measures to try to halt its spread.
 The Belgian Pro League has previously stated its intention to declare the season finished, but was warned earlier this month by UEFA that its clubs risked being excluded from the next Champions League if it did so unilaterally.
 The decision was unanimously approved by the Pro League board at the start of the month and could be rubber-stamped at a meeting next Monday.
 Meanwhile, Scotland has already declared the season over in the leagues below the top flight and could do the same for the Premiership if UEFA does not object, meaning Celtic would be champions. AFP

Air travel has been one of the hardest-hit industries in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Almost as soon as news of the virus became widespread in late-January, travel demand to Asia from the rest of the world plummeted. Even before the containment was adopted across the globe, airlines began to drastically cut flights to China, and other locations in Asia as coronavirus-related anxieties led passengers to avoid travel to the region.
 Within weeks, however, it became apparent that flights to Asia were not the only routes to see lower demand.
 As the virus spread to Europe, followed by the Americas and Africa, passenger demand plummeted across the board. People were second-guessing trips anywhere away from home, and were trying to avoid anything involving air travel, given the inherent close proximity to other people, some of whom could be carrying the virus.
 Notably, people were also delaying buying tickets for future travel, due to the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak.

NEW YORK (AP) — As state and federal leaders tussle over when and how fast to “reopen” the U.S. economy amid the coronavirus pandemic, some corporations are taking the first steps toward bringing their employees back to work. Which in many cases is easier said than done.
 Detroit-area automakers, which suspended production roughly a month ago, are pushing to restart factories as states like Michigan prepare to relax their stay-at-home orders. Fiat Chrysler has already announced a May 4 gradual restart date; General Motors and Ford don't want to be left behind.
 In negotiations with the United Auto Workers union, automakers are offering to provide protective gear, frequently sanitize equipment, and to take worker temperatures to prevent anyone with a fever from entering factories. These steps, they say, have worked at repurposed factories now making medical equipment.
 Matt Himes, who installs SUV doors at a GM plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, said he’s ready to get back to work. But he also fears catching the virus.
 “I guess we all should worry about it, but you can’t keep us closed down forever,” said Himes, who added that it’s impossible to keep social distance on his assembly line. “You work within 3 or 4 feet from everybody,” he said. “People right across from you, people right beside you.”

While I am happy to report today that all five of our plants are running and they are running at somewhere between 95% and 105% of capacity, which means that essentially the Chinese market is quite active and we are making up for losses. The closures in India and China had even larger impacts on sales and orders, we usually don’t report sales on a quarterly basis but to give you an indication and these exceptional times our Q1 sales are down 2.2% adjusted for 4x and 4.3% organically.

Health officials fear that such moves, if not carefully planned, could fuel a second wave of COVID-19 infections. Some companies that never closed offer a cautionary tale: Meat-packing plants across the Midwest have reported hundreds of coronavirus cases among their tightly quartered workforces. Several have shuttered in an attempt to stem the spread.
 Above all else, executives will need to be flexible, said Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University. “You can have a set of plans, but those plans are going to have to be updated on a rolling basis,” he said. “The forecast is incredibly uncertain.”
 Retailers, restaurants and mall operators are looking at China’s experience to see how they can reopen stores, said Meghann Martindale, global head of research at CBRE, a real estate services firm. Malls, for instance, probably won’t open food courts and big play areas for children for a while, and shopping complexes will likely limit the number of entrances to control the flow of customers.
 Build-A-Bear Workshop, which operates 350 mostly mall-based stores in the U.S., is exploring new ways to ease coronavirus fears, such as letting families make appointments so they can customize and stuff their own plush toys without strangers around, said founder and former CEO Maxine Clark. It’s also giving its workers masks that feature bears so they won’t be scary for children.
 Amazon, which drew sharp criticism for firing an employee who led a walkout to demand greater coronavirus protection for workers, now says it is developing an internal lab that could potentially provide coronavirus tests for all employees, even those without symptoms. “We think it’s worth trying, and we stand ready to share anything we learn,” CEO Jeff Bezos wrote in a recent letter to shareholders.
 Many technology companies embraced stay-at-home policies early on, since most of their workers can do their jobs remotely.

"The face mask directs much of the exhaled air upwards where it gets into contact with the spectacle lenses. The misting occurs from the warm water vapour content condensing on the cooler surface of the lens, and forming tiny droplets that scatter the light and reduce the ability of the lens to transmit contrast. The droplets form because of the inherent surface tension between the water molecules. Washing the spectacles with soapy water leaves behind a thin surfactant film that reduces this surface tension and causes the water molecules to spread out evenly into a transparent layer. This 'surfactant effect' is widely utilised to prevent misting of surfaces in many everyday situations," the study said.

 "I'm thrilled to join Visions, both in the U.S. and across the world, through our widespread consultant team, including our work in Arlington," Dadsetan- Foley said.
 Dadsetan-Foley has worked on five continents doing social justice, development and humanitarian work, including with the World Bank.
 She's been an activist from an early age, concerned and fighting for the environment, homelessness and refugees since childhood, and she's excited to bring that energy to Boston.
 "I feel very humbled to join the Visions community," she said, adding that she is very excited to come on board and support Visions in continuing to do the work they do, across the country and the world.
 She chose to settle into work in the U.S. after nearly a decade abroad, after she rescued her German shepherd mix, Server, from Lebanon -- a choice that brought her back to be closer to her family, and which eventually led her to meeting her now-partner, Sean Dadsetan-Foley, in Baltimore.
 She has made the "first real home" of her adult life in Duxbury -- after time in France, Lebanon, Tajikistan, Sierra Leone and Iraq -- and looks forward to continuing the work Visions started over 35 years ago.
 "I am delighted to welcome Elika to Visions. [The] Visions board decided in early 2019 that our work was clearly needed in the world more than ever and that it was time to find a new leader who could guide us into the future. Our vision is to be a catalyst for a more equitable world where differences are valued and utilized for the benefit of all. Elika's passion and life's work are so synchronous with this view; the breadth and depth of her experience in living into this vision will enhance all of our ability to help achieve this goal," said Batts.

So, we've had relatively – we've had some issues on timing of ingredients. Those are much better than they were a few weeks ago. Production facilities are largely running. We made a lot of adaptations to ensure safety and sanitation and security for the employees and that's true over the concentrate plants and most of the bottling plants just a couple of places that we see some plant shutdown. And then distribution, we've largely kept up and running everywhere and doubled down on that. Yes. There are issues in the odd countries here and there on the – on availability of – in some of the logistics for drivers or having to swap drivers at borders. But generally speaking, it's been – we've been able to adapt and it's the great strength of having ultimately a local supply chain in each country. And yeah, there are some parts of the supply chain that are running 24/7 and there are some places – parts like the fountain supply that are much more low utilization. And we'll have to manage through that as we see how these graduated re-openings start to take place in the coming months and quarters.

So that's our approach and I certainly have a personal view as to the recovery but I would never dare to venture on a call with guys like you that also have your own view and at the end of the day nobody knows.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Sixty-one more Indiana residents have died from COVID-19, pushing the state's pandemic death toll to 630 as statewide coronavirus cases surpassed 12,000, state health officials said Tuesday. The Indiana State Department of Health said the 61 new deaths it reported Tuesday occurred between April 7 and Monday. The state agency said that another 431 Indiana residents have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, bringing the state’s total to 12,097, following corrections to the previous day’s total. A total of 67,264 tests have been reported to the state health department, with the addition of another 2,641 tests the agency reported Tuesday. The health department said in a news release that the new cases and new tests reported Tuesday were lower than expected due to a technology issue “and should not be interpreted as a decline in new infections.\" The department said the additional positive cases not included in Tuesday’s report “would be captured in the coming days and reflected appropriately.\" Dr. Kristina Box, the state health commissioner, has said that she expected the coronavirus illness peak to arrive in late April for the Indianapolis area and the first weeks of May for rest of the state.

You can only use it for capital improvement projects and then you have to pay 10 percent on whatever money they give you. This money has no strings attached we can use it for operating expenses, salaries and wages, we can use it for utility payments to keep the lights on. We can use it for runway paint, signage, whatever we need to make sure we are fully operational, and we can use some of that money to help recover the local economy,” Valgardson says.

A Nebraska dam that collapsed under pressure from an icy flood had a history of unaddressed ice issues and had no formal emergency plan because regulators wrongly assumed that no one would die if it failed, according a report released Tuesday.
 However, the investigation concluded there was nothing the dam's operators could have done in the early morning of March 14, 2019, to prevent Spencer Dam from failing after unusually intense snow and rain created a raging flood on the Niobrara River in rural northern Nebraska.
 Kenny Angel, who lived just beneath the dam, was found dead after the flood washed away his home and business. Workers for the Nebraska Public Power District, which operated the dam, warned Angel just minutes ahead of time of the impending danger.
 The failed dam was featured in an Associated Press investigation in November that found scores of dams nationwide in even worse condition, and in equally dangerous locations. The AP identified 1,688 high-hazard dams — meaning loss of life is likely if they fail — rated in poor or unsatisfactory condition as of last year in 44 states and Puerto Rico.
 Nebraska regulators had categorized Spencer Dam as a “significant hazard" — a rating that meant no loss of life was expected if it failed, and no formal emergency action plan was required. Tuesday's report by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials said the dam should have been rated as “high hazard,” which it said could have led to a plan to modify it to increase its flood capacity.
 The report cited the wrong classification as one of two human factors contributing to the dam's failure and devastating consequences. It said state regulators were unaware the dam had failed under ice pressure in 1935 and been damaged by ice on the river in 1960 and 1966. The report said historical records about the dam were lost, unorganized or unavailable.
 As a result, “while the dam appeared to be well maintained, no provisions were made to pass or prepare for ice run events,” the report said.

The slide says that over 90% of our employees worldwide are working. It's actually more than that. It was 90% until a few days ago when India was still closed for us as it is for all other companies but at the end of last week we have got dispensation to reopen our India facilities as a provider of essential services. We have got the authorization to reopen with 45% of our people. So a bit less than 50% capacity and our pumps facility is already back up and running. Pumps and Service and our Chemtech facility is still working through some regulatory constraints but will be back up and running at some time this week. So the 90% is probably closer to 95% today.

HILO, Hawaii (AP) — Daily arrests on Hawaii’s Big Island have plunged 33% since the governor issued a stay-at-home order because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Hawaii County Police Department said.Hawaii Police Chief Ferreira confirmed the decrease in arrests during the period after Democratic Gov. David Ige’s emergency proclamation took effect March 25, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Monday.The decrease has various explanations, including an expanded use of citations by officers to deal with some crimes, Ferreira said.“We’re not actively going out there and pursuing (suspects on) bench warrants,” Ferreira said. “In other words, if you got a traffic ticket in February, and you got a bench warrant for not appearing in court, we’re not even looking at those warrants.”Arrests for bench warrants would likely result in release and a court dates later in the year, Ferreira said.Another factor in reduced arrest figures is the smaller number of people committing crimes in their vehicles, including driving under the influence.“Because the bars are closed, and because of the stay-at-home order, you have less people on the roadway,” Ferreira said.Officers continue to arrest people wanted for violating terms of parole, Ferreira said.“And any sort of violent crime, those arrests are going to happen,” he said.Some who have been arrested and charged with serious property crimes have had judges eliminate their cash bail during their initial court appearances because of state Supreme Court-mandated population reductions in the state’s jails and prisons because of the coronavirus.“Nobody wants to see an outbreak, anywhere, and officers don’t want to crowd the jails, either,” Ferreira said.County police retain primary responsibility for enforcing the 14-day quarantine of visitors arriving on interisland flights, Ferreira said.“Right now, the process that is in place is Hawaii Tourism Authority collects the names and gets the information at the airports,” Ferreira said. “That information is passed on to Civil Defense and, in turn, our dispatch center.”Police have also been busy with those who violate the emergency stay-at-home order and social distancing requirements, he said.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Insomma, la storica cancellazione di dogmi e imperi ha portato solo disgregazione e atomismo, e allora il “noi” nega gli “altri”, dietro l’angolo brulicano nazionalismi e populismi, si riaffaccia Hobbes con la sua società di lupi e tagliole, e la peculiarità di ogni esistenza è solo quella di resistere sotto la frusta dei pastori o in un micro-superomismo odioso e suicida.

"Comprendiamo le difficoltà del neo nominato amministratore di CSP, che evidentemente deve parare le bordate che gli arrivano dalla sua stessa maggioranza e persino dal sindaco, ma se vuole distrarre l’attenzione dovrebbe farlo contando meglio. Le cifre sparate qualche giorno fa dall’avvocato Carbone, condite da giudizi poco eleganti su suoi colleghi, riguardano due anni del precedente consiglio di amministrazione (cda), mentre per se stesso riferisce cifre di un singolo anno. L’attuale cda, mancante di un membro, prenderà meno e precisamente 109.000 euro, ma a prescindere dalla qualità del lavoro svolto, come deciso in assemblea dei soci. Il precedente cda percepiva circa 170.000 euro all'anno comprensive di parte variabile, che veniva erogata solo al raggiungimento dei risultati. Si tratta di cifre ben distanti dai 670.000 euro sparati dall’avvocato Carbone, così come il mezzo milione di rimborsi del biennio 2018-2019 che in realtà sono stati di circa 90.000 euro. L'organo di revisione precedente costava 9.000 euro l'anno, mentre l’attuale costerà di più in quanto formato da ben 3 componenti, ognuno dei quali percepirà rimborsi spese. Per quello che riguarda i dirigenti da quanto ne sappiamo ce n’è solamente uno,l’avvocato Paolo Iarlori, assunto a tempo indeterminato nel 2007 senza alcuna procedura di selezione pubblica, tra l’altro esponente di Fratelli d’Italia. Oggi leggiamo di un non meglio identificato gruppo di dirigenti interni, che evidentemente erano già presenti quando le partecipate hanno raggiunto 40 milioni di debiti, risolti dall'amministrazione M5S senza chiedere un euro ai civitavecchiesi. Apprendiamo che i suddetti dirigenti oggi si ridurrebbero lo stipendio, ma la stessa generosità non l’abbiamo vista durante il nostro piano di risanamento…come mai?
