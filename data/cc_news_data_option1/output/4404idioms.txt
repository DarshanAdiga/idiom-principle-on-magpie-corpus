В итоге решили сделать так: дизайнер по костюмам Уолтер Планкетт перетянул грудь Вивьен Ли липкой лентой, чтобы придать ей объем.

As many golfers age, whether they played their first game recently or have avidly golfed their entire life, strength of the swing can begin to dwindle. This can affect your golf game as the ball is unable to travel as far. Along with that comes range of motion and flexibility, on the backswing and on follow through. When it comes to playing a consistent golf game and keeping the mulligans to a minimum, these factors play a major roll. For the aging golfer, CBD is one of the best natural alternatives for keeping your golf game on point.

A vegan diet is surely a healthier diet, and scientific studies show that diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, rheumatism and allergies, also considered chronic diseases, are seen much less in vegans, said cardiology and internal medicine doctor.      Murat Kınıkoğlu, an internist and cardiologist practicing in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, said that his journey into veganism started at age 54 after his brother passed away from a heart attack and because his parents and siblings were all cardiac patients.      “Until that day, I knew cardiovascular diseases were inevitable, that they could happen to anyone at a certain age. While I was thinking about the day I would have a heart attack, I read studies by Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn’s studies which show that the heart vessels are widened with plant- based diets,” Kınıkoğlu said.      Ornish and Esselstyn are both physicians in the U.S. that have conducted research and authored publications on plant-based diets.      “As I dealt with the subject, I found that the only way to avoid heart disease was a low-fat vegan diet, and I radically changed my diet. Over time, I discovered the ethical aspects of a vegan diet, and experiencing the beauty of the feeling of not harming animals reinforced my decision to choose this diet.” Kınıkoğlu explained that being ve-gan reduces your risk of getting the 50 most common diseases such as high blood pressure, promotes mental wellbeing at an older age and reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.      He also noted that if fat and sugar are cut in addition to a vegan diet, the risk of a heart attack, breast cancer among women and prostate cancer among men is reduced by 30 percent.      Regarding the controversial issue of protein, Kınıkoğlu said all proteins consist of 20 essential amino acids and that the human body makes 12 of these while eight are supplied from outside.      “The main source of essential amino acids are plants, because plants can make 20 of these 20 amino acids themselves, unlike mammals. All of the proteins found in animal products are found in plants, and it does not matter where you get the protein from,” he said.      “Whether you eat eggs, oats or spinach, the protein entering your stomach is first broken down into amino acids, then mixed into the blood from the stomach and intestinal wall. After entering the cells, they form new proteins by forming chains again. In this respect, the type and amount of the amino acid is important, not where it comes from,” he noted.      “I think my colleagues do not follow scientific publications carefully enough, or they read them, but they do not change their minds because they look at these events with a biased perspective. A doctor who smokes does not urge his patients to quit smoking, and doctors who eat meat cannot tell their patients how harmful meat is because they are eating it themselves,” he said, noting he was among the minority of doctors that defend the diet.      Kınıkoğlu said scientific studies show that a smart vegan diet does not cause any deficiencies, but rather there are more pros than cons.      Kınıkoğlu emphasized the environmental dimension of the issue and said normally, it takes two years for cattle to be slaughtered.      This period is reduced to four months with hormone applications on modern farms and growth hormones and high-calorie foods are given to cows to increase milk production.      “A breeding farm with 2,500 dairy cows excretes as much as a city of 41,000. Breeders collect animal waste in large pits, but nitrate in the feces leaks into the groundwater and our rivers. Then we wonder why there were mass fish deaths in such and such river. Nitrate and ammonia in the feces reach our seas by the rivers, and areas in which life cannot survive begin to appear,” Kınıkoğlu said.      “Another problem with feces is E. Coli and other microbes. The amount of feces produced by livestock is 100 times higher than the amount of feces in humans. Let’s not forget that the antibiotics, chemicals and hormones given to these animals in these feces go into the soil, the environment, and the sea,” he noted.      Kınıkoğlu stressed that the best thing a person can do for themselves, for their children and family, for the environment and for the whole world is to become vegan.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Wages and benefits for U.S. workers grew slowly this summer as employers sought to hold the line on pay gains in the midst of the pandemic.
 U.S. workers' total compensation rose 0.5% in the July-September quarter, the second straight quarter of slower growth in wages, the Labor Department said Friday. Growth was the same as in the April-June quarter. That's down from 0.8% in the first three months of the year.
 For the year ending in September, wages and benefits increased 2.4%, the slowest pace in three years. The data comes from the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index, which measures pay changes for workers that keep their jobs. The data isn't affected by the mass layoffs in the spring.
 The figures suggest that businesses are holding the line on labor costs, even as they recall millions of the workers that were laid off in March and April when the coronavirus outbreak forced the closures of thousands of businesses nationwide. Still, the U.S. has regained barely more than half the 22 million jobs lost to the pandemic. The unemployment rate is a still-high 7.9%, though that is down from its 14.7% peak in April.
 Pay and benefits fell in the third quarter for employees of colleges, universities and professional schools, for the first time since 2009, during the Great Recession. Compensation for those workers dropped 0.4%, compared with a gain of 0.6% in the second quarter.
 Colleges and universities are struggling with declining enrollments amid the pandemic, with many classes conducted online.
 Wages for state and local government employees increased just 0.1% in the third quarter, the slowest pace in seven years. State and local governments have also been forced to cut jobs as tax revenues fall. Most states are legally required to balance their budgets.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal laws and long-standing custom generally leave the U.S. military out of the election process. But President Donald Trump's unsubstantiated warnings about widespread voting irregularities have raised questions about a possible military role.
 If any element of the military were to get involved, it would likely be the National Guard under state control. These citizen soldiers could help state or local law enforcement with any major election-related violence. But the Guard's more likely roles will be less visible — filling in as poll workers, out of uniform, and providing cybersecurity expertise in monitoring potential intrusions into election systems.
 Unlike regular active-duty military, the Guard answers to its state's governor, not the president. Under limited circumstances, Trump could federalize them, but in that case, they would generally be barred from doing law enforcement.
 A look at the potential National Guard role in the election:
 WHAT MIGHT THE GUARD DO?
 Governors could activate the Guard to help with security in the event of violence. That happened this week in Pennsylvania amid demonstrations over the police killing of Walter Wallace Jr. in Philadelphia. The mayor's office said the city requested that the Pennsylvania National Guard help with "the current situation and election preparation."
 In some states, Guard members in civilian clothes were used as poll workers during primary elections because of shortages caused by the pandemic. The Guard in New Jersey is helping with balloting now, and other states including Wisconsin say they may use the Guard at the polls.
 Stephen Dycus, professor emeritus at Vermont Law School, said states can, if necessary, deploy uniformed Guard troops to help keep order at the polls. But, he said, "there's a very fine line between protection and intimidation. So any activity that is designed to intimidate voters or suppress voting violates federal election laws."
 In preparation for any emergencies, including civil unrest surrounding the election, the National Guard has already designated military police units in two states to serve as rapid-reaction forces. According to the Guard, about 600 troops — 300 in both Alabama and Arizona — will be ready to deploy within 24 hours if requested by a governor in another state. National Guard leaders have bought additional protective equipment and have increased troop training on proper procedures during protests.
 COULD TRUMP FEDERALIZE THE GUARD?
 Federal law permits a president to federalize the Guard under very limited circumstances, including when he is "unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States." This language may be open to interpretation, but in the context of next week's election, it appears to allow federalization only if there is a fundamental breakdown in state and local officials' ability to conduct voting and vote counting.
 If the president federalizes Guard troops, they are then under his control, not the governor's. And the president can order them into a state without the governor's permission.
 William Banks, professor at Syracuse University College of Law, said that sending uniformed troops to the polls, including the Guard, would be unwise.
 "The overriding point is that we don't want the military involved in our civilian affairs. It just cuts against the grain of our history, our conditions, our values, our laws," he said.
 WHAT ABOUT THE ACTIVE-DUTY MILITARY?
 Senior military and defense leaders have said repeatedly that they believe there is no role for America's active-duty troops in an election.
 Legal experts say two laws expressly forbid the use of active-duty or federalized National Guard troops at the polls. Banks said one law criminalizes the use of military at the polls unless it is "necessary to repel armed enemies of the United States." A second law prohibits any voting interference or intimidation at the polls by armed forces.
 Under the Posse Comitatus Act, active-duty troops cannot be used for civil law enforcement. A president can, in extreme cases, invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act to use the military for law enforcement. If Trump were to invoke the Insurrection Act in a situation short of an extreme emergency, he might face resistance from Pentagon leaders and could also face a swift court challenge.
 During civil unrest in June, Trump considered invoking that act to use active- duty troops for law enforcement. Military leaders were opposed; it never happened.
 Dycus said the Insurrection Act can be used only if civil law enforcement can't handle the problem. And Banks said the president would first have to issue a proclamation calling for the violence to stop.
 WHAT ARE STATES PLANNING?
 Many states say they have no plans to activate their Guard for election duties, while a few have already done so. Army Brig. Gen. Robyn Blader, an assistant adjutant general with the Wisconsin National Guard, said Wednesday that state officials had made no decision on whether to use Guard members as poll workers, which they did in three elections this year because of COVID-19 problems.
 Maj. Gen. Daryl L. Bohac, who as Nebraska's adjutant general is the head of its National Guard, told reporters his state sees no prospect of Guard forces being federalized during the election. He said governors are already considering contingencies, "and they would be the focal point for any use of National Guard for any civil unrest or disturbance following the election."
 In Delaware and Washington state, Guard members will provide election-related cybersecurity assistance. In Tennessee, the Guard is opening drill facilities in rural areas for use as polling stations, but the Guard will play no direct role.
 And in Ohio, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine says he'll do what's needed.
 "I will not hesitate if a mayor requests that help," he said, adding that if law enforcement asks for help, "we'll have that discussion, and then we can certainly deploy the National Guard. We hope that that's not necessary."
