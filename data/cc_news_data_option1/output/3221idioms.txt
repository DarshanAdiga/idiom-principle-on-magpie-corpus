El Greco’s weird, riveting _Agony in the Garden_ , from 1590–95 is here in this room. The Toledo museum owns it, and it’s among the stars of any El Greco show. I’ve seen it many times over the years. The subject of Jesus at Gethsemene is tried and true, but no ever ever conceived it as El Greco did. In a big breach of doctrinal correctness, El Greco borrowed from all four Gospels. Most audacious is his discontinuous, fantasy space. He places the sleeping Apostles in a bubble, implying both their dreaming state and their separation from Jesus’s moment of absorbing the divine light emanating from a hefty angel kneeling on a cliff. Jesus wears a dramatically faceted red robe and kneels on an electric blue blanket. He’s framed by another cliff, which seems to envelope him. A full moon lights a tiny group of soldiers in the distance, coming to arrest him.

Tens of thousands of jobs have also been lost across the high street as retailers and hospitality businesses have borne the brunt of the crisis.
 The department store sector has been far from immune, with the John Lewis Partnership recently announcing that 1300 jobs were at risk as a result of a reorganisation of its business.
 Debenhams has been in administration since April, when the nationwide coronavirus lockdown brought many retailers' revenues to a sudden halt.
 This month, the company and its hedge fund backers - which include Silver Point Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management - launched an auction through the investment bank Lazard in an attempt to secure new investors.
 A number of parties are said to have expressed an interest, although analysts believe it is unlikely that a buyer will emerge for Debenhams in its current form.
 The company wants to conclude the sale process by the end of next month.
 In a statement this weekend, a spokesman for the department store chain said: "Debenhams is trading strongly, with 124 stores reopened and a healthy cash position.
 "As a result, and as previously stated, the administrators of Debenhams Retail Ltd have initiated a process to assess ways for the business to exit its protective administration.
 "The administrators have appointed advisors to help them assess the full range of possible outcomes which include the current owners retaining the business, potential new joint venture arrangements (with existing and potential new investors) or a sale to a third party."
 The company declined to comment specifically on the involvement of Hilco, but one insider pointed to administrator FRP Advisory's responsibility to establish whether Debenhams could trade solvently, be sold or liquidated.
 The business has performed ahead of expectations since the bulk of its stores were able to reopen in June and does not need to borrow money for the foreseeable future, the insider added.
 Hilco, which briefly acquired the Oasis and Warehouse brands after they collapsed into administration earlier this year, also worked with Debenhams on the permanent closure of 18 stores this year.
 The drawing up of contingency plans for Debenhams's liquidation represents another turbulent chapter for a business which traces its roots to 1778.
 It fell into administration in the spring of last year after a bitter public battle with the Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley, whose Frasers Group had become its biggest shareholder.
 Mr Ashley is reported to want to acquire up to 30 of Debenhams's sites.
 For much of its history, Debenhams was highly profitable, becoming an established anchor tenant on many high streets and in shopping centres around the UK.

While the model isn't entirely new to the industry — senior discounts and happy hours, after all, have been around for a while — von Massow believes it will become much more common.
 Another possible pricing change: non-refundable deposits for reservations. Restricted capacity, von Massow argues, means consumers' no-shows have become even more expensive for restaurants.
 A non-refundable deposit for reservations "makes sense and protects the restaurant without costing consumers who dine in anything," he wrote.
 Lefebvre says while he's heard anecdotally of some establishments raising prices, the industry is also highly aware that many consumers are also stretched thin.
 Raising prices is just one of many possible ways to adapt to the challenges of the new normal, he says. Some restaurants have added new revenue streams by taking on catering or meal-prep services, he notes, adding that it's too soon to tell which strategies will go mainstream.

Now it has recalled the loan and ended the oil credit facility. China has stepped in to help Islamabad with emergency cash, but in the meantime a $6-billion loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund is on ice. Islamabad's ties with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) too have soured. The provocation is Kashmir, on which both the UAE and Saudi Arabia have ignored Pakistan's wishes because Gulf politics is no longer what it was.

 Dario Saric on the other hand was absolutely phenomenal over these eight games. He is a prime example of where the Suns, or another team, could jump to conclusions with him just from what they saw in the bubble. Reggie Miller during the broadcast on TNT during the Suns' final game even commented about the fact that he was doing things that they did not see during his time in Philly. There were even some things he did that we didn't see even for a lot of this season. Diving toward the basket, offensive rebounds and overall post play looked as good as ever. But what will the Suns do with him being a restricted free agent? I'll be curious to see if they broker a similar deal to what the Suns did with Oubre last offseason.

Cars lined up at ports while trains and planes filled out fast as British tourists scurried to get out of France on Friday before a deadline that would require them to quarantine at home for two weeks.Families cut summer vacations short and other travellers made hasty plans to return to the U.K. by whatever means possible before the 4 a.m. Saturday deadline. Eurostar trains between Paris and London and airport lounges that were almost empty earlier in the coronavirus pandemic filled with passengers. Those with more means opted for private jets.The exodus was prompted by the British government's decision late Thursday to take France off a list of nations exempt from traveler quarantine requirements because of a sharp rise there in new virus infections. For those who cannot work from home on their return, the mandatory self-quarantine could see them penalized financially.The U.K. move has the potential to upend the plans of those planning trips in the days ahead, particularly of families during the run-up to schools reopening in September. French businesses running campsites in Brittany, wine-tasting tours in the Loire Valley or mountain treks in the Alps also have reason to worry.The French government has indicated it will respond in kind to Britain's decision, further hobbling travel and tourism at a time when the industry is trying to recover from the economic shock of the pandemic.Philip Alston, who was looking after three cats for a French couple in Paris, made the decision -- albeit reluctantly -- to return to the U.K."Fortunately, they said in the case of this happening, they had a stand-by helper," he said at the Gare du Nord station in Paris ahead of boarding a Eurostar train to London. "So I'm really upset because I was having a good time looking after the cats and exploring Paris."The British government insists it had to make the decision in light of a 66% spike in confirmed coronavirus cases in France in the past week. The Netherlands, Malta, Monaco and the Caribbean islands of Aruba and Turks & Caicos were also added to the U.K.'s quarantine list for the same reason.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the decision shouldn't have been a big surprise since the government had consistently said it would monitor infection rates when assessing its list of safe countries."Unfortunately, this virus doesn't play ball," he told Sky News.The decision means returnees from the two most popular European summer holiday destinations for British tourists face quarantining. Last month, Spain, the number one destination, was taken off the exempt list.In France, there's a growing fear of a second spike of the outbreak. Health authorities on Friday reported 2,846 new virus cases in 24 hours, bringing the total for the week to over 12,900. The head of the country's national health service said Paris and Marseille, have been declared at-risk zones."The situation is deteriorating from week to week," Director General of Health Jerome Salomon said on France Inter radio.Dr. Michael Head, a global health specialist at the University of Southampton, said the quarantine rules are appropriate given that many of the U.K.'s virus-related deaths were due to cases imported from abroad."That is a risk when booking a holiday or travel abroad right now, and this will remain a risk for some time to come," he said.Given the short warning, most British vacationers already in France, thought to number up to half a million, will stay abroad. But those that want to get back will find it tough.Eurostar, which operates high-speed passenger trains linking London and Paris, said it had limited availability remaining Friday. And Getlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel car-carrying rail service between Britain and France, said all trains set to arrive back in the U.K. before the quarantine comes into force are full -- even after it increased capacity.Ferry companies added extra services, too, but they filled up fast.DFDS scheduled four extra departures from France's port of Calais to "help repatriate customers" and insisted all travelers book before arriving at the port.P&O also warned customers it was "expecting large queues for tourist passenger traffic in Calais" and that its "sailings are already very busy this weekend with no additional capacity."Others are being more extravagant. Private jet charter company PrivateFly said demand for flights out of the countries removed from the safe list has trebled since the announcement was made.Though the U.K. has the highest official coronavirus death toll in Europe and the fifth-highest in the world, with almost 47,000 people having died after testing positive for COVID-19, its infection rates are considered to be lower than in many other European countries.France's junior minister for European affairs, Clement Beaune, voiced regret over Britain's move and said it would "prompt a retaliatory measure, in the hope of getting back to normal as soon as possible."France was studying how best to put in place the promised reciprocal quarantine measures but the Foreign Ministry said they would be operative quickly.The Netherlands accepted being put on the U.K.'s quarantine list without talk of retaliation."If a country decides for its own internal reasons that it doesn't want Dutch people, we're not going to hit back," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said at his post-Cabinet meeting press conference Friday.The U.K.'s quarantine approach has been criticized by many companies, including London's Heathrow Airport, which is urging the government to ramp up testing of all arrivals in the country. The government has said that it is no "silver bullet."As people headed back to the U.K., there was a general understanding of why the quarantine was put in place."I think all countries need to take strong action to prevent the spread of the COVID virus," said Eric Livingstone, who was heading back to the U.K. from Calais. "It's unpleasant, it's very inconvenient, it's expensive but it's necessary, I'm afraid."(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Il Milan è sempre interessato a Nikola Milenkovic. Commisso non è disposto a trattare sul prezzo del difensore. Pioli però ha espressamente richiesto il serbo. Maldini e Massara nell'affare vogliono inserire Paquetà, il brasiliano piace ai viola. Il Milan quindi ci proverà mettendo sul piatto Paquetà, il quale per i rossoneri vale 35 milioni e aggiungerà 10 milioni cash anche se i viola non ci sentono. Lo scrive _Tuttosport_.

This space was a funnel packed with French people. No one could see unless standing immediately in front of the cases.

The deal merged the club with Red Bull Brasil, a franchise founded by the company in 2007 that was playing in a state-level league in Sao Paulo.Now known as Red Bull Bragantino, the club have been on a roll ever since."We were looking for a club with a good story, devoted fans and a strong connection with their home city. We were lucky to find all that and more in Bragantino," said the club's executive director, Thiago Scuro.Flush with Red Bull cash, Bragantino built a team that easily won the second division.The changes do not stop there. They are renovating their stadium and overhauling the club's internal machinery."Red Bull took on Bragantino with the intention of raising the club's level across the board," Scuro told AFP."We've had good results on the pitch. At the same time, we're also working hard on management, on improving the club's infrastructure."Global brandFounded in 1987 by Austrian businessman Dietrich Mateschitz, Red Bull launched its caffeine-loaded drink on the international market in 1994, and has been charging into new business areas at a fearsome pace ever since.The firm built unique name recognition with extreme sports competitions such as the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series and Red Bull Air Race, before branching out into the more traditional brand-building business of football.Red Bull-affiliated clubs "are independently managed in their home countries, but we have a lot of contact with each other -- we share knowledge, methods and best practices," Scuro said.Red Bull Bragantino brought in top-line reinforcements this year from Leipzig (Luan Candido) and Salzburg (Luis Phelipe).They assembled a team of young talent for their return to top-flight football this season, led by former player turned coach Felipe Conceicao.In their first two matches, they battled two league giants to draws: Santos and Botafogo.They will be looking for their first win against Bahia on Sunday -- two days before Leipzig, fresh off their quarter-finals upset of Atletico Madrid, face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League semis."We want to play aggressive attacking football, with a lot of intensity and technical quality," said Scuro."Brazil is a great country to sign young talent."Bragantino spent more signing players this season than any first-division club in Brazil except reigning champions Flamengo.But Scuro said it is not just a matter of money, or of overnight success."Our main goal for 2020 is just to stabilize the club in the first division," he said."It will be a medium-term process. I think in three years we'll have the technical capacity to play at the same level as the major clubs, not because of money, but because of technical excellence, an established style of play and because we're investing in young players who will improve every year."",

Let's say you've taken $10,000 and you listen to the prophets of doom and gloom around you -- and you'll get that constantly throughout your life. And instead, you use the $10,000 to buy gold. Now, for your $10,000 you would have been able to buy about 300 ounces of gold. And while the businesses were reinvesting in more plants and new inventions came along, you would get down every year and you look in your safe deposit box and you'd have your 300 ounces of gold. And you could look at it and you could fondle it and you could, I mean, whatever you wanted to do with it. But it didn't produce anything. It was never going to produce anything. And what would you have today? You would have 300 ounces of gold just like you had in March of 1942.
