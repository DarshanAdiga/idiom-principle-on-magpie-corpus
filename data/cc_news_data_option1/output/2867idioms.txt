That leads me to the final action step we can take as white allies in the outdoor scene: Support the work being done by Black and Brown outdoor adventurers. Find and follow them on social media, so that their numbers are unignorable by the big brands. If they represent a big brand already, use their discount code when you buy gear. Share their imagery and stories with others. (And for the love of God, don’t make the mistake of calling attention to yourself when you do it.) Some argue that this is tokenism -- that’s just white-centric smoke and mirrors. Is it tokenism when you tell everyone you know about a great indie band, an underground fashion label, or an amazing restaurant hidden in a suburban strip mall?

Ben Stokes is making it difficult for England selectors to give him a break by consistently turning in stellar performances, coach Chris Silverwood admitted on Tuesday.
 All-rounder Stokes scored 176 and 78 not out as well as taking three wickets during the home side's 113-run win over the West Indies in the second Test at Old Trafford on Monday.
 That performance took him to the top of the Test all-rounder rankings ahead of the third and final Test of the series, starting at the Manchester ground on Friday.
 England, with the series tied at 1-1, could field three fresh fast bowlers in James Anderson, Mark Wood and Jofra Archer.
 The home side are wary of bowling their quicks into the ground during a punishing schedule of six Tests in seven weeks, with a Pakistan Test series to come.
 Despite a tight turnaround, it would still be a surprise if England chose to rest Stokes this week.
 "We want him out there as much as we can -- everyone can see how good he is," said Silverwood. "But you know what, we're going to consider it (resting Stokes).
 "He's been at the centre of the last couple of games now and we've got to make sure he's OK. But if he is fit and healthy and good to go, he'll play."
 Paceman Stokes was unable to complete his 15th over in West Indies' second innings but after the match gave the reassuring message that there was "absolutely nothing to worry about".
 Former England paceman Silverwood said the key was to make sure the 29-year- old did not train too hard.
 "He'll keep pushing himself, which is why he is as good as he is," said Silverwood.
 "But from a training perspective we try and rein him in where possible and keep him as fit as a fiddle because I know we're a better team with him out there... We've got to look after him the best we can."
 \- No. 1 all-rounder -
 Stokes' man-of-the-match effort in Manchester saw him displace West Indies captain Jason Holder as the world's best Test all-rounder in the International Cricket Council rankings.
 He has also climbed to joint third in the Test batting rankings.
 "The stats don't lie, do they?" said Silverwood. "He's on the crest of a wave at the moment so we've got to make sure he stays there. All the accolades he's getting, he deserves."
 Silverwood said Stokes had already inspired up-and-coming England players during an expanded training group in a bio-secure bubble at Southampton -- the venue for the first Test -- created in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
 "One of the great things about having a larger group is the fact that we got to put so many young cricketers around these guys.
 "Ben, Jos (Buttler), all these guys, their fitness standards have gone through the roof and everybody has improved over the lockdown period.
 "People come in and see how they work, how they train, not just from a fitness point of view, but also their work ethic in the nets."

One of the most moving examples involved Yanira herself. While guiding a group hike up Crowder’s Mountain in North Carolina, she saw one woman struggling to keep up. Her backpack was overloaded, her asthma was acting up, and she revealed to Yanira that her boyfriend had discouraged her from coming on the hike, telling her she wouldn’t be able to make it. When they got to a trail section that involved scrambling over boulders, the woman flinched. “She said ‘There’s no way I can do that.’ I said no, you can do it -- you go first and I’ll push you up as needed.” When the boulder section gave way to the crest of the mountain, Yanira says the woman unexpectedly lifted up her arms and screamed, as though the boyfriend could hear her, “I knew I could do it! You told me I couldn’t do it without you -- I don’t need you!” Yanira tears up recounting the story, still moved by nature’s ability to break someone down and instantly rebuild them stronger than ever.

Hopping mad Florida authorities have charged a local with a string of misdemeanors after his pet kangaroo escaped and bounced around town.
 Jack, the two-year-old runaway, was spotted leaping through the streets of Fort Lauderdale last Thursday, prompting people to alert the police.
 "There's a kangaroo hopping around on Andrews between 13th and 16th," one caller said, according to the Sun Sentinel newspaper.
 "Seriously. I know you probably think I'm crazy but everyone was stopping and looking and almost hitting it and I don't want it to get hit."
 Police showed up and managed to get the animal in the back of a cruiser.
 Body-cam footage shows the officers gingerly grabbing the animal from behind and slipping a red leash around his neck.
 "We actually captured the kangaroo," one officer says as he radios in the arrest, as colleagues chuckle and pet the animal.
 They later took Jack to a stable for police horses.
 Jack's owner, identified as Anthony Macias, said the animal lived at his house with his Corgi Max.
 "They love each other," he told the Sun Sentinel. "They play and run around."
 Male kangaroos can grow up to six foot seven inches (two meters) and weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms). In Fort Lauderdale people are not allowed to keep the animals as pets.
 So Macias was charged Tuesday with three misdemeanors.
 "One for allowing the escape of the kangaroo and one for having no records of acquisition of the kangaroo, and one infraction for not having a license to possess the kangaroo," said Carol Lyn Parish of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission.
 She said the roo had been transferred to a temporary facility until his forever home can be found.
 Macias faces 60 days in jail and a fine of up to $500 if convicted.

As Outdoor Afro has grown, they have added a new core component to their mission: Helping outdoor companies see inequity and shift the work that they do. “They come to us for consulting, for models, for imagery. We know the shift is there and we’re proud to have been a catalyst.” These companies, with their vast social reach, their millions of funding dollars, and the influence they wield over policy, play a vital role in shaping the character of the outdoor community as a whole. Yanira says the team at Outdoor Afro holds these companies rigorously to account, not only for the diversity within their marketing imagery, but also in their practices and partnerships. “We look at who are their partners, and their foundation arm,” Yanira urges. “Who are they in bed with? Who are they giving money to? Who are they collaborating with? That gives a good sense of where they are.” Even the brands that have checked the “diverse representation” box don’t get a pass. “How are they dealing with haters? Are they letting the comments just slide, or going back and saying ‘That’s not something that we condone on our pages.’ Some brands will say ‘We don’t deal with comments’ and I’ll say ‘Well, maybe you should.’”
