The popular solution to this is the locking differential, commonly fitted to four-wheel drive vehicles that don't have time to get stuck. Often available as a factory option, they can also be fitted as an aftermarket upgrade to most popular four-wheel drives and trucks. Available in air and electrically activated versions, when switched on, they lock both sides of the differential together, forcing them to spin at the same speed. This allows greater torque to be supplied to whichever wheel actually has traction, making for much better progress in mud, sand and snow. The trick is that they can be switched on and off, so once back on road, the vehicle can be driven without suffering all the drawbacks of a locked differential on a high-grip surface -- like drivetrain damage and annoying tyre squeal around corners.

“Allow us to have the magic Wand! We will wave it and ‘Poof de Presto’ hundreds of thousands of jobs will mightily appear!      “Fields will be lush and green with wonderful crops. Ranches will fill our plates with premium beef. Gold nuggets will be found laying on the streets. Foreign countries, including our neighbours to the south, will be phoning, pleading for our oil and gas, and looking for investment opportunities. Fantastic days will be upon us all in Alberta. Yes, just give us the magic wand.”      Maybe that’s laying it on slightly too thick. But it seems just one step to that from what Alberta provincial civil servants are today arguing.      Our UCP government asks those employed by the Province to take a four per cent wage cut. They also want some job descriptions changed, so some employees may see another three per cent cut on top of that.      These are challenging times for everybody. Except, as you may have noticed, the story that, “We are all in this together” doesn’t ring true for certain chunks of the economy.      On the one side, we have energy patch workers being tossed on the streets. Most aren’t even asked if they will take a 20 or 25 per cent wage cut.      Small business owners are working everywhere for amounts from zero to just enough to put some oatmeal on the table and pay the electricity.      Restaurant, hotel and other staff in so many other businesses were all on government programs as their business places were closed.      The list of private enterprise businesses seeing zero sales, or at a minimum big declines, is extremely long.      Meanwhile, other chunks are booming. Hardware stores are having great times as stay-at-home people fix their homes. Some fast food outlets are doing fine as their regular competitions are closed. Online ventures like Amazon and Netflix are grinning from A to Z. Forestry is coming back from several years of average and even decline as mostly, the American economy returns to home building in a big way.      So even though Alberta as a province is going in the hole by $24 billion this year, things aren’t all that bad for some. The money amount is about $5,700 for each and every citizen in this province.      Premier Jason Kenney wants all government employees to take that four per cent cut. According to Rachel Notley, a whole bunch of civil servants earn “only” $50,000 per year. She never said anything about gold-plated benefits and pensions. So even those “hard done by folks” earning that “small” amount will have to shoulder an “immense” $2,000 per year directly.      Indirectly, of course, we all get whacked.      Meanwhile, if you can believe it, the AUPE union that argues for civil servants, instead wants government workers to all get a five per cent raise! Maybe they figure that arguing from a high ask is good tactics. They can then allow themselves to be whittled down to a tiny one or two per cent.      This is unbounded idiocy. We are all, if you can forgive the sarcasm, in this together. As usual, some are just more “in this” than others.

(AP) - After nearly two years and a pair of deadly crashes, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has cleared Boeing’s 737 Max for flight.The nation’s air safety agency announced the move early Wednesday, saying it was done after a “comprehensive and methodical” 20-month review process.Regulators around the world grounded the Max in March 2019, after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet. That happened less than five months after another Max flown by Indonesia’s Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea. A total of 346 passengers and crew members on both planes were killed.Federal Aviation Administration chief Stephen Dickson signed an order Wednesday rescinding the grounding. U.S. airlines will be able to fly the Max once Boeing updates critical software and computers on each plane and pilots receive training in flight simulators.The FAA says the order was made in cooperation with air safety regulators worldwide.The move follows exhaustive congressional hearings on the crashes that led to criticism of the FAA for lax oversight and Boeing for rushing to implement a new software system that put profits over safety and ultimately led to the firing of its CEO.Investigators focused on anti- stall software that Boeing had devised to counter the plane’s tendency to tilt nose-up because of the size and placement of the engines. That software pushed the nose down repeatedly on both planes that crashed, overcoming the pilots' struggles to regain control. In each case, a single faulty sensor triggered the nose-down pitch.The new software now requires inputs from two sensors in order to activate the software. Boeing says the software also does not override the pilot’s controls like it did in the past.The company changed the software so it doesn’t repeatedly point the nose of the plane down to counteract possible aerodynamic stalling. Boeing also must install new display systems for pilots and change the way wires are routed to a tail stabilizer bar.On CNBC Wednesday, Dickson said the design and pilot training changes required by the FAA “makes it impossible for the airplanes to have the same kind of accident that unfortunately killed 346 people.”Boeing shares rose 3.5% to $217.38 in early trading Wednesday. That’s about half of the all-time high of $440.62 reached on March 1, 2019, just days before the Ethiopian crash, but well above the $95 trough in March, when the pandemic caused massive disruptions to travel and the global economy.“These events and the lessons we have learned as a result have reshaped our company and further focused our attention on our core values of safety, quality and integrity,” Boeing CEO David Calhoun said in a statement.The aircraft maker’s redemption comes in the middle of a pandemic that has scared away passengers and decimated the aviation industry, limiting the company’s ability to make a comeback. Air travel in the U.S. alone is down about 65% from a year ago.Boeing sales of new planes have plunged because of the Max crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. Orders for more than 1,000 Max jets&nbsp;have been canceled or removed&nbsp;from Boeing’s backlog this year. Each plane has a sticker price of $99 million to $135 million, although airlines routinely pay less.John Hansman, an aeronautics professor at MIT, said people typically avoid airplanes for a few months after there are problems. But the Max case is unusual, and were it not for the novel coronavirus, Hansman said he would feel safe flying on a Max.“This whole thing has had more scrutiny than any airplane in the world,” he said. “It’s probably the safest airplane to be on.”American is the only U.S. airline to put the Max back in its schedule so far, starting with one round trip daily between New York and Miami beginning Dec. 29. United expects to start using the plane early next year, while Southwest said its Max jets won’t fly before the second quarter of 2021.Some consumer groups urged airlines to fully disclose when Max flights are planned. That’s usually on an airline’s website, although passengers have to know where to click. Advocates are concerned about airlines using the Max in a last-minute switch.Nearly 400 Max jets were in service worldwide when they were grounded, and Boeing has built and stored about 450 more since then. All have to undergo maintenance before they can fly.Pilots must also undergo simulator training, which was not required when the aircraft was introduced. Hansman said training for qualified 737 pilots shouldn’t take long because Boeing has fixed software problems.Relatives of people who died in the crashes aren’t convinced the Max is safe. They accused Boeing of hiding critical design features from the FAA.“The flying public should avoid the Max,” said Michael Stumo, whose 24-year-old daughter died in the second crash. “Change your flight. This is still a more dangerous aircraft than other modern planes.”Boeing’s reputation has taken a beating since the crashes. Its then-CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, initially suggested that the foreign pilots were to blame. However, congressional investigators discovered an FAA analysis — conducted after the first Max crash — that predicted there would be&nbsp;15 more crashes during the plane’s life span&nbsp;if the flight-control software were not fixed.After an 18-month investigation,&nbsp;the House Transportation Committee heaped blame on Boeing, which was under pressure to develop the Max to compete with a plane from European rival Airbus, and the FAA, which certified the Max and was the last agency in the world to ground it after the crashes. The investigators said Boeing suffered from a “culture of concealment,” and pressured engineers to rush the plane to the market.Boeing was repeatedly wrong about how quickly it could fix the plane. When those predictions continued to be wrong, and Boeing was perceived as putting undue pressure on the FAA,&nbsp;Muilenburg was fired&nbsp;in December 2019.Dickson — a former Air Force and Delta Air Lines pilot — flew the plane personally before it was cleared.Europe’s aviation regulator, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, said it will take public comment on plans to clear the Max for flight and expects to finalize a plan by early next year. Some EU states will have to lift their own grounding notices as well. Regulators in Canada and China are still doing their own reviews.Relatives say it’s too soon, and they and their lawyers say Boeing and the FAA are withholding documents. Anton Sahadi, who lives in Jakarta, Indonesia, and lost two brothers in the Lion Air crash, said it’s too early for the Max to fly again.“The cases from the incidents are not 100% finished yet,” he said. “I think all the victims' family in Indonesia and Ethiopia will feel the same, so regretful, why it can fly again because we are still in the recovery process for our problems because of the incidents.”Naoise Ryan, an Irish citizen whose husband died in the Ethiopian crash, said the Max is “the same airplane that crashed not once but twice because safety was not a priority for this company.”___Koenig, who reported from Dallas, can be reached at www.twitter.com/airlinewriter.

Growing up - and now, even as a 26-year-old man - I will purposefully keep my mouth closed when photographs are being taken, ensuring my teeth are on show for as little time as possible. The main problem is the large gap that resides between my front two teeth, and also the fact that they are, shall we say, over-pronounced. The damage was done due to thumb-sucking and, around the age of 10, my dad paid £100 for me to have a private orthodontist appointment to see about getting retainers and what were then called 'train track' braces. However, back then, these retainers were chunky, uncomfortable and pretty painful - safe to say, I did not get on with them at all. They irritated me so much that I gave up on them and didn't even get to the train tracks part of the process; something that my dad will guilt trip me about to this day. In the years since, however, I have learned to just get on with it and push the negative thoughts about my teeth to the back of my mind. But, being a journalist who often interviews people in person or (in these times) via Zoom, showing my teeth has become unavoidable. So, when I started to see advertising pop ups on my Instagram and Facebook pages about Invisalign earlier this year, I started to look at what could be done. I also began to notice that several people who were in my school year had gone through the Invisalign process - with impressive results. I then looked on the Invisalign website and found their 'virtual smile view', which is where you simply snap a selfie to see what you could look like with straighter teeth, in under 60 seconds. To say I was impressed with the envisioned result would be an understatement. After doing some research (aka social media stalking) I discovered that Invisalign was being offered in my nearest town, at March Dental Surgery, by Dr Kishan Patel. Following a brief conversation via social media, Dr Patel had booked me in for a virtual consultation; these are all free and last for around half an hour. During the virtual consultation - which minimised the need for physical interaction, especially in light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic - I was asked what it was that I wanted to change. I was then talked through the process in a simple and easy to understand manner and shown a price list in relation to what my treatment would cost. The biggest sell for me, though, was that Dr Patel told me my teeth could be straight and gapless within just 15 weeks. At first, I wasn't quite sure how it would work so quickly - especially when 'train track' braces need at least a year to do their job. But Dr Patel told me that by wearing the Invisalign retainer - a tiny transparent piece of plastic that slots under the teeth and is virtually invisible - for 22 hours a day (removing when eating or drinking), the magic would happen in that impressive timeframe. I was sold, and have since visited the practice for my initial X-rays and scans. Watch this space.

"My pro-Palestinian stance began to chafe," Ohrstrom writes. "Since 2007, I've worn a necklace with my name written in Arabic, and Ivanka grew increasingly irritated by it. Sometimes, she would randomly say, 'I hate that thing.'"
 Ohrstrom adds, "Then one night in the middle of dinner, she glanced at the necklace and said, 'How does your Jewish boyfriend feel when you are having sex and that necklace hits him (in) the face? How can you wear that thing? It just screams terrorist.'"
 Ohrstrom also remembers when, during a conversation about the exorbitant rents in Manhattan, Trump said something along the lines of, "I can't talk about this stuff with you anymore because you've really turned into a Marxist."
 The journalist makes it clear how vehemently she disagrees with the politics of President Donald Trump's administration, noting that she voted for President-elect Joe Biden.

It's the perfect spot for her to lie low, shielded from the economic and social consequences of the policies she pursued for the past four years, the backlash against them, and from having to interact with her MAGA following."

In December 1972, I was part of a nationwide campaign that came tantalizingly close to getting the U.S. Senate to reject Earl Butz, then-President Richard Nixon's choice for secretary of agriculture.  
 A coalition of grassroots farmers, consumers and scrappy public interest organizations (such as the Agribusiness Accountability Project that Susan DeMarco and I then headed) teamed up with some gutsy, unabashedly progressive senators to undertake the almost-impossible challenge of defeating the Cabinet nominee of a president who'd just been elected in a landslide.
 The 51-44 Senate vote was so close because we were able to expose Butz as ... well, as butt-ugly — a shameless flack for big food corporations that gouge farmers and consumers alike. We brought the abusive power of corporate agribusiness into the public consciousness for the first time, but we had won only a moral victory, since there he was, ensconced in the seat of power. It horrified us that Nixon had been able to squeeze Butz into that seat, yet it turned out to be a blessing.

The short answer is North Carolina’s wetlands are protected by law as “waters of the State.” If the Department of Environmental Quality lacks a process to authorize activities that would impair or destroy wetlands, the wetlands are categorically protected and those activities are prohibited.
 The longer answer requires an understanding of the interplay between federal and state law, and recent missteps by the Environmental Protection Agency and North Carolina General Assembly.
 In 1996, the Environmental Management Commission adopted comprehensive wetland regulations in response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that created uncertainty about the extent of federal protection of wetlands. The state regulations did several discrete things: defined wetlands, protected existing uses of wetlands such as flood retention and water purification, and established a permitting system to authorize activities in wetlands.
 The Environmental Management Commission’s authority to adopt wetlands regulations and protect wetlands as “waters of the State” was challenged in court. We intervened in the case on behalf of the North Carolina Coastal Federation and other organizations to help defend the Commission’s authority. In 2002, the North Carolina Court of Appeals ruled wetlands are “waters of the State” and fully upheld the Commission’s duty to regulate activities impairing or destroying wetlands.
 For many years, the federal and state partnership in protecting wetlands worked, with the State, as necessary, supplementing federal protection by requiring State authorization for activities impairing or destroying wetlands.
 Then in 2018, the North Carolina General Assembly took the shortsighted action of enacting a law that repealed the part of the Environmental Management Commission’s regulations establishing a permitting system to authorize activities in most wetlands.
 Importantly, the legislation only repealed authority to authorize or permit activities in wetlands, not state law or regulations defining wetlands as waters of the State and requiring protection of wetlands. At first, this law had little effect since nearly all wetlands were regulated by federal agencies. The required federal permits allowed the State to both meet its duty to protect wetlands and authorize activities through its authority to certify that the federal permits protected water quality.

Hopkins County Central athletic director Kent Akin liked the benefits the new live streaming system will bring and he thinks that it will not affect Central’s normal attendance at games.
 “Our crowds usually consist of parents, grandparents and our students,” Akin said. “However with parents after their kids play our sports for four or five years, they might not come back as often so this will give them a chance to keep up with our teams and kids in college can watch their former teammates play.”
 According to the agreement, it will cost both North and Central $5,000 from each school to install the live streaming capabilities at their facilities.
 North and Central will have the capabilities to stream events hosted in their venues from all levels including varsity, junior varsity and freshmen as well as postseason events such as the 7th District Tournament and the 2nd Region Tournament.
 “This will be great for those postseason tournaments,” Akin said. “There are a lot of basketball fans around here who like to watch multiple tournaments so if they want to watch North and Central play in the district tournament, they can watch that game on their phones while they watch Hoptown and Christian County play in person.”
 When the system is up and running, fans can find dedicated video portals to North and Central sports on the NFHS Network website at www.nfhsnetwork.com.

 Early on Tuesday, Sen. Chuck Grassley announced that he was quarantining after being exposed to COVID-19. By late afternoon, Grassley released a statement announcing that he had tested positive for the virus, saying "I'll be keeping up on my work for the people of Iowa from home … and I look forward to resuming my normal schedule when I can."
 This is big news for a variety of reasons. One obvious reason is that the Republican Party, its terrible handling the COVID-19 pandemic, and their members' bad public health examples have led to the very real threats of sickness and death within their ranks. The other reason is that Chuck Grassley, up until today, had not missed a Senate vote since 1993. Being in actual COVID-19 quarantine will mean that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's attempts at further packing the courts during the lame duck session of Trump's tenure as corrupter in chief will not include Sen. Grassley's vote.

For example, Ann Molgaard, another victim of CEO Angelo and Director Tammy Chandler's disappearing act, is a former Director of Operations for HHSA, the former Director of First Five, and has a long history of public administration among her many other accomplishments. She is born and bred here and is an attorney. She is sensible and compassionate, willing to listen and learn. She would be a perfect candidate for CEO, but there are many others.

Looking further, you may want to fit brush guards and bash bars to prevent damage to your vehicle from the more gnarly trails out there. These can often serve as great mounting points for additional gear like winches and lights, which can aid in recovery, or help you spot obstacles before you even get stuck in the first place. Having a stout towing point on your vehicle is also key, so you don't rip a bumper off when a friendly Jeep stops by to pull you out. Of course, when wiring in accessories, make sure to use properly rated conductors and weather proof connectors, otherwise your adventures may be cut short by an electrical fire!

Hey there! You! The person who keeps saying, “We are all in this together!”      I want you to tell me if Amazon is in this. I want to know if the online movie and show people like Amazon [again] and Disney and Netflix and Hulu are really in this.      I want to know if those “fulfillment” warehouses right across Canada, full of 6,000 people, each, all shipping boxes are in this.      I want to know if all those parcels and goodies and packages coming from FedEx and DHL and Purolator and Canada Post have all been quarantined and locked up so the boxes, and the workers, don’t spread COVID.      Well? Actually, this whole idea of “essential services” being allowed to open, while thousands of small and large businesses, from Joey’s Diner to Air Canada, across Canada have to lock their doors, is absolutely and without doubt, disgusting.      Now, the experts want to do it all over again. Doctors in Alberta are calling for a two-week “circuit breaker” lockdown. Your local watering hole and coffee shop will shut down.      But the fast food place down the street can keep on slinging burgers and fries! Grocery stores get to stay open! So do liquor stores!      If we are really going to “lock down,” let’s get serious. As in, de-alcohol beer and wine only. Healthy cottage cheese and all-bran cereal only, which has to be ordered in advance, and picked up at the door of the local No Frills or equivalent. No more wandering the aisles, picking up chocolate bars, snacks, fried chicken and pillows and tools.      Lay off half of all government workers! Same with politicians! All can go on Unemployment!      Sorry, folks! We’re all in this together, ya know!      If Jane and John Doe at the local eat-in or gym are going broke, everyone else should take a haircut too.      It’s said one in seven business in Canada is going to go bankrupt because of shutdowns, lockdowns and part closings.      That’s an understatement. Coming is the Christmas season. For many businesses, both big and small, anywhere from 40 to 70 per cent of their annual sales happen in the next five weeks. Moonlight Madness sales? Boxing Day specials? Gift card sales? Loading up on Christmas presents?      Oh, sure! Just buy them all online or at Amazon!      All in this together? Those guys don’t even pay taxes! It would all ring better if, along with some of that government help, we all got a couple shares of Amazon and Netflix to tide us over a bit.      Meanwhile, the recent surge in COVID cases was mapped out, in colour no less, by the Ontario government. Cities like Toronto are “code red.” A few high density places are orange and yellow. All are in big cities. The vast majority of Ontario? All happy green!      But city folk experts call for a province-wide lockdown!      Getting sick of that, “We’re all in this together” yet?      Of course you are! Because no matter how it gets sliced, it sure isn’t that way in real life.

You are 100% correct. People scream and scream and complain everything falls on deaf ears as far as the Board of Supervisors who are supposed to be the ones to hold her accountable. You try to ask the CEO for any information you just get a huge gigantic circular conversation that blame shifts off to everyone and 6 months later you wind up back at the point you started. It's ridiculous the games that they play and the lack of efficiency all of the money that gets awarded for Grants or new programs gets wasted and squandered down by the higher-ups before anything even happens. It's pretty gosh darn pathetic to watch this happening over and over again when smaller counties arerun much more efficiently and even larger counties run fantastically well and here we are in our swirling cesspool. No help from the higher-ups no help from the attorney general, grand jury reports fall on deaf ears. We should change the name of Mendocino County to Tarpit County. Because that's basically what happens everything gets stuck in the tar pits and that's it.

I also began to notice that several people who were in my school year had gone through the Invisalign process – with impressive results.
 I then looked on the Invisalign website and found their ‘virtual smile view’, which is where you simply snap a selfie to see what you could look like with straighter teeth, in under 60 seconds.
 To say I was impressed with the envisioned result would be an understatement.
 After doing some research (aka social media stalking) I discovered that Invisalign was being offered in my nearest town, at March Dental Surgery, by Dr Kishan Patel.
 Following a brief conversation via social media, Dr Patel had booked me in for a virtual consultation; these are all free and last for around half an hour.
 During the virtual consultation – which minimised the need for physical interaction, especially in light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic – I was asked what it was that I wanted to change.
 I was then talked through the process in a simple and easy to understand manner and shown a price list in relation to what my treatment would cost.
 The biggest sell for me, though, was that Dr Patel told me my teeth could be straight and gapless within just 15 weeks.
 At first, I wasn’t quite sure how it would work so quickly - especially when ‘train track’ braces need at least a year to do their job.
 But Dr Patel told me that by wearing the Invisalign retainer - a tiny transparent piece of plastic that slots under the teeth and is virtually invisible – for 22 hours a day (removing when eating or drinking), the magic would happen in that impressive timeframe.
 I was sold, and have since visited the practice for my initial X-rays and scans. Watch this space.

Federal Aviation Administration chief Stephen Dickson signed an order Wednesday rescinding the grounding. U.S. airlines will be able to fly the Max once Boeing updates critical software and computers on each plane and pilots receive training in flight simulators.
 The FAA says the order was made in cooperation with air safety regulators worldwide. “Those regulators have indicated that Boeing’s design changes, together with the changes to crew procedures and training enhancements, will give them the confidence to validate the aircraft as safe to fly in their respective countries and regions,” the FAA said in a statement.
 The move follows exhaustive congressional hearings on the crashes that led to criticism of the FAA for lax oversight and Boeing for rushing to implement a new software system that put profits over safety and ultimately led to the firing of its CEO.
 Investigators focused on anti-stall software that Boeing had devised to counter the plane’s tendency to tilt nose-up because of the size and placement of the engines. That software pushed the nose down repeatedly on both planes that crashed, overcoming the pilots’ struggles to regain control. In each case, a single faulty sensor triggered the nose-down pitch.
 The FAA required Boeing to change the software so it doesn’t repeatedly point the nose of the plane down to counteract possible aerodynamic stalling. Boeing says the software also does not override the pilot’s controls like it did in the past. Boeing also must install new display systems for pilots and change the way wires are routed to a tail stabilizer bar.
 “These events and the lessons we have learned as a result have reshaped our company and further focused our attention on our core values of safety, quality and integrity," Boeing CEO David Calhoun said in a statement.
 Boeing’s redemption comes in the middle of a pandemic that has scared away passengers and decimated the aviation industry, limiting the company's ability to make a comeback. Air travel in the U.S. alone is down about 65% from a year ago.
 Boeing sales of new planes have plunged because of the Max crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. Orders for more than 1,000 Max jets have been canceled or removed from Boeing’s backlog this year. Each plane carries a sticker price between $99 million and $135 million, although airlines routinely pay far less than list price.
 John Hansman, an aeronautics professor at MIT, said that people typically avoid airplanes for a few months after there are problems. But the Max case is unusual, and were it not for the novel coronavirus, Hansman said he would feel safe flying on a Max.
 “This whole thing has had more scrutiny than any airplane in the world,” he said. “It’s probably the safest airplane to be on.”
