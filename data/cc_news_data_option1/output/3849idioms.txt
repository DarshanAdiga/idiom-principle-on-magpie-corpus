Continuing to evolve with the COVID-19 pandemic, Pocono Mountains Music Festival will be hosting a "drive-in, dine-out" event outside Buck Hill's Fairway Grille on Saturday, Oct. 3.
   
 The free 5 p.m. concert features Klea Blackhurst, who will perform her "Autumn in New York" show.
   
 "The way it's set up, the golf course is sort of behind the stage, it's like the backdrop, and it's going to be so beautiful with the leaves turning and everything," said Scott Coulter, the festival's artistic director.
   
 Aside from offering entertainment adapted to social distancing guidelines, the concert is part of an effort to have more year-round events.
   
 Blackhurst has been involved in the festival for years, both performing and teaching at the performing arts camp.
   
 "I sing everywhere, and now I'm starting to sing in interesting places like golf club parking lots," Blackhurst said. "It's a whole new world."
   
 Attendees can stay in their cars and listen on a unique FM station, sit on the lawn, or sit at the Grille's outdoor seating and order food. (Reservations must be made by Wednesday, Sept. 30 for that option. Call 570-595-3535.)
   
 This is the second drive-in, dine-out the festival has put on this year, and more tables will be available based on past demand.
   
 Whether she's in a small cabaret room, a symphony hall that seats thousands, or outside a golf course, the goal is always "to play the space you're in, to be appropriate to the space you're in," said Blackhurst, who is known for "Everything The Traffic Will Allow," an award-winning tribute to Ethel Merman.
   
 "I don't think it really alters anything in terms of my usual performance style," she said. "This is the space, these are the people, these are the faces, and we're going to let the airwaves pick up the rest and just do it. I think it'll be really fun. I love the idea of the driving in part."
   
 The bigger change is the response, Coulter said. Applause is replaced by honking horns and flashing lights.
   
 There are fewer opportunities for live entertainment, but performances can connect people in new ways, too. Coulter attended the first union-approved production of the pandemic, "Godspell" in the Berkshires.
   
 "We were all under this tent, and we were all masked, and we were all socially distanced," he said. "Oddly enough, it was the best 'Godspell' I've ever seen, because it felt like we were all part of that group telling the story."
   
 Coulter has an eye on next summer's festival and camp, and most of the scrapped plans for 2020 have been carried forward -- assuming the situation has improved enough to allow a music festival.
   
 "The problem is, nobody knows when to start booking," said Coulter, who has a concert production company and books shows around the country. There's a "very fine line" between trying to line up shows for when theaters do reopen, and recognizing that furloughed theater staff might not be in the office.
   
 It's easier said than done -- and the pandemic has certainly been tragic -- but this year has provided opportunities to be creative.
   
 "At certain times it's such a great opportunity to just roll with it," Blackhurst said. "We're going to either drive ourselves crazy or we're going to roll into wonderful new situations that we could not possibly have imagined."

TALLAHASSEE, Florida, EE.UU. (AP) — El gobernador Ron DeSantis levantó el viernes todas las restricciones a restaurantes y otros negocios en Florida, y prohibió las multas locales a quienes se rehúsen a usar mascarillas, a fin de reabrir la economía del estado a pesar de la propagación del coronavirus. La orden del gobernador republicano suscitó una nueva polémica en el estado, donde las acciones contra la pandemia se han entrelazado con las próximas elecciones presidenciales. DeSantis, un aliado del presidente Donald Trump, reconoció que la pandemia dista de haber terminado, pero afirmó que el peligro ha disminuido y que ha llegado la hora de reabrir los negocios después de seis meses en los que la gente ha quedado en el desamparo. El anunció del viernes del gobernador autoriza a los restaurantes en todo el estado a reabrir de inmediato a toda su capacidad e impide a las ciudades y condados que les ordenen cerrar o funcionar a menos de la mitad de su capacidad, a menos que puedan justificar un cierre por motivos económicos o sanitarios. “No cerraremos nada de ahora en adelante”, dijo DeSantis, mientras insistía en que el estado está preparado en caso de que vuelvan a aumentar las infecciones. Sin embargo, el gobernador permitió a los gobiernos locales restringir el funcionamiento de los bares a 50% de su capacidad, pero agregó que él “no va a interponerse en el camino” para permitirles reabrir totalmente. Como parte de su plan de reapertura, el gobernador prohibió a las ciudades y condados multar a quienes violen la normativa del distanciamiento social o no utilicen mascarilla. La orden del gobernador prácticamente anula los decretos locales impuestos para limitar la propagación del coronavirus. “Creo que debemos apartarnos de la...
